Abstract = {{Double-helix point spread functions (DH-PSFs) have been used to extend
   localization and super-resolution microscopy to three dimensions.
   Current DH-PSF design provides a long depth-of-field for 3D imaging.
   However, it is not optimal for imaging under high background conditions.
   We present a method to design unconventional DH-PSFs with control on
   characteristics such as efficiency, transverse spread, and Fisher
   information. This allows tailoring the PSFs for specific applications.
   In particular, we introduce a design suitable for 3D localization-based
   super-resolution imaging under typical background conditions and
   demonstrate imaging with resolution one order of magnitude beyond the
   diffraction limit over a depth-of-field of 1.2 mu m.}},

Abstract = {{We report a versatile approach for the generation of novel
   nanoparticle-templated microbubbles capable of simultaneous contrast
   enhancement in both ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging. Fabrication of
   the dual modality contrast agent relies on specific binding of
   avidinated gold nanoparticles to a biotinylated microbubble shell,
   providing stoichiometric control over nanoparticle surface density and
   optical absorption, while still retaining the essential acoustic
   properties of the microbubble. Nanoparticle laden microbubbles were
   shown to be exceptionally efficient photoacoustic agents, with an
   enhanced photoacoustic response compared to free nanoparticles or
   unconjugated mixtures of nanoparticles and microbubbles. Upon
   destruction of the microbubble gas core, a marked reduction in
   photoacoustic signal amplitude was observed, demonstrating the
   importance of placing the nanoparticles onto a compressible gas core in
   achieving the photoacoustic enhancement. We further demonstrate dual
   modality contrast enhanced photoacoustic and ultrasound imaging in a
   flow-through tissue phantom. Our results show that
   nanoparticle-templated microbubbles are promising for imaging,
   biosensing and theranostic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) was used as a model in
   lyophilized formulations to investigate how protein degradation pathways
   of aggregation, deamidation and oxidation are linked to glassy state
   dynamics and the structure of protein immobilized in glassy matrices.
   This study examined formulations of rhGH combined with the disaccharides
   sucrose or trehalose and various amounts of hydroxyethyl starch (HES),
   which upon lyophilization yielded glasses with a wide range of retention
   of native protein structure and glass transition temperatures. After
   storage at temperatures of 313, 323 and 333 K for periods of up to 16
   weeks, samples were analyzed for protein secondary structure, the amount
   of various types of protein degradation, as well as structural
   relaxation time and the local mobility. Surprisingly, protein
   degradation rates were higher in formulations with higher glass
   transition temperatures and slower global dynamic motions. Formulations
   in which the protein retained more native-like structure immediately
   following lyophilization exhibited better stability, and these
   formulations also showed larger free energy barriers to structural
   perturbations. Protein structure and local mobility in the glass were
   strongly correlated with rate constants for aggregation, deamidation and
   oxidation local mobility within the glassy matrices, but degradation
   rates had different dependencies on these stability metrics at different
   temperatures.dagger}},

Abstract = {{The Bering Glacier-Bagley Icefield system in Alaska is currently surging
   (2011). Large-scale elevation changes and small-scale elevation-change
   characteristics are investigated to understand surge progression,
   especially mass transport from the pre-surge reservoir area to the
   receiving area and propagation of the kinematic surge wave as manifested
   in heavy crevassing characteristic of rapid, brittle deformation. This
   analysis is based on airborne laser altimeter data collected over Bering
   Glacier in September 2011. Results include the following: (1) Maximal
   crevasse depth is 60 m, reached in a rift that separates two deformation
   domains, indicative of two different flow regimes. Otherwise surge
   crevasse depth reaches 20-30 m. (2) Characteristic parameters of
   structural provinces are derived by application of geostatistical
   classification. Parameters include significance and spacing of
   crevasses, surface roughness and crevasse-edge curvature (indicative of
   crevasse age). A classification based on these parameters serves to
   objectively discriminate structural provinces, indicative of surge
   progression down-glacier and up-glacier. (3) Elevation changes from 2011
   and 2010 altimetry show 40-70 m surface lowering in the reservoir area
   in lower central Bering Glacier and 20-40 m thickening near the front in
   Tashalich arm. Combining elevation changes with results of crevasse
   profilometry and pattern analysis, the rapid progression of the surge
   can be mathematically-physically reconstructed.}},

Abstract = {{The relative strength of small rubble pile asteroids is scale dependent,
   with strength increasing as size decreases due to the ubiquitous but
   weak van der Waals cohesive forces that exist between materials. This
   counters classical theory that rubble pile asteroids should behave as
   scale-independent cohesionless collections of rocks. We propose a simple
   model for asteroid strength that is based on these weak forces, validate
   it through granular mechanics simulations and comparisons with
   properties of lunar regolith. Then show its implications and ability to
   explain and predict observed properties of small asteroids in the NEA
   and Main Belt populations. A conclusion is that the population of
   rapidly rotating asteroids consists of both distributions of smaller
   grains (i.e., rubble piles) and of monolithic boulders whose surfaces
   may still retain a size distribution of finer grains, potentially of
   size up to centimeters.}},

Title = {{Polydisperse homopolymer grafts stabilize dispersions of nanoparticles

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a computational study of the effect of
   polydispersity in grafted polymers on the effective interactions between
   polymer grafted nanoparticles in a polymer matrix, when graft and matrix
   polymers are chemically identical. The potential of mean force (PMF)
   between grafted particles, calculated using a self-consistent PRISM
   theory-Monte Carlo simulation approach, shows that graft polydispersity
   weakens the attractive well at intermediate inter-particle distances,
   eliminating the well completely at high polydispersity index (PDI). The
   elimination of the mid-range attractive well is due to the longer grafts
   in the polydisperse distribution that introduce steric repulsion at
   large distances, and the increased wetting of the grafted layer by
   matrix chains arising from reduced monomer crowding within the
   polydisperse grafted layer. Trends in how the PMF changes as a function
   of grafting density, ratio of matrix to graft length, and packing
   fraction of polymer matrix seen for monodisperse grafts are preserved
   for polydisperse grafts. Comparison of a log-normal distribution to a
   bidisperse distribution of chain lengths (with equal number of short and
   long chains) with the same PDI and average length, shows that the
   polydisperse distribution can better stabilize dispersions than the
   bidisperse distributions because of the longer chains in the
   polydisperse distribution. Additionally, in a bidisperse distribution,
   with all chains shorter than the matrix chain length, there is a
   reduction in the mid-range attraction, thus confirming the role of
   reduced monomer crowding in the bidisperse grafted layer in increasing
   the grafted layer wetting by the matrix chains, and, as a result,
   improving miscibility of grafted particles and matrix.}},

Title = {{Lung Surfactant Microbubbles Increase Lipophilic Drug Payload for
   Ultrasound-Targeted Delivery}},
Journal = {{THERANOSTICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{409-419}},
Abstract = {{The cavitation response of circulating microbubbles to targeted
   ultrasound can be used for noninvasive, site-specific delivery of
   shell-loaded materials. One challenge for microbubble-mediated delivery
   of lipophilic compounds is the limitation of drug loading into the
   microbubble shell, which is commonly a single phospholipid monolayer. In
   this study, we investigated the use of natural lung surfactant extract
   (Survanta (R), Abbott Nutrition) as a microbubble shell material in
   order to improve drug payload and delivery. Pulmonary surfactant
   extracts such as Survanta contain hydrophobic surfactant proteins (SP-B
   and SP-C) that facilitate lipid folding and retention on lipid
   monolayers. Here, we show that Survanta-based microbubbles exhibit
   wrinkles in bright-field microscopy and increased lipid retention on the
   microbubble surface in the form of surface-associated aggregates
   observed with fluorescence microscopy. The payload of a model lipophilic
   drug (DiO), measured by flow cytometry, increased by over 2-fold
   compared to lipid-coated microbubbles lacking SP-B and SP-C. Lung
   surfactant microbubbles were highly echogenic to contrast enhanced
   ultrasound imaging at low acoustic intensities. At higher ultrasound
   intensity, excess lipid was observed to be acoustically cleaved for
   localized release. To demonstrate targeting, a biotinylated lipopolymer
   was incorporated into the shell, and the microbubbles were subjected to
   a sequence of radiation force and fragmentation pulses as they passed
   through an avidinated hollow fiber. Lung surfactant microbubbles showed
   a 3-fold increase in targeted deposition of the model fluorescent drug
   compared to lipid-only microbubbles. Our results demonstrate that lung
   surfactant microbubbles maintain the acoustic responsiveness of
   lipid-coated microbubbles with the added benefit of increased lipophilic
   drug payload.}},

Title = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and select aldehydes in cloud and fog
   water: the role of the aqueous phase in impacting trace gas budgets}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{5117-5135}},
Abstract = {{Cloud and fog droplets efficiently scavenge and process water-soluble
   compounds and, thus, modify the chemical composition of the gas and
   particle phases. The concentrations of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in
   the aqueous phase reach concentrations on the order of similar to 10 mgC
   L-1 which is typically on the same order of magnitude as the sum of
   inorganic anions. Aldehydes and carboxylic acids typically comprise a
   large fraction of DOC because of their high solubility. The dissolution
   of species in the aqueous phase can lead to (i) the removal of species
   from the gas phase preventing their processing by gas phase reactions
   (e. g., photolysis of aldehydes) and (ii) the formation of unique
   products that do not have any efficient gas phase sources (e. g.,
   dicarboxylic acids).
   We present measurements of DOC and select aldehydes in fog water at high
   elevation and intercepted clouds at a biogenically-impacted location
   (Whistler, Canada) and in fog water in a more polluted area (Davis, CA).
   Concentrations of formaldehyde, glyoxal and methylglyoxal were in the
   micromolar range and comprised <= 2\% each individually of the DOC.
   Comparison of the DOC and aldehyde concentrations to those at other
   locations shows good agreement and reveals highest levels for both in
   anthropogenically impacted regions. Based on this overview, we conclude
   that the fraction of organic carbon (dissolved and insoluble inclusions)
   in the aqueous phase of clouds or fogs, respectively, comprises
   2-similar to 40\% of total organic carbon. Higher values are observed to
   be associated with aged air masses where organics are expected to be
   more highly oxidised and, thus, more soluble. Accordingly, the
   aqueous/gas partitioning ratio expressed here as an effective Henry's
   law constant for DOC (K-H{*}(DOC)) increases by an order of magnitude
   from 7 x 10(3) M atm(-1) to 7 x 10(4) M atm(-1) during the ageing of air
   masses.
   The measurements are accompanied by photochemical box model simulations.
   These simulations are used to contrast two scenarios, i.e., an
   anthropogenically vs. a more biogenically impacted one as being
   representative for Davis and Whistler, respectively. Since the
   simplicity of the box model prevents a fully quantitative prediction of
   the observed aldehyde concentrations, we rather use the model results to
   compare trends in aldehyde partitioning and ratios. They suggest that
   the scavenging of aldehydes by the aqueous phase can reduce HO2 gas
   phase levels significantly by two orders of magnitude due to a weaker
   net source of HO2 production from aldehyde photolysis in the gas phase.
   Despite the high solubility of dicarbonyl compounds (glyoxal,
   methylglyoxal), their impact on the HO2 budget by scavenging is < 10\%
   of that of formaldehyde. The overview of DOC and aldehyde measurements
   presented here reveals that clouds and fogs can be efficient sinks for
   organics, with increasing importance in aged air masses. Even though
   aldehydes, specifically formaldehyde, only comprise similar to 1\% of
   DOC, their scavenging and processing in the aqueous phase might
   translate into significant effects in the oxidation capacity of the
   atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Ten ice-sheet models are used to study sensitivity of the Greenland and
   Antarctic ice sheets to prescribed changes of surface mass balance,
   sub-ice-shelf melting and basal sliding. Results exhibit a large range
   in projected contributions to sea-level change. In most cases, the ice
   volume above flotation lost is linearly dependent on the strength of the
   forcing. Combinations of forcings can be closely approximated by
   linearly summing the contributions from single forcing experiments,
   suggesting that nonlinear feedbacks are modest. Our models indicate that
   Greenland is more sensitive than Antarctica to likely atmospheric
   changes in temperature and precipitation, while Antarctica is more
   sensitive to increased ice-shelf basal melting. An experiment
   approximating the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's RCP8.5
   scenario produces additional first-century contributions to sea level of
   22.3 and 8.1 cm from Greenland and Antarctica, respectively, with a
   range among models of 62 and 14 cm, respectively. By 200 years,
   projections increase to 53.2 and 26.7 cm, respectively, with ranges of
   79 and 43 cm. Linear interpolation of the sensitivity results closely
   approximates these projections, revealing the relative contributions of
   the individual forcings on the combined volume change and suggesting
   that total ice-sheet response to complicated forcings over 200 years can
   be linearized.}},

Abstract = {{Observations of aerosol hygroscopic growth and CCN activation spectra
   for submicron particles are reported for the T1 ground site outside of
   Mexico City during the MIRAGE 2006 campaign. kappa-Kohler theory is used
   to evaluate the characteristic hygroscopicity parameter, kappa{*}, for
   the CCN active aerosol population using both size-resolved HTMDA and
   size-resolved CCNc measurements. Organic mass fractions (f(org)) are
   evaluated from size-resolved aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS)
   measurements, from which predictions of the hygroscopicity parameter are
   compared against kappa{*}. Strong diurnal changes in aerosol water
   uptake parameters and aerosol composition are observed. We find that new
   particle formation (NPF) events are correlated with an increased
   kappa{*} and CCN-active fraction during the daytime, with greater impact
   on smaller particles. During NPF events, the number concentration of 40
   nm particles acting as CCN at 0.51\%+/- 0.06\% supersaturation can
   surpass by more than a factor of two the corresponding concentrations of
   100 nm particles. We also find that at 06:00-08:00 LT throughout the
   campaign, fresh traffic emissions result in substantial changes to the
   chemical distribution of the aerosol, with on average 65\% externally
   mixed fraction for 40 nm particles and 30\% externally mixed fraction
   for 100 nm particles, whereas at midday nearly all particles of both
   sizes can be described as ``internally mixed{''}. Average activation
   spectra and growth factor distributions are analyzed for different time
   periods characterizing the daytime (with and without NPF events), the
   early morning ``rush hour{''} and the entire campaign. We show that
   kappa{*} derived from CCNc measurements decreases as a function of size
   during all time periods, while the CCN-active fraction increases as a
   function of size. Size-resolved AMS measurements do not predict the
   observed trend for kappa{*} versus particle size, which can be
   attributed to unresolved mixing state and the presence of refractory
   material not measured by the AMS. Measured kappa{*} typically ranges
   from 0.2 to 0.35, and organics typically make up 60-85\% of the aerosol
   mass in the size range studied. We show that kappa(AMS) is able to
   describe CCN concentrations reasonably well, provided mixing-state
   information is available, especially at the highest CCN concentrations.
   This is consistent with other CCN studies carried out in urban
   environments, and is partly due to the fact that the highest CCN
   concentrations occur during the daytime when the aerosol is internally
   mixed. During the early morning rush hour, however, failing to account
   for the aerosol mixing state results in systematic overestimation of CCN
   concentrations by as much as 50-100\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a microfluidic system enabling cell type
   classification based on continuous characterization of size-independent
   electrical properties (e.g., specific membrane capacitance (C-specific
   membrane) and cytoplasm conductivity (sigma(cytoplasm))). In this study,
   cells were aspirated continuously through a constriction channel, while
   cell elongation and impedance profiles at two frequencies (1 kHz and 100
   kHz) were measured simultaneously. Based on a proposed distributed
   equivalent circuit model, 1 kHz impedance data were used to evaluate
   cellular sealing properties with constriction channel walls and 100 kHz
   impedance data were translated to C-specific membrane and
   sigma(cytoplasm). Two lung cancer cell lines of CRL-5803 cells (n(cell)
   = 489) and CCL-185 cells (n(cell) = 487) were used to evaluate this
   technique, producing a C-specific membrane of 1.63 +/- 0.52 mu F cm(-2)
   vs. 2.00 +/- 0.60 mu F cm(-2), and sigma(cytoplasm) of 0.90 +/- 0.19 S
   m(-1) vs. 0.73 +/- 0.17 S m(-1). Neural network-based pattern
   recognition was used to classify CRL-5803 and CCL-185 cells, producing
   success rates of 65.4\% (C-specific membrane), 71.4\%
   (sigma(cytoplasm)), and 74.4\% (C-specific membrane and
   sigma(cytoplasm)), suggesting that these two tumor cell lines can be
   classified based on their electrical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane fouling plagues all types of membrane filtration, from
   large-pore microfiltration to nonporous reverse osmosis (RO). Here we
   investigate the feasibility of using a coating of one or two layers that
   serves as a barrier between the membrane and foulant. This coating is
   electrostatically bound to the membrane at operational pH and removed
   with a simple pH adjustment once fouling has reduced operational
   efficiency. The water treatment polymer polydiallyldimethylammonium
   chloride (polyDADMAC) was used to create a positive charge on the fully
   aromatic polyamide membrane surface. Carboxy-functionalized polyacrylate
   nanoparticles (NPs) composite with either silver {[}Ag-PA(-)] or
   titanium dioxide {[}TiO2-PA(-), both approximately 10 nm in size, were
   then adsorbed onto the polyDADMAC coating to reinstate an overall
   negative charge to the membrane surface. Acid washing removed the
   polyDADMAC coating by protonating the carboxyl groups on the membrane,
   promoting repulsion from the membrane surface. Coating and removal
   phases were characterized primarily by measurement of the surface zeta
   potential with an electrokinetic analyzer. Additional characterization
   was performed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and attenuated
   total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy.
   The overall results serve as a proof of concept that these materials
   could serve as removable coatings for RO membranes.}},

   Low Boiling Points}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{The titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysts were synthesized by a
   solvothermal process in highly alkaline 70 : 30 water : ketone solutions
   with a TiO2-P25 precursor and calcined at different temperatures. The
   ketone solvents, such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), had low
   boiling points (<100 degrees C). The as-prepared samples were
   characterized by XRD, TEM, FTIR, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy. The
   effects of the different solvents on the nanostructure, the morphology,
   and the photocatalytic performance of the TiO2 products were
   investigated. Nanotubes formed in water and water-MEK, while
   nanoparticle/nanowires formed in water acetone and water-acetone-MEK.
   The ketone solvents played an important role in the improving
   nanostructure properties of these products, which affected their
   photocatalytic reactions. The results indicated that samples synthesized
   in solvents such as water and MEK had high adsorption and photocatalytic
   behaviors. The photocatalytic reactivity was the greatest for the TiO2
   prepared in MEK and calcined at 100 degrees C, which was even more
   reactive than the sample prepared in water and TiO2-P25 powder.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on a simple and effective method for improving the
   electrochemical performance of silicon nanoparticle-core/carbon-shell
   (Si-core/C-shell) nanofibers. Instead of increasing the encapsulation
   amount of Si nanoparticles, additional conductive paths between the Si
   nanoparticles were formed by incorporating a small percentage of
   multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) (e. g., 5 wt\% with respect to Si)
   into the Si nanoparticle core. The electrical conductivity of a single
   Si-core/C-shell nanofiber was measured by a four-point probe using four
   nano-manipulators, which showed a more than five times increase
   according to MWNT addition. A galvanostatic charge-discharge test
   demonstrated that a small amount of MWNTs greatly improved the
   electrochemical performance of the Si-core/C-shell nanofibers (e. g., a
   25.1\% increase in the Li-ion storage capability) due to the enhanced
   participation of Si through the additional conductive paths formed
   between the Si nanoparticles.}},

   collapse}},
Journal = {{STRUCTURAL SAFETY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{41}},
Pages = {{119-133}},
Abstract = {{Although the influence of ground motion duration on liquefaction and
   slope stability is widely acknowledged, its influence on structural
   response is a topic of some debate. This study examines the effect of
   ground motion duration on the collapse of reinforced concrete structures
   by conducting incremental dynamic analysis on nonlinear
   multiple-degree-of-freedom models of concrete frame buildings with
   different structural properties. Generalized linear modeling regression
   techniques are used to predict the collapse capacity of a structure, and
   the duration of the ground motion is found to be a significant predictor
   of collapse resistance. As a result, the collapse risk of the analyzed
   buildings is higher on being subjected to longer duration ground
   motions, as compared to shorter duration ground motions having the same
   ground motion intensity. Ground motion duration affects the collapse
   capacity of highly deteriorating (non-ductile) and less deteriorating
   (ductile) concrete structures. Therefore, it is recommended to consider
   the duration of the ground motion in addition to its intensity and
   frequency content in structural design and assessment of seismic risk.

Abstract = {{Despite their small masses, comets have played an extraordinary role in
   enhancing our understanding of cosmic physics. It was the calculation of
   comet Halley's orbit and the successful prediction of its return in 1758
   that firmly established the correctness of Newton's law of universal
   gravitation. It was the morphology of the dusty tails of comets that
   provided the earliest information of the nature of the interaction of
   solar electromagnetic radiation with dust, and it was the orientation
   and structure of the plasma tails of comets that led to the discovery of
   the solar wind. More recently, the role of the changing dusty plasma
   environments of comets as natural space laboratories for the study of
   dust-plasma interactions, and their physical and dynamical consequences,
   has been recognized. The forthcoming Rosetta-Philae rendezvous and
   lander mission will provide a unique opportunity to revisit the entire
   range of earlier observations of dusty plasma phenomena in a single
   comet, as it moves around the Sun. In this topical review, motivated by
   the Rosetta mission, we discuss the varying modes of interaction of the
   comet as it approaches the Sun, and the different dusty plasma phenomena
   that are expected in each case, drawing on the earlier observations,
   including their interpretations and prevailing open questions.}},

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{We apply a full year of continuous atmospheric acetone measurements from
   the University of Minnesota tall tower Trace Gas Observatory (KCMP tall
   tower; 244 m a.g.l.), with a 0.5 degrees x 0.667 degrees GEOS-Chem
   nested grid simulation to develop quantitative new constraints on
   seasonal acetone sources over North America. Biogenic acetone emissions
   in the model are computed based on the MEGANv2.1 inventory. An inverse
   analysis of the tall tower observations implies a 37\% underestimate of
   emissions from broadleaf trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants, and an
   offsetting 40\% overestimate of emissions from needleleaf trees plus
   secondary production from biogenic precursors. The overall result is a
   small (16 \%) model underestimate of the total primary + secondary
   biogenic acetone source in North America. Our analysis shows that North
   American primary + secondary anthropogenic acetone sources in the model
   (based on the EPA NEI 2005 inventory) are accurate to within
   approximately 20 \%. An optimized GEOS-Chem simulation incorporating the
   above findings captures 70\% of the variance (R = 0.83) in the hourly
   measurements at the KCMP tall tower, with minimal bias. The resulting
   North American acetone source is 11 Tg a(-1), including both primary
   emissions (5.5 Tg a(-1)) and secondary production (5.5 Tg a(-1)), and
   with roughly equal contributions from anthropogenic and biogenic
   sources. The North American acetone source alone is nearly as large as
   the total continental volatile organic compound (VOC) source from fossil
   fuel combustion. Using our optimized source estimates as a baseline, we
   evaluate the sensitivity of atmospheric acetone and peroxyacetyl nitrate
   (PAN) to shifts in natural and anthropogenic acetone sources over North
   America. Increased biogenic acetone emissions due to surface warming are
   likely to provide a significant offset to any future decrease in
   anthropogenic acetone emissions, particularly during summer.}},

Abstract = {{The optical imaging depth in biological materials is limited by the
   scattering of light in tissue. New methods which control light
   propagation through scattering media have been introduced with the
   potential to overcome the scattering of light in biological materials.
   These techniques shape the incident wavefront to pre-compensate for the
   scattering effects of light propagation in the material and beyond.
   However, living biological materials have speckle decorrelation times on
   the millisecond timescale. This fast rate of change makes liquid crystal
   spatial light modulation (LC-SLM) devices too slow for this task. To
   achieve the required wavefront control with high modulation speeds we
   present binary-amplitude off-axis computer-generated holography
   implemented on a digital micro-mirror device (DMD). Binary amplitude
   off-axis holography is a method for the generation of arbitrary
   wavefronts, and in particular uniform-amplitude phase-modulated images.
   As a result, we are able to simultaneously encode phase modulated
   wavefronts at the high frame rate of binary amplitude DMDs. This
   wavefront encoding technique allows for focusing through temporally
   dynamic turbid materials at a rate which approaches the decorrelation
   time of living biological tissue. We demonstrate this technique by high
   speed wavefront optimization for focusing through turbid media as well
   as through a dynamic, strongly scattering sample with short speckle
   decorrelation times. With this approach we attain an order of magnitude
   improvement in measurement speed over the previous fastest wavefront
   determination method and three orders of magnitude improvement over
   LC-SLM methods.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the possible application of periodic orbit
   control maneuvers for so-called evolved-LISA (eLISA) missions, i.e.,
   missions for which the constellation arm lengths and mean distance from

   lengths of similar to 10(6) km and Earth-trailing distance ranging from
   similar to 12 degrees to 20 degrees over the science lifetime, the
   occasional use of the spacecraft micro-Newton thrusters for
   constellation configuration maintenance should be able to essentially
   eliminate constellation distortion caused by Earth-induced tidal forces
   at a cost to science time of only a few percent. With interior angle
   variation kept to similar to+/- 0.1 degrees, the required changes in the
   angles between the laser beam pointing directions for the two arms from
   any spacecraft could be kept quite small. This would considerably
   simplify the apparatus necessary for changing the transmitted beam

Abstract = {{Using a numerically modeled nonmonotonic potential profile plasma
   sheath, we identify the equilibrium height and charge of levitating dust
   particles for nanometer to 10 mu m sized particles over a five order of
   magnitude variation in the gravity of an airless central body. The
   stability and time scales of the dust particle motion about the
   equilibria are computed. The range of initial velocities that results in
   levitation of a dust particle is dominated by the particle size and is
   relatively insensitive to the mass of the central body and the
   particle's charge. By studying the dynamics of levitating dust
   particles, we are able to move beyond the point solutions that have been
   previously considered. This work enables more complete evaluations of
   the importance of dust levitation in the evolution of airless bodies and
   the hazard that levitating dust particles pose to exploration vehicles.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a case study of the day-to-day variability in the
   midlatitude upper atmospheric ion temperature (similar to 200-400 km)
   with a focus on variability resulting from meteorological forcing. The
   data are obtained by the Millstone Hill incoherent scatter radar (42.6
   degrees N, 288.5 degrees E) on 18-31 January 2010, in coincidence with a
   major sudden stratospheric warming. We elucidate oscillations in ion
   temperature with both tidal periods (similar to 8 h and similar to 12 h)
   and non-tidal periods (>24 h) by analyzing residuals between the
   observed temperatures and those expected from an empirical model. We
   present the spatial-temporal development of periodicities in ion
   temperature and discuss to what degree these periodicities might be
   related to the sudden stratospheric warming event. The spectral location
   and temporal evolution of periodicities with similar to 9.9-12.9 h and
   similar to 6.2-7.9 h suggest that they are related to the semidiurnal
   (12 h) and terdiurnal (8 h) tides that are enhanced during the sudden
   stratospheric warming. Periodicities with similar to 3-4d and similar to
   10-13 d are likely related to Rossby waves with 4 d and 10 d periods,
   while the strong periodicity observed at 16-17 h could result from the
   nonlinear interaction of the quasi 2 d wave with the semidiurnal tide.
   As planetary waves are not expected to propagate to altitudes of similar
   to 200-250 km, these experimental results raise questions about the
   potential mechanisms of coupling between the lower and upper atmosphere.

Title = {{Top-down estimate of surface flux in the Los Angeles Basin using a
   mesoscale inverse modeling technique: assessing anthropogenic emissions
   of CO, NOx and CO2 and their impacts}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{3661-3677}},
Abstract = {{We present top-down estimates of anthropogenic CO, NOx and CO2 surface
   fluxes at mesoscale using a Lagrangian model in combination with three
   different WRF model configurations, driven by data from aircraft flights
   during the CALNEX campaign in southern California in May-June 2010. The
   US EPA National Emission Inventory 2005 (NEI 2005) was the prior in the
   CO and NOx inversion calculations. The flux ratio inversion method,
   based on linear relationships between chemical species, was used to
   calculate the CO2 inventory without prior knowledge of CO2 surface
   fluxes. The inversion was applied to each flight to estimate the
   variability of single-flight-based flux estimates. In Los Angeles (LA)
   County, the uncertainties on CO and NOx fluxes were 10\% and 15 \%,
   respectively. Compared with NEI 2005, the CO posterior emissions were
   lower by 43\% in LA County and by 37\% in the South Coast Air Basin
   (SoCAB). NOx posterior emissions were lower by 32\% in LA County and by
   27\% in the SoCAB. NOx posterior emissions were 40\% lower on weekends
   relative to weekdays. The CO2 posterior estimates were 183 Tgyr(-1) in
   SoCAB. A flight during ITCT (Intercontinental Transport and Chemical
   Transformation) in 2002 was used to estimate emissions in the LA Basin
   in 2002. From 2002 to 2010, the CO and NOx posterior emissions decreased
   by 41\% and 37\%, respectively, in agreement with previous studies. Over
   the same time period, CO2 emissions increased by 10\% in LA County but
   decreased by 4\% in the SoCAB, a statistically insignificant change.
   Overall, the posterior estimates were in good agreement with the
   California Air Resources Board (CARB) inventory, with differences of
   15\% or less. However, the posterior spatial distribution in the basin
   was significantly different from CARB for NOx emissions. WRF-Chem
   mesoscale chemical-transport model simulations allowed an evaluation of
   differences in chemistry using different inventory assumptions,
   including NEI 2005, a gridded CARB inventory and the posterior
   inventories derived in this study. The biases in WRF-Chem ozone were
   reduced and correlations were increased using the posterior from this
   study compared with simulations with the two bottom-up inventories,
   suggesting that improving the spatial distribution of ozone precursor
   surface emissions is also important in mesoscale chemistry simulations.}},

Journal = {{MARINE ECOLOGY PROGRESS SERIES}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{47-62}},
Abstract = {{Fouling communities living on hard surfaces in harbors are model systems
   for studying larval recruitment and ecological succession. Although they
   live in protected harbors, fouling communities are exposed to waves due
   to wind chop and ship wakes. We studied how superimposing waves onto
   unidirectional currents affects hydrodynamic stresses experienced by
   larvae settling into different microhabitats within rugose fouling
   communities. We exposed fouled plates in a flume to turbulent water
   currents and waves mimicking those measured across fouling communities
   in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, USA, and used laser-Doppler velocimetry to
   measure water velocities on the scale of larvae (500 mu m from surfaces)
   at specific positions within each community chosen to represent a wide
   range of microhabitat types. These data were used to determine
   instantaneous hydrodynamic stresses encountered by larvae and to
   calculate larval settlement probabilities. Local topography was more
   important than successional stage in determining hydro dynamic stresses
   on the scale of larvae. Increasing current velocity reduced settlement
   probabilities, with the largest effects on a flat unfouled surface and
   on microhabitats on the tops of fouling organisms. Wind chop and ship
   wakes reduced the probability of larval settlement at all current speeds
   and in all microhabitats, with the most pronounced effects on sites atop
   fouling organisms. Episodic peak stresses can be orders of magnitude
   higher than mean stresses, so using instantaneous stresses to calculate
   settlement probability yields a lower value than is predicted using mean
   stress. The factor by which the use of mean stress over-estimates
   settlement probability depends on both microhabitat and flow conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Experiments in a dilute, gas-solids circulating fluidized bed have been
   conducted, with an emphasis on the impact of polydispersity on
   elutriation and species segregation. Two categories of polydispersity
   were studied: binary mixtures with various compositions and continuous
   particle size distributions (PSDs) with various widths. Qualitative
   differences between the two include (i) total elutriation flux of binary
   mixtures increases with the composition of fines (U-t < U-s) but not so
   for continuous PSDs and (ii) elutriation flux of coarse particles (U-t >
   U-s) depends non-monotonically on fines composition for binary mixtures
   but monotonically for continuous PSDs. These differences are explained
   by the increasing size disparity of continuous PSDs as distribution
   width increases, while the size disparity remains constant in binary
   mixtures of varying compositions. A third qualitative difference is the
   monotonic decrease in mass \% of coarse particles with riser height
   observed for continuous PSDs, and a nonmonotonic behavior for binary
   mixtures. (C) 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J, 59:

   temperatures and climate in the region. The effect of anthropogenic
   sources of aerosol particles on the stratocumulus deck was investigated
   during the VOCALS field experiment. Aerosol measurements below and above
   cloud were made with a ultra-high sensitivity aerosol spectrometer and
   analytical electron microscopy. In addition to more standard in-cloud
   measurements, droplets were collected and evaporated using a counterflow
   virtual impactor (CVI), and the non-volatile residual particles were
   analyzed.
   Many flights focused on the gradient in cloud properties on an E-W track
   along 20 degrees S from near the Chilean coast to remote areas offshore.
   Mean statistics, including their significance, from eight flights and
   many individual legs were compiled. Consistent with a continental source
   of cloud condensation nuclei, below-cloud accumulation-mode aerosol and
   droplet number concentration generally decreased from near shore to
   offshore. Single particle analysis was used to reveal types and sources
   of the enhanced particle number that influence droplet concentration.
   While a variety of particle types were found throughout the region, the
   dominant particles near shore were partially neutralized sulfates.
   Modeling and chemical analysis indicated that the predominant source of
   these particles in the marine boundary layer along 20 degrees S was
   anthropogenic pollution from central Chilean sources, with copper
   smelters a relatively small contribution.
   Cloud droplets were smaller in regions of enhanced particles near shore.
   However, physically thinner clouds, and not just higher droplet number
   concentrations from pollution, both contributed to the smaller droplets.
   Satellite measurements were used to show that cloud albedo was highest
   500-1000 km offshore, and actually slightly lower closer to shore due to
   the generally thinner clouds and lower liquid water paths there. Thus,
   larger scale forcings that impact cloud macrophysical properties, as
   well as enhanced aerosol particles, are important in determining cloud
   droplet size and cloud albedo.
   Differences in the size distribution of droplet residual particles and
   ambient aerosol particles were observed. By progressively excluding
   small droplets from the CVI sample, we were able to show that the larger
   drops, some of which may initiate drizzle, contain the largest aerosol
   particles. Geometric mean diameters of droplet residual particles were
   larger than those of the below-cloud and above cloud distributions.
   However, a wide range of particle sizes can act as droplet nuclei in
   these stratocumulus clouds. A detailed LES microphysical model was used
   to show that this can occur without invoking differences in chemical
   composition of cloud-nucleating particles.}},

Abstract = {{The NASA DC-8 aircraft characterized the aerosol properties, chemical
   composition, and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations of the
   summertime Arctic during the 2008 NASA Arctic Research of the
   Composition of the Troposphere from Aircraft and Satellites (ARC-TAS)
   campaign. Air masses characteristic of fresh and aged biomass burning,
   boreal forest, Arctic background, and anthropogenic industrial pollution
   were sampled. Observations were spatially extensive (50-85 degrees N and
   40-130 degrees W) and exhibit significant variability in aerosol and CCN
   concentrations. The chemical composition was dominated by highly
   oxidized organics (66-94\% by volume), with a water-soluble mass
   fraction of more than 50 \%. The aerosol hygroscopicity parameter,
   kappa, ranged between kappa = 0.08-0.32 for all air mass types.
   Industrial pollution had the lowest kappa of 0.08 +/- 0.01, while the
   Arctic background had the highest and most variable kappa of 0.32 +/-
   0.21, resulting from a lower and more variable organic fraction. Both
   fresh and aged (long-range transported) biomass burning air masses
   exhibited remarkably similar kappa (0.18 +/- 0.13), consistent with
   observed rapid chemical and physical aging of smoke emissions in the
   atmosphere, even in the vicinity of fresh fires. The organic
   hygroscopicity (kappa(org)) was parameterized by the volume fraction of
   water-soluble organic matter (epsilon(WSOM)), with a kappa = 0.12, such
   that kappa(org) = 0.12 `` WSOM. Assuming bulk (size-independent)
   composition and including the kappa(org) parameterization enabled CCN
   predictions to within 30\% accuracy for nearly all environments sampled.
   The only exception was for industrial pollution from Canadian oil sands
   exploration, where an external mixture and size-dependent composition
   was required. Aerosol mixing state assumptions (internal vs. external)
   in all other environments did not significantly affect CCN predictions;
   however, the external mixing assumption provided the best results, even
   though the available observations could not determine the true degree of
   external mixing and therefore may not always be representative of the
   environments sampled. No correlation was observed between kappa(org) and
   O: C. A novel correction of the CCN instrument supersaturation for water
   vapor depletion, resulting from high concentrations of CCN, was also
   employed. This correction was especially important for fresh biomass
   burning plumes where concentrations exceeded 1.5x10(4) cm(-3) and
   introduced supersaturation depletions of >= 25 \%. Not accounting for
   supersaturation depletion in these high concentration environments would
   therefore bias CCN closure up to 25\% and inferred kappa by up to 50 \%.}},

   temperature-dependent bond exchange reactions}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{4083-4096}},
Abstract = {{We study a class of polymers with bond exchange reactions that can
   rearrange the polymer network topology while maintaining the network
   integrity. Examples include the recently developed epoxy-acid network
   with transesterification reaction and polybutadiene polymer with olefin
   metathesis reaction. This class of polymers, although covalently
   crosslinked and thus insoluble, are rendered malleable through
   viscoelastic flow caused by the bond exchange reactions. The reaction
   also facilitates unique and technologically important behavior such as
   self-healing, thermoforming, and recyclability. Here we develop a
   thermodynamically consistent continuum model to describe the coupling
   between the macroscopic thermo-mechanics and the microscopic
   network-altering chemical reactions. Our basic approach is to decompose
   the network into groups of chains that are reformed at different times
   during the loading history; at any instant the network strain energy is
   obtained by summing the contributions from all chains. Evolution of the
   chain composition, determined by the temperature-dependent chemical
   reaction kinetics, changes the total strain energy and leads to
   macroscopic relaxation. Our model is applicable to general
   three-dimensional finite deformation with arbitrary thermal and
   mechanical boundary conditions. In the case of isothermal processes,
   only four material parameters are required: two describing the
   mechanical behavior and two describing the chemical kinetics. Using the
   epoxy-acid network as an example, we show that our model captures the
   key features of recently reported experiments. An important feature of
   these materials is that they can be processed like a thermoplastic,
   while retaining the appealing properties of a thermoset. Specifically,
   one can deform the material and then heat it to relax stresses, after
   which it will maintain its deformed shape, although there may be some
   elastic springback. To this end, we use our model to derive simple
   analytical estimates for a fixity parameter, defined as the ratio of the
   permanent deformation after the thermomechanical process to the
   prescribed deformation. We also implement our model in a 3D nonlinear
   finite element code and use it to study two representative thermoforming
   examples: twisting of a strip and indentation of a substrate. We extract
   the fixity parameter from the finite element results and show that our
   analytical estimates provide a reasonable approximation.}},

   formation of skin layers and microspheres}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{17}},
Pages = {{4455-4463}},
Abstract = {{We report the structure formation of films obtained via
   photocrosslinking of precursors during the evaporation of solvents.
   Although most precursor/solvent systems result in uniform dense films
   after the process, reaction-induced phase separation can occur in
   solvents with a unique combination of solubility, evaporation rate and
   ratio of latent heat to heat capacity. Most significantly, for such
   solvents, the forced convective evaporation under controlled N-2 flow
   results in a highly hierarchical film morphology, featuring a skin layer
   on top of a layer of microspheres formed via a nucleation and growth
   mechanism. For the first time, the skin layer formed during the
   evaporation was directly observed after the complete evaporation of the
   solvent. The thickness of the skin layer is dependent on the processing
   parameters including the N-2 flow rate, UV intensity and precursor
   concentrations. The skin layer formation could be suppressed by addition
   of non-solvent, in which case the characteristic morphology resulted
   from dominant spinodal decomposition. A model is presented that can
   qualitatively describe the skin layer formation and its dependence on
   the processing parameters, providing a mechanistic understanding of the
   photocrosslinking-induced phase separation under evaporative
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Earth science satellite missions currently require orbit determination
   solutions with position accuracies to within a centimeter. The
   estimation of empirical accelerations has become commonplace in precise
   orbit determination for Earth-orbiting satellites. Dynamic model
   compensation uses an exponentially time-correlated system noise process,
   known as a first-order Gauss-Markov process, to estimate unmodeled
   accelerations. In this work, the use of a second-order Gauss-Markov
   process is addressed to compensate for higher order spherical harmonic
   gravity accelerations, beyond J(3). Improvements in precise orbit
   determination and orbit prediction through the implementation of an
   optimal second-order Gauss-Markov process for empirical acceleration
   estimation are assessed. The use of a single well-calibrated
   second-order Gauss-Markov process outperforms a first-order Gauss-Markov
   process and a poorly calibrated second-order Gauss-Markov process for
   both continuous observations and poor tracking data.}},

   measurements from 50 sites reported in the US EPA Air Quality System
   (AQS) and two state agencies. We found that the observed PM10-2.5
   concentrations show significant spatial variability and distinct spatial
   patterns, associated with the distributions of land use/land cover and
   soil moisture. The highest concentrations were observed in the
   southwestern US, where sparse vegetation, shrublands or barren lands
   dominate with lower soil moistures, whereas the lowest concentrations
   were observed in areas dominated by grasslands, forest, or croplands
   with higher surface soil moistures. The observed PM10-2.5 concentrations
   also show variable seasonal, weekly, and diurnal patterns, indicating a
   variety of sources and their relative importance at different locations.
   The observed results were compared to modeled PM10-2.5 concentrations
   from an annual simulation using the Community Multiscale Air Quality
   modeling system (CMAQ) that has been designed for regulatory or policy
   assessments of a variety of pollutants including PM10, which consists of
   PM10-2.5 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). The model under-predicts
   PM10-2.5 observations at 49 of 50 sites, among which 14 sites have
   annual observation means that are at least five times greater than model
   means. Model results also fail to reproduce their spatial patterns.
   Important sources (e. g. pollen, bacteria, fungal spores, and geogenic
   dust) were not included in the emission inventory used and/or the
   applied emissions were greatly under-estimated. Unlike the observed
   patterns that are more complex, modeled PM10-2.5 concentrations show the
   similar seasonal, weekly, and diurnal pattern; the temporal allocations
   in the modeling system need improvement. CMAQ does not include organic
   materials in PM10-2.5; however, speciation measurements show that
   organics constitute a significant component. The results improve our
   understanding of sources and behavior of PM10-2.5 and suggest avenues
   for future improvements to models that simulate PM10-2.5 emissions,
   transport and fate.}},

Abstract = {{temperature steam gasification/reforming of biomass-methane mixtures was
   carried out in an indirectly heated entrained flow reactor to analyze
   the feasibility of controlling the output composition of the major
   synthesis gas products: H-2, CO, CO2, CH4. A 2(3) factorial experimental
   design was carried out and compared to thermodynamic equilibrium
   predictions. Experiments demonstrated the product gas composition is
   mostly dependent on temperature and that excess steam contributes to CO2
   formation. Results showed that with two carbon-containing reactants it
   is possible to control the gas composition of the major products. At
   1500 degrees C, the equilibrium results accurately predicted the syngas
   composition and can be used to guide optimization of the syngas for
   downstream liquid fuel synthesis technologies. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{A quantitative x-ray diffraction inventory of volcaniclastic inputs into
   the marine sediment archives off Iceland: a contribution to the
   Volcanoes in the Arctic System programme}},
Journal = {{POLAR RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{32}},
Abstract = {{This paper re-evaluates how well quantitative x-ray diffraction (qXRD)
   can be used as an exploratory method of the weight percentage (wt\%) of
   volcaniclastic sediment, and to identify tephra events in marine cores.
   In the widely used RockJock v6 software programme, qXRD tephra and glass
   standards include the rhyodacite White River tephra (Alaska), a
   rhyolitic tephra (Hekla-4) and the basaltic Saksunarvatn tephra.
   Experiments of adding known wt\% of tephra to felsic bedrock samples
   indicated that additions >= 10 wt\% are accurately detected, but
   reliable estimates of lesser amounts are masked by amorphous material
   produced by milling. Volcaniclastic inputs range between 20 and 50 wt\%.
   Primary tephra events are identified as peaks in residual qXRD glass
   wt\% from fourth-order polynomial fits. In cores where tephras have been
   identified by shard counts in the >150 mu m fraction, there is a
   positive correlation (validation) with peaks in the wt\% glass estimated
   by qXRD. Geochemistry of tephra shards confirms the presence of several
   Hekla-sourced tephras in cores B997-317PC1 and -319PC2 on the northern
   Iceland shelf. In core B997-338 (north-west Iceland), there are two
   rhyolitic tephras separated by ca. 100 cm with uncorrected radiocarbon
   dates on articulated shells of around 13 000 yr B. P. These tephras may
   be correlatives of the Borrobol and Penifiler tephras found in Scotland.
   The number of Holocene tephra events per 1000 yr was estimated from qXRD
   on 16 cores and showed a bimodal distribution with an increased number
   of events in both the late and early Holocene.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing the integral expression of Coulomb's Law to determine the
   electric potential from a continuous charge distribution is a canonical
   exercise in Electricity and Magnetism (E\&M). In this study, we use both
   think-aloud interviews and responses to traditional exam questions to
   investigate student difficulties with this topic at the upper-division
   level. Leveraging a theoretical framework for the use of mathematics in
   physics, we discuss how students activate, construct, execute and
   reflect on the integral form of Coulomb's Law when solving problems with
   continuous charge distributions. We present evidence that junior-level
   E\&M students have difficulty mapping physical systems onto the
   mathematical expression for the Coulomb potential. Common challenges
   include difficulty expressing the difference vector in appropriate
   coordinates as well as determining expressions for the differential
   charge element and limits of integration for a specific charge
   distribution. We discuss possible implications of these findings for
   future research directions and instructional strategies.}},

   variability, trends, and association with ozone pollution}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{565-578}},
Abstract = {{Prior work indicates that the frequency of summertime mid-latitude
   cyclones tracking across the Great Lakes Storm Track (GLST, bounded by:
   70 degrees W, 90 degrees W, 40 degrees N, and 50 degrees N) are strongly
   anticorrelated with ozone (O-3) pollution episodes over the Northeastern
   United States (US). We apply the MAP Climatology of Mid-latitude
   Storminess (MCMS) algorithm to 6-hourly sea level pressure fields from
   over 2500 yr of simulations with the GFDL CM3 global coupled
   chemistry-climate model. These simulations include (1) 875 yr with
   constant 1860 emissions and forcings (Pre-industrial Control), (2) five
   ensemble members for 18602005 emissions and forcings (Historical), and
   (3) future (2006-2100) scenarios following the Representative
   Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) and a sensitivity
   simulation to isolate the role of climate warming from changes in O-3
   precursor emissions (RCP 4.5{*}). The GFDL CM3 Historical simulations
   capture the mean and variability of summertime cyclones traversing the
   GLST within the range determined from four reanalysis datasets. Over the
   21st century (2006-2100), the frequency of summertime mid-latitude
   cyclones in the GLST decreases under the RCP 8.5 scenario and in the RCP
   4.5 ensemble mean. These trends are significant when assessed relative
   to the variability in the Pre-industrial Control simulation. In
   addition, the RCP 4.5{*} scenario enables us to determine the
   relationship between summertime GLST cyclones and high-O-3 events (>
   95th percentile) in the absence of emission changes. The summertime GLST
   cyclone frequency explains less than 10\% of the variability in high-O-3
   events over the Northeastern US in the model, implying that other
   factors play an equally important role in determining high-O-3 events.}},

Abstract = {{Inspired by the setal microstructure found on the gecko's toe-pads, a
   highly dense array of high-aspect-ratio (HAR) artificial setae has been
   developed with a novel mold-casting technique using a porous silicon
   (PSi) template. To overcome the high fluid resistance in the HAR
   capillary pores, the PSi template surface is modified with a monolayer
   coating of dimethylsilane. The coating exhibits similar chemical
   composition and surface energy to the precursor of the
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) replica. The compatibility between the
   template and the replica addresses the major challenge of molding HAR
   microstructures, resulting in high-resolution replicas of artificial
   PDMS microsetae with complicated geometry resembling a real gecko's
   setae. The artificial setae are characterized by a mean radius of 1.3 mu
   m, an aspect ratio of 35.1, and a density of similar to 4.7 x 10(5) per
   mm(2). Results from adhesion characterizations reveal that with
   increasing preload, the shear adhesion of micro-setae continually
   increases while the normal adhesion decreases. The unique adhesion
   performance is caused by both van der Waals forces and the elastic
   resistance of PDMS setae. With further structural optimizations and the
   addition of an actuation mechanism, artificial setal arrays might
   eventually demonstrate the fascinating adhesion performances of the
   gecko for mimetic devices such as wall-climbing devices.}},

Abstract = {{In this study the structural deployment dynamics of a rollable micro air
   vehicle wing are investigated. The wing is composed of a single layer of
   woven, carbon-fiber composite and behaves like a tape-spring, remaining
   stiff in one direction (lift) while rolling easily in the other for
   storage. A finite element model is developed and evaluated for its
   comparison to an experimental model. A vacuum chamber is used to
   eliminate fluid effects on the structural deployment dynamics, which are
   recorded using a high-speed video camera. Modal testing and finite
   element updating are used to estimate unknown composite material
   properties for the analysis. A laser vibrometer is used to record wing
   mode shapes, and they are found to agree well with fitted mode shapes
   and their frequencies from the updated Abaqus finite element model. A
   wing deployment is simulated in Abaqus and compared with experimental
   deployments, and the time history displacements matched well. The
   deployment is found to be sensitive to the wing mount as well as to
   material properties, particularly damping.}},

Title = {{Computational investigation of defect segregation at the (001) surface

   controlling vacancy segregation}},

Abstract = {{The low proton grain boundary conductivity observed in perovskites such
   as BaZrO3 is generally attributed to a positive grain boundary core
   charge that repels protonic defects away from the interfacial region.
   This core charge develops from the segregation of positively charged
   defects to the grain boundary interface. Here, the results of a density
   function theory investigation of defect segregation at two (001)
   surfaces of BaCeO3 and BaZrO3 perovskites are presented that give
   insight into this phenomenon. Yttrium dopant and oxygen vacancy
   segregation were explored independently and synergistically at these
   simplified perovskite-vacuum interfaces in order to establish the
   enthalpic driving forces that promote defect segregation at different
   surfaces caused by intrinsic material properties. It was found that
   dopant segregation strongly influences the stability of oxygen vacancies
   at the perovskite surface because of favorable pairing between dopants
   and vacancies. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that selecting
   materials on the basis of metal-oxygen bond strengths offers a potential
   means of engineering perovskites to mitigate the development of a strong
   positively charged grain boundary core.}},

Abstract = {{We present orientation dependence and tuning of Fano resonances in
   plasmonic gold nanorod heptamer nanostructures. The heptamer structures
   were formed by surrounding a central circular nanoparticle by six
   satellite nanorods in a hexagonal arrangement and the heptamer
   structures were then embedded in a thin flexible membrane. The Fano
   resonance was found to depend on the orientation of the nanorods within
   the heptamer and for a given orientation, the Fano resonance was
   dynamically tuned and its symmetry lowered by application of uniaxial
   mechanical stress. The expected spectral features were obtained by
   simulations and verified by experiments. The spectral features of the
   heptamer structures were further characterized by using detailed group
   theoretical analysis. We show that both sub-structural and mechanical
   tuning could be employed to engineer the Fano resonances in complex
   plasmonic molecules.}},

Abstract = {{The use of electrostatic (Coulomb) actuation for formation flying is
   attractive because non-renewable fuel reserves are not depleted and
   plume impingement issues are avoided. Prior analytical electrostatic
   force models used for Coulomb formations assume spherical spacecraft
   shapes, which include mutual capacitance and induced effects. However,
   this framework does not capture any orientation-dependent forces or
   torques on generic spacecraft geometries encountered during very close
   operations and docking scenarios. The Multi-Sphere Method (MSM) uses a
   collection of finite spheres to represent a complex shape and
   analytically approximate the Coulomb interaction with other charged
   bodies. Finite element analysis software is used as a truth model to
   determine the optimal sphere locations and radii. The model is robust to
   varying system parameters such as prescribed voltages and external shape
   size. Using the MSM, faster-than-realtime electrostatic simulation of
   six degree of freedom relative spacecraft motion is feasible, which is
   crucial for the development of robust relative position and orientation
   control algorithms in local space situational awareness applications. To
   demonstrate this ability, the rotation of a cylindrical craft in deep
   space is simulated, while charge control from a neighboring spacecraft
   is used to de-spin the object. Using a 1 m diameter craft separated by
   10 m from a 3 by 1 m cylindrical craft in deep space, a 2 deg/s initial
   rotation rate can be removed from the cylinder within 3 days, using
   electric potentials up to 30 kV. (c) 2012 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the effectiveness of using active electrostatic
   charging to perform orbit altitude adjustments of a nominally circular
   orbit. Coulomb forces are employed to gently pull a charged object, such
   as space debris or a satellite being repositioned, in the along-track
   direction. In contrast to prior work, this study uses an enhanced
   position-dependent electrostatic force model. The charge at a fixed
   absolute potential is a function of separation distance, size, and
   charge of the neighboring object. The pulling configuration at a given
   voltage is shown to provide larger electrostatic forces over a pushing
   configuration. Further, the pulling configuration provides relative
   dynamics that are easier to stabilize. Variational equations are
   employed to estimate the resulting semimajor axis changes. Numerical
   sweeps are performed illustrating that kilovolt levels of potential are
   sufficient to achieve kilometer-level radius changes per orbit for
   geosynchronous orbit regimes. A key new insight is that, with a linear
   mass to effective radius scaling of the tugged object, a critical mass
   always exists beyond which the increased capacitance dominates over the
   mass increase. As a result, using the electrostatic tractor on a
   multiton geosynchronous orbit object can become easier if the object is
   larger than this critical mass.}},

Month = {{JAN-FEB}},
Abstract = {{Al2O3 gas diffusion barriers grown directly on Ca films using atomic
   layer deposition (ALD) techniques were evaluated using several methods
   based on Ca oxidation. The Al2O3 ALD films were grown on Ca films at 120
   degrees C using trimethylaluminum and H2O as the reactants. The
   oxidation of the Ca films was then monitored versus time at 70 degrees C
   and similar to 28\% relative humidity either by measuring the electrical
   conductance of the Ca film or by recording the photographic image of the
   Ca film. In the photographic images, the Ca films revealed that the
   Al2O3 ALD films have a small number of pinhole defects that lead to Ca
   film oxidation areas that grow radially around the pinhole defect versus
   time. A burst of new oxidation areas also appeared suddenly at later
   times and grew radially versus time. This rapid ``blooming{''} may be
   related to another type of defect caused by water corrosion of the Al2O3
   ALD films. In the electrical conductance measurements, the conductance
   of the Ca film initially showed little change versus time. The
   conductance then dropped rapidly when the oxidation area in the
   photographic image was a noticeable fraction of the Ca film area. The
   conductance measurements yielded a water vapor transmission rate (WVTR)
   value of similar to 2 x 10(-2) g/(m(2) day) prior to the rapid reduction
   of the conductance. The photographic images of the Ca film were also
   analyzed to obtain a WVTR value assuming radial oxidation of the Ca film
   around defects. The WVTR values obtained from the electrical conductance
   and the photographic images were in approximate agreement and increased
   versus Ca film oxidation until the rapid blooming of new circular
   oxidation areas. The WVTR values are larger than previous measurements
   and may indicate that Al2O3 ALD films grown directly on Ca are less
   stable and degraded by Ca film oxidation. This study reveals that a
   range of WVTR values can be obtained from different variations of the Ca
   test depending on the extent of Ca film oxidation. (C) 2013 American

   geophysical parameters of the Earth's surface. GNSS-reflected signals,
   after being received and processed by the airborne or spaceborne
   receiver, are available as delay correlation waveforms or as
   delay-Doppler maps (DDMs). In the case of a rough ocean surface, those
   characteristics can be related to the rms of the L-band limited slopes
   of the surface waves and, from there, to the surface wind speed. The raw
   GNSS-reflected signal can be either processed in real time by the
   receiver or recorded and stored on board and postprocessed in a
   laboratory. The latter approach leveraging a software receiver allows
   more flexibility while processing the raw data. This work analyzes DDMs
   obtained as a result of processing of the data collected by the Global
   Positioning System (GPS) data logger/software receiver on board the
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Gulfstream-IV jet
   aircraft. Thereafter, the DDMs were used to retrieve surface wind speed
   employing several different metrics that characterize the DDM extent in
   the Doppler frequency-delay domain. In contrast to previous works in
   which winds have been retrieved by fitting the theoretically modeled
   curves into measured correlation waveforms, here, we do not rely on any
   model for the determination. Instead, the approach is based on a linear
   regression between DDM observables and the wind speeds obtained in
   simultaneous GPS dropsonde measurements.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of relevant gene targets for engineering a desired
   trait is a key step in combinatorial strain engineering. Here, we
   applied the multi-Scalar Analysis of Library Enrichments (SCALEs)
   approach to map ethanol tolerance onto 1,000,000 genomic-library clones
   in Escherichia coli. We assigned fitness scores to each of the similar
   to 4,300 genes in E. coli, and through follow-up confirmatory studies
   identified 9 novel genetic targets (12 genes total) that increase E.
   coli ethanol tolerance (up to 6-fold improved growth). These genetic
   targets are involved in the processes related to cell membrane
   composition, translation, serine biosynthesis, and transcription
   regulation. Transcriptional profiling of the ethanol stress response in
   5 of these ethanol-tolerant clones revealed a total of 700 genes with
   significantly altered expression (mapped to 615 significantly enriched
   gene ontology terms) across all five clones, with similar overall
   changes in global gene expression between two clone clusters. All
   ethanol-tolerant clones analyzed shared 6\% of the overexpressed genes
   and showed enrichment for transcription regulation-related GO terms.
   iTRAQ-based proteomic analysis of ethanol-tolerant strains identified
   upregulation of proteins related to ROS mitigation, fatty acid
   biosynthesis, and vitamin biosynthesis as compared to the parent
   strain's ethanol response. The approach we outline here will be useful
   for engineering a variety of other traits and further improvements in
   alcohol tolerance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

   towards the thiol-Michael addition reaction and polymerization}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1048-1055}},
Abstract = {{The reactivity, selectivity and kinetics of vinyl sulfones and acrylates
   in base and nucleophile-catalyzed thiol-Michael addition reactions were
   examined in detail in this study. The vinyl sulfones react selectively
   and more rapidly with thiols in the presence of acrylates, which was
   clearly indicated from reactions of hexanethiol (HT), ethyl vinyl
   sulfone (EVS) and hexyl acrylate (HA) at a molar ratio of 2 : 1 : 1. EVS
   reaches 100\% conversion with minimal consumption (<10\%) of HA, which
   demonstrates the high selectivity of vinyl sulfones over acrylates. The
   reaction rate of EVS with HT was approximately 7 times higher than that
   of HA. A detailed study of the kinetics of the nucleophile-catalyzed
   thiol-Michael addition reaction was carried out, and it was shown that
   the delay observed in the initial stages of the nucleophile-catalyzed
   thiol-Michael addition reaction is due to the relatively slow attack of
   the nucleophiles on the vinyl. The presence of protic species other than
   thiols in the reaction mixture has also been shown to significantly
   impede the reaction rate, and in extreme cases, has been shown to
   inhibit the Michael addition reaction. These results provided a better
   understanding of the conditions under which the thiol-Michael addition
   reaction can or cannot be considered as a click reaction. Finally, the
   high reaction selectivity of vinyl sulfones over acrylates via
   thiol-Michael addition reaction in ternary systems is used to control
   gelation behavior in crosslinked polymer networks formed by
   thiol-Michael addition reactions.}},

Title = {{Redox initiation of bulk thiol-ene polymerizations}},
Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1167-1175}},
Abstract = {{The unique formation-structure-property attributes and reaction behavior
   of the thiol-ene ``click{''} reaction have been explored extensively for
   photochemically and thermally initiated reactions but have been much
   less explored for redox initiation. Therefore, the objective of this
   work is to characterize fully the impact of the initiation system,
   monomer structure, degree of functionalization, and inhibitor level on
   the redox-mediated thiol-ene polymerization rate and behavior. Moreover,
   this study confirms the ability of redox initiation to achieve full
   conversion of desired thiol-ene ``click{''} products for small molecules
   in solution. For the multifunctional thiol-ene systems, polymerization
   rate was shown to be comparable to photo- and thermally initiated
   systems, but with the additional advantages of unlimited depth of cure
   and mild reaction conditions. Additionally, the network properties of
   the redox-initiated thiol-ene systems were on par with a photocured
   material formulated with identical monomers and radical initiating
   potential. Lastly, control over the polymerization rate and preceding
   induction period was garnered from the concentration of inhibitor
   included in the reaction mixture. The mechanism of action of quinone
   inhibition in redox-mediated thiol-ene polymerizations is shown to
   depend on both the presence of an aniline reducing agent and the
   concentration of inhibitor, with quinone concentrations in great excess
   of oxidizing agent concentrations actually leading to heightened
   polymerization rates when aniline is present.}},

Title = {{Mechanisms of triple-shape polymeric composites due to dual thermal
   transitions}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2212-2223}},
Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMPs) are a class of smart materials capable of
   fixing a temporary shape and recovering the permanent shape in response
   to environmental stimuli such as heat, electricity, irradiation,
   moisture, or magnetic field, among others. Recently, multi-shape SMPs,
   which are capable of fixing more than one temporary shape and recovering
   sequentially from one temporary shape to another and eventually to the
   permanent shape, have attracted increasing attention. In general, there
   are two approaches to achieve a multi-shape memory effect (m-SME): the
   first one requires the SMP to have a broad temperature range of
   thermomechanical transition, such as a broad glass transition. The
   second approach uses multiple transitions to achieve m-SME, most
   notably, using two distinct transition temperatures to obtain a
   triple-shape memory effect (t-SME). The recently reported approach for
   designing and fabricating triple-shape polymeric composites (TSPCs)
   provides a much larger degree of design flexibility by separately tuning
   the two functional components (matrix and fiber network) to achieve
   optimum control of properties. The triple-shape memory behavior
   demonstrated by a TSPC is studied in this paper. This composite is
   composed of an epoxy matrix, providing a rubber-glass transition to fix
   one temporary shape, and an interpenetrating crystallizable PCL fiber
   network providing the system the melt-crystal transition to fix a second
   temporary shape. A one-dimension (1D) model that combines
   viscoelasticity for amorphous shape memory polymers (the matrix) with a
   constitutive model for crystallizable shape memory polymers (the fiber
   network) is developed to describe t-SME. The model includes the WLF and
   Arrhenius equations to describe the glass transition of the matrix, and
   the kinetics of crystallization and melting of the fiber network. The
   assumption that the newly formed crystalline phase of the fiber network
   is initially in a stress-free state is used to model the mechanics of
   evolving crystallizable phases. Experiments including uniaxial tension,
   stress relaxation, and triple-shape memory testing were carried out for

Title = {{Coupling field and laboratory measurements to estimate the emission
   factors of identified and unidentified trace gases for prescribed fires}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{89-116}},
Abstract = {{An extensive program of experiments focused on biomass burning emissions
   began with a laboratory phase in which vegetative fuels commonly
   consumed in prescribed fires were collected in the southeastern and
   southwestern US and burned in a series of 71 fires at the US Forest
   Service Fire Sciences Laboratory in Missoula, Montana. The particulate
   matter (PM2.5) emissions were measured by gravimetric filter sampling
   with subsequent analysis for elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC),
   and 38 elements. The trace gas emissions were measured by an open-path
   Fourier transform infrared (OP-FTIR) spectrometer,
   proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTRMS), proton-transfer
   ion-trap mass spectrometry (PIT-MS), negative-ion proton-transfer
   chemical-ionization mass spectrometry (NI-PT-CIMS), and gas
   chromatography with MS detection (GC-MS). 204 trace gas species (mostly
   non-methane organic compounds (NMOC)) were identified and quantified
   with the above instruments. Many of the 182 species quantified by the
   GC-MS have rarely, if ever, been measured in smoke before. An additional
   153 significant peaks in the unit mass resolution mass spectra were
   quantified, but either could not be identified or most of the signal at
   that molecular mass was unaccounted for by identifiable species.
   In a second, ``field{''} phase of this program, airborne and
   ground-based measurements were made of the emissions from prescribed
   fires that were mostly located in the same land management units where
   the fuels for the lab fires were collected. A broad variety, but smaller
   number of species (21 trace gas species and PM2.5) was measured on 14
   fires in chaparral and oak savanna in the southwestern US, as well as
   pine forest understory in the southeastern US and Sierra Nevada
   mountains of California. The field measurements of emission factors (EF)
   are useful both for modeling and to examine the representativeness of
   our lab fire EF. The lab EF/field EF ratio for the pine understory fuels
   was not statistically different from one, on average. However, our lab
   EF for ``smoldering compounds{''} emitted from the semiarid shrubland
   fuels should likely be increased by a factor of similar to 2.7 to better
   represent field fires. Based on the lab/field comparison, we present
   emission factors for 357 pyrogenic species (including unidentified
   species) for 4 broad fuel types: pine understory, semiarid shrublands,
   coniferous canopy, and organic soil.
   To our knowledge this is the most comprehensive measurement of biomass
   burning emissions to date and it should enable improved representation
   of smoke composition in atmospheric models. The results support a recent
   estimate of global NMOC emissions from biomass burning that is much
   higher than widely used estimates and they provide important insights
   into the nature of smoke. 31-72\% of the mass of gas-phase NMOC species
   was attributed to species that we could not identify. These unidentified
   species are not represented in most models, but some provision should be
   made for the fact that they will react in the atmosphere. In addition,
   the total mass of gas-phase NMOC divided by the mass of co-emitted PM2.5
   averaged about three (range similar to 2.0-8.7). About 35-64\% of the
   NMOC were likely semivolatile or of intermediate volatility. Thus, the
   gas-phase NMOC represent a large reservoir of potential precursors for
   secondary formation of ozone and organic aerosol. For the single lab
   fire in organic soil about 28\% of the emitted carbon was present as
   gas-phase NMOC and similar to 72\% of the mass of these NMOC was
   unidentified, highlighting the need to learn more about the emissions
   from smoldering organic soils. The mass ratio of total NMOC to ``NOx as
   NO{''} ranged from 11 to 267, indicating that NOx-limited O-3 production
   would be common in evolving biomass burning plumes. The fuel consumption
   per unit area was 7.0 +/- 2.3 Mg ha(-1) and 7.7 +/- 3.7 Mg ha(-1) for
   pine-understory and semiarid shrubland prescribed fires, respectively.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{41-52}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Accurate measurements of snowpack are needed both by scientists to model
   climate and by water supply managers to predict/mitigate drought and
   flood conditions. Existing in situ snow sensors/networks lack the
   necessary spatial and temporal sensitivity. Satellite measurements
   currently assess snow cover rather than snow depth. Existing GPS
   networks are a potential source of new snow data for climate scientists
   and water managers which complements existing snow sensors.
   Geodetic-quality GPS networks often provide signal-to-noise ratio data
   that are sensitive to snow depth at scales of 1,000 m(2), a much larger
   area than for other in situ sensors. However, snow depth can only be
   estimated at GPS sites when the modulation frequency of multipath
   signals can be resolved. We use data from the EarthScope Plate Boundary
   Observatory to examine the potential for snow sensing in GPS networks.
   Examples are shown for successful and unsuccessful snow retrieval sites.
   In particular, GPS sites in forested regions typically cannot be used
   for snow sensing. Multiple-year time series of snow depth are estimated
   from GPS sites in the Rocky Mountains. Peak snow depths ranged from 0.4
   to 1.2 m. Comparisons with independent sensors show strong correlations
   between the GPS snow depth estimates and the timing of snowstorms in the
   region.}},

Journal = {{HVAC\&R RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{2-9}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{A shoot-out contest to determine loss coefficients using computational
   fluid dynamics modeling for two prescribed oval duct fittings has been
   conducted. The objectives of the contest were to determine if the
   computational fluid dynamics modeling can predict loss coefficient
   within 15\% accuracy without previous knowledge of experimental data.
   The main findings of the project showed that the trends of the pressure
   loss coefficients were predicted correctly, while the accuracy can be
   improved. None of the contestants could predict the pressure loss
   coefficients within 15\% of the measurements for all the tested cases.
   The prediction error varies significantly among the ten submissions
   (between 20\% in some entries and more than 80\% in most others). The
   reasons for this error may be attributed to several facts, including
   errors in the geometry, errors in the definitions of the duct fitting
   loss coefficients, random choice of turbulence model and near wall
   treatment, inappropriate modeling of wall roughness, different grid
   conversions, etc. This article presents an in-depth discussion of the
   potential influences of these factors. The article also reviews the
   computing requirements for such a prediction task and finds that the
   duct fitting flow can be simulated with acceptable computational time on
   a regular computing platform. Recommendations for future research are
   provided, including the need for and approaches to performing a
   systematic study to compare and improve computational fluid dynamics
   techniques that are capable of predicting flow in duct fittings and to
   further the whole duct system to within an accuracy of 15\% or better of
   measured loss coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{Recent experimental investigations demonstrated that by incorporating
   magnetic particles into shape memory polymer matrices, a fast and remote
   heating of materials and shape recovery could be achieved by exposing
   the shape memory polymer composite to an electromagnetic field. The
   particles served as internal mini-antennas to transform the
   electromagnetic energy to inductive Joule heat, and subsequently to
   initiate the recovery of shape memory polymers (SMPs). In this paper, a
   three-dimensional computational study was carried out to study the
   coupling between heat transfer from spherically shaped particles and
   heat-induced shape recovery of SMP composites. The influence of particle
   size, particle volume fraction, particle heating temperature and rate to
   the magnetically induced shape recovery behavior was studied. The
   results in this paper provided a meaningful guidance for further designs

Abstract = {{In this study, we report on the effect that an externally applied
   compressive stress has on the electrochemical performance of Si anodes.
   Using the compression of an all-solid-state cell as a convenient format
   for simulating volume confinement, the electrochemical performance of Si
   anodes as a function of externally applied compressive stress has been
   systematically investigated. We verify that the extent of Si lithiation
   is limited by confining the free volume expansion of nano-Si particles.
   Volume confinement of Si particles is manifested as an overpotential and
   results in a stable anode for lithium-ion batteries. These results are
   foundational and lead to the best understanding to date of the complex
   electrochemomechanics of a Si-based anode. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical

Abstract = {{Prior research has established that electrical contractors involved in
   the construction and maintenance of electrical transmission and
   distribution (T\&D) lines are at extremely high risk of electrocution.
   The result of inadvertent contact with T\&D lines often is death or
   severe injury that involves damage to internal organs, musculoskeletal
   disorders, neurological damages and severe burns. The Electrical Safety
   Foundation International has demonstrated that contact with overhead
   power lines has been the single largest cause of electrical fatalities
   over the last decade. To reduce this disproportionate injury rate,
   electrical contractors implement many strategies such as the use of
   rubber insulating equipment, and locking devices. Unfortunately, these
   strategies are often cost-prohibitive in certain construction and
   maintenance scenarios. Therefore, electrical contractors are faced with
   complex decisions that involve comparing the cost of injury prevention
   with the expected safety benefit. This paper presents research that
   objectively evaluated the risk associated with common T\&D construction
   tasks and the effectiveness of specific injury prevention techniques.
   The research team then developed a decision support framework that
   provides electrical contractors with objective safety and cost feedback
   given specific project characteristics. The results indicate that many
   of the effective strategies implemented to reduce T\&D electrical
   injuries are very costly (e.g., de-energizing lines). Consequently,
   under most conditions, the costs of injury prevention far outweigh the
   cost savings associated with the reduction of injury rates. The
   implication of these findings is that T\&D electrical contractors must
   highly value the non-monetary benefits of injury prevention in order to
   improve safety in their sector. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{One of the primary goals for tissue engineering is to induce new tissue
   formation by stimulating specific cell function. Human mesenchymal stem
   cells (hMSCs) are a particularly important cell type that has been
   widely studied for differentiation down the osteogenic (bone) lineage,
   and we recently found that simple phosphate functional groups
   incorporated into poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels could induce
   osteogenesis without using differentiation medium by unknown mechanisms.
   Here, we aimed to determine whether direct or indirect cell/materials
   interactions were responsible for directing hMSCs down the osteogenic
   lineage on phosphate (PO4)-functionalized PEG hydrogels. Our results
   indicated that serum components adsorbed onto PO4-PEG hydrogels from
   medium in a presoaking step were sufficient for attachment and spreading
   of hMSCs, even when seeded in serum-free conditions. Blocking antibodies
   for collagen and fibronectin (targeted to the hydrogel), as well as beta
   1 and beta 3 integrin blocking antibodies (targeted to the cells), each
   reduced attachment of hMSCs to PO4-PEG hydrogels, suggesting that
   integrin-mediated interactions between cells and adsorbed matrix
   components facilitate attachment and spreading. Outside-in signaling,
   and not merely shape change, was found to be required for osteogenesis,
   as alkaline phosphatase activity and expression of CBFA1, osteopontin
   and collagen-1 were each significantly down regulated upon inhibition of
   focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation even though the focal adhesion
   structure or cell shape was unchanged. Our results demonstrate that
   complex function (i.e. osteogenic differentiation) can be controlled
   using simple functionalization strategies, such as incorporation of PO4,
   but that the role of these materials may be due to more complex
   influences than has previously been appreciated. (C) 2012 Acta

   arterial stiffening is an important predictor of events in systemic and
   pulmonary hypertension, partly through its contribution to downstream
   vascular abnormalities. However, much remains undetermined regarding the
   mechanisms involved in the vascular changes induced by arterial
   stiffening. We therefore addressed the hypothesis that high pulsatility
   flow, caused by proximal arterial stiffening, induces downstream
   pulmonary artery endothelial cell (EC) dysfunction that in turn leads to
   phenotypic change of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). To test the hypothesis,
   we employed a model pulmonary circulation in which upstream compliance
   regulates the pulsatility of flow waves imposed onto a downstream
   vascular mimetic coculture composed of pulmonary ECs and SMCs. The
   effects of high pulsatility flow on SMCs were determined both in the
   presence and absence of ECs. In the presence of ECs, high pulsatility
   flow increased SMC size and expression of the contractile proteins,
   smooth muscle alpha-actin (SMA) and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain
   (SM-MHC), without affecting proliferation. In the absence of ECs, high
   pulsatility flow decreased SMC expression of SMA and SM-MHC, without
   affecting SMC size or proliferation. To identify the molecular signals
   involved in the EC-mediated SMC responses, mRNA and/or protein
   expression of vasoconstrictors {[}angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
   and endothelin (ET)-1], vasodilator (eNOS), and growth factor (TGF-beta
   1) in EC were examined. Results showed high pulsatility flow decreased
   eNOS and increased ACE, ET-1, and TGF-beta 1 expression. ACE inhibition
   with ramiprilat, ET-1 receptor inhibition with bosentan, and treatment
   with the vasodilator bradykinin prevented flow-induced, EC-dependent SMC
   changes. In conclusion, high pulsatility flow stimulated SMC hypertrophy
   and contractile protein expression by altering EC production of
   vasoactive mediators and cytokines, supporting the idea of a coupling
   between proximal vascular stiffening, flow pulsatility, and downstream
   vascular function.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-based hydrogels are promising in situ cell
   carriers for tissue engineering. However, their success in vivo will in
   part depend upon the foreign body reaction (FBR). This study tests the
   hypothesis that the FBR affects cells encapsulated within PEG hydrogels,
   and in turn influences the severity of the FBR. Fibroblasts were
   encapsulated within PEG hydrogels containing RGD to support cell
   attachment. Macrophages were seeded on top of cell-laden hydrogels to
   mimic in vivo macrophage interrogation and treated with
   lipopolysaccharide to induce an inflammatory phenotype. The presence of
   activated macrophages reduced fibroblast gene expression for
   extracellular matrix molecules and remodeling, but stimulated VEGF and
   IL-1 beta gene expression. Fibroblasts impacted macrophage phenotype
   leading to increased iNOS, IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha expressions.
   Syngeneic cell-laden and acellular hydrogels were also implanted
   subcutaneously into C57bl/6 mice for 2, 7 and 28 days. Encapsulated
   fibroblasts secreted collagen type I during the first week, but tissue
   deposition and cellularity decreased by 28 days. The presence of
   encapsulated fibroblasts led to greater acute inflammation, but did not
   influence the fibrotic response. In summary, this work emphasizes the
   importance of the host response in tissue engineering, and the
   potentially deleterious impact it may have on cell-laden synthetic
   scaffolds. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   10-layer depth profile of the GN mat. With this unprecedented coverage
   of long sequences from one environment, we confirm the mat is
   phylogenetically stratified, presumably corresponding to light and
   geochemical gradients throughout the depth of the mat. Previous shotgun
   metagenomic data from the same depth profile show the same stratified
   pattern and suggest that metagenome properties may be predictable from
   rRNA gene sequences. We verify previously identified novel lineages and
   identify new phylogenetic diversity at lower taxonomic levels, for
   example, thousands of operational taxonomic units at the family-genus
   levels differ considerably from known sequences. The new sequences
   populate parts of the bacterial phylogenetic tree that previously were
   poorly described, but indicate that any comprehensive survey of GN
   diversity has only begun. Finally, we show that taxonomic conclusions
   are generally congruent between Sanger and 454 sequencing technologies,
   with the taxonomic resolution achieved dependent on the abundance of
   reference sequences in the relevant region of the rRNA tree of life. The

Abstract = {{Selecting an appropriate design-builder is critical to the success of
   design-build (DB) projects. The objective of this study is to identify
   selection criteria for design-builders and compare their relative
   importance by means of a robust content analysis of 94 requests for
   proposal (RFPs) for public DB projects. These DB projects had an
   aggregate contract value of over US\$3.5 billion and were advertised
   between 2000 and 2010. This study summarized twenty-six selection
   criteria and classified them into ten categories, i.e., price,
   experience, technical approach, management approach, qualification,
   schedule, past performance, financial capability, responsiveness to the
   RFP, and legal status, in descending order of their relative importance.
   The results showed that although price still remains the most important
   selection category, its relative importance has declined significantly
   in the last decade. The categories of qualification, experience, and
   past performance, by contrast, have become more important to DB owners
   for selecting design-builders. Finally, it is found that the importance
   weighting of price in large projects is significantly higher than that
   in small projects. This study provides a useful reference for owners in
   selecting their preferred design-builders. DOI:

Abstract = {{Bending rigidity and Gaussian bending stiffness are the two key
   parameters that govern the rippling of suspended graphene-an unavoidable
   phenomenon of two-dimensional materials when subject to a thermal or
   mechanical field. A reliable determination about these two parameters is
   of significance for both the design and the manipulation of graphene
   morphology for engineering applications. By combining the density
   functional theory calculations of energies of fullerenes and single wall
   carbon nanotubes with the configurational energy of membranes determined
   by Helfrich Hamiltonian, we have designed a theoretical approach to
   accurately determine the bending rigidity and Gaussian bending stiffness
   of single-layered graphene. The bending rigidity and Gaussian bending
   stiffness of single-layered graphene are 1.44 eV (2.31 x 10(-19) N m)
   and -1.52 eV (2.43 x 10(-19) N m), respectively. The bending rigidity is
   close to the experimental result. Interestingly, the bending stiffness
   of graphene is close to that of lipid bilayers of cells about 1-2 eV,
   which might mechanically justify biological applications of graphene.}},

Abstract = {{The laser generation of vapor bubbles around plasmonic nanoparticles can
   be enhanced through the application of an ultrasound field; a technique
   referred to as photoacoustic cavitation. The combination of light and
   ultrasound allows for bubble formation at lower laser fluence and peak
   negative ultrasound pressure than can be achieved using either modality
   alone. The growth and collapse of these bubbles leads to local
   mechanical disruption and acoustic emission, and can potentially be used
   to induce and monitor tissue therapy. Photoacoustic cavitation is
   investigated for a broad range of ultrasound pressures and nanoparticle
   concentrations for gold nanorods and nanospheres. The cavitation
   threshold fluences for both nanoparticle types are found to drastically
   reduce in the presence of an ultrasound field. The results indicate that
   photoacoustic cavitation can potentially be produced at depth in
   biological tissue without exceeding the safety limits for ultrasound or
   laser radiation at the tissue surface. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{Integrated environmental modeling (IEM) is inspired by modern
   environmental problems, decisions, and policies and enabled by
   transdisciplinary science and computer capabilities that allow the
   environment to be considered in a holistic way. The problems are
   characterized by the extent of the environmental system involved,
   dynamic and interdependent nature of stressors and their impacts,
   diversity of stakeholders, and integration of social, economic, and
   environmental considerations. IEM provides a science-based structure to
   develop and organize relevant knowledge and information and apply it to
   explain, explore, and predict the behavior of environmental systems in
   response to human and natural sources of stress. During the past several
   years a number of workshops were held that brought IEM practitioners
   together to share experiences and discuss future needs and directions.
   In this paper we organize and present the results of these discussions.
   IEM is presented as a landscape containing four interdependent elements:
   applications, science, technology, and community. The elements are
   described from the perspective of their role in the landscape, current
   practices, and challenges that must be addressed. Workshop participants
   envision a global scale IEM community that leverages modern technologies
   to streamline the movement of science-based knowledge from its sources
   in research, through its organization into databases and models, to its
   integration and application for problem solving purposes. Achieving this
   vision will require that the global community of IEM stakeholders
   transcend social, and organizational boundaries and pursue greater
   levels of collaboration. Among the highest priorities for community
   action are the development of standards for publishing IEM data and
   models in forms suitable for automated discovery, access, and
   integration: education of the next generation of environmental
   stakeholders, with a focus on transdisciplinary research, development,
   and decision making: and providing a web-based platform for community
   interactions (e.g., continuous virtual workshops). Published by Elsevier

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{1570-1579}},
Abstract = {{The design of hydrogel matrices for cell encapsulation and tissue
   regeneration has become increasingly complex. Oftentimes, researchers
   seek to recapitulate specific biophysical and biochemical cues critical
   for the resident cell population and an in depth understanding of
   changes in the local microstructure and rheological properties of the
   synthetic matrix during enzymatic degradation would be extremely
   beneficial. Multiple particle tracking microrheology (MPT) enables
   simultaneous characterization of rheological properties and
   visualization of the microstructure in an evolving hydrogel scaffold.
   MPT measures the Brownian motion of fluorescently labeled probe
   particles embedded in the material, which is directly related to
   rheological properties using the Generalized Stokes-Einstein Relation
   (GSER). Here, we study a hydrogel scaffold consisting of a four-arm
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) end functionalized with norbornene that is
   cross-linked with both a nondegradable PEG-dithiol and a matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMP) degradable peptide sequence (KCGPQG down arrow
   IWGQCK) using thiol-ene chemistry. The material degradation is measured
   as a function of time and extent of degradability, focusing on measuring
   the gel-sol transition. Using time-cure superposition, we determine the
   critical degradation time and critical extent of degradability for this
   specific gel formulation as t(c) = 1.85 h and p(c) = 0.589,
   respectively, and the critical relaxation exponent, n = 0.16. Finally,
   spatial information gained by MPT measurements quantifies the
   heterogeneity within the scaffold showing that these hydrogels degrade
   homogeneously when collagenase is introduced in solution at a
   concentration of 0.1-0.3 mg mL(-1). Understanding the microstructural
   and rheological properties of a material near the gel-sol transition
   enables researchers to improve their insight as to how cells remodel
   their microenvironment when encapsulated in gels, and more precisely
   design and manipulate this parameter to improve three-dimensional
   culture systems.}},

Abstract = {{Flat, flexible, lightweight, polymer heat pipes (FPHP) were fabricated.
   The overall geometry of the heat pipe was 130 mm x 70 mm x 1.31 mm. A
   commercially available low-cost film composed of laminated sheets of
   low-density polyethylene terephthalate, aluminum and polyethylene layers
   was used as the casing. A triple-layer sintered copper woven mesh served
   as a liquid wicking structure, and water was the working fluid. A coarse
   nylon woven mesh provided space for vapor transport and mechanical
   rigidity. Thermal power ranging from 5 to 30 W was supplied to the
   evaporator while the device was flexed at 0 degrees, 45 degrees and 90
   degrees. The thermal resistance of the FPHP ranged from 1.2 to 3.0 K W-1
   depending on the operating conditions while the thermal resistance for a
   similar-sized solid copper reference was a constant at 4.6 K W-1. With
   25 W power input, the thermal resistance of the liquid-vapor core of the
   FPHP was 23\% of a copper reference sample with identical laminated
   polymer material. This work shows a promising combination of
   technologies that has the potential to usher in a new generation of
   highly flexible, lightweight, low-cost, high-performance thermal
   management solutions.}},

Title = {{A novel technique for measuring the kinetics of high-temperature
   gasification of biomass char with steam}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Pages = {{749-757}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Solar thermal gasification of biomass is a promising technology that
   allows for operation at high temperature without burning a large portion
   of the biomass feedstock. Additionally, the process allows for solar
   energy to be stored and transported in chemical form. In order to design
   efficient solar reactors, a kinetic rate expression for high-temperature
   steam gasification is needed. Various methods have been used to measure
   the steam gasification rate of coal and biomass char at temperatures up
   to 1000 degrees C. These conventional techniques often fail to collect
   accurate kinetic data at temperatures above 1000 degrees C due to heat
   and mass transfer resistance, and the time constants associated with the
   analysis system. In this paper we discuss a novel kinetics measurement
   technique based on a modified fixed bed and data collected solely from a
   gas flow meter. The technique was used to collect kinetic rate data for
   switchgrass char over a range of reaction conditions between 1000
   degrees C and 1150 degrees C. An empirical expression to predict the
   kinetic rate as a function of the degree of conversion, temperature,
   steam concentration, and hydrogen concentration was developed. The
   random pore model was used to predict the reaction rate as a function of
   conversion, and the initial kinetic rate was fit using a
   Langmuir-Hinshelwood type expression. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

   copolymer grafted nanoparticles: a Monte Carlo simulation study}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{155-169}},
Abstract = {{We use Monte Carlo simulations to study AB copolymer-grafted
   nanoparticles to elucidate the effect of blockiness (length of
   contiguous blocks of like-monomers) in the grafted monomer sequence on
   the shape, size, and structure of assembled nanoparticle clusters for a
   range of monomer-monomer and monomer-particle interactions. The graft
   sequence dictates the ease or difficulty of the grafted chains to form
   attractive like-monomer (A-A or B-B) contacts while minimizing repulsive
   unlike-monomer (A-B) contacts within an assembled cluster or a dispersed
   state. When A-B repulsion is negligible, with increasing blockiness at
   constant graft length the cluster size and average coordination number
   decrease in the presence of A-A or B-B attractions, and are
   approximately constant in the presence of A-A and B-B attractions. When
   A-B repulsion is strong, the cluster size and average coordination
   number increase with increasing blockiness for small and large
   particles. For small particles, with strong B-B attraction and A-B
   repulsion, increasing blockiness leads to increasing anisotropy in
   cluster shape, while strong A-A attraction produces isotropic clusters
   regardless of the graft sequence. The effect of graft sequence on
   cluster shape is reduced for large particles as compared to small
   particles, at constant graft length. Lastly, the extent to which
   monomer-particle attractive interactions change the above trends is
   highly dependent on the relative strength of monomer-particle to
   monomer-monomer interactions, in addition to the ratio of particle size
   to graft length, and the grafting density.}},

Title = {{Design and synthesis of ice-templated PSA cryogels for water
   purification: towards tailored morphology and properties}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{224-234}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogels are capable of absorbing water several times their dry mass
   that subsequently can be released by the application of pressure,
   temperature change, or other external stimuli. As such, they offer
   promise for providing potable water in disaster relief applications.
   However, the swelling and mechanical properties of hydrogels need to be
   improved. The objectives of this study were (i) to demonstrate that the
   properties of poly(sodium acrylate) (PSA) cryogels can be tuned by
   modulating synthesis conditions such as freezing temperature, initial
   monomer and initiator concentrations, and crosslinker ratio, and (ii) to
   investigate the potential of PSA cryogels as an integral membrane for
   water purification in emergencies. PSA cryogels with a superfast
   swelling rate and a high degree of swelling that can withstand large
   compression strains were synthesized by conducting copolymerization
   reactions between N,N'-methylenebis(acrylamide) and sodium acrylate
   under subzero temperature conditions. The pore morphology was
   characterized using confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning
   electron microscopy. It was shown that a lower freezing temperature and
   reduced initial monomer concentrations formed PSA cryogels with smaller
   more interconnected pores, while a higher initiator concentration in the
   ``freezing before gelation{''} mode resulted in smaller pores. PSA
   cryogels with open interconnected pores had both a higher rate and
   degree of swelling, and high elasticity in response to compression. The
   separation efficiency of PSA cryogels was evaluated by determining
   turbidity removal over five operational cycles. The turbidity removal
   efficiency of the PSA cryogel having the highest swelling degree
   increased to 90\% towards the fifth cycle. The water recovery during the
   five operational cycles ranged from 71 to 77\% under a vacuum suction of
   70 kPa (absolute pressure) for one minute. PSA cryogels having smaller
   average pore sizes were found to have higher turbidity removal
   efficiencies.}},

Volume = {{9}},

Pages = {{462-471}},
Abstract = {{The helical nanofilament (HNF) liquid crystal phase is a complex,
   hierarchical self-assembly in which bent-core molecules cooled from the
   isotropic melt form dense periodic arrays of nanoscale filaments of
   twisted smectic layers, a structure driven by an inherent tendency of
   the layers to be locally saddle-splayed. Here we report the results of a
   study of mixtures of an HNF-forming bent-core liquid crystal with a
   variety of organic guest molecules, showing that the high temperature,
   isotropic phase is completely mixed but that upon cooling the filaments
   form and grow, expelling the guest material from their internal volume.
   The nanofilaments form a network which acts as a porous nanoconfinement
   medium of large internal area (similar to 100 m(2) cm(-3)), with the
   guest material confined to nanoscale interstitial volumes between the
   filaments. Such helical nanofilament networks represent a robust
   platform for potential applications in chiral separations, asymmetric
   synthesis, and photonic metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{The technique to construct the artificial organ made of cultured cells
   is required in many fields such as tissue engineering and drug
   development. However, the tissue-like construction more than 200 P m
   thick has central hypoxia and results in necrosis because of the
   limitation of diffusion of materials. Then, we will propose a method to
   form a tissue-like construction including vascular network in itself.
   Biocompatible artificial vessel was wrapped in cell-sheet cocultivated
   with HUVEC and NIH3T3. Culture medium perfused into the artificial
   vessel will be diffused into the whole construction through vascular
   network of HUVEC. This technique will be increases the viability of the
   cells in the construction.}},

Abstract = {{Compressive sensing allows us to recover signals that are linearly
   sparse in some basis from a smaller number of measurements than
   traditionally required. However, it has been shown that many classes of
   images or video can be more efficiently modeled as lying on a nonlinear
   manifold, and hence described as a non-linear function of a few
   underlying parameters. Recently, there has been growing interest in
   using these manifold models to reduce the required number of compressive
   sensing measurements. However, the complexity of manifold models has
   been an obstacle to their use in efficient data acquisition. In this
   paper, we introduce a new algorithm for applying manifold models in
   compressive sensing using kernel methods. Our proposed algorithm, kernel
   compressive sensing (KCS), is the kernel version of classical
   compressive sensing. It uses dictionary learning in the feature space to
   build an efficient model for one or more signal manifolds. It then is
   able to formulate the problem of recovering the signal's coordinates in
   the manifold representation as an underdetermined linear inverse problem
   as in traditional compressive sensing. Standard compressive sensing
   recovery methods can thus be used to recover these coordinates, avoiding
   additional computational complexity. We present experimental results
   demonstrating the efficiency and efficacy of this algorithm in
   manifold-based compressive sensing.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we establish an approximate capacity region for a class
   of multiple access interference channels consisting of a multiple-access
   channel (MAC) and a point-to-point (P2P) link that are mutually
   interfering but in which there is interference only from one of the
   transmitters of the MAC to the receiver of the P2P link, known
   henceforth as the partially connected multiple-access interference
   channel, or simply as PMAIC. It is shown that for semi-deterministic
   PMAICs, single-user coding at the first transmitter of the MAC and H-K
   superposition coding at the second transmitter of the MAC and the
   transmitter of the P2P achieves a rate region that is within a
   quantifiable gap of the capacity region, thereby generalizing the result
   by Telatar and Tse for the 2-user semi-deterministic interference
   channel. Applying this result to the scalar Gaussian channel, we derive
   bounds on its capacity region within one bit, which can be seen as an
   extension of the work by Etkin et al for the Gaussian interference
   channel.}},

Abstract = {{A great deal of literature focuses on innovations that are designed to
   improve educational performance. Although some innovations are designed
   and implemented to address learning in a very specific domain, others
   influence student learning more generally as they are applicable
   regardless of specific content (e.g., mechanisms for delivering new
   content, new strategies for student-student interactions, and
   application of new technologies). Many instructors form the hypothesis
   that a particular innovation will enhance student learning and,
   consequently, the ability to achieve desired learning objectives.
   Testing such a hypothesis can be troublesome when confounding factors
   exist in the student body's learning environment such as scheduled
   breaks, social stressors, and activities occurring in other courses.
   Multiple baseline testing is a promising strategy for statistically
   controlling the influence of confounding factors when innovations are
   implemented consistently across multiple groups of students. This
   strategy involves measuring student performance, implementing the
   innovation at a randomly selected time, and continuing to measure
   student performance as the innovation is integrated within the course.
   The impact of the innovation treatment can be measured using time series
   regression. This paper presents the proper mechanics of multiple
   baseline testing, discusses the relatively small body of research on
   this method that exists outside the medical and biological fields, and
   provides clear recommendations for managing threats to validity in
   engineering education research.}},

Abstract = {{While the importance of trust has largely been explored in large
   business organizations, little attention has been given to the role of
   trust in one-on-one mentoring relationships between engineers(1). Trust
   has been relatively understudied in academic settings, especially in
   mentoring relationships between undergraduate and graduate students in
   research laboratory settings. By assessing ways of creating and
   maintaining trust in engineering relationships, we will be able to
   create more comprehensive guidelines on building relationships through
   research experiences. In order to assess the level of trust in
   engineering relationships, and particularly in underrepresented groups
   of women and minorities (URMs), our research team will explore the role
   of trust in an established research-based mentoring program, called Your
   Own Research Experience at CU (YOU'RE@CU), that pairs graduate student
   mentors with undergraduate mentees.
   The YOU'RE@CU program takes place at the University of Colorado
   Boulder's College of Engineering and Applied Science and is in its third
   year of operation. The program goals include improving the retention
   rate of undergraduate women and URMs in engineering, increasing the
   undergraduate's interest in research, and preparing graduate student
   mentors for leadership roles in either industry or academia. The program
   is held during the spring semester where the undergraduate students
   complete a one-credit pass/fail seminar course in which they learn about
   a variety of research practices and opportunities, become familiar with
   the graduate school admission process, meet industry professionals, and
   tour college research laboratories hosted by faculty members. In
   addition to the seminar, undergraduate mentees are paired with a
   graduate mentor to complete a hypothesis or objective-based,
   level-appropriate project during the same spring semester. To gain
   further information on student attitudes, undergraduate students
   complete several surveys to gauge their excitement and interest in
   engineering prior to beginning their research. The students also
   complete a post-research survey about their experiences. The
   undergraduate students gain practical research experience and
   demonstrate their accomplishments in an end-of-semester poster
   presentation. Both the undergraduates and graduate mentors complete
   weekly qualitative reflective questions through an online process.
   Through both the pre- and post-surveys, as well as reflective questions
   posed during the semester, the research team gathered information on
   maintaining and creating trust in these mentoring relationships. We
   compared and contrasted our mentor-mentee relationship to the perceived
   trust model created by Mayer, Davis, and Schoorman(1). Our initial
   findings show that ability, benevolence, and integrity are all factors
   that create trust in engineering relationships. However, additional
   factors such as group collaboration and feelings of inclusiveness allow
   mentees to create a stronger level of trust in research-based
   relationships. By evaluating this mentoring program, we were able to
   gain more information on trust that can help us empower and inform the
   novice engineer and mentors in research-focused engineering
   relationships. The research results from this program can guide others
   as they seek to establish similar programs in mentoring and research
   programs addressing retention of underrepresented students in
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering students have a growing number of opportunities to engage in
   service-learning and co-curricular service activities. Because of the
   range of opportunities that exist for students to engage in community
   service activities, the umbrella term Learning Through Service (LTS) has
   been created. As these types of opportunities increase, the range and
   diversity of these initiatives has not been well documented. While some
   more established programs have published extensively on their program
   characteristics and assessment outcomes (i.e. SLICE at the University of
   Massachusetts Lowell and EPICS at Purdue), many newer and emerging
   programs have not yet have published any information. In fact, some of
   these LTS activities are not routinely included in courses but are
   integrated intermittently by motivated faculty - sometimes without
   widespread recognition within their own college or university. This
   paper presents an initial summary of some of the lesser publicized LTS
   activities based on a literature search and two recent workshops
   associated with the NSF-grant on Engineering Faculty Engagement in
   Learning Through Service (EFELTS). Emerging LTS patterns, opportunities,
   challenges, and resources are summarized to provide an expanded view of
   the landscape of what is currently happening in engineering.}},

Abstract = {{As the engineering profession advances, there is a recognition that
   engineers must interact across disciplinary and cultural boundaries to
   successfully address complex problems. Directly or indirectly, an
   engineer's work affects society and therefore it is critical that they
   give full consideration to the relationship between the engineering
   profession and society throughout the design process. Many professional
   engineering organizations are calling for engineers with a better
   understanding of the societal context in which they work 1, 2, 3, 4, but
   there is no clear pathway to teach this understanding to students, nor
   how students will interpret what they are provided. With the profession
   and engineering educators pushing towards this goal, it seems critical
   to talk with students to find out how they view the engineering
   profession in society and, more specifically, how they see themselves
   benefitting society as engineers.
   Twenty-five students representing Civil, Environmental, Mechanical, and
   Aerospace Engineering, primarily Senior and Graduate students, engaged
   in conversations around their views of social responsibility and the
   role of engineering in society. These interviews lasted 30 to 60 minutes
   and were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using issue-focused
   emergent coding 5. Three different interview methods were used to elicit
   conversation; semi-structured interviews, interviews focused on
   questions from a survey about attitudes of personal and professional
   responsibility, and finally a variation of Rappaport Timelines 6 used to
   examine life events which students identified as formative for their
   views of engineering and society. This paper explores several themes
   that emerged from these conversations including: (a) if a desire to help
   society attracted students to engineering; (b) how students talk about
   engineers interacting with society; and (c) what role feedback from
   society, the community, or the client should play in the engineering
   design process.}},

Abstract = {{Grounded in motivation theory, this research evaluates how the context
   of project-based service-learning (PBSL) affects aspects of student
   motivation in a required undergraduate mechanical engineering course -
   Component Design. Our research aims to answer: 1) How does the context
   of service in project-based learning affect student motivation? 2) What
   factors are most influential on student motivation to persist in
   project-based learning experiences?
   Component Design is a required project-based course that introduces
   junior mechanical engineers to fundamental machine design concepts. In
   spring 2011, the control group participated in a conventional
   project-based learning (PBL) experience - to build an aesthetically
   pleasing vehicle that could be powered by a cordless electric drill. In
   spring 2012, the treatment group participated in a PBSL experience -
   fabricating adapted tricycles for children in the community with
   physical disabilities.
   We found that both the PBL and PBSL contexts sustained student
   motivation for the course and the project. Students in both cohorts
   began the course with relatively high values of interest, value, and
   expectancy for success. Students in both cohorts ended the course with
   relatively high values (and in some cases significant gains) of
   interest, value, and feelings of success in the course and the project.
   Students from both cohorts also reported relatively high indicators of
   course and project engagement.
   The results also indicated that for students in the PBL control group
   the most significant predictor of motivation was their confidence in
   non-technical skills while for students in the PBSL control group, the
   most significant predictor was initial value of the course and the
   project. Initial course and project interest, skill confidence, prior
   knowledge of course topics, and prior experience in design projects were
   also among the most important predictors of motivation in both project
   contexts. Gender was not found to be a significant predictor of any
   motivation indicators.}},

Abstract = {{In general, underrepresented engineering students who enter the college
   underprepared in mathematics lack the basic skills necessary to succeed
   in calculus. Numerous factors contribute to these issues, including high
   school mathematics instruction deficiencies such as the absence of
   qualified teacher resources, poor instruction, and low student interest
   in higher-level math. The Engineering GoldShirt Program at the College
   of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado Boulder
   is piloting a well-supported new pre-calculus for engineers course in
   the college with the aim to adequately prepare these students for
   success in calculus, so as to not lose them at the gateway of the
   engineering education pathway.
   In previous semesters in an effort to gain pre-calculus mastery, these
   GoldShirt students took math courses outside of the college in order to
   prepare to take the calculus sequence in the engineering curriculum. A
   subsequent review of these students' results in calculus I showed less
   than stellar performance. Of the students who took math courses outside
   of engineering, 64\% earned less than a B-and 33\% received Ds or Fs in
   calculus I. In response to this failure at the important mathematics
   juncture to success in engineering, a new pre-calculus for engineers
   course was developed in collaboration with the Applied Math Program to
   prepare students with a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts
   beyond what they previously received and prepare them for calculus
   success. A pilot class of 16 took the course in spring 2012, of which
   many moved on to calculus I in fall 2012 (pilot 1). A description and
   modifications to the pre-calculus for engineers course are presented in
   the paper, including the adoption of the ALEKS Learning System to assess
   and teach student math skills. Students are expected to take ownership
   of their learning and progress through modules to attain concept
   proficiency while meeting the lecture and recitation expectations for
   the course. Student performance in ALEKS contributes substantially to
   final course grades.
   In fall 2012, pilot 2 of the class enrolled 29 students of which 22 were
   GoldShirt students, and 7 GoldShirt students enrolled in the course in
   the spring 2013. Two sections of pre-calculus for engineers will be
   offered in the fall 2013 semester (pilot 3). Other first-year students
   in the college placed below the threshold for calculus I readiness,
   based on placement scores from ALEKS, and are not included in the new
   course (about 100 additional students or 14\% of the new first-year
   class). Recommendations made to the college to expand the pre-calculus
   for engineers course have not yet been adopted.
   This paper examines the performance results of the pre-calculus for
   engineers course and compares them to students' subsequent calculus I
   performance, uncovering the keys to proficiency in math and calculus
   success for engineering students with high potential who are
   underprepared in mathematics. To gauge student understanding and mastery
   of foundational mathematical concepts necessary for calculus success,
   the results of course assessment via post-survey, focus group and case
   study are described.}},

Abstract = {{The desire to broaden diversity in engineering has permeated STEM
   discourse and engineering education for decades. National leaders and
   funding agencies have given attention, priority and inducements to
   increase diversity in engineering. Yet, even with pervasive
   college-based initiatives aimed at broadening participation, national
   results remain stagnant. In the College of Engineering and Applied
   Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, an NSF-sponsored research
   project is creating a system-based model with elements and practices
   that could be applied to begin to alleviate the shortfall of diverse
   students in U.S. engineering schools.
   ``Inclusive excellence{''} refers to creating pathways to and through
   engineering that promote success for a highly diverse student body
   through learning communities, engaging academics and innovative
   policies. The Inclusive Excellence Research Project aims to investigate
   and define a system of varied pathways to and through engineering
   composed of three integrated sub-models: Access, Performance and
   Retention.
   The data and results presented in this paper represent a glimpse into
   the larger Inclusive Excellence Research Project, specifically exploring
   the impact of our first-year curriculum strategy for underrepresented
   students. The research team posits that early development of
   professional engineering identity is a critical piece to scaffolding
   academic excellence and persistence within engineering. Identity
   development is investigated over time in four key curricular
   interventions-two short summer bridge programs targeting
   underrepresented populations, a large first-year engineering design
   course, and a large introduction to engineering course designed to help
   students understand various engineering career tracks. A comparison
   across these interventions begins to reveal elements leading to identity
   development related to community, team-building, fostering engineering
   skills and knowledge, and understanding engineering career paths.
   For each intervention, identity was measured via the Group
   Identification Survey, a product of the Academic Pathways Study. The
   survey was administered before and after the two bridge programs and
   pre-and post-course for the two first-semester courses-totaling 510
   participants across programs. To determine possible correlates of
   identity, students were also administered additional survey items,
   influenced in part by the Academic Pathways of People Learning
   Engineering (APPLE) survey. Four underrepresented
   populations-underrepresented minorities, women, low-socioeconomic, and
   first-generation students-were investigated for identity development.
   Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance
   procedures to determine pre to post differences and between demographic
   groups and programs. Results indicate significant differences in
   identity development across all four course/programs and specific
   relationships between demographics as well as additional associated
   variables.}},

   (FIPSE)-Sustainable Energy and Aeronautical Engineering Program (SEAEP)
   brings together a consortium of four universities: Florida State
   University (FSU), the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt), Universidade
   Federal de Itajuba (UNIFEI) and Federal University of Parana (UFPR) to
   train post-secondary engineering students for global engineering
   careers. A key aspect of this program is using design courses as a
   vehicle for student and faculty collaboration-both U.S. and Brazilian
   students are exposed to technical, professional and cultural experiences
   that can only take place through a international exchange program.
   The purpose of this paper is to highlight how the cross-institutional
   international capstone design project course is impacting the program's
   anticipated U.S. student outcomes. We briefly review the FIPSE-SEAEP
   structure; detail the program goals, objectives and anticipated U.S.
   student outcomes; and provide an assessment approach to evaluating
   program criteria for a small cohort of student participants. The data
   presented represents the views of the FSU student participants from the
   2011-2012 cohort. Assessment results indicate that FSU students are
   achieving 5 out of 8 of the anticipated U.S. student outcomes. Last, we
   highlight the strengths and weaknesses of the FIPSE-SEAEP, with respect
   to international capstone design project courses, and give
   recommendations for improving the program, which center on project-based

Abstract = {{The present investigation is a case study of a first year design course
   with a survey and follow-up interviews to assess the experiences of
   students while in the classroom and during a follow-up trip to Peru to
   install the design. This mixed-methods study investigated the use of
   environmental engineering design for developing communities as the
   project topic in a first-year design course and specifically focused on
   the developmental effects on students who traveled to Peru to implement
   their design in a rural community. Data collected during an
   end-of-course survey and qualitative data garnered from interviews with
   three students who traveled to implement the design indicated that most
   students in the course gained an understanding of the concept of
   engineering for developing communities and found the topic more
   interesting than those offered in other course sections. Students who
   traveled gained deeper insight into both the topic and the challenges
   involved with working in developing communities. Students from both
   groups (travelers and non-travelers) noted an interest in pursuing
   future opportunities to work in developing communities, most likely
   through volunteer opportunities. Overall, results indicated that the
   course topic provided an effective context for learning about the design
   process, introducing unique aspects of engineering for developing
   communities, and motivating students to explore this topic further.}},

Abstract = {{The EFELTS project consists of a three-year effort focused on Learning
   Through Service (LTS) -a pedagogical method that combines academic
   learning with service. These educational efforts can range from
   curricular service-learning to extracurricular community engagement
   efforts; each enhancing the educational experience for engineering
   students. The EFELTS project involves a team of investigators from five,
   diverse institutions invoking a 4D Process (Discover, Distill, Design,
   and Disseminate) to realize two project goals: a) evaluate the impacts
   on engineering faculty currently engaged in LTS efforts; and b) empower
   and aid faculty to implement new, or enhance existing, LTS efforts. This
   paper focuses on the Design component of the process, specifically the
   development and implementation of a series of faculty workshops on LTS
   efforts and faculty views on LTS in engineering education.
   The EFELTS project team developed and conducted two, 2-day workshops for
   engineering faculty involved with new or existing LTS efforts at their
   institutions. A total of 36 participants from various academic
   institutions and with various employment levels attended workshops in
   Houghton, MI (August 2012) and Boulder, CO (September 2012). Workshop
   participant selection was partially based on the LTS activity that they
   proposed to implement/enhance at their institution. Workshop design
   consisted of three connected components -1) LTS grounding, 2)
   preliminary development of an LTS effort, and 3) exploring future
   options for a national LTS community. Exercises used in the grounding
   component explored participant's knowledge of LTS and their existing
   experiences and/or beliefs on the relevance of LTS to engineering
   education. The preliminary LTS development component, which encompassed
   the majority of the workshop's effort, focused on preliminary
   development and/or enhancement of participants' LTS efforts. This
   development effort was facilitated by the creation of an LTS `blueprint'
   that provided a framework through which to structure LTS efforts.
   Finally, the workshop explored ways to build a `community-of-practice'
   to help support the continued development and use of LTS in engineering
   education.
   Formative and summative workshop evaluations, including qualitative and
   Likert-type quantitative questions, were administered to gage
   participant satisfaction with specific workshop content and exercises.
   In summary, workshop participants had a high level of overall
   satisfaction with the workshop. Most participants commented favorably on
   the use of the LTS `blueprint' as a framework to 1) structure their LTS
   efforts and 2) provide a methodology to continually review and enhance
   desired goals and values that their LTS effort intends to provide. In
   addition, participants became keenly aware of the need for appropriate
   assessment of LTS efforts to aid in the continuous enhancement of LTS,
   as well as to provide evidence of the benefits/costs associated with the
   use of LTS in engineering education. Specific results from LTS grounding
   exercises indicated that major benefits to LTS exist for all
   stakeholders including: 1) positive development of students' technical
   and professional skills, 2) real-world application of engineering
   concepts, and 3) numerous possible benefits to community and
   institutional stakeholders. These exercises also revealed that LTS can
   negatively burden available faculty time and may require additional
   financial and human resources. Suggestions for future efforts in
   creating a `community of practice' of LTS practitioners include
   developing additional workshops, modules, and other learning tools to
   further disseminate workshop and EFELTS goals. The development of a web
   portal through which LTS practitioners in engineering education, whether
   experts or novice, can share experiences was also suggested.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of designers, managers, and workers to identify construction
   hazards is a fundamental skill that promotes construction safety in
   practices. Traditionally, construction management programs focus on
   teaching this topic using the fundamentals of the Occupational Safety
   and Health Administration and the associated regulations and delivering
   this material with traditional lecture-based approaches. This study
   introduces a new method of hazard recognition pedagogy aimed at rapidly
   improving signal detection and situational awareness. Specifically, a
   high-fidelity augmented reality software tool built around energy-based
   cognitive mnemonics (SAVES) that immerses students in a representative
   environment was created and experimentally tested with a large class. In
   a series of pre-tests, construction engineering and management students
   were provided with randomly-selected sets of photographs of construction
   worksites and were asked to identify the hazards present. In a one-month
   randomly staged series, students were exposed to SAVES. In SAVES
   students were asked to identify hazards and the system provided
   real-time assessment of their performance and feedback for improvement
   of future iterations. Following this experience, a second series of
   post-tests was administered. The impact of the augmented reality
   experience was empirically measured using multiple baseline testing and
   inferential statistics. The results indicate that students' and workers'
   abilities to recognize hazards increased, on average, by 21 percent and
   26 percent, respectively (p < 0.001). Qualitative feedback indicates
   that the approach enhanced intellectual excitement and retention.}},

Abstract = {{A novel teaching approach, the Body-Based Approach, uses the framework
   of active learning to structure the implementation of everyday
   engineering examples in recitations as part of an Engineering Statics
   course in fall 2012 at a large public university. As the gateway course
   to many engineering disciplines, Statics is typically the first
   technical engineering course an aspiring undergraduate takes and is
   frequently a prerequisite for subsequent technical requirements along
   the engineering pathway. With a class size of approximately 200 people
   at such a focal transition point, mandatory 50-minute active learning
   recitations were added to a twice-weekly lecture for Engineering Statics
   with the aim of improving the educational experience for the students. A
   total of 6 recitation sections were split equally into two flavors
   depending on the type of examples used: Body-Based or Traditional
   (recitation class size = 35, total students = 200). All recitations
   incorporated active learning activities and awareness of the situated
   process of learning, with care taken to select relevant and easily
   relatable examples for students to physically interact with and learn
   from. While the Body-Based Approach uses different aspects of the body
   and internal body sensations to illustrate concepts like Forces,
   Moments, Friction, Equilibrium, and Distributed Loading, the Traditional
   Approach uses more traditional examples including C-clamps, desk chairs,
   trees, and other objects that are separate from the body but still
   tangible. During recitations, students worked in small groups of 3 to 4
   students to complete a variety of learning activities using either
   Body-Based or Traditional examples, under the guidance of two
   co-instructing recitation instructors. Recitations were formatted to
   align with the Engage Engineering Everyday Examples in Engineering (E-3)
   Initiative(1).
   The resulting changes to student conceptual knowledge, feelings of
   belonging, confidence, and engagement are being examined both
   quantitatively and qualitatively during the course of the semester. This
   paper introduces the research design, provides examples of the
   curriculum, and gives details on executing such a course model with a
   team of recitation instructors. Additionally, initial analysis of the
   Pre-/Post-Concept Inventories and selected confidence items from Pre-/
   Post-Engineering Attitudinal Surveys will be presented for discussion.}},

Abstract = {{YOU'RE@CU is a mentoring program in which graduate students are paired
   with 1st or 2nd year undergraduate engineering students to conduct
   research is now entering its third year of operation at The University
   of Colorado Boulder. The undergraduate mentees benefit from exposure to
   a research community and the process of doing cutting-edge engineering
   research, while the graduate student mentors benefit from the experience
   of being a mentor, defining a project and guiding a novice engineer
   through the ups and downs of doing research. During their participation
   in the mentoring program, undergraduates are assessed via pre- and
   post-surveys to gauge several dimensions of their engineering identity
   and confidence. Additionally, undergraduates respond to biweekly
   reflective questions to give researchers a qualitative flavor of their
   experiences in the mentoring program. Graduate mentors similarly respond
   to several reflective questions about their experiences during their
   participation in the program and complete pre- and post-assessments.
   This paper presents the qualitative data collected from graduate student
   mentors during the first two years of program implementation. Graduate
   student responses have been examined in the context of each individual
   mentoring partnership to understand the impact of certain mentor
   training and individual mentor characteristics in establishing fruitful
   mentoring relationships. Initial findings indicate two salient mentoring
   models that describe how graduate students actively mentor undergraduate
   researchers: supervision vs. coaching. In the supervisory model, the
   graduate mentor sets up a hierarchical boss/subordinate relationship
   with their undergraduate mentee, while in the coaching model the
   graduate mentor and undergraduate mentee work together in collaborative
   partnership. Mentoring program directors and mentors at large can
   benefit from the experiences of these graduate mentors, as researchers
   look to develop better training materials and improve program structures
   to increase the likelihood of positive research experiences for future
   program participants.}},

Abstract = {{Learning through Service (LTS) is an umbrella term that includes, both
   curricular and extracurricular activities, reflecting that there are
   many models that exist currently for how faculty use opportunities for
   students to learn while providing service to a community. Over the past
   decade, Learning through Service has proliferated in higher education as
   an effective teaching and learning method. As the pedagogy continues to
   gain momentum, and many colleges and universities in the United States
   have designed their engineering curriculum and extra-curricular
   activities to include experiential learning, including service-learning.
   Nevertheless, despite the curriculum overhaul and increase in the use of
   LTS in engineering, there have been limited studies to evaluate the
   reasons for faculty interest in LTS and their experiences.
   In 2011, investigators from Tufts University, James Madison University,
   Michigan Technological University, the University of Colorado Boulder,
   and the University of Massachusetts Lowell were awarded a grant from the
   National Science Foundation to evaluate the experience and motivations
   of faculty currently engaged in LTS efforts; and to empower additional
   faculty to implement LTS. Expectations included interviewing faculty
   engaged in LTS efforts in engineering in order to understand their
   motivations, and what teaching, learning and assessment methodologies
   they use to enhance engineering education.
   The purpose of this study is to: a) understand why engineering faculty
   engage their students in LTS, and b) understand how engineering faculty
   implement LTS initiatives. (This study explores faculty efforts in both
   service-learning and community service). This study is focused on
   engineering faculty members who integrate LTS efforts in engineering
   across a broad range of institutions of higher education. Twenty-nine
   interviews were conducted with engineering LTS practitioners to explore
   their interests, challenges, and results of their efforts. Analysis of
   the interview transcripts reveals 1) faculty members who are passionate
   about LTS tend to play a leading role in promoting LTS within their
   institution; 2) faculty's primary interest in integrating LTS is
   predominantly motivated by a desire to improve the quality of their
   teaching and student learning; 3) faculty consistently encounter
   challenges related to course design, resource limitations, increased
   workload, and lack of adequate support from their institutions. The
   discussion in this paper focuses on the areas that appear to limit the
   effectiveness of their LTS efforts and directions for future research.}},

Title = {{Impact of TEAMS Clubs: An Afterschool Engineering Enrichment Program
   that Impacts K-12 Students and College Student Leaders}},
Booktitle = {{2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE}},

Abstract = {{Many examples of university engineering education programs designed to
   impact K-12 student learning and access are described in the literature.
   Unfortunately, most do not report repeated engagement with students who
   are assessed over time.
   There is a need to better determine the results of evolving engineering
   instruction in K-12 schools and the best practices for implementation.
   This paper discusses a successful model for a weekly afterschool
   elementary engineering enrichment program that has been in place for six
   years. TEAMS clubs, named after an umbrella K-12 engineering education
   initiative (Tomorrows Engineers...creAte. iMagine. Succeed.) at the
   University of Colorado Boulder, are led by undergraduate engineering
   students, using handson activities that allow students to learn
   first-hand that engineering is creative and explorative. The
   school-based TEAMS Clubs are popular, oftentimes with more students
   interested in participating than there is space. Many of the elementary
   students in TEAMS Clubs are concurrently engaged in engineering learning
   opportunities during an in-class, academic-year NSF-funded GK-12
   program. To supplement the in-class program goals, the afterschool TEAMS
   Clubs also expand the knowledge of and exposure to engineering careers.
   While program assessment has been at the core of these clubs since their
   inception, the impacts of the TEAMS Clubs have not been previously
   reported in the literature. To understand student perceptions of their
   repeated and frequent exposure to engineering, pre/post engineering
   attitudes are assessed for students in grades 3-5 in nine partner
   elementary schools. TEAMS Club leader impact is also discussed,
   supporting the theory that the clubs have a broader effect than on the
   elementary students themselves. Hosting teachers are also surveyed to
   glean their feedback on the clubs' value. Additionally, information is
   provided on how schools elsewhere can replicate and implement the TEAMS
   model, with minimal funding and high impact. The TeachEngineering
   digital library, also an NSF-funded initiative, is revealed as a primary
   source for TEAMS Clubs curricular activities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is aimed at presenting the car-integrated framework in which
   the validation of automobile applications as well as driver's health

   Context information is important for two reasons: first, it helps to
   interpret driving situations during data processing. Second, we expected

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the relationship between uncertainty and a
   designer's ability to influence social behavior. Pigovian taxes are a
   common approach to social coordination. However, guaranteeing efficient
   behavior typically requires that the system designer has complete
   knowledge of the user population's sensitivity to taxation. In this
   paper, we explore the effect of relaxing this requirement in the context
   of congestion games with affine costs. Focusing on the class of scaled
   Pigovian taxes, we derive the optimal tolling scheme that minimizes the
   worst-case efficiency loss under uncertainty in user sensitivity.
   Furthermore, we derive explicit bounds which highlight how the level of
   uncertainty in sensitivity degrades performance.}},

Abstract = {{Emergent behavior in natural and manmade systems can often be
   characterized by the limiting distribution of a class of Markov
   processes termed regular perturbed processes. Resistance trees have
   gained popularity as a computationally efficient way to characterize the
   support of the limiting distribution; however, there are three main
   limitations of this approach. First, it requires finding a minimum
   weight spanning tree for each state in a potentially large state space.
   Second, perturbations to transition probabilities must decay at an
   exponentially smooth rate. Lastly, the approach is shown to hold purely
   in the context of finite Markov chains. In this paper we seek to address
   these limitations by developing new tools for characterizing the
   limiting distribution. First, we provide necessary conditions for
   stochastic stability via a coarse, and less computationally intensive,
   state space analysis. Next, we identify necessary conditions for
   stochastic stability when smooth convergence requirements are relaxed.
   Finally, we establish similar tools for stochastic stability analysis in
   Markov chains over a continuous state space.}},

Abstract = {{The log-linear learning algorithm has been extensively studied in game
   theoretic and distributed control literature. A central appeal of
   log-linear learning for distributed control is that it often guarantees
   agents' behavior will converge in probability to the optimal
   configuration. However, one of its central issues is that the worst case
   convergence time can be prohibitively long, e.g., exponential in the
   number of players. We formalize a modified log-linear learning algorithm
   whose worst case convergence time is roughly linear in the number of
   players. We prove this characterization in semi-anonymous potential
   games with limited populations, i.e., in potential games where the
   agents' utility functions can be expressed as a function of aggregate
   behavior within each population.}},

Abstract = {{Game theory is a well-established discipline in the social sciences that
   is primarily used for modeling social behavior. Traditionally, the
   preferences of the individual agents are modeled as utility functions
   and the resulting behavior is assumed to be an equilibrium concept
   associated with these modeled utility functions, e.g., Nash equilibrium.
   This is in stark contrast to the role of game theory in engineering
   systems where the goal is to design both the agents' utility functions
   and an adaptation rule such that the resulting global behavior is
   desirable. The transition of game theory from a modeling tool for social
   systems to a design tool for engineering systems promotes several new
   research directions that we will discuss in this talk. In particular,
   this talk will focus on the question of how to design admissible agent
   utility functions such that the resulting game possesses desirable
   properties, e.g., the existence and efficiency of pure Nash equilibria.
   Our motivation for considering pure Nash equilibria stems from the fact
   that adaptation rules can frequently be derived which guarantee that the
   collective behavior will converge to such pure Nash equilibria.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines techniques for finding falsifying trajectories of
   hybrid systems using an approach that we call trajectory splicing. Many
   formal verification techniques for hybrid systems, including flowpipe
   construction, can identify plausible abstract counterexamples for
   property violations. However, there is often a gap between the reported
   abstract counterexamples and the concrete system trajectories. Our
   approach starts with a candidate sequence of disconnected trajectory
   segments, each segment lying inside a discrete mode. However, such
   disconnected segments do not form concrete violations due to the gaps
   that exist between the ending state of one segment and the starting
   state of the subsequent segment. Therefore, trajectory splicing uses
   local optimization to minimize the gap between these segments,
   effectively splicing them together to form a concrete trajectory.
   We demonstrate the use of our approach for falsifying safety properties
   of hybrid systems using standard optimization techniques. As such, our
   approach is not restricted to linear systems. We compare our approach
   with other falsification approaches including uniform random sampling
   and a robustness guided falsification approach used in the tool
   S-Taliro. Our preliminary evaluation clearly shows the potential of our
   approach to search for candidate trajectory segments and use them to
   find concrete property violations.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a class of local volt/var control schemes where the control
   decision on the reactive power at a bus depends only on the local bus
   voltage. These local algorithms form a feedback dynamical system and
   collectively determine the bus voltages of a power network. We show that
   the dynamical system has a unique equilibrium by interpreting the
   dynamics as a distributed algorithm for solving a certain convex
   optimization problem whose unique optimal point is the system
   equilibrium. Moreover, the objective function serves as a Lyapunov
   function implying global asymptotic stability of the equilibrium. The
   optimization based model does not only provide a way to characterize the
   equilibrium, but also suggests a principled way to engineer the control.
   We apply the results to study the parameter setting for the
   inverter-based volt/var control in the proposed IEEE 1547.8 standard.}},

   formulated as a binary integer linear program. We show that it becomes
   equivalent to a knapsack problem. We theoretically analyze the
   performance of several bandwidth allocation policies in terms of
   computation effort and throughput of the solution. The performance
   characteristics are then validated through simulation, showing that the
   greedy knapsack solution achieves within 99\% of the optimal allocation
   in less than 2\% of the computation time. The quickness of this policy
   reduces the computational complexity needed to solve the full data ferry

Abstract = {{Current laparoscopic surgeries suffer from inconvenient, limited
   visualization due to the small incisions. It normally needs an assistant
   to hold and readjust a laparoscope to view the surgical set when
   performing procedures. This assistant can be either a human or a robotic
   laparoscope holder. However, at the current state, both of them only
   passively follow the control commands from the surgeon (The human
   assistant relies on the surgeon's verbal communications and the robotic
   holder is controlled by the voice or joystick/buttons), whenever the
   laparoscope needs to be readjusted. The surgeon's explicit intervention
   in laparoscope readjustment might bring extra mental and physical
   burdens to him/her. In this paper, the work of granting
   attention-awareness to a robotic laparoscope holder is presented. The
   robot can actively observe the surgeon's viewing attention by tracking
   the surgeon's eye movements and automatically adjust the laparoscope's
   view correspondingly. Our experimental results demonstrated that this
   system effectively released the surgeon from the intervention of the
   laparoscope, which could eliminate the visualization barriers of

Abstract = {{Laparoscopic techniques provide significant advantages to patients, such
   as shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and minimal scarring.
   However, poor ergonomics in laparoscopic surgery and failure to
   understand the ergonomics of laparoscopic surgery increase the
   discomfort and fatigue of the surgeon. According to a questionnaire
   designed by SAGES (Society of American Gastrointestinal Endoscopic
   Surgeons) task force on ergonomics in 1999, a large number of
   laparoscopic surgeons suffer frequent pain of the necks, and upper
   extremities pain {[}1]. One of the critical factors that cause these
   pains is the poorly adapted operation table height. The aim of this
   study is to investigate new technical solutions from ergonomic aspect to
   reduce the stress and strain on the surgeon during laparoscopic
   procedures. This was attempted by digital human modeling and its posture
   prediction when it is integrated into the operating room (OR)
   environment. The predicted postures at different heights of the OR table
   can then be evaluated in terms of discomfort measurement, and the
   optimal solution for an ergonomic table height can be determined with
   regard to the specific individual body size. We hope that by integrating
   this digital human model into the OR ergonomic simulation, we can
   provide an alternative approach with more efficiency and less cost
   compared with conventional ergonomics studies which rely on experiments
   and questionnaires.}},

Abstract = {{The national or international mapping projects have usually long
   interval to update. To complement this long interval, satellite imagery
   obtained periodically and continuously is useful. This study is a
   preliminary step to generate annual spatial datasets comparable to the
   existing vegetation cover (EVC) layers using satellite imagery. We
   introduced and tested an approach based on 3D wavelet transform to
   analyze the multi-temporal satellite images. 3D wavelet transform based
   analysis was experimentally applied to NDVI images where identifying
   non-changed pixels. 3D wavelet transform can extract important patterns
   such as long term trends and short term events and analyze spatial and
   temporal relations with neighboring pixel. As a result, 3D wavelet
   transformed LLL values were much more stable across time than those of
   the original NDVI in non-changed areas. This study can provide
   fundamentals for image correction to ensure image comparability across
   years.}},

Abstract = {{``Nature abhors vacuum.{''} Based on theory of the zero point energy,
   broken symmetry, and tip effect, useful energy and power has been
   extracted from quantum vacuum experimentally. The experimental results
   of anomalous nuclear reaction reported by Jiang, Bockris, Miley and
   Mizuno, et al. challenge the current atomic model. It appears that there
   are situations in which nuclei split open at the stimulus only chemical
   energies. A high energy concentration in the double layer on the cathode
   surface is observed with the existence of anomalous nuclear
   transmutation in electrolytic cells. A model of vortex dynamics based on
   the zero point energy, Casimir effect and torsion field with tip-effect
   and related nonlinear processes is proposed by Xingliu Jiang to account
   for the anomalies of the experimental phenomena. The combination of
   energy vortex or particle vortex rings with abruptly pulsed bucking
   electromagnetic field or turbulence fluid could result in the direct
   manifestation of energy and matter transformation. The modification of
   the spectrum of the zero point energy by dynamic Casimir effect is
   essential for nuclear transmutation of the Fleischmann and Pons effect.
   There is reason to strive for a better understanding of the physical
   interpretation of so-called ``Cold Fusion{''}.}},

Abstract = {{Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that refers to the condition created by
   the body's inability to regulate glucose levels. It has been labelled
   the ``silent epidemic{''} for its insidious and chronic nature. The
   medical profession has postulated that patients could benefit from a
   system providing continuous glucose readings. All over the
   world-particularly in developing countries where the health sector
   experiences serious shortages-mobile phones are becoming a new platform
   to offer health services. We define the model for evaluation of mobile
   health solution to monitor diabetes and explore the influence of two
   factors on the model, the cost of a telecom service and the discount
   rate. We further evaluate the model using three countries with
   considerable burden of the disease: the USA, Brazil and India. The
   predicted explosion of diabetes in the developing parts of the world
   could be averted using mobile health solutions. In remote areas where
   healthcare workers are scarce and patients have high travel cost it
   might be the most efficient way.}},

   four types of granular activated carbon (GACs) were significantly

   remarkable level: up to 10\% by mass. Hard and soft acid/base behavior
   (HSAB), metal stability and complexation constants, benzotriazoles
   dissociation constants and point of zero charge for the carbon, as well
   as triazole precipitation on the GAC surface were attributed to the

Abstract = {{In this paper, Perzyna-type viscoplastic rate equations are integrated
   for a time step by considering the step as stress-driven. Depending on
   how the increment is imposed (constant, linear etc.), different
   strategies arise. The secant compliance is obtained by truncated
   expansion of the yield function. The viscoplastic model can be applied
   to materials exhibiting rate-dependent behavior, but it can also be used
   to recover an inviscid elastoplasticity solution when stationary
   conditions are reached. Within this framework, a viscoplastic relaxation
   iterative strategy is developed, relating the iterations with the
   fictitious time steps. Some examples of application are presented in the
   context of the Finite Element Method with zero-thickness interface
   elements for slope and stability problems with discontinuities.}},

Abstract = {{Satellite navigation traditionally uses GPS signals, or when GPS is
   unavailable, dedicated ground based signals. The use of GPS is limited
   to specific orbital regimes and has very limited availability beyond
   geosynchronous altitudes, while dedicated ground-based signals are
   expensive and specific to each mission. The use of generic terrestrially
   broadcast signals, or Signals of Opportunity, for use in satellite
   navigation has not yet been studied in great depth. This paper presents
   analysis that shows that these Signals of Opportunity are useful signals
   that can be picked up in GPS challenged environments as well as for
   deep-space orbital tracking. Furthermore, it is shown that not only are
   the signals available in these GPS challenged regimes, but they include
   many properties that allow satellite navigation in these GPS challenged
   regimes; including number of signals seen, uniqueness of each signal,
   and ability to range each signal to determine source of signal and
   ephemeris of receiver. These Signals of Opportunity present a new and
   economical method for satellite positioning, navigation, and timing in a
   wide variety of orbits out to lunar distance and beyond.}},

Abstract = {{High altitude balloon platforms offer improved accessibility for
   astronomical observatories with performance comparable to the Hubble
   Space Telescope. A requisite for such missions is an attitude
   determination system that provides an error signal with sub-arcsecond
   accuracy. Star trackers are a common solution, but none currently
   perform with the required accuracy due to atmospheric scattering during
   daytime. DayStar, a prototype star tracker designed at the University of
   Colorado at Boulder, addresses this issue with the use of red-filtered
   optics, a custom high resolution CMOS camera and efficient star
   identification algorithms. This paper discusses the modeling required to
   quantify daytime performance, and compares it to experimental data from
   DayStar's September, 2012 test flight. Both show that, despite daytime
   conditions in the stratosphere, a star tracker can operate with
   sub-arcsecond accuracy. With the capabilities that DayStar provides, a
   high altitude balloon observatory can match the image quality of Hubble
   for a fraction of the cost.}},

Abstract = {{Grounded in motivation theory, the purpose of this research is to use
   random forest analysis to identify factors of motivation of students who
   participate in a project-based learning experience. Our research aims to
   answer: 1) How does project-based service learning affect students'
   motivation as compared to conventional (non-ervice) project-based
   learning? 2) How are women affected differentially by project-based
   service-learning? The research, which began in 2011, was completed over
   a two-year period. The students and activities in Component Design, an
   existing junior-level course at the University of Colorado at Boulder
   served as the research focus. Specifically, project-based
   service-learning curriculum was implemented into a required design and
   build activity for Component Design students. Using a conventional
   design project as the control, how the context of project-based service
   learning affects aspects of student motivation was studied.
   This paper discusses the research design, theoretical framework, data
   analysis methods, and random forest results. Our findings indicate that
   students' initial non-technical skills were the most important predictor
   of motivation in the conventional project-based learning experience and
   that students' perceived value of the course and the project were the
   most important predictors of motivation in the project-based
   service-learning experience.}},

Abstract = {{The DeepCwind consortium is a group of universities, national labs, and
   companies funded under a research initiative by the U.S. Department of
   Energy (DOE) to support the research and development of floating
   offshore wind power. The two main objectives of the project are to
   better understand the complex dynamic behavior of floating offshore wind
   systems and to create experimental data for use in validating the tools
   used in modeling these systems. In support of these objectives, the
   DeepCwind consortium conducted a model test campaign in 2011 of three
   generic floating wind systems: a tension-leg platform (TLP), a spar-buoy
   (spar), and a semi-submersible (semi). Each of the three platforms was
   designed to support a 1/50th-scale model of a 5-MW wind turbine and was
   tested under a variety of wind/wave conditions.
   The focus of this paper is to summarize the work done by consortium
   members in analyzing the data obtained from the test campaign and its
   use for validating the offshore wind modeling tool, FAST.}},

   electronic properties and their extensive use as components in
   optoelectronic, and potentially in thermoelectric, devices. In this
   paper, an elaborate study is presented on silicon thin films ranging
   from a few nanometers in thickness to very thick bulk-like thicknesses.
   Full lattice dynamics calculations are performed incorporating the
   entire film cross section and the relaxation of the free surfaces. The
   phonon properties emerging from these calculations are then incorporated
   into Holland-Callaway models to predict the thermal conductivity and
   other phonon transport properties. A rigorous curve fitting process to a
   limited set of available experimental data is carried out to obtain the
   scattering lifetimes. Our results demonstrate the importance of proper
   consideration of the full thin-film dispersion description and provide
   insights into the relationship between thermal conductivity, film
   thickness and temperature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the use of a VoIP communication service running on
   a Wi-Fi-based network in the Peruvian Rainforest to enable a cooperative
   network among producers, buyers and transporters of agricultural
   products. As a result, uncertainties in a geographically isolated
   imperfect agricultural market will be reduced, leading to a more
   efficient use of scarce resources, an increase of farmers' incomes, and
   more competitive prices of products in urban markets. This project
   involves enabling access to agricultural product information from buyers
   in urban areas to farmers in rural villages, as well as transporters and
   middlemen. The deployment of the Wi-Fi network began in 2007. This
   network, a 445 km long Wi-Fi Long Distance-based network, was deployed
   by the Rural Telecommunications Research Group and the Spanish-Americas
   Health Link (EHAS) Foundation to support telemedicine programs. The
   deployed network and excess bandwidth makes it possible to continue
   promoting development in this area by allowing coexistence with other
   services such as the proposed VoIP enabled cooperative network for
   commerce of agricultural products. To achieve this end, challenges
   include: 1) designing an appropriate framework to enable the cooperative
   network among participants, 2) designing appropriate friendly enduser
   technology for first-time technology users, and 3) designing an
   appropriate business model which ensures a sustainable growing service.
   Using the VoIP service as a tool to enable affordable communication for
   this agricultural initiative will allow interaction among producers,
   buyers and transporters located hundreds of kilometers apart and open
   unprecedented choices for them to offer and trade products, generating
   innovative practices tailored for the local conditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigated the weaknesses of using the cannonball model to
   represent the solar radiation pressure force on an object in an orbit
   determination filter. These weaknesses are rooted in the fact that the
   cannonball model is not a good representation of the true solar
   radiation pressure force acting on an object. Using unrealistic dynamics
   in a filter causes four distinct issues: first, the state estimate will
   be incorrect; second, predictions made from this estimate, with the
   improper force model, will be very inaccurate; third, the covariance
   reported by the filter will be unrealistic; and fourth, long and/or
   dense arcs of data can't be fit. These issues are illustrated through
   numerical examples of one of the GRACE satellites in low-Earth orbit,
   and more drastically for a piece of high area-to-mass ratio debris in a
   near GEO orbit.
   The results shown in this paper present a strong case that the
   cannonball model is not sufficient for accurately tracking HAMR debris
   objects. An improved SRP model, however, would greatly improve catalog
   maintenance issues. An accurate force model allows for precise orbit
   determination with realistic covariance bounds, and most importantly
   allows these estimates to be propagated such that the covariance
   realistically contains the object in the future. This is a necessity for
   proper track correlation and object identification. Finally, an accurate
   force model allows longer and more dense arcs of data to be used to
   maintain catalog entries.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific interest in small solar system bodies has been growing
   significantly during the last decade, with a number of mission studies,
   actual missions, and planned future missions in the works. In order to
   support the close proximity operations of the mission it is necessary to
   develop an accurate gravity field valid to the surface. One way to
   construct an accurate gravity field model is to assume that the body
   density is homogeneous and compute the potential/acceleration of the
   spacecraft by shape model integration. However, for a majority of
   asteroid, this homogeneous density assumption may not be suitable, and
   the measured gravity field from orbit determination process often
   differs from that generated by shape model integration. In this paper,
   we investigate the discrepancies between the measured gravity field and
   the gravity field generated by homogeneous density assumption. Using
   this difference, we can constrain the internal density distribution of
   an asteroid, which motivates a generalized density estimation approach
   to recover a representation of the true density distribution of the
   body.}},

Abstract = {{A description of an attitude control system for a 3-axis stabilized
   spacecraft is presented. Using modified Rodrigues parameters, a globally
   stabilizing nonlinear feedback control law is derived that enables
   tracking of an arbitrary, time-varying reference attitude. This new
   control incorporates integral feedback while avoiding any quadratic rate
   feedback components. A redundant cluster of four reaction wheels is used
   to control the spacecraft attitude, and three magnetic torque rods are
   used for purposes of continuous autonomous momentum dumping. The
   momentum dumping strategy can employ general torque rod orientations,
   and is developed to take advantage of a redundant set of reaction
   wheels.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a semi-analytic approach for optimal spacecraft
   formation keeping with high precision. For a continuous-thrust
   propulsion system, a nonlinear optimal tracking law is derived in
   generic form as an explicit function of the states by employing
   generating functions in the theory of Hamiltonian systems. Optimal
   formation keeping problems are formulated with respect to a time-varying
   reference trajectory on a finite time span to accommodate nonlinearities
   more precisely. The applicability of the overall process is not affected
   by the complexity of dynamics and the selection of coordinates. As it
   allows us to design a nonlinear optimal feedback control in the
   Earth-centered inertial frame, a variety of nonlinear perturbations can
   be incorporated without complicated coordinate transformations.
   Numerical experiments demonstrate that the nonlinear tracking control
   logic results in superior tracking accuracy and cost reduction by
   accommodating higher-order nonlinearities.}},

   solar radiation pressure (SRP) dominated environment is analyzed. A
   previously derived solution for the secular motion of an orbiter in this
   environment is restated and studied in detail for application to the
   orbital phase of NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission to asteroid 1999 RQ36. Using
   the secular solution we are able to carry out a nominal design of the
   orbit phase with constraints on the oscillations expected in the orbit
   elements and spacecraft orbit geometry. We also probe the limits of the
   secular solution, and show that low orbits are sufficiently perturbed by
   the asteroid gravity field to destabilize certain classes of orbits. The
   analytical averaged solutions are validated with numerical integrations
   and through implementation in Satellite ToolKit (STK).}},

Abstract = {{This article provides a methodology to assess the infrastructure
   sustainability of the Grand Canal of China using a systems approach
   based on historic-geographic data. By taking a retrospective view over a
   significant historical period, it is possible to assess the usefulness
   of current modern sustainability measures (SMs) as reasonable
   predictors. The temporal focus of this article is between 1770 and 1870,
   while the geographic focus is on Huai'an, Jiangsu province. The period
   and region selected for study were key for the changing utilisation and
   viability of the canal. An infrastructure sustainability indicator (ISI)
   for the Grand Canal is introduced, based on three SMs: economic,
   environmental and social/political. Each of these measures consists
   itself of two or three underlying indices. Variations of the ISI over
   the period from 1770 to 1870 are reviewed in the context of the
   historical events in China during the eighteenth and nineteenth
   centuries. This article demonstrates that the concept of infrastructure
   sustainability assessment can indeed be extended back into history,
   although proper assumptions need to be made. Only through such a
   retrospective approach can the true sustainability be verified. It is
   clear that the particular quantities are unique to this study, but the
   methodology and concept contains useful lessons for the sustainability
   modelling of modern infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{Building sustainability assessments are driving greater market demand
   for sustainable buildings in the developed world. However, do such
   assessments actually demonstrate building sustainability? Some critics
   of building sustainability assessment argue that the methods should
   evolve toward an ``absolute{''} assessment of building sustainability.
   That is, rather than assessing a building relative to a average
   like-type building as is typically done, the assessment should be made
   to whatever is deemed sustainable using a credible science. One possible
   form of absolute assessment is using the indicator of sustainability
   known as carrying capacity. After discussing the opportunities with a
   carrying-capacity-based assessment of buildings, this paper proposes a
   computational model that provides such an assessment.
   There are four main components to the presented computational model. The
   first is the amount of carbon (C) stored on the building site in its
   native state. This native-site carbon storage is defined as the baseline
   carbon storage and represents the carrying capacity of the building
   project. The second is land use change, which accounts for the removal
   or addition of vegetation and other carbon storing elements to the
   project site. The third and fourth carbon emissions sources in the model
   are building construction and operation.
   A building is considered sustainable in the model if by the end of its
   expected lifetime the total amount of carbon emissions are completely
   offset. Building designers and their clients can use this model to more
   comprehensively account for carbon emissions and identify options for
   reducing and offsetting them. To drive greater adoption, the model has
   been developed into an online resource, Green Footstep (www.
   greenfootstep.org).
   To demonstrate the usefulness of the model, this paper presents a case
   study of an institutional building in Lake Placid, Florida, USA. The
   case study shows that the design team used the model to better
   understand what it means to have a ``low-carbon{''} goal. The model
   showed them that over one hundred years, the building project must
   reduce and offset carbon emissions at a rate of 16 tonnes C per year.

Abstract = {{We use coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations of blends of generic
   conjugated polymers and acceptor molecules to show how architecture
   (e.g., side chains, backbone flexibility of oligomers) and the pair-wise
   interactions between the constituents of the blend affect morphology and
   phase transition. Alkyl side chains on the conjugated oligomer backbones
   shift the liquid crystal (LC) transition temperature from that of bare
   conjugated backbones and the direction of the shift depends on
   backbonebackbone interactions. Rigid backbones and constrained side
   chains cause a layer-by-layer morphology of conjugated polymers and
   amorphous acceptors, whereas flexible backbones and unconstrained side
   chains facilitate highly ordered acceptor arrangement. Strong
   backbonebackbone attraction shifts LC transition to higher temperatures
   than weak backbonebackbone attraction, and strong acceptoracceptor
   attraction increases acceptor aggregation. Pure macro-phase separated
   domains form when all pair-wise interactions in the blend are strongly
   attractive, whereas interconnected domains form at intermediate
   acceptoracceptor attraction and strong polymerpolymer attractions. (C)

   absorption}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{DEC 29}},
Abstract = {{Arctic sea ice has declined and become thinner and younger (more
   seasonal) during the last decade. One consequence of this is that the
   surface energy budget of the Arctic Ocean is changing. While the role of
   surface albedo has been studied intensively, it is still widely unknown
   how much light penetrates through sea ice into the upper ocean,
   affecting seaice mass balance, ecosystems, and geochemical processes.
   Here we present the first large-scale under-ice light measurements,
   operating spectral radiometers on a remotely operated vehicle (ROV)
   under Arctic sea ice in summer. This data set is used to produce an
   Arctic-wide map of light distribution under summer sea ice. Our results
   show that transmittance through first-year ice (FYI, 0.11) was almost
   three times larger than through multi-year ice (MYI, 0.04), and that
   this is mostly caused by the larger melt-pond coverage of FYI (42 vs.
   23\%). Also energy absorption was 50\% larger in FYI than in MYI. Thus,
   a continuation of the observed sea-ice changes will increase the amount
   of light penetrating into the Arctic Ocean, enhancing sea-ice melt and
   affecting sea-ice and upper-ocean ecosystems. Citation: Nicolaus, M., C.

Title = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in urban air: How chemistry affects
   the interpretation of positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were measured online at an urban site
   in Beijing in August-September 2010. Diurnal variations of various VOC
   species indicate that VOCs concentrations were influenced by
   photochemical removal with OH radicals for reactive species and
   secondary formation for oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs). A photochemical
   age-based parameterization method was applied to characterize VOCs
   chemistry. A large part of the variability in concentrations of both
   hydrocarbons and OVOCs was explained by this method. The determined
   emission ratios of hydrocarbons to acetylene agreed within a factor of
   two between 2005 and 2010 measurements. However, large differences were
   found for emission ratios of some alkanes and C8 aromatics between
   Beijing and northeastern United States secondary formation from
   anthropogenic VOCs generally contributed higher percentages to
   concentrations of reactive aldehydes than those of inert ketones and
   alcohols. Anthropogenic primary emissions accounted for the majority of
   ketones and alcohols concentrations. Positive matrix factorization (PMF)
   was also used to identify emission sources from this VOCs data set. The
   four resolved factors were three anthropogenic factors and a biogenic
   factor. However, the anthropogenic factors are attributed here to a
   common source at different stages of photochemical processing rather
   than three independent sources. Anthropogenic and biogenic sources of
   VOCs concentrations were not separated completely in PMF. This study
   indicates that photochemistry of VOCs in the atmosphere complicates the
   information about separated sources that can be extracted from PMF and
   the influence of photochemical processing must be carefully considered
   in the interpretation of source apportionment studies based upon PMF.}},

Title = {{Optical dielectric function of gold}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{In metal optics gold assumes a special status because of its practical
   importance in optoelectronic and nano-optical devices, and its role as a
   model system for the study of the elementary electronic excitations that
   underlie the interaction of electromagnetic fields with metals. However,
   largely inconsistent values for the frequency dependence of the
   dielectric function describing the optical response of gold are found in
   the literature. We performed precise spectroscopic ellipsometry
   measurements on evaporated gold, template-stripped gold, and
   single-crystal gold to determine the optical dielectric function across
   a broad spectral range from 300 nm to 25 mu m (0.05-4.14 eV) with high
   spectral resolution. We fit the data to the Drude free-electron model,
   with an electron relaxation time tau(D) = 14 +/- 3 fs and plasma energy
   h omega(p) = 8.45 eV. We find that the variation in dielectric functions
   for the different types of samples is small compared to the range of
   values reported in the literature. Our values, however, are comparable
   to the aggregate mean of the collection of previous measurements from
   over the past six decades. This suggests that although some variation
   can be attributed to surface morphology, the past measurements using
   different approaches seem to have been plagued more by systematic errors
   than previously assumed. DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235147}},

Abstract = {{A new diepoxide monomer (ADTDE) containing an allylic dithioether moiety
   has been synthesized to extend the suite of monomers that form networks
   exhibiting radical-mediated photoplasticity. These cross-linked polymers
   show permanent shape change under load and stress relax only when under
   the stimulus of visible or UV radiation. The Lewis base-catalyzed
   reaction of the epoxide groups in ADTDE with tri- and tetrafunctional
   thiols was monitored by differential scanning calorimetry and infrared
   spectroscopy. These curing systems were found to be more efficient than
   anionic, cationic, or anhydride polymerizations. The dynamic mechanical
   thermal analysis of ADTDE with the tetrathiol showed that the network
   was rubbery at room temperature which is considered ideal for the
   demonstration of photoplasticity. The photoinduced creep behavior was
   shown to be controlled by the presence of active free radicals in the
   matrix-on cessation of irradiation, the creep was terminated. The stress
   relaxation of the stretched network specimens during UV irradiation was
   studied and was found to be similar to that shown previously for
   thiol-vinyl ether networks. As expected, the cross-link density of
   networks prepared from ADTDE with the trithiol was lower than that
   formed with the tetrathiol and this was found to have a significant
   influence on the rate and extent of photoplasticity observed-the less
   highly cross-linked ADTDE/trithiol system exhibited more rapid and more
   extensive photoplasticity since it contained fewer network strands.}},

Abstract = {{The Higgs boson was postulated nearly five decades ago within the
   framework of the standard model of particle physics and has been the
   subject of numerous searches at accelerators around the world. Its
   discovery would verify the existence of a complex scalar field thought
   to give mass to three of the carriers of the electroweak force-the W+,
   W-, and Z(0) bosons-as well as to the fundamental quarks and leptons.
   The CMS Collaboration has observed, with a statistical significance of
   five standard deviations, a new particle produced in proton-proton
   collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. The evidence is
   strongest in the diphoton and four-lepton (electrons and/or muons) final
   states, which provide the best mass resolution in the CMS detector. The
   probability of the observed signal being due to a random fluctuation of
   the background is about 1 in 3 x 10(6). The new particle is a boson with
   spin not equal to 1 and has a mass of about 1.25 giga-electron volts.
   Although its measured properties are, within the uncertainties of the
   present data, consistent with those expected of the Higgs boson, more
   data are needed to elucidate the precise nature of the new particle.}},

Abstract = {{3D structures are written and developed in a crosslinked polymer
   initially formed by a DielsAlder reaction. Unlike conventional liquid
   resists, small features cannot sediment, as the reversible crosslinks
   function as a support, and the modulus of the material is in the MPa
   range at room temperature. The support structure, however, can be easily
   removed by heating the material, and depolymerizing the polymer into a
   mixture of low-viscosity monomers. Complex shapes are written into the
   polymer network using two-photon techniques to spatially control the
   photoinitiation and subsequent thiolene reaction to selectively convert
   the DielsAlder adducts into irreversible crosslinks.}},

Abstract = {{The adjoints of the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model and a
   comprehensive cloud droplet parameterization are coupled to study the
   sensitivity of cloud droplet number concentration (N-d) over US regions
   and Central Europe to global emissions of anthropogenic fine mode
   aerosol precursors. Simulations reveal that the N-d over the midwestern
   and southeastern US is mostly sensitive to SO2 emissions during August,
   and to NH3 emissions during February. Over the western US, N-d is mostly
   sensitivity to SO2 and primary organic aerosol emissions. In Central
   Europe, N-d is most sensitive to NH3 and NOx emissions. As expected,
   local emissions strongly affect N-d; long-range transport, however, is
   also important for the western US and Europe. Emissions changes
   projected for the year 2050 are estimated to have the largest impacts on
   cloud albedo and N-d over Central Europe during August (42\% and 82\%
   change, respectively) and western US during February (12\% and 36.5\%

Title = {{Thermal ghost imaging with averaged speckle patterns}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 17}},
Abstract = {{We present theoretical and experimental results showing that a thermal
   ghost imaging system can produce images of high quality even when it
   uses detectors so slow that they respond only to intensity-averaged
   (that is, ``blurred{''}) speckle patterns, as long as the collected
   signal variation is predominantly caused by the random fluctuation of
   the incident speckle field rather than other noise sources. In our
   experimental study, we show that the quality of the ghost image is not
   degraded when as many as 25 speckle patterns are averaged together for
   each measurement. This surprising result comes from the fact that the
   averaging of speckle patterns leads to a decrease in the contrast but
   not in the kurtosis, and the image quality of a ghost imaging system is
   dependent on the kurtosis rather than the contrast ratio of the
   illuminating field. These results suggest that a broad class of imaging
   systems based on the use of speckle techniques can be implemented even
   using detectors that respond slowly on the time scale of the fluctuating
   speckle pattern. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevA.86.063817}},

   and the geomagnetic field}},
Journal = {{EARTH AND PLANETARY SCIENCE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{359}},
Pages = {{55-60}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Here we investigate the effects of fluid properties on the morphology
   and dynamics of convection in the Earth's outer core. The results of two
   quasi-geostrophic convection simulations are carried out at comparable
   convective velocities for fluids in which the ratio between the
   kinematic viscosity and thermal diffusivity (the Prandtl number, Pr) is
   0.1 and 10. The Pr = 0.1 case is representative of thermal convection in
   a liquid metal, whereas the Pr = 10 case is representative of chemical
   convection. We find the influence of the Prandtl number to be
   significant; low Prandtl number fluids have a propensity for large-scale
   coherent vortex formation and slowly varying dynamics. Conversely, the
   high Prandtl case is dominated by significantly smaller length scales
   and more rapidly varying dynamics. However, both cases have zonal flows
   with similar strength, demonstrating that Reynolds stresses in high
   Prandtl number convection can be large when the buoyancy forcing is
   strong. By using a simple kinematic magnetic induction model we show
   that the structure of the magnetic field is not a direct indication of
   the underlying convective morphology when the magnetic diffusivity is
   large, as in Earth's core. Thus, our simulation results imply that the
   convective turbulence differs between thermally and chemically dominated
   convection, but that it may be difficult to determine the dominant
   forcing from geomagnetic field structure alone. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Lunar tide amplification during the January 2009 stratosphere warming
   event: Observations and theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Amplification of the lunar gravitational M-2 and N-2 tides during the
   January 2009 sudden stratosphere warming (SSW) event are explored using
   SABER temperature data at 110 km, CHAMP and GRACE densities at 360 and
   480 km, and the Global-Scale Wave Model (GSWM). Utilizing background
   temperatures and winds characteristic of individual days during January
   and February 2009 the GSWM is used to establish the frequency response
   of the atmosphere and its dependence on the zonal mean atmospheric
   state, and to provide daily estimates of the steady state response to
   lunar gravitational forcing. SABER M-2 temperature amplitudes are found
   to achieve values of order 10-15 K at 110 km, roughy 5 days after the
   peak warming at 10 hPa (day 23 of 2009), and represent a factor of 3 or
   so amplification over January climatological values. This amplification
   is attributable to a shifting of the so-called Pekeris resonance peak of
   the atmosphere to 12.42 hours (the M (2) period) due to changes in the
   zonal mean wind distribution in connection with the SSW. N-2 responses
   of order 4-6 K are similarly found near days 25 and 40, when the Pekeris
   peak passes near to 12.66 hours (the N-2 period). The GSWM predicts
   temperature perturbations of order 20-30 K for M-2 and 3-4 K for N-2,
   reasonably consistent with the above results, given nuances of the data
   analysis and recognized shortcomings of utilizing a steady state model.
   An enhanced M-2 density response of order 15-20\% is found in the CHAMP
   measurements between days 30 and 40, as compared with a GSWM estimate of
   order 10\%. The upper thermosphere N-2 response could not be extracted
   from CHAMP measurements, and both M-2 and N-2 response determinations
   using the GRACE data were deemed unreliable. The GSWM estimates lunar
   tidal wind responses of order 40-60 ms(-1) in the dynamo region (ca.
   100-150 km) in connection with the SSW. These constitute large
   perturbations to the nominal tidal winds at these altitudes, and are
   thus expected to carry the lunar tide signature into the ionosphere
   vis-a-vis dynamo electric fields, consistent with observations and
   interpretations made in the recent literature. Citation: Forbes, J. M.,

Title = {{Fouling phenomena during membrane filtration of microalgae}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{423}},
Pages = {{33-42}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{Harvesting of secreted fuel precursors is an alternative approach to
   sustainable biofuel production from algae, and relies on selective
   separation of growth media from algal suspensions. Membrane fouling and
   species fractionation for selected ultrafiltration (UF) and
   microfiltration (MF) membranes were investigated for this purpose.
   Suspensions were filtered using total recycle, flux-stepping protocols
   to measure fouling rates and subsequent fouling reversibility. Severe
   fouling was observed at high flux values for 50 kg/mol UF and 0.22 mu m
   MF membranes, with much of the fouling irreversible. In contrast, a 5 mu
   m MF membrane showed essentially no increase in resistance, even though
   the whole algal cells were rejected to form a cake on the membrane
   surface. Analysis of the permeate from the 5 mu m MF filtration
   indicated the presence of ``protein-like{''}, ``humic-like{''}, and
   high-molecular-mass polymeric materials, as well as submicron particles.
   However, model solutions of dissolved organic material showed very low
   fouling compared to the as-grown algal suspensions. Instead, submicron
   particles present in the algal suspensions and in the 5 mu m MF permeate
   are thought to be the primary foulants by forming high-resistance cakes
   on the UF and 0.22 mu m MF membranes and also by plugging the pores of
   0.22 mu m MF membranes. Thus, the flux decline and lack of ``easy{''}
   reversibility for our algal suspensions, filtered on specific membranes,
   appears to be primarily associated with deposition of smaller colloidal
   species within the membrane and/or near its surface, rather than with
   macromolecules or a cake of whole algal cells. Furthermore, membrane
   characteristics similar to those of the 5 mu m MF membrane employed may
   offer a unique strategy for separation of these undesirable particulate
   materials from healthy cultures of algae with large-enough size. (c)

Title = {{Impact of tidal density variability on orbital and reentry predictions}},
Journal = {{SPACE WEATHER-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Since the first satellites entered Earth orbit in the late 1950's and
   early 1960's, the influences of solar and geomagnetic variability on the
   satellite drag environment have been studied, and parameterized in
   empirical density models with increasing sophistication. However, only
   within the past 5 years has the realization emerged that ``troposphere
   weather{''} contributes significantly to the ``space weather{''} of the
   thermosphere, especially during solar minimum conditions. Much of the
   attendant variability is attributable to upward-propagating solar tides
   excited by latent heating due to deep tropical convection, and solar
   radiation absorption primarily by water vapor and ozone in the
   stratosphere and mesosphere, respectively. We know that this tidal
   spectrum significantly modifies the orbital (>200 km) and reentry
   (60-150 km) drag environments, and that these tidal components induce
   longitude variability not yet emulated in empirical density models. Yet,
   current requirements for improvements in orbital prediction make clear
   that further refinements to density models are needed. In this paper,
   the operational consequences of longitude-dependent tides are
   quantitatively assessed through a series of orbital and reentry
   predictions. We find that in-track prediction differences incurred by
   tidal effects are typically of order 200 +/- 100 m for satellites in
   400-km circular orbits and 15 +/- 10 km for satellites in 200-km
   circular orbits for a 24-hour prediction. For an initial 200-km circular
   orbit, surface impact differences of order 15 degrees +/- 15 degrees
   latitude are incurred. For operational problems with similar accuracy
   needs, a density model that includes a climatological representation of
   longitude-dependent tides should significantly reduce errors due to this
   source. Citation: Leonard, J. M., J. M. Forbes, and G. H. Born (2012),

   quarks produced in d + Au and p + p collisions at root S-NN = 200 GeV in

   + Au collisions, the nuclear modification factor R-dA at 1.5 < p(T) < 5
   GeV/c displays evidence of enhancement of these electrons, relative to
   those produced in p + p collisions, and shows that the mass-dependent
   Cronin enhancement observed at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider
   extends to the heavy D meson family. A comparison with the neutral-pion
   data suggests that the difference in cold-nuclear-matter effects on
   light- and heavy-flavor mesons could contribute to the observed
   differences between the pi(0) and heavy-flavor-electron nuclear
   modification factors R-AA. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.109.242301}},

Abstract = {{Detailed airborne, surface, and subsurface chemical measurements,
   primarily obtained in May and June 2010, are used to quantify initial
   hydrocarbon compositions along different transport pathways (i.e., in
   deep subsurface plumes, in the initial surface slick, and in the
   atmosphere) during the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Atmospheric
   measurements are consistent with a limited area of surfacing oil, with
   implications for leaked hydrocarbon mass transport and oil drop size
   distributions. The chemical data further suggest relatively little
   variation in leaking hydrocarbon composition over time. Although readily
   soluble hydrocarbons made up similar to 25\% of the leaking mixture by
   mass, subsurface chemical data show these compounds made up similar to
   69\% of the deep plume mass; only similar to 31\% of the deep plume mass
   was initially transported in the form of trapped oil droplets. Mass
   flows along individual transport pathways are also derived from
   atmospheric and subsurface chemical data. Subsurface hydrocarbon
   composition, dissolved oxygen, and dispersant data are used to assess
   release of hydrocarbons from the leaking well. We use the chemical
   measurements to estimate that (7.8 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) kg of hydrocarbons
   leaked on June 10, 2010, directly accounting for roughly three-quarters
   of the total leaked mass on that day. The average environmental release
   rate of (10.1 +/- 2.0) x 10(6) kg/d derived using atmospheric and
   subsurface chemical data agrees within uncertainties with the official
   average leak rate of (10.2 +/- 1.0) x 10(6) kg/d derived using physical
   and optical methods.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) were prepared from a novel two-tailed
   partially fluorinated thiol (F8C11/C16), possessing one hydrocarbon
   chain and one chain with an extended fluorinated segment, and from
   mixtures of F8C11/C16 and hexadecanethiol (C16) on gold, with the
   expectation that the internal chemical dissimilarity and wedgelike shape
   of F8C11/C16 would lead to unique self-organizational motifs. The SAMs
   were systematically characterized using ellipsometry, atomic force
   microscopy (AFM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), contact angle
   goniometry, and polarization modulation infrared reflection-absorption
   spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS). Based on this characterization, the
   one-component F8C11/C16 SAMs exhibited relatively poor molecular
   organization compared to traditional alkanethiols, forming low coverage
   monolayers with significant molecular disorder. However, the series of
   mixed SAMs formed from F8C11 and F8C11/C16 were anomalously well ordered
   as indicated by film thickness, surface coverage, and the frequencies of
   characteristic vibrational modes. AFM images of these mixed SAMs
   exhibited nanoscale fibrillar structures in a birds-nest morphology,
   suggesting that in the presence of a C16 matrix, the F8C11/C16 component
   organized into the two-dimensional analogue of discrete bilayers.
   Control experiments involving mixed SAMs comprised of F8C11/C16 and a
   single-tailed partially fluorinated thiol (F8C11) or C16 and F8C11
   exhibited no appreciable indication of interesting self-organization
   beyond an evenly dispersed mixing of the thiolates or phase separation,
   respectively.}},

Title = {{Angle-resolved photoemission and quasiparticle calculation of ZnO: The
   need for d band shift in oxide semiconductors}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 11}},
Abstract = {{ZnO is a prototypical semiconductor with occupied d(10) bands that
   interact with the anion p states and is thus challenging for electronic
   structure theories. Within the context of these theories, incomplete
   cancellation of the self-interaction energy results in a Zn d band that
   is too high in energy, resulting in upwards repulsion of the valence
   band maximum (VBM) states, and an unphysical reduction of the band gap.
   Methods such as GW should significantly reduce the self-interaction
   error, and in order to evaluate such calculations, we measured
   high-resolution and resonant angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy
   (ARPES) and compared these to several electronic structure calculations.
   We find that, in a standard GW calculation, the d bands remain too high
   in energy by more than 1 eV irrespective of the Hamiltonian used for
   generating the input wave functions, causing a slight underestimation of
   the band gap due to the p-d repulsion. We show that a good agreement

Abstract = {{The Enskog kinetic theory is used as a starting point to model a
   suspension of solid particles in a viscous gas. Unlike previous efforts
   for similar suspensions, the gas-phase contribution to the instantaneous
   particle acceleration appearing in the Enskog equation is modelled using
   a Langevin equation, which can be applied to a wide parameter space (e.
   g. high Reynolds number). Attention here is limited to low Reynolds
   number flow, however, in order to assess the influence of the gas phase
   on the constitutive relations, which was assumed to be negligible in a
   previous analytical treatment. The Chapman-Enskog method is used to
   derive the constitutive relations needed for the conservation of mass,
   momentum and granular energy. The results indicate that the Langevin
   model for instantaneous gas-solid force matches the form of the previous
   analytical treatment, indicating the promise of this method for regions
   of the parameter space outside of those attainable by analytical methods
   (e. g. higher Reynolds number). The results also indicate that the
   effect of the gas phase on the constitutive relations for the
   solid-phase shear viscosity and Dufour coefficient is non-negligible,
   particularly in relatively dilute systems. Moreover, unlike their
   granular (no gas phase) counterparts, the shear viscosity in gas-solid
   systems is found to be zero in the dilute limit and the Dufour
   coefficient is found to be non-zero in the elastic limit.}},

Title = {{Airborne observations of methane emissions from rice cultivation in the
   Sacramento Valley of California}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{DEC 8}},
Abstract = {{Airborne measurements of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) were
   taken over the rice growing region of California's Sacramento Valley in
   the late spring of 2010 and 2011. From these and ancillary measurements,
   we show that CH4 mixing ratios were higher in the planetary boundary
   layer above the Sacramento Valley during the rice growing season than
   they were before it, which we attribute to emissions from rice paddies.
   We derive daytime emission fluxes of CH4 between 0.6 and 2.0\% of the
   CO2 taken up by photosynthesis on a per carbon, or mole to mole, basis.
   We also use a mixing model to determine an average CH4/CO2 flux ratio of
   -0.6\% for one day early in the growing season of 2010. We conclude the
   CH4/CO2 flux ratio estimates from a single rice field in a previous
   study are representative of rice fields in the Sacramento Valley. If
   generally true, the California Air Resources Board (CARB) greenhouse gas
   inventory emission rate of 2.7 x 10(10) g CH4/yr is approximately three
   times lower than the range of probable CH4 emissions (7.8-9.3 x 10(10) g
   CH4/yr) from rice cultivation derived in this study. We attribute this
   difference to decreased burning of the residual rice crop since 1991,
   which leads to an increase in CH4 emissions from rice paddies in
   succeeding years, but which is not accounted for in the CARB inventory.

Title = {{Simulated Siberian snow cover response to observed Arctic sea ice loss,
   1979-2008}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{The loss of Arctic sea ice has wide-ranging impacts, some of which are
   readily apparent and some of which remain obscure. For example, recent
   observational studies suggest that terrestrial snow cover may be
   affected by decreasing sea ice. Here, we examine a possible causal link
   between Arctic sea ice and Siberian snow cover during the past 3 decades
   using a suite of experiments with the National Center for Atmospheric
   Research Community Atmospheric Model version 3. The experiments were
   designed to isolate the influence of surface conditions within the
   Arctic Ocean from other forcing agents such as low-latitude sea surface
   temperatures and direct radiative effects of increasing greenhouse
   gases. Only those experiments that include the observed evolution of
   Arctic sea ice and sea surface temperatures result in increased snow
   depth over Siberia, while those that maintain climatological values for
   Arctic Ocean conditions result in no snow signal over Siberia. In the
   former, Siberian precipitation and air temperature both increase, but
   because surface air temperatures remain below freezing during most
   months, the snowpack thickens over this region. These results suggest
   that Arctic Ocean surface forcing is necessary and sufficient to induce
   a Siberian snow signal, and that other forcings in combination can
   modulate the strength and geographic extent of the response. Citation:

Abstract = {{A dual-polarization lidar and photography are used to sense internal
   waves in West Sound, Orcas Island, Washington, from a small aircraft.
   The airborne lidar detected a thin plankton layer at the bottom of the
   upper layer of the water, and this signal provides the depth of the
   upper layer, amplitude of the internal waves, and the propagation speed.
   The lidar is most effective when the polarization filter on the receiver
   is orthogonal to the transmitted light, but this does not depend
   significantly on whether the transmitted light is linearly or circularly
   polarized. The depolarization is greater with circular polarization, and
   our results are consistent with a single parameter Mueller scattering
   matrix. Photographs of the surface manifestation of the internal waves
   clearly show the propagation direction and width of the phase fronts of
   the internal waves, even though the contrast is low (2\%). Combined with
   the lidar profile, the total energy of the internal wave packet was
   estimated to be 9 MJ. (C) 2012 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{405-416}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Governments have attempted to advance alternative fuels (AFs) in the
   on-road transportation sector with the goal of addressing multiple
   environmental, energy security, economic growth, and technology
   transition objectives. However there is little agreement, at all
   governmental levels, on how to prioritize goals and how to measure
   progress towards goals. Literature suggests that a consistent, aligned,
   and prioritized approach will increase the effectiveness of deployment
   efforts. While literature states that goal alignment and prioritization
   should occur, there are few studies suggesting how to measure the
   alignment of deployment programs. This paper presents a methodology for
   measuring goal alignment by applying the theories of goal ambiguity. It
   then demonstrates this methodology within the context of fuel- and
   project-neutral (wide-scope) grant programs directed toward AF
   deployment. This paper analyzes forty-seven (47) wide-scope federal,
   state, and regional grant programs in the United States, active between
   2006 and 2011. On the whole, governments most use deployment grant
   programs to address environmental concerns and are highly aligned in
   doing so between agency levels. In contrast, there is much less
   consensus (and therefore goal alignment) on whether or how governments
   should address other priorities such as energy security, economic
   growth, and technology transition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In the present paper a new model is proposed for electric double layer
   (EDL) overlapped in nanochannels. The model aimed to obtain a deeper
   insight of transport phenomena in nanoscale. Two-dimensional Nernst and
   ionic conservation equations are used to obtain electroosmotic potential
   distribution in flow field. In the proposed study, transport equations
   for flow, ionic concentration and electroosnnotic potential are solved
   numerically via finite volume method. Moreover, Debye-Huckle
   approximation and symmetry condition, which limit the application, are
   avoided. Thus, the present model is suitable for prediction of
   electroosmotic flows through nanochannels as well as complicated
   asymmetric geometries with large nonuniform zeta potential distribution.
   For homogeneous zeta potential distribution, it has been shown that by
   reduction of channels height to values comparable with EDL thickness,
   Poisson Boltzmann model produces inaccurate results and must be avoided.
   Furthermore, for overlapped electric double layer in nanochannels with
   heterogeneous zeta potential distribution it has been found that the
   present model returns modified ionic concentration and electroosmotic
   potential distribution compare to previous EDL overlapped models due to
   completely 2D solution of ionic concentration distribution. Finally,
   velocity profiles in EDL overlapped nanochannels are investigated and it
   has been showed that for pure electroosmotic flow the velocity profile
   deviates from the plug-like profile towards a parabolic profile. In
   addition, it has been shown that the modified model predicts lower
   velocity in comparison with previous EDL models.}},

   capability. Moreover, they feature a larger bandwidth and a smaller

Abstract = {{This paper presents a theoretical analysis of harmonically terminated
   high-efficiency power rectifiers and experimental validation on a
   class-C single Schottky-diode rectifier and a class-F-1 GaN transistor
   rectifier. The theory is based on a Fourier analysis of current and
   voltage waveforms, which arise across the rectifying element when
   different harmonic terminations are presented at its terminals. An
   analogy to harmonically terminated power amplifier (PA) theory is
   discussed. From the analysis, one can obtain an optimal value for the dc
   load given the RF circuit design. An upper limit on rectifier efficiency
   is derived for each case as a function of the device on-resistance.
   Measured results from fundamental frequency source-pull measurement of a
   Schottky diode rectifier with short-circuit terminations at the second
   and third harmonics are presented. A maximal device rectification
   efficiency of 72.8\% at 2.45 GHz matches the theoretical prediction. A
   2.14-GHz GaN HEMT rectifier is designed based on a class-F-1 PA. The
   gate of the transistor is terminated in an optimal impedance for
   self-synchronous rectification. Measurements of conversion efficiency
   and output dc voltage for varying gate RF impedance, dc load, and gate
   bias are shown with varying input RF power at the drain. The rectifier
   demonstrates an efficiency of 85\% for a 10-W input RF power at the
   transistor drain with a dc voltage of 30 V across a 98-Omega resistor.}},

   External injection at the output enables voltage and current
   wave-shaping to achieve high efficiency. Theoretical analysis of the
   waveforms shows that the maximal drain efficiency is 89.9\% with, at
   most, 0.13 dB of reduction in output power compared with the class-A
   case. The overall PA efficiency is derived in terms of the injector
   circuit efficiency. A harmonically injected prototype GaN HEMT 2.45-GHz
   PA demonstrates over 80\% efficiency with linearity improved over the
   class-AB PA without harmonic injection. Two-tone measurements show a
   reduction of the third-order intermodulation by -30 dBc in the linear

   (pHCNFs) are prepared by the coaxial electrospinning of a sacrificial
   core solution and an emulsified shell solution containing sacrificial
   islands for pore generation. After a thermal treatment, a systematic
   study is carried out to relate the resulting pore size in pHCNFs to the
   sacrificial islands in the emulsified shell. As the pores are introduced
   in pHCNFs, their initial capacity and reversible capacity rate are
   proved to increase significantly to 1003 mAhg(-1) and 61.8\%,
   respectively, compared to those (653 mAhg(-1) and 53.9\%) of nonporous
   HCNFs. The increased pore size and expanded graphene layers are believed
   to facilitate lithium insertion/extraction behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we explored the application of lipid-shelled, gas-filled
   microbubbles as a method for creating on-demand microporous hydrogels
   for cartilage tissue engineering. The technique allowed for homogenous
   distribution of cells and micropores within the scaffold, increasing the
   absorption coefficient of large solutes (70 kDa dextran) over controls
   in a concentration-dependent manner. The stability of the gas phase of
   the microbubbles depended on several factors, including the initial size
   distribution of the microbubble suspension, as well as the temperature
   and pressure during culture. Application of pressure cycles provided
   controlled release of the gas phase to generate fluid-filled micropores
   with remnant lipid. The resulting microporous agarose scaffolds were
   biocompatible, leading to a twofold increase in engineered cartilage
   properties (E-Y = 492 +/- 42 kPa for the bubble group vs. 249 +/- 49 kPa
   for the bubble-free control group) over a 42-day culture period. Our
   results suggest that microbubbles offer a simple and robust method of
   modulating mass transfer in cell-seeded hydrogels through mild
   pressurization, and the methodology may be expanded in the future to
   include focused ultrasound for improved spatio-temporal control. (C)

Abstract = {{The bone-cartilage, or osteochondral, interface resists remarkably high
   shear stresses and rarely fails, yet its mechanical characteristics are
   largely unknown. A complete understanding of this hierarchical system
   requires mechanical-property information at the length scales of both
   the interface and the connecting tissues. Here, we combined
   nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy (AFM) methods to investigate
   the multiscale mechanical properties across the osteochondral region.
   The nanoindentation modulus M ranged from that of the subchondral bone
   (M = 22.8 +/- 1.8 GPa) to that of hyaline articular cartilage embedded
   in PMMA (M = 5.7 +/- 1.0 GPa) across a narrow transition region <5 mu m
   wide. Contact resonance force microscopy (CR-FM), which measures the
   frequency and quality factor of the AFM cantilever's vibrational
   resonance in contact mode, was used to determine the relative storage
   modulus and loss tangent of the osteochondral interface. With better
   spatial resolution than nanoindentation, CR-FM measurements indicated an
   even narrower interface width of 2.3 +/- 1.2 mu m. Furthermore, CR-FM
   revealed a 24\% increase in the viscoelastic loss tangent from the
   articular calcified cartilage into the PMMA-embedded hyaline articular
   cartilage. Quantitative backscattered electron imaging provided
   complementary measurement of mineral content. Our results provide
   insight into the multiscale functionality of the osteochondral interface
   that will advance understanding of disease states such as osteoarthritis
   and aid in the development of biomimetic interfaces. Published by

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{213}},
Pages = {{272-285}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Solar-thermal reactors make use of concentrated solar irradiation to
   drive endothermic reactions. One example of processes that can be
   carried out in solar-thermal reactors is the solar-thermal conversion of
   biomass into synthesis gas (H-2, CO and CO2). The operation of these
   reactors is dependent on available sunlight and is affected by the
   presence of clouds, which act as disturbances. During a partly cloudy
   day, operation of solar-thermal reactors is still possible but flow rate
   adjustment is required in order to maintain consistent operation. Thus,
   a robust control system that will allow continuous high performance
   operation of the reactor is required in order to make the process
   financially viable. A model predictive control system (MPC) is proposed,
   which uses a model of the process to determine the required control
   signal. The first step in the development of the control system is the
   formulation of a dynamic mathematical model that describes process
   behavior adequately yet can be solved in real time. A simplified dynamic
   model for a solar-thermal transport-tube reactor has been developed
   based on unsteady mass and energy balances. The model was solved using
   MATLAB (TM) and validated with experimental data. Model validation was
   carried out at the High Flux Solar Furnace (HFSF) at the National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, CO, using different solar
   power level inputs. In this work, a description of the model and a
   comparison with the experimental results are presented. Simulations of
   the model were performed for a reflective and an absorbing cavity. The
   former allows for faster heating during experimental runs, while the
   latter is more representative of an industrial setting. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Considerations of efficiency often play an important role in debates on
   how to allocate new spectrum. Regulators want to maximize the common
   good, and try to use efficiency as a tool to do so; consequently, all
   the stakeholders strive to show that their proposal leads to efficient
   use of resources. However, often the discussion on particular methods or
   allocations becomes deadlocked. In this article we explore what is meant
   by efficiency metrics in wireless networks and what underlies the widely
   divergent claims for the relative efficiency of competing solutions. Our
   treatment attempts to take into account the regulatory and policy
   viewpoints on the development of system efficiency metrics. We will
   argue that it is important to define system optimization considerations
   and design goals for future wireless systems more clearly than has been
   done to date. We will show that although this may sound simple, it is
   far from it. We argue that efficiency needs to be analyzed within a full
   N-dimensional design space, and that connections between technology and
   policy need to be stated explicitly.}},

Abstract = {{Although change orders occur on many construction projects, data
   examined in this paper suggest that many change orders can be avoided on
   roadway construction projects through improved project planning and
   scoping. Statistical analyses of change orders on 610 Kentucky roadway
   construction projects from 2005-2008 examined how the causes of change
   orders varied between construction versus maintenance projects,
   different road types (e. g., state highways, interstate, and county
   roads), and construction type (e. g., earth work, structures, and road
   surfacing). The research examined the risk posed by engineering change
   orders by measuring the frequency and average percentage change in
   project costs for different types of change orders. Although the
   relative impacts did vary by analyses, the leading causes of change
   orders within the state consistently included contract omissions,
   owner-induced enhancements, and contract item overrun. The paper's
   primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is the
   establishment of evidence that many high risk change orders on roadway
   construction projects can be avoided through improved front end
   planning, whereas avoidance of other change orders, such as fuel and
   asphalt price adjustments, are more challenging because they can be
   caused by rapidly changing market conditions. The results show not only
   distinctive trends that are useful for constructability reviews on
   future projects, but also identify the need for new directions in front
   end planning and project scoping to minimize change orders on highway
   projects. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CO.1943-7862.0000550. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{Shape-memory polymers (SMPs) have emerged as a multi-functional
   materials platform and have been proposed for a variety of applications
   ranging from simple actuators to biomedical devices. The shape-memory
   cycle is demonstrated through a three-step process of programming,
   storage, and recovery. In this paper, recent findings that associate
   each step of the shape-memory cycle to unique recovery behavior are
   highlighted. The article focuses on the influence of deformation
   temperature, long-term storage (physical aging), partially constrained
   recovery, and mechanically driven recovery with respect to shape-memory

Abstract = {{Exposure to traumatic stressors typically causes lasting changes in
   emotionality and behavior. However, coping strategies have been shown to
   prevent and alleviate many stress consequences and the biological
   mechanisms that underlie coping are of great interest. Whereas the
   laboratory stressor inescapable tail-shock induces anxiety-like
   behaviors, here we demonstrate that permitting a rat to chew on a wooden
   dowel during administration of tail-shock prevented the development of
   anxiety like behaviors in the open field and juvenile social exploration
   tests. Uncontrollable stressors increase corticosterone and decrease
   thyroid hormone, and we hypothesized that coping would blunt these
   changes. While tail-shock did produce these effects, active coping did
   not alter hormone levels. The dissociation between behavioral resilience
   and circulating hormones is discussed with regard to the utility of
   these molecules as biomarkers for psychiatric disease. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Adenovirus has consistently been observed to be the most resistant known
   pathogen to disinfection by ultraviolet light. This has had an impact on
   regulations set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency
   regarding the use of UV disinfection for virus inactivation in
   groundwater and surface water. In this study, enhancement of UV
   inactivation of adenovirus was evaluated when hydrogen peroxide was
   added to create an advanced oxidation process (AOP). While 4 log
   reduction of adenovirus was determined to require a UV dose (UV fluence)
   of about 200 mJ/cm(2) from a low pressure (LP) UV source (emitting at
   253.7 nm), addition of 10 mg/L H2O2 achieved 4 log inactivation at a
   dose of 120 mJ/cm(2). DNA damage was assessed using a novel nested PCR
   approach, and similar levels of DNA damage between the two different
   treatments were noted, suggesting the AOP enhancement in inactivation
   was not due to additional DNA damage. Hydroxyl radicals produced in the
   advanced oxidation process are likely able to damage parts of the virus
   not targeted by LPUV, such as attachment proteins, enhancing the
   UV-induced inactivation. The AOP-enhanced inactivation potential was
   modeled in three natural waters. This research sheds light on the
   inactivation mechanisms of viruses with ultraviolet light and in the
   presence of hydroxyl radicals and provides a practical means to enhance
   inactivation of this UV-resistant virus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in the application of game theoretic methods
   to the design and control of multiagent systems. However, the existing
   game theoretic framework possesses inherent limitations with regards to
   these new prescriptive challenges. In this paper we propose a new
   framework, termed state based potential games, which introduces an
   underlying state space into the framework of potential games. This state
   space provides a system designer with an additional degree of freedom to
   help coordinate group behavior and overcome these limitations. Within
   the context of state based potential games, we characterize the limiting
   behavior of two learning algorithms termed finite memory better reply
   processes and log-linear learning. Lastly, we demonstrate the
   applicability of state based potential games on two cooperative control
   problems pertaining to distributed resource allocation and the design of
   local and distributed control laws. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was
   used to observe the dynamic behavior of polycytosine single-stranded DNA
   (ssDNA) (1-50 nucleotides long) at the interface between aqueous
   solution and hydrophilic (oligoethylene glycol-modified fused silica,
   OEG) and hydrophobic (octadecyltriethoxysilane-modified fused silica,
   OTES) solid surfaces. High throughput molecular tracking was used to
   determine >75 000 molecular trajectories for each molecular length,
   which were then used to calculate surface residence time and squared
   displacement (i.e., ``step-size{''}) distributions. On hydrophilic OEG
   surfaces, the surface residence time increased systematically with ssDNA
   chain length, as expected due to increasing molecule surface
   interactions. Interestingly, the residence time decreased with
   increasing ssDNA length on the hydrophobic OTES surface, particularly
   for longer chains. Similarly, the interfacial mobility of
   polynucleotides slowed with increasing chain length on OEG, but became
   faster on OTES. On OTES surfaces, the rates associated with desorption
   and surface diffusion exhibited the distinctive anomalous temperature
   dependence that is characteristic of hydrophobic interactions for
   short-chain species but not for longer chains. These combined
   observations suggest that long oligonucleotides adopt conformations
   minimizing hydrophobic interactions, e.g., by internal sequestration of
   hydrophobic nucleobases.}},

Abstract = {{A two-arm power spiral antenna with inherently low dispersion is

   shown that the power spiral's mid and high band axial ratio is

   characteristics, a combined Archimedean/power spiral is developed. VSWR
   below 2:1, clean patterns with wobble on the wave (WoW) and axial ratio
   < 3 dB over multi-octave wide bandwidth, all similar to those of
   well-performed frequency domain spirals, and more than 34\% fidelity
   factor improvement over the wide-field of view are achieved. Herein

Abstract = {{Naturally ventilated dairy cattle buildings are a major source of
   ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions. Accurate estimation in gas
   emissions constitutes the first step towards reducing the negative
   impact of emissions on the local environment. The greatest uncertainty
   in the emission estimation from a naturally ventilated livestock
   building with large openings is the determination of the air exchange
   rate (AER) and the choice of the gas sampling positions for
   representative outlet gas concentration. To reduce the uncertainties in
   the emission estimation, the performances of three techniques -
   integrating volume flow rates (VFR), tracer gas decay (TGD) and constant
   tracer gas (CG) for determination of ventilation rates were assessed in
   this paper by Computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In the developed CFD
   model, the animal occupied zone (AOZ) was treated as porous media and
   the resistance coefficient of porous zone was derived by pressure drops
   across AOZ using a sub-CFD model. The results showed that AERs predicted
   by VFR and TGD were in good agreement with each other within a large
   range of wind speeds. The large difference in AER estimation using CTG
   and VFR indicates that the mean CO2 concentration of the entire room may
   not represent the concentration at the air exit. It may be not suitable
   to calculate AER using mean concentration of internal sampling
   positions. When wind became stronger, the accuracy of CTG decreased. The
   gas sampling positions should be close to the openings or even in the
   openings; the gas sampling positions should be located adjacent to the
   openings or even in the openings. To reduce the uncertain introduced by
   wind direction, all the openings especially of different azimuths should
   possess sampling tubes. The maximum gas concentrations in the different
   openings could be the optimum value to represent the concentration in
   the exit air. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental diversity-multiplexing tradeoff of the three-node,
   multi-input, multi-output (MIMO), quasi-static, Rayleigh faded,
   half-duplex relay channel is characterized for an arbitrary number of
   antennas at each node and in which opportunistic scheduling (or dynamic
   operation) of the relay is allowed, i.e., the relay can switch between
   receive and transmit modes at a channel dependent time. In this most
   general case, the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is characterized as a
   solution to a simple, two-variable optimization problem. This problem is
   then solved in closed form for special classes of channels defined by
   certain restrictions on the numbers of antennas at the three nodes. The
   key mathematical tool developed here that enables the explicit
   characterization of the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff is the joint
   eigenvalue distribution of three mutually correlated random Wishart
   matrices. Besides being relevant here, this distribution result is
   interesting in its own right. Previously, without actually
   characterizing the diversity-multiplexing tradeoff, the optimality in
   this tradeoff metric of the dynamic compress-and-forward protocol based
   on the classical compress-and-forward scheme of Cover and El Gamal was
   shown by Yuksel and Erkip. However, this scheme requires global channel
   state information at the relay. In this paper, the so-called
   quantize-map and forward (QMF) coding scheme is adopted as the
   achievability scheme with the added benefit that it achieves optimal
   tradeoff with only the knowledge of the (channel dependent) switching
   time at the relay node. Moreover, in special classes of the MIMO
   half-duplex relay channel, the optimal tradeoff is shown to be
   attainable even without this knowledge. Such a result was previously
   known only for the half-duplex relay channel with a single antenna at
   each node, also via the QMF scheme. More generally, the explicit
   characterization of the tradeoff curve in this study enables the
   in-depth comparisons herein of full-duplex versus half-duplex relaying
   as well as static versus dynamic relaying, both as a function of the
   numbers of antennas at the three nodes.}},

Title = {{The Generalized Degrees of Freedom Region of the MIMO Interference
   Channel and Its Achievability}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{12}},
Pages = {{7188-7203}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) region of the MIMO Gaussian
   interference channel (IC) is obtained for the general case of an
   arbitrary number of antennas at each node and where the signal-to-noise
   ratios (SNRs) and interference-to-noise ratios vary with arbitrary
   exponents to a nominal SNR. The GDoF-optimal coding scheme involves
   message splitting and partial interference decoding and consists of
   linear Gaussian superposition coding of the private and common
   submessages that can be seen as jointly performing signal-space and
   signal-level interference alignment. The admissible degree of freedom
   (DoF)-splits between the private and common messages are also specified.
   A study of the GDoF region reveals various insights through the joint
   dependence of optimal interference management techniques at high SNR on
   the SNR exponents and the numbers of antennas at the four terminals. For
   instance, it reveals that, unlike in the scalar IC, treating
   interference as noise is not always GDoF-optimal even in the very weak
   interference regime. Moreover, while the DoF-optimal strategy that
   relies just on transmit/receive zero-forcing beamforming and time
   sharing is not GDoF optimal (and thus has an unbounded gap to capacity),
   the precise characterization of the very strong interference
   regime-where single-user DoF performance can be achieved simultaneously
   for both users-depends on the relative numbers of antennas at the four
   terminals and thus deviates from what it is in the single-input
   single-output case. For asymmetric numbers of antennas at the four
   nodes, the shape of the symmetric GDoF curve can be a ``distorted W{''}
   curve to the extent that for certain multiple-input multiple-output ICs
   it is a ``V{''} curve.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances act as powerful structuring forces on ecosystems. To ask
   whether environmental microbial communities have capacity to recover
   after a large disturbance event, we conducted a whole-ecosystem
   manipulation, during which we imposed an intense disturbance on
   freshwater microbial communities by artificially mixing a temperate lake
   during peak summer thermal stratification. We employed environmental
   sensors and water chemistry analyses to evaluate the physical and
   chemical responses of the lake, and bar-coded 16S ribosomal RNA gene
   pyrosequencing and automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis
   (ARISA) to assess the bacterial community responses. The artificial
   mixing increased mean lake temperature from 14 to 20 degrees C for seven
   weeks after mixing ended, and exposed the microorganisms to very
   different environmental conditions, including increased hypolimnion
   oxygen and increased epilimnion carbon dioxide concentrations. Though
   overall ecosystem conditions remained altered (with hypolimnion
   temperatures elevated from 6 to 20 degrees C), bacterial communities
   returned to their pre-manipulation state as some environmental
   conditions, such as oxygen concentration, recovered. Recovery to
   pre-disturbance community composition and diversity was observed within
   7 (epilimnion) and 11 (hypolimnion) days after mixing. Our results
   suggest that some microbial communities have capacity to recover after a
   major disturbance. The ISME Journal (2012) 6, 2153-2167;

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is applying nonlinear methods to assess changes in
   brain dynamics in a placebo-controlled study of midazolam-induced
   amnesia. Subjects injected with saline and midazolam during study,
   performed old/new recognition memory tests with EEG recording. Based on
   previous studies, as midazolam causes anterograde amnesia, we expected
   that midazolam would affect the EEG's degree of complexity. Recurrence
   quantification analysis, and approximate entropy were used in this
   assessment. These methods compare with other nonlinear techniques such
   as computation of the correlation dimension, are suitable for
   non-stationary EEG signals. Our findings suggest that EEG's complexity
   decreases during memory retrieval. Although this trend is observed in
   nonlinear curves related to the midazolam condition, the overall
   complexity were greater than in the saline condition. This result
   implies that impaired memory function caused by midazolam is associated
   with greater EEG's complexity compared to normal memory retrieval in
   saline injection.}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of two obliquely-intersecting Hiemenz planar stagnation
   point flows normal to a flat plate is studied. One flow of strain rate a
   aligned along the x-axis intersects the other of strain rate b at angle
   phi from the x-axis. Transformed to principal axes, a similarity
   reduction of the Navier-Stokes equation yields two ordinary differential
   equations with coefficients depending on the strain rate ratio sigma =

   equations via a two-parameter mapping, thereby giving an alternative
   interpretation of Howarth's problem. The large-sigma asymptotic behavior
   of solutions for the limiting angles phi = 0 degrees and 90 degrees are

Abstract = {{We assessed the potential impacts of increased river flooding from
   climate change on bridges in the continental United States. Daily
   precipitation statistics from four climate models and three greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions scenarios (A2, A1B, and B1) were used to capture a
   range of potential changes in climate. Using changes in maximum daily
   precipitation, we estimated changes to the peak flow rates for the
   100-year return period for 2,097 watersheds. These estimates were then
   combined with information from the National Bridge Inventory database to
   estimate changes to bridge scour vulnerability. The results indicate
   that there may be significant potential risks to bridges in the United
   States from increased precipitation intensities. Approximately 129,000
   bridges were found to be currently deficient. Tens of thousands to more
   than 100,000 bridges could be vulnerable to increased river flows.
   Results by region vary considerably. In general, more bridges in eastern
   areas are vulnerable than those in western areas. The highest GHG
   emissions scenarios result in the largest number of bridges being at
   risk. The costs of adapting vulnerable bridges to avoid increased damage
   associated with climate change vary from approximately \$140 to \$250
   billion through the 21st century. If these costs were spread out evenly
   over the century, the annual costs would be several billion dollars. The
   costs of protecting the bridges against climate change risks could be
   reduced by approximately 30\% if existing deficient bridges are improved
   with riprap.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial adsorption of three humanized monoclonal antibodies to
   emulsions of microdroplets of silicone oil was examined using indirect
   measurement via integrated peak areas in size-exclusion high-performance
   liquid chromatograms. The level of silicone oil far exceeded the typical
   levels used in prefillable syringes. The three antibodies rapidly
   adsorbed to silicone oilwater interfaces in various buffer formulations.
   Addition of 140 mM NaCl to solutions buffered with 10 mM l-histidine, pH
   6.0, increased the amount of protein adsorbed. Conversely, the extent of
   adsorption was significantly decreased by the addition of 0.03\% (w/v)
   Tween (R) 20. SternVolmer constants determined from intrinsic tryptophan
   fluorescence quenching by acrylamide suggested that the tertiary
   structure of the adsorbed antibodies was significantly perturbed.
   However, no aggregation or precipitation of the antibodies was detected.
   Flow cytometric analysis of emulsions of fluorescently stained silicone
   oil in solutions containing fluorescently labeled antibodies and light
   microscopy experiments suggested that agglomeration of silicone oil
   droplets in the emulsions occurred. Zeta potentials measured for
   silicone oil microdroplets with adsorbed antibodies suggested that
   droplet agglomeration was probably the result of reduced electrostatic
   energy barriers to droplet collisions. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

   sources based on carbonaceous species}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{305-315}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To identify the sources of PM2.5 - bound carbonaceous species and
   examine the spatial variability of source contributions in the Denver
   metropolitan area, positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to
   one year of every sixth day ambient PM2.5 compositional data, including
   elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), and 32 organic molecular
   markers, from four sites (two residential and two near-traffic).
   Statistics (median, inner quantiles and 5th - 95th percentiles range) of
   factor contributions, expressed as reconstructed carbonaceous mass (EC +
   OC), were estimated from PMF solutions of replicate datasets generated
   by using a stationary block bootstrap technique. A seven-factor solution
   was resolved for a set of data pooled across the four sites, as it gave
   the most interpretable results and had the highest rate of neural
   network factor matching (76.9\%). Identified factors were primarily
   associated with high plant wax, summertime emission, diesel vehicle
   emission, fossil fuel combustion, motor vehicle emission, lubricating
   oil combustion and wood burning. Pearson correlation coefficients (r)
   and coefficients of divergence (COD) were used to assess spatial
   variability of factor contributions. The summertime emission factor
   exhibited the highest spatial correlation (r = 0.74 - 0.88) and lowest
   CODs (0.32 - 0.38) among all resolved factors; while the three traffic
   dominated factors (diesel vehicle emission, motor vehicle emission and
   lubricating oil combustion) showed lower correlations (r = 0.47 - 0.55)
   and higher CODs (0.41 - 0.53) on average. Average total EC and OC mass
   were apportioned to each factor and showed a similar distribution across
   the four sites. Modeling uncertainties were defined as the 5th - 95th
   percentile range of the factor contributions derived from valid
   bootstrap PMF solutions, and were highly correlated with the median
   factor contribution in each factor (r = 0.77 - 0.98). Source
   apportionment was also performed on site specific datasets; the results
   exhibited similar factor profiles and temporal variation in factor
   contribution as those obtained for the pooled dataset, indicating that
   the four sites are primarily influenced by similar types of sources. On
   the other hand, differences were observed in absolute factor
   contributions between PMF solutions for the pooled versus site-specific
   datasets, likely due to the large uncertainties in EC and OC factor
   profiles derived from the site specific datasets with limited numbers of
   observations. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Denver Aerosol Sources and Health (DASH) study was designed to
   evaluate associations between PM2.5 species and sources and adverse
   human health effects. The DASH study generated a five-year (2003-2007)
   time series of daily speciated PM2.5 concentration measurements from a
   single, special-purpose monitoring site in Denver, CO. To evaluate the
   ability of this site to adequately represent the short term temporal
   variability of PM2.5 concentrations in the five county Denver
   metropolitan area, a one year supplemental set of PM2.5 samples was
   collected every sixth day at the original DASH monitoring site and
   concurrently at three additional sites. Two of the four sites, including
   the original DASH site, were located in residential areas at least 1.9
   km from interstate highways. The other two sites were located within 0.3
   km of interstate highways. Concentrations of elemental carbon (EC),
   organic carbon (OC), and 58 organic molecular markers were measured at
   each site. To assess spatial variability, site pairs were compared using
   the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and coefficient of divergence
   (COD), a statistic that provides information on the degree of uniformity
   between monitoring sites. Bi-weekly co-located samples collected from
   July 2004 to September 2005 were also analyzed and used to estimate the
   uncertainty associated with sampling and analytical measurement for each
   species. In general, the two near-highway sites exhibited higher
   concentrations of EC, OC, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and
   steranes than did the more residential sites. Lower spatial
   heterogeneity based on r and COD was inferred for all carbonaceous
   species after considering their divergence and lack of perfect
   correlations in co-located samples. Ratio ratio plots combined with
   available gasoline- and diesel-powered motor vehicle emissions profiles
   for the region suggested a greater impact to high molecular weight (HMW)
   PAHs from diesel-powered vehicles at the near-highway sites and a more
   uniformly distributed impact to ambient hopanes from gasoline-powered
   motor vehicles at all four sites. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Artery stiffening is known as an important pathological change that
   precedes small vessel dysfunction, but underlying cellular mechanisms
   are still elusive. This paper reports the development of a flow
   co-culture system that imposes a range of arterial-like pulse flow
   waves, with similar mean flow rate but varied pulsatility controlled by
   upstream stiffness, onto a 3-D endothelial-smooth muscle cell
   co-culture. Computational fluid dynamics results identified a uniform
   flow area critical for cell mechanobiology studies. For validation,
   experimentally measured flow profiles were compared to computationally
   simulated flow profiles, which revealed percentage difference in the
   maximum flow to be < 10, < 5, or < 1\% for a high, medium, or low pulse
   flow wave, respectively. This comparison indicated that the
   computational model accurately demonstrated experimental conditions. The
   results from endothelial expression of proinflammatory genes and from
   determination of proliferating smooth muscle cell percentage both showed
   that cell activities did not vary within the identified uniform flow
   region, but were upregulated by high pulse flow compared to steady flow.
   The flow system developed and characterized here provides an important
   tool to enhance the understanding of vascular cell remodeling under flow
   environments regulated by stiffening.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{421}},

Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Gas-liquid porometry is a common method for characterizing
   microfiltration (MF) membranes. This paper provides a modified approach
   to analyze data from it. Herein, we combine porometry results with
   porosity measurements to improve prediction of the gas and liquid
   permeances through the membranes. Pore size distribution (PSD) and
   porosity measurements were performed for a range of membranes including
   symmetric and asymmetrically-stacked symmetric membranes, and an
   intrinsically asymmetric membrane. Our modified approach determines the
   tortuosity for each pore size bin (range) during the estimation of the
   PSD. For the symmetric MF membranes, there was high discrepancy between
   the measured mean pore size and the manufacturer's data, thus,
   reinforcing the importance of knowing the basis for membrane ratings.
   Our study also examined the effect of asymmetry on the measured PSD. The
   asymmetric membranes were found to give a smaller mean pore size
   compared to their symmetric component membranes. Additionally, the
   orientation of asymmetric membranes provided different results for both
   the mean pore size and tortuosity. A comparison between the common and
   modified approaches to analyze the data was made through the estimation
   of liquid permeances. Better correlation (at least a 7\% improvement) of
   measured and estimated permeances for several fluids was found for our
   modified approach as compared to the classical methods because of the
   inclusion of a specific tortuosity for each pore size bin. The average
   tortuosity of the membranes under study varied from 0.936 to 5.020 with
   the larger nominal pore membranes having higher values compared to the
   smaller ones. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We combined an ensemble of satellite altimetry, interferometry, and
   gravimetry data sets using common geographical regions, time intervals,
   and models of surface mass balance and glacial isostatic adjustment to
   estimate the mass balance of Earth's polar ice sheets. We find that
   there is good agreement between different satellite methods-especially
   in Greenland and West Antarctica-and that combining satellite data sets
   leads to greater certainty. Between 1992 and 2011, the ice sheets of
   Greenland, East Antarctica, West Antarctica, and the Antarctic Peninsula
   changed in mass by -142 +/- 49, +14 +/- 43, -65 +/- 26, and -20 +/- 14
   gigatonnes year(-1), respectively. Since 1992, the polar ice sheets have
   contributed, on average, 0.59 +/- 0.20 millimeter year(-1) to the rate
   of global sea-level rise.}},

Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the dependence of ozone direct radiative forcing (DRF) on
   the mixture and spatial distribution of precursor emissions is a key
   step towards understanding the impact of air quality standards on
   climate. We use here a combination of satellite observations of ozone
   and its radiative effect in conjunction with an adjoint chemical
   transport model to determine the ozone DRF due to global, anthropogenic
   NOx, CO, and non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHC) emissions regionally at 2
   degrees x 2.5 degrees regions resolution. We show that 8\% of the ozone
   DRF from the sum of all these emissions can be attributed to 15 regions,
   which are predominantly located in China and the United States (US). To
   achieve an equivalent reduction in ozone DRF, necessary emission
   reductions for each precursor vary intra-continentally by a factor of
   3-10 and globally by over an order of magnitude. The contribution of NOx
   emissions to ozone DRF relative to CO and NMHC emissions within
   individual regions varies globally by nearly a factor of two. Citation:

Title = {{Seasonal and diurnal variation of geomagnetic activity:
   Russell-McPherron effect during different IMF polarity and/or extreme
   solar wind conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{The Russell-McPherron (R-M) effect is one of the most prevailing
   hypotheses accounting for semiannual variation of geomagnetic activity.
   To validate the R-M effect and investigate the difference of geomagnetic
   activity variation under different interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)
   polarity and during extreme solar wind conditions (interplanetary
   shock), we have analyzed 42 years interplanetary magnetic field and
   geomagnetic indices data and 1270 SSC (storm sudden commencement) events
   from the year 1968 to 2010 by defining the R-M effect with
   positive/negative IMF polarity (IMF away/toward the Sun). The results
   obtained in this study have shown that the response of geomagnetic
   activity to the R-M effect with positive/negative IMF polarity are
   rather profound: the geomagnetic activity is much more intense around
   fall equinox when the direction of IMF is away the Sun, while much more
   intense around spring equinox when the direction of IMF is toward the
   Sun. The seasonal and diurnal variation of geomagnetic activity after
   SSCs can be attributed to both R-M effect and the equinoctial
   hypothesis; the R-M effect explains most part of variance of southward
   IMF, while the equinoctial hypothesis explains similar variance of ring
   current injection and geomagnetic indices as the R-M effect. However,
   the R-M effect with positive/negative IMF polarity explains the
   difference between SSCs with positive/negative IMF B-y accurately, while
   the equinoctial hypothesis cannot explain such difference at the spring
   and fall equinoxes. Thus, the R-M effect with positive/negative IMF
   polarity is more reasonable to explain seasonal and diurnal variation of
   geomagnetic activity under extreme solar wind conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have recently been shown to
   be effective catalyst modifiers for increasing the selectivity of the
   hydrogenation of 1-epoxy-3-butene (EpB) to 1-epoxybutane in the gas
   phase. In the results reported here, we demonstrate that SAM coatings
   can similarly be applied to other supported metals (Pt) and in
   liquid-phase reaction environments. Coating a Pt/Al2O3 catalyst with
   n-octadecanethiol resulted in a large improvement in selectivity during
   vapor-phase EpB hydrogenation, similar to that observed for supported
   Pd. The liquid phase hydrogenation of EpB using SAM-coated catalysts
   showed similar selectivity trends in some cases, but interactions of the
   solvent with the SAM were also important in controlling selectivity. In
   particular, using a heptane solvent, epoxybutane selectivity increased
   from 36\% with an uncoated Pd/Al2O3 catalyst to 74\% with a thioglycerol
   SAM-coated catalyst. SAM quality was shown to have a strong impact on
   the rate of reaction but little effect on selectivity. The results
   generally indicated that selectivity modification with thiol SAMs is
   extendable to other supported metals and a variety of reaction
   environments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Custom-designed surfactants, known as ``linactants{''}, have the ability
   to reduce the line tension between coexisting phases within mixed
   monolayers of chemically dissimilar compounds at the air water
   interface. Thus far, linactants have been successfully identified for
   only one type of chemical dissimilarity, involving mixed monolayers of
   hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon surfactants. In the present work, we have
   pursued a more general interpretation of linactant compounds by
   extending the concept to a new system that is comprised of a mixture of
   aliphatic (pentadecanoic acid) and aromatic (p-terphenyl carboxylic
   acid) compounds. We found that the ``bare{''} line tension between
   phases of this mixed monolayer was similar to 4 pN, and within the same
   order of magnitude as our previous measurement in mixed monolayers
   containing hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons. Furthermore, we examined a
   homologous series of potential linactant compounds possessing an
   aliphatic tail of variable length and a p-terphenyl block. We determined
   that linactants with longer tails were able to reduce the line tension
   more efficiently and effectively. In particular, the addition of only
   0.1496 of a linactant with an 11-carbon chain reduced the line tension
   by more than a factor of 2. We hypothesize that the efficiency of this
   particular linactant is associated with its long tail; this creates
   strong van der Waals interactions with the aliphatic chains and enables
   the tail to adopt conformations that facilitate pi-stacking interactions
   with the aromatic compounds within the monolayer.}},

Abstract = {{Strain engineered graphene has been predicted to show many interesting
   physics and device applications. Here we study biaxial compressive
   strain in graphene/hexagonal boron nitride heterostructures after
   thermal cycling to high temperatures likely due to their thermal
   expansion coefficient mismatch. The appearance of sub-micron
   self-supporting bubbles indicates that the strain is spatially
   inhomogeneous. Finite element modeling suggests that the strain is
   concentrated on the edges with regular nano-scale wrinkles, which could
   be a playground for strain engineering in graphene. Raman spectroscopy
   and mapping is employed to quantitatively probe the magnitude and
   distribution of strain. From the temperature-dependent shifts of Raman G
   and 2D peaks, we estimate the TEC of graphene from room temperature to
   above 1000K for the first time.}},

Abstract = {{Highly conducting and transparent hybrid organic-inorganic thin films
   were grown using atomic layer deposition (ALD) and molecular layer
   deposition (MLD) techniques The conducting films were grown at 150
   degrees C by combining ZnO ALD and zincone MLD processes. ZnO ALD was
   performed using diethylzinc (DEZ) and water (H2O). Zincone MLD was
   performed using DEZ and hydroquinone (HQ). The ALD:MLD alloys were
   deposited by controlling the relative number of ALD and MLD cycles in
   the reaction sequence. The growth of the ALD:MLD alloys was examined
   using in situ quartz crystal microbalance and Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy studies. The surface reactions during alloy growth were
   self-limiting, and the ALD and. MLD reaction sequences produced linear
   growth rates. The alloys exhibited exceptional conductivity relative to
   ZnO ALD films grown at 150 degrees C. The highest conductivities were
   obtained from alloys with ALD:MLD cycle ratios of 1:1 and 2:2. The 1:1
   and 2:2 alloy films yielded conductivities of 116 and 170 S/cm,
   respectively. In comparison, ZnO ALD films displayed a conductivity of
   14 S/cm The high conductivities for the zincone alloys may result from
   the modulated structure in the alloy that provides high charge carrier
   densities and high mobilities. The alloy films were also transparent and
   displayed high transmission until their band gap absorption at <400 inn.
   In addition, nanoindentation studies revealed that the elastic modulus
   and hardness of the alloys both increased with the fraction of ZnO ALD
   in the alloy. These hybrid organic-inorganic alloys may have the
   potential to replace. indium tin oxide (ITO) as a conducting transparent
   film.}},

Title = {{Diurnal variations of the Fe layer in the mesosphere and lower
   thermosphere: Four season variability and solar effects on the layer
   bottomside at McMurdo (77.8 degrees S, 166.7 degrees E), Antarctica}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{We provide one of the first reports on diurnal variations of the Fe
   layer in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) using nearly 1000 h
   of data collected with an Fe Boltzmann lidar at McMurdo, Antarctica from
   December 2010 through 2011. The Fe layer undergoes significant diurnal
   variations on the bottomside in autumn and spring with daytime downward
   extension and nighttime upward contraction. Such variations are absent
   in winter under 24-h darkness. Summertime Fe density perturbations
   exhibit downward tidal phase progression. The bottom growth/contraction
   of Fe layer is shown to be a solar effect that is closely correlated
   with the solar elevation angle. The bottom transition corresponds to the
   solar elevation between -9 degrees and -1 degrees when sunlight passes
   through the lower atmosphere before reaching the MLT. Once the solar
   elevation is above -1 degrees, the layer bottom remains nearly flat at
   its daytime altitude (similar to 70-73 km). When the solar elevation is
   below -9 degrees, the layer bottom stays at its nighttime altitude
   (similar to 78-80 km). The descending transition rate at dawn is faster
   than the ascending rate at dusk. The time delay between appreciable Fe
   density and sunrise/sunset at the MLT increases with decreasing altitude
   and varies with season. We describe qualitatively how both neutral Fe
   chemistry with H, O and O-3 and photolysis of Fe-containing molecular
   species may play important roles in Fe diurnal variations. Accurate rate
   coefficients for Fe neutral and photochemical reactions are essential to
   quantitatively explain the solar effects in diurnal variations of the Fe
   layer.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, single molecule-based superresolution fluorescence microscopy
   has surpassed the diffraction limit to improve resolution to the order
   of 20 nm or better. These methods typically use image fitting that
   assumes an isotropic emission pattern from the single emitters as well
   as control of the emitter concentration. However, anisotropic
   single-molecule emission patterns arise from the transition dipole when
   it is rotationally immobile, depending highly on the molecule's 3D
   orientation and z position. Failure to account for this fact can lead to
   significant lateral (x, y) mislocalizations (up to similar to 50-200
   nm). This systematic error can cause distortions in the reconstructed
   images, which can translate into degraded resolution. Using parameters
   uniquely inherent in the double-lobed nature of the Double-Helix Point
   Spread Function, we account for such mislocalizations and simultaneously
   measure 3D molecular orientation and 3D position. Mislocalizations
   during an axial scan of a single molecule manifest themselves as an
   apparent lateral shift in its position, which causes the standard
   deviation (SD) of its lateral position to appear larger than the SD
   expected from photon shot noise. By correcting each localization based
   on an estimated orientation, we are able to improve SDs in lateral
   localization from similar to 2x worse than photon-limited precision (48
   vs. 25 nm) to within 5 nm of photon-limited precision. Furthermore, by
   averaging many estimations of orientation over different depths, we are
   able to improve from a lateral SD of 116 (similar to 4x worse than the
   photon-limited precision; 28 nm) to 34 nm (within 6 nm of the photon
   limit).}},

Abstract = {{The 3D orientation and location of individual molecules is an important
   marker for the local environment and the state of a molecule. Therefore
   dipole localization and orientation estimation is important for
   biological sensing and imaging. Precise dipole localization is also
   critical for superresolution imaging. We propose and analyze wide field
   microscope configurations to simultaneously measure these parameters for
   multiple fixed dipole emitters. Examination of the images of radiating
   dipoles reveals how information transfer and precise detection can be
   improved. We use an information theoretic analysis to quantify the
   performance limits of position and orientation estimation through
   comparison of the Cramer-Rao lower bounds in a photon limited
   environment. We show that bi-focal and double-helix
   polarization-sensitive systems are attractive candidates for
   simultaneously estimating the 3D dipole location and orientation. (C)

Title = {{New Alternately Colored FRET Sensors for Simultaneous Monitoring of Zn2+
   in Multiple Cellular Locations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Genetically encoded sensors based on fluorescence resonance energy
   transfer (FRET) are powerful tools for reporting on ions, molecules and
   biochemical reactions in living cells. Here we describe the development
   of new sensors for Zn2+ based on alternate FRET-pairs that do not
   involve the traditional CFP and YFP. Zn2+ is an essential micronutrient
   and plays fundamental roles in cell biology. Consequently there is a
   pressing need for robust sensors to monitor Zn2+ levels and dynamics in
   cells with high spatial and temporal resolution. Here we develop a suite
   of sensors using alternate FRET pairs, including tSapphire/TagRFP,
   tSapphire/mKO, Clover/mRuby2, mOrange2/mCherry, and mOrange2/mKATE.
   These sensors were targeted to both the nucleus and cytosol and
   characterized and validated in living cells. Sensors based on the new
   FRET pair Clover/mRuby2 displayed a higher dynamic range and better
   signal-to-noise ratio than the remaining sensors tested and were optimal
   for monitoring changes in cytosolic and nuclear Zn2+. Using a green-red
   sensor targeted to the nucleus and cyan-yellow sensor targeted to either
   the ER, Golgi, or mitochondria, we were able to monitor Zn2+ uptake
   simultaneously in two compartments, revealing that nuclear Zn2+ rises
   quickly, whereas the ER, Golgi, and mitochondria all sequester Zn2+ more
   slowly and with a delay of 600-700 sec. Lastly, these studies provide
   the first glimpse of nuclear Zn2+ and reveal that nuclear Zn2+ is
   buffered at a higher level than cytosolic Zn2+.}},

Abstract = {{We describe, both numerically and experimentally, a rectangular S-band
   waveguide having electromagnetic bandgap properties (stopbands)
   controlled with sheets of metafilms composed of ceramic particles.
   Metafilms composed of TiO2 ceramic cubes are fabricated for the
   waveguide loading, and 2, 3, or 4 layers are inserted. The dispersion
   analysis estimates the frequency ranges of the stopbands to be 2.49-2.66
   GHz, 3.34-3.40 GHz, and 3.66-3.79 GHz. The field patterns at a resonance
   around the stopband are presented and discussed. We find that more
   metafilm layers provide stronger attenuation, broader stopbands, and
   steeper roll-offs and that the effective refractive index extracted from
   the reflection and transmission coefficients explains those
   characteristics adequately. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In-situ measurements, the direct interception and analysis of dust
   particles by spacecraft-based instrumentation, provide insights into the
   dynamical, physical and chemical properties of cosmic dust. The most
   sensitive detection methods for dust particles in space are based on
   impact ionization. Laser ionization is used for the test, development,
   and calibration of impact ionization instruments and to complement
   laboratory based particle impact experiments. A typical setup uses a 355
   nm Nd-YAG laser with a pulse length of about 5 ns. It is necessary to
   investigate the properties of both processes with respect to their
   comparability. A study was performed to find out to what extent laser
   ionization can be used to simulate impact ionization. The findings show
   that laser ionization and impact ionization show similarities, which can
   be used to test the functionality of dust impact detectors, especially
   time-of-flight instruments. Our paper provides information on what
   extent these similarities hold and where their limits are. (C) 2012

Title = {{Lipid monolayer collapse and microbubble stability}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{183}},
Pages = {{82-99}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Microbubbles are micrometer-size gaseous particles suspended in water,
   and they are often stabilized by a lipid monolayer shell. Natural
   microbubbles are found in freshwater and saltwater systems, and
   engineered microbubbles have a variety of applications in food sciences,
   biotechnology and medicine. Lipid-coated microbubbles are found to have
   remarkable stability and mechanical behavior owing to the resistance of
   the lipid monolayer encapsulation to collapse. The purpose of this
   review is to tie in recent observations of lipid-coated microbubble
   dissolution and gas exchange with current literature on the physics of
   lipid monolayer collapse in the context of lung surfactant. Based on
   this analysis, we conclude that microbubble shells collapse through the
   nucleation of microscopic folds, which then catalyze the formation and
   aggregation of new folds, leading to macroscopic folding events. This
   process results in a cyclic behavior of crumple-to-smooth transitions,
   which can be modulated through lipid composition. Eventually, the
   microbubbles stabilize at 1-2 mu m diameter, regardless of initial size
   or lipid composition, and various mechanisms for this stabilization are
   postulated. Our ultimate goal is to inspire the reader to consider lipid
   monolayer collapse as the main long-term stabilizing mechanism for
   lipid-coated microbubbles, and to stimulate the use of microbubbles as a
   platform for studying monolayer collapse phenomena. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   Mitigation of calcium carbonate scaling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},

Volume = {{419}},

Abstract = {{The use of ultrasonic time-domain reflectometry (UTDR) in combination
   with statistically based analysis has been utilized to provide timely
   warning of the initial onset of local calcium carbonate scaling. The
   methodology was able to detect the onset of scaling in real time before
   any significant decrease in permeate flux was observed. Ultrasonic
   detection of scaling was confirmed via post-mortem examination of the
   membrane that showed the presence of aragonite crystals that were as
   small as 20 mu m and covered less than 10\% of the membrane surface. The
   ultrasonic methodology was then employed to trigger a change in flow
   direction (reversal of the concentrate and feed ends of the flow
   channel) when scaling was detected. When in forward flow, the upstream,
   midstream and downstream sections of the membranes had aragonite
   supersaturation values of SI similar to 2.0, similar to 5.3 and similar
   to 7.65, respectively; when the flow direction was changed, the SI
   values at the ends were switched but the SI at the midstream remained at
   SI similar to 5.3. Results indicated that flow reversal effectively
   mitigated scaling in downstream sections of the membrane even though
   they were periodically exposed to the highest supersaturation
   conditions. It was demonstrated that prompt intervention after an
   ultrasonic scaling signal improved the efficacy of flow reversal. The
   results reflect a significant advance in the use of UTDR in which the
   methodology is applied for active control of scaling miti ation rather
   than limited to passive detection of scale formation. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Reverse osmosis (RO) desalination is a well-established process that
   removes salt from sea water or brackish water sources. However, scaling
   by sparingly soluble salts on the membrane surface has been shown to
   significantly degrade membrane performance. We report the results from a
   comprehensive study evaluating the effectiveness of flow reversal (FR)
   controlled by ultrasonic sensors in mitigating scaling during RO
   desalination. The work utilized a sophisticated multi-port bench-scale
   flat-sheet cross-flow module with the ability to operate in FR mode with
   externally mounted ultrasonic sensors. A novel signal-analysis
   methodology was developed to utilize the ultrasonic waveforms to control
   a switch in flow direction at the onset of local scaling. Experiments
   were conducted under controlled conditions with repeated forward-flow
   (FF) and reverse-flow (RF) cycles. Data from the experiments confirmed
   that FR controlled by ultrasonic sensors can effectively mitigate
   scaling on the membrane surface and avoid the expected level of
   permeate-flow decrease. These results were validated by post-mortem
   membrane analysis including scalant gravimetric and membrane
   area-coverage measurements. Overall, the work demonstrates the
   successful adaptation of ultrasonic sensors for active process control
   in which the timing of the change in flow direction is critical. (c)

Title = {{Isolated Toll-like Receptor Transmembrane Domains Are Capable of
   Oligomerization}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Toll-like receptors (TLRs) act as the first line of defense against
   bacterial and viral pathogens by initiating critical defense signals
   upon dimer activation. The contribution of the transmembrane domain in
   the dimerization and signaling process has heretofore been overlooked in
   favor of the extracellular and intracellular domains. As mounting
   evidence suggests that the transmembrane domain is a critical region in
   several protein families, we hypothesized that this was also the case
   for Toll-like receptors. Using a combined biochemical and biophysical
   approach, we investigated the ability of isolated Toll-like receptor
   transmembrane domains to interact independently of extracellular domain
   dimerization. Our results showed that the transmembrane domains had a
   preference for the native dimer partners in bacterial membranes for the
   entire receptor family. All TLR transmembrane domains showed strong
   homotypic interaction potential. The TLR2 transmembrane domain
   demonstrated strong heterotypic interactions in bacterial membranes with
   its known interaction partners, TLR1 and TLR6, as well as with a
   proposed interaction partner, TLR10, but not with TLR4, TLR5, or
   unrelated transmembrane receptors providing evidence for the specificity
   of TLR2 transmembrane domain interactions. Peptides for the
   transmembrane domains of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR6 were synthesized to
   further study this subfamily of receptors. These peptides validated the
   heterotypic interactions seen in bacterial membranes and demonstrated
   that the TLR2 transmembrane domain had moderately strong interactions
   with both TLR1 and TLR6. Combined, these results suggest a role for the
   transmembrane domain in Toll-like receptor oligomerization and as such,
   may be a novel target for further investigation of new therapeutic
   treatments of Toll-like receptor mediated diseases.}},

   behavior through myriad controlled signals, and aberrant cues can result

Title = {{Middle and upper thermosphere density structures due to nonmigrating
   tides}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{NOV 9}},
Abstract = {{Density measurements from the SETA satellites near 200 km during
   1982-1984, and the CHAMP and GRACE satellites between 350 and 550 km
   during 2002-2009, are used to investigate longitudinal structures in
   density due to nonmigrating tides, and to evaluate performance of the
   recently-created Climatological Tidal Model of the Thermosphere (CTMT).
   Amplitudes for the diurnal and semidiurnal tidal components fall roughly
   in the range of 4-10\%. Diurnal tides at middle and low latitudes are
   often characterized by wave-3 and/or wave-4 structures, consistent with
   the presence of the eastward-propagating diurnal tides with zonal wave
   numbers s = 2 and s = 3 (DE2 and DE3, respectively) and with expected
   seasonal variability based on previous works. Semidiurnal structures
   often reflect the presence of the eastward-propagating tide with s = 2
   (SE2), which gives rise to wave-4 structures that have a more
   antisymmetric relationship between N. and S. hemispheres. Similarities
   in structures between different years underscore the fact that the
   thermosphere is subject to repeatable and reproducible forcing by
   upward-propagating tides, but there are also occasions where
   considerable departures from climatology occur. Wave-2 structures at
   high latitudes likely contain signatures of the eastward-propagating
   diurnal tide with s = 1 (DE1) and the zonally-symmetric (s = 0)
   semidiurnal oscillation (S0) propagating upwards from below, but these
   and other waves that produce wave-2 can also be forced in-situ by
   high-latitude processes. The CTMT captures the salient features of the
   observations at middle and low latitudes, although with lower amplitudes
   that are likely due to phase cancelation effects resulting from
   averaging over multiple years (2002-2006). We propose that some
   discrepancies between the CTMT and our observational results may be
   associated with wave components arising in-situ in the thermosphere as
   the result of nonlinear tide-tide interactions and plasma neutral
   interactions, the latter being especially prominent at high latitudes
   where the displaced geomagnetic frame is particularly influential.
   Modeling studies are required to validate these proposed mechanisms,
   however.}},

Abstract = {{Unpolarized cross sections and double-helicity asymmetries of

   from p + p collisions at root s = 62.4 GeV are presented. The PHENIX
   measurement of the cross sections for 1.0 < p(T) < 4.5 GeV/c are
   consistent with perturbative QCD calculations at next-to-leading order
   in the strong-coupling constant, alpha(s). Resummed pQCD calculations
   including terms with next-to-leading-log accuracy, yielding reduced
   theoretical uncertainties, also agree with the data. The double-helicity
   asymmetry, sensitive at leading order to the gluon polarization in a
   momentum-fraction range of 0.05 less than or similar to x(gluon) less
   than or similar to 0.2, is consistent with recent global
   parametrizations disfavoring large gluon polarization.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate the utility and consistency of different speciation data
   sets in source apportionment of PM2.5, positive matrix factorization
   (PMF) coupled with a bootstrap technique for uncertainty assessment was
   applied to four different 1-year data sets composed of bulk species,
   bulk species and water-soluble elements (WSE), bulk species and organic
   molecular markers (OMM), and all species. The five factors resolved by
   using only the bulk species best reproduced the observed concentrations
   of PM2.5 components. Combining WSE with bulk species as PMF inputs also
   produced five factors. Three of them were linked to soil, road dust, and
   processed dust, and together contributed 26.0\% of reconstructed PM2.5
   mass. A 7-factor PMF solution was identified using speciated OMM and
   bulk species. The EC/sterane and summertime/selective aliphatic factors
   had the highest contributions to EC (39.0\%) and OC (53.8\%),
   respectively. The nine factors resolved by including all species as
   input data are consistent with those from the previous two solutions
   (WSE and bulk species, OMM and bulk species) in both factor profiles and
   contributions (r = 0.88-1.00). The comparisons across different
   solutions indicate that the selection of input data set may depend on
   the PM components or sources of interest for specific source-oriented
   health study.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of lithium ion batteries can be improved through the use of
   functionally graded electrodes. Here, we present a computational
   framework for optimizing the layout of electrodes using a multiscale
   lithium ion battery cell model. The model accounts for nonlinear
   transient transport processes and mechanical deformations at multiple
   scales. A key component of the optimization methodology is the
   formulation of the adjoint sensitivity equations of the multiscale
   battery model. The efficient solution of the adjoint equations relies on
   the decomposition of the multiscale problem into multiple,
   computationally small problems associated with the individual
   realizations of the microscale model. This decomposition method is shown
   to significantly reduce the computational time needed for sensitivity
   analysis versus numerical finite differencing. The potential of the
   proposed optimization framework is illustrated with numerical problems
   involving both macroscale and microscale performance criteria and design
   variables. The usable capacity of a lithium ion battery cell is
   maximized while limiting the stress level in the electrode particles
   through manipulation of the local porosities and particle radii. The
   optimization results suggest that optimal functionally graded electrodes
   improve the performance of a battery cell over using uniform porosity
   and particle radius distributions. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Title = {{Small intestine mucosal adhesivity to in vivo capsule robot materials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{15}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multiple research groups are investigating the feasibility of miniature,
   swallowable, in vivo, untethered robots that are capable of traversing
   the small intestine for the purpose of acquiring biometrics and
   performing simple surgical procedures. A mathematical model of the
   intraluminal environment will speed the development of these so-called
   Robotic Capsule Endoscopes (RCEs), and to this end, the authors, in
   previous work, initiated a comprehensive program for characterizing both
   the active and passive forces exerted by the small intestine on an
   RCE-sized solid bolus. In this work, forces due to adhesivity between
   RCE materials and the mucosa are investigated. The experimental factors
   are adhesive modality (peel and tack), material (polycarbonate,
   micropatterned polydimethyl-siloxane, stainless steel, and mucosa), and
   bowel region (proximal, middle, and distal). The mucosa is excised from
   a fasting pig, stored in lactated ringer's solution at 3 degrees C, and
   then tested at room temperature within 43 h of excision. The results
   show the mean tack strength of the mucosa to engineering materials was
   0.198 +/- 0.070 mJ cm(-2). The mean peel strength was 0.055 +/- 0.016 mJ
   cm(-2). This study marks the first time, to the authors' knowledge, that
   adhesivity between small intestinal mucosa and RCE engineering materials
   has been measured. The adhesivity values acquired from this study will
   provide a valuable input into analytical and numerical models of the
   gastrointestinal tract, specifically models that account for the
   interfacial properties of the tissue. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Energy use attributed to residential buildings makes up nearly 16\% of
   the total energy consumption in Mexico, yet a larger portion of the
   Mexican Official Standards for Energy (NOM-ENER) are specific to the
   commercial building sector which only makes up 3\% of the total energy
   consumption in Mexico. Furthermore the NOM-ENER standards related to
   residential buildings are developed through a component based approach
   where energy efficiency guidelines are outlined for individual pieces of
   equipment with no interactions between these components taken into
   consideration. In this paper, a holistic and integrative energy analysis
   approach is considered to improve energy efficiency in residential
   buildings. Specifically, the study presented in this paper investigates
   the interactions between various energy efficiency measures and thermal
   comfort measures for residential buildings in Salamanca, Guanajuato
   using detailed simulation and optimization procedures. The results from
   the optimization analysis suggest a combination of improved appliance
   efficiencies, increased levels of roof and wall thermal insulation and
   improved water heating system efficiencies is required to achieve a
   minimum cost solution which results in nearly 52\% annual energy savings
   for new homes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Tempest unmanned aircraft system was developed to demonstrate the
   feasibility of sampling severe convective storms with small unmanned
   aircraft. The unmanned aircraft system, including its ground support
   vehicles, was deployed during the Spring 2010 VORTEX2 (second
   Verification of the Origins of Rotation in Tornadoes Experiment) field
   experiment. The purpose was validation and verification of the systems,
   capabilities, and effectiveness of a small unmanned aircraft system to
   operate in a supercell thunderstorm, within current airspace regulatory
   constraints. The mission concept of operations that determined the
   performance requirements for the airframe, and command, control, and
   communications systems, is presented. The airframe design process is
   described, with emphasis on design solutions unique to a low-cost,
   portable storm-penetrating unmanned aircraft system. Results from test
   flights and from the Spring 2010 VORTEX2 deployment are compared to
   evaluate the performance of the airframe subsystems, particularly the
   autopilot. A preliminary analysis of the local atmospheric turbulence
   spectrum is also presented. Finally, conclusions are presented with a
   discussion of the engineering and science needs for the next-generation
   storm-penetrating unmanned aircraft system.}},

Abstract = {{As a sonic boom pressure signal propagates through the atmosphere, the
   age variable that quantifies nonlinear distortions approaches an
   asymptotic limit. As this limit is approached, distortion of the
   pressure signal decreases until it is ``frozen.{''} For an aircraft at
   51,000 ft and Mach 1.7, the age variable is still 24\% away from this
   limit. Alternatively, a sonic boom may be frozen by balancing lobes in
   the F function. Software, based on modified linear theory, is used to
   design an supersonic business jet that uses lifting components to create
   a lobe-balanced sonic boom. Leading and trailing shock pressure rise,
   peak overpressure, and perceived level of loudness are evaluated for a
   several configurations. In one case, the leading shock is reduced from
   1.4 to 0.83 psf, and in another, the trailing shock is reduced from 1.2
   to 0.87 psf. The software also calculates performance metrics to ensure
   reasonable longitudinal stability and performance. Off-track signatures
   demonstrate multishock sonic booms to the sides. Sonic booms are
   compared with computational fluid dynamics to demonstrate the accuracy
   of the method.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental studies have observed that the small-strain shear modulus
   (G(max)) of unsaturated soils measured during hydraulic hysteresis has a
   greater magnitude during imbibition than during drainage when plotted as
   a function of matric suction. To capture this behavior, a semiempirical
   model was developed to interpret the impacts of the stress state and
   hydraulic hysteresis on G(max) of low plasticity soils. Different from
   previous empirical relationships for G(max), this model incorporates
   elastoplastic constitutive relationships, which integrate the effects of
   mean effective stress and hardening because of either plastic changes in
   volume or changes in the degree of saturation. The effective stress is
   defined as the sum of the net normal stress and the product of the
   effective saturation and matric suction, facilitating integration of the
   soil-water retention curve parameters into the model. An experimental
   testing program involving measurement of G(max) of compacted silt during
   hydraulic hysteresis was used to develop data to validate a methodology
   for model calibration. Specifically, hysteretic trends in G(max) were
   defined for different mean net normal stress values using a fixed-free
   resonant column device with suction-saturation control. The proposed
   methodology to define the model parameters includes use of correlations
   from the literature, as well as experimental measurements of G(max) for
   soils in saturated conditions and during drainage. The model was found
   to fit the trends in experimental G(max) data with suction, degree of
   saturation, and effective stress during drainage, and provided adequate
   prediction of the G(max) data upon subsequent imbibition. DOI:

Abstract = {{For many in the engineering community, nonductile concrete buildings are
   the next priority for seismic safety legislation in California. The
   history of such policies shows that implementation has been challenged
   by the high costs of seismic retrofit, opposition from building owners,
   and difficulty in defining and evaluating seismic safety standards. As a
   result, seismic legislation for existing buildings has developed in
   response to major earthquakes, rather than through proactive risk
   assessment. Advances in performance-based earthquake engineering provide
   a consistent framework for assessing building collapse risk using
   nonlinear dynamic analysis. These tools are applied to evaluate the risk
   of earthquake-induced collapse and fatalities in a representative set of
   older concrete frames. Results show that nonductile concrete frame
   buildings are about 35 times more likely to collapse in earthquakes than
   their modern counterparts. These assessments are used to investigate the
   impact of policy alternatives for seismic mitigation of nonductile

Abstract = {{Introduction: Current research indicates that chronic peripheral
   neuropathic pain includes a role for glia and the actions of
   proinflammatory factors. This review briefly discusses the glial and
   cytokine responses that occur following peripheral nerve damage in
   support of utilizing anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10)
   therapy to suppress chronic peripheral neuropathic pain. Spinal Nonviral
   Interleukin-10 Gene Therapy: IL-10 is one of the most powerful
   endogenous counter-regulators of proinflammatory cytokine function that
   acts in the nervous system. Subarachnoid (intrathecal) spinal injection
   of the gene encoding IL-10 delivered by nonviral vectors has several
   advantages over virally mediated gene transfer methods and leads to
   profound pain relief in several animal models. Nonviral gene delivery:
   Lastly, data are reviewed that nonviral deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)
   encapsulated by a biologically safe copolymer, poly(lactic-co-glycolic)
   acid (PLGA), thought to protect DNA, leads to significantly improved
   therapeutic gene transfer in animal models, which additionally and
   significantly extends pain relief. Conclusions: The impact of these
   early studies exploring anti-inflammatory genes emphasizes the
   exceptional therapeutic potential of new biocompatible intrathecal
   nonviral gene delivery approaches such as PLGA microparticles.
   Ultimately, ongoing expression of therapeutic genes is a viable option
   to treat chronic neuropathic pain in the clinic.}},

Abstract = {{We use generalized sheet transition conditions (GSTCs) to investigate
   the existence of guided waves (both surface waves and complex modes) on
   a metafilm: a surface distribution of electrically small scatterers
   characterized by electric and magnetic surface susceptibilities. In this
   paper, excitation of a metafilm by both electric and magnetic line
   currents is investigated. The characteristics of the guided waves for
   both these polarizations are expressed in terms of the surface
   susceptibilities, which are directly related to the electric and
   magnetic polarizabilities of the scatterers composing the surface. We
   will show that the guided waves can have unique behaviors (not found in
   classical slab configurations) for judicious choices of the scatterers
   in the metafilm. For example, unlike a conventional dielectric slab,
   forward and backward surface waves as well as complex modes can be
   excited simultaneously on the metafilm, a direct consequence of
   engineering the properties of the constituent scatterers. Two different
   classes of modes (even and odd) are possible on the metasurface. The odd
   mode is analogous to the surface plasmon polariton seen on some
   metamaterials, and under certain conditions, the even mode is analogous
   to the classical dielectric slab surface wave. In order to validate the
   predictions presented here, we present numerical results for an
   electric-line source placed above a metafilm composed of spherical
   particles. We also show comparisons of propagation constants obtained
   from our model to other analytical results found in the literature.
   Finally, we show that the results from our formulation reduce to
   analytical results given in the literature for a thin dielectric layer.}},

   the thermal conductivity of the composites shows a remarkable
   enhancement, which increases with the relative radius of the particles
   with respect to the coupling length. It is shown that the effect of
   electron-phonon coupling on the thermal conductivity of composites gets
   strength at high-volume fractions of particles and is cancelled out for
   high interfacial thermal resistances. The proposed model could be useful

Abstract = {{Alumina thin film structures were produced by coating high surface area
   polymer particles via atomic layer deposition (ALD), using the polymer
   as a sacrificial template. Burnout of the polymer material left high
   surface area, high pore volume structures, with 15 nm wall thickness.
   Further deposition of up to 27 mol\% Co and Fe was performed via ALD to
   produce high surface area CoFe2O4 particles for thermochemical water
   splitting. The ALD particles were thermally cycled in electrically
   heated lab reactors and on-sun using a concentrated solar, reflective
   cavity reactor. Surface area measurements of cycled ALD particles showed
   improved surface area retention as compared to bulk Fe2O3 nanopowders.
   Reaction rates as high as 15.2 and 9.8 mu mol/s/g were observed, on-sun,
   for H2O and CO2 splitting respectively. Thermochemical cycling in a
   concentrated solar cavity reactor showed an order of magnitude increase

Abstract = {{Optimal reconfigurations of a two-spacecraft coulomb formation are
   determined by applying nonlinear optimal control techniques. The
   objective of these reconfigurations is to maneuver the two-craft
   formation between two charged equilibria configurations. The four
   optimality criteria considered are minimum time, minimum acceleration of
   the separation distance, minimum electric propulsion fuel usage, and
   minimum electrical power consumption. The reconfiguration between
   equilibria is first considered by varying the desired separation
   distance. In a radial relative equilibrium configuration, only the
   coulomb force is required to control the in-plane motion and to steer
   the satellites from their initial to their final radial position. In
   this reconfiguration maneuver, the gravity gradient torque is exploited
   to stabilize the in-plane motion. For along-track and orbit-normal
   equilibrium locations, the reconfiguration maneuver requires hybrid
   controls. Here the coulomb force is varied to control the separation
   distance and inertial microthrusters are activated for control in the
   transverse directions. Second, a reconfiguration involving hybrid
   control is used to maneuver the crafts from any initial equilibrium
   position to a final one. The goal is to determine optimal maneuvers
   maximizing the use of coulomb propulsion while minimizing the electric
   propulsion usage. The two-point boundary-value problem optimization
   formulation is numerically solved via pseudospectral methods.
   Pontryagin's minimum principle verifies the open-loop solutions'
   optimality.}},

Abstract = {{We report our recent progress toward the development of microwave
   brightness-temperature (BT) standards. As one of the crucial parameters,
   the target illumination efficiency (IE) was traditionally determined
   from the relative antenna pattern. We propose a measurement technique to
   extract the target IE solely by the use of passive radiometric
   measurements for characterizing the BT of the blackbody radiator. Such a
   technique allows us to skip the complexities that are often encountered
   during the measurement and calculation of the antenna pattern. Taking
   advantage of the variable heating capability available on most blackbody
   targets, we varied the temperature of a heated blackbody target and ran
   a series of radiometric measurements when the target was separated at
   different distances away from the the antenna with the radiometer
   operating at a few frequencies. Our experimental results show excellent
   measurement accuracy on the IE, with uncertainty of about 1\% at close
   separation distance between the antenna and the target. We further
   measured and computed the BT of the blackbody target at the locations
   where we had measured the extracted IE. The BT was slightly lower than
   the physical temperature of the target and exhibited 0.7 K to about 1 K
   uncertainty when the target was located no more than 1 m away from the
   antenna. A measurement uncertainty of 1 K already meets the accuracy
   requirements of some climate variables, and such results reflect a
   significant step toward the establishment of BT standards at microwave
   frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of compounds showing a very low molecular weight (i.e.
   < 200 Da) can be complicated when low-resolution mass spectrometry is
   used in the selected-reaction monitoring mode, since the possible number
   of product ions is reduced and the obtained reactions are not selective
   enough to overcome background noise and/or matrix interferences. In this
   study, the use of high-resolution mass spectrometry based on Exactive
   Orbitrap was applied for the determination of a group of polar
   organophosphonate pesticides and transformation products (TPs), which
   show the aforementioned features, in agricultural soils. Namely,
   glyphosate, glufosinate, ethephon and their TPs, aminomethyl phosphonic
   acid (AMPA), 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid, N-acetyl-glufosinate and
   2-hydroxyethylphosphonic acid were analyzed. The {[}M-H]- ions
   168.00564, 180.04202, 142.96593, 110.00016, 151.01547, 222.05259 and
   124.99982 were used, respectively, for the detection and identification
   of the compounds. Confirmation was carried out by using accurate mass
   measurements of ion fragments for each compound, from neutral losses of
   CO2, H2O and H2CO (formaldehyde). Furthermore, the recently reported
   tool, relative isotopic mass defect (R Delta m), was also used to
   support the confirmation protocol. The optimized method was fully
   validated at low levels, including the estimation of a not commonly used
   parameter: the limit of confirmation (LOC). This LOC is expressed as the
   lowest concentration of compound that can be confirmed using a fragment
   or the R?m, and it ranged from 10 to 50 mu g kg-1 for all compounds. All
   the data was obtained in a single injection. Finally, the method was
   applied to real soil samples, and glyphosate and AMPA were found at 265
   mu g kg-1 and 105 mu g kg-1, respectively. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Recent clinical studies of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have
   found correlations between increased pulmonary vascular stiffness (PVS)
   and poorer disease outcomes. However, mechanistic questions remain about
   the relationships amongst PVS, RV power, and vascular hemodynamics in
   the setting of progressive PAH that are difficult or impossible to
   answer using direct measurements. Clinically validated patient-specific
   computational modeling may allow exploration of these issues through
   perturbation-based predictive testing.
   Here we use a simple patient-specific model to answer four questions:
   how do hemodynamics change as PAH worsens? How does increasing PVS
   impact hemodynamics and RV power? For a patient with moderate PAH, what
   are the consequences if the pressures increase modestly yet sufficiently
   to engage collagen in those vessels? What impact does pressure-reducing
   vasodilator treatment have on hemodynamics?
   Twenty-one sets of model-predicted impedance and mean PA pressure (mPAP)
   show good agreement with clinical measurements, thereby validating the
   model. Worsening was modeled using data from three PAH outcomes groups;
   these show not only the expected increase in mPAP, but also an increase
   in pressure pulsatility. Interestingly, chronically increasing mPAP
   decreased WSS, suggesting that increased PA cross-sectional area
   affected WSS greater than increased PVS. For a patient with moderately
   high PVR (12.7 WU) with elastin-based upstream vascular remodeling,
   moving from elastin-dominant vessel behavior to collagen-dominant
   behavior caused substantial increases in mPAP, pressure and WSS
   pulsatility. For the same patient, reducing PVR through a simulated
   vasodilator to a value equivalent to mild PAH did not decrease pressure
   pulsatility and dramatically increased WSS pulsatility.
   Overall, these results suggest a close association between PVS and
   hemodynamics and that hemodynamics may play an important role in
   progressing PAH. These support the hypothesis that treatments should
   target decreasing or reversing upstream vascular remodeling in addition
   to decreasing mean pressures. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Membranes act as selective barriers and play an important role in
   processes such as cellular compartmentalization and industrial-scale
   chemical and gas purification. The ideal membrane should be as thin as
   possible to maximize flux, mechanically robust to prevent fracture, and
   have well-defined pore sizes to increase selectivity. Graphene is an
   excellent starting point for developing size-selective membranes(1-8)
   because of its atomic thickness(9), high mechanical strength(10),
   relative inertness and impermeability to all standard gases(11-14).
   However, pores that can exclude larger molecules but allow smaller
   molecules to pass through would have to be introduced into the material.
   Here, we show that ultraviolet-induced oxidative etching(15,16) can
   create pores in micrometre-sized graphene membranes, and the resulting
   membranes can be used as molecular sieves. A pressurized blister test
   and mechanical resonance are used to measure the transport of a range of
   gases (H-2, CO2, Ar, N-2, CH4 and SF6) through the pores. The
   experimentally measured leak rate, separation factors and Raman spectrum
   agree well with models based on effusion through a small number of

   species that polymerize at different rates. By selectively exposing
   different areas of a device for various amounts of time, we can select
   the state of the polymer (i.e. liquid, rubbery, or glassy) to create
   fluid channels or optical index structures such as waveguides. Using
   only three exposure steps and two masks, we demonstrate an integrated
   refractometer with a 90 channel-waveguide crossing to illustrate the
   fabrication process and the ability to create lithographically aligned

Abstract = {{An analytical treatment has been presented for the lateral response of a
   rigid circular disc embedded in a transversely isotropic half-space. By
   means of a complete representation of using displacement potentials, it
   is shown that the governing equations of equilibrium for this class of
   problems can be uncoupled into two fourth-order partial differential
   equations. Using cylindrical co-ordinate system and applying Hankel
   integral transform in the radial direction and Fourier series, the
   problem may be changed to a system of four separate integral equations,
   which, in turn, are reduced to a pair of Fredholm equation of the second
   kind, whose solutions are then computed. In addition to furnishing a
   unified view of existing solutions for zero and infinite embedments, the
   present treatment reveals a severe boundary-layer phenomenon, which is
   apt to be of interest to this class of problems in general. The present
   solutions are analytically and numerically in exact agreement with the
   existing solutions for a half-space with isotropic material properties.
   To confirm the accuracy of the numerical evaluation of the integrals
   involved, numerical results are included for cases of different degrees
   of the material anisotropy. The contact pressure, desired
   force-displacement relationship, stress and displacement field are
   explicitly found.}},

Abstract = {{The DielsAlder (DA) reaction between maleimide and furan moieties
   possessing various substitutions was performed as a means for developing
   predictive capabilities for temperature and conversion-dependent
   material properties in networks comprised of DA moieties. Using HNMR
   spectroscopy, the reactions of maleimide- and furan-containing molecules
   further functionalized with carboxylic acids were monitored to ascertain
   the impact that substitutional changes had on the thermodynamic and
   kinetic behavior of the DA reaction. The reaction rate and equilibrium
   conversion of the furan and maleimide increased when the carboxylic acid
   functional group directly connected to the furan ring was moved from the
   two to the three position. When an aliphatic two-carbon spacer was used,
   such that the p-electrons of the carboxylic acid and furan were no
   longer conjugated, the reaction rate increased further. We also report
   the reactivity effect on the distance between the carboxylic acid
   functional group and the maleimide, which yielded little impact on the
   reaction rate but exhibited increased equilibrium conversion with
   increasing distance. Additionally, the impact on the kinetic and
   thermodynamic properties of coupling the carboxylic acid to another
   molecule, tert-butyl glycine, was also determined. When the carboxylic
   acid was coupled to an amine, the DA reaction between the furan and
   maleimide was generally found to have similar kinetic and thermodynamic
   behavior as compared to their uncoupled, carboxylic acid equivalents.
   Thus, the characterized and tabulated kinetic and thermodynamic data
   presented herein enables the prediction of a broad set of
   temperature-dependent chemical and material properties. Finally, we
   discuss practical limitations and nuances of the DA reaction, such as
   the potential for the maleimide to ring-open in aqueous media via
   hydrolysis. (c) 2012 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J,

Abstract = {{A series of nanogel compositions were prepared from urethane
   dimethacrylate (UDMA) and isobornyl methacrylate (IBMA) in the presence
   of a thiol chain transfer agent. The linear oligomer of IBMA was
   synthesized by a similar solution polymerization technique. The nanogels
   were prepared with different crosslinker concentrations to achieve
   varied branching densities and molecular weights. The prepolymers were
   dispersed in triethylene glycol dimethacrylate at loading levels ranging
   from 10 wt.\% to 50 wt.\%. Photopolymerization reaction kinetics of all
   prepolymer modified systems were enhanced relative to the nanogel-free
   control during early stage polymerization while limiting conversion was
   similar for most samples. Volumetric polymerization shrinkage was
   reduced proportionally with the prepolymer content while the
   corresponding decrease in polymerization stress was potentially greater
   than an additive linear behavior. Flexural strength for inert linear
   polymer-modified systems decreased significantly with the increase in
   the prepolymer content; however, with an increase in the crosslinker
   concentration within the nanogel additives, and an increase in the
   concentration of residual pendant reactive sites, flexural strength was
   maintained or improved regardless of the nanogel loading level. This
   demonstrates that covalent attachment rather than just physical
   entanglement with the polymer matrix is important for effective polymer
   mechanical reinforcement by nanogel additives. Reactive nanogel
   additives can be considered as a practical, generic means to achieve
   substantial reductions in polymerization shrinkage and shrinkage stress
   in common polymers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The two-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) interference and
   cognitive radio channels are considered, where the ith transmitter and
   the ith receiver have M-i and N-i antennas, respectively. In particular,
   the degrees of freedom (DoF) regions of these channels are studied under
   the assumption of having no channel state information at the
   transmitters. Making certain assumptions about the distributions of
   channel matrices of increasing generality respectively, Huang et al.,
   Zhu and Guo, and the authors of this paper characterized the DoF region
   of the MIMO interference channel for all values of the four-tuple, (M-1,
   M-2, N-1, N-2), except when min (M-1, N-1) > N-2 > M-2 or. min(M-2, N-2)
   > N-1 > M-1. More recently, for isotropic fading distributions, Zhu and
   Guo have solved this latter case by providing a tight outer bound to the
   DoF region. Here, a simpler and more widely applicable proof of that
   outer bound is given based on the idea of interference localization.
   Using the same idea, under Rayleigh fading, the DoF region is then also
   established for the MIMO cognitive radio channel (when the second
   transmitter is cognitive) with min (M-1 + M-2, N-1) > N-2 > M-2-the only
   class for which the inner and outer bounds previously reported by the
   authors were not tight-thereby completing the DoF region
   characterization of this channel under Rayleigh fading for all values of
   (M-1, M-2, N-1, N-2).}},

Abstract = {{Single-layer and bilayer four-arm spiral antennas and their feeding
   methods for Mode 1 operation are discussed in this article. Important
   design parameters such as metal-to-slot ratio and growth rate for better
   impedance matching and reduced far-field contamination are studied.
   Three feeding methods for Mode 1 operation are compared: a bundle of
   four coaxial cables for a single-layer spiral and vertical and
   horizontal feeds by two coaxial cables for bilayer spirals. It is shown
   that the single-layer spiral maintains beam symmetry with Wobble on Wave
   better than 1 dB at ? = 30 degrees over 10:1 bandwidth. However, the
   required beamformer is complex and expensive. Proposed, horizontally and
   vertically fed bilayer spirals need simpler beamformer while maintaining
   similar far-field performance over narrower 6:1 and 2:1 bandwidths,
   respectively, thus making them useful for many wideband applications.
   Modeling is conducted by a method of moments and validated with a finite

Abstract = {{Objective: The objectives for this study were to determine whether
   radical initiated photopolymerizations typically employed for cell
   encapsulations lead to oxidative stress incurred by chondrocytes and
   whether the development of a pericellular matrix (PCM) decreases this
   oxidative stress and has longer-term benefits on chondrocyte function.
   Methods: Freshly isolated bovine chondrocytes were encapsulated in
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hythogels devoid of a PCM or with a PCM,
   confirmed by immunocytochemistry (IC), and cultured for up to 2 weeks.
   Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and damage to cell membrane by
   lipid peroxidation were accomplished using
   carboxy-2,7-difluorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (carboxy-H(2)DFFDA) and
   by malondialdehyde (MDA) content, respectively. Gene expression and
   proteoglycan synthesis were analyzed using reverse transcription
   (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) and (SO4)-S-35 incorporation, respectively.
   Results: The photopolymerization reaction, which alone generates
   radicals and extracellular ROS, led to oxidative stress in chondrocytes
   evidenced by increased intracellular ROS and lipid peroxidation. The
   presence of a PCM decreased intracellular ROS and abrogated membrane
   lipid peroxidation, improved aggrecan, collagen II and collagen VI
   expression, and enhanced proteoglycan synthesis.
   Conclusions: The development of the PCM prior to photoencapsulation in
   PEG hydrogels reduces oxidative stress and improves chondrocyte anabolic
   activity. Our data suggest this reduction occurs by decreased ROS
   diffusion into the cell and decreased membrane damage. Our findings
   suggest that minimizing oxidative stress, such as through the presence
   of a PCM, may have long-term beneficial effects on tissue elaboration
   when employing photopolymerizations to encapsulate chondrocytes for
   cartilage tissue engineering applications. (C) 2012 Osteoarthritis

Title = {{Novel dental restorative materials having low polymerization shrinkage
   stress via stress relaxation by addition-fragmentation chain transfer}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3-9}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. To produce a reduced stress dental restorative material
   while simultaneously maintaining excellent mechanical properties, we
   have incorporated an allyl sulfide functional group into
   norbornene-methacrylate comonomer resins. We hypothesize that the
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) enabled by the presence of
   the allyl sulfide relieves stress in these methacrylate-based systems
   while retaining excellent mechanical properties owing to the high glass
   transition temperature of norbornene-containing resins.
   Methods. An allyl sulfide-containing dinorbornene was stoichiometrically
   formulated with a ring-containing allyl sulfide-possessing methacrylate.
   To evaluate the stress relaxation effect as a function of the allyl
   sulfide concentration, a propyl sulfide-based dinorbornene, not capable
   of addition-fragmentation, was also formulated with the methacrylate
   monomer. Shrinkage stress, the glass transition temperature and the
   elastic modulus were all measured. The composite flexural strength and
   modulus were also measured. ANOVA (CI 95\%) was conducted to determine
   differences between the means.
   Results. Increasing the allyl sulfide content in the resin dramatically
   reduces the final stress in the norbornene-methacrylate systems. Both
   norbornene-methacrylate resins demonstrated almost zero stress (more
   than 96\% stress reduction) compared with the conventional BisGMA/TEGDMA
   70/30 wt\% control. Mechanical properties of the allyl sulfide-based
   dental composites were improved to the point of being statistically
   indistinguishable from the control BisGMA-TEGDMA by changing the molar
   ratio between the methacrylate and norbornene functionalities.
   Significance. The allyl sulfide-containing norbornene-methacrylate
   networks possessed super-ambient T-g, and demonstrated significantly
   lower shrinkage stress when compared with the control (BisGMA/TEGDMA
   70-30 wt\%). Although additional development remains, these low stress
   materials exhibit excellent mechanical properties which are appropriate
   for use as dental restorative materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Abstract = {{Synthetic extracellular matrices provide a framework in which cells can
   be exposed to defined physical and biological cues. However no method
   exists to manipulate single cells within these matrices. It is desirable
   to develop such methods in order to understand fundamental principles of
   cell migration and define conditions that support or inhibit cell
   movement within these matrices. Here, we present a strategy for
   manipulating individual mammalian stem cells in defined synthetic
   hydrogels through selective optical activation of Rac, which is an
   intracellular signaling protein that plays a key role in cell migration.
   Photoactivated cell migration in synthetic hydrogels depended on
   mechanical and biological cues in the biomaterial. Real-time hydrogel
   photodegradation was employed to create geometrically defined channels
   and spaces in which cells could be photoactivated to migrate. Cell
   migration speed was significantly higher in the photo-etched channels
   and cells could easily change direction of movement compared to the bulk
   hydrogels. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-OCEANS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{OCT 31}},
Abstract = {{We present a new method for reconstructing sea level involving
   cyclostationary empirical orthogonal functions (CSEOFs). While we show
   results from a CSEOF reconstruction using basis functions computed from
   satellite altimetry and subsequently fit to tide gauge data, our focus
   is on how other ocean observations such as sea surface temperature can
   be leveraged to create an improved reconstructed sea level data set
   spanning the time period from 1900 to present. Basis functions are
   computed using satellite measurements of sea surface temperature, and
   using a simple regression technique, these basis functions are
   transformed to represent a similar temporal evolution to corresponding
   satellite altimeter-derived sea level basis functions. The resulting sea
   level and sea surface temperature basis functions are fit to tide gauge
   data and historical sea surface temperature data, respectively, to
   produce a reconstructed sea level data set spanning the period from 1900
   to present. We demonstrate the use of this reconstructed data set for
   climate monitoring, focusing primarily on climate signals in the Pacific
   Ocean. The CSEOF reconstruction technique can be used to create indices
   computed solely from sea level measurements for monitoring signals such
   as the eastern Pacific (EP) El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), central
   Pacific (CP) ENSO, and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The EP ENSO,
   CP ENSO, and PDO signals are all well represented in the CSEOF
   reconstruction relying solely on sea level measurements from 1950 to
   present; however, significant improvement can be made in reconstructing
   these signals during the first half of the twentieth century by
   including sea surface temperature measurements in the sea level
   reconstruction procedure.}},

Abstract = {{Gas-filled microbubbles are potentially useful theranostic agents for
   magnetic resonance imaging-guided focused ultrasound surgery (MRIgFUS).
   Previously, MRI at 9.4 T was used to measure the contrast properties of
   lipid-coated microbubbles with gadolinium (Gd(III)) bound to lipid
   headgroups, which revealed that the longitudinal molar relaxivity (r(1))
   increased after microbubble fragmentation. This behavior was attributed
   to an increase in water proton exchange with the Gd(III)-bound lipid
   fragments caused by an increase in the lipid headgroup area that
   accompanied the lipid shell monolayer-to-bilayer transition. In this
   article, we explore this mechanism by comparing the changes in r(1) and
   its transverse counterpart, r(2){*}, after the fragmentation of
   microbubbles consisting of Gd(III) bound to two different locations on
   the lipid monolayer shell: the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) lipid
   headgroup region or the distal region of the poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
   brush. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) at 1.5 T was used to measure the
   contrast properties of the various microbubble constructs because this
   is the most common field strength used in clinical MAL Results for the
   lipid-headgroup-labeled Gd(III) microbubbles revealed that r(1)
   increased after microbubble fragmentation, whereas r(2){*} was
   unchanged. An analysis of PEG-labeled Gd(III) microbubbles revealed that
   both r(1) and r(2){*} decreased after microbubble fragmentation. Further
   analysis revealed that the microbubble gas core enhanced the transverse
   MR signal (T-2{*}) in a concentration-dependent manner but minimally
   affected the longitudinal (T-1) signal. These results illustrate a new
   method for the use of NMR to measure the biomembrane packing structure
   and suggest that two mechanisms, proton-exchange enhancement by lipid
   membrane relaxation and magnetic field inhomogeneity imposed by the
   gas/liquid interface, may be used to detect and differentiate
   Gd(III)-labeled microbubbles and their cavitation fragments with MRI.}},

Abstract = {{A heated SiC microtubular reactor has been used to decompose
   acetaldehyde and its isotopomers (CH3CDO, CD3CHO, and CD3CDO). The
   pyrolysis experiments are carried out by passing a dilute mixture of
   acetaldehyde (roughly 0.1\%-1\%) entrained in a stream of a buffer gas
   (either He or Ar) through a heated SiC reactor that is 2-3 cm long and 1
   mm in diameter. Typical pressures in the reactor are 50-200 Torr with
   the SiC tube wall temperature in the range 1200-1900 K. Characteristic
   residence times in the reactor are 50-200 mu s after which the gas
   mixture emerges as a skimmed molecular beam at a pressure of
   approximately 10 mu Torr. The reactor has been modified so that both
   pulsed and continuous modes can be studied, and results from both flow
   regimes are presented. Using various detection methods (Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy and both fixed wavelength and tunable
   synchrotron radiation photoionization mass spectrometry), a number of
   products formed at early pyrolysis times (roughly 100-200 mu s) are
   identified: H, H-2, CH3, CO, CH2=CHOH, HC=CH, H2O, and CH2=C=O; trace
   quantities of other species are also observed in some of the
   experiments. Pyrolysis of rare isotopomers of acetaldehyde produces
   characteristic isotopic signatures in the reaction products, which
   offers insight into reaction mechanisms that occur in the reactor. In
   particular, while the principal unimolecular processes appear to be
   radical decomposition CH3CHO (+M) -> CH3 + H + CO and isomerization of
   acetaldehyde to vinyl alcohol, it appears that the CH2CO and HCCH are
   formed (perhaps exclusively) by bimolecular reactions, especially those
   involving hydrogen atom attacks. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Like atoms and molecules with directional interactions, anisotropic
   particles could potentially assemble into a much wider range of
   crystalline arrays and meso-structures than spherical particles with
   isotropic interactions. In this paper, the electric-field directed
   assembly of geometrically anisotropic particlescolloidal dimers is
   studied. Rich phase behavior and different assembly regimes are found,
   primarily arising from the broken radial symmetry in particles. The
   orientations of individual dimers depend on the frequency of the
   electric field, the ramping direction of frequency, and the salt
   concentration. The competition and balance between the hydrodynamic,
   electric, and Brownian torques determine the orientation of individual
   particles, while the competition between the electrohydrodynamic force
   and dipolar interaction determines the aggregation of aligned particles
   at a given experimental condition. The field distribution near the
   electrode is critical to understand the orientation and assembly
   behavior of colloidal dimers on a conducting substrate. This study also
   demonstrates the effectiveness, the reversibility, and potential
   opportunity of applying electric field to control the orientation and
   direct the assembly of non-spherical particles. In particular, two
   dimensional close-packed crystals of perpendicularly aligned dimers are
   obtained, which shows promise in fabricating 3D photonic crystals based
   on dimer-like colloids and field-directed display.}},

Abstract = {{The differential cross section for the production of direct photons in p
   + p collisions at root s = 200 GeV at midrapidity was measured in the
   PHENIX detector at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. Inclusive direct
   photons were measured in the transverse momentum range from 5: 5-25
   GeV/c, extending the range beyond previous measurements. Event structure
   was studied with an isolation criterion. Next-to-leading-order
   perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics calculations give a good description
   of the spectrum. When the cross section is expressed versus x(T), the
   PHENIX data are seen to be in agreement with measurements from other
   experiments at different center-of-mass energies.}},

Abstract = {{We have measured singly clamped cantilever mechanical-resonances in
   ensembles of as-grown gallium nitride nanowires (GaN NWs), from 12K to
   320 K. Resonance frequencies are approximately linearly dependent on
   temperature near 300K with relative shifts of 40 +/- 20 ppm/K,
   consistent with temperature-dependent elastic moduli. Below 100 K, we
   find that some GaN NWs have mechanical quality factors well above 400
   000, at mechanical resonance frequencies near 1 MHz. We also observe a
   correlation between increased amplitude of dissipation and increased
   temperature dependence of resonance frequencies. The microwave homodyne
   detection technique we use is simple, allows for the investigation of
   as-grown or processed NWs, and is sensitive enough to observe the
   thermal motion of individual NWs while providing for the simultaneous
   measurement of large ensembles of NW mechanical resonances. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional, steady state computational model coupling radiative
   transfer with fluid flow, heat transfer, mass transfer, and chemical
   reaction kinetics is developed to describe a solar receiver consisting
   of an array of five tubes enclosed within a specularly reflective
   cylindrical cavity with a windowed aperture. Radiation heat transfer is
   incorporated via a combination of ray tracing, Monte Carlo, and finite
   volume techniques. Steam gasification of entrained 42 nm acetylene black
   particles is considered and particle transport is described by an
   aerosol population balance featuring convection, Brownian motion, and
   thermophoretic diffusion. Maximum temperatures of 1813 K, 1343 K and
   1546 K are predicted for the center, front and back tubes respectively,
   with corresponding reaction conversion of 40\%, 2.5\% and 9.2\% for a
   solar power input of 6 kW and a carbon feed rate of 0.5 g/min.
   Temperature of the fluid/particle mixture tracks closely with that of
   the surrounding tube walls owing to radiative absorption by the
   particulate phase. Estimated solar-to-chemical receiver efficiency is
   limited by comparatively low temperatures achieved in outlying tubes and
   ranges between 1\% and 4\% with up to 9 kW solar power. Experimentally
   measured carbon conversion is compared with predictions from the
   theoretical model utilizing various sets of kinetic parameters available
   in the literature for steam gasification of petcoke, graphite, activated
   carbon and low ash coal char. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Computational modeling and on-sun model validation for a multiple tube
   solar reactor with specularly reflective cavity walls. Part 1: Heat

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional, steady state computational model coupling radiative
   transfer with convective and conductive heat transfer is developed to
   describe a solar receiver consisting of an array of five tubes enclosed
   within a specularly reflective cylindrical cavity with a windowed
   aperture. Ray trace modeling of the concentrating system provides the
   magnitude and direction of solar energy incident on the aperture.
   Transport of solar radiation in the cavity space is decoupled from all
   other transport processes occurring in the receiver and profiles of the
   absorbed solar energy are determined via a Monte Carlo technique
   requiring only the receiver geometry, solar profile at the aperture, and
   spectral directional optical properties. A finite volume method is
   utilized to account for thermal radiation emitted by heated surfaces and
   implemented in conjunction with a computational fluid dynamics model.
   Maximum temperatures of 1820 K, 1355 K and 1536 K are predicted for the
   center, front, and back tubes, respectively for a solar power input of 6
   kW though temperature gradients as high as 340 K develop between the
   front and back sides of the center tube. More than 79\% of the solar
   energy is absorbed by tube surfaces. Emission losses account for 11-25\%
   of the solar input whereas conductive heat losses account for 55-69\% of
   the solar input and arise predominantly from conduction along the tube
   length to cooled cavity walls. Average discrepancies between
   theoretically predicted and experimentally measured temperatures are 44
   K (4\%) for silicon carbide tubes and 21 K (2\%) for Inconel tubes over
   temperature ranges of, respectively, 600-1700 K and 700-1400 K. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Contractile cells are known to constantly probe and respond to their
   mechanical environment through mechanosensing. Although the very
   mechanisms responsible for this behavior are still obscure, it is now
   clear that cells make full use of cross-talks between mechanics,
   chemistry, and transport to organize their structure and generate
   forces. To investigate these processes, it is important to derive
   mathematical and numerical models that can accurately capture the
   interactions between cells and an underlying deformable substrate. The
   present paper therefore introduces a computational framework, based on
   the extended FEM (XFEM) and the level set method, to model the evolution
   of two-dimensional (plane stress) cells lying on an elastic substrate
   whose properties can be varied. Cells are modeled with a continuum
   mixture approach previously developed by the authors to describe key
   phenomena of cell sensing, such as stress fiber formation,
   mechanosensitive contraction, and molecular transport whereas
   cellsubstrate adhesion is formulated with a linear elastic cohesive
   model. From a numerical viewpoint, cell and substrate are discretized on
   a single, regular finite element mesh, whereas the potentially complex
   cell geometry is defined in terms of a level set function that is
   independent of discretization. Field discontinuities across the cell
   membrane are then naturally enforced using enriched shape functions
   traditionally used in the XFEM formulation. The resulting method
   provides a flexible platform that can handle complex cell geometries,
   can avoid expensive meshing techniques, and can potentially be extended
   to study cell growth and migration on an elastic substrate. In addition,
   the XFEM formalism facilitates the consideration of the cell's cortical
   elasticity, a feature that is known to be important during cell
   deformation. The proposed method is illustrated with a few biologically
   relevant examples of cellsubstrate interactions. Generally, the method
   is able to capture some key phenomena observed in biological systems and
   displays numerical versatility and accuracy at a moderate computational
   cost.Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   It is shown that, with the context of continuum Lagrangian kinematics,

   effects in solid mechanics. The present formulation is applicable to
   both linearized vibration analysis and nonlinear FSI transient analysis

Abstract = {{The effects of atmospheric gravity waves (AGWs) on Polar Mesospheric
   Cloud (PMC) evolution and brightness are studied using a two dimensional
   version of the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres
   (CARMA 2D). The primary objectives for doing CARMA modeling of AGW
   effects on PMCs are to address the question of whether AGWs can account
   for the rapid, orbit by orbit changes in cloud structure and brightness
   seen in overlapping regions from images of the Cloud Imaging and
   Particle Size (CIPS) experiment on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the
   Mesosphere (AIM) spacecraft. We present comparisons of PMC brightness
   changes between our numerical simulations and observations from the CIPS
   experiment. Previous modeling studies have indicated a much longer
   life-time for PMC than the 90 min between CIPS orbits. We present CARMA
   2D results showing dependence of ice particle growth and PMC brightness
   on AGW perturbation of background temperatures and water vapor
   concentrations. The model shows differences in brightness of PMCs due to
   differences in number of large ice particles depending on the scale and
   periods of the AGWs and also indicates that overall cloud brightness is
   a function of the wave period. While the maximum rate of change in PMC
   brightness from the model is still almost a factor of two less than the
   CIPS observed maximum rate of change in brightness, our study indicates
   that the variation in PMC brightness is in part due to the upward
   transport of water vapor into water depleted region by AGWs and the
   growth of ice particles from sub visual to visual and to larger sizes
   than they normally would have without AGWs. The presence of short period
   AGW cause periodic oscillations in cloud brightness about the no-AGW
   brightness while long-period AGW can temporarily increase the brightness
   of PMCs compared to the PMC brightness under no-AGW case. However, both
   the short-period and long-period AGW ultimately reduce the domain
   averaged PMC brightness in the long-term. This agrees with CIPS
   observations of generally dimmer PMCs in regions of high AGW activity.
   The seasonal variation in PMC albedos and the day to day variations seen
   in CIPS can be reproduced using a spectrum of short and long period AGW.}},

Pages = {{5224-5234}},

Abstract = {{Most conventional biological treatment wastewater treatment plants
   (WWTPs) contain nitrate in the effluent. Nitrate undergoes photolysis
   when irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light in the 200-240 and 300-325
   nm wavelength range. In the process of nitrate photolysis, nitrite and
   hydroxyl radicals are produced. Medium pressure mercury lamps emitting a
   polychromatic UV spectrum including irradiation below 240 nm are
   becoming more common for wastewater disinfection. Therefore, nitrified
   effluent irradiated with polychromatic UV could effectively become a de
   facto advanced oxidation (hydroxyl radical) treatment process. UV-based
   advanced oxidation processes commonly rely on addition of hydrogen
   peroxide in the presence of UV irradiation for production of hydroxyl
   radicals. This study compares the steady-state concentration of hydroxyl
   radicals produced by nitrate contained in a conventional WWTP effluent
   to that produced by typical concentrations of hydrogen peroxide used for
   advanced oxidation treatment of water. The quantum yield of hydroxyl
   radical production from nitrate by all pathways was calculated to be
   0.24 +/- 0.03, and the quantum yield of hydroxyl radicals from nitrite
   was calculated to be 0.65 +/- 0.06. A model was developed that would
   estimate production of hydroxyl radicals directly from nitrate and water
   quality parameters. In effluents with >5 mg-N/L of nitrate, the
   concentration of hydroxyl radicals is comparable to that produced by
   addition of 10 mg/L of H2O2. Nitrifying wastewater treatment plants
   utilizing polychromatic UV systems at disinfection dose levels can be
   expected to achieve up to 30\% degradation of some micropollutants by
   hydroxyl radical oxidation. Increasing UV fluence to levels used during
   advanced oxidation could achieve over 95\% degradation of some
   compounds. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Three types of linear thiol-functionalized siloxane oligomers and three
   types of ene-functionalized oligomers were synthesized and subsequently
   photopolymerized. Within each type of thiol-functionalized oligomer, the
   ratio of mercaptan repeat units to nonreactive phenyl repeat units was
   varied to manipulate both the crosslink density and the degree of
   secondary interactions through pp stacking. Similarly, the repeat units
   of the three ene-functionalized oligomers are composed of
   allyl-functional monomers, benzene-functional monomers, and
   octyl-functional monomers in varying ratios of benzene:octyl but with a
   constant fraction of allyl moieties. The structural composition of the
   siloxane oligomers plays a pivotal role in the observed material
   properties of networks formed through thiolene photopolymerization.
   Networks with a high concentration of thiol functionalities exhibit
   higher rubbery moduli, ultimate strengths, and Young's moduli than
   networks with lower thiol concentrations. Moreover, the concentration of
   functionalities capable of participating in secondary interactions via
   hydrogen bonding or pp stacking directly impacts the network glass
   transition temperature and elasticity. The combination of low crosslink
   density and high secondary interactions produces networks with the
   greatest toughness. Finally, the fraction of octyl repeats correlates
   with the hydrophobic nature of the network. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{The influence of climate change on rainfall patterns has the potential
   to alter stability of partially saturated soil slopes. Changes in
   rainfall patterns have a strong influence on stability of partially
   saturated soil slopes, which recently have resulted in shallow
   landslides. In this paper, slope stability is assessed using a
   monolithically-coupled finite element model for a deformable partially
   saturated soil subjected to surface infiltration of water. Numerical
   analysis solves for the matric suction distribution over a
   two-dimensional cross-section of a soil slope while varying
   permeability, and considering a surface layer of soil with different
   permeability. The formulation of hydraulic conductivity for a coupled
   analysis includes dependence on porosity and degree of saturation to
   illustrate the effects of water infiltration and deformation behavior in
   partially saturated soils. Numerical examples demonstrate that change in
   rainfall patterns may trigger slope instability earlier in the rainfall
   event than for rainfall events of the past. Assessment of these
   simulations can provide an indication of the potential influence of
   climate change on shallow landslides in many mountainous areas in South

Abstract = {{A straightforward methodology for the chromatographic separation and
   accurate mass identification of 100 pharmaceuticals including some of
   their degradation products was developed using liquid
   chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (LC/Q-TOF-MS). A table compiling the protonated or deprotonated exact
   masses for all compounds, as well as the exact mass of several fragment
   ions obtained by MS-MS is included. Excellent chromatographic separation
   was achieved by using 3.5 mu m particle size columns and a slow and
   generic 30-min gradient. Isobaric and isomeric compounds (same nominal
   mass and same exact mass, respectively) were distinguished by various
   methods. including chromatography separation, MS-MS fragmentation, and
   isotopic signal identification. Method reporting limits of detection
   ranged from 1 to 1000 ng/L, after solid-phase extraction of 100 mL
   aqueous samples. The methodology was successfully applied to the

Abstract = {{We use the combination of liquid
   chromatography/quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC/Q-TOF-MS)
   and urine metabolic profiling to find and identify the metabolites of
   dextromethorphan, a common over-the-counter (OTC) cough suppressant.
   Next, we use the combination of ion masses, their MS/MS fragmentation,
   and retention times to determine dextromethorphan and its metabolites in
   surface water impacted by wastewater. Prior to this study, neither
   dextromethorphan nor its metabolites have been reported in surface
   water; in spite of its common use in over 100 various OTC medications.
   We found that the concentration of the dextrorphan metabolite in surface
   water greatly exceeded the parent compound by factors of 5-10 times,
   which reflects the urine profile, where parent compound is approximately
   <2\% of the total excreted drug based on ion intensities. Urine
   profiling also indicated that glucuronide metabolites are major phase 2
   products (92\% of the total) in urine and then are completely hydrolyzed
   in wastewater to dextrorphan and N-demethyldextrorphan, which are phase
   1 metabolites-a ``kind of reversal{''} of human metabolism. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Age is a risk factor in developing osteoarthritis, but the link is not
   well understood. It is thought that age predisposes the tissue to
   osteoarthritis when other risk factors are involved, e.g. abnormal
   biomechanics. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypothesis that
   chondrocyte response to injurious loading is dependent on donor age.
   Bovine chondrocytes were selected as model cells and isolated from
   skeletally immature (juvenile, 1-3 weeks) or mature (adult, 2-3 years)
   cartilage to represent different aged donors. Juvenile and adult
   chondrocytes were encapsulated in identical 3D poly(ethylene glycol)
   hydrogels and subjected to an initial compressive impact load of 25.6
   +/- 7.5 kN/m(2) applied to 50\% strain. Under free swelling culture,
   adult chondrocytes exhibited higher intracellular ROS levels and
   catabolism, specifically collagen degradation, when compared to juvenile
   chondrocytes. In response to injurious load, adult chondrocytes
   responded with higher cell death, while juvenile chondrocytes responded
   with greater apoptosis and greater increases in intracellular ROS. With
   respect to anabolism and catabolism in response to injurious load, adult
   chondrocytes exhibited decreased aggrecan and collagen deposition, while
   juvenile chondrocytes exhibited decreased proteoglycan synthesis and
   increased collagen degradation. Overall, chondrocytes responded to
   injury regardless of age, but exhibited age-dependent responses with
   respect to anabolism and catabolism. These findings confirm that age
   influences how chondrocytes respond to abnormal biomechanical cues,
   warranting further study into the mechanisms of how cells, age, and
   injury contribute to the onset of osteoarthritis. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{708}},
Pages = {{128-148}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{In this work, experiments using a pendulum apparatus were conducted for
   two particles engaged in oblique, wetted collisions over a range of
   impact angles, impact velocities, coating thicknesses, liquid
   viscosities, particle materials, and particle radii. From previous
   studies on normal or head-on collisions, the two particles bounce apart
   if the Stokes number (a ratio of particle inertia to viscous forces)
   exceeds a critical value, whereas they stick together if the Stokes
   number is below this critical value. However, for oblique collisions, an
   additional outcome is observed at moderate Stokes numbers and impact
   angles, in which the spheres initially stick together, rotate as a
   doublet, and then separate due to centrifugal forces. We refer to this
   outcome as `stick-rotate-separate'. For subcritical Stokes numbers
   exhibiting this new outcome, the experimental results for the apparent
   coefficient of normal restitution and angle of rotation from impact to
   separation show only weak dependence on the fluid viscosity and
   thickness and the dry restitution coefficient, whereas they both
   decrease with increasing particle radius. These results are in contrast
   with those for supercritical Stokes numbers in which the spheres bounce
   upon impact. An accompanying theory based on lubrication forces, the
   glass transition of the liquid layer, and solid deformation and rebound
   agrees well with experimental results and gives insight into the
   observed trends.}},

Title = {{Quantifying radial diffusion coefficients of radiation belt electrons
   based on global MHD simulation and spacecraft measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{Radial diffusion is one of the most important acceleration mechanisms
   for radiation belt electrons, which can be enhanced from drift-resonant
   interactions with large-scale fluctuations of the magnetosphere's
   magnetic and electric fields (Pc5 range of ULF waves). In order to
   physically quantify the radial diffusion coefficient, D-LL, we run the
   global Lyon-Fedder-Mobarry (LFM) MHD simulations to obtain the mode
   structure and power spectrum of the ULF waves and validate the
   simulation results with available satellite measurements. The calculated
   diffusion coefficients, directly from the MHD fields over a Corotating
   Interaction Region (CIR) storm in March 2008, are generally higher when
   solar wind dynamic pressure is enhanced or AE index is high. In contrary
   to the conventional understanding, our results show that inside
   geosynchronous orbit the total diffusion coefficient from MHD fields is
   dominated by the contribution from electric field perturbations, rather
   than the magnetic field perturbations. The calculated diffusion
   coefficient has a physical dependence on mu (or electron energy) and L,
   which is missing in the empirical diffusion coefficient, D-LL(Kp) as a
   function of Kp index, and D-LL(Kp) are generally greater than our
   calculated D-LL during the storm event. Validation of the MHD ULF waves
   by spacecraft field data shows that for this event the LFM code
   reasonably well-reproduces the B-z wave power observed by GOES and
   THEMIS satellites, while the E-phi power observed by THEMIS probes are
   generally underestimated by LFM fields, on average by about a factor of
   ten.}},

Abstract = {{We report the measurement of direct photons at midrapidity in Au + Au
   collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV. The direct photon signal was
   extracted for the transverse momentum range of 4 GeV/c < pT < 22 GeV/c,
   using a statistical method to subtract decay photons from the inclusive
   photon sample. The direct photon nuclear modification factor R-AA was
   calculated as a function of p(T) for different Au + Au collision
   centralities using the measured p + p direct photon spectrum and
   compared to theoretical predictions. R-AA was found to be consistent
   with unity for all centralities over the entire measured pT range.
   Theoretical models that account for modifications of initial direct
   photon production due to modified parton distribution functions in Au
   and the different isospin composition of the nuclei predict a modest
   change of R-AA from unity. They are consistent with the data. Models
   with compensating effects of the quark-gluon plasma on high-energy
   photons, such as suppression of jet-fragmentation photons and
   induced-photon bremsstrahlung from partons traversing the medium, are
   also consistent with this measurement.}},

Abstract = {{Polycations are a promising class of nonviral DNA delivery agents that
   bind to negatively charged DNA and transfect the DNA into target cells.
   The architecture and chemistry of the polycation strongly affect
   polycation-DNA complexation and in turn the ability of polycations to
   transfect DNA into cells. Here we develop coarse-grained models and
   conduct Langevin dynamics simulations to understand how the architecture
   of lysine-based polycations affects their complexation with DNA-like
   polyanions. We first characterize the structure of linear polylysine and
   oligolysines grafted to a polyolefin backbone and then the structure of
   complexes (termed polyplexes) formed by these polycations with
   polyanions of varying flexibility. We find that increasing oligolysine
   graft length and decreasing graft spacing both increase the size and
   rigidity of the grafted oligolysines, although they remain less rigid
   than semiflexible linear polylysine. Increasing ionic strength or
   counterion valency reduces polycation size and most
   architecture-dependent effects. The effects of polycation architecture
   on polyplex size and flexibility are dependent on the charge ratio in
   the system. Polyp lex surface charge increases with increasing graft
   length or decreasing graft spacing.}},

Title = {{Improved snowmelt simulations with a canopy model forced with
   photo-derived direct beam canopy transmissivity}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{OCT 6}},
Abstract = {{The predictive capacity of a physically based snow model to simulate
   point-scale, subcanopy snowmelt dynamics is evaluated in a mixed conifer
   forest, southern Sierra Nevada, California. Three model scenarios each
   providing varying levels of canopy structure detail were tested.
   Simulations of three water years initialized at locations of 24
   ultrasonic snow depth sensors were evaluated against observations of
   snow water equivalent (SWE), snow disappearance date, and volumetric
   soil water content. When canopy model parameters canopy openness and
   effective leaf area index were obtained from satellite and
   literature-based sources, respectively, the model was unable to resolve
   the variable subcanopy snowmelt dynamics. When canopy parameters were
   obtained from hemispherical photos, the improvements were not
   statistically significant. However, when the model was modified to
   accept photo-derived time-varying direct beam canopy transmissivity, the
   error in the snow disappearance date was reduced by as much as one week
   and positive and negative biases in melt-season SWE and snow cover
   duration were significantly reduced. Errors in the timing of soil
   meltwater fluxes were reduced by 11 days on average. The optimum
   aggregated temporal model resolution of direct beam canopy
   transmissivity was determined to be 30 min; hourly averages performed no
   better than the bulk canopy scenarios and finer time steps did not
   increase overall model accuracy. The improvements illustrate the
   important contribution of direct shortwave radiation to subcanopy
   snowmelt and confirm the known nonlinear melt behavior of snow cover.}},

Abstract = {{Gas and fine particle (PM2.5) phase formic acid concentrations were
   measured with online instrumentation during separate one- month studies
   in the summer of 2010 in Los Angeles (LA), CA, and Atlanta, GA. In both
   urban environments, median gas phase concentrations were on the order of
   a few ppbv (LA 1.6 ppbv, Atlanta 2.3 ppbv) and median particle phase
   concentrations were approximately tens of ng/m(3) (LA 49 ng/m(3),
   Atlanta 39 ng/m(3)). LA formic acid gas and particle concentrations had
   consistent temporal patterns; both peaked in the early afternoon and
   generally followed the trends in photochemical secondary gases. Atlanta
   diurnal trends were more irregular, but the mean diurnal profile had
   similar afternoon peaks in both gas and particle concentrations,
   suggesting a photochemical source in both cities. LA formic acid
   particle/gas (p/g) ratios ranged between 0.01 and 12\%, with a median of
   1.3\%. No clear evidence that LA formic acid preferentially partitioned
   to particle water was observed, except on three overcast periods of
   suppressed photochemical activity. Application of Henry's Law to predict
   partitioning during these periods greatly under-predicted particle phase
   formate concentrations based on bulk aerosol liquid water content (LWC)
   and pH estimated from thermodynamic models. In contrast to LA, formic
   acid partitioning in Atlanta appeared to be more consistently associated
   with elevated relative humidity (i.e., aerosol LWC), although p/g ratios
   were somewhat lower, ranging from 0.20 to 5.8\%, with a median of 0.8\%.
   Differences in formic acid gas absorbing phase preferences between these
   two cities are consistent with that of bulk water-soluble organic carbon
   reported in a companion paper.}},

Title = {{Bright polar mesospheric clouds formed by main engine exhaust from the
   space shuttle's final launch}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{The space shuttle launched for the last time on 8 July 2011. As with
   most shuttle launches, the three main engines injected about 350 t of
   water vapor between 100 and 115 km off the east coast of the United
   States during its ascent to orbit. We follow the motion of this exhaust
   with a variety of satellite and ground-based data sets and find that (1)
   the shuttle water vapor plume spread out horizontally in all directions
   over a distance of 3000 to 4000 km in 18 h, (2) a portion of the plume
   reached northern Europe in 21 h to form polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs)
   that are brighter than over 99\% of all PMCs observed in that region,
   and (3) the observed altitude dependence of the particle size is
   reversed with larger particles above smaller particles. We use a one-
   dimensional cloud formation model initialized with predictions of a
   plume diffusion model to simulate the unusually bright PMCs. We find
   that eddy mixing can move the plume water vapor down to the mesopause
   near 90 km where ice particles can form. If the eddy diffusion
   coefficient is 400 to 1000 m(2)/s, the predicted integrated cloud
   brightness is in agreement with both satellite and ground-based
   observations of the shuttle PMCs. The propellant mass of the shuttle is
   about 20\% of that from all vehicles launched during the northern 2011
   PMC season. We suggest that the brightest PMC population near 70 degrees
   N is formed by space traffic exhaust.}},

Abstract = {{An extensive set of experiments were performed to determine the
   stability boundary for the longitudinal oscillation of steel spheres
   settling through Hydroxy Propyl Guar (HPG) contained in long vertical
   tubes, a phenomenon first reported by Mollinger, et al. (1999). Results
   are reported in d/D-pH parameter space, where d is the sphere diameter
   and D is the internal diameter of a tube. Longitudinal oscillations,
   which owe their existence to the self-healing nature of the gel, occur
   over the region 0.48 < d/D < 0.86 and 8.31 < pH < 8.82. We discover that
   the upper pH limit of this stability domain is linked to the HPG gel
   point. During the course of experimentation, additional instabilities in
   the form of high-frequency transverse oscillations or helical motions
   were discovered and documented. The pure transverse oscillations found
   in the domain 8.035 < pH < 8.31 and 0.9 < d/D < 0.6 result from the
   elastic nature of the guar in this region. For 6.25 < pH < 8.035
   transverse oscillations or stable descents are interspersed between
   bands of tight helical motion at large d/D and wide helical motion at
   low d/D. At the lowest value pH = 6.25 the guar is a Newtonian fluid,
   yet the spiral motion persists in small bands of d/D. We have verified,
   in the literature and through additional experiments using distilled
   water as the Newtonian liquid that the spiral motion of spheres falling
   inside vertical tubes does indeed exist.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous experiments have shown that contractile cells like fibroblasts
   adapt their internal structure to their microenvironment by generating
   and orienting a network of stress fibers (SFs). This phenomenon has been
   modeled in previous studies with stability analysis through calculation
   of the fiber's potential or strain energy, where SFs are assigned a
   constant elasticity. Recent experiments have shown that the elasticity
   in SFs is rate dependent, resulting in a different stress fiber
   organization under constant or cyclic stretching. Here, a
   thermodynamical model that describes the anisotropic polymerization of
   the contractile units into SFs via the calculation of the
   mechanochemical potential of the two constituents is proposed. The
   stretch-dependent part of the SF potential is made of two terms that
   describe the passive and active behavior of the SF. In this paper, it is
   shown that the contributions of these two terms vary widely under
   constant or cyclic stretching as the SFs exhibit a rate-dependent
   elasticity and lead to two very different anisotropic SF organizations.
   It is further demonstrated that the substrate stiffness as well as its
   Poisson's ratio and anisotropy play a crucial role in the formation and
   organization of the SFs, consistent with what has been observed in
   various experiments. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000430. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Thermokarst lakes on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau cause considerable
   thermal disturbance to the surrounding permafrost, giving rise to
   anomalous ground-temperature conditions and open-talik formation below
   some lakes. Using in situ data and information from monitoring of a
   representative thermokarst lake in the Beiluhe Basin, this study
   simulates the rate of talik development beneath the lake, the time taken
   for an open talik to form, and the rate of permafrost lateral thaw after
   open-talik formation. The simulation uses a simplified two-dimensional
   unsteady finite-element model for heat transfer with phase change under
   a cylindrical coordinate system. The results indicate that a bowl-shaped
   talik forms under the lake and that the talik thickness increases
   substantially over time. An open talik forms below the lake 733 years
   after the lake formed. The average maximum thaw rates at the top and
   bottom of permafrost beneath the lake before the open talik forms are
   5.8 cm year-1 and 0.7 cm year-1, respectively. By 1100 years after lake
   formation, permafrost beneath the central deep pool and shallow
   nearshore zone of the lake thaws completely and the heat-source effect
   caused by the lake becomes very limited. The volume of the open talik
   beneath the lake still increases gradually with time 1500 years after
   lake formation, but the increase is very limited. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Many permafrost maps in China have been compiled since the early 1960s.
   The scales of these maps range from the local (1:600 000) to the
   regional scale (1:10 000 000). The permafrost classification systems
   differ among these maps. The indices for permafrost classification used
   in these mapping projects include spatial continuity (areal extent) and
   thickness of the permafrost, air and ground temperatures and ground -ice
   content. All of those data have been retrieved, digitised and published
   in the Environmental and Ecological Science Data Center for West China.
   These maps represent the best understanding at the time regarding the
   distribution of permafrost in China and its changes over the past
   century. An updated map of permafrost in China, including frozen ground
   area, is also provided. The total area of permafrost in China is
   estimated at similar to 1.59 x 10(6) km(2) (glaciers and lakes
   excluded), and the area of seasonally frozen ground (excluding
   instantaneous frozen ground) is similar to 5.36 x 10(6) km(2). The total
   area of high-altitude (plateau and mountain) permafrost in China is
   similar to 1.35 x 10(6) km(2), the area of mountain permafrost is
   similar to 0.30 x 10(6) km(2) and the area of plateau permafrost is
   similar to 1.05 x 10(6)km(2). The latitudinal permafrost is located in
   the northern part of northeastern China, and its area is similar to 0.24
   x 10(6)km(2). Additionally, some suggestions are proposed for future
   mapping of permafrost in China. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

   refrigerator demonstrate a -3 dB bandwidth from 1.6 to 13 GHz. In a
   modified Ruthroff design, a small capacitor is integrated at the input
   as a direct-current block, making it suitable for biasing and matching

Abstract = {{Rising temperatures and declining water availability have influenced the
   ecological function of mountain forests over the past half-century. For
   instance, warming in spring and summer and shifts towards earlier
   snowmelt are associated with an increase in wildfire activity and tree
   mortality in mountain forests in the western United States(1,2).
   Temperature increases are expected to continue during the twenty-first
   century in mountain ecosystems across the globe(3,4), with uncertain
   consequences. Here, we examine the influence of interannual variations
   in snowpack accumulation on forest greenness in the Sierra Nevada
   Mountains, California, between 1982 and 2006. Using observational
   records of snow accumulation and satellite data on vegetation greenness
   we show that vegetation greenness increases with snow accumulation.
   Indeed, we show that variations in maximum snow accumulation explain
   over 50\% of the interannual variability in peak forest greenness across
   the Sierra Nevada region. The extent to which snow accumulation can
   explain variations in greenness varies with elevation, reaching a
   maximum in the water-limited mid-elevations, between 2,000 and 2,600 m.
   In situ measurements of carbon uptake and snow accumulation along an
   elevational transect in the region confirm the elevation dependence of
   this relationship. We suggest that mid-elevation mountain forest
   ecosystems could prove particularly sensitive to future increases in
   temperature and concurrent changes in snow accumulation and melt.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive antenna array processing is widely known to provide significant
   anti-interference capabilities within a Global Navigation Satellite
   Systems (GNSS) receiver. A main challenge in the quest for such receiver
   architecture has always been the computational/processing requirements.
   Even more demanding would be to try and incorporate the flexibility of
   the Software-Defined Radio (SDR) design philosophy in such an
   implementation. This paper documents a feasible approach to a real-time
   SDR implementation of a beam-steered GNSS receiver and validates its
   performance. This research implements a real-time software receiver on a
   widely-available x86-based multi-core microprocessor to process
   four-element antenna array data streams sampled with 16-bit resolution.
   The software receiver is capable of 12 channels all-in-view Controlled
   Reception Pattern Antenna (CRPA) array processing capable of rejecting
   multiple interferers. Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD)
   instructions assembly coding and multithreaded programming, the key to
   such an implementation to reduce computational complexity, are fully
   documented within the paper. In conventional antenna array systems,
   receivers use the geometry of antennas and cable lengths known in
   advance. The documented CRPA implementation is architected to operate
   without extensive set-up and pre-calibration and leverages Space-Time
   Adaptive Processing (STAP) to provide adaptation in both the frequency
   and space domains. The validation component of the paper demonstrates
   that the developed software receiver operates in real time with live
   Global Positioning System (GPS) and Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS)
   L1 C/A code signal. Further, interference rejection capabilities of the
   implementation are also demonstrated using multiple synthetic
   interferers which are added to the live data stream.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging research has largely focused on the identification of
   associations between brain activation and specific mental functions.
   Here we show that data mining techniques applied to a large database of
   neuroimaging results can be used to identify the conceptual structure of
   mental functions and their mapping to brain systems. This analysis
   confirms many current ideas regarding the neural organization of
   cognition, but also provides some new insights into the roles of
   particular brain systems in mental function. We further show that the
   same methods can be used to identify the relations between mental
   disorders. Finally, we show that these two approaches can be combined to
   empirically identify novel relations between mental disorders and mental
   functions via their common involvement of particular brain networks.
   This approach has the potential to discover novel endophenotypes for
   neuropsychiatric disorders and to better characterize the structure of
   these disorders and the relations between them.}},

   OBSERVATIONS
   Antarctica boasts one of the world's harshest environments. Since the
   earliest expeditions, a major challenge has been to characterize the
   surface meteorology around the continent. In 1980, the University of
   Wisconsin - Madison (UW-Madison) took over the U.S. Antarctic Program
   (USAP) Automatic Weather Station (AWS) program. Since then, the
   UW-Madison AWS network has aided in the understanding of unique
   Antarctic weather and climate. This paper summarizes the development of
   the UW-Madison AWS network, issues related to instrumentation and data
   quality, and some of the ways these observations have and continue to
   benefit scientific investigations and operational meteorology.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple lines of recent research indicate that iron pyrite (FeS2)
   requires a \{100\}-terminated crystal morphology in order to maintain
   semiconducting properties. Additionally, the large absorption
   coefficient of pyrite allows for the near complete absorption of above
   baud gap radiation in <50 nm layers. However, to our knowledge <50 nm
   pyrite nanocubes have yet to be isolated. Herein, we demonstrate the
   synthesis of similar to 37 nm phase pure pyrite nanocubes by
   manipulating the sulfur chemical potential and ligand environment of the
   system. Ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption spectroscopy gives a
   signal of resonant light scattering indicating strong electronic
   coupling between nanocubes, which may allow for nanocube films with
   superior electron mobility. The absorption spectroscopies of cubic and
   irregular nanocrystals are contrasted and compared with recent
   theoretical work in order to investigate the effect of shape on
   electronic properties. Specifically, nanocubes have been found to have
   absorption characteristics closer to theory as compared to irregular
   nanocrystals, especially for UV radiation: 250-350 nm. Pyrite nanocubes
   display an indirect band gap at similar to 1.1 eV in addition to two
   direct transitions at similar to 1.9 and similar to 3.0 eV, correlating
   well to theoretical values.}},

Title = {{Abrupt landscape change post-6 Ma on the central Great Plains, USA}},

Abstract = {{The principal control on landscape evolution in the central Great Plains
   of the United States over the past 10 m.y. is a contentious subject. New
   sedimentary data collected from Late Miocene Ogallala Group and Pliocene
   Broadwater Formation of the Nebraskan Great Plains demonstrates a
   twofold increase in the median grain size (from 20 mm to >40 mm)
   exported from the Rocky Mountains across the Miocene-Pliocene boundary.
   Paleoslope reconstructions derived from these data support the tilting
   of the Miocene Ogallala Group after 6 Ma, but demonstrate that the
   transport slope of the lower part of the unconformably overlying
   Pliocene succession is identical to the present-day slope. These data
   allow us to constrain the timing of differential uplift in the Great
   Plains to between 6 and 3.7 m.y.; the wavelength and short duration of
   this tilting are best explained by the initiation of localized dynamic
   topography. Our results also suggest a threefold to fourfold increase in
   specific stream power at this time, meaning that Pliocene rivers
   draining the central Rockies were considerably more competent than their
   Miocene predecessors. Incision during this period was not continuous. A
   significant episode of aggradation from 3.7 to 2.5 Ma is best explained
   by high rates of sediment supply relating to the warm, wet mid-Pliocene
   climate optimum. The modern pattern of incision on the Great Plains
   occurred from 2.5 Ma, and not from the end of the Miocene as is
   sometimes supposed, reflecting the onset of major Northern Hemisphere
   glaciation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a Taguchi-method-based approach that can quickly and
   accurately predict the operating performance of personalised ventilation
   (PV) systems using limited computational fluid dynamics simulation
   results. This method was used to optimise the operation characteristics
   (supply air temperature, velocity and flow rate) of a new PV air
   terminal device (ATD) design with the goal of achieving an overall best
   performance of thermal comfort, indoor air quality (IAQ) and energy
   efficiency. With the new ATD system, supply air temperature was found to
   have a significant influence on thermal comfort, IAQ and energy; volume
   flow rate was found to have a significant effect on IAQ and minor
   effects on thermal comfort and energy; and supply air velocity was found
   to have insignificant effects on all performance characteristics. Two
   new methods were developed to rapidly identify optimal system parameters
   for the best overall performance. Multiple solutions were obtained for
   the optimised system where improvements in thermal comfort, IAQ and
   energy performance were achieved in comparison to a system with mixing

Abstract = {{This paper reports a Si-Ti-Ni ternary alloy developed for commercial
   application as an anode material for lithium ion batteries. Our alloy
   exhibits a stable capacity above 900 mAh g-1 after 50 cycles and a high
   coulombic efficiency of up to 99.7\% during cycling. To enable a highly
   reversible nano-Si anode, melt spinning is employed to embed nano-Si
   particles in a Ti4Ni4Si7 matrix. The Ti4Ni4Si7 matrix fulfills two
   important purposes. First, it reduces the maximum stress evolved in the
   nano-Si particles by applying a compressive stress to mechanically
   confine Si expansion during lithiation. And second, the Ti4Ni4Si7 matrix
   is a good mixed conductor that isolates nano-Si from the liquid
   electrolyte, thus preventing parasitic reactions responsible for the
   formation of a solid electrolyte interphase. Given that a coulombic
   efficiency above 99.5\% is rarely reported for Si based anode materials,
   this alloy's performance suggests a promising new approach to
   engineering Si anode materials.}},

Abstract = {{Two wideband millimeter-wave end-fire log-periodic dipole array (LPDA)
   antennas are designed and fabricated using a sequential surface

   band rejection at 60 GHz. Antennas 1 and 2 are designed to operate in
   18-110 GHz and 18 GHz-50 GHz bands, and measured up to 40 GHz and 50
   GHz, respectively. VSWR < 2.5 is obtained for both antennas throughout
   the measured bandwidth. Measured directivity around 10 dBi and
   consistent E and H-plane 3 dB beamwidths around 56 degrees and 72
   degrees, respectively, are obtained for Antenna 2 throughout its

Abstract = {{Backscattered electron microscopy provides gray-level contrast resulting
   from variations in atomic composition. Through the use of reference
   materials, quantitative backscattered electron (qBSE) imaging can be
   used to measure the mineral content of mineralized tissues at submicron

   be adjusted for analysis of an individual tissue or a wide range of
   tissues with variable atomic density. As an alternative to conventional
   metallic reference materials, these amorphous materials maintain
   long-term stability and possess no long-range order that may induce
   channeling contrast. Using these reference materials, we characterized
   the mineral content of a broad range of mineralized tissues from
   immature mouse femur to whale bulla. Mineral volume fraction correlated
   to more traditional measurements of mineral content with microcomputed
   tomography and ashing techniques. Further, we demonstrate the advantage
   of location-matched measurements of nanomechanical properties and qBSE
   mineral content.}},

Abstract = {{Physics faculty agree on many of the skills and habits of mind they
   expect physics students to acquire by the end of their degree, including
   mathematical sophistication, problem-solving expertise, and an ability
   to work independently and become expert learners. What is less clear is
   how these outcomes are best achieved within the context of
   upper-division courses. Focusing on one key course in the career of an
   undergraduate major-junior-level Electricity \& Magnetism (E\&M)-we have
   investigated this critical question over the course of 4 years and
   across multiple universities and instructors. With the aim of educating
   our majors based on a more complete understanding of the cognitive and
   conceptual challenges of upper-division courses, we transformed
   junior-level E\&M using results and theory from education research. We
   present the process and content of the transformation and several
   measures of its success. Students and instructors enjoyed the new course
   materials. Students in courses using the new materials outperformed
   those in traditional lecture-based courses on a conceptual assessment
   and on some aspects of problem-solving, though not calculational skill.
   These results suggest that using student-centered methods at the
   upper-division can improve outcomes for many students. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Simulations of gravity-induced trapping of a deformable drop in a
   three-dimensional constriction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLLOID AND INTERFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{383}},
Pages = {{167-176}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{An efficient algorithm is developed to determine the three-dimensional
   shape of a deformable drop trapped under gravity in a constriction,
   employing an artificial evolution to a steady state. During the
   simulation, the drop surface is advanced using a rationally-devised
   normal ``velocity{''}, based on local deviation from the Young-Laplace
   equation and the adjacent solid shape, to approach the trapped drop
   shape. The artificial ``time-dependent{''} evolution of the drop to the
   static, trapped shape requires that the free portions of the drop
   interface eventually satisfy the Young-Laplace equation, and the
   drop-solid contact portions of the drop interface conform to the solid
   surface. The significant advantage of this solution method is that a
   simple, numerically-efficient ``velocity{''} is used to construct the
   evolution to the steady state; the coated areas where the drop is in
   near contact with solid boundaries of the constriction do not have to be
   specified a priori, but are found in the course of the solution.
   Alternative methods (e.g., boundary integral) based on realistic
   time-marching would be much more costly for determining the trapped
   state. Trapping conditions and drop shapes are studied for
   gravity-induced settling of a deformable drop into a three-dimensional
   constriction. For conditions near critical, where the trapped-drop
   steady state ceases to exist, severe surface-mesh distortions are
   treated by a combination of `passive mesh stabilization', mesh
   relaxation and topological mesh transformations through node
   reconnections. For Bond numbers above a critical value, the drop is
   deformable enough to pass through the hole of the constriction, with no
   trapping. Critical Bond numbers are determined by linearly fitting
   minima of the root-mean-squared (rms) surface velocities versus
   corresponding Bond numbers greater than critical, and then extrapolating
   the Bond number to where the minimum rms velocity is zero (i.e., the
   drop becomes trapped). For ring and hyperbolictube constrictions, with
   axes parallel to the gravity vector, the results for trapped drops and
   critical Bond numbers are in close agreement with those obtained by the
   previous, highly-accurate axisymmetric method {[}1]. Also, the
   three-dimensional Young-Laplace and boundary-integral methods show good
   agreement for the static shape of a drop trapped in a tilted
   three-sphere constriction. For all constriction types studied, including
   circular rings, hyperbolic tubes and agglomerates of three and four
   spheres, the critical Bond number increases nearly linearly with an
   increase in the drop-to-hole size ratio. In contrast, the constriction
   type and tilt angle, which is the angle between the gravity vector and
   the normal to the plane of the constriction hole, have generally a
   weaker effect on the critical Bond number. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We present detailed on-wafer scattering-parameter measurements and
   equivalent circuit modeling of a metal semiconductor field-effect
   transistor (MESFET) that incorporates a GaN nanowire (NW). A systematic
   procedure is established to extract intrinsic model parameters by
   removing extrinsic parameters of the NW under different bias conditions.
   All parameters are first determined from analytic formulas that
   establish their relationship to measured impedance and admittance
   parameters. The analytically determined parameters are then processed in
   a numerical fitting program and a circuit simulator for minimizing the
   difference between the modeled data and the experimental data. For
   demonstration, the proposed framework is applied to a GaN NW MESFET with
   1.5 mu m long gate up to 10 GHz. Its transconductance is estimated to be
   16.6 mu S, the transit time is estimated to be 9.8 ps and the maximum
   frequency of oscillation is about 16 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon (C) metabolism is at the core of ecosystem function. Decomposers
   play a critical role in this metabolism as they drive soil C cycle by
   mineralizing organic matter to CO2. Their growth depends on the
   carbon-use efficiency (CUE), defined as the ratio of growth over C
   uptake. By definition, high CUE promotes growth and possibly C
   stabilization in soils, while low CUE favors respiration. Despite the
   importance of this variable, flexibility in CUE for terrestrial
   decomposers is still poorly characterized and is not represented in most
   biogeochemical models. Here, we synthesize the theoretical and empirical
   basis of changes in CUE across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems,
   highlighting common patterns and hypothesizing changes in CUE under
   future climates. Both theoretical considerations and empirical evidence
   from aquatic organisms indicate that CUE decreases as temperature
   increases and nutrient availability decreases. More limited evidence
   shows a similar sensitivity of CUE to temperature and nutrient
   availability in terrestrial decomposers. Increasing CUE with improved
   nutrient availability might explain observed declines in respiration
   from fertilized stands, while decreased CUE with increasing temperature
   and plant C : N ratios might decrease soil C storage. Current
   biogeochemical models could be improved by accounting for these CUE
   responses along environmental and stoichiometric gradients.}},

Abstract = {{A novel particle feeding system capable of pneumatically dispensing
   dispersed particles at low and consistent feed rates has been developed.
   The feeder is based on a rotating brush that continually cleans the
   outlet orifice in a hopper filled with particles. The system was
   designed specifically for biomass particles that have been milled and
   sieved to less than 150 mu m as a feedstock for laboratory scale aerosol
   flow reactors. This feedstock often contains a large fraction of high
   aspect ratio particles that form obstructions in many conventional
   feeding systems. In addition to biomass, the feeder has successfully fed
   all particles less than 150 mu m that have been tested. Feed rates
   varying from 4.25 to 2420 mg/min have been obtained with spray dried
   algae at a constant carrier gas flow of 0.75 slpm, and steady and
   consistent feeding with milled switchgrass has been demonstrated. The
   design, construction, and preliminary testing of the feeding system are
   presented in this paper. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

   In this work, a tethered CE is developed with an active locomotion
   system for mobility within a collapsed lumen. Micro-patterned
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) treads are implemented onto a custom capsule
   housing as a mobility method. The tRCE housing contains a direct current
   (DC) motor and gear train to drive the treads, a video camera for visual
   feedback, and two light sources (infrared and visible) for illumination.
   The device was placed within the insufflated abdomen of a live
   anesthetized pig to evaluate mobility performance on a planar tissue
   surface, as well as within the cecum to evaluate mobility performance in
   a collapsed lumen. The tRCE was capable of forward and reverse mobility
   for both planar and collapsed lumen tissue environments. Also, using an
   onboard visual system, the tRCE was capable of demonstrating visual
   feedback within an insufflated, anesthetized porcine abdomen.
   Proof-of-concept in vivo tRCE mobility using micro-patterned PDMS treads
   was shown. This suggests that a similar method could be implemented in
   future smaller, faster, and untethered RCEs.}},

Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic Atomization (EHDA), also referred to as the
   electrospray process, has been recently developed to fabricate polymeric
   micro- or nano-particles as well as fibers for drug encapsulation. EHDA
   in the cone-jet mode can produce highly monodisperse aerosols. As a
   result of strong electric forces, liquid droplets can be created by the
   electrospray process and converted into solid particles. In this study
   EHDA was carried out in a glass chamber in which solid pharmaceutical
   particles were fabricated after evaporating the solvent from sprayed
   droplets. A high voltage nozzle with a concentric ring and a grounded
   collection plate were enclosed in an EHDA glass chamber. A modified
   design for the glass chamber was used in this study in which the
   particles are collected inside the chamber. The effects of different
   parameters on the particle collection efficiency were experimentally
   investigated. Important factors affecting the particle collection
   efficiency were the flow rate of the liquid solution used to create the
   particles, the nitrogen flow rate and the nozzle voltage. Systematic
   scaling analysis was conducted on the governing equations in the current
   EHDA system. The final results confirmed that the particle acceleration,
   gravitational and Saffman lift forces are not important in comparison to
   the electrical field and flow field forces for the EHDA apparatus and
   conditions used in this study. Furthermore, scaling analysis of the
   describing equations for the electrospray process permitted collapsing
   all the collection efficiency data onto a universal plot as a function
   of one dimensionless group that incorporates all the process parameters.
   This plot can be used to determine the effect on the collection
   efficiency of changing the liquid solution flow rate, nitrogen flow rate
   and nozzle voltage as well as geometrical parameters such as length and
   diameter of the chamber, and location of the collection plate. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Methods to precisely control growth factor presentation in a local and
   sustained fashion are of increasing interest for a number of complex
   tissue engineering applications. The cytokine transforming growth factor
   beta (TGF beta) plays a key role in promoting the chondrogenic
   differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Traditional
   chondrogenic approaches utilize soluble delivery, an approach with
   limited application for clinical translation. In this work, we introduce
   a reactive thiol onto TGF beta and covalently tether the growth factor
   into poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels using a photoinitiated thiol-
   acrylate polymerization mechanism. We demonstrate the bioactivity of
   thiolated TGF beta, before and after polymerization, using a SMAD2
   reporter cell line. hMSCs were encapsulated in PEG hydrogelswith and
   without tethered TGF beta, and subsequently assayed for
   glycosaminoglycan and collagen II production as indicators of
   chondrogenesis. Over a 21-day time course, tethered TGF beta promoted
   chondrogenesis at levels similar to a positive control using solubly
   dosed growth factor. These results provide evidence that tethered TGF
   beta materials can be successfully used to promote chondrogenic
   differentiation of MSCs.}},

Abstract = {{The reaction and coating kinetics for the glucose oxidase initiated
   interfacial polymerization are elaborated. The interfacial film grows
   rapidly and linearly with time, producing time-dependent controllable
   conformal coating thicknesses of up to a millimeter in less than 4 min.
   Bulk polymerization was only observed when the immersing media was
   stirred to induce higher mass transport rates. The dramatically
   different film thicknesses observed between different concentrations of
   glucose in the hydrogel and iron in the bulk media are demonstrated to
   be a result of an initial rapid growth phase following which the film
   grows at the same rate nearly independent of either the glucose or iron
   concentration. The polymerization rate and hence the thickness growth
   rate in this initial phase saturate at glucose and iron concentrations
   above 0.8 M and 0.63 mM, respectively. At iron concentrations above 0.05
   mM, the film thickness at the end of 3 h of reaction monotonically
   decreased with increasing iron concentration from 5.7 mm to 4.2 mm. The
   glucose oxidase is trapped by the growing polymerization front and can
   be used as the sole enzymatic precursor to coat a second polymeric
   layer. However, the rate of film growth of the second layer is 14-fold
   lower than the rate of film growth when bulk enzyme is present during
   the second stage coating process. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{4653-4664}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection is being increasingly used in drinking
   water treatment. It is important to understand how its application to
   different types of water may influence finished water quality,
   particularly as anthropogenic activity continues to impact the quality
   of source waters. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect
   of inorganic precursors on the formation of regulated and unregulated
   disinfection byproducts (DBPs) during UV irradiation of surface waters
   when combined with chlorination or chloramination. Samples were
   collected from three drinking water utilities supplied by source waters
   with varying organic and inorganic precursor content. The filtered
   samples were treated in the laboratory with a range of UV doses
   delivered from low pressure (LP, UV output at 253.7 nm) and medium
   pressure (MP, polychromatic UV output 200-400 nm) mercury lamps followed
   by chlorination or chloramination, in the presence and absence of
   additional bromide and nitrate. The regulated trihalomethanes and
   haloacetic acids were not affected by UV pretreatment at disinfection
   doses (40-186 mJ/cm(2)). With higher doses (1000 mJ/cm(2)),
   trihalomethane formation was increased 30-40\%. While most effects on
   DBPs were only observed with doses much higher than typically used for
   UV disinfection, there were some effects on unregulated DBPs at lower
   doses. In nitrate-spiked samples (1 -10 mg NIL), chloropicrin formation
   doubled and increased three- to six-fold with 40 mJ/cm(2) MP UV followed
   by chloramination and chlorination, respectively. Bromopicrin formation
   was increased in samples containing bromide (0.5-1 mg/L) and nitrate (1
   -10 mg NIL) when pretreated with LP or MP UV (30-60\% with 40 mJ/cm(2)
   LP UV and four- to ten-fold increase with 40 mJ/cm(2) MP UV, after
   subsequent chlorination). The formation of cyanogen chloride doubled and
   increased three-fold with MP UV doses of 186 and 1000 mJ/cm(2),
   respectively, when followed by chloramination in nitrate-spiked samples
   but remained below the World Health Organization guideline value of 70
   mu g/L in all cases. MP UV and high LP UV doses (1000 mJ/cm(2))
   increased chloral hydrate formation after subsequent chlorination
   (20-40\% increase for 40 mJ/cm(2) MP UV). These results indicate the
   importance of bench-testing DBP implications of UV applications in
   combination with post-disinfectants as part of the engineering
   assessment of a UV-chlorine/chloramine multi-barrier disinfection design
   for drinking water treatment. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   description of the dynamic response of the converter is employed, in the
   second part of this paper, to propose synthesis algorithms that can
   guarantee, a priori, the stability and performance requirements of the
   design. The resulting region of stability can take into account not only
   the bilinear terms but also the saturation of the control input, which
   is a topic of major importance in high-performance dc-dc converters. The
   aim of this paper is to contribute with a robust control framework which
   allows the designers to deal with the common requirements of regulated
   dc-dc converters. The correctness of the results has been verified both
   with numerical simulations and experimental measurements from dc-dc
   converter prototypes.}},

Abstract = {{Thiol-ene-based poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels provide a unique
   functional platform for the sustained and localized delivery of
   bioactive small molecules like glucocorticoids. As a proof of concept,
   the synthetic glucocorticoid Dexamethasone (Dex) was conjugated to the
   N-terminus of a matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-degradable peptide, which
   was then easily co-polymerized into PEG gel scaffolds by a thiol-ene
   polymerization mechanism. The conjugated Dex was locally sequestered
   until released by cleavage of the MMP-degradable peptide tether
   triggered by cell-secreted MMPs, and was only available for uptake by
   local co-encapsulated cells. Elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP)
   activities and calcium deposition levels were observed for human
   mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) that were encapsulated in PEG hydrogels
   functionalized with 10 mu M of a Dexamethasone-conjugated peptide
   (Dex-peptide). The cellular responses stimulated by the tethered Dex
   lasted for over 21 days. Using co-culture experiments, hMSCs
   encapsulated in hydrogels with the MMP-degradable Dex-peptides had
   elevated levels of ALP activity and calcium deposition, whereas no
   elevated cellular responses were observed in co-cultured hMSCs
   surrounding the gel. Moreover, modifying the peptide sequence to alter
   its susceptibility to cleavage and/or changing the Dex-peptide loading
   further regulated the hMSC response to Dex at different levels and on
   different time scales. Collectively, these results demonstrate a tunable
   system for the delivery of glucocorticoids in a localized and
   cell-dictated manner. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Non-reactive, thermoplastic prepolymers (poly- methyl, ethyl and butyl
   methacrylate) were added to a model homopolymer matrix composed of
   triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA) to form heterogeneous
   networks via polymerization induced phase separation (PIPS). PIPS
   creates networks with distinct phase structure that can partially
   compensate for volumetric shrinkage during polymerization through
   localized internal volume expansion. This investigation utilizes purely
   photo-initiated, free-radical systems, broadening the scope of
   applications for PIPS since these processing conditions have not been
   studied previously.
   The introduction of prepolymer into TEGDMA monomer resulted in stable,
   homogeneous monomer formulations, most of which underwent PIPS upon
   photo-irradiation, creating heterogeneous networks. During
   polymerization the presence of prepolymer enhanced autoacceleration,
   allowing for a more extensive ambient cure of the material. Phase
   separation, as characterized by dynamic changes in sample turbidity, was
   monitored simultaneously with monomer conversion and either preceded or
   was coincident with network gelation. Dynamic mechanical analysis shows
   a broadening of the tan delta peak and secondary peak formation,
   characteristic of phase-separated materials, indicating one phase rich
   in prepolymer and another depleted form upon phase separation. In
   certain cases, PIPS leads to an enhanced physical reduction of
   volumetric shrinkage, which is attractive for many applications
   including dental composite materials. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Understanding the impact of dam-triggered land use/land cover change on
   the modification of extreme precipitation}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{Two specific questions are addressed in this study regarding dams
   (artificial reservoirs). (1) Can a dam (artificial reservoir) and the
   land use/land cover (LULC) changes triggered by it physically alter
   extreme precipitation? The term extreme precipitation (EP) is used as a
   way of representing the model-derived upper bound of precipitation that
   pertains to the engineering definition of the standard probable maximum
   precipitation (PMP) used in design of dams. (2) Among the commonly
   experienced LULC changes due to dams, which type of change leads to the
   most detectable alteration of extreme precipitation? The American River
   Basin (ARW) and the Folsom dam were selected as a study region. Four
   scenarios of LULC change (comprising also various reservoir surface
   areas) were analyzed in a step by step fashion to elucidate the scenario
   leading to most significant impact on EP. The Regional Atmospheric
   Modeling System (RAMS, version 6.0) was used to analyze the impact of
   these LULC scenarios in two modes. In the first mode (called normal),
   the probable precipitation pattern due to each LULC scenario was
   identified. The second mode (called moisture-maximized), the PMP pattern
   represented from a 100\% relative humidity profile was generated as an
   indicator of extreme precipitation (EP). For the particular case of ARW
   and Folsom dam, irrigation was found as having the most detectable
   impact on EP (a 5\% increase in 72 h total for the normal mode and a 3\%
   increase for the moisture-maximized mode) in and around the ARW
   watershed. Doubling the reservoir size, on the other hand, brought only
   a small change in EP. Our RAMS-simulated results demonstrate that LULC
   changes driven by surrounding landscape alteration resulting from the
   dams can, in fact, alter the local to regional hydrometeorology as well
   as extreme precipitation. There is a strong possibility of a positive
   feedback mechanism initiated by irrigated landscapes located upwind of
   orographic rain producing watersheds that are impounded by large dams.}},

Abstract = {{Although the gel point conversion of a thermoreversible polymer network
   is certainly a key parameter in determining the material properties, it
   is not a conventional liquid solid transition as in common, irreversible
   networks. Rather, the material's viscosity is time-dependent and finite
   at the gel point and beyond, as bond breakage works in concert with
   diffusion to relax stresses imposed on the forming transient network of
   the material. For example, in a model Diels-Alder network with
   functionality 3.8 and a stoichiometric ratio of 10:6 furan:maleimide
   used here, a crossover frequency (0.52, 0.32, and 0.12 rad/s) was
   measured below the temperature corresponding to gelation (3, 5, and 10
   degrees C below, respectively). In this work, we describe this complex
   process occurring in model thermoreversible networks with a simple
   relationship from the work of Semenov and Rubinstein on associative
   transient networks. This relationship provides a toolkit for the
   prediction of the important engineering and rheological properties of
   the material in the postgel regime, such as viscosity, plateau modulus,
   and relaxation time, based upon the straightforward estimation of two
   material-dependent parameters: the gel point conversion p(gel) and a
   proportionality constant C. We show key agreement between theory and
   experiment as the gel point conversion estimated from network dynamics
   matches the classical prediction of the gel point within 4\% conversion.
   We discuss the applicability criteria of the Semenov Rubinstein scaling
   relationship and compare it to time temperature superposition methods of
   describing transient network relaxation.}},

Abstract = {{Controlled molecule release from scaffolds can dramatically increase the
   scaffold ability of directing tissue regeneration in vitro and in vivo.
   Crucial to the regeneration is precise regulation over release direction
   and kinetics of multiple molecules (small genes, peptides, or larger
   proteins). To this end, we developed gradient micropatterns of
   electrospun nanofibers along the scaffold thickness through programming
   the deposition of heterogeneous nanofibers of poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PCL) and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA). Confocal images of
   the scaffolds containing fluorophore-impregnated nanofibers demonstrated
   close matching of actual and designed gradient fiber patterns; thermal
   analyses further showed their matching in the composition. Using
   acid-terminated PLGA (PLGAac) and ester-terminated PLGA (PLGAes) to
   impregnate molecules in the PCL-PLGA scaffolds, we demonstrated for the
   first time their differences in nanofiber degeneration and molecular
   weight change during degradation. PLGAac nanofibers were more stable
   with gradual and steady increase in the fiber diameter during
   degradation, resulting in more spatially confined molecule delivery from
   PCL-PLGA scaffolds. Thus, patterns of PCL-PLGAac nanofibers were used to
   design versatile controlled delivery scaffolds. To test the hypothesis
   that molecule-impregnated PLGAac in the gradient-patterned PCL-PLGAac
   scaffolds can program various modalities of molecule release, model
   molecules, including small fluorophores and larger proteins, were
   respectively used for time-lapse release studies. Gradient-patterns were
   used as building blocks in the scaffolds to program simultaneous release
   of one or multiple proteins to one side or, respectively, to the
   opposite sides of scaffolds for up to 50 days. Results showed that the
   separation efficiency of molecule delivery from all the scaffolds with a
   thickness of 200 pm achieved >88\% for proteins and >82\% for small
   molecules. In addition to versatile spatially controlled delivery,
   micropatterns were designed to program sequential release of proteins.
   The hierarchically structured materials presented here may enable
   development of novel multifunctional scaffolds with defined 3D dynamic
   microenvironments for tissue regeneration.}},

Title = {{Length-dependent thermal conductivity of single extended polymer chains}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{The low thermal conductivity of polymers will be one of the major
   roadblocks for the polymer-based microelectronics and macroelectronics
   due to the limited heat spreading capability. Despite that the thermal
   conductivity of bulk polymers is usually low, a single extended polymer
   chain could have very high thermal conductivity. In this paper we
   present atomistic simulation studies on the phonon transport in single
   extended polymer chains of various polymers as a function of polymer
   chain length. The thermal conductivity of single extended polymer chains
   can be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than their bulk counterparts. The
   thermal conductivity of single extended polymer chains is a strong
   function of monomer type. For example, the thermal conductivity of the
   extended polymer chains with aromatic backbone can be up to 5 times as
   that of a polyethylene chain, while the thermal conductivity of the
   extended polymer chains with bond-strength or mass disorder can be only
   1/25 as that of a polyethylene chain. We analyze the phonon transport
   mechanisms in single extended polymer chains of various polymers and
   find that the competition between ballistic phonon transport and
   diffusive phonon transport in a polymer chain leads to a diverging
   length-dependent thermal conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{A novel application of electrowetting devices has been simulated:
   wavefront correction using an array of electrowetting lenses and prisms.
   Five waves of distortion can be corrected with Strehl ratios of 0.9 or
   higher, utilizing piston, tip-tilt, and curvature corrections from
   arrays of 19 elements and fill factors as low as 40\%. Effective control
   of piston can be achieved by placing the liquid lens array at the focus
   of two microlens arrays. Seven waves of piston delay can be generated
   with variation in focal length between 1.5 and 500 mm. (C) 2012 Optical

Abstract = {{The second Fourier component v(2) of the azimuthal anisotropy with
   respect to the reaction plane is measured for direct photons at
   midrapidity and transverse momentum (p(T)) of 1-12 GeV/c in Au + Au
   collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV. Previous measurements of this
   quantity for hadrons with p(T) < 6 GeV/c indicate that the medium
   behaves like a nearly perfect fluid, while for p(T) > 6 GeV/c a reduced
   anisotropy is interpreted in terms of a path-length dependence for
   parton energy loss. In this measurement with the PHENIX detector at the
   Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider we find that for p(T) > 4 GeV/c the
   anisotropy for direct photons is consistent with zero, which is as
   expected if the dominant source of direct photons is initial hard
   scattering. However, in the p(T) < 4 GeV/c region dominated by thermal
   photons, we find a substantial direct-photon v(2) comparable to that of
   hadrons, whereas model calculations for thermal photons in this
   kinematic region underpredict the observed v(2).}},

Title = {{Copper(II) Binding by Dissolved Organic Matter: Importance of the
   Copper-to-Dissolved Organic Matter Ratio and Implications for the Biotic
   Ligand Model}},

Abstract = {{The ratio of copper to dissolved organic matter (DOM) is known to affect
   the strength of copper binding by DOM, but previous methods to determine
   the Cu2+-DOM binding strength have generally not measured binding
   constants over the same Cu:DOM ratios. In this study, we used a
   competitive ligand exchange-solid-phase extraction (CLE-SPE) method to
   determine conditional stability constants for Cu2+-DOM binding at pH 6.6
   and 0.01 M ionic strength over a range of Cu:DOM ratios that bridge the
   detection windows of copper-ion-selective electrode and voltarmmetry
   measurements. As the Cu:DOM ratio increased from 0.0005 to 0.1 mg of
   Cu/mg of DOM, the measured conditional binding constant (K-c(CuDOM))
   decreased from 10(11.5) to 10(5.6) M-1. A comparison of the binding
   constants measured by CLE-SPE with those measured by
   copper-ion-selective electrode and voltammetry demonstrates that the
   Cu:DOM ratio is an important factor controlling Cu2+-DOM binding
   strength even for DOM isolates of different types and different sources
   and for whole water samples. The results were modeled with Visual
   MINTEQand compared to results from the biotic ligand model (BLM). The
   BLM was found to over-estimate Cu2+ at low total copper concentrations
   and under-estimate Cu2+ at high total copper concentrations.}},

   integrated luminosities of up to 5.1 fb(-1) at 7 TeV and 5.3 fb(-1) at 8
   TeV. The search is performed in five decay modes: gamma gamma, ZZ, W+W-,
   tau(+)tau(-), and b (b) over bar. An excess of events is observed above
   the expected background, with a local significance of 5.0 standard
   deviations, at a mass near 125 GeV, signalling the production of a new
   particle. The expected significance for a standard model Higgs boson of
   that mass is 5.8 standard deviations. The excess is most significant in
   the two decay modes with the best mass resolution, gamma gamma and ZZ; a
   fit to these signals gives a mass of 125.3 +/- 0.4(stat.) +/- 0.5(syst.)
   GeV. The decay to two photons indicates that the new particle is a boson
   with spin different from one. (C) 2012 CERN. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Snow is a critical storage component in the hydrologic cycle, but
   current measurement networks are sparse. In addition, the heterogeneity
   of snow requires surveying larger areas to measure the areal average. We
   presented snow measurements using GPS interferometric reflectometry
   (GPS-IR). GPS-IR measures a large area ( 100 m2), and existing GPS
   installations around the world have the potential to expand existing
   snow measurement networks. GPS-IR uses a standard, geodetic GPS
   installation to measure the snow surface via the reflected component of
   the signal. We reported GPS-IR snow depth measurements made at Niwot
   Ridge, Colorado, from October 2009 through June 2010. This site is in a
   topographic saddle at 3500 m elevation with a peak snow depth of 1.7 m
   near the GPS antenna. GPS-IR measurements are compared with biweekly
   snow surveys, a continuously operating scanning laser system and an
   airborne light detection and ranging (LIDAR) measurement. The GPS-IR
   measurement of peak snowpack (1.361.76 m) matches manual measurements
   (0.951.7 m) and the scanning laser (1.16 m). GPS-IR has RMS error of 13
   cm (bias = 10 cm) compared with the laser, although differences between
   the measurement locations make comparison imprecise. Over the melt
   season, when the snowpack is more homogenous, the difference between the
   GPS-IR and the laser is reduced (RMS = 9 cm, bias = 6 cm). In other
   locations, the GPS and the LIDAR agree on which areas have more or less
   snow, but the GPS estimates more snow on the ground on tracks to the
   west (1.58 m) than the LIDAR (1.14 m). Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The record-low thermospheric density during the last solar minimum has
   been reported and it has been mainly explained as the consequence of the
   anomalously low solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) irradiance. In this
   study, we examined the variation of the energy budget to the Earth's
   upper atmosphere during last solar cycle from both solar EUV irradiance
   and geomagnetic energy, including Joule heating and particle
   precipitation. The globally integrated solar EUV power was calculated
   from the EUV flux model for aeronomic calculations (EUVAC) driven by the
   MgII index. The annal average of solar power in 2008 was 33 GW lower
   than that in 1996. The decrease of the globally integrated geomagnetic
   energy from 1996 to 2008 was close to 29 GW including 13 GW for Joule
   heating from Weimer (2005b) and 16 GW for particle precipitation from
   NOAA Polar-Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) measurements.
   Although the estimate of the solar EUV power and geomagnetic energy vary
   from model to model, the reduction of the geomagnetic energy was
   comparable to the solar EUV power. The Thermosphere Ionosphere
   Electrodynamic General Circulation Model (TIEGCM) simulations indicate
   that the solar irradiance and geomagnetic energy variations account for
   3/4 and 1/4 of the total neutral density decrease in 2008, respectively.}},

Title = {{Averting biodiversity collapse in tropical forest protected areas}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{489}},
Number = {{7415}},
Pages = {{290-294}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{The rapid disruption of tropical forests probably imperils global
   biodiversity more than any other contemporary phenomenon(1-3). With
   deforestation advancing quickly, protected areas are increasingly
   becoming final refuges for threatened species and natural ecosystem
   processes. However, many protected areas in the tropics are themselves
   vulnerable to human encroachment and other environmental stresses(4-9).
   As pressures mount, it is vital to know whether existing reserves can
   sustain their biodiversity. A critical constraint in addressing this
   question has been that data describing a broad array of biodiversity
   groups have been unavailable for a sufficiently large and representative
   sample of reserves. Here we present a uniquely comprehensive data set on
   changes over the past 20 to 30 years in 31 functional groups of species
   and 21 potential drivers of environmental change, for 60 protected areas
   stratified across the world's major tropical regions. Our analysis
   reveals great variation in reserve `health': about half of all reserves
   have been effective or performed passably, but the rest are experiencing
   an erosion of biodiversity that is often alarmingly widespread
   taxonomically and functionally. Habitat disruption, hunting and
   forest-product exploitation were the strongest predictors of declining
   reserve health. Crucially, environmental changes immediately outside
   reserves seemed nearly as important as those inside in determining their
   ecological fate, with changes inside reserves strongly mirroring those
   occurring around them. These findings suggest that tropical protected
   areas are often intimately linked ecologically to their surrounding
   habitats, and that a failure to stem broad-scale loss and degradation of
   such habitats could sharply increase the likelihood of serious
   biodiversity declines.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass burning (BB) contributes large amounts of black carbon (BC) and
   particulate organic matter (POM) to the atmosphere and contributes
   significantly to the earth's radiation balance. BB particles can be a
   complicated optical system, with scattering and absorption contributions
   from BC, internal mixtures of BC and POM, and wavelength-dependent
   absorption of POM. Large amounts of POM can also be externally mixed. We
   report on the unique ability of multi-wavelength photo-acoustic
   measurements of dry and thermal-denuded absorption to deconstruct this
   complicated wavelength-dependent system of absorption and mixing.
   Optical measurements of BB particles from the Four Mile Canyon fire near
   Boulder, Colorado, showed that internal mixtures of BC and POM enhanced
   absorption by up to 70\%. The data supports the assumption that the POM
   was very weakly absorbing at 532 nm. Enhanced absorption at 404 nm was
   in excess of 200\% above BC absorption and varied as POM mass changed,
   indicative of absorbing POM. Absorption by internal mixing of BC and POM
   contributed 19(+/- 8)\% to total 404-nm absorption, while BC alone
   contributed 54(+/- 16)\%. Approximately 83\% of POM mass was externally
   mixed, the absorption of which contributed 27(+/- 15)\% to total
   particle absorption (at 404 nm). The imaginary refractive index and mass
   absorption efficiency (MAE) of POM at 404 nm changed throughout the
   sampling period and were found to be 0.007 +/- 0.005 and 0.82 +/- 0.43
   m(2) g(-1), respectively. Our analysis shows that the MAE of POM can be
   biased high by up to 50\% if absorption from internal mixing of POM and
   BC is not included.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous and ultrathin platinum (Pt) films were deposited on tungsten
   (W) adhesion layers using atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques. Pt
   ALD films were deposited at 120 C using MeCpPtMe3 and H-2 plasma as the
   reactants. X-ray reflectivity studies observed the rapid nucleation of
   the Pt film. X-ray photoelectron results were consistent with
   layer-by-layer growth suggesting a continuous Pt film at thicknesses >=
   1.5 nm. The high surface energy of the W ALD adhesion layer enables the
   growth of continuous and ultrathin films of lower surface energy metals
   and should facilitate the use of precious metals for a variety of
   applications. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{We studied heat production in Pd-impregnated alumina powder in the
   presence of hydrogen and deuterium gases, investigating claims of
   anomalous heat generated as a result of nuclear fusion, usually referred
   to as a low energy nuclear reaction (LENR). By selecting the water
   isotope used to fabricate the material and then varying the gas used for
   loading, we were able to influence the amount of heat released or
   consumed. We suggest that Pd in its nanoparticle form catalyzes
   hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange reactions in the material. This
   hypothesis is supported by heat measurements, residual gas analysis
   (RGA) data, and calculations of energy available from H/D exchange
   reactions. Based on the results we conclude that the origin of the
   anomalous heat generated during deuterium loading of Pd-enriched alumina
   powder is chemical rather than nuclear. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{As part of an effort to systematically improve our junior-level E\&M I
   course, we have developed a tool to assess student conceptual learning
   of electrostatics at the upper division. Together with a group of
   physics faculty, we established a list of learning goals for the course
   that, with results from student observations and interviews, served as a
   guide in creating the Colorado Upper-Division Electrostatics (CUE)
   assessment. The result is a 17-question open-ended post-test diagnostic
   (with an optional 7-question pretest) and an accompanying grading
   rubric. We present measures of the validation and reliability of the
   instrument and grading rubric, plus results from 535 students in both
   standard and interactive-engagement courses across seven institutions as
   a baseline for the instrument. Overall, we find that the CUE is a valid
   and reliable measure, and the data herein are intended to be of use to
   researchers and faculty interested in using the CUE to measure student
   learning.}},

   investigation using airborne measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Aircraft measurements during the 2006 Gulf of Mexico Atmospheric
   Composition and Climate Study (GoMACCS) are used to examine the
   influence of shallow cumulus clouds on vertical profiles of aerosol
   chemical composition, size distributions, and secondary aerosol
   precursor gases. The data show signatures of convective transport of
   particles, gases and moisture from near the surface to higher altitudes,
   and of aqueous-phase production of aerosol mass (sulfate and organics)
   in cloud droplets and aerosol water. In cloudy conditions, the average
   aerosol volume concentration at an altitude of 2850 m, above typical
   cloud top levels, was found to be 34\% of that at 450 m; for clear
   conditions, the same ratio was 13\%. Both organic and sulfate mass
   fractions were on average constant with altitude (around 50\%); however,
   the ratio of oxalate to organic mass increased with altitude (from 1\%
   at 450 m to almost 9\% at 3450 m), indicative of the influence of
   in-cloud production on the vertical abundance and characteristics of
   secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass. A new metric termed ``residual
   cloud fraction{''} is introduced as a way of quantifying the ``cloud
   processing history{''} of an air parcel. Results of a parcel model
   simulating aqueous phase production of sulfate and organics reproduce
   observed trends and point at a potentially important role of SOA
   production, especially oligomers, in deliquesced aerosols. The
   observations emphasize the importance of shallow cumulus clouds in
   altering the vertical distribution of aerosol properties that influence
   both their direct and indirect effect on climate.}},

Abstract = {{The long-term removal of 34 trace organic micropollutants (<1 mu g L-1)
   was evaluated and modeled in drinking water biological filters with sand
   media from a full-scale plant. The micropollutants included pesticides,
   pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, some of which are endocrine
   disrupting chemicals, and represent a wide range of uses, chemical
   structures, adsorbabilities, and biodegradabilities. Micropollutant
   removal ranged from no measurable removal (<15\%) for 13 compounds to
   removal below the detection limit and followed one of four trends over
   the one year study period: steady state removal throughout, increasing
   removal to steady state (acclimation), decreasing removal, or no removal
   (recalcitrant). Removals for all 19 nonrecalcitrant compounds followed
   first-order kinetics when at steady state with increased removal at
   longer empty bed contact times (EBCT). Rate constants were calculated,
   0.02-0.37 min(-1), and used in a pseudo-first-order rate model with the
   EBCT to predict removals in laboratory biofilters at a different EBCT
   and influent conditions. Drinking water biofiltration has the potential
   to be an effective process for the control of many trace organic
   contaminants and a pseudo-first-order model can serve as an appropriate
   method for approximating performance.}},

Abstract = {{2-Methyl-3-buten-2-ol (MBO) is an important biogenic volatile organic
   compound (BVOC) emitted by pine trees and a potential precursor of
   atmospheric secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in forested regions. In the
   present study, hydroxyl radical (OH)-initiated oxidation of MBO was
   examined in smog chambers under varied initial nitric oxide (NO) and
   aerosol acidity levels. Results indicate measurable SOA from MBO under
   low-NO conditions. Moreover, increasing aerosol acidity was found to
   enhance MBO SOA. Chemical characterization of laboratory-generated MBO
   SOA reveals that an organosulfate species (C5H12O6S, MW 200) formed and
   was substantially enhanced with elevated aerosol acidity. Ambient fine
   aerosol (PM2.5) samples collected from the BEARPEX campaign during 2007
   and 2009, as well as from the BEACHON-RoMBAS campaign during 2011, were
   also analyzed. The MBO-derived organosulfate characterized from
   laboratory-generated aerosol was observed in PM2.5 collected from these
   campaigns, demonstrating that it is continued..}},

Abstract = {{Global aerosol direct radiative forcing (DRF) is an important metric for
   assessing potential climate impacts of future emissions changes.
   However, the radiative consequences of emissions perturbations are not
   readily quantified nor well understood at the level of detail necessary
   to assess realistic policy options. To address this challenge, here we
   show how adjoint model sensitivities can be used to provide highly
   spatially resolved estimates of the DRF from emissions of black carbon
   (BC), primary organic carbon (OC), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ammonia
   (NH3), using the example of emissions from each sector and country
   following multiple Representative Concentration Pathway (RCPs). The
   radiative forcing efficiencies of many individual emissions are found to
   differ considerably from regional or sectoral averages for NH3, SO2 from
   the power sector, and BC from domestic, industrial, transportation and
   biomass burning sources. Consequently, the amount of emissions controls
   required to attain a specific DRF varies at intracontinental scales by
   up to a factor of 4. These results thus demonstrate both a need and
   means for incorporating spatially refined aerosol DRF into analysis of
   future emissions scenario and design of air quality and climate change
   mitigation policies.}},

Abstract = {{Though new water supply source development has always required planning
   under many forms of uncertainty, climate change presents an added
   dimension that may exacerbate supply and water quality challenges.
   Hence, new decision-support tools are needed, and in this paper an
   approach that incorporates the uncertainty of climate variability and
   change into a cost assessment framework for a municipal drinking water
   provider in Colorado is developed and applied. The water utility
   provider is developing a new source of water supply, but treatment costs
   are relatively high because of the advanced processes needed to treat
   the water to desired standards. Furthermore, the new water source has
   variable salinity concentrations that are not removed by any of the
   implemented treatment processes, requiring blending with an existing
   lower salinity water source. This results in an increase in the finished
   water salinity (as compared with the existing water source), which can
   have negative impacts on customer satisfaction and the life span of
   water-using appliances. To plan for the development of this water supply
   source, an approach is proposed to assess the potential treatment and
   residential costs associated with the blending of the new water source
   with an existing source under climate uncertainty. Uncertainty from
   climate variability is captured through a previously developed
   stochastic streamflow and water quality simulation method that utilizes
   climate change scenarios. Results show that the proposed blend
   strategies incur increased treatment costs and economic impacts for
   customers. Specifically, a 30\% reduction in annual flows from climate
   change translates into a 12\% treatment cost increase and a 22\% rise in
   residential costs. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)WR.1943-5452.0000150. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The request for proposal (RFP) with the design-build (DB) procurement
   arrangement is a document in which an owner develops his requirements
   and conveys the project scope to DB contractors. Owners should provide
   an appropriate level of design in DB RFPs to adequately describe their
   requirements without compromising the prospects for innovation. This
   paper examines and compares the different levels of owner-provided
   design in DB RFPs by the content analysis of 84 requests for RFPs for
   public DB projects advertised between 2000 and 2010 with an aggregate
   contract value of over \$5.4 billion. A statistical analysis was also
   conducted to explore the relationship between the proportion of
   owner-provided design and other project information, including project
   type, advertisement time, project size, contractor selection method,
   procurement process, and contract type. The results show that the
   majority (64.8\%) of the RFPs provides less than 10\% of the
   owner-provided design. The owner-provided design proportion has a
   significant association with project type, project size, contractor
   selection method, and contract type. In addition, owners are generally
   providing less design in recent years than previously. The research
   findings also provide owners with perspectives to determine the
   appropriate level of owner-provided design in DB RFPs. DOI:

Abstract = {{In this study, an experimental platform is developed to quantitatively
   measure the performance of robotic wheel treads in a dynamic
   environment. The platform imposes a dynamic driving condition for a
   single robot wheel, where the wheel is rotated on a translating
   substrate, thereby inducing slip. The normal force of the wheel can be
   adjusted mechanically, while the rotational velocity of the wheel and
   the translational velocity of the substrate can be controlled using an
   open-loop control system. Wheel slip and translational speed can be
   varied autonomously while wheel traction force is measured using a load
   cell. The testing platform is characterized by testing one
   micropatterned polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) tread on three substrates
   (dry synthetic tissue, hydrated synthetic tissue, and excised porcine
   small bowel tissue), at three normal forces (0.10, 0.20, and 0.30 N), 13
   slip ratios (-0.30 to 0.30 in increments of 0.05), and three
   translational speeds (2, 3, and 6 mm/s). Additionally, two wheels
   (micropatterned and smooth PDMS) are tested on beef liver at the same
   three normal forces and translational speeds for a tread comparison. An
   analysis of variance revealed that the platform can detect statistically
   significant differences between means when observing normal forces,
   translational speeds, slip ratios, treads, and substrates. The variance
   due to within (platform error, P = 1) and between trials (human error, P
   = 0.152) is minimal when compared to the normal force (P = 0.036),
   translational speed (P = 0.059), slip ratio (P = 0), tread (P = 0.004),
   and substrate variances (P = 0). In conclusion, this precision testing
   platform can be used to determine wheel tread performance differences on
   the three substrates and for each of the studied parameters. Future use
   of the platform could lead to an optimized micropattern-based mobility
   system, under given operating conditions, for implementation on a
   robotic capsule endoscope.}},

Title = {{Adjoint Simulation of Stream Depletion Due to Aquifer Pumping}},
Journal = {{GROUND WATER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{746-753}},
Month = {{SEP-OCT}},
Abstract = {{If an aquifer is hydraulically connected to an adjacent stream, a
   pumping well operating in the aquifer will draw some water from aquifer
   storage and some water from the stream, causing stream depletion.
   Several analytical, semi-analytical, and numerical approaches have been
   developed to estimate stream depletion due to pumping. These approaches
   are effective if the well location is known. If a new well is to be
   installed, it may be desirable to install the well at a location where
   stream depletion is minimal. If several possible locations are
   considered for the location of a new well, stream depletion would have
   to be estimated for all possible well locations, which can be
   computationally inefficient. The adjoint approach for estimating stream
   depletion is a more efficient alternative because with one simulation of
   the adjoint model, stream depletion can be estimated for pumping at a
   well at any location. We derive the adjoint equations for a coupled
   system with a confined aquifer, an overlying unconfined aquifer, and a
   river that is hydraulically connected to the unconfined aquifer. We
   assume that the stage in the river is known, and is independent of the
   stream depletion, consistent with the assumptions of the MODFLOW river
   package. We describe how the adjoint equations can be solved using
   MODFLOW. In an illustrative example, we show that for this scenario, the
   adjoint approach is as accurate as standard forward numerical simulation
   methods, and requires substantially less computational effort.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores how a scaled aircraft can be used to model a
   full-scale aircraft sonic boom. All scales from 5 to 100\% are
   investigated. To create a scaled pressure profile that represents the
   full-size aircraft, the Mach number, static margin, angle of attack, and
   canard incidence angle are set equal to the full-size aircraft's
   parameters. By setting these parameters, the scaled unmanned aircraft
   creates an F-function proportional to the square of the scaling ratio.
   To scale the acoustic advance, the propagation distance must be reduced.
   One way to accomplish this scaling is to fly at a lower altitude;
   however, to generate the proper wing loading, a pull-up maneuver must be
   performed. Alternatively, the subscale vehicle can be flown at the
   full-scale aircraft cruise altitude, and data are recorded at an
   intermediate altitude by a chase aircraft with a pressure probe. Using
   this method, the test aircraft properly models the shape of the
   full-scale aircraft sonic boom. The duration and overpressure of its
   sonic boom are respectively linearly and quadratically proportional to
   its scale. The lower bound in size is explored by considering
   manufacturing, data acquisition, and molecular relaxation.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ACOUSTICS}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{We extend the Huygens wavefront tracing algorithm, which is a part of an
   open source Madagascar project, to sound propagation in inhomogeneous,
   moving media and apply it to a series of benchmark tasks. One set of
   tasks admits exact analytic solutions and serves the purpose of
   validation of the new algorithm. Another set of calculations
   demonstrates applicability of the algorithm to the studies of wavefront
   dynamics and stability in ocean and atmospheric acoustics. The method is
   based on a system of differential equations equivalent to the eikonal
   equation, but formulated in the ray coordinate system. In this paper, we
   present a first-order, two-dimensional discretization scheme that is
   interpreted very simply in terms of the Huygens' principle. The method
   has proved to be a convenient alternative to conventional ray tracing.}},

Abstract = {{Electron emission from single, supported Ag nanocubes excited with

   emission is found to peak for laser polarization aligned with cube
   diagonals, suggesting the critical influence of plasmonic near-field
   enhancement of the incident electric field on the overall electron
   yield. For laser pulses with photon energy below the metal work
   function, coherent multiphoton photoelectron emission (MPPE) is
   identified as the most probable mechanism responsible for electron
   emission from Ag nanocubes and likely metal nanoparticles/surfaces in

Abstract = {{The Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) investigation of the Mars Science
   Laboratory (MSL) addresses the chemical and isotopic composition of the
   atmosphere and volatiles extracted from solid samples. The SAM
   investigation is designed to contribute substantially to the mission
   goal of quantitatively assessing the habitability of Mars as an
   essential step in the search for past or present life on Mars. SAM is a
   40 kg instrument suite located in the interior of MSL's Curiosity rover.
   The SAM instruments are a quadrupole mass spectrometer, a tunable laser
   spectrometer, and a 6-column gas chromatograph all coupled through solid
   and gas processing systems to provide complementary information on the
   same samples. The SAM suite is able to measure a suite of light isotopes
   and to analyze volatiles directly from the atmosphere or thermally
   released from solid samples. In addition to measurements of simple
   inorganic compounds and noble gases SAM will conduct a sensitive search
   for organic compounds with either thermal or chemical extraction from
   sieved samples delivered by the sample processing system on the
   Curiosity rover's robotic arm.}},

Abstract = {{For central India and its west coast, rainfall in the early (15 May-20
   June) and late (15 September-20 October) monsoon season correlates with
   Pacific Ocean sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the preceding
   month (April and August, respectively) sufficiently well, that those SST
   anomalies can be used to predict such rainfall. The patterns of SST
   anomalies that correlate best include the equatorial region near the
   dateline, and for the early monsoon season (especially since similar to
   1980), a band of opposite correlation stretching from near the equator
   at 120A degrees E to similar to 25A degrees N at the dateline. Such
   correlations for both early and late monsoon rainfall and for both
   regions approach, if not exceed, 0.5. Although correlations between All
   India Summer Monsoon Rainfall and typical indices for the El
   Nio-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) commonly are stronger for the period
   before than since 1980, these correlations with early and late monsoon
   seasons suggest that ENSO continues to affect the monsoon in these
   seasons. We exploit these patterns to assess predictability, and we find
   that SSTs averages in specified regions of the Pacific Ocean in April
   (August) offer predictors that can forecast rainfall amounts in the
   early (late) monsoon season period with a similar to 25\% improvement in
   skill relative to climatology. The same predictors offer somewhat less
   skill (similar to 20\% better than climatology) for predicting the
   number of days in these periods with rainfall greater than 2.5 mm. These
   results demonstrate that although the correlation of ENSO indices with
   All India Rainfall has decreased during the past few decades, the
   connections with ENSO in the early and late parts have not declined;
   that for the early monsoon season, in fact, has grown stronger in recent
   decades.}},

Abstract = {{The southeastern United States is an economically important agricultural
   region, yet its role in the regional C budget is not fully understood.
   There is concern that climate change, particularly altered precipitation
   patterns, may induce a shift in how crops exchange CO2 with the
   atmosphere. This study examined the seasonal and interannual variation
   in net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of a winter wheat cover crop (Triticum
   aestivum L.) and soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.] using the eddy
   covariance (EC) method. This was conducted at Winfred Thomas
   Agricultural Research Station, Hazel Green, AL (2007-2009). Annual C
   balance ranged from a source in 2007 (NEE = 100 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) to a
   sink (-20 g C m(-2) yr(-1)) in 2009. Annual ecosystem respiration (Re)
   ranged between 750 and 1013 g C m(-2) yr(-1), while gross ecosystem
   productivity was between 650 and 1034 g C m(-2) yr(-1). Seasonal NEE for
   soybean ranged between 42 and -66 g C m(-2). The uptake rates from the
   cover crop (NEE = -80.0, -80.4, and -40.0 g C m(-2) for 2007, 2008, and
   2009, respectively) suggested the importance of winter C uptake off
   setting C losses caused by summer droughts. The R-e varied between 286
   and 542 g C m(-2) for soybean and between 160 and 313 g C m(-2) for the
   cover crop. Annual variations in NEE and R-e were primarily due to
   precipitation and air temperature, respectively, indicating a tight
   coupling between biophysical factors and C uptake. Our results were
   compared with those from other reported NEE crop estimates using EC.}},

Abstract = {{The two-dimensional crystalline structures in graphene challenge the
   applicability of existing theories that have been used for
   characterizing its three-dimensional counterparts. It is crucial to
   establish reliable structure-property relationships in the important
   two-dimensional crystals to fully use their remarkable properties. With
   the success in synthesizing large-area polycrystalline graphene(1-5),
   understanding how grain boundaries (GBs) in graphene(2-4) alter its
   physical properties(5-13) is of both scientific and technological
   importance. A recent work showed that more GB defects could counter
   intuitively give rise to higher strength in tilt GBs (ref. 10). We show
   here that GB strength can either increase or decrease with the tilt, and
   the behaviour can be explained well by continuum mechanics. It is not
   just the density of defects that affects the mechanical properties, but
   the detailed arrangements of defects are also important. The strengths
   of tilt GBs increase as the square of the tilt angles if
   pentagon-heptagon defects are evenly spaced, and the trend breaks down
   in other cases. We find that mechanical failure always starts from the
   bond shared by hexagon-heptagon rings. Our present work provides
   fundamental guidance towards understanding how defects interact in
   two-dimensional crystals, which is important for using high-strength and
   stretchable graphene(14) for biological and electronic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Although the current economic downturn has eased the stress of broad
   skilled labour shortages, it is reasonable to believe that the shortage
   will return when the U. S. economy rebounds. The shortage could become
   more substantial because the U. S. construction industry is poised to
   make a significant demographic shift with Baby Boomer workers
   approaching retirement and Generation Y workers joining the workforce.
   This paper investigates how different generations of craft workers
   perceive the factors affecting labour productivity. The data was
   collected through a survey of 1996 craft workers on 28 U. S.
   construction sites in 2004 and 2005. The analysis results reveal that:
   (1) Generation Y, Generation X, and Baby Boomers actually have consensus
   on the relative impact of productivity factors; and (2) significant
   differences were also observed on individual productivity factors and
   the primary differences among the generations were associated with tools
   and consumables, labour, engineering drawing management, and project
   policy.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in network coding have shown great potential for
   efficient information multicasting in communication networks, in terms
   of both network throughput and network management. In this paper, the
   problem of flow control at end-systems for network-coding-based
   multicast flows is addressed. Optimization-based models are formulated
   for network resource allocation, based on which two sets of
   decentralized controllers at sources and links/nodes for congestion
   control are developed for wired networks with given coding subgraphs and
   without given coding subgraphs, respectively. With random network
   coding, both sets of controllers can be implemented in a distributed
   manner, and work at the transport layer to adjust source rates and at
   network layer to carry out network coding. The convergence of the
   proposed controllers to the desired equilibrium operating points is
   proved, and numerical examples are provided to complement the
   theoretical analysis. The extension to wireless networks is also briefly
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A thiol-ene polymerization platform was used to synthesize peptide
   functionalized poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels, which were initially
   characterized and compared to theoretical predictions of Young's modulus
   via a theoretical crosslinking density equation presented herein. After
   thorough characterization, this material system's utility for answering
   specific biological hypotheses was demonstrated with the culture and
   observation of aortic valvular interstitial cells (VICs). Specifically,
   these materials were used to better understand the role of substrate
   elasticity and biochemical functionality on VIC alpha-smooth muscle
   (alpha SMA) expression and secretory properties (i.e. de novo
   extracellular matrix (ECM)). The Young's moduli of the hydrogels varied
   from 28 kPa (activating, 90\% myofibroblasts) to 4 kPa (non-activating,
   15\% myofibroblast), and the biochemical functionality was tailored by
   incorporating three small adhesive peptide sequences, RGDS, VGVAPG and
   P15. To promote VIC adhesion, a basal {[}RGDS] of 0.8 mM was used in all
   formulations, while the {[}VGVAPG] or {[}P15] were varied to be lower
   than, equal to or higher than 0.8 mM. The substrates with 1.2 mM VGVAPG
   and all gels with P15 led to significantly higher alpha SMA expression
   for both stiff and soft substrates, as compared to 0.8 mM RGDS alone.
   Importantly, all gel conditions alpha SMA expression were significantly
   lower than tissue culture poly(styrene) (TCPS; similar to 4- to 10-fold
   difference). The ECM produced decreased significantly as the total
   integrin-binding peptide concentration increased, but was significantly
   higher than that produced on TCPS. This easily tailored material system
   provides a useful culture platform to improve the fundamental
   understanding of VIC biology through isolating specific biological cues
   and observing VIC function. (C) 2012 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{This study investigates the relationship between genetic copy number
   variations and brain volume differences in an alcohol use disorder (AUD)
   population. We hypothesized that copy number variations may influence
   subject's risk for alcohol use disorders through variations in regional
   gray and white matter brain volumes. Since genetic influences upon
   behavior are the result of many complicated interactions we focus on
   differences in brain volume as a putative intermediate phenotype between
   genetic variation and behavior. Copy number variation, alcohol use
   assessments and brain structural magnetic resonance images from 283
   subjects, 199 male and 84 females who were enrolled in two AUD studies
   were obtained and analyzed using a combination of the Freesurfer image
   analysis suite and independent component analysis. Because brain volume
   varies by age we compared participant's volume variation with that
   derived from a control cohort of 75 subjects. In addition we also
   regressed out the possible brain volume changes induced by long term
   alcohol consumption. Small cerebral cortex, cerebellar and caudate along
   with large cerebral white matter and 5th ventricle volumes are shown to
   be significantly associated with increased AUD severity. When these
   volume variations are compared with control subject volumes; the
   variations seen in subjects with AUD are markedly different from normal
   aging effects. CNVs at 11 q14.2 are marginally (p < 0.05 uncorrected)
   correlated with such brain volume variations and the correlation holds
   true after controlling for long-term alcohol consumption; deletion
   carriers have smaller cerebral cortex, cerebellar, caudate and larger
   cerebral white matter and 5th ventricle volumes than insertion carriers
   or subjects with no variation in this region. Similarly, deletion
   carriers also demonstrate higher AUD severity scores than insertion
   carriers or subjects with no variation. The results presented here
   suggest that copy number variation and in particular the variation at
   chromosome 11 q14.2 may have an impact in brain volume variation,
   potentially influencing AUD behavior. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Using hyperbranched oligomer functionalized glass fillers to reduce
   shrinkage stress}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1004-1011}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Fillers are widely utilized to enhance the mechanical
   properties of polymer resins. However, polymerization stress has the
   potential to increase due to the higher elastic modulus achieved upon
   filler addition. Here, we demonstrate a hyperbranched oligomer
   functionalized glass filler UV curable resin composite which is able to
   reduce the shrinkage stress without sacrificing mechanical properties.
   Methods. A 16-functional alkene-terminated hyperbranched oligomer is
   synthesized by thiol-acrylate and thiol-yne reactions and the product
   structure is analyzed by H-1 NMR, mass spectroscopy, and gel permeation
   chromatography. Surface functionalization of the glass filler is
   measured by thermogravimetric analysis. Reaction kinetics, mechanical
   properties and shrinkage stress are studied via Fourier transform
   infrared spectroscopy, dynamic mechanical analysis and a tensometer,
   respectively.
   Results. Silica nanoparticles are functionalized with a flexible
   16-functional alkene-terminated hyperbranched oligomer which is
   synthesized by multistage thiol-ene/yne reactions. 93\% of the particle
   surface was covered by this oligomer and an interfacial layer ranging
   from 0.7 nm to 4.5 nm thickness is generated. A composite system with
   these functionalized silica nanoparticles incorporated into the
   thiol-yne-methacrylate resin demonstrates 30\% reduction of shrinkage
   stress (from 0.9 MPa to 0.6 MPa) without sacrificing the modulus (3100
   +/- 300 MPa) or glass transition temperature (62 +/- 3 degrees C).
   Moreover, the shrinkage stress of the composite system builds up at much
   later stages of the polymerization as compared to the control system.
   Significance. Due to the capability of reducing shrinkage stress without
   sacrificing mechanical properties, this composite system will be a great
   candidate for dental composite applications. (C) 2012 Academy of Dental

Abstract = {{A novel and facile method was successfully developed to fabricate
   wafer-scale Si nanowire arrays with well-controlled sizes through the
   in-situ porous anodic alumina (PAA) template-assisted wet-etching
   process. The diameter and filling ratio (inter-wire spacing) of the
   as-prepared Si nanowires are determined by the size and density of pores
   in the in-situ PAA templates, which can be tailored independently by
   adjusting the anodization voltages and the immersion time of PAA
   templates in phosphoric acid. The length of Si nanowires can be more
   than one hundred micrometers long, which is controlled by adjusting the
   wet-etching time. Moreover, this method is compatible with complex Si
   surface topology for creating desirable 3-dimensional hybrid
   micro/nano-structures. Such Si nanowire arrays exhibit ultralow
   reflectance and interesting wettability that are of great importance to
   photovoltaics and thermal management applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The study of 3 mol\% yttria stabilized zirconia (3YSZ) with different
   particle sizes provides new insights into flash sintering. Four powders,
   all with the same crystallite size but various particle size were
   investigated: described as nominally 1 mu m (D80=0.51 mu m, meaning 80
   vol\% has a size less than 0.51 mu m), 2 mu m (D80=0.90 mu m), 5 mu m
   (D80=2.11 mu m) and 10 mu m (D80=3.09 mu m). While the furnace
   temperature for flash sintering, at a field of 100 V cm(-1), increased
   from 920 degrees C to 1040 degrees C with particle size, the specimen
   temperature in all instances remained at similar to 1200 degrees C. The
   quantum increase in density decreased with larger particles. The grain
   size distribution of conventionally and flash sintered specimens
   remained similar, with some evidence of a preponderance of nanograins in
   the flash sintered specimens. Joule heating was well below the
   temperatures that would have been required for sintering in a few
   seconds. An explanation based upon the nucleation of Frenkel pairs is

Abstract = {{We systematically compare the morphological evolution of thin PS/PMMA
   films, with varying compositions, during thermal annealing on
   preferential and non-preferential surfaces. On native silicon oxide
   surfaces, the phase evolution in the films was dictated by the
   preferential substrate-wetting of PMMA. However, the resulting PS relief
   structures on the PMMA wetting layer varied with the blend composition,
   and transitioned from capillary-fluctuation-mediated breakup to random
   nucleation with increased PS concentration. In contrast, the
   morphological evolution of the PS/PMMA films on non-preferential
   surfaces was also dictated by the coarsening of PMMA domain, but
   proceeded without the formation of a PMMA wetting layer. Both the PS and
   PMMA domains maintain direct contact with both the substrate and free
   surfaces throughout the evolution of the morphology. The morphologies at
   the interfaces were highly correlated, but with distinctive length
   scales. A variety of dispersed and continuous phase-separated structures
   can thus be obtained. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric black carbon (BC) warms Earth's climate, and its reduction
   has been targeted for near-term climate change mitigation. Models that
   include forcing by BC assume internal mixing with non-BC aerosol
   components that enhance BC absorption, often by a factor of similar to
   2; such model estimates have yet to be clearly validated through
   atmospheric observations. Here, direct in situ measurements of BC
   absorption enhancements (E-abs) and mixing state are reported for two
   California regions. The observed E-abs is small-6\% on average at 532
   nm-and increases weakly with photochemical aging. The E-abs is less than
   predicted from observationally constrained theoretical calculations,
   suggesting that many climate models may overestimate warming by BC.
   These ambient observations stand in contrast to laboratory measurements
   that show substantial E-abs for BC are possible.}},

   time lattice Boltzmann method}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{104-114}},

Abstract = {{We present a topology optimization method to systematically design the
   layout and shape of flow channels in micro-mixers for miscible fluids
   under steady-state conditions. The multi component flow is predicted by
   a multi-relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method (MRT-LBM) which allows
   independent control of Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. The MRT-LBM is
   verified against results of a passive scalar finite element
   advection-diffusion model. The geometry of the flow channels is
   described by a material distribution approach by varying the porosity of
   a fictitious material. While this material model penalizes fluid
   velocity it does not prevent diffusion through porous material. We show
   that for Peclet numbers greater than 1 the diffusion of fluids through
   porous material does not significantly affect mixing predictions. The
   material distribution is optimized by a gradient-based optimization
   scheme using adjoint sensitivities to compute the derivatives of the
   objective and constraints. For a two-dimensional model problem, we
   compare optimization results for various formulations of the design
   problem. The numerical results illustrate the suitability of the
   proposed method to optimize micro-mixers and show interesting
   interdependencies between the porosity model and the formulation of the
   objective function. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Over the last century humans have altered the export of fluvial
   materials leading to significant changes in morphology, chemistry, and
   biology of the coastal ocean. Here we present sedimentary,
   paleoenvironmental and paleogenetic evidence to show that the Black Sea,
   a nearly enclosed marine basin, was affected by land use long before the
   changes of the Industrial Era. Although watershed hydroclimate was
   spatially and temporally variable over the last similar to 3000 years,
   surface salinity dropped systematically in the Black Sea. Sediment loads
   delivered by Danube River, the main tributary of the Black Sea,
   significantly increased as land use intensified in the last two
   millennia, which led to a rapid expansion of its delta. Lastly,
   proliferation of diatoms and dinoflagellates over the last five to six
   centuries, when intensive deforestation occurred in Eastern Europe,
   points to an anthropogenic pulse of river-borne nutrients that radically
   transformed the food web structure in the Black Sea.}},

Abstract = {{Light-matter interactions are ubiquitous, and underpin a wide range of
   basic research fields and applied technologies. Although optical
   interactions have been intensively studied, their microscopic details
   are often poorly understood and have so far not been directly
   measurable. X-ray and optical wave mixing was proposed nearly half a
   century ago as an atomic-scale probe of optical interactions but has not
   yet been observed owing to a lack of sufficiently intense X-ray sources.
   Here we use an X-ray laser to demonstrate X-ray and optical
   sum-frequency generation. The underlying nonlinearity is a
   reciprocal-space probe of the optically induced charges and associated
   microscopic fields that arise in an illuminated material. To within the
   experimental errors, the measured efficiency is consistent with
   first-principles calculations of microscopic optical polarization in
   diamond. The ability to probe optical interactions on the atomic scale
   offers new opportunities in both basic and applied areas of science.}},

Title = {{Basal crevasses on the Larsen C Ice Shelf, Antarctica: Implications for
   meltwater ponding and hydrofracture}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{A key mechanism for the rapid collapse of both the Larsen A and B Ice
   Shelves was meltwater-driven crevasse propagation. Basal crevasses,
   large-scale structural features within ice shelves, may have contributed
   to this mechanism in three important ways: i) the shelf surface deforms
   due to modified buoyancy and gravitational forces above the basal
   crevasse, creating >10 m deep compressional surface depressions where
   meltwater can collect, ii) bending stresses from the modified shape
   drive surface crevassing, with crevasses reaching 40 m in width, on the
   flanks of the basal-crevasse-induced trough and iii) the ice thickness

Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{Over the course of four years, we have researched and transformed a key
   course in the career of an undergraduate physics major-junior-level
   electricity and magnetism. With the aim of educating our majors based on
   a more complete understanding of the cognitive and conceptual challenges
   of upper-division courses, we used principles of active engagement and
   learning theory to develop course materials and conceptual assessments.
   Our research results from student and faculty interviews and
   observations also informed our approach. We present several measures of
   the outcomes of this work at the University of Colorado at Boulder and
   external institutions. Students in the transformed courses achieved
   higher learning gains compared to those in the traditionally taught
   courses, particularly in the areas of conceptual understanding and
   ability to articulate their reasoning about a problem. The course
   transformations appear to close a gender gap, improving female students'
   scores on conceptual and traditional assessments so that they are more
   similar to those of male students. Students enthusiastically support the
   transformations, and indicate that several course elements provide
   useful scaffolding in conceptual understanding, as well as physicists'
   ``habits of mind'' such as problem-solving approaches and work habits.
   Despite these positive outcomes, student conceptual learning gains do
   not fully meet faculty expectations, suggesting that it is valuable to
   further investigate how the content and skills indicative of ``thinking
   like a physicist'' can be most usefully taught at the upper division.}},

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{34}},
Pages = {{12443-12456}},
Month = {{AUG 28}},
Abstract = {{The ``soft{''} (i.e., noncovalent) interactions between molecules and
   surfaces are complex and highly varied (e.g.; hydrophobic, hydrogen
   bonding, and ionic), often leading to heterogeneous interfacial
   behavior, Heterogeneity can arise either from the spatial Variation of
   the surface/interface itself or from molecular configurations (i.e.,
   conformation, orientation, aggregation state, etc.). By observing the
   adsorption, diffusion, and desorption of individual fluorescent
   molecules, single-molecule tracking can characterize these types of
   heterogeneous interfacial behavior in ways that are inaccessible to
   traditional ensemble-averaged methods. Moreover, the fluorescence
   intensity or emission wavelength (in resonance energy transfer
   experiments) can be used to track the molecular configuration and
   simultaneously directly relate this to the resulting interfacial
   mobility or affinity. In this feature article, we review recent advances
   involving the use of single molecule tracking. to characterize
   heterogeneous molecule surface interactions including multiple mode's of
   diffusion and desorption associated with both internal and external
   molecular configuration, Arrhenius-activated interfacial transport,
   spatially dependent interactions, and many more.}},

Title = {{Effect of lattice mismatch on phonon transmission and interface thermal
   conductance across dissimilar material interfaces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{When phonons transport across a material interface, they experience
   reflection, transmission, and mode conversion, which results in a local
   temperature jump at the interface and thus dramatically changes the
   thermal conductivity of nanostructured materials. Phonon transmission
   across lattice-matched interfaces has been studied extensively in recent
   years with the atomistic Green's function (AGF) approach, which usually
   uses one unit cell to represent the cross section along the interface.
   However, modeling phonon transmission across realistic material
   interfaces is much more challenging because realistic interfaces are
   usually lattice-mismatched ones with atomic reconstruction, defects, and
   species mixing, which demands a larger cross-sectional area for the AGF
   simulation. In this paper, an integrated molecular dynamics (MD) and AGF
   approach is developed to study the phonon transmission across
   lattice-mismatched interfaces. MD simulation is used to simulate atomic
   reconstruction close to the interface. The recursive AGF approach is
   then employed to calculate frequency-dependent phonon transmission
   across lattice-mismatched interfaces with defects and species mixing,
   which addresses the numerical challenge in calculating phonon
   transmission for a relatively large cross-sectional area with reduced
   computational cost. The study of the relaxed interface formed from two
   semi-infinite bulk materials shows that lattice mismatch increases the
   lattice disorder and decreases the adhesion energy, which in turn lowers
   phonon transmission and reduces the interface thermal conductance across
   lattice-mismatched interfaces. Low-frequency phonons can be
   significantly scattered by increasing the defect size across the
   interface, while high-frequency phonons can be scattered almost
   completely (phonon transmission < 0.1) across an alloyed layer as thin
   as 2.27 nm. The effect of lattice mismatch on phonon transmission
   becomes smaller for interfaces with defects and species mixing. The
   effect of annealing temperature on the Si/Ge interface thermal
   conductance was studied. A significant reduction of the Si/Ge interface
   thermal conductance was observed for a lattice-mismatched interface when
   annealed at high temperature, which agrees well with the available
   experimental data in literature.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Condensed matter systems with topological defects in the ground states
   range from the Abrikosov phases in superconductors, to various blue
   phases and twist grain boundary phases in liquid crystals, and to phases
   of skyrmion lattices in chiral ferromagnets and Bose-Einstein
   condensates. In nematic and chiral nematic liquid crystals, which are
   true fluids with long-range orientational ordering of constituent
   molecules, point and line defects spontaneously occur as a result of
   symmetry-breaking phase transitions or due to flow, but they are
   unstable, hard to control, and typically annihilate with time. Here we
   describe the optical generation of two-dimensional crystalline,
   quasicrystalline, and arbitrary ensembles of particlelike structures
   manifesting both skyrmionlike and Hopf fibration features-dubbed
   ``torons{''}-composed of looped double twist cylinders and point defects
   embedded in a uniform director field. In these two-dimensional lattices,
   we then introduce various dislocations, defects in positional ordering
   of the torons. We show that the periodic defect lattices with and
   without dislocation are light- and voltage-tunable reconfigurable
   two-dimensional diffraction gratings and can be used to generate various
   controlled phase singularities in the diffracted laser beams. The
   results of computer simulations of optical images, diffraction patterns,
   and phase distributions with optical vortices are in a good agreement
   with the corresponding experimental findings.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) on terrestrial
   water storage is analyzed for the time period 2003-2010 using monthly
   estimates of continental water storage from the Gravity Recovery and
   Climate Experiment (GRACE). Peak correlation between NOAA's Multivariate
   ENSO Index (MEI) and the measured mass anomaly timeseries shows an R-2
   of 0.65 for the Amazon Basin and Borneo in Southeast Asia. By including
   a Hilbert transformation of the MEI to account for time lag, the R-2 is
   improved to 0.76. Tropical regions show strong negative correlation with
   the MEI and arid regions are positively correlated. GRACE is able to
   detect all the significant known ENSO teleconnection patterns around the
   globe, including Alaska and Antarctica. In addition, a significant
   correlation suggests some of Greenland's recent mass loss could be

Abstract = {{The interactions between adsorbate molecules and hydrophobic surfaces
   are of significant interest due to their importance in a variety of
   biological and separation processes. However, it is challenging to
   extrapolate macroscopic ensemble-averaged force measurements to
   molecular-level phenomena. Using total internal reflection fluorescence
   microscopy to image individual molecules at hydrophobic solid aqueous
   interfaces, we directly observed dynamic behavior associated with the
   interactions between fluorescently labeled dodecanoic acid (our probe
   molecules) and self-assembled monolayers (SAM) comprising
   n-alkyltriethoxysilanes with systematically increasing chain length
   (from n = 4-18). In all cases, we observed at least two characteristic
   surface residence times and two diffusive modes, suggesting the presence
   of multiple distinct adsorbed populations. In general, the mean surface
   residence time increased and the mobility decreased with increasing SAM
   chain length, consistent with stronger probe surface interactions.
   However, these trends were not primarily due to changes in
   characteristic residence times or diffusion coefficients associated with
   the individual populations but rather to a dramatic increase in the
   fraction associated with the long-lived slow-moving population(s) on
   long-chain SAMs. In particular, on longer (16-18 carbon) alkylsilane
   monolayers, the probe molecule exhibited far fewer desorption-mediated
   ``flights{''} than on short (4-6 carbon) monolayers. Additionally,
   probes on the longer chain surfaces were much more likely to exhibit
   extended surface residence times as opposed to short transient surface
   visits.}},

Abstract = {{Materials that exhibit magnetic resonance have recently attracted
   interest for synthesizing exotic optical properties of metamaterials.
   However, none of the known naturally occurring materials are magnetic in
   the optical regime. Here, we present a metamaterial architecture that
   exhibits strong magnetic resonance at optical frequencies. The building
   blocks of the structure are aperiodic clusters of silver nanowires that
   reveal stronger magnetic resonance than their periodic counterparts. A
   particular realization exhibits more than three times stronger peak
   magnetic response than an equivalent periodic array. These results
   suggest that a larger design space is available for the generation of
   metamaterials. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Nuclear-modification factor for open-heavy-flavor production at forward
   rapidity in Cu plus Cu collisions at root s(NN)=200 GeV}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW C}},

Abstract = {{Background: Heavy-flavor production in p + p collisions is a good test
   of perturbative-quantum-chromodynamics (pQCD) calculations. Modification
   of heavy-flavor production in heavy-ion collisions relative to
   binary-collision scaling from p + p results, quantified with the
   nuclear-modification factor (R-AA), provides information on both
   cold-and hot-nuclear-matter effects. Midrapidity heavy-flavor R-AA
   measurements at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider have challenged
   parton-energy-loss models and resulted in upper limits on the
   viscosity-entropy ratio that are near the quantum lower bound. Such
   measurements have not been made in the forward-rapidity region.
   Purpose: Determine transverse-momentum (p(T)) spectra and the
   corresponding R-AA for muons from heavy-flavor meson decay in p + p and
   Cu + Cu collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV and y = 1.65.
   Method: Results are obtained using the semileptonic decay of
   heavy-flavor mesons into negative muons. The PHENIX muon-arm
   spectrometers measure the p(T) spectra of inclusive muon candidates.
   Backgrounds, primarily due to light hadrons, are determined with a Monte
   Carlo calculation using a set of input hadron distributions tuned to
   match measured-hadron distributions in the same detector and
   statistically subtracted.
   Results: The charm-production cross section in p + p collisions at root
   s = 200 GeV, integrated over p(T) and in the rapidity range 1.4 < y <
   1.9, is found to be d(sigma e (e) over bar)/dy = 0.139 +/- 0.029
   (stat)(-0.058)(+0.051) (syst) mb. This result is consistent with a
   perturbative fixed-order-plus-next-to-leading-log calculation within
   scale uncertainties and is also consistent with expectations based on
   the corresponding midrapidity charm-production cross section measured by
   PHENIX. The R-AA for heavy-flavor muons in Cu + Cu collisions is
   measured in three centrality bins for 1 < p(T) < 4 GeV/c. Suppression
   relative to binary-collision scaling (R-AA < 1) increases with
   centrality.
   Conclusions: Within experimental and theoretical uncertainties, the
   measured charm yield in p + p collisions is consistent with
   state-of-the-art pQCD calculations. Suppression in central Cu + Cu
   collisions suggests the presence of significant cold-nuclear-matter
   effects and final-state energy loss.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies on wetted, particle-particle collisions have been
   limited to head-on collisions, but in many-particle flows, collisions
   are inherently oblique. In this work, we explore such oblique collisions
   experimentally and theoretically. Whereas in normal collisions particles
   rebound only due to solid deformation, we observe in oblique collisions
   a new outcome where the particles initially form a rotating doublet and
   then deagglomerate at a later time due to so-called centrifugal forces.
   Surprisingly, we discover the essential role of capillary forces in
   oblique collisions even when the capillary number (viscous over
   capillary forces) is high. This recognition leads to the introduction of
   a dimensionless number, the centrifugal number (centrifugal over
   capillary forces), which together with the previously established Stokes
   number characterizes the regime map of outcomes. Unexpectedly, we
   observe a normal restitution coefficient greater than unity at large
   impact angles, the mechanism for which may also be observed in other
   agglomerating systems.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{We describe a soft matter system of self-organized oblate micelles and
   plasmonic gold nanorods that exhibit a negative orientational order
   parameter. Because of anisotropic surface anchoring interactions,
   colloidal gold nanorods tend to align perpendicular to the director
   describing the average orientation of normals to the discoidal micelles.
   Helicoidal structures of highly concentrated nanorods with a negative
   order parameter are realized by adding a chiral additive and are further
   controlled by means of confinement and mechanical stress.
   Polarization-sensitive absorption, scattering, and two-photon
   luminescence are used to characterize orientations and spatial
   distributions of nanorods. Self-alignment and effective-medium optical
   properties of these hybrid inorganic-organic complex fluids match
   predictions of a simple model based on anisotropic surface anchoring
   interactions of nanorods with the structured host medium.}},

   Migration-Dependent Aggregation}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 17}},
Abstract = {{During embryonic development, motile cells aggregate into cohesive
   groups, which give rise to tissues and organs. The role of cell
   migration in regulating aggregation is unclear. The current paradigm for
   aggregation is based on an equilibrium model of differential cell
   adhesivity to neighboring cells versus the underlying substratum. In
   many biological contexts, however, dynamics is critical. Here, we
   provide evidence that multicellular aggregation dynamics involves both
   local adhesive interactions and transport by cell migration. Using
   time-lapse video microscopy, we quantified the duration of cell-cell
   contacts among migrating cells that collided and adhered to another
   cell. This lifetime of cell-cell interactions exhibited a monotonic
   decreasing dependence on substratum adhesivity. Parallel quantitative
   measurements of cell migration speed revealed that across the tested
   range of adhesive substrata, the mean time needed for cells to migrate
   and encounter another cell was greater than the mean adhesion lifetime,
   suggesting that aggregation dynamics may depend on cell motility instead
   of the local differential adhesivity of cells. Consistent with this
   hypothesis, aggregate size exhibited a biphasic dependence on substratum
   adhesivity, matching the trend we observed for cell migration speed. Our
   findings suggest a new role for cell motility, alongside differential
   adhesion, in regulating developmental aggregation events and motivate
   new design principles for tuning aggregation dynamics in tissue
   engineering applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background. While the importance of fluid dynamical conditions is well
   recognized in the growth of biofilms, their role during bacteremia is
   unknown. We examined the impact of physiological fluid shear forces on
   the development of multicellular aggregates of Klebsiella pneumoniae.
   Methods. Wild-type and O-antigen or capsular mutants of K. pneumoniae
   were grown as broth culture in a Taylor-Couette flow cell configured to
   provide continuous shear forces comparable to those encountered in the
   human arterial circulation (ie, on the order of 1.0 Pa). The size
   distribution and antibiotic resistance of aggregates formed in this
   apparatus were determined, as was their ability to persist in the
   bloodstream of mice following intravenous injection.
   Results. Unlike growth in shaking flasks, bacteria grown in the test
   apparatus readily formed aggregates, a phenotype largely absent in
   capsular mutants and to a lesser degree in O-antigen mutants. Aggregates
   were found to persist in the bloodstream of mice. Importantly, organisms
   grown under physiological shear were found to have an antibiotic
   resistance phenotype intermediate between that of fully planktonic and
   biofilm states.
   Conclusions. When grown under intravascular-magnitude fluid dynamic
   conditions, K. pneumoniae spontaneously develops into multicellular
   aggregates that are capable of persisting in the circulation and exhibit
   increased antibiotic resistance.}},

Title = {{Influence of canopy structure and direct beam solar irradiance on

Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{46-56}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Sub-canopy snow ablation rates were measured for three years at forested
   research plots in the Sierra Nevada, California with a network of 24
   automated snow depth sensors and monthly snow density surveys. Snow
   ablation rates, in mm SWE day(-1), specific to each depth sensor
   location were estimated as the seasonal maximum SWE divided by the
   number of days from peak SWE to snow disappearance. Estimates of
   sub-canopy direct beam solar irradiance and sky view factor (SVF theta)
   derived from hemispherical photographs were used to explain the spatial
   distribution of snow ablation rates. Cumulative direct beam irradiance
   during the observed snowmelt periods explained the most variability in
   snow ablation rates for the most cloud-free melt season (58\% in 2008; 4
   cloudy days; at 15 sensor locations snowmelt duration ranged from 39
   days to 88 days and direct irradiance ranged from 96 MJ m(-2) to 603 MJ
   m(-2)) and explained the least ablation variability for the cloudiest
   melt season of the study (29\% in 2009; 23 cloudy days; at 12 sensor
   locations snowmelt duration ranged from 45 days to 79 days and direct
   irradiance ranged from 121 MJ m(-2) to 410 MJ m(-2)). Conversely, sky
   view factor (SVF theta) explained the most variability in snow ablation
   rates under cloudier conditions (i.e. 87\% in 2009) and the
   relationships were strongest when developed over the entire hemisphere
   (i.e. SVF90 degrees, which ranged from 0.17 to 0.31). Combined, the two
   metrics studied here (sub-canopy direct beam irradiance and SVF theta)
   may be used to explain much of the observed plot-scale variability in
   SWE ablation at finer time scales relevant to snow and hydrological
   model applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular layer deposition (MLD) techniques were used to grow
   titanium-containing hybrid organic inorganic films known as
   ``titanicones{''} using F. titanium tetrachloride (TiCl4) and either
   ethylene glycol (EG) or glycerol (GL). The surface chemistry for
   titanicone MLD was self-limiting versus TiCl4 and either EG or GL
   exposures. Quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) measurements observed a
   film growth rate of similar to 83 ng/cm(2)/cycle using TiCl4 and EG from
   90 to 115 degrees C. The growth rate then decreased significantly at 135
   degrees C. X-ray reflectivity (XRR) studies yielded a growth rate of
   similar to 4.5 angstrom/cycle with a constant density of similar to 1.8
   g/cm(3) from 90 to 115 degrees C. The growth rate measured using XRR
   also decreased to 1.5 angstrom/cycle at 135 degrees C. Titanicone films
   were grown using TiCl4 and GL at higher temperatures between 130 and 210
   degrees C. GL should increase the bridging between the polymer chains in
   the titanicone film and change film properties and improve film
   stability. The film growth rates decreased with temperature from 49
   ng/cm(2)/cycle at 130 degrees C to 34 ng/cm(2)/cycle at 210 degrees C.
   XRR studies were consistent with a temperature-dependent film growth and
   measured growth rates of 2.8 angstrom/cycle at 130 degrees C and 2.1
   angstrom/cycle at 210 degrees C. Nanoindentation experiments revealed
   that the elastic modulus and hardness of the titanicone films grown
   using GL were much higher than titanicone films grown using EG.
   Annealing the titanicone films to 600 degrees C in air removed the
   carbon constituents and yielded TiO2 films with a density of similar to
   3.3 g/cm(3) that is slightly higher than the density of TiO2 ALD films
   grown at 115 degrees C. The titanicone films absorbed light in the
   ultraviolet, and the absorption threshold was consistent with an optical
   bandgap of similar to 3.6 eV. Prolonged ultraviolet exposures on the
   titanicone films produced TiO2 films with a low density of 2.7 g/cm(3).}},

Abstract = {{We report new observations by the Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP)
   instrument on the New Horizons spacecraft of an energy-per-charge (E/q)
   spectrum of interstellar pick-up ions (PUIs) from an unprecedented
   heliocentric distance of 17 AU. This E/q spectrum is fit well by an
   isotropic PUI distribution function combined with the detailed response
   of the SWAP instrument. In contrast to earlier work, we are also able to
   fit an isotropic PUI model to an E/q spectrum measured by SWAP at 11.3
   AU by explicitly including two additional effects. These are (1) the
   E/q-dependent geometric factor of SWAP, which increases with decreasing
   E/q owing to effects associated with the post-acceleration of particles
   exiting the electrostatic analyzer portion of the instrument; and (2) a
   solar wind distribution, the model spectrum of which contributes
   significantly to the low-E/q part of the overall model owing,
   presumably, to secondary particles produced within the instrument.}},

Abstract = {{An explicit integration algorithm for computations of discontinuous wave
   propagation in heterogeneous solids is presented, which is aimed at
   minimizing spurious oscillations when the wave fronts pass through
   several zones of different wave speeds. The essence of the present
   method is a combination of two wave capturing characteristics: a new
   integration formula that is obtained by pushforwardpullback operations
   in time designed to filter post-shock oscillations, and the central
   difference method that intrinsically filters front-shock oscillations.
   It is shown that a judicious combination of these two characteristics
   substantially reduces both spurious front-shock and post-shock
   oscillations. The performance of the new method is demonstrated as
   applied to wave propagation through a uniform bar with varying courant
   numbers, then to heterogeneous bars. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{We develop a parallel fully implicit domain decomposition algorithm for
   solving optimization problems constrained by time-dependent nonlinear
   partial differential equations. In particular, we study the boundary
   control of unsteady incompressible NavierStokes equations. After an
   implicit discretization in time, a fully coupled sparse nonlinear
   optimization problem needs to be solved at each time step. The class of
   full space LagrangeNewtonKrylovSchwarz algorithms is used to solve the
   sequence of optimization problems. Among optimization algorithms, the
   fully implicit full space approach is considered to be the easiest to
   formulate and the hardest to solve. We show that
   LagrangeNewtonKrylovSchwarz, with a one-level restricted additive
   Schwarz preconditioner, is an efficient class of methods for solving
   these hard problems. To demonstrate the scalability and robustness of
   the algorithm, we consider several problems with a wide range of
   Reynolds numbers and time step sizes, and we present numerical results
   for large-scale calculations involving several million unknowns obtained
   on machines with more than 1000 processors. Copyright (c) 2012 John

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SOLID EARTH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Despite an overall sinistral slip rate of approximate to 3 cm/yr, few
   major earthquakes have occurred in the past 200 years along the Chaman
   fault system, the western boundary of the India Plate with the Eurasia
   Plate. GPS and InSAR data reported here indicate sinistral shear
   velocities of 8-17 mm/yr across the westernmost branches of the fault
   system, suggesting that a significant fraction of the plate boundary
   slip is distributed in the fold and fault belt to the east. At its
   southernmost on-land segment (approximate to 26 degrees N), near the
   triple junction between the Arabia, Eurasia, and India Plates, we find
   the velocity across the Ornach Nal fault is 15.1(+13.4)(+16.9) mm/yr,
   with a locking depth probably less than 3 km. At latitude 30 degrees N
   near the town of Chaman, Pakistan, where a M6.5 earthquake occurred in
   1892, the velocity is 8.5(+6.8)(+10.3) mm/yr and the fault is locked at
   approximately 3.4 km depth. At latitude 33 degrees N and further north,
   InSAR data indicate a velocity across the Chaman fault of 16.8 +/- 2.7
   mm/yr. The width of the plate boundary varies from several km in the
   south where we observe approximate to 2 mm/yr of convergence near the
   westernmost strike-slip faults, to a few hundreds of km in the north
   where we observe 6-9 mm/yr of convergence, and where the faulting
   becomes distinctly transpressional. The shallow locking depth along much
   of the transform system suggests that earthquakes larger than those that
   have occurred in the historical record would be unexpected, and that the
   recurrence interval of those earthquakes that have occurred is of the
   order of one or two centuries, similar in length to the known historical
   record.}},

Abstract = {{The surface of silicon nanocrystals embedded in an oxide matrix can

   Dangling-bond defects are nearly eliminated by H2 passivation, thus
   decreasing absorption below the quantum-confined bandgap and enhancing
   PL efficiency by an order of magnitude. However, there remain numerous
   other defects seen in absorption by photothermal deflection
   spectroscopy; these defects cause non-radiative recombination that
   limits the PL efficiency to <15\%. Using atomistic pseudopotential
   simulations, we attribute these defects to two specific types of
   distorted bonds: Si-Si and bridging Si-O-Si bonds between two Si atoms

Abstract = {{In June 2010, the NOAA WP-3D aircraft conducted two survey flights
   around the Deepwater Horizon (DWH) oil spill. The Gulf oil spill
   resulted in an isolated source of secondary organic aerosol (SOA)
   precursors in a relatively clean environment. Measurements of aerosol
   composition and volatile organic species (VOCs) indicated formation of
   SOA from intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) downwind of
   the oil spill (Science 2011, 331, doi 10.1126/science.1200320). In an
   effort to better understand formation of SOA in this environment, we
   present mass spectral characteristics of SOA in the Gulf and of SOA
   formed in the laboratory from evaporated light crude oil. Compared to
   urban primary organic aerosol, high-mass-resolution analysis of the
   background-subtracted SOA spectra in the Gulf (for short, ``Gulf
   SOA{''}) showed higher contribution of CxHyO+ relative to CxHy+
   fragments at the same nominal mass. In each transect downwind of the DWH
   spill site, a gradient in the degree of oxidation of the Gulf SOA was
   observed: more oxidized SOA (oxygen/carbon = O/C similar to 0.4 was
   observed in the area impacted by fresher oil; less oxidized SOA (O/C
   similar to 0.3), with contribution from fragments with a hydrocarbon
   backbone, was found in a broader region of more-aged surface oil.
   Furthermore, in the plumes originating from the more-aged oil,
   contribution of oxygenated fragments to SOA decreased with downwind
   distance. Despite differences between experimental conditions in the
   laboratory and the ambient environment, mass spectra of SOA formed from
   gas-phase oxidation of crude oil by OH radicals in a smog chamber and a
   flow tube reactor strongly resembled the mass spectra of Gulf SOA (r(2)
   > 0.94). Processes that led to the observed Gulf SOA characteristics are
   also likely to occur in polluted regions where VOCs and IVOCs are
   coemitted.}},

Title = {{Increasing atmospheric burden of ethanol in the United States}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{The use of ethanol as a transportation fuel in the U.S. increased
   significantly from 2000-2009, and in 2010 nearly all gasoline contained
   10\% ethanol. In accordance with this increased use, atmospheric
   measurements of volatile organic compounds in Los Angeles in 2010 were
   significantly enriched in ethanol compared to measurements in urban
   outflow in the Northeast U. S. in 2002 and 2004. Mixing ratios of
   acetaldehyde, an atmospheric oxidation product of ethanol, decreased
   between 2002 and 2010 in Los Angeles. Previous work has suggested that
   large-scale use of ethanol may have detrimental effects on air quality.
   While we see no evidence for this in the U. S., our study indicates that
   ethanol has become a ubiquitous compound in urban air and that better
   measurements are required to monitor its increase and effects.}},

Abstract = {{Many of the immune and metabolic changes occurring during normal
   pregnancy also describe metabolic syndrome. Gut microbiota can cause
   symptoms of metabolic syndrome in nonpregnant hosts. Here, to explore
   their role in pregnancy, we characterized fecal bacteria of 91 pregnant
   women of varying prepregnancy BMIs and gestational diabetes status and
   their infants. Similarities between infant-mother microbiotas increased
   with children's age, and the infant microbiota was unaffected by
   mother's health status. Gut microbiota changed dramatically from first
   (T1) to third (T3) trimesters, with vast expansion of diversity between
   mothers, an overall increase in Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria, and
   reduced richness. T3 stool showed strongest signs of inflammation and
   energy loss; however, microbiome gene repertoires were constant between
   trimesters. When transferred to germ-free mice, T3 microbiota induced
   greater adiposity and insulin insensitivity compared to T1. Our findings
   indicate that host-microbial interactions that impact host metabolism
   can occur and may be beneficial in pregnancy.}},

Title = {{Strategies for the multi-residue analysis of 100 pesticides by liquid

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1249}},
Pages = {{164-180}},
Month = {{AUG 3}},
Abstract = {{Analytical strategies for screening, quantitation and confirmation of a
   group of 100 pesticides in fruit and vegetable samples by LC-MS and
   LC-MS/MS were developed. The pesticides studied belong to different
   chemical families of herbicides, insecticides and fungicides. A
   selection of some degradation products was also included.
   Chromatographic separation was performed using a Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C8
   column (150 mm x 4.6 mm and 5 mu m particle size), and gradient elution
   with acetonitrile-water (both with 0.1\% formic acid) as mobile phase.
   LC-MS/MS using highly-selective selected reaction monitoring (H-SRM)
   acquisition mode monitoring two transitions for each compound showed to
   be the most sensitive methodology. Quantitation was carried out using
   matrix-matched standard calibration and good linearity of response was
   demonstrated (r > 0.998). Limits of detection (by acquiring two
   transitions and with the ion-ratio requirements) ranged between 0.01 and
   20 mu g/kg were obtained. So, in general, the sensitivity achieved meets
   the maximum residue levels (MRLs) established by the European Union
   regulation for food monitoring programs. Pesticide confirmation was
   carried out following European Union guidelines. In order to prevent
   false-positives, further confirmatory strategies were proposed. LC-MS in
   highly-selective selected ion monitoring (H-SIM) mode with accurate mass
   measurement was used to obtain an orthogonal criterion (exact mass) for
   confirmation. Accurate mass measurements were always bellow 0.9 mDa for
   almost all pesticides studied (similar to those described with TOF
   instruments). A user reversed energy ramp (RER) product ion scan spectra
   library was generated by means of a data dependent analysis for routine
   library searching of pesticides. The combination of LC-MS/MS in H-SRM
   mode and the generation of the RER product ion scan spectra and library
   search were then used to achieve further confirmation on pesticide
   analysis. The LC-MS and LC-MS/MS strategies developed were successfully
   applied for the analysis and confirmation of pesticides in different
   types of fruit and vegetables samples, and examples of the screening,
   quantitation and confirmation of pesticides in these samples are shown
   in this work. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   porous films with varying monomer-crosslinker ratios, by photo-induced

   size and showed higher degree of ordering, due to the interplay between
   the solvent evaporation and crosslinking reaction. The pore morphology
   remains similar despite varying film compositions, suggesting that the
   pore-fixing process is still dominated by the solvent evaporation
   similar to that of conventional breath figure process, and is less
   dependent on the crosslinking process. Detailed characterizations of the
   chemical and physical properties, including the glass transition
   temperature, thermal stability, and surface wettability of the porous

Abstract = {{Seismic loading rates can significantly affect the behavior of
   reinforced concrete (RC) elements. However, few data are available to
   quantify these effects. Shaking table tests allow the study of loading
   rate phenomena; however, they suffer from difficulties in assessing
   causality (direct assessment of causes on effects) and are expensive to
   conduct. An alternative is to test individual RC elements by directly
   imparting high-velocity loading protocols. However, multiactuator setups
   are necessary to achieve seismically representative loading and boundary
   conditions, which entails particularly challenging control requirements.
   This investigation makes use of recent advances in real-time testing
   hardware to study the effects of loading rates on the structural
   response of lightly confined RC columns. A pioneering test setup in
   which three actuators are controlled independently at high velocities
   was used to test a series of columns until axial collapse. The
   experimental challenges and column behavior are discussed. DOI:

Abstract = {{Safety performance in the construction industry has improved
   significantly in the past four decades. This improvement has been
   attributed in part to the increased implementation of injury prevention
   strategies. Although the relative effectiveness of these strategies has
   been studied in previous research, there has been no attempt to evaluate
   their diffusion. To address this gap in knowledge, 12 highly effective
   administrative safety innovations were identified in literature, and 58
   firms were interviewed to investigate their adoption rate. The diffusion
   patterns of the identified safety innovations were explored using four
   common innovation diffusion models: the internal, external, Bass, and
   Gompetz. The findings indicate that the internal and Bass models have
   the highest explanatory power and that internal factors are the most
   influential factors in adoption of safety innovations by construction
   firms. It was also found that project-specific training and safety
   meetings (91\%), frequent worksite inspections (91\%), and safety and
   health orientation and training (90\%) are the three most commonly
   adopted safety innovations, and employment of a site safety manager
   (62\%), subcontractor selection and management (64\%), and substance
   abuse programs (69\%) were the three innovations most infrequently
   implemented. The implication of the findings is that the construction
   industry has now reached saturation with respect to traditional injury
   prevention strategies and new safety innovations are needed. DOI:

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: In air pollution time-series studies, the temporal pattern
   of the association of fine particulate matter (PM2.5; particulate matter
   <= 2.5 mu m in aerodynamic diameter) and health end points has been
   observed to vary by disease category. The lag pattern of PM2.5 chemical
   constituents has not been well investigated, largely because daily data
   have not been available.
   OBJECTIVES: We explored the lag structure for hospital admissions using
   daily PM2.5 chemical constituent data for 5 years in the Denver Aerosol
   Sources and Health (DASH) study.
   METHODS: We measured PM2.5 constituents, including elemental carbon,
   organic carbon, sulfate, and nitrate, at a central residential site from
   2003 through 2007 and linked these daily pollution data to daily
   hospital admission counts in the five-county Denver metropolitan area.
   Total hospital admissions and subcategories of respiratory and
   cardiovascular admissions were examined. We assessed the lag structure
   of relative risks (RRs) of hospital admissions for PM2.5 and four
   constituents on the same day and from 1 to 14 previous days from a
   constrained distributed lag model; we adjusted for temperature,
   humidity, longer-term temporal trends, and day of week using a
   generalized additive model.
   RESULTS: RRs were generally larger at shorter lags for total
   cardiovascular admissions but at longer lags for total respiratory
   admissions. The delayed lag pattern was particularly prominent for
   asthma. Elemental and organic carbon generally showed more immediate
   patterns, whereas sulfate and nitrate showed delayed patterns.
   CONCLUSION: In general, PM2.5 chemical constituents were found to have
   more immediate estimated effects on cardiovascular diseases and more
   delayed estimated effects on respiratory diseases, depending somewhat on
   the constituent.}},

Title = {{Intravitreal Silicon-Based Quantum Dots as Neuroprotective Factors in a

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To study the intravitreal application of silicon quantum dots
   (QDs) and their capabilities to deliver electrical stimulation to the
   retinal cells and to assess the potential effect on retinal
   electrophysiology and anatomy.
   METHODS. A Royal College of Surgeon rat model of retinal degeneration
   was used in this study. A total of 32 eyes were used, divided in four
   groups of 8 eyes each; the first group received the silicon-based QD,
   the second group received an inactive gold-based QD, the third group
   received a sham injection, and the fourth group was used as a control.
   An electroretinogram (ERG) was done at baseline and thereafter every
   week for 9 weeks. At the end of the follow-up, eyes were collected for
   further pathologic analysis and nuclei cell counts.
   RESULTS. Eyes within the silicon-based QD group showed a definite but
   transient increase in the waves of the ERG, especially in the rod
   response compared with the sham and control groups (P < 0.05). The
   pathologic examination demonstrated a higher nuclei count in the QD
   group, consistent with a higher cell survival rate than that in the sham
   and control groups in which cells degenerated as expected.
   CONCLUSIONS. Intravitreal injection of silicon-based QD seems to be safe
   and well tolerated, with no evident toxic reaction and demonstrates a
   beneficial effect by prolonging cell survival rate and improving ERG
   patterns in a well-established model of retinal degeneration.

Title = {{Continuum representation of a continuous size distribution of particles
   engaged in rapid granular flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Natural and industrial granular flows often consist of several particle
   sizes, approximately forming a continuous particle size distribution
   (PSD). Continuous PSDs are ubiquitous, though existing
   kinetic-theory-based, hydrodynamic models for rapid granular flows are
   limited to a discrete number of species. The objective of this work is
   twofold: (i) to determine the number of discrete species required to
   accurately approximate a continuous PSD and (ii) to validate these
   results via a comparison with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of
   continuous PSDs. With regard to the former, several analytic (Gaussian
   and lognormal) and experimental (coal and lunar soil simulants)
   distributions are investigated. Transport coefficients (pressure, shear
   viscosity, etc.) of the granular mixture given by the polydisperse
   theory of Garzo et al. {[}{''}Enskog theory for polydisperse granular
   mixtures. I. Navier-Stokes order transport,{''} Phys. Rev. E 76, 031303
   (2007); ``Enskog theory for polydisperse granular mixtures. I.
   Navier-Stokes order transport,{''} 76, 031304 (2007)] are compared using
   an increasing number of species s to approximate the given PSD. These
   discrete approximations are determined by matching the first 2s moments
   of the approximation and the given continuous distribution. Relatively
   few species are required to approximate moderately wide distributions
   (Gaussian, lognormal), whereas even wider distributions (coal and lunar
   soil simulants) require a larger number of species. Regarding the second
   objective, a comparison between MD simulations and kinetic-theory
   predictions for a simple shear flow of both Gaussian and lognormal PSDs
   reveal essentially no loss of accuracy stemming from the polydisperse
   theory itself (as compared to theories for monodisperse systems) or from
   the discrete approximations of continuous PSDs used in the polydisperse
   theory. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{As part of the DART06B observational campaign in late August 2006, a
   microstructure profiler was deployed to make turbulence measurements in
   the upper layers of the Southern Adriatic Sea. Of the nearly 300 total
   casts, 163 were made near Station B90, where various moorings were
   deployed in the 90 m deep water column to measure water column
   properties and meteorological and surface wave conditions. We were able
   to measure turbulence properties in the upper layers under a variety of
   atmospheric forcing conditions that included strong wind forcing,
   night-time convection, mixed convection and wind forcing, weak wind
   forcing and strong insolation. The resulting dataset provides a
   kaleidoscope of turbulence properties and turbulent mixing above, below
   and in the strong pycnocline present at a depth of 15-25 m in the
   coastal waters of the Southern Adriatic Sea during late summer. A
   slightly modified scaling of the dissipation rate of turbulence kinetic
   energy in the Mixed Layer (ML), based on the observed friction velocity
   u({*}) and the surface buoyancy flux J(b0), reproduces the measured
   values reasonably well. In the interior, below the ML, the dissipation
   rate scales like (LTN3)-N-2, where L-T is the Thorpe scale and N is the
   buoyancy frequency. Analysis of velocity and density profile
   measurements from Station B90 and the nearby Station B75 suggest that
   anticyclonic eddies and near-inertial waves can interact in these
   coastal waters to produce significant horizontal advective density
   fluxes in the pycnocline. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel nonthermal plasma dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) system for
   decontamination, sterilization, and medical applications has been
   developed. The discharge is physically removed from the disinfection
   zone, and plasma-induced free radicals are delivered through an air
   stream. The physical distance between the discharge and the treatment
   surface can be up to 3 m, making the technology robust and flexible for
   applications in the medical clinic. The bactericidal properties of the
   free-radical effluent are enhanced by hydrogen peroxide additives. We
   report a 6-log reduction in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas
   aeruginosa bacteria strains in under 1 min of exposure in vitro and
   inactivation of Bacillus atrophaes spores and Escherichia coli biofilms.
   The concentration of hydrogen peroxide additives is seen to be a key
   variable in inactivation efficacy, suggesting that active species in our
   experiment may be different than in other DBD configurations. Precise
   chemical concentration measurements using direct frequency comb
   spectroscopy show presence of ozone (O-3), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2),
   nitrous oxide (N2O), and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). In vivo multiple
   exposures of mouse skin to the plasma effluent do not yield any adverse

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 is applied on a polypropylene
   separator for lithium-ion batteries. A thin Al2O3 layer (<10 nm) is
   coated on every surface of the porous polymer microframework without
   significantly increasing the total separator thickness. The thin Al2O3
   ALD coating results in significantly suppressed thermal shrinkage, which
   may lead to improved safety of the batteries. More importantly, the
   wettability of Al2O3 ALD-coated separators in an extremely polar
   electrolyte based on pure propylene carbonate (PC) solvent is
   demonstrated, without any decrease in electrochemical performances such
   as capacity, rate capability, and cycle life. Finally, a LiCoO2/natural
   graphite full cell is demonstrated under extremely severe conditions
   (pure PC-based electrolyte and high (4.5 V) upper cut-off potential),
   which is enabled by the Al2O3 ALD coating on all three components
   (cathode, anode, and separator).}},

Abstract = {{Photoinitiated polymerization remains a robust method for fabrication of
   hydrogels, as these reactions allow facile spatial and temporal control
   of gelation and high compatibility for encapsulation of cells and
   biologics. The chain-growth reaction of rnacromolecular monomers, such
   as acrylated PEG and hyaluronan, is commonly used to form hydrogels, but
   there is growing interest in step-growth photopolymerizations, such as
   the thiol-ene ``click{''} reaction, as an alternative. Thiol-ene
   reactions are not susceptible to oxygen inhibition and rapidly form
   hydrogels using low initiator concentrations. In this work, we
   characterize the differences in recovery of bioactive proteins when
   exposed to similar photoinitiation conditions during thiol-ene versus
   acrylate polymerizations. Following exposure to chain polymerization of
   acrylates, lysozyme bioactivity was approximately 50\%; after step
   growth thiol-ene reaction, lysozyme retained nearly 100\% of its
   prereaction activity. Bioactive protein recovery was enhanced 1000-fold
   in the presence of a thiol-ene reaction, relative to recovery from
   solutions containing identical primary radical concentrations, but
   without the thiol-ene components. When the cytokine TGF beta was
   encapsulated in PEG hydrogels formed via the thiol-ene reaction, full
   protein bioactivity was preserved.}},

   measurement topology, system design, and qualification, as well as the
   design and optimization of the probe circuit and equivalent microwave
   circuit. The system noise floor is measured and noise-limiting elements
   are identified. A calibration method is discussed that allows for the
   quantitative extraction of the tip-sample impedance and enables
   tip-sample modeling. Several demonstration measurements are provided
   that show differentiation of not just metals and dielectrics, but
   compound targets. Additionally, resolution of 10-m features at the
   surface are demonstrated with a factor of 4 degradation in spatial
   resolution at a depth approximately equal to the tip diameter.}},

Abstract = {{Flash sintering of strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is studied at different
   applied fields to understand its effect on density and grain growth. In
   particular, the defect structure is investigated by optical and
   structural analysis. SrTiO3 exhibited a trend in densification opposite
   that of ionically or electronically conductive ceramics: as the applied
   voltage decreased, the density increased. Abnormal grain growth in
   conventionally sintered SrTiO3 is arrested by flash sintering.
   Interestingly, undoped SrTiO3 behaved differently than undoped Al2O3,
   which did not exhibit any signs of flash sintering. Previous attempts at
   flash sintering could only be achieved in MgO-doped Al2O3. We believe
   that non-stoichiometric Ruddlesden-Popper phases in SrTiO3, as indicated
   by ultrafast optical spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, conductivity
   measurements, and transmission electron microscopy, assist flash
   sintering by increasing local conductivity through enhanced defect
   content.}},

Abstract = {{Although imperfect spatial localization in single-molecule object
   tracking experiments has long been recognized to induce apparent motion
   in an immobile population of molecules, this effect is often ignored or
   incorrectly analyzed for mobile molecules. In particular, apparent
   motion due to positional uncertainty is often incorrectly assigned as a
   distinct diffusive mode. Here we show that, due to both static and
   dynamic contributions, positional uncertainty does not introduce a new
   apparent diffusive mode into trajectories, but instead causes a
   systematic shift of each measured diffusion coefficient. This shift is
   relatively simple: a factor of sigma(2)/Delta t is added to each
   diffusion coefficient, where sigma is the positional uncertainty length
   scale and Delta t is the time interval between observations. Therefore,
   by calculating the apparent diffusion coefficients as a function of
   Delta t, it is straightforward to separate the true diffusion
   coefficients from the effective positional uncertainty. As a concrete
   demonstration, we apply this approach to the diffusion of the protein
   fibrinogen adsorbed to a hydrophobic surface, a system that exhibits
   three distinct modes of diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{In the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, stream biota is limited by the
   brief availability of liquid water. The benthic microbial mats harbor
   diatoms that have adapted to hydrologic stresses, including numerous
   endemic species. We found a strong relationship between diatom community
   composition and flow intermittency in a data set including seven streams
   that spanned a gradient in flow intermittency. In particular, two genera
   represented by numerous endemic species in Dry Valley habitats,
   Hantzschia and Luticola, had high abundances in moderately and highly
   intermittent streams, respectively. The Shannon Index of diversity was
   greatest in streams with intermediate flow intermittency, with lower
   diversity in more stable streams resulting from lower evenness, and
   lower diversity in highly intermittent streams resulting from lower
   richness. These results indicate that multiple metrics of biodiversity
   may be useful in assessing the response of diatom communities to
   changing hydrologic regime. We propose that flow intermittency acts as a
   species filter that increases habitat heterogeneity in Dry Valley
   streams and may allow endemic species to persist. Future Antarctic
   warming may alter diatom community composition and habitats that act as
   refugia for desiccation-tolerant taxa.}},

Abstract = {{Forward directivity may cause large velocity pulses in ground motion
   time histories that are damaging to buildings at sites close to faults,
   potentially increasing seismic collapse risk. This study quantifies the
   effects of forward directivity on collapse risk through incremental
   dynamic analysis of building simulation models that are capable of
   capturing the key aspects of strength and stiffness degradation
   associated with structural collapse. The paper also describes a method
   for incorporating the effects of near-fault directivity in probabilistic
   assessment of seismic collapse risk. The analysis is based on a suite of
   RC frame models that represent both past and present building code
   provisions, subjected to a database of near-fault, pulse-like ground
   motions with varying pulse periods. Results show that the predicted
   collapse capacity is strongly influenced by variations in pulse period
   and building ductility; pulse periods that are longer than the
   first-mode elastic building period tend to be the most damaging. A
   detailed assessment of seismic collapse risk shows that the predicted
   probability of collapse in 50?years for modern concrete buildings at a
   representative near-fault site is approximately 6\%, which is
   significantly higher than the 1\% probability in the far-field region
   targeted by current seismic design maps in the US. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {{The degree-of-freedom (DoF) regions are characterized for the
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) broadcast channel (BC),
   interference channels (ICs), including X and multihop ICs, and the
   cognitive radio channel (CRC), when there is no channel state
   information at the transmitter(s) (CSIT) and for fading distributions in
   which transmit directions are statistically indistinguishable. For the
   K-user MIMO BC, the exact DoF region is obtained, which shows that time
   division is DoF-region optimal. For the two-user MIMO IC and CRC, inner
   and outer bounds are obtained that coincide for a vast majority of the
   relative numbers of antennas at the four terminals. Finally, the DoF of
   the K-user MIMO IC, the CRC, and X networks are obtained for certain
   classes of these networks. The results herein are derived for fading
   distributions and additive noises that are more general than those
   considered in other simultaneous related works. The DoF with and without
   CSIT are compared and conditions under which a lack of CSIT does, or
   does not, result in the loss of DoF are identified, thereby 1) providing
   robust no-CSIT schemes that have the same DoF as their previously found
   CSIT counterparts and 2) identifying situations where CSI feedback to
   transmitters would provide gains that are significant enough that even
   the DoF could be improved.}},

Abstract = {{Noncollocated sensors and actuators, and/or fast sample rates with
   plants having high relative degree, can lead to nonminimum-phase (NMP)
   discrete-time zero dynamics that complicate the control system design.
   In this paper, we examine three stable approximate model-inverse
   feedforward control techniques, the nonminimum-phase zeros ignore
   (NPZ-Ignore), the zero-phase-error tracking controller (ZPETC), and the
   zero-magnitude-error tracking controller (ZMETC), which have frequently
   been used for NMP systems. We analyze how the discrete-time NMP zero
   locations in the z-plane affect the success of the NPZ-Ignore, ZPETC,
   and ZMETC model-inverse techniques. We also examine the use of low-pass
   filters with the three model-inversion techniques. Experimental results
   on the x direction of an AFM piezoscanner are provided to support the
   discussions. Tips on the use of these three model-inversion
   discrete-time feedforward methods are presented throughout the paper.

Abstract = {{Fossil fuel emissions aside, temperate North America is a net sink of
   carbon dioxide at present(1-3). Year-to-year variations in this carbon
   sink are linked to variations in hydroclimate that affect net ecosystem
   productivity(3,4). The severity and incidence of climatic extremes,
   including drought, have increased as a result of climate warming(5-8).
   Here, we examine the effect of the turn of the century drought in
   western North America on carbon uptake in the region, using reanalysis
   data, remote sensing observations and data from global monitoring
   networks. We show that the area-integrated strength of the western North
   American carbon sink declined by 30-298 Tg C yr(-1) during the 2000-2004
   drought. We further document a pronounced drying of the terrestrial
   biosphere during this period, together with a reduction in river
   discharge and a loss of cropland productivity. We compare our findings
   with previous palaeoclimate reconstructions(7) and show that the last
   drought of this magnitude occurred more than 800 years ago. Based on
   projected changes in precipitation and drought severity, we estimate
   that the present mid-latitude carbon sink of 177-623 Tg C yr(-1) in
   western North America could disappear by the end of the century.}},

Title = {{Stress relaxation of trithiocarbonate-dimethacrylate-based dental

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. To reduce polymerization-induced shrinkage stress while
   maintaining mechanical properties, reversible addition-fragmentation
   chain transfer (RAFT)-capable functional groups were incorporated into a
   photopolymerizable dimethacrylate-based dental composite. We hypothesize
   that the incorporation of trithiocarbonate-based RAFT functional groups
   into conventional dimethacrylate dental resins will reduce
   polymerization stress.
   Methods. A trithiocarbonate dimethacrylate (TTCDMA) monomer, capable of
   undergoing radical-mediated RAFT, is mixed with 70 wt\% BisGMA
   (bisphenylglycidyl dimethacrylate) and compared to a conventional dental
   resin comprised of TEGDMA (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) and 70
   wt\% BisGMA. The shrinkage stress and methacrylate conversion were
   simultaneously measured during polymerization. The fracture toughness
   and elastic modulus were measured to evaluate the effect of the TTCDMA
   monomer on the mechanical properties. All the materials used herein were
   evaluated as a composite, including 75 wt\% silica fillers. ANOVA (CI
   95\%) was conducted to assess the differences between the means.
   Results. The TTCDMA composite exhibited a 65\% stress reduction compared
   with TEGDMA-BisGMA though the reaction rate was slower than the
   conventional dental composite, owing to the additional RAFT reaction.
   The fracture toughness and elastic modulus of the TTCDMA-based composite
   were not significantly different than in the TEGDMA-based composite,
   while the T-g was decreased by 30 degrees C to 155 +/- 2 degrees C.
   Significance. Despite only replacing the reactive-diluent, significant
   and dramatic stress reduction was observed while maintaining the elastic
   modulus and fracture toughness. This new RAFT-capable monomer shows
   great promise to replace the reactive diluent in BisGMA-based dental
   materials. Formulation optimization and further exploration of other
   RAFT-capable functional groups will provide further stress reduction in
   dental materials. (C) 2012 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by

Abstract = {{A comparison of snow depths on sea ice was made using airborne
   altimeters and an Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E) simulator. The data were collected during the
   March 2006 National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Arctic
   field campaign utilizing the NASA P-3B aircraft. The campaign consisted
   of an initial series of coordinated surface and aircraft measurements
   over Elson Lagoon, Alaska and adjacent seas followed by a series of
   large-scale (100 km x 50 km) coordinated aircraft and AMSR-E snow depth
   measurements over portions of the Chukchi and Beaufort seas. This paper
   focuses on the latter part of the campaign. The P-3B aircraft carried
   the University of Colorado Polarimetric Scanning Radiometer (PSR-A), the
   NASA Wallops Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM) lidar altimeter, and the
   University of Kansas Delay-Doppler (D2P) radar altimeter. The PSR-A was
   used as an AMSR-E simulator, whereas the ATM and D2P altimeters were
   used in combination to provide an independent estimate of snow depth.
   Results of a comparison between the altimeter-derived snow depths and
   the equivalent AMSR-E snow depths using PSR-A brightness temperatures
   calibrated relative to AMSR-E are presented. Data collected over a
   frozen coastal polynya were used to intercalibrate the ATM and D2P
   altimeters before estimating an altimeter snow depth. Results show that
   the mean difference between the PSR and altimeter snow depths is -2.4 cm
   (PSR minus altimeter) with a standard deviation of 7.7 cm. The RMS
   difference is 8.0 cm. The overall correlation between the two snow depth
   data sets is 0.59.}},

Journal = {{OCEAN DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1201-1215}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The development of various volume penalization techniques for use in
   modeling topographical features in the ocean is the focus of this paper.
   Due to the complicated geometry inherent in ocean boundaries, the
   stair-step representation used in the majority of current global ocean
   circulation models causes accuracy and numerical stability problems.
   Brinkman penalization is the basis for the methods developed here and is
   a numerical technique used to enforce no-slip boundary conditions
   through the addition of a term to the governing equations. The second
   aspect to this proposed approach is that all governing equations are
   solved on a nonuniform, adaptive grid through the use of the adaptive
   wavelet collocation method. This method solves the governing equations
   on temporally and spatially varying meshes, which allows higher
   effective resolution to be obtained with less computational cost. When
   penalization methods are coupled with the adaptive wavelet collocation
   method, the flow near the boundary can be well-resolved. It is
   especially useful for simulations of boundary currents and tsunamis,
   where flow near the boundary is important. This paper will give a
   thorough analysis of these methods applied to the shallow water
   equations, as well as some preliminary work applying these methods to
   volume penalization for bathymetry representation for use in either the
   nonhydrostatic or hydrostatic primitive equations.}},

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROGRAMMING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{127-155}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for using varying sample sizes in
   batch-type optimization methods for large-scale machine learning
   problems. The first part of the paper deals with the delicate issue of
   dynamic sample selection in the evaluation of the function and gradient.
   We propose a criterion for increasing the sample size based on variance
   estimates obtained during the computation of a batch gradient. We
   establish an complexity bound on the total cost of a gradient method.
   The second part of the paper describes a practical Newton method that
   uses a smaller sample to compute Hessian vector-products than to
   evaluate the function and the gradient, and that also employs a dynamic
   sampling technique. The focus of the paper shifts in the third part of
   the paper to L (1)-regularized problems designed to produce sparse
   solutions. We propose a Newton-like method that consists of two phases:
   a (minimalistic) gradient projection phase that identifies zero
   variables, and subspace phase that applies a subsampled Hessian Newton
   iteration in the free variables. Numerical tests on speech recognition
   problems illustrate the performance of the algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that sodium nitrite treatment reverses large
   elastic artery stiffening in old mice via reductions in collagen I,
   increases in elastin and/or decreases in advanced glycation end products
   (AGEs) mediated by reduced oxidative stress. Aortic pulse wave velocity
   (aPWV), a measure of large elastic artery stiffness, was greater in old
   (26-28 months) compared with young (4-6 months) control animals (520 +/-
   9 vs. 405 +/- 6 cm/s, p<0.05), and this was reversed by 3 weeks of
   sodium nitrite treatment (50 mg/L) (435 +/- 17 cm/s). Age-related
   increases (p<0.05) in aortic superoxide production were associated with
   greater total and adventitial nitrotyrosine staining, all of which were
   reversed by nitrite treatment. Total and adventitial transforming growth
   factor beta and collagen I were increased, and total and medial elastin
   were reduced with aging (p<0.05), but were unaffected by sodium nitrite.
   Aorta from old mice had increased total, adventitial and medial AGEs
   (p<0.05 vs. young), which were normalized by sodium nitrite treatment.
   In aortic segments from young mice in vitro, pyrogallol (10 mu M), a
   superoxide generator, induced an ``aging-like{''} increase in AGEs, and
   direct treatment with AGEs induced vascular stiffening; these effects
   were prevented by incubation with sodium nitrite. De-stiffening of aged
   large elastic arteries by short-term sodium nitrite therapy is mediated
   in part by normalization of AGEs secondary to amelioration of oxidative
   stress. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cell-cell contact between pancreatic beta-cells is important for
   maintaining survival and normal insulin secretion. Various techniques
   have been developed to promote cell-cell contact between beta-cells, but
   a simple yet robust method that affords precise control over
   three-dimensional (3D) beta-cell cluster size has not been demonstrated.
   To address this need, we developed a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)
   hydrogel microwell platform using photolithography. This microwell
   cell-culture platform promotes the formation of 3D beta-cell aggregates
   of defined sizes from 25 to 210 mu m in diameter. Using this platform,
   mouse insulinoma 6 (MIN6) beta-cells formed aggregates with cell-cell
   adherin junctions. These naturally formed cell aggregates with
   controllable sizes can be removed from the microwells for
   macroencapsulation, implantation, or other biological assays. When
   removed and subsequently encapsulated in PEG hydrogels, the aggregated
   cell clusters demonstrated improved cellular viability (>90\%) over 7
   days in culture, while the beta-cells encapsulated as single cells
   maintained only 20\% viability. Aggregated MIN6 cells also exhibited
   more than fourfold higher insulin secretion in response to a glucose
   challenge compared with encapsulated single beta-cells. Further, the
   cell aggregates stained positively for E-cadherin, indicative of the
   formation of cell junctions. Using this hydrogel microwell cell-culture
   method, viable and functional beta-cell aggregates of specific sizes
   were created, providing a platform from which other biologically
   relevant questions may be answered.}},

Abstract = {{We tested the hypothesis that foreign particles shed from filters can
   accelerate the rate of protein aggregation and particle formation during
   agitation stress. Various types and brands of syringe filters were
   tested. Particle counts and size distribution (=1 mu m) in buffer alone
   or in solutions of keratinocyte growth factor 2 (KGF-2) were determined
   with a micro-flow imaging. Submicron particle populations were
   characterized by dynamic light scattering. Loss of soluble protein
   during filtration or postfiltration incubation was determined by
   ultraviolet spectroscopy and bicinchoninic acid protein assay. There was
   a wide range (from essentially none to >100,000/mL) in the counts for at
   least 1 mu m particles shed into buffer or KGF-2 solution from the
   different syringe filters (with or without borosilicate glass
   microfibers). Filtration of KGF-2 with units containing glass
   microfibers above the membrane resulted in 20\%-80\% loss of protein due
   to adsorption to filter components. Filtration with systems containing a
   membrane alone resulted in 0\%-20\% loss of KGF-2. Effects of 24-h
   postfiltration incubation were tested on KGF-2 solution filtered with
   polyether sulfone membrane filters. Loss of soluble protein and
   formation of particles during agitation were much greater than that in
   control, unfiltered KGF-2 solutions. Similar acceleration of protein
   aggregation and particle formation was observed when unfiltered KGF-2
   solution was mixed with filtered buffer and agitated. Particle shedding
   from syringe filtersand the resulting acceleration of protein
   aggregation during agitationvaried greatly among the different syringe
   filters and individual units of a given filter type. Our results
   demonstrate that nanoparticles and microparticles shed from the filters
   can accelerate protein aggregation and particle formation, especially
   during agitation. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There is a growing need to site new power generating plants that use
   cleaner energy sources due to increased regulations on air and water
   pollution and a sociopolitical desire to develop more clean energy
   sources. To assist utility and energy companies as well as policy-makers
   in evaluating potential areas for siting new plants in the contiguous
   United States, an adaptation of a geographic information system
   (GIS)-based multicriteria decision analysis approach is presented in
   this paper. The presented approach has led to the development of the Oak
   Ridge Siting Analysis for power Generation Expansion (OR-SAGE) tool. The
   tool takes inputs such as population growth, water availability,
   environmental indicators, and tectonic and geological hazards to provide
   an in-depth analysis for siting options. To the utility and energy
   companies, the tool can quickly and effectively provide feedback on land
   suitability based on technology specific inputs. However, the tool does
   not replace the required detailed evaluation of candidate sites. To the
   policy-makers, the tool provides the ability to analyze the impacts of
   future energy technology while balancing competing resource use.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},

Abstract = {{Nanowire arrays present an excellent candidate for high performance
   lithium-ion battery electrodes. However, agglomeration in long nanowire
   arrays impedes nanowire-based electrodes from delivering high areal
   capacity, by degrading the nanoscale wires to micro-sized bundles and
   reducing the mechanical stability. In this study, we develop a simple
   way to fabricate three-dimensional (3D) nickel-tin (Ni-Sn) nanowire
   networks by using 3D porous anodic alumina templates synthesized from
   low-cost impure aluminum foils. By eliminating agglomeration, stable
   high areal capacity anodes are demonstrated with 3D self-supporting
   Ni-Sn nanowire network structures. With a nanowire length of 40 mu m,
   the 3D Ni-Sn nanowire networks can deliver an areal capacity as high as
   4.3 mAh cm(-2) with a cycle life longer than 50 cycles. The 3D Ni-Sn
   nanowire networks also exhibit an excellent rate capability with 72\% of
   the capacity retained when the test rate increases from C/5 to 6C. (C)

Abstract = {{Flash-sintering is invariably accompanied by a highly non-linear rise in
   the specimen's conductivity. Thus the specimen temperature rises above
   the furnace temperature. It is shown that flash-sintering is a transient
   phenomenon, where the power dissipation rises quickly at first, but then
   declines towards a steady state, as the power supply switches from
   voltage to current control. The area under the power spike, which is
   equal to the Joules expended in the sample during the transient, is
   absorbed by the heat capacity of the specimen. Therefore, the specimen
   temperature rises gradually towards this steady state through the
   transient. Whereas the power spike can exceed a peak value of 1000 mW
   mm(-3), the dissipation during the current controlled regime is in the
   100-400 mW mm(-3) range. The extrapolation of sintering time from a few
   hours, as in conventional sintering, to a few seconds, using the
   activation energy for diffusion, predicts sample temperatures that are
   far in excess of the measured specimen temperature during flash
   sintering. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A technique to measure spatially resolved permeances through tubular
   membranes with a moveable mass spectrometer probe at the membrane
   surface is described. This technique was used to determine spatial
   permeance distributions for SAPO-34 zeolite membranes, alumina membrane
   supports, and a Vycor glass membrane. The distribution of local
   permeances provides more detailed information about membrane properties
   than global permeances. The CO2 and CH4 permeances of SAPO-34 membranes
   that had high permeances and selectivities at 4.6 MPa were not spatially
   uniform across the membrane area. Membranes prepared using Al(OH)(3) as
   the aluminum precursor had large regions that were nearly impermeable,
   whereas membranes prepared with Al(i-C3H7O)(3) were more uniform, and
   thus had higher overall permeances. Scanning electron micrographs
   indicated that these differences in permeance were not due to
   differences in membrane thickness, and spatially uniform permeance
   distributions for alumina supports suggest that they were not due to
   non-uniformities in the supports. Defect locations in the SAPO-34 layers
   were detected using i-butane permeation, because i-butane is too large
   to enter the SAPO-34 pores, and the defect concentrations were low.
   These spatially resolved measurements indicate the potential to increase
   both CO2/CH4 selectivity and CO2 permeance, and help understand the
   factors that affect membranes properties. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper presents an approach to efficiency optimization in digitally

   conditions. Efficiency is characterized and optimized based on power
   loss modeling and multivariable nonlinear constrained optimization over

   adopted to reduce MOSFET turn-on switching loss in discontinuous
   conduction mode. An optimization procedure is formulated to minimize
   power loss weighted over a range of operating points, under a cost
   constraint. A lookup table-based digital controller is applied to
   achieve on-line efficiency optimization by programming switching
   frequencies and operating modes based on the efficiency optimization
   processes. The proposed on-line efficiency optimization approach is
   verified by experimental results on a low cost 65 W flyback dc-dc

Abstract = {{Current-mode control in digitally controlled switched-mode power
   supplies typically requires analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion of at
   least two signals, voltage, and current. The complexity of voltage A/D
   converters can be reduced using window A/D techniques. In conventional
   current A/D conversion, however, relatively high resolution is required
   over a wide range of signals, which results in increased complexity,
   power consumption, and cost of the controller. This paper proposes a
   very simple feedback sensor capable of high-resolution average inductor
   current sensing using two analog comparators and an analog low-pass
   filter. The approach requires very few external components and employs
   minimal digital hardware resources. A dynamic model and performance of
   the average inductor current sensor are experimentally verified on a
   12-V input, 19-V output, 50-W boost converter prototype. The
   applicability of the proposed sensor is demonstrated in a digitally
   controlled 400-W, 400-V output Boost power factor preregulator.}},

Title = {{Tailward leap of multiple expansions of the plasma sheet during a
   moderately intense substorm: THEMIS observations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{JUL 26}},
Abstract = {{A moderately intense substorm on 1 March 2008, from 0830 to 1000 UT,
   observed by THEMIS probes and the Ground Based Observatory (GBO) is
   examined to investigate the global evolution of substorm phenomena.
   During this interval, all five THEMIS probes are closely aligned along
   the tail axis near midnight covering a radial range from similar to 9 Re
   to similar to 18 Re. After the substorm onset, plasma sheet expansions
   take place successively at multiple locations in the magnetotail as
   measured by different probes. The positions of the plasma sheet
   expansions have a tailward leap progression with an average velocity of
   similar to 36 km/s. There are two types of dipolarization detected in
   this substorm. The first type is the dipolarization front which is
   associated with the bursty bulk flow (BBF). While the second type, which
   we call `global dipolarization', is associated with plasma sheet
   expansions. In the substorm studied, there are four intensifications as
   shown in the THEMIS AE index. We can detect the effects of localized and
   short-lived magnetic energy release processes occurring in the
   magnetotail corresponding to each of the four AE intensifications.
   Furthermore, the inner four probes can detect the global dipolarization
   signatures similar to 4-15 min earlier than plasma sheet expansions,
   while the outermost probe (P1) cannot detect this before the plasma
   sheet expansion. These two phenomena are caused by the same process
   (magnetic energy release process) but the effects detected by probes
   locally appear delayed. The observations in this case are not sufficient
   to distinguish between the two competing substorm models.}},

Abstract = {{To reduce shrinkage stress which arises during the polymerization of
   cross-linked polymers, allyl sulfide functional groups were incorporated
   into methacrylate polymerizations to determine their effect on stress
   relaxation via addition-fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT).
   Additionally, stoichiometrically balanced thiol and ally'
   sulfide-containing norbornene monomers were incorporated into the
   methacrylate resin to maximize the overall functional group conversion
   and promote AFCT while also enhancing the polymer's mechanical
   properties. Shrinkage stress and reaction kinetics for each of the
   various functional groups were measured by tensometry and
   Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, respectively. The glass
   transition temperature (T-g) and elastic moduli (E') were measured using
   dynamic mechanical analysis. When the ally' sulfide functional group was
   incorporated into dimethacrylates, the polymerization-induced shrinkage
   stress was not relieved as compared with analogous propyl
   sulfide-containing resins. These analogous propyl sulfide-containing
   monomers are incapable of undergoing AFCT while having similar chemical
   structure and cross-link density to the allyl sulfide-containing
   methacrylates. Here, a monomethacrylate monomer that also contains a
   cyclic ally] sulfide (PAS) was found to increase the cross-linking
   density nearly 20 times as compared to an analogous monomethacrylate in
   which the allyl sulfide was replaced with an ethyl sulfide. Despite the
   much higher cross-link density, the PAS formulation exhibited no
   concomitant increase in stress. Thiol norbornene resins were
   copolymerized in PAS to promote AFCT as well as to synergistically
   combine the ring-opening benefits associated with the thiol ene
   reaction. AFCT resulted in a 63\% reduction of polymerization stress and
   a 45 degrees C enhancement of the glass transition temperature in the
   allyl sulfide-containing thiol- norbornene-methacrylate system compared
   with rubbery dimethacrylates. When compared with conventional glassy
   dimethacrylates, this combined system has less than 10\% of the typical
   shrinkage stress level while having similarly excellent mechanical
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{Since polymerization-induced shrinkage stress is detrimental in many
   applications, addition fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) was employed
   to induce network relaxation and adaptation that mitigate the shrinkage
   stress. Here, to form high glass transition temperature, high modulus
   polymers while still minimizing stress, multifunctional methacrylate
   monomers were incorporated into allyl sulfide-containing thiol-yne
   resins to provide simultaneously high glass transition temperatures and
   a facile mechanism for AFCT throughout the network. As a negative
   control, in an attempt to isolate just the effects of AFCT in the
   polymerization, a propyl sulfide-based diyne, which has a nearly
   identical chemical structure though absent any AFCT-capable functional
   group, was synthesized and implemented in place of the allyl
   sulfide-based diyne. The glass transition temperature of the ternary
   systems increased from 39 to 79 degrees C as the methacrylate content
   increased while the shrinkage stress of the optimal ternary resin was
   lower than either the binary thiol-yne resin or the pure methacrylate
   resin. The stress relaxation benefit associated with AFCT increased with
   increasing allyl sulfide concentration as shown by a decrease in the
   relative stress from 0.98 to 0.53. The allyl sulfide-based
   thiol-yne-methacrylate system exhibits stress relaxation up to 55\% and
   increased T-g up to 40 degrees C compared with the control,
   AFCT-incapable thiol-yne. This ternary system has less than 1/3 of the
   stress of conventional dimethacrylate monomer resins while possessing
   similarly outstanding mechanical behavior.}},

Title = {{The impact of helium on thermosphere mass density response to
   geomagnetic activity during the recent solar minimum}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-SPACE PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{High-resolution mass density observations inferred from accelerometer
   measurements on the CHAMP and GRACE satellites are employed to
   investigate the thermosphere mass density response with latitude and
   altitude to geomagnetic activity during the recent solar minimum.
   Coplanar orbital periods in February 2007 and December 2008 revealed the
   altitude and latitude response in thermosphere mass density for their
   respective winter hemispheres was influenced by the relative amount of
   helium and oxygen present. The CHAMP-to-GRACE (C/G) mass density ratio
   depends on two terms; the first proportional to the ratio of the mean
   molecular weight to temperature and the second proportional to the
   vertical gradient of the logarithmic mean molecular weight. For the
   relative levels of helium and oxygen in February 2007, the winter
   hemisphere C/G mass density response to geomagnetic activity, although
   similar to the summer hemisphere, was caused predominantly by changes in
   the vertical gradient of the logarithmic mean molecular weight. In
   December 2008, the significant presence of helium caused the mean
   molecular weight changes to exceed temperature changes in the winter
   hemisphere leading to an increase in the C/G ratio with increasing
   geomagnetic activity, in opposition to the decrease observed in the
   summer hemisphere that was caused primarily by temperature changes. The
   observed behavior is indicative of composition effects influencing the
   mass density response and the dynamic action of the oxygen to helium
   transition region in both latitude and altitude will lead to complex
   behaviors in the mass density at GRACE altitudes throughout the extended
   solar minimum from 2007 to 2010.}},

Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{This biennial Review summarizes much of particle physics. Using data
   from previous editions, plus 2658 new measurements from 644 papers, we
   list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons,
   leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for
   hypothetical particles such as Higgs bosons, heavy neutrinos, and
   supersymmetric particles. All the particle properties and search limits
   are listed in Summary Tables. We also give numerous tables, figures,
   formulae, and reviews of topics such as the Standard Model, particle
   detectors, probability, and statistics. Among the 112 reviews are many
   that are new or heavily revised including those on Heavy-Quark and
   Soft-Collinear Effective Theory, Neutrino Cross Section Measurements,
   Monte Carlo Event Generators, Lattice QCD, Heavy Quarkonium
   Spectroscopy, Top Quark, Dark Matter, V-cb \& V-ub, Quantum
   Chromodynamics, High-Energy Collider Parameters, Astrophysical
   Constants, Cosmological Parameters, and Dark Matter.
   A booklet is available containing the Summary Tables and abbreviated
   versions of some of the other sections of this full Review. All tables,
   listings, and reviews (and errata) are also available on the Particle
   Data Group website: http://pdg.lbl.gov.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal cross-correlation function of the angle-of-arrival (AOA)
   fluctuations of two optical waves propagating through atmospheric
   turbulence carries information regarding the average wind velocity
   transverse to the propagation path. We present and discuss two
   estimators for the retrieval of the path-averaged beam-transverse
   horizontal wind velocity, v(t). Both methods retrieve v(t) from the
   temporal cross-correlation function of AOA fluctuations obtained from
   two closely spaced light-emitting diodes (LEDs). The first method relies
   on the time delay of the peak (TDP) of the cross-correlation function,
   and the second method exploits its slope at zero lag (SZL). Over a 9 h
   period during which v(t) varied between -1.3 ms(-1) and 2.0 ms(-1), the
   maximum rms difference between optically retrieved and in situ measured
   10 s estimates of v(t) was found to be 0.18 ms(-1) for the TDP estimator
   and 0.23 ms(-1) for the SZL estimator. Applicability and limitations of
   these two optical wind retrieval techniques are discussed. (C) 2012

Title = {{A NEW LOW MAGNETIC FIELD MAGNETAR: THE 2011 OUTBURST OF SWIFT

Abstract = {{We report on the long-term X-ray monitoring with Swift, RXTE, Suzaku,
   Chandra, and XMM-Newton of the outburst of the newly discovered magnetar
   Swift J1822.3-1606 (SGR 1822-1606), from the first observations soon
   after the detection of the short X-ray bursts which led to its
   discovery, through the first stages of its outburst decay (covering the
   time span from 2011 July until the end of 2012 April). We also report on
   archival ROSAT observations which detected the source during its likely
   quiescent state, and on upper limits on Swift J1822.3-1606's
   radio-pulsed and optical emission during outburst, with the Green Bank
   Telescope and the Gran Telescopio Canarias, respectively. Our X-ray
   timing analysis finds the source rotating with a period of P =
   8.43772016(2)s and a period derivative (P) over dot = 8.3(2) x10(-14) s
   s(-1), which implies an inferred dipolar surface magnetic field of B
   similar or equal to 2.7x10(13) G at the equator. This measurement makes
   Swift J1822.3-1606 the second lowest magnetic field magnetar (after SGR
   0418+5729). Following the flux and spectral evolution from the beginning
   of the outburst, we find that the flux decreased by about an order of
   magnitude, with a subtle softening of the spectrum, both typical of the
   outburst decay of magnetars. By modeling the secular thermal evolution
   of Swift J1822.3-1606, we find that the observed timing properties of
   the source, as well as its quiescent X-ray luminosity, can be reproduced
   if it was born with a poloidal and crustal toroidal fields of B-p
   similar to 1.5x10(14) G and B-tor similar to 7x10(14) G, respectively,
   and if its current age is similar to 550 kyr.}},

Abstract = {{Accurately simulating gross primary productivity (GPP) in terrestrial
   ecosystem models is critical because errors in simulated GPP propagate
   through the model to introduce additional errors in simulated biomass
   and other fluxes. We evaluated simulated, daily average GPP from 26
   models against estimated GPP at 39 eddy covariance flux tower sites
   across the United States and Canada. None of the models in this study
   match estimated GPP within observed uncertainty. On average, models
   overestimate GPP in winter, spring, and fall, and underestimate GPP in
   summer. Models overpredicted GPP under dry conditions and for
   temperatures below 0 degrees C. Improvements in simulated soil moisture
   and ecosystem response to drought or humidity stress will improve
   simulated GPP under dry conditions. Adding a low-temperature response to
   shut down GPP for temperatures below 0 degrees C will reduce the
   positive bias in winter, spring, and fall and improve simulated
   phenology. The negative bias in summer and poor overall performance
   resulted from mismatches between simulated and observed light use
   efficiency (LUE). Improving simulated GPP requires better leaf-to-canopy
   scaling and better values of model parameters that control the maximum
   potential GPP, such as epsilon(max) (LUE), V-cmax (unstressed Rubisco
   catalytic capacity) or Jmax (the maximum electron transport rate).}},

Abstract = {{A millimetre-wave diplexer is demonstrated using two singly terminated
   bandpass filters fabricated using surface micromachined
   rectangular-coaxial transmission lines. Modified seventh order Chebyshev
   bandpass filters with 0.1 dB passband ripple are designed to operate
   from 50 to 75 GHz and from 75 to 110 GHz. These two filters are simply
   combined using a common junction to form a contiguous 50-75 GHz and
   75-110 GHz diplexer. The singly terminated filter values are adjusted by
   use of a common factor that modifies the admittance properties of the
   filter to facilitate their parallel combination. The two filters and
   their diplexer combination are fabricated and the measurements are
   compared favourably to the theoretical models.}},

Title = {{Redirecting Valvular Myofibroblasts into Dormant Fibroblasts through
   Light-mediated Reduction in Substrate Modulus}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 13}},
Abstract = {{Fibroblasts residing in connective tissues throughout the body are
   responsible for extracellular matrix (ECM) homeostasis and repair. In
   response to tissue damage, they activate to become myofibroblasts, which
   have organized contractile cytoskeletons and produce a myriad of
   proteins for ECM remodeling. However, persistence of myofibroblasts can
   lead to fibrosis with excessive collagen deposition and tissue
   stiffening. Thus, understanding which signals regulate de-activation of
   myofibroblasts during normal tissue repair is critical. Substrate
   modulus has recently been shown to regulate fibrogenic properties,
   proliferation and apoptosis of fibroblasts isolated from different
   organs. However, few studies track the cellular responses of fibroblasts
   to dynamic changes in the microenvironmental modulus. Here, we utilized
   a light-responsive hydrogel system to probe the fate of valvular
   myofibroblasts when the Young's modulus of the substrate was reduced
   from similar to 32 kPa, mimicking pre-calcified diseased tissue, to
   similar to 7 kPa, mimicking healthy cardiac valve fibrosa. After
   softening the substrata, valvular myofibroblasts de-activated with
   decreases in alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) stress fibers and
   proliferation, indicating a dormant fibroblast state. Gene signatures of
   myofibroblasts (including alpha-SMA and connective tissue growth factor
   (CTGF)) were significantly down-regulated to fibroblast levels within 6
   hours of in situ substrate elasticity reduction while a general
   fibroblast gene vimentin was not changed. Additionally, the de-activated
   fibroblasts were in a reversible state and could be re-activated to
   enter cell cycle by growth stimulation and to express fibrogenic genes,
   such as CTGF, collagen 1A1 and fibronectin 1, in response to TGF-beta 1.
   Our data suggest that lowering substrate modulus can serve as a cue to
   down-regulate the valvular myofibroblast phenotype resulting in a
   predominantly quiescent fibroblast population. These results provide
   insight in designing hydrogel substrates with physiologically relevant
   stiffness to dynamically redirect cell fate in vitro.}},

Abstract = {{We compare and examine diurnal temperature tides including their

   using data from Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere-Energetics and
   Dynamics/Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry
   (TIMED/SABER) and from six different reanalysis data sets: (1) the
   Modern Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA),
   (2) the European Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
   reanalysis (ERA-Interim) (3) the National Centers for Environmental

   reanalysis (NCEP1), and (6) the NCEP and Department of Energy (DOE)
   Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP-II) reanalysis data
   (NCEP2). The horizontal and vertical structures of the diurnal tides in
   SABER and reanalyses reasonably agree, although the amplitudes are up to
   30-50\% smaller in the reanalyses than in the SABER in the upper
   stratosphere to lower mesosphere. Of all tidal components, the DW1 is
   dominant while a clear eastward propagating zonal wave number 3
   component (DE3) is observed at midlatitudes of the Southern Hemisphere
   in winter. Among the six reanalyses, MERRA, ERA-Interim and CFSR are
   better at reproducing realistic diurnal tides. It is found that the
   diurnal tides extracted from SABER data in the winter-hemisphere
   stratosphere suffer from sampling issues that are caused by short-term
   variations of the background temperature. In addition, the GSWM
   underestimates the amplitude in the midlatitude upper stratosphere by
   about 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{lmidazolium- and oligo(imidazolium)-based ionic organic compounds are

   thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analysis and column chromatography
   separation of imidazolium-based ionic compounds is presented.
   Normal-phase ion-pair TLC is used to effectively analyze homologous
   mixtures of these ionic compounds. Subsequent separation of the mixtures
   is performed using ion-pair flash chromatography on normal-phase silica
   gel, yielding high levels of recovery. This method also results in a
   complete exchange of the counter anion on the imidazolium compounds to
   the anion of the ion-pair reagent. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Plume spreading in groundwater by stretching and folding}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new approach to the hydraulics of in situ
   groundwater remediation. In situ remediation promotes reactions between
   an injected treatment solution and the contaminated groundwater, but
   without a hydraulic mechanism to promote spreading, the laminar flows
   characteristic of porous media will keep the two fluids in approximately
   the same relative configuration as they travel through the aquifer,
   limiting the opportunity for reactions to occur. To address this
   fundamental limitation, this paper borrows a key result from the fluid
   mechanics literature : Spreading in laminar flows is optimized by
   chaotic advection. Previous studies have applied this result to
   groundwater remediation using the pulsed dipole model, but that model
   depends on reinjection of fluid, which presents a number of theoretical
   and practical limitations. Accordingly, this paper proposes a new
   conceptual model for plume spreading by chaotic advection, using an
   engineered sequence of extractions and injections of clean water at an
   array of wells, which generates plume spreading by stretching and
   folding the fluid interface between the injected treatment solution and
   the contaminated groundwater but does not require reinjection. The paper
   includes an overview of the analytical techniques-Poincare sections,
   periodic points, stable and unstable manifolds, heteroclinic points, and
   Lyapunov exponents-used to demonstrate chaotic advection in the limiting
   case in which diffusion is negligible. Numerical simulations show that
   spreading by stretching and folding is complimentary to spreading
   resulting from aquifer heterogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale climate patterns influenced temperature and weather patterns
   around the globe in 2011. In particular, a moderate-to-strong La Nina at
   the beginning of the year dissipated during boreal spring but reemerged
   during fall. The phenomenon contributed to historical droughts in East
   Africa, the southern United States, and northern Mexico, as well the
   wettest two-year period (2010-11) on record for Australia, particularly
   remarkable as this follows a decade-long dry period. Precipitation
   patterns in South America were also influenced by La Nina. Heavy rain in
   Rio de Janeiro in January triggered the country's worst floods and
   landslides in Brazil's history.
   The 2011 combined average temperature across global land and ocean
   surfaces was the coolest since 2008, but was also among the 15 warmest
   years on record and above the 1981-2010 average. The global sea surface
   temperature cooled by 0.1 degrees C from 2010 to 2011, associated with
   cooling influences of La Nina. Global integrals of upper ocean heat
   content for 2011 were higher than for all prior years, demonstrating the
   Earth's dominant role of the oceans in the Earth's energy budget. In the
   upper atmosphere, tropical stratospheric temperatures were anomalously
   warm, while polar temperatures were anomalously cold. This led to large
   springtime stratospheric ozone reductions in polar latitudes in both
   hemispheres. Ozone concentrations in the Arctic stratosphere during
   March were the lowest for that period since satellite records began in
   1979. An extensive, deep, and persistent ozone hole over the Antarctic
   in September indicates that the recovery to pre-1980 conditions is
   proceeding very slowly.
   Atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations increased by 2.10 ppm in 2011,
   and exceeded 390 ppm for the first time since instrumental records
   began. Other greenhouse gases also continued to rise in concentration
   and the combined effect now represents a 30\% increase in radiative
   forcing over a 1990 baseline. Most ozone depleting substances continued
   to fall. The global net ocean carbon dioxide uptake for the 2010
   transition period from El Nino to La Nina, the most recent period for
   which analyzed data are available, was estimated to be 1.30 Pg C yr(-1),
   almost 12\% below the 29-year long-term average.
   Relative to the long-term trend, global sea level dropped noticeably in
   mid-2010 and reached a local minimum in 2011. The drop has been linked
   to the La Nina conditions that prevailed throughout much of 2010-11.
   Global sea level increased sharply during the second half of 2011.
   Global tropical cyclone activity during 2011 was well-below average,
   with a total of 74 storms compared with the 1981-2010 average of 89.
   Similar to 2010, the North Atlantic was the only basin that experienced
   above-normal activity. For the first year since the widespread
   introduction of the Dvorak intensity-estimation method in the 1980s,
   only three tropical cyclones reached Category 5 intensity level-all in
   the Northwest Pacific basin.
   The Arctic continued to warm at about twice the rate compared with lower
   latitudes. Below-normal summer snowfall, a decreasing trend in surface
   albedo, and above-average surface and upper air temperatures resulted in
   a continued pattern of extreme surface melting, and net snow and ice
   loss on the Greenland ice sheet. Warmer-than-normal temperatures over
   the Eurasian Arctic in spring resulted in a new record-low June snow
   cover extent and spring snow cover duration in this region. In the
   Canadian Arctic, the mass loss from glaciers and ice caps was the
   greatest since GRACE measurements began in 2002, continuing a negative
   trend that began in 1987. New record high temperatures occurred at 20 m
   below the land surface at all permafrost observatories on the North
   Slope of Alaska, where measurements began in the late 1970s. Arctic sea
   ice extent in September 2011 was the second-lowest on record, while the
   extent of old ice (four and five years) reached a new record minimum
   that was just 19\% of normal.
   On the opposite pole, austral winter and spring temperatures were more
   than 3 degrees C above normal over much of the Antarctic continent.
   However, winter temperatures were below normal in the northern Antarctic
   Peninsula, which continued the downward trend there during the last 15
   years. In summer, an all-time record high temperature of -12.3 degrees C
   was set at the South Pole station on 25 December, exceeding the previous
   record by more than a full degree. Antarctic sea ice extent anomalies
   increased steadily through much of the year, from briefly setting a
   record low in April, to well above average in December. The latter trend
   reflects the dispersive effects of low pressure on sea ice and the
   generally cool conditions around the Antarctic perimeter.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines 1,029 snow-induced building failure incidents in the
   United States between 1989 and 2009 and 91 international incidents
   between 1979 and 2009. Incidents were identified through newspaper
   archives, including 1,345 articles from 883 unique sources. Most U. S.
   incidents occurred in New York, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts.
   Findings show that 37\% of all buildings experiencing snow-induced
   failure incidents in the United States were of metal/steel construction
   and another 37\% were of timber, while 53\% of international incidents
   were metal/steel and 17\% were concrete. Warehouses, factories, and
   commercial buildings were the most common buildings affected. Failures
   were attributed to the amount of snow, rain-on-snow mixes, and building
   problems. Monetary impacts included building damages ranging between
   \$1,000 and \$200 million and business interruption associated with an
   average building closure of four months. Nineteen fatalities and 146
   injuries were reported for the United States, while 293 fatalities and
   586 injuries were reported internationally. These findings describe
   building failure trends, which may be significant, considering potential
   impacts of accelerating global climate change on the patterns of
   snowfall frequency and density. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)CF.1943-5509.0000222.

Abstract = {{An innovative flood-prediction framework is developed using Tropical
   Rainfall Measuring Mission precipitation forcing and a proxy for river
   discharge from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E) onboard the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration's Aqua satellite. The AMSR-E-detected water surface
   signal was correlated with in situ measurements of streamflow in the
   Okavango Basin in Southern Africa as indicated by a Pearson correlation
   coefficient of 0.90. A distributed hydrologic model, with structural
   data sets derived from remote-sensing data, was calibrated to yield
   simulations matching the flood frequencies from the AMSR-E-detected
   water surface signal. Model performance during a validation period
   yielded a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of 0.84. We concluded that
   remote-sensing data from microwave sensors could be used to supplement
   stream gauges in large sparsely gauged or ungauged basins to calibrate
   hydrologic models. Given the global availability of all required data
   sets, this approach can be potentially expanded to improve flood
   monitoring and prediction in sparsely gauged basins throughout the

Title = {{Intermittency in premixed turbulent reacting flows}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Intermittency in premixed reacting flows is studied using numerical
   simulations of premixed flames at a range of turbulence intensities. The
   flames are modeled using a simplified reaction mechanism that represents
   a stoichiometric H-2-air mixture. Intermittency is associated with high
   probabilities of large fluctuations in flow quantities, and these
   fluctuations can have substantial effects on the evolution and structure
   of premixed flames. Intermittency is characterized here using
   probability density functions (pdfs) and moments of the local enstrophy,
   pseudo-dissipation rate (strain rate magnitude), and scalar (reactant
   mass fraction) dissipation rate. Simulations of homogeneous isotropic
   turbulence with a nonreacting passive scalar are also carried out in
   order to provide a baseline for analyzing the reacting flow results. In
   the reacting flow simulations, conditional analyses based on local,
   instantaneous values of the scalar are used to study variations in the
   pdfs, moments, and intermittency through the flame. For low intensities,
   pdfs of the local enstrophy vary substantially through the flame, with
   greater intermittency near the products. Changes in the
   pseudo-dissipation pdfs are, however, less pronounced. As the intensity
   increases, both the enstrophy and pseudo-dissipation pdfs become
   increasingly independent of position in the flame and are similar to
   results from the nonreacting simulations. The scalar dissipation
   intermittency is largest near the reactants and increases at all flame
   locations with increasing turbulence intensity. For low intensities and
   in the reaction zone, however, scalar dissipation pdfs approximately
   follow a Gaussian distribution, indicative of substantially reduced
   intermittency. Deviations from log-normality are observed in the pdfs of
   all quantities, even for intensities and flame locations characterized
   by strong intermittency. The implications of these results for the
   internal structure of the flame are discussed, and we also propose a
   connection between reacting flow intermittency and anisotropic vorticity
   suppression by the flame. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This article surveys efforts on text mining of the pharmacogenomics
   literature, mainly from the period 2008 to 2011. Pharmacogenomics (or
   pharmacogenetics) is the field that studies how human genetic variation
   impacts drug response. Therefore, publications span the intersection of
   research in genotypes, phenotypes and pharmacology, a topic that has
   increasingly become a focus of active research in recent years. This
   survey covers efforts dealing with the automatic recognition of relevant
   named entities (e.g. genes, gene variants and proteins, diseases and
   other pathological phenomena, drugs and other chemicals relevant for
   medical treatment), as well as various forms of relations between them.
   A wide range of text genres is considered, such as scientific
   publications (abstracts, as well as full texts), patent texts and
   clinical narratives. We also discuss infrastructure and resources needed
   for advanced text analytics, e.g. document corpora annotated with
   corresponding semantic metadata (gold standards and training data),
   biomedical terminologies and ontologies providing domain-specific
   background knowledge at different levels of formality and specificity,
   software architectures for building complex and scalable text analytics
   pipelines and Web services grounded to them, as well as comprehensive
   ways to disseminate and interact with the typically huge amounts of
   semiformal knowledge structures extracted by text mining tools. Finally,
   we consider some of the novel applications that have already been
   developed in the field of pharmacogenomic text mining and point out
   perspectives for future research.}},

Abstract = {{A technological milestone for experiments employing transition edge
   sensor bolometers operating at sub-Kelvin temperature is the deployment
   of detector arrays with 100s-1000s of bolometers. One key technology for
   such arrays is readout multiplexing: the ability to read out many
   sensors simultaneously on the same set of wires. This paper describes a
   frequency-domain multiplexed readout system which has been developed for
   and deployed on the APEX-SZ and South Pole Telescope millimeter
   wavelength receivers. In this system, the detector array is divided into
   modules of seven detectors, and each bolometer within the module is
   biased with a unique similar to MHz sinusoidal carrier such that the
   individual bolometer signals are well separated in frequency space. The
   currents from all bolometers in a module are summed together and
   pre-amplified with superconducting quantum interference devices
   operating at 4 K. Room temperature electronics demodulate the carriers
   to recover the bolometer signals, which are digitized separately and
   stored to disk. This readout system contributes little noise relative to
   the detectors themselves, is remarkably insensitive to unwanted
   microphonic excitations, and provides a technology pathway to
   multiplexing larger numbers of sensors. (C) 2012 American Institute of
