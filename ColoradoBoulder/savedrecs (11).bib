Abstract = {{We use continuous measurements of GPS sites from across the Rio Grande
   Rift, Great Plains, and Colorado Plateau to estimate present-day surface
   velocities and strain rates. Velocity gradients from five east-west
   profiles suggest an average of similar to 1.2 nanostrains/yr east-west
   extensional strain rate across these three physiographic provinces. The
   extensional deformation is not concentrated in a narrow zone centered on
   the Rio Grande Rift but rather is distributed broadly from the western
   edge of the Colorado Plateau well into the western Great Plains. This
   unexpected pattern of broadly distributed deformation at the surface has
   important implications for our understanding of how low strain-rate
   deformation within continental interiors is accommodated.}},

Abstract = {{Taxonomic classification of the thousands-millions of 16S rRNA gene
   sequences generated in microbiome studies is often achieved using a
   naive Bayesian classifier (for example, the Ribosomal Database Project
   II (RDP) classifier), due to favorable trade-offs among automation,
   speed and accuracy. The resulting classification depends on the
   reference sequences and taxonomic hierarchy used to train the model;
   although the influence of primer sets and classification algorithms have
   been explored in detail, the influence of training set has not been
   characterized. We compared classification results obtained using three
   different publicly available databases as training sets, applied to five
   different bacterial 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing data sets generated
   (from human body, mouse gut, python gut, soil and anaerobic digester
   samples). We observed numerous advantages to using the largest, most
   diverse training set available, that we constructed from the Greengenes
   (GG) bacterial/archaeal 16S rRNA gene sequence database and the latest
   GG taxonomy. Phylogenetic clusters of previously unclassified
   experimental sequences were identified with notable improvements (for
   example, 50\% reduction in reads unclassified at the phylum level in
   mouse gut, soil and anaerobic digester samples), especially for
   phylotypes belonging to specific phyla (Tenericutes, Chloroflexi,
   Synergistetes and Candidate phyla TM6, TM7). Trimming the reference
   sequences to the primer region resulted in systematic improvements in
   classification depth, and greatest gains at higher confidence
   thresholds. Phylotypes unclassified at the genus level represented a
   greater proportion of the total community variation than classified
   operational taxonomic units in mouse gut and anaerobic digester samples,
   underscoring the need for greater diversity in existing reference
   databases. The ISME Journal (2012) 6, 94-103; doi:10.1038/ismej.2011.82;

Abstract = {{Band gaps appear in the frequency spectra of periodic materials and
   structures. In this work we examine flexural wave propagation in beams
   and investigate the effects of the various types and properties of
   periodicity on the frequency band structure, especially the location and
   width of band gaps. We consider periodicities involving the repeated
   spatial variation of material, geometry, boundary and/or suspended mass
   along the span of a beam. In our formulation, we implement Bloch's
   theorem for elastic wave propagation and utilize Timoshenko beam theory
   for the kinematical description of the underlying flexural motion. For
   the calculation of the frequency band structure we use the transfer
   matrix method, derived here in generalized form to enable separate or
   combined consideration of the different types of periodicity. Our
   results provide band-gap maps as a function of the type and properties
   of periodicity, and as a prime focus we identify and mathematically
   characterize the condition for the transition between Bragg scattering
   and local resonance, each being a unique wave propagation mechanism, and
   show the effects of this transition on the lowest band gap. The analysis
   presented can be extended to multidimensional phononic crystals and

Abstract = {{For optical observations of Earth-orbiting objects, multiple
   observations must be combined to determine the orbit of the observed
   object. Whether two arbitrary tracks are of the same object, however, is
   generally unknown a priori, and solving this problem with traditional
   approaches requires iterative procedures that do not guarantee
   convergence. This paper proposes a technique of correlating multiple
   optical observations using highly constrained probability distributions
   in Poincare orbit element space. These distributions are divided into
   subregions, each of which are mapped linearly, to reduce computational
   burden, but without significantly losing accuracy. A proof-of-concept
   implementation, in which simulated observations were processed,
   performed well. The technique proposed serves as a solution technique
   for initial orbit determination given two precise optical observation
   tracks.}},

   the attitude of the tether satellite remains constant on average, and it

Volume = {{81}},

Abstract = {{One of the challenges of treating patients with glomerulonephritis is to
   accurately assess disease activity. As renal biopsies are routinely
   stained for deposits of C3 activation fragments and glomerular C3
   deposits are found in most forms of glomerulonephritis, we sought to
   determine whether a relatively noninvasive measure of C3 fragment
   deposition in the kidney can serve as a good biomarker of disease onset
   and severity. We recently developed a magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI)-based method of detecting glomerular C3 and used this to track the
   progression of renal disease in the MRL/lpr mouse model of lupus
   nephritis using superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles conjugated to
   complement receptor type 2 as a targeting agent. Quantitative
   immunofluorescence showed that glomerular C3b/iC3b/C3d deposition
   progressively increased with disease activity, a finding replicated by
   the T2-weighted MRI. The T2 relaxation times decreased with disease
   activity in the cortex and medulla of the MRL/lpr but not in MRL/Mpj
   control mice. Thus, MRI contrast agents targeted to glomerular C3
   fragments can be used to noninvasively monitor disease activity in
   glomerulonephritis. As therapeutic complement inhibitors are used in
   patients with renal disease, this method, should it become feasible in
   humans, may identify those likely to benefit from complement inhibition.

Abstract = {{It is often impractical to obtain global channel knowledge and conduct
   centralized optimization for wireless networks. We study distributed
   weighted sumrate maximization (WSRM) in general MIMO interference
   networks, named B-MAC interference networks. It is desirable to exploit
   the structure of the problem to design distributed algorithms with high
   performance and low signaling overhead. We recently unveiled a polite
   waterfilling (PWF) structure satisfied by all Pareto optimal inputs of
   important achievable regions of the B-MAC interference networks. The PWF
   offers an elegant method to decompose a network into multiple equivalent
   single user channels and thus, facilitates the design of distributed
   algorithms. Based on the PWF, we design efficient distributed algorithms
   which only need local channel knowledge and converge to a stationary
   point of the WSRM problem. For TDD networks, the duality inherited in
   PWF and the channel reciprocity are further exploited to reduce the
   signaling overhead. The proposed algorithms are shown by simulations to
   outperform the state-of-the-art.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we demonstrate the bulk self-alignment of gold nanorods
   (GNRs) dispersed in lyotropic nematic liquid crystals (LCs) with high
   optical absorption coefficient at the surface plasmon resonant
   wavelength. The polymer-coated GNRs which show spontaneous long-range
   orientational ordering along the director of LC host exhibit long-term
   stability as well as high concentration. External magnetic field and
   shearing allow for alignment and realignment of the orientation of gold
   nanorods by changing the director of the liquid crystal matrix. This
   results in a switchable polarization-sensitive surface plasmon resonance
   exhibiting stark differences from that of the same nanorods in isotropic
   fluids. The devise-scale bulk nanoparticle alignment may enable optical
   metamaterial mass production and control of surface plasmon resonance of
   nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{The final radiofrequency power amplifier (PA) of a radar transmitter
   module is a large factor in system efficiency. Typical radar transmitter
   signals are frequency-modulated with constant-amplitude pulse envelopes
   in order to optimize efficiency, resulting in spectral broadening and
   power radiated outside of the radar frequency band. This paper
   demonstrates a PA with a dynamic power supply which enables high
   efficiency while reducing the spectral emissions. The resonant
   pulse-shaping power supply generates a raised-cosine pulse envelope
   waveform with efficiency greater than 90\% and peak envelope power
   around 6 W. Measured results with a 2.14-GHz GaN power amplifier with an
   efficiency of 76\% at peak power demonstrate over 67\% transmitter

Abstract = {{We present a model-based approach to synthesizing insulin infusion pump
   usage parameters against varying meal scenarios and physiological
   conditions. Insulin infusion pumps are commonly used by type-1 diabetic
   patients to control their blood glucose levels. The amounts of insulin
   to be infused are calculated based on parameters such as
   insulin-to-carbohydrate ratios and correction factors that need to be
   calibrated carefully for each patient. Frequent and careful calibration
   of these parameters is essential for avoiding complications such as
   hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.
   In this paper, we propose to synthesize optimal parameters for meal
   bolus calculation starting from models of the patient's insulin-glucose
   regulatory system and the infusion pump. Various off-the-shelf global
   optimization techniques are used to search for parameter values that
   minimize a penalty function defined over the predicted glucose sensor
   readings. The penalty function ``rewards{''} glucose levels that lie
   within the prescribed ranges and ``penalizes{''} the occurrence of
   hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. We evaluate our approach using a model
   of the insulin-glucose regulatory system proposed by Dalla Man et al.
   Using this model, we compare various strategies for optimizing pump
   usage parameters for a virtual population of in-silico patients.}},

Abstract = {{At many Universities, architectural, civil, and environmental
   engineering have a significant amount of the curriculum in common. For
   example, at the University of Colorado Boulder (CU) all three programs
   share 32\% of the required course credits in common, with a minimum of
   an additional 12\% in common between Civil : Architectural and 10\% in
   common between Civil : Environmental. Further, the skills and knowledge
   desired for these engineers also have much in common. To explore the
   similarities and differences in these disciplines as perceived by
   students, a Body of Knowledge (BOK2) survey was distributed to senior
   students as part of the lifelong learning module in the three separate
   capstone design courses. Students were asked to rank the American
   Society of Civil Engineers' (ASCE) 24 BOK2 outcomes from most to least
   important to their future careers. Among students in all three majors,
   design and problem solving were by far the top ranked outcomes;
   communication and teamwork were ranked between 3 to 6 by all majors; and
   there was also consensus among the bottom rated items (public policy 22,
   social science 23, humanities 24). Outcomes with the greatest divergence
   between the three majors were: mechanics, natural science, contemporary
   issues, math, and sustainability. These differences are also reflected
   in the predominance of these topics in the curriculum at CU. Items with
   the greatest differences of opinion within architectural engineering
   majors based on standard deviation were: math, attitudes, material
   sciences, and mechanics; or based on the difference between the maximum
   and minimum rankings were: sustainability, science, and experiments
   (ranked by some as high as 1 and others as low as 24). Among civil
   engineering students the greatest differences of opinion were for the
   outcomes breadth, lifelong learning, experiments, and math; or based on
   the maximum rank minus minimum rank were: sustainability, ethics, math,
   and breadth. Finally, among environmental engineering students the
   greatest differences of opinion based on the standard deviation of the
   average ranking were for the natural science, material science, math,
   and mechanics; or based on difference in the maximum and minimum rank
   were: math and communication. Differences in the perceptions of senior
   students based on Likert-scale ratings were also determined from
   graduating senior surveys administered by the College of Engineering. In
   addition, the Fundamentals of Engineering (FE) exam is required for
   students in all three majors, and the results were compared. Recognizing
   similarities and differences points to items that are important for all
   students and should be emphasized, as well as the need to allow students
   flexibility to develop a skill set best suited to their future career
   aspirations.}},

Abstract = {{Intensive summer research programs have the opportunity to help students
   achieve a wide variety of learning outcomes, while also deepening their
   interest in graduate school and increasing their overall confidence.
   This research explored the learning outcomes from an NSF-funded Research
   Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site in environmental engineering at
   the University of Colorado Boulder. The ten-week REU site included lab,
   field, and modeling projects on the quality and treatment of water,
   soil, and air. The REU site successfully attracted an
   over-representation of female and minority participants. Among the 2011
   students there was a statistically significant gain in the likelihood
   that the students would pursue an MS degree based on pre- and
   post-survey ratings. Students' self-ratings of knowledge and skills
   related to ABET outcomes and other topics showed significant improvement
   in 22 of 26 areas, based on Likert-scale responses on pre-and
   post-surveys. The self-rated confidence in personal ability to execute
   various tasks did not show significant gains on the post survey for 12
   of 13 items. For post-survey items that asked about gains due to the
   program, some items showed statistically significant differences in
   responses based on race/ethnicity, previous research experience, year
   (freshman/sophomores vs. juniors/seniors), and major. The data indicated
   that students from all demographics could benefit from the research
   experience. Mentoring varied widely between individual students,
   projects, and years which appeared to have significant impacts on the
   students' responses. The paper concludes with recommendations for other
   REU sites to consider.}},

Abstract = {{There are a variety of national design competitions that can be used to
   form the basis of projects in environmental engineering senior capstone
   design courses. In recent years, teams of students in the Environmental
   Engineering capstone senior design course at the University of Colorado
   Boulder (CU) have participated in three different design competitions:
   the regional design competition organized by the local Water Environment
   Federation (WEF) chapter, the AECOM North American design competition,
   and an intra-collegiate competition sponsored by Halliburton. These
   competitions have been optional projects among service-learning projects
   for local and international communities and projects for local
   industries. This research compared the student preferences for different
   project types and the learning outcomes from the different projects.
   Matching the students' declared specialization within the environmental
   engineering degree program with a project helped improve student
   motivation, which is a challenge given the six different concentrations
   available to students at CU in water, air, ecology, remediation,
   chemical processing, and energy. Initially, students were not interested
   in participating in the design competitions. More recently the idea
   seems to have caught on, perhaps motivated in part by two teams winning
   their competition at the national level. However, student interest is
   still higher in service-projects. Similar learning outcomes could be
   achieved in both service-learning and design competition projects. This
   research points to the importance of offering a range of project options
   to students, and reinforces that competition projects can meet a broad
   range of learning goals.}},

Abstract = {{A workshop was held in 2011 with the goal of determining the best
   practices, benefits, and challenges of engaging in Learning Through
   Service (LTS) activities, with a focus on the engineering faculty
   perspective. LTS in engineering typically takes two forms: (1)
   course-based service-learning (SL) projects for real communities or
   individuals (such as assistive technology devices), and (2) service
   projects conducted via extracurricular activities such as Engineers
   Without Borders (EWB). Studying both of these distinct but related
   activities was of interest since extracurricular service activities such
   as EWB projects have sometimes moved into engineering courses such as
   capstone design. The group of engineering faculty and LTS researchers
   first described what excited them about LTS. Then the group shared ideas
   on best practices, benefits, and obstacles of LTS design, LTS
   management, and LTS assessment from the perspective of engineering
   faculty, the university, students, and communities. This paper focuses
   on the faculty perspective. These ideas will help faculty engaging in
   LTS to most effectively design and assess these activities.}},

Abstract = {{Important attributes for engineering professionals include an
   understanding of the global and societal impacts of engineering projects
   and a well-developed professional and ethical code of responsibility;
   these attributes must be developed in engineering students. Furthermore,
   the role of an engineer is becoming increasingly global, requiring an
   international perspective and cross-cultural skills. The core foundation
   for these skills can be found in a well-developed sense of social
   responsibility, contextualized by the engineering profession. In this
   paper a new model for the development of personal and professional
   social responsibility is proposed, the Professional Social
   Responsibility Development Model. This model is a combination of three
   existing theoretical models describing altruistic behavior development,
   commitment levels to social issues and volunteering, and the integration
   of social issues into scientific processes. The first generation of an
   assessment tool based upon the constructs of the development model has
   been designed. The reliability of the assessment tool is established
   through test-retest and internal consistency, while validity is
   established by content and construct validity methods. Based upon the
   reliability and validity results, further development of this assessment
   tool is underway in order to develop a tool which can be used to assess
   engineering students' understanding of social responsibility from
   multiple disciplines and academic years in a pre-post format.}},

Abstract = {{This recently initiated researchi, funded by the National Science
   Foundation's Division of Engineering Education and Centers, investigates
   the motivations driving members of the service organization Engineers
   Without Borders-USA (EWB-USA) in the theoretical context of identity and
   social cognitive theory. As a rare example of a professional engineering
   organization with a roughly balanced gender ratio among its membership,
   EWB-USA provides a strategic research site for unpacking gendered
   motivations and identity formations in engineering.
   Females are underrepresented in STEM fields. This is true for student
   and professional cohorts. Past research suggests that recruitment, not
   retention, is the problem for females in university engineering
   programs. In contrast to this, female engineering professionals
   experience higher attrition rates than do their male counterparts. This
   dual problem of recruitment and retention means that capable female
   engineers leave or never enter the profession, disproportionately
   contributing to the shortage of engineers. As a result, this research
   will consider an extended STEM pipeline that includes both
   undergraduates and professionals, recognizing the importance of not only
   recruiting but also retaining diverse genders in STEM.
   Social cognitive theory proposes that self-efficacy and expected
   outcomes form the basis for professional identity and motivation. This
   research will test social cognitive theory as a framework for attracting
   diverse groups to engineering. Specifically, it proposes that
   participation in EWB-USA changes the expected outcomes of
   engineering-from Dilbert to the engineer of 2020. In addition, it
   provides career scaffolding that helps members navigate careers. Both of
   these aspects are hypothesized to be particularly attractive and
   beneficial to females, which in turn is hypothesized to explain the
   gender ratios observed in the EWB-USA membership.
   This project proposes a multi-method approach. The first research phase
   is primarily qualitative and consists of data collection through
   semi-structured focus groups, interviews, and written responses to
   open-ended questions. We will conduct 28 interviews of female and male
   students and professionals involved with EWB-USA. These interviews will
   contain open-ended questions aimed at understanding the motivations for
   joining EWB, what they gain from their membership in the organization,
   what they believe to be lacking in their education, and how their
   membership has changed them. 16 focus groups will be held with female,
   male, and mixed gender groups, students and professional groups, and EWB
   and non-EWB groups. The participants in these focus groups will be asked
   many of the same questions and will be asked to vote on the most
   important and least important aspects of what the group discussed.
   Participants in both the interviews and focus groups will be asked to
   write a description of an EWB member, engineer, and themselves to
   determine perceptions of engineering identity and motivation, and
   differences in these generalizations for the various cohorts. In
   addition, at a series of EWB-USA meetings, EWB-USA members will be asked
   to write responses to open-ended questions regarding identities and
   motivations. This data will be transcribed and coded in QSR NVivo to
   analyze emergent trends. In the second phase of the research, this
   qualitative data will be used as the foundation for a quantitative
   survey that will be distributed to the memberships of EWB-USA, the
   Society of Women Engineers, the American Society of Civil Engineers, and
   the American Society of Mechanical Engineers.
   This research hypothesizes that the expected outcomes of engineering
   will vary among the targeted research cohorts, and that EWB-USA members
   will report important career scaffolding experiences due to EWB-USA
   participation. This new knowledge will be of use in the design of
   evidence-based university curriculum and industry programs to increase
   the participation of females in engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Learning Through Service (LTS), an innovative pedagogical method
   incorporating service as a means of meeting academic learning outcomes,
   is an integral part of a much-needed paradigm shift in engineering
   education. Although LTS has been around for a while and is well-known to
   spur students. growth on multiple levels, increase engagement and
   motivation, and attract women into the field, insufficient information
   is available regarding the motivations, challenges, and strategies faced
   by engineering faculty that integrate LTS in their curricular and
   extracurricular engineering education endeavors. In order to fill this
   gap, this study aims to gain a deeper understanding of the faculty's
   experience with LTS. Herein, we present the thorough development of the
   LTS Faculty Survey, designed with content and construct validation
   processes in mind and included quantitative and qualitative items, as
   well as key findings from surveyed LTS faculty experts (N=25). The
   survey enabled us to measure characteristics of LTS curricular and
   extracurricular efforts, perceived barriers faced by faculty,
   motivations for implementing LTS efforts, attitudes about LTS, etc.-all
   from a faculty perspective. Key findings suggest that major barriers for
   LTS implementation are (1) faculty time/workload, (2) problems
   coordinating with the community, and (3) the lack of policy on the role
   of LTS in promotion and tenure. In regards to major benefits, surveyed
   LTS experts find LTS experiences to not only be academically rigorous
   and enabling students to meet course and program objectives, but also
   more motivating for engineering students. The implications of these
   findings for developing a framework upon which LTS-interested faculty
   can be empowered to initiate and/or improve their own LTS efforts are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{One-on-one mentoring relationships between 1st or 2nd year engineering
   undergraduate students and graduate student mentors were established and
   monitored during a semester-long formal research mentoring program at a
   large state university. Each undergraduate student was expected to
   attend a weekly one hour seminar to learn more about the process of
   engineering research and work three to five hours per week in a research
   lab, supervised by a graduate student mentor, in order to earn one
   course credit. Pilot implementation of the program targeted
   underrepresented minorities and female undergraduate students in the
   hopes that hands-on research experience guided by a graduate student
   would improve undergraduate retention of these populations, a priority
   of the engineering college. The mentoring program also strived to
   increase interest in engineering careers and research for all students
   while providing graduate students with experience mentoring younger
   engineers. Progress towards these goals was assessed through an
   explanatory mixed-methods approach beginning with initial quantitative
   surveys, followed by qualitative weekly responses to online reflective
   questions, and concluded by a final round of quantitative surveys
   including open ended qualitative questions. Both undergraduate students
   and graduate mentors were assessed though qualitative and quantitative
   means. Following program participation, undergraduate mentees showed
   modest increases in overall motivation and confidence, though there was
   no demonstrable change in feelings of belonging in engineering. Of the
   eight undergraduate participants that completed the program, three had
   greater satisfaction with their individual graduate mentors than with
   results of program participation, three were equally satisfied with the
   program and its outcomes, and two were more satisfied with the program
   results than with their graduate mentors. Future program implementation
   will incorporate finer scales on quantitative surveys to increase the
   resolution of the data collected. Additional survey items will be added
   to further aid understanding of the program's best practices and areas
   for continued improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Despite well-intentioned efforts, our nation's education system is still
   not proficiently arming our K-12 students with the tools to succeed and
   compete in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. To
   help close achievement gaps, engineering in K-12 classrooms offers a
   real-world application of the fundamental science and math principles
   that students learn throughout their STEM education.
   K-12 engineering efforts are increasing around the nation, often
   grounded in current research on inquiry-and project-based learning,
   which has become popular as a result of the research in neuroscience and
   psychology on cognitive development. The past decade's increase in
   project-based instructional methods in K-12 education has researchers
   touting its success as a catalyst for increasing student learning of
   basic skills, complex problem solving, as well as professional skills
   and creativity. As a result, the K-12 engineering community has tailored
   project-based engineering design experiences-or, commonly known as
   PBL-for K-12 audiences. Project-based service-learning (PBSL) design
   experiences reportedly offer an added benefit of providing students with
   meaningful learning experiences in a community-based, (oftentimes local)
   context. Our analysis supports PBSL engineering design instruction as an
   intervention to increase high school student attitudes towards
   engineering and possible persistence into engineering undergraduate
   enrollment.
   This paper examines the impact of PBSL in existing high school
   engineering design courses. Specifically, we compared one section of a
   10 th grade Creative Engineering Design course at a partner high school
   course engaged in PBSL projects with two separate sections of the course
   engaged in non-service learning PBL projects at the same school, during
   the same semester. Using multiple quantitative data analysis methods
   informed by current education research, we analyzed how the context of
   PBSL engineering impacts students' attitudes and efficacy with regard to
   engineering and community service. We also examined any differential
   impacts on students by gender and ethnicity. Specifically this research
   paper addresses, ``{''}When compared to conventional design experiences,
   do PBSL design opportunities significantly increase K-12 student
   identity and interest in engineering futures, and, if so, are certain
   groups differentially affected?{''}}},

Abstract = {{Currently, the engineering community faces shortages. These shortages
   can be conceptualized as both literal shortages of numbers, particularly
   females, and a more conceptual shortage of engineers who are trained and
   qualified to handle the transitioning global context of the profession.
   With its rapid growth, high female involvement, and global vision,
   Engineers Without Borders-USA (EWB-USA) stands as a prime research model
   for the larger engineering field. During a series of five regional
   EWB-USA workshops, participants were asked to respond to six open-ended
   questions dealing with identity and gains from their involvement.
   Thousands of unique responses were coded into emergent themes to
   identify the most common responses and to compare response themes across
   questions. Results suggest that EWB-USA members identify strongly with
   the organization, which may increase their identity with and motivation
   to remain in the profession. Results also show that EWB-USA members are
   filling significant education gaps from their organizational involvement
   and are gaining the desirable global engineering qualities required
   within the field. These results help unpack the motivations driving
   EWB-USA members and gains from their membership that may help, through
   future curriculum development, attract and retain a diverse engineering
   population able to handle future challenges required by the profession.}},

Abstract = {{Learning Through Service (LTS) is a pedagogical method that encompasses
   curricular and extracurricular service learning in engineering. Though
   the numerous benefits of LTS are apparent to those who engage in it, the
   barriers are also plentiful, as evident by the reluctance of many
   instructors to engage in LTS. As a joint effort to create a community of
   LTS scholars, a summit held in Fall 2011 brought together faculty
   members actively engaged in LTS activities in a wide variety of
   capacities and from a wide variety of disciplines. In addition to the
   many workshops conducted as part of the summit, three semi-structured
   focus groups were held during which open dialogue ensued regarding the
   best practices and challenges in the execution of LTS. The current study
   presents thematic findings that emerged from these focus groups.}},

   used 11 humanoids in order to investigate the basic tendency of humans
   to evaluate humanoids. In addition, we included wheeled-walking robots,
   biped-walking robots, and androids in order to consider the influence of
   the type of humanoid. We collected data from 2,624 Japanese individuals,
   ranging from teenagers to people in their 70s, in three major cities in
   order to obtain maximally representative data. For our psychological
   scale, we used a humanoid-oriented scale that was developed on the basis
   of parameters for the evaluation of humanoids according to the
   perspectives of ordinary people. These parameters are familiarity,
   utility, and humanness. The results show that middle-aged and older
   females tend to rate the familiarity and humanness of all humanoids
   higher, adolescents tend to rate the familiarity and utility of
   wheeled-walking humanoids higher and the utility of androids lower, and
   middle-aged people tend to rate the utility of all humanoids higher. We
   discuss the improved design of humanoids considering both human
   characteristics and types of humanoids.}},

Title = {{Carbon, metals, and grain size correlate with bacterial community
   structure in sediments of a high arsenic aquifer}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Bacterial communities can exert significant influence on the
   biogeochemical cycling of arsenic (As). This has globally important
   implications since As in drinking water affects the health of over 100
   million people worldwide, including in the Ganges-Brahmaputra Delta
   region of Bangladesh where geogenic arsenic in groundwater can reach
   concentrations of more than 10 times the World Health Organization's
   limit.Thus, the goal of this research was to investigate patterns in
   bacterial community composition across gradients in sediment texture and
   chemistry in an aquifer with elevated groundwater As concentrations in
   Araihazar, Bangladesh.We characterized the bacterial community by
   pyrosequencing 16S rRNA genes from aquifer sediment samples collected at
   three locations along a groundwater flow path at a range of depths
   between 1.5 and 15m. We identified significant differences in bacterial
   community composition between locations in the aquifer. In addition, we
   found that bacterial community structure was significantly related to
   sediment grain size, and sediment carbon (C), manganese (Mn), and iron
   (Fe) concentrations. Deltaproteobacteria and Chloroflexi were found in
   higher proportions in silty sediments with higher concentrations of C,
   Fe, and Mn. By contrast, Alphaproteobacteria and Betaproteobacteria were
   in higher proportions in sandy sediments with lower concentrations of C
   and metals. Based on the phylogenetic affiliations of these taxa, these
   results may indicate a shift to more Fe-, Mn-, and humic
   substance-reducers in the high C and metal sediments. It is
   well-documented that C, Mn, and Fe may influence the mobility of
   groundwater arsenic, and it is intriguing that these constituents may
   also structure the bacterial community.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents TMProf, a transactional memory (TM) profiler, based
   on three visualization principles. These principles are (i) the precise
   graphical representation of transaction interactions including
   cross-correlated information and source code, (ii) visualized soft
   real-time playback of concurrently executing transactions, and (iii)
   dynamic visualizations of multiple executions. We describe how these
   principles break new ground and create new challenges for TM pro filers.
   We discuss our experience using TMProf with InvalSTM, a state-of-the-art
   software TM, and show how TMProf's feedback led to the design of two new
   contention managers (CMs). We demonstrate the performance benefits of
   these CMs, which generally led to improved performance as the amount of
   work and threads increase per benchmark. Our experimental results show
   that iBalanced, one of our newly designed CMs, can increase transaction
   throughput by nearly 10 x over iFair, InvalSTM's previously best
   performing CM.}},

Abstract = {{As we pursue efforts to lower the capital and installation costs of
   parabolic trough solar collectors, it is essential to maintain high
   optical performance. While there are many optical tools available to
   measure the reflector slope errors of parabolic trough solar collectors,
   there are few tools to measure the absorber alignment. A new method is
   presented here to measure the absorber alignment in two dimensions to
   within 0.5 cm. The absorber alignment is measured using a digital camera
   and four photo grammetric targets. Physical contact with the receiver
   absorber or glass is not necessary. The alignment of the absorber is
   measured along its full length so that sagging of the absorber can be
   quantified with this technique. The resulting absorber alignment
   measurement provides critical information required to accurately
   determine the intercept factor of a collector}},

   (Oaxaca), Guaymas (Sonora) and Mexicali (Baja California Norte) were the
   four locations selected to assess the potential available energy
   resources in meeting cost-effectively and sustainably the electricity
   and thermal loads of small communities in Mexico. Electricity and
   thermal loads are obtained for the four locations by using calibrated
   building energy models for residential buildings in Mexico. Based on the
   feasibility analysis, it is found that while hybrid systems can reduce
   significantly CO2 emissions, they are not cost-effective to implement in
   all locations due to the relatively cheap electricity costs from the
   only federal utility company in Mexico.}},

Abstract = {{The glaciers on the summit plateau of Kibo, the main peak of the
   Kilimanjaro massif (3 degrees S, 37 degrees E, 5895 m a.s.l.) in
   Tanzania, are characterized by steep ice cliffs at their margins. These
   form-persistent cliffs continuously retreat and, consequently, govern
   the decrease in plateau glacier area. In order to quantify the ice cliff
   recession and study their morphology, close-range terrestrial
   photogrammetry combined with automatic stereo matching techniques was
   used to derive high resolution digital surface models of a south-facing
   ``sample cliff{''} at four different dates. Results confirm, firstly,
   the annually bimodal nature of the recession being 15 cm/month during a
   4.5 month sunlit phase and 2 cm/month during the remaining 7.5 month
   shaded phase, and, secondly, the tendency towards an ``ideal cliff
   orientation{''}, which is either south- or north-facing and about
   700-750 steep. Moreover, the hypothesis of a predefined decay period for
   the plateau ice is supported by this study and it is shown that
   terrestrial photogrammetry is not only cheap and lightweight but also
   very suitable for ice surveys at the decameter scale.}},

Abstract = {{We have synthesized a biomaterial consisting of Gd(III) ions chelated to
   lipid-coated, size-selected microbubbles for utility in both magnetic
   resonance and ultrasound imaging. The macrocyclic ligand DOTA-NHS was
   bound to PE headgroups on the lipid shell of pre-synthesized
   microbubbles. Gd(III) was then chelated to DOTA on the microbubble
   shell. The reaction temperature was optimized to increase the rate of
   Gd(111) chelation while maintaining microbubble stability. ICP-OES
   analysis of the microbubbles determined a surface density of 7.5 x 10(5)
   3.0 x 10(5) Gd(III)/mu m(2) after chelation at 50 degrees C. The
   Gd(III)-bound microbubbles were found to be echogenic in vivo during
   high-frequency ultrasound imaging of the mouse kidney. The Gd(III)-bound
   microbubbles also were characterized by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   at 9.4 T by a spin-echo technique and, surprisingly, both the
   longitudinal and transverse proton relaxation rates were found to be
   roughly equal to that of no-Gd(III) control microbubbles and saline.
   However, the relaxation rates increased significantly, and in a
   dose-dependent manner, after sonication was used to fragment the
   Gd(III)-bound microbubbles into non-gas-containing lipid bilayer
   remnants. The longitudinal (r(1)) and transverse (r(2)) molar
   relaxivities were 4.0 +/- 0.4 and 120 +/- 18 mM(-1)s(-1), respectively,
   based on Gd(III) content. The Gd(III)-bound microbubbles may find
   application in the measurement of cavitation events during MRI-guided
   focused ultrasound therapy and to track the biodistribution of shell
   remnants. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymers (SMPs) can fix a temporary shape and recover their
   permanent shape in response to environmental stimuli such as heat,
   electricity, or irradiation. Most thermally activated SMPs use the
   macromolecular chain mobility change around the glass transition
   temperature (T-g) to achieve the shape memory (SM) effects. During this
   process, the stiffness of the material typically changes by three orders
   of magnitude. Recently, a composite materials approach was developed to
   achieve thermally activated shape memory effect where the material
   exhibits elastomeric response in both the temporary and the recovered
   configurations. These shape memory elastomeric composites (SMECs)
   consist of an elastomeric matrix reinforced by a semicrystalline polymer
   fiber network. The matrix provides background rubber elasticity while
   the fiber network can transform between solid crystals and melt phases
   over the operative temperature range. As such it servers as a reversible
   ``switching phase{''} that enables shape fixing and recovery. Shape
   memory elastomeric composites provide a new paradigm for the development
   of a wide array of active polymer composites that utilize the
   melt-crystal transition to achieve the shape memory effect. This
   potentially allows for material systems and much simpler chemistries
   than most shape memory polymers and thus can facilitate more rapid
   material development and insertion. It is therefore important to
   understand the thermomechanical behavior and to develop corresponding
   material models. In this paper, a 3D finite-deformation constitutive
   modeling framework was developed to describe the thermomechanical
   behaviour of SMEC. The model is phenomenological, although inspired by
   micromechanical consideration of load tranfer between the matrix and
   fiber phases of a composite system. It treats the matrix as an elastomer
   and the fibers as a complex solid that itself is an aggregate of melt
   and crystal phases that evolve from one to the other during a
   temperature change. As such, the composite consists of an elastomer
   reinforced by a soft liquid at high temperature and a stiff solid at low
   temperature. The model includes a kinetic description of the
   non-isothermal crystallization and melting of the fibers during a
   temperature change. As the fibers tranform from melt to crystal during
   cooling it is assumed that new crystals are formed in an undeformed
   state, which requires careful tracking of the kinematics of the evolving
   phases which comes at a significant computational cost. In order to
   improve the computational efficiency, an effective phase model (EPM) is
   adopted to treat the evolving crystal phases as an effective medium. A
   suite of careful thermomechanical experiments with a SMEC was carried
   out to calibrate various model parameters, and then to demonstrate the
   ability of the model to accurately capture the shape memory behavior of
   the SMEC system during complex thermomechanical loading scenarios. The
   model also identifies the effects of microstructural design parameters
   such as the fiber volume fraction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The femtosecond-fast transport in metal-insulator-metal (MIM) tunnel
   diodes makes them attractive for applications such as ultra-high
   frequency rectenna detectors and solar cells, and mixers. These
   applications impose severe requirements on the diode current-voltage
   I(V) characteristics. For example, rectennas operating at terahertz or
   higher frequencies require diodes to have low resistance and adequate
   nonlinearity. To analyze and design MIM diodes with the desired
   characteristics, we developed a simulator based on the transfer-matrix
   method, and verified its accuracy by comparing simulated I(V)
   characteristics with those measured in MIM diodes that we fabricated by
   sputtering, and also with simulations based on the quantum transmitting
   boundary method. Single-insulator low-resistance diodes are not
   sufficiently nonlinear for efficient rectennas. Multi-insulator diodes
   can be engineered to provide both low resistance and substantial
   nonlinearity. The improved performance of multi-insulator diodes can
   result from either resonant tunneling or a step change in tunneling
   distance with voltage, either of which can be made to dominate by the
   appropriate choice of insulators and barrier thicknesses. The stability
   of the interfaces in the MIIM diodes is confirmed through a
   thermodynamic analysis. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The Colorado Coarse Rural Urban Sources and Health study (CCRUSH) is an
   ongoing study of the relationship between coarse particulate mass
   concentrations (PM10-2.5, particulate matter with diameter between 2.5
   and 10 mu m) and selected health effects. For two urban monitoring sites
   in Denver, CO, and two comparatively rural sites in Greeley, CO, hourly
   mass concentrations of PM10-2.5 and fine particulate matter (PM2.5,
   diameter less than 2.5 mu m) have been measured by using dichotomous
   tapered element oscillating microbalances (TEOMs) with Filter Dynamics
   Measurement Systems (FDMS). This paper presents air quality results from
   just over a year of PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 measurements. Average PM2.5
   concentrations ranged from 7.7 to 9.2 mu g m(-3) across the four sites
   with higher concentrations in Denver than Greeley. Average PM10-2.5
   concentrations ranged from 9.0 to 15.5 mu g m(-3) with the highest
   values at the site in northeast Denver. Temporal variability in PM10-2.5
   was higher than that in PM2.5 concentrations at all four sites. The two
   Greeley sites displayed moderate spatial correlation for PM2.5 and high
   correlation for PM10-2.5, whereas the two Denver sites showed lower
   spatial correlation for both PM sizes. PM10-2.5 concentrations in Denver
   were highest with winds from the direction of the city's urban core.
   PM10-2.5 concentrations in Greeley weremoderately elevated with winds
   from the southwest to the northwest, coming from Denver and other large
   Front Range communities. Wind speed regressions for PM10-2.5 at the
   Denver sites primarily exhibited resuspension effects, while PM10-2.5
   concentrations in Greeley showed relatively complex wind speed
   dependence.}},
