Abstract = {{This paper accompanies a map that shows the extent of permafrost in the
   Northern Hemisphere between 25 and 17 thousand years ago. The map is
   based upon existing archival data, common throughout the Northern
   Hemisphere, that include ice-wedge pseudomorphs, sand wedges and large
   cryoturbations. Where possible, a distinction is made between areas with
   continuous permafrost and areas where permafrost is either spatially
   discontinuous or sporadic. The associated mean annual
   palaeo-temperatures that are inferred on the basis of present-day
   analogues increase understanding of the possible changes in permafrost
   extent that might accompany current global warming trends. Areas with
   relict permafrost and areas that were formerly exposed due to lower sea
   level (submarine permafrost) are also mapped. Mapping is mostly limited
   to lowland regions (areas approximately <1000m a.s.l.). Striking
   features that appear from the map are (i) the narrow permafrost zone in
   North America, which contrasts with the broader LPM permafrost zone in
   Eurasia (that may be related to different snow thickness or vegetation
   cover), (ii) the zonal extent of former LPM permafrost (that may reflect
   sea-ice distribution), which contrasts with the present-day pattern of
   permafrost extent (especially in Eurasia) and (iii) the relatively
   narrow zones of LPM discontinuous permafrost (that may indicate strong
   temperature gradients).}},

Abstract = {{Approximately 400,000 ventral hernia repair surgeries are performed each
   year in the United States. Many of these procedures are performed using
   laparoscopic minimally invasive techniques and employ the use of
   surgical mesh. The use of surgical mesh has been shown to reduce
   recurrence rates compared to standard suture repairs. The placement of
   surgical mesh in a ventral hernia repair procedure can be challenging,
   and may even complicate the procedure. Others have attempted to provide
   commercial solutions to the problems of mesh placement, but these have
   not been well accepted by the clinical community. In this article, two
   versions of shape memory polymer (SMP)-modified surgical mesh, and
   unmodified surgical mesh, were compared by performing laparoscopic
   manipulation in an acute porcine model. Also, SMP-integrated polyester
   surgical meshes were implanted in four rats for 30-33 days to evaluate
   chronic biocompatibility and capacity for tissue integration. Porcine
   results show that the modified mesh provides a controlled,
   temperature-activated, automated deployment when compared to an
   unmodified mesh. In rats, results indicate that implanted SMP-modified
   meshes exhibit exceptional biocompatibility and excellent integration
   with surrounding tissue with no noticeable differences from the
   unmodified counterpart. This article provides further evidence that an
   SMP-modified surgical mesh promises reduction in surgical placement time
   and that such a mesh is not substantially different from unmodified
   meshes in chronic biocompatibility. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) govern phenotypic adaptations and
   reflect the trade-offs between physiological responses and evolutionary
   adaptation that act at different time-scales. To identify patterns of
   molecular function and genetic diversity in GRNs, we studied the drought
   response of the common sunflower, Helianthus annuus, and how the
   underlying GRN is related to its evolution. We examined the responses of
   32423 expressed sequences to drought and to abscisic acid (ABA) and
   selected 145 co-expressed transcripts. We characterized their regulatory
   relationships in nine kinetic studies based on different hormones. From
   this, we inferred a GRN by meta-analyses of a Gaussian graphical model
   and a random forest algorithm and studied the genetic differentiation
   among populations (FST) at nodes. We identified two main hubs in the
   network that transport nitrate in guard cells. This suggests that
   nitrate transport is a critical aspect of the sunflower physiological
   response to drought. We observed that differentiation of the network
   genes in elite sunflower cultivars is correlated with their position and
   connectivity. This systems biology approach combined molecular data at
   different time-scales and identified important physiological processes.
   At the evolutionary level, we propose that network topology could
   influence responses to human selection and possibly adaptation to dry
   environments.}},

Abstract = {{Since 1995 several ice shelves in the Northern Antarctic Peninsula have
   collapsed and triggered ice-mass unloading, invoicing a solid Earth
   response that has been recorded at continuous GPS (cGPS) stations. A
   previous attempt to model the observation of rapid uplift following the
   2002 breakup of Larsen B Ice Shelf was limited by incomplete knowledge
   of the pattern of ice unloading and possibly the assumption of an
   elastic-only mechanism. We make use of a new high resolution dataset of
   ice elevation change that captures ice-mass loss north of 66 S to first
   show that non-linear uplift of the Palmer cGPS station since 2002 cannot
   be explained by elastic deformation alone. We apply a viscoelastic model
   with linear Maxwell rheology to predict uplift since 1995 and test the
   fit to the Palmer cGPS time series, finding a well constrained upper
   mantle viscosity but less sensitivity to lithospheric thickness. We
   further constrain the best fitting Earth model by including six cGPS
   stations deployed after 2009 (the LARISSA network), with vertical
   velocities in the range 1.7 to 14.9 mm/yr. This results in a best
   fitting Earth model with lithospheric thickness of 100-140 km and upper
   mantle viscosity of 6 x 10(17)-2 x 10(18) Pas - much lower than
   previously suggested for this region. Combining the LARISSA time series
   with the Palmer cGPS time series offers a rare opportunity to study the
   time-evolution of the low-viscosity solid Earth response to a
   well-captured ice unloading event. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{Heat extraction by cold water circulation disturbs the thermo-chemical
   equilibrium of a geothermal reservoir, activating the
   dissolution/precipitation of minerals in the fractures. Calcite being a
   more reactive mineral than other rock minerals composing the earth
   curst, we investigate the permeability alteration during geothermal heat
   production from carbonate reservoirs. In this study the simulations are
   performed using the code FEHM with coupled thermo-hydro-chemical (THC)
   capabilities for a three dimensional domain. The computational domain
   consists of a single fracture connecting the injection and production
   wells. For reactive alteration of aperture, the model considers that the
   kinetics of dissolution/precipitation is coupled to the equilibrium
   interactions among the aqueous species/ions. The reaction rate
   predominantly depends on the temperature dependent solubility and
   advective-dispersive solute transport in the fracture. Due to the
   nonuniform flow fields resulting from injection and production, the
   coupled thermo-hydro-chemical processes initiate significant variation
   of the aperture alteration rate over the fracture. We have considered
   different operating conditions such as different mass injection rate,
   injection temperature and concentration of minerals. Our simulations
   show that dissolution and precipitation can occur simultaneously at
   different locations in fracture. Furthermore the reaction rate varies
   with time and the reaction rate can also switch between dissolution and
   precipitation. To illustrate this interesting behavior, the variations
   of shape and size of zero reaction rate contours with time are shown. An
   interesting outcome is a non-monotonic evolution of the overall
   transmissivity between the wells. The alteration of overall
   transmissivity largely depends on the concentration of mineral in the
   injected water. with respect to the solubility at the initial fracture
   temperature. For both dissolution and precipitation controlled cases,
   the rapid changes in transmissivity provide challenges for maintaining
   circulation of water at constant mass flow rate. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{As part of a long-term observation campaign, over 5000 pair samples of
   temporally matched 1-minute averaged drop size distribution (DSD)
   measurements have been recorded by two side-by-side (frequently
   calibrated) 2D-video disdrometers. The measurement campaign was
   conducted in Huntsville, Alabama, over a ten-month period, and includes
   a variety of rain types and regimes. The datasets have been used to
   examine, (i) the relationship between the mass-weighted mean diameter
   (D-m) and the standard deviation of the mass spectrum (sigma(M)) without
   any assumption on the DSD form, and (ii) the relationship between the
   shape parameter (g) and slope parameter (Lambda) of the gamma form of
   the DSD. A number of methods were used to estimate mu and Lambda
   including: a normalizing procedure, the method of moments, the maximum
   likelihood method and the L-moment method. The physical validity of the
   sigma(M)-D-m relationship is examined by, (i) relating the estimated D-m
   versus the estimated am from the same disdrometer datasets and, (ii) by
   `cross-relating' D-m from one disdrometer with the corresponding
   sigma(M) from the second disdrometer dataset The same procedures were
   repeated to examine the physical validity of the mu-Lambda relation. It
   is shown that the transformed variable sigma(M)' = sigma D-M(m)-1.65,
   which is uncorrelated with D-m, has a narrow histogram and that
   sigma(M)' approximate to constant can form a constraint which may well
   be applicable to other rain climatologies. For the mu-Lambda
   relationship, the variation between mu from one unit and Lambda by the
   second unit showed, as expected, larger scatter than using estimates
   from the same unit but not excessively so given that the mu estimates
   from the two units themselves show some instrument-to-instrument
   variability. While we cannot ascertain that the removal of any
   statistical correlations necessarily implies that the mu-Lambda relation
   is physical, we have gone on to show that instrument limitations of
   accurately measuring the number concentration at the small drop end (D <
   0.5 mm) are likely to be more important in giving rise to spuriously
   large values and related higher mu-Lambda correlation, especially in
   light rain, and perhaps to a lesser extent in heavier rain. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This paper quantitatively evaluates structural failure of biaxial
   cohesionless ellipsoids that have a two-density-layer distribution. The
   internal density layer is modeled as a sphere, while the external
   density layer is the rest of the part. The density is supposed to be
   constant in each layer. The present study derives averaged stresses over
   the whole volume of these bodies and uses limit analysis to determine
   their global failure. The upper bound of global failure is considered in
   terms of the size of the internal layer and the aspect ratio of the
   shape. The result shows that the two-density-layer causes the body to
   have different strength against structural failure. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Aluminium oxide (Al2O3) and titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanoparticles (NPs)
   have been widely used in nanotechnology-based products. Recently,
   researchers and the public have raised concerns about the adverse
   effects of these NPs in biological systems, particularly in humans. The
   aim of this study was to investigate the possible adverse effects of
   these two common metal oxide NPs on human lung epithelium cells (A549)
   and to investigate NP size-dependent effects on these cells, considering
   both the primary and hydrodynamic particle size. NPs were found to
   inhibit cell viability and proliferation at the highest concentration
   level (10mg/mL) included in this study, as measured by a clonogenic
   assay. Moreover, cell viability, proliferation and metabolism were
   impaired to a greater extent by the smaller NPs (5nm TiO2 and 10nm
   Al2O3) relative to the larger particles (200nm TiO2 and 50nm Al2O3)
   included in this study, as measured by cell proliferation and
   metabolism. Notably, the observed cytotoxic effects correlated to the
   primary size, rather than the hydrodynamic size. Similarly, NP
   cytotoxicity was found to be correlated with the NP surface area. These
   findings highlight the importance of including primary size and surface
   area information in NP characterisation in cytotoxicity studies.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear dimensionality reduction embeddings computed from datasets do
   not provide a mechanism to compute the inverse map. In this paper, we
   address the problem of computing a stable inverse map to such a general
   bi-Lipschitz map. Our approach relies on radial basis functions (RBFs)
   to interpolate the inverse map everywhere on the low-dimensional image
   of the forward map. We demonstrate that the scale-free cubic RBF kernel
   performs better than the Gaussian kernel: it does not suffer from
   ill-conditioning, and does not require the choice of a scale. The
   proposed construction is shown to be similar to the Nystrom extension of
   the eigenvectors of the symmetric normalized graph Laplacian matrix.
   Based on this observation, we provide a new interpretation of the
   Nystrom extension with suggestions for improvement. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{To help elucidate the mechanisms for solute transport in polyamicle (PA)
   and cellulose acetate (CA) reverse-osmosis membranes, we have conducted
   temperature-variation permeation experiments with aqueous solutions
   containing NaCl and 3- and 4-carbon solutes that possess different
   numbers of hydroxyl groups. Mass transport metrics were calculated using
   the solution-diffusion model and the Eyring equation. The molar volume
   of the neutral (organic) solute is less important than the number of
   hydroxyl groups in determining solute permeance. For both membrane
   materials, the neutral solutes with higher permeance also have higher
   activation enthalpies for permeation, and higher predicted solubilities
   in the polymer based on Hansen solubility parameters. The higher
   activation enthalpies may be associated with lower mobility due to more
   favorable polymer-penetrant interactions. The solution-diffusion
   permeance coefficients provide a reasonable estimate of permeate
   composition at different pressures with a new set of membranes. AL
   elevated temperatures of 320 K, we found negative rejections of
   n-propanol and n-butanol in the CA membrane, while maintaining
   relatively high electrolyte and glycerol rejections. Using these
   results, we suggest a strategy to efficiently harvest n-butanol produced
   by Clostridium pasteurianum while retaining its glycerol carbon source
   and nutrient electrolytes. (c) 2014 Elsevier By. All rights reserved.}},

   nature of the oxidation scale. The high density of the oxidation scale
   is attributed to a volume increase when silicon carbide oxidizes and

   conductivity of 14W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature. Design approaches for

Abstract = {{Reflectometry of signals of opportunity such as those emitted by a
   global navigation satellite system, known as GNSS-R, has been developed
   over the past years as a technique with great potential for ocean
   scatterometry, among other applications. Different approaches have been
   proposed to use GNSS-R for remote sensing of ocean surface roughness.
   One of them is based on deriving some descriptor/metric from the
   measured delay-Doppler map (DDM) and directly relating it to a
   geophysical property of the scattering surface. For instance, different
   descriptors have been proposed in the literature to measure the DDM
   spreading caused by the increase in ocean surface mean square slopes due
   to surface winds. In this paper, a new descriptor based on the DDM is
   proposed for wind direction retrieval. This descriptor, designated as
   the skewness angle phi(1,skew), measures the asymmetry in the DDM power
   distribution along the Doppler frequency axis, and it was modeled as a
   function of wind direction by means of a simulation study. Then, that
   model was validated using real GNSS-R data from an airborne experiment.
   After validation, the DDM skewness model was successfully used for wind
   direction retrieval, with a resulting rms error on the order of 20
   degrees.}},

   tuned to the plasmon resonance of the nanorods used in this work, allows
   for the specific heating of nano-alpha EGFR to the point of localized
   cellular death. Such an approach, administering nano-alpha EGFR

Abstract = {{This paper studies how electromagnetic interference (EMI) filters affect
   the harmonic distortion in high-power-factor converters. The EMI filter
   presents a tradeoff: higher noise attenuation results in higher harmonic
   distortion. In many modern converters, the EMI filter is designed to
   meet certain noise requirements. However, when tested in practice, the
   filter, while attenuating the EMI noise well, is found to generate high
   harmonic distortion, and should be redesigned. The cause of this
   distortion is a nonlinear interaction of the filter and the bridge
   rectifier. The current understanding of this process is incomplete,
   especially in modern converters that use high-order LC filters, and
   modern low-cost inverters. As a result, harmonic distortion is typically
   tuned by repeated trial-and-errors. In this paper, we provide a simple
   model for evaluating the harmonic distortion. The harmonic distortion is
   shown to be dominated by a single parameter: the filter total
   capacitance. The total harmonic distortion and capacitance are shown to
   be to be related by a simple power-law function. This relation is proved
   to be accurate if the total filter inductance is smaller than a given
   threshold. Experimental results show that total harmonic distortion can
   be estimated by the capacitance, with a normalized error of 0.09\%.}},

   the visualization of the p-n junction location without the need to make
   patterned electrical contacts to the NW. Spatially resolved measurements
   of S-11', which is the derivative of the RF reflection coefficient S-11
   with respect to voltage, varied strongly when probing axially along the
   NW and across the p-n junction. The axial variation in S-11' effectively
   mapped the asymmetric depletion arising from the doping concentrations
   on either side of the junction. Furthermore, variation of the probe tip
   voltage altered the apparent extent of features associated with the p-n
   junction in S-11' images. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We propose optimal designs for triply-resonant parametric oscillators
   (OPOs) based on degenerate four-wave mixing (FWM) in microcavities. We
   show that optimal designs in general call for different external
   coupling to pump and signal/idler resonances. We provide a number of
   normalized performance metrics including threshold pump power and
   maximum achievable conversion efficiency for OPOs with and without
   two-photon (TPA) and free-carrier absorption (FCA). We find that the
   maximum achievable conversion efficiency is bound to an upper limit by
   nonlinear and free-carrier losses independent of pump power, while
   linear losses only increase the pump power required to achieve a certain
   conversion efficiency. The results of this work suggest unique
   advantages in on-chip implementations that allow explicit engineering of
   resonances, mode field overlaps, dispersion, and wavelength-and
   mode-selective coupling. We provide universal design curves that yield
   optimum designs, and give example designs of microring-resonator-based
   OPOs in silicon at the wavelengths 1.55 mu m (with TPA) and 2.3 mu m (no
   TPA) as well as in silicon nitride (Si3N4) at 1.55 mu m. For typical
   microcavity quality factor of 10(6), we show that the oscillation
   threshold in excitation bus can be well into the sub-mW regime for
   silicon microrings and a few mW for silicon nitride microrings. The
   conversion efficiency can be a few percent when pumped at 10 times of
   the threshold. Next, based on our results, we suggest a family of
   synthetic ``photonic molecule{''}-like, coupled-cavity systems to
   implement optimum FWM, where structure design for control of resonant
   wavelengths can be separated from that of optimizing nonlinear
   conversion efficiency, and where furthermore pump, signal, and idler
   coupling to bus waveguides can be controlled independently, using
   interferometric cavity supermode coupling as an example. Finally,
   consideration of these complex geometries calls for a generalization of
   the nonlinear figure of merit (NFOM) as a metric for performance in
   nonlinear photonic systems, and shows different efficiencies for single
   and multi-cavity geometries, as well as for standing and traveling wave
   excitations. (C) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Month = {{JUN 26}},
Abstract = {{Thermoelectric (TE) devices are solid-state energy converters that can
   be used for power generation through the Seebeck effect and TE cooling
   through the Peltier effect. Nanostructures give great opportunities to
   engineer TE energy conversion efficiency. In this work, we investigate
   TE transport properties in structured nanowires (NWs) in the ballistic
   transport regime, where the NWs are bent, kinked, stubbed and segmented
   like a superlattice nanowire using the Green's function method and the
   Landauer-Buttiker formula. A large Seebeck coefficient is found when the
   transmission gap appears due to the quantum interference effect of
   electrons. The sign of the Seebeck coefficient can be controlled by the
   geometries of these structured NWs. This finding is helpful for the
   design of nanoscale TE devices, such as thermocouple, with the same type
   of material doping rather than those comprised of n-type and p-type

Abstract = {{The PHENIX experiment has measured open heavy-flavor production via
   semileptonic decay over the transverse momentum range 1 < p(T) < 6 GeV/c
   at forward and backward rapidity (1.4 < vertical bar y vertical bar <
   2.0) in d + Au and p + p collisions at root s(NN) = 200 GeV. In central
   d + Au collisions, relative to the yield in p + p collisions scaled by
   the number of binary nucleon-nucleon collisions, a suppression is
   observed at forward rapidity (in the d-going direction) and an
   enhancement at backward rapidity (in the Au-going direction).
   Predictions using nuclear-modified-parton-distribution functions, even
   with additional nuclear-p(T) broadening, cannot simultaneously reproduce
   the data at both rapidity ranges, which implies that these models are
   incomplete and suggests the possible importance of final-state
   interactions in the asymmetric d + Au collision system. These results
   can be used to probe cold-nuclear-matter effects, which may
   significantly affect heavy-quark production, in addition to helping
   constrain the magnitude of charmonia-breakup effects in nuclear matter.}},

Abstract = {{Controlling the kinetics and gelation of photopolymerization is a
   significant challenge in the fabrication of complex three-dimensional
   (3D) objects as is critical in numerous imaging, lithography, and
   additive manufacturing techniques. We propose a novel, visible light
   sensitive ``photoinitibitor{''} which simultaneously generates two
   distinct radicals, each with their own unique purpose one radical each
   for initiation and inhibition. The Janus-faced functions of this
   photoinitibitor delay gelation and dramatically amplify the gelation
   time difference between the constructive and destructive interference
   regions of the exposed holographic pattern. This approach enhances the
   photopolymerization induced phase separation of liquid crystal/acrylate
   resins and the formation of fine holographic polymer dispersed liquid
   crystal (HPDLC) gratings. Moreover, we construct colored 3D holographic
   images that are visually recognizable to the naked eye under white
   light.}},

Abstract = {{When a single molecule is detected in a wide-field microscope, the image
   approximates the point spread function of the system. However, as the
   distribution of molecules becomes denser and their images begin to
   overlap, existing solutions to determine the number of molecules present
   and their precise three-dimensional locations can tolerate little to no
   overlap. We propose a localization scheme that can identify several
   overlapping molecule images while maintaining high localization
   precision. A solution to this problem involving matched optical and
   digital techniques, as here proposed, can substantially increase the
   allowable labeling density and accelerate the data collection time of
   single-molecule localization microscopy by more than one order of
   magnitude.}},

Title = {{Channel cracks in atomic-layer and molecular-layer deposited multilayer
   thin film coatings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 21}},
Abstract = {{Metal oxide thin film coatings produced by atomic layer deposition have
   been shown to be an effective permeation barrier. The primary failure
   mode of such coatings under tensile loads is the propagation of channel
   cracks that penetrate vertically into the coating films. Recently,
   multi-layer structures that combine the metal oxide material with
   relatively soft polymeric layers produced by molecular layer deposition
   have been proposed to create composite thin films with desired
   properties, including potentially enhanced resistance to fracture. In
   this paper, we study the effects of layer geometry and material
   properties on the critical strain for channel crack propagation in the
   multi-layer composite films. Using finite element simulations and a
   thin-film fracture mechanics formalism, we show that if the fracture
   energy of the polymeric layer is lower than that of the metal oxide
   layer, the channel crack tends to penetrate through the entire composite
   film, and dividing the metal oxide and polymeric materials into thinner
   layers leads to a smaller critical strain. However, if the fracture
   energy of the polymeric material is high so that cracks only run through
   the metal oxide layers, more layers can result in a larger critical
   strain. For intermediate fracture energy of the polymer material, we
   developed a design map that identifies the optimal structure for given
   fracture energies and thicknesses of the metal oxide and polymeric
   layers. These results can facilitate the design of mechanically robust
   permeation barriers, an important component for the development of
   flexible electronics. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The recent emergence of topological insulators (TI) has spurred
   intensive efforts to grow TI thin films on various substrates. However,
   little is known about how robust the topological surface states (TSS)
   are against disorders and other detrimental effects originating from the
   substrates. Here, we report the observation of a well-defined TSS on
   Bi2Se3 films grown on amorphous SiO2 (a-SiO2) substrates and a large
   gating effect on these films using the underneath doped-Si substrate as
   the back gate. The films on a-SiO2 were composed of c-axis ordered but
   random in-plane domains. However, despite the in-plane randomness
   induced by the amorphous substrate, the transport properties of these
   films were superior to those of similar films grown on
   single-crystalline Si(111) substrates, which are structurally better
   matched but chemically reactive with the films. This work sheds light on
   the importance of chemical compatibility, compared to lattice matching,
   for the growth of TI thin films, and also demonstrates that the
   technologically important and gatable a-SiO2/Si substrate is a promising
   platform for TI films. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Radiocarbon (14C) analysis is a unique tool to distinguish
   fossil/nonfossil sources of carbonaceous aerosols. We present 14C
   measurements of organic carbon (OC) and total carbon (TC) on highly time
   resolved filters (3-4 h, typically 12 h or longer have been reported)
   from 7 days collected during California Research at the Nexus of Air
   Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) 2010 in Pasadena. Average nonfossil
   contributions of 58\%+/- 15\% and 51\%+/- 15\% were found for OC and TC,
   respectively. Results indicate that nonfossil carbon is a major
   constituent of the background aerosol, evidenced by its nearly constant
   concentration (2-3 gC m-3). Cooking is estimated to contribute at least
   25\% to nonfossil OC, underlining the importance of urban nonfossil OC
   sources. In contrast, fossil OC concentrations have prominent and
   consistent diurnal profiles, with significant afternoon enhancements
   (similar to 3 gC m-3), following the arrival of the western Los Angeles
   (LA) basin plume with the sea breeze. A corresponding increase in
   semivolatile oxygenated OC and organic vehicular emission markers and
   their photochemical reaction products occurs. This suggests that the
   increasing OC is mostly from fresh anthropogenic secondary OC (SOC) from
   mainly fossil precursors formed in the western LA basin plume. We note
   that in several European cities where the diesel passenger car fraction
   is higher, SOC is 20\% less fossil, despite 2-3 times higher elemental
   carbon concentrations, suggesting that SOC formation from gasoline
   emissions most likely dominates over diesel in the LA basin. This would
   have significant implications for our understanding of the on-road
   vehicle contribution to ambient aerosols and merits further study.}},

Abstract = {{We present the first comprehensive intercomparison of currently
   available satellite ozone climatologies in the upper troposphere/lower
   stratosphere (UTLS) (300-70hPa) as part of the Stratosphere-troposphere
   Processes and their Role in Climate (SPARC) Data Initiative. The
   Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer (TES) instrument is the only
   nadir-viewing instrument in this initiative, as well as the only
   instrument with a focus on tropospheric composition. We apply the TES
   observational operator to ozone climatologies from the more highly
   vertically resolved limb-viewing instruments. This minimizes the impact
   of differences in vertical resolution among the instruments and allows
   identification of systematic differences in the large-scale structure
   and variability of UTLS ozone. We find that the climatologies from most
   of the limb-viewing instruments show positive differences (ranging from
   5 to 75\%) with respect to TES in the tropical UTLS, and comparison to a
   zonal mean ozonesonde climatology indicates that these differences
   likely represent a positive bias for p100hPa. In the extratropics, there
   is good agreement among the climatologies regarding the timing and
   magnitude of the ozone seasonal cycle (differences in the peak-to-peak
   amplitude of <15\%) when the TES observational operator is applied, as
   well as very consistent midlatitude interannual variability. The
   discrepancies in ozone temporal variability are larger in the tropics,
   with differences between the data sets of up to 55\% in the seasonal
   cycle amplitude. However, the differences among the climatologies are
   everywhere much smaller than the range produced by current
   chemistry-climate models, indicating that the multiple-instrument
   ensemble is useful for quantitatively evaluating these models.}},

Abstract = {{Two column-type bioelectrochemical system (BES) modules were installed
   into a 50-L pilot scale reactor packed with diesel-contaminated soils to
   investigate the enhancement of passive biodegradation of petroleum
   compounds. By using low cost electrodes such as biochar and graphite
   granule as non-exhaustible solid-state electron acceptors, the results
   show that 82.1-89.7\% of the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) was
   degraded after 120 days across 1-34 cm radius of influence (ROI) from
   the modules. This represents a maximum of 241\% increase of
   biodegradation compared to a baseline control reactor. The current
   production in the BESs correlated with the TPH removal, reaching the
   maximum output of 70.4 +/- 0.2 mA/m(2). The maximum ROI of the BES,
   deducting influence from the baseline natural attenuation, was estimated
   to be more than 90 cm beyond the edge of the reactor (34 cm), and exceed
   300 cm should a non-degradation baseline be used. The ratio of the
   projected ROI to the radius of BES (ROB) module was 11-12. The results
   suggest that this BES can serve as an innovative and sustainable
   technology for enhanced in situ bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons
   in large field scale, with additional benefits of electricity production
   and being integrated into existing field infrastructures. (C) 2014

Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{The current performance-based seismic assessment procedure can be
   computationally intensive as it requires a large number of time history
   analyses (THA) each requiring time intensive post-processing of results.
   This study proposes the endurance time analysis (ETA) method as an
   alternative method to THA and incremental dynamic analysis (IDA). ETA is
   a time history based dynamic pushover procedure that applies a set of
   gradually intensifying acceleration functions to the structure and
   monitors the performance of the building accordingly. In this paper, the
   application of ETA in the seismic assessment of multistory steel
   concentrically braced frames is compared with THA and IDA methods.
   Moreover, the progressive failure of the frames is investigated using
   the ETA method. The results of this analysis show that ETA can estimate
   THA as well as IDA, with considerably less computational effort. (C)

Title = {{Mechanisms of water supply and vegetation demand govern the seasonality

Volume = {{191}},

Abstract = {{Evapotranspiration (E) in the Amazon connects forest function and
   regional climate via its role in precipitation recycling However, the
   mechanisms regulating water supply to vegetation and its demand for
   water remain poorly understood, especially during periods of seasonal
   water deficits In this study, we address two main questions: First, how
   do mechanisms of water supply (indicated by rooting depth and
   groundwater) and vegetation water demand (indicated by stomatal
   conductance and intrinsic water use efficiency) control
   evapotranspiration (E) along broad gradients of climate and vegetation
   from equatorial Amazonia to Cerrado, and second, how do these inferred
   mechanisms of supply and demand compare to those employed by a suite of
   ecosystem models? We used a network of eddy covariance towers in Brazil
   coupled with ancillary measurements to address these questions With
   respect to the magnitude and seasonality of E, models have much improved
   in equatorial tropical forests by eliminating most dry season water
   limitation, diverge in performance in transitional forests where
   seasonal water deficits are greater, and mostly capture the observed
   seasonal depressions in E at Cerrado However, many models depended
   universally on either deep roots or groundwater to mitigate dry season
   water deficits, the relative importance of which we found does not vary
   as a simple function of climate or vegetation In addition, canopy
   stomatal conductance (g's) regulates dry season vegetation demand for
   water at all except the wettest sites even as the seasonal cycle of E
   follows that of net radiation In contrast, some models simulated no
   seasonality in gs, even while matching the observed seasonal cycle of E.
   We suggest that canopy dynamics mediated by leaf phenology may play a
   significant role in such seasonality, a process poorly represented in
   models Model bias in gs and E, in turn, was related to biases arising
   from the simulated light response (gross primary productivity, GPP) or
   the intringic water use efficiency of photosynthesis (iWUE). We
   identified deficiencies in models which would not otherwise be apparent
   based on a simple comparison of simulated and observed rates of E. While
   some deficiencies can be remedied by parameter tuning, in most models
   they highlight the need for continued process development of belowground
   hydrology and in particular, the biological processes of root dynamics
   and leaf phenology, which via their controls on E, mediate
   vegetation-climate feedbacks in the tropics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This work proposes a method for sparse polynomial chaos (PC)
   approximation of high-dimensional stochastic functions based on
   non-adapted random sampling. We modify the standard l(1)-minimization
   algorithm, originally proposed in the context of compressive sampling,
   using a priori information about the decay of the PC coefficients, when
   available, and refer to the resulting algorithm as weighted
   l(1)-minimization. We provide conditions under which we may guarantee
   recovery using this weighted scheme. Numerical tests are used to compare
   the weighted and non-weighted methods for the recovery of solutions to
   two differential equations with high-dimensional random inputs: a
   boundary value problem with a random elliptic operator and a 2-D
   thermally driven cavity flow with random boundary condition. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to explore the thermodynamic conditions
   necessary to condense aqueous suspensions of lipid-coated gas-filled
   microbubbles into metastable liquid-filled nanodrops as well as the
   physicochemical mechanisms involved with this process. Individual
   perfluorobutane microbubbles and their lipid shells were observed as
   they were pressurized at 34.5 kPa s(-1) in a microscopic viewing chamber
   maintained at temperatures ranging from 5 to 75 degrees C. The
   microbubbles contracted under pressure, ultimately leading to either
   full dissolution or microbubble-to-nanodrop condensation. Temperature-
   pressure phase diagrams conveying condensation and stability transitions
   were constructed for microbubbles coated with saturated
   diacylphosphatidylcholine lipids of varying acyl chain length (C16 to
   C24). The onset of full dissolution was shifted to higher temperatures
   with the use of longer acyl chain lipids or supersaturated media. Longer
   chain lipid shells resisted both dissolution of the gas core and
   mechanical compression through a pronounced wrinkle-to-fold collapse
   transition. Interestingly, the lipid shell also provided a mechanical
   resistance to condensation, shifting the vapor-to-liquid transition to
   higher pressures than for bulk perfluorobutane. This result indicated
   that the lipid shell can provide a negative apparent surface tension
   under compression. Overall, the results of this study will aid in the
   design and formulation of vaporizable fluorocarbon nanodrops for various
   applications, such as diagnostic ultrasound imaging, targeted drug
   delivery, and thermal ablation.}},

Abstract = {{Charged-pion-interferometry measurements were made with respect to the
   second-and third-order event plane for Au + Au collisions at root S-NN =
   200 GeV. A strong azimuthal-angle dependence of the extracted
   Gaussian-source radii was observed with respect to both the second-and
   third-order event planes. The results for the second-order dependence
   indicate that the initial eccentricity is reduced during the medium
   evolution, which is consistent with previous results. In contrast, the
   results for the third-order dependence indicate that the initial
   triangular shape is significantly reduced and potentially reversed by
   the end of the medium evolution, and that the third-order oscillations
   are largely dominated by the dynamical effects from triangular flow.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal crystals belong to a new class of materials with unusual
   properties in which the big challenge is to grow large-scale structures
   of a given symmetry in a well-controlled and inexpensive way. Recently,
   template-assisted crystallization was successfully exploited
   experimentally in the case of colloidal particles dispersed in isotropic
   fluids. In liquid crystal (LC) colloids, particles are subjected to
   long-range anisotropic elastic forces originating from the anisotropic
   deformation of the underlying order parameter. These effective
   interactions are easily tunable by external electric or magnetic fields,
   light, temperature, or confinement and, thus, provide additional handles
   for better control of colloidal assembly. Here we use the coupling
   between microsculptured bounding surfaces and LC elasticity in order to
   guide the self-assembly of large-scale colloidal structures. We present
   explicit numerical calculations of the free energy landscape of
   colloidal particles in the presence of convex protrusions modeled as
   squared pyramids comparable to the size of the particles. We show the
   existence of strong trapping potentials that are able to efficiently
   localize the colloidal particles and withstand thermal fluctuations.
   Three-dimensional optical imaging experiments support the theoretical
   predictions.}},

   mm) and 0.6 in. (15 mm) diameter monostrand-anchor systems to fracture
   of all wires. All monostrands were Grade 270 (1860 MPa), cold-drawn,
   seven-wire, low-relaxation cables. Major findings of this experimental
   study include the following: premature failure of monostrand-anchor
   systems (for strains in the range of 1.5\% to 4\%) in the form of
   fracture of a single wire; successive fracture of monostrand wires (one
   at a time) with the applied extension, as opposed to the nearly
   simultaneous fracture of all wires in anchor-free monostrands; and
   differences between the loading and unloading/reloading stiffness of
   monostrand-anchor systems due to the seating and sliding of the wedges
   of the anchorage hardware. A numerical model was developed that is
   capable of capturing the basic characteristics of the observed
   experimental response. The numerical results are in good agreement with
   the experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the application of Endurance Time Analysis (ETA)
   method is investigated on seismic analysis of a high arch dam. In this
   method the coupled system is excited using the predesigned intensifying
   acceleration functions instead of the real ground motions. Finite
   element model of an arch dam considering the dam-rock-water interaction
   effects was developed in which the concrete and rock were assumed to
   have linear elastic behavior. The effect of the large displacement in
   dam body was considered in numerical model using co-rotational approach.
   The coupled system was analyzed by conventional Time History Analysis
   (THA) method in various seismic performance levels and the results were
   compared with those obtained from ETA at the equivalent target time. It
   was found that ETA method provides the close results to THA with
   acceptable accuracy while it reduces the total time of the analyses
   considerably.}},

Abstract = {{The ratio of key elements such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and silica
   determines nutrient limitations that are important to regulating primary
   productivity and species composition in aquatic ecosystems. The flux of
   these nutrients in streams, as dissolved constituents or as particulate
   matter, is sensitive to variability in flow conditions. Most previous
   research on nutrient flux and hydrologic variability has focused on the
   response of individual elements, especially nitrogen, to changes in flow
   over time. This study examines how the ratios of total nitrogen to total
   phosphorus (N:P) and total nitrogen to dissolved silica (N: Si) respond
   to hydrologic variability in the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin. A
   doubling of the discharge by the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers to
   the Gulf of Mexico is found to increase the N: P by 10\% and the N: Si
   by 4\%. Analysis of data from upstream stations indicates that the N: P
   increases with discharge in subbasins with intensive row crop
   agriculture and high fertilizer application rates but is less
   predictable in other subbasins. Conversely, the response of N: Si to
   discharge does not vary predictably with the land use characteristics of
   the subbasin. The response of the nutrient ratios to variability in flow
   may be linked to the different sources and sinks of each nutrient, as
   well as the difference between the dominant transport pathways of each
   nutrient. High-resolution data and models that describe the dissolved
   and particulate nutrient cycling are needed to assess the relative
   contribution of different drivers to these observed patterns and to
   identify the response of nutrient ratios to hydrologic variability under
   future land use and climate change.}},

Abstract = {{The central component of the CMS detector is the largest silicon tracker
   ever built. The precise alignment of this complex device is a formidable
   challenge, and only achievable with a significant extension of the
   technologies routinely used for tracking detectors in the past. This
   article describes the full-scale alignment procedure as it is used
   during LHC operations. Among the specific features of the method are the
   simultaneous determination of up to 200 000 alignment parameters with
   tracks, the measurement of individual sensor curvature parameters, the
   control of systematic misalignment effects, and the implementation of
   the whole procedure in a multiprocessor environment for high execution
   speed. Overall, the achieved statistical accuracy on the module
   alignment is found to be significantly better than 10 mu m.}},

Title = {{Navigating financial and supply reliability tradeoffs in regional

Abstract = {{Rising development costs and growing concerns over environmental impacts
   have led many communities to explore more diversified water management
   strategies. These ``portfolio''-style approaches integrate existing
   supply infrastructure with other options such as conservation measures
   or water transfers. Diversified water supply portfolios have been shown
   to reduce the capacity and costs required to meet demand, while also
   providing greater adaptability to changing hydrologic conditions.
   However, this additional flexibility can also cause unexpected
   reductions in revenue (from conservation) or increased costs (from
   transfers). The resulting financial instability can act as a substantial
   disincentive to utilities seeking to implement more innovative water
   management techniques. This study seeks to design portfolios that employ
   financial tools (e. g., contingency funds and index insurance) to reduce
   fluctuations in revenues and costs, allowing these strategies to achieve
   improved performance without sacrificing financial stability. This
   analysis is applied to the development of coordinated regional supply
   portfolios in the ``Research Triangle'' region of North Carolina, an
   area comprising four rapidly growing municipalities. The actions of each
   independent utility become interconnected when shared infrastructure is
   utilized to enable interutility transfers, requiring the evaluation of
   regional tradeoffs in up to five performance and financial objectives.
   Diversified strategies introduce significant tradeoffs between achieving
   reliability goals and introducing burdensome variability in annual
   revenues and/or costs. Financial mitigation tools can mitigate the
   impacts of this variability, allowing for an alternative suite of
   improved solutions. This analysis provides a general template for
   utilities seeking to navigate the tradeoffs associated with more
   flexible, portfolio-style management approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Space missions necessitate physiological and psychological adaptations
   to environmental factors not present on Earth, some of which present
   significant risks for the central nervous system (CNS) of crewmembers.
   One CNS region of interest is the adult olfactory bulb (OB), as OB
   structure and function are sensitive to environmental- and
   experience-induced regulation. It is currently unknown how the OB is
   altered by spaceflight. In this study, we evaluated OB volume and
   neurogenesis in mice shortly after a 13-day flight on Space Shuttle
   Atlantis {[}Space Transport System (STS)-135] relative to two groups of
   control mice maintained on Earth. Mice housed on Earth in animal
   enclosure modules that mimicked the conditions onboard STS-135
   (AEM-Ground mice) had greater OB volume relative to mice maintained in
   standard housing on Earth (Vivarium mice), particularly in the granule
   (GCL) and glomerular (GL) cell layers. AEM-Ground mice also had more OB
   neuroblasts and fewer apoptotic cells relative to Vivarium mice.
   However, the AEM-induced increase in OB volume and neurogenesis was not
   seen in STS-135 mice (AEM-Flight mice), suggesting that spaceflight may
   have negated the positive effects of the AEM. In fact, when OB volume of
   AEM-Flight mice was considered, there was a greater density of apoptotic
   cells relative to AEM-Ground mice. Our findings suggest that factors
   present during spaceflight have opposing effects on OB size and
   neurogenesis, and provide insight into potential strategies to preserve
   OB structure and function during future space missions.}},

   rotation. Averaging conditions for these cases are given. As a major
   extension, a few classes of near resonant orbits are analyzed by the
   averaging method. Then some resulted conclusions of these averaging
   analyses are applied to understand the stability regions in a numerical

Abstract = {{Graphene sheets are extremely flexible, and thus small forces, such as
   van der Waals interaction, can induce significant out-of-plane
   deformation, such as folding. Folded graphene sheets show racket shaped
   edges, which can significantly affect the electrical properties of
   graphene. In this paper, we present combined theoretical and

   graphene sheets. A nonlinear theoretical model is established to
   determine the critical length of multilayer graphene sheets for
   metastable and stable folding, and to accurately predict the shapes of
   folded edges. These results all show good agreement with those obtained

   spatio-temporally varying wavelet thresholding}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{749}},
Pages = {{794-817}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A new framework for spatio-temporally adaptive turbulence simulations is
   proposed. The method is based on a variable-fidelity representation that
   tightly integrates numerics and modelling of subgrid-scale turbulence
   and aims to capture the flow physics on a near-optimal adaptive mesh.
   The integration is achieved by combining hierarchical wavelet-based
   computational modelling with spatially and temporally varying wavelet
   threshold filtering. The proposed approach provides automatic smooth
   transition from directly resolving all flow physics to capturing only
   the energetic/coherent structures, which leads to a dynamically adaptive
   variable-fidelity approach. The self-regulating continuous switch
   between different fidelity regimes is accomplished through a two-way
   feedback mechanism between the modelled dissipation and the local grid
   resolution, which is based on spatio-temporal variation of the wavelet
   filtering threshold. The proposed methodology systematically accounts
   for and exploits the spatial and temporal intermittency of turbulence.
   Thus, it overcomes the major limitation of all existing wavelet-based
   multi-resolution techniques, namely, the use of a global thresholding
   criterion. The procedure consists of tracking the wavelet thresholding
   factor within a Lagrangian frame by exploiting a Lagrangian path-line
   diffusive averaging approach, based on either interpolation along
   characteristics or direct solution of the corresponding evolution
   equation. This new methodology is tested for linearly forced homogeneous
   turbulence at different Reynolds numbers and provides very promising
   results on a benchmark with time-varying prescribed level of turbulence
   resolution.}},

Abstract = {{The prominence of receptor-mediated bilayer fusion in cellular biology
   motivates development of biomimetic strategies for studying fusogenic
   mechanisms. An approach is reported here for monitoring
   receptor-mediated fusion that exploits the unique physical and optical
   properties of liquid crystals (LC). PEG-functionalized lipids are used
   to create an interfacial environment capable of inhibiting spontaneous
   liposome fusion with an aqueous/LC interface. Then, DNA hybridization
   between oligonucleotides within bulk phase liposomes and a PEG-lipid
   monolayer at an aqueous/LC interface is exploited to induce
   receptor-mediated liposome fusion. These hybridization events induce
   strain within the liposome bilayer, promote lipid mixing with the LC
   interface, and consequently create an interfacial environment favoring
   re-orientation of the LC to a homeotropic (perpendicular) state.
   Furthermore, the bi-functionality of aptamers is exploited to modulate
   DNA hybridization-mediated liposome fusion by regulating the
   availability of the appropriate ligand (i.e., thrombin). Here, a
   LC-based approach for monitoring receptor (i.e., DNA
   hybridization)-mediated liposome fusion is demonstrated, liposome
   properties that dictate fusion dynamics are explored, and an example of
   how this approach may be used in a biosensing scheme is provided.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of the two Jupiter triangular libration points perturbed by
   Saturn is studied in this paper. Unlike some previous works that studied
   the same problem via the pure numerical approach, this study is done in
   a semianalytic way. Using a literal solution, we are able to explain the
   asymmetry of two orbits around the two libration points with symmetric
   initial conditions. The literal solution consists of many frequencies.
   The amplitudes of each frequency are the same for both libration points,
   but the initial phase angles are different. This difference causes a
   temporary spatial asymmetry in the motions around the two points, but
   this asymmetry gradually disappears when the time goes to infinity. The
   results show that the two Jupiter triangular libration points should
   have symmetric spatial stable regions in the present status of Jupiter
   and Saturn. As a test of the literal solution, we study the resonances
   that have been extensively studied in Robutel and Gabern (Mon Not R
   Astron Soc 372:1463-1482, 2006). The resonance structures predicted by
   our analytic theory agree well with those found in Robutel and Gabern
   (Mon Not R Astron Soc 372:1463-1482, 2006) via a numerical approach. Two
   kinds of chaotic orbits are discussed. They have different behaviors in
   the frequency map. The first kind of chaotic orbits (inner chaotic
   orbits) is of small to moderate amplitudes, while the second kind of
   chaotic orbits (outer chaotic orbits) is of relatively larger
   amplitudes. Using analytical theory, we qualitatively explain the
   transition process from the inner chaotic orbits to the outer chaotic
   orbits with increasing amplitudes. A critical value of the diffusion
   rate is given to separate them in the frequency map. In a forthcoming
   paper, we will study the same problem but keep the planets in migration.
   The time asymmetry, which is unimportant in this paper, may cause an
   observable difference in the two Jupiter Trojan groups during a very
   fast planet migration process.}},

Abstract = {{Wake effects of a horizontal-axis wind-turbine blade on aeroelastic
   characteristics were investigated under normal operational conditions. A
   structural analysis was performed employing a nonlinear beam model based
   on the large deflection beam theory. For inflow analysis on rotor
   blades, a free-vortex wake method was employed. An advantage of the
   present approach is its ability to calculate directly the induced
   velocities from the wake. Also, for the predictions of aerodynamic
   loads, a fully turbulent flow solution is invoked in FLUENT, where the
   k-omega SST turbulent model of two-dimensional airfoils is adopted for
   transient analysis. To verify and validate the aerodynamic model for
   wind turbines, the wake geometry and the aerodynamic coefficients from
   the present simulation are compared with measurements and numerical
   results of previous studies. Finally, an analysis of the tightly coupled
   fluid-structure interaction phenomena of a wind-turbine blade has been
   carried out to investigate aeroelastic characteristics, such as
   steady-state blade deflections and dynamic stability. The present
   results are compared with the numerical results obtained using a uniform
   inflow model, which clearly confirms the importance of wake effects on
   the blade aeroelastic characteristics.}},

Title = {{Pile and pile group response to tunnelling using a large diameter slurry
   shield - Case study in Shanghai}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{21-43}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The study investigates the disturbance to piles and pile groups caused
   by multiple nearby drives of a large diameter slurry shield-driven
   tunnelling machine in Shanghai. The minimum distance between the slurry
   shield tunnel (with diameter D = 15.43 m) and the adjacent pile groups
   of Metro Line 3 and Yixian Elevated Road is 1 m. The nonlinear finite
   element (FE) software program ABAQUS was used to analyse the movement of
   the pile groups caused by the process of shield tunnelling. A field
   investigation was conducted before the multiple crossings to study the
   impact (movement and excess pore water pressure) on the surrounding soil
   and piles caused by the tunnelling process. The field investigation is
   divided into two sections: (i) free-field tunnelling, and (ii)
   tunnelling close to trial piles pre-installed in the section. For the
   full-scale test, tunnelling variable, including slurry pressure and
   grouting pressure, are adjusted during construction to reduce the
   disturbance during tunnelling close to pile groups supporting two
   elevated bridges. The FE simulation of the multiple crossings includes
   two steps: (a) shield tunnelling along the south bound tunnel
   approaching the working shaft at the western bank of the Huangpu River,
   and passing separately between two adjacent pile groups of each bridge;
   (b) return tunnel passing again between the pile groups of the two
   bridges along the north bound tunnel. Three different FE models are
   generated: (1) free-field tunnelling process, (2) tunnelling close to
   trial piles, and (3) multiple tunnel passes adjacent to pile groups
   supporting the two elevated bridges. Most of the relevant factors in
   tunnelling are taken into consideration in the FE models including (a)
   slurry pressure, (b) grouting pressure, (c) grouting material hardening,
   and (d) soil-pile interaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Despite the fundamental role oxygen vacancy formation energies play in a
   broad range of important energy applications, their relationships with
   the intrinsic bulk properties of solid oxides remain elusive. Our study
   of oxygen vacancy formation in La1-xSrxBO3 perovskites (B=Cr, Mn, Fe,
   Co, and Ni) conducted using modern, electronic structure theory and
   solid-state defect models demonstrates that a combination of two
   fundamental and intrinsic materials properties, the oxide enthalpy of
   formation and the minimum band gap energy, accurately correlate with
   oxygen vacancy formation energies. The energy to form a single, neutral
   oxygen vacancy decreases with both the oxide enthalpy of formation and
   the band gap energy in agreement with the relation of the former to
   metal-oxygen bond strengths and of the latter to the energy of the
   oxygen vacancy electron density redistribution. These findings extend
   our understanding of the nature of oxygen vacancy formation in complex
   oxides and provide a fundamental method for predicting oxygen vacancy
   formation energies using purely intrinsic bulk properties.}},

   culture polystyrene (TCPS; E similar to 3 GPa). In addition, mechanical
   dosing of hMSCs cultured on initially stiff (E similar to 10 kPa) and
   then soft (E similar to 2 kPa) phototunable PEG hydrogels resulted in
   either reversible or-above a threshold mechanical dose-irreversible
   activation of YAP/TAZ and RUNX2. We also found that increased mechanical
   dosing on supraphysiologically stiff TCPS biases hMSCs towards
   osteogenic differentiation. We conclude that stem cells possess
   mechanical memory-with YAP/TAZ acting as an intracellular mechanical
   rheostat-that stores information from past physical environments and
   influences the cells' fate.}},

Abstract = {{Liquefaction or cyclic softening from earthquake shaking have caused
   significant damage of buildings with shallow foundations. In recent
   earthquakes, buildings have punched into, tilted excessively, and slid
   laterally on liquefied/softened ground. The state-of-the-practice still
   largely involves estimating building settlement using empirical
   procedures developed to calculate post-liquefaction, one-dimensional,
   consolidation settlement in the ``free-field{''} away from buildings.
   Performance-based earthquake engineering requires improved procedures,
   because these free-field analyses cannot possibly capture shear-induced
   and localized volumetric-induced deformations in the soil underneath
   shallow foundations. Recent physical and numerical modeling has provided
   useful insights into this problem. Centrifuge tests revealed that much
   of the building movement occurs during earthquake strong shaking, and
   its rate is dependent on the shaking intensity rate. Additionally, shear
   strains due to shaking-induced ratcheting of the buildings into the
   softened soil and volumetric strains due to localized drainage in
   response to high transient hydraulic gradients are important effects
   that are not captured in current procedures. Nonlinear effective stress
   analyses can capture the soil and building responses reasonably well and
   provide valuable insights. Based on these studies, recommendations for
   estimating liquefaction-induced movements of buildings with shallow
   foundations are made.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of therapeutic proteins formulated in prefilled syringes
   (PFS) may be negatively impacted by the exposure of protein molecules to
   silicone oil-water interfaces and air-water interfaces. In addition,
   agitation, such as that experienced during transportation, may increase
   the detrimental effects (i.e., protein aggregation and particle
   formation) of protein interactions with interfaces. In this study,
   surfactant-free formulations containing either a monoclonal antibody or
   lysozyme were incubated in PFS, where they were exposed to silicone
   oil-water interfaces (siliconized syringe walls), air-water interfaces
   (air bubbles), and agitation stress (occurring during end-over-end
   rotation). Using flow microscopy, particles (2 m diameter) were detected
   under all conditions. The highest particle concentrations were found in
   agitated, siliconized syringes containing an air bubble. The particles
   formed in this condition consisted of silicone oil droplets and
   aggregated protein, as well as agglomerates of protein aggregates and
   silicone oil. We propose an interfacial mechanism of particle generation
   in PFS in which capillary forces at the three-phase (silicone
   oil-water-air) contact line remove silicone oil and gelled protein
   aggregates from the interface and transport them into the bulk. This
   mechanism explains the synergistic effects of silicone oil-water
   interfaces, air-water interfaces, and agitation in the generation of
   particles in protein formulations. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and

Volume = {{274}},

Abstract = {{This work is concerned with the propagation of uncertainty across
   coupled domain problems with high-dimensional random inputs. A
   stochastic model reduction approach based on low-rank separated
   representations is proposed for the partitioned treatment of the
   uncertainty space. The construction of the coupled domain solution is
   achieved though a sequence of approximations with respect to the
   dimensionality of the random inputs associated with each individual
   sub-domain and not the combined dimensionality, hence drastically
   reducing the overall computational cost. The coupling between the
   sub-domain solutions is done via the classical finite element tearing
   and interconnecting (FETI) method, thus providing a well suited
   framework for parallel computing. Two high-dimensional stochastic
   problems, a 2D elliptic PDE with random diffusion coefficient and a
   stochastic linear elasticity problem, have been considered to study the
   performance and accuracy of the proposed stochastic coupling approach.

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel precast concrete segmental bridge system is
   introduced and experimentally investigated. The system consists of
   segmental members incorporating hybrid sliding-rocking (HSR) joints and
   internal unbonded posttensioning (PT). The HSR joints are plane
   interfaces that are oriented normal to the member axis and do not
   include shear keys or epoxy adhesives. The HSR joints are designed to
   exhibit sliding (slip-dominant, SD) or rocking (rocking-dominant, RD) to
   mitigate the applied seismic loading and reduce damage. The joint
   response is affected by the PT system, which can include straight or
   curved tendons. Two types of HSR members are developed and investigated:
   (1)members with SD joints and straight tendons, intended for
   substructure columns (HSR-SD columns), and (2)members with RD joints and
   curved tendons, intended for superstructure girders (HSR-RD girders).
   The SD joints are shown to offer energy dissipation with low damage
   through sliding in addition to moderate self-centering. The RD joints,
   albeit offering low energy dissipation, are shown to provide high
   self-centering. A series of shake table tests on a large-scale bridge
   specimen demonstrates the successful integrated response of the HSR-SD
   substructure and the HSR-RD superstructure for intense horizontal and
   vertical seismic excitations.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of DNA damage reversal during medium-pressure UV disinfection}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{181-189}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Ultraviolet (UV) disinfection relies on the principal that DNA exposure
   to UV irradiation leads to the formation of cytotoxic lesions resulting
   in the inactivation of microorganisms. Cyclobutane pyrimdine dimers
   (CPDs) account for the majority of DNA lesions upon UV exposure. Past
   research has demonstrated reversal of CPDs in extracted DNA formed at
   high UV-C wavelength irradiation (280 nm) upon subsequent irradiation at
   lower UVC wavelengths (230-240 nm). Medium-pressure (MP) UV lamps
   produce a polychromatic emission giving rise to the possibility that
   cellular DNA in a target pathogen may undergo simultaneous damage and
   repair when exposed to multiple wavelengths during the disinfection
   process, decreasing the efficiency of MP UV lamp disinfection. Culture
   techniques and a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay
   were used to examine cell viability and DNA damage reversal. qPCR
   results indicated direct photoreversal of UV-induced DNA damage through
   sequential irradiations of 280 nm followed by 228 nm in Escherichia coli
   DNA. However, significant photoreversal was only observed after high
   initial doses and secondary doses of UV light. The doses where
   significant photoreversal took place were more than 10 times higher than
   those typically used in UV disinfection. Despite evidence of CPD
   photoreversal, bacterial growth assays showed no indication that
   sequential-wavelength irradiations result in higher survival rates than
   single-wavelength irradiations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The reciprocity law concerning light dose relationships applied to

   characterization}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Objectives. A model BisGMA/TEGDMA unfilled resin was utilized to
   investigate the effect of varied irradiation intensity on the
   photopolymerization kinetics and shrinkage stress evolution, as a means
   for evaluation of the reciprocity relationship.
   Methods. Functional group conversion was determined by FTIR spectroscopy
   and polymerization shrinkage stress was obtained by a tensometer.
   Samples were polymerized with UV light from an EXFO Acticure with 0.1
   wt\% photoinitiator. A one-dimensional kinetic model was utilized to
   predict the conversion-dose relationship.
   Results. As irradiation intensity increased, conversion decreased at a
   constant irradiation dose and the overall dose required to achieve full
   conversion increased. Methacrylate conversion ranged from 64 +/- 2\% at
   3 mW/cm(2) to 78 +/- 1\% at 24 mW/cm(2) while the final shrinkage stress
   varied from 2.4 +/- 0.1 MPa to 3.0 +/- 0.1 MPa. The ultimate conversion
   and shrinkage stress levels achieved were dependent not only upon dose
   but also the irradiation intensity, in contrast to an idealized
   reciprocity relationship. A kinetic model was utilized to analyze this
   behavior and provide theoretical conversion profiles versus irradiation
   time and dose.
   Significance. Analysis of the experimental and modeling results
   demonstrated that the polymerization kinetics do not and should not be
   expected to follow the reciprocity law behavior. As irradiation
   intensity is increased, the overall dose required to achieve full
   conversion also increased. Further, the ultimate conversion and
   shrinkage stress that are achieved are not dependent only upon dose but
   rather upon the irradiation intensity and corresponding polymerization
   rate. (C) 2014 Academy of Dental Materials. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The Colorado Coarse Rural-Urban Sources and Health (CCRUSH) study is a
   multi-year study focused on characterizing the mass, composition and
   sources of coarse particulate matter (PM10-2.5) in Denver and Greeley,
   CO. Between the two cities, Denver is expected to have greater influence
   of industry and motor vehicles as sources of PM10-2.5. Greeley is a
   smaller city with greater expected influence of agricultural activity.
   As part of the CCRUSH study, we collected integrated 24-h samples of PM
   from four sites in Denver and Greeley at six day intervals from February
   2010 to March 2011. Dichotomous samplers with Teflon filters were used
   to obtain samples for gravimetric and elemental analysis. Magnetic
   Sector Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (SF-ICP-MS) was used
   to analyze digests of monthly composited filter samples for 49 elements.
   Thirty-nine elements were retained for statistical analysis after
   excluding those with low signal-to-noise ratios. The elements Sb, Cd,
   Zn, Mo, As, B, Cu, Pb, and W had crustal enrichment factors greater than
   10 in the PM2.5 and PM10-2.5 size ranges in both Denver and Greeley.
   Using positive matrix factorization (PMF) with bootstrap uncertainty
   estimation, we identified five factors influencing the element
   concentrations: a crustal factor contributing to both PM2.5 and
   PM10-2.5; a sodium-dominated PM10-2.5 factor likely associated with road
   salt; a vehicle abrasion factor contributing in both size ranges; a
   regional sulfur factor contributing mainly to PM2.5 and likely
   associated with coal combustion; and a local catalyst factor identified
   with high Ce and La enrichment in PM2.5 at one of the sites in Denver.

Title = {{Investigating the sensitivity of surface-level nitrate seasonality in
   Antarctica to primary sources using a global model}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Pages = {{757-767}},

Abstract = {{Determining the sources of total nitrate (TNIT  NO3- + HNO3) reaching
   Antarctica is a long-standing challenge. Here we analyze the monthly
   sensitivity of surface-level TNIT in Antarctica to primary sources using
   a global 3-D chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, and its adjoint
   Modeled seasonal variation of TNIT concentrations shows good agreement
   with several measurement studies, given that the lack of
   post-depositional processing in the model leads to an expected
   underestimate of maximum values in November through January. Remote NOx
   sources have the greatest impact May July, during when the model
   background concentrations are sensitive to NOx emissions from fossil
   fuel combustion, soil, and lightning originating from 25 degrees S to 65
   degrees S. In this season, NOx is transported to Antarctica as TNIT,
   which is formed above continental source regions at an altitude of 5-11
   km. In other seasons, more NOx is transported as a reservoir species
   (e.g., peroxyacetyl nitrate, PAN) through the free troposphere,
   transforming into TNIT within a cone of influence that extends to 35
   degrees S and above 4 km altitude. Photolysis of PAN over Antarctica is
   the main driver of modeled NOx seasonality. Stratospheric production and
   loss of tracers are relatively unimportant in monthly sensitivities in
   GEOS-Chem, driving only a few percent of surface level variability of
   TNIT. A small peak concentration in August is captured by the model,
   although some measured values in August fall outside the range of
   simulated concentrations. Modifications to the model to represent
   sedimentation of polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) lead to increased
   surface level August TNIT concentrations. However, this simple
   representation does not explicitly account for PSC particle deposition
   or disappearance of the tropopause in the middle of winter, and thus the
   influence of stratospheric nitrate sources estimated in this study is
   likely a lower bound. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the design process for engineering structures, it is often of
   interest to determine the largest magnitude of a given form of load that
   can be applied on a structure before causing failure. This gives the
   factor of safety against failure. Determining the factor of safety
   entails analysis of a structure on the verge of failure, and is known as
   limit analysis. It is well known that limit analysis can be formulated
   as a constrained optimization problem. With robust computational tools
   for optimization having become readily available, it is possible to
   introduce the optimization-based approach to limit analysis at various
   stages in the undergraduate civil engineering curriculum. In this
   article, we present three instances of limit analysis using an
   optimization-based approach from (i) a sophomore level Statics course,
   (ii) a junior level Structural Analysis course, and (iii) a senior level
   Advanced Solid Mechanics course. These are based on materials presented
   by the author in undergraduate mechanics courses at the University of
   Colorado at Boulder. In each case, we develop a mathematical formulation
   and implement the computations in MATLAB. We use two optimization tools,
   one from the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox and the other called SeDuMi.
   Classroom experience has shown that the optimization-based approach
   helps students recognize the underlying thread in seemingly disparate
   limit analysis problems. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Comput Appl

   Media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{We present a numerical implementation of an alternative formulation of
   the geometrical, or ray, acoustics, where wavefronts rather than rays
   are the primary objects. Rays are recovered as a by-product of wavefront
   tracing. The alternative formulation of the geometrical acoustics is
   motivated, first, by the observation that wavefronts are often more
   stable than rays at long-range sound propagation, and, second, by a need
   for computationally efficient modeling of high-frequency acoustic fields
   in three-dimensionally inhomogeneous, moving or motionless fluids.
   Wavefronts are found as a finite-difference solution to a system of
   partial differential equations, which is equivalent to the eikonal
   equation and is a direct implementation of the intuitive Huygens'
   wavefront construction. The finite-difference algorithm is an extension
   of the approach originally developed in the framework of an open source
   Madagascar project. Benchmark problems, which admit exact, analytic
   solutions of the eikonal equation, are formulated and utilized to verify
   the finite-difference wavefront tracing algorithm. Huygens' wavefront
   tracing (HWT) is applied to modeling sound propagation in
   three-dimensionally inhomogeneous ocean and atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Interactions between work and identities are an important topic as a
   result of their influence on both employees' well-being and
   organizational performance. However, there is a lack of theorizing that
   comprehensively charts the processes and outcomes of work and identity
   interactions. In this paper, we formulate an integrated conceptual model
   of interactions between work and identities, employee reactions to them,
   and subsequent outcomes. In our model, we bring together well-known and
   under-examined aspects of work and identity interactions. The model
   explains how such varied outcomes as employee thriving and withering,
   and both subjugated and empowered identities derive from encounters
   between work and identities. The model makes it possible to assess the
   possible benefits and side-effects of human resource management
   practices that seek to align work with the worker, and supports human
   resource managers in distinguishing the positive potential in situations
   where employees find their work misaligning with their identities. (C)

Abstract = {{Ancient and diverse antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have previously
   been identified from soil(1-3), including genes identical to those in
   human pathogens(4). Despite the apparent overlap between soil and
   clinical resistomes(4-6), factors influencing ARG composition in soil
   and their movement between genomes and habitats remain largely
   unknown(3). General metagenome functions often correlate with the
   underlying structure of bacterial communities(7-12). However, ARGs are
   proposed to be highly mobile(4,5,13), prompting speculation that
   resistomes may not correlate with phylogenetic signatures or ecological
   divisions(13,14). To investigate these relationships, we performed
   functional metagenomic selections for resistance to 18 antibiotics from
   18 agricultural and grassland soils. The 2,895 ARGs we discovered were
   mostly new, and represent all major resistance mechanisms(15). We
   demonstrate that distinct soil types harbour distinct resistomes, and
   that the addition of nitrogen fertilizer strongly influenced soil ARG
   content. Resistome composition also correlated with microbial
   phylogenetic and taxonomic structure, both across and within soil types.
   Consistent with this strong correlation, mobility elements (genes
   responsible for horizontal gene transfer between bacteria such as
   transposases and integrases) syntenic with ARGs were rare in soil by
   comparison with sequenced pathogens, suggesting that ARGs may not
   transfer between soil bacteria as readily as is observed between human
   pathogens. Together, our results indicate that bacterial community
   composition is the primary determinant of soil ARG content, challenging
   previous hypotheses that horizontal gene transfer effectively decouples
   resistomes from phylogeny(13,14).}},

Abstract = {{We present observations of significant dynamics within two UV auroral
   storms observed on Saturn using the Hubble Space Telescope in April/May
   2013. Specifically, we discuss bursts of auroral emission observed at
   the poleward boundary of a solar wind-induced auroral storm, propagating
   at approximate to 330\% rigid corotation from near approximate to 01h LT
   toward approximate to 08h LT. We suggest that these are indicative of
   ongoing, bursty reconnection of lobe flux in the magnetotail, providing
   strong evidence that Saturn's auroral storms are caused by large-scale
   flux closure. We also discuss the later evolution of a similar storm and
   show that the emission maps to the trailing region of an energetic
   neutral atom enhancement. We thus identify the auroral form with the
   upward field-aligned continuity currents flowing into the associated
   partial ring current.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the effect of incubating a monoclonal antibody (mAb) in
   low (0-2.0 M) concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) on the
   protein's conformation and aggregation during isothermal incubation. In
   GdnHCl solutions at concentrations from 1.2 to 1.6 M, the mAb was
   partially unfolded. As demonstrated by fluorescence and circular
   dichroism spectroscopy, the partially unfolded state of the antibody had
   perturbed tertiary structure but retained native secondary structure.
   Furthermore, partial unfolding of the antibody was documented by
   analytical ultracentrifugation, dynamic light scattering, and limited
   proteolysis. Subsequent aggregation of the antibody was characterized
   using size-exclusion chromatography, analytical ultracentrifugation, and
   dynamic light scattering. Over the entire concentration range (0-2.0 M)
   of GdnHCl, protein-protein interactions were attractive, as quantified
   by negative osmotic second virial coefficients measured with static
   light scattering. However, during isothermal incubation at 37 degrees C,
   the aggregation of the antibody was detected only in solutions that
   induced partial unfolding. Differential scanning calorimetry studies
   showed that the antibody's C(H)2 domains were unfolded in antibody
   molecules that had been incubated in 1.2 M and higher concentrations of
   GdnHCl. These results suggest that unfolding of the C(H)2 domains leads
   to aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{A Die Is Alder (DA) network containing dissolved multiacrylate monomers
   is demonstrated as a novel two-stage reactive polymer network, with a
   potential application in self-supporting stereolithography. Initially, a
   thermoreversible Die Is Alder ``scaffold{''} network is formed,
   containing unreacted acrylate monomers and photoinitiator. During
   photopatterning with light at 15 mW/cm(2) from a 365 nm source for 16 s
   of exposure at either ambient temperature or 70 degrees C, both
   acrylates and unreacted maleimides polymerize to form a permanent,
   covalently cross-linked network structure that simultaneously maintains
   the thermoreversible characteristics afforded by the underlying DA
   network. Light exposure of a DA network containing between 25 and 50 wt
   \% acrylate monomer resulted in a sharp increase in cross-link density
   and a 60 degrees C jump in glass transition temperature of the material.
   As a result of the temperature-dependent DA equilibrium, the temperature
   of the film during light exposure has dramatic effects on the resulting
   acrylate conversion (as measured by FT-IR) and mechanical behavior (as
   measured by DMA) of the complex dynamic network structure. For example,
   despite the irreversible acrylate network, the rubbery modulus of the
   material decreases above the glass transition temperature due to the
   presence of the dynamic thermosensitive DA network. The shape of the
   modulus curve was also affected by the ratio of DA monomers to acrylate
   monomers; higher DA monomer content resulted in greater temperature
   sensitivity of the rubbery modulus in light-exposed films. 3D structures
   with feature sizes ranging from 50 to 500 pm were produced in geometries
   such as stacked rectangles and ``logpile{''} structures. In the
   unexposed regions, free acrylate and maleimide groups were shown to
   tolerate temperatures as high as 120 degrees C with no premature gel
   formation observed. Removal of unexposed material during the development
   step was achieved at 120 degrees C, where the Diels-Alder equilibrium
   shifts toward the furan and maleimide reactants and the network
   depolymerizes. Finally, a process was developed for the fabrication of
   3D microstructures via layer-by-layer photopatterning. The process is
   highly repeatable and results in complete elimination of unexposed
   regions. Additionally, excess quantities of the unexposed mixture may be
   stored at 4 degrees C for at least several weeks and then reused by
   heating to 120 degrees C to fully depolymerize the DA network,
   subsequently using the liquid mixture to make films.}},

Title = {{Visible-Light Organic Photocatalysis for Latent Radical-Initiated
   Polymerization via 2e(-)/1H(+) Transfers: Initiation with Parallels to

Abstract = {{We report the latent production of free radicals from energy stored in a
   redox potential through a 2e(-)/1H(+) transfer process, analogous to
   energy harvesting in photosynthesis, using visible-light organic
   photoredox catalysis (photocatalysis) of methylene blue chromophore with
   a sacrificial sterically hindered amine reductant and an onium salt
   oxidant. This enables light-initiated free-radical polymerization to
   continue over extended time intervals (hours) in the dark after brief
   (seconds) low-intensity illumination and beyond the spatial reach of
   light by diffusion of the metastable leucomethylene blue photoproduct.
   The present organic photoredox catalysis system functions via a
   2e(-)/1H(+) shuttle mechanism, as opposed to the 1e(-) transfer process
   typical of organometallic-based and conventional organic multicomponent
   photoinitiator formulations. This prevents immediate formation of
   open-shell (radical) intermediates from the amine upon light absorption
   and enables the ``storage{''} of light-energy without spontaneous
   initiation of the polymerization. Latent energy release and radical
   production are then controlled by the subsequent light-independent
   reaction (analogous to the Calvin cycle) between leuco-methylene blue
   and the onium salt oxidant that is responsible for regeneration of the
   organic methylene blue photocatalyst. This robust approach for
   photocatalysis-based energy harvesting and extended release in the dark
   enables temporally controlled redox initiation of polymer syntheses
   under low-intensity short exposure conditions and permits
   visible-light-mediated synthesis of polymers at least 1 order of
   magnitude thicker than achievable with conventional photoinitiated
   formulations and irradiation regimes.}},

Abstract = {{The current generation of advanced gravitational wave detectors utilize
   titania-doped tantala/silica multilayer stacks for their mirror
   coatings. The properties of the low-refractive-index silica are well
   known; however, in the absence of detailed direct measurements, the
   material parameters of Young's modulus and coefficient of thermal
   expansion (CTE) of the high refractive index material, titania-doped
   tantala, have been assumed to be equal to values measured for pure
   tantala coatings. In order to ascertain the true values necessary for
   thermal noise calculations, we have undertaken measurements of Young's
   modulus and CTE through the use of nanoindentation and thermal-bending
   measurements. The measurements were designed to assess the effects of
   titania-doping concentration and postdeposition heat-treatment on the
   measured values in order to evaluate the possibility of optimizing
   material parameters to further improve thermal noise in the detector.
   Young's modulus measurements on pure tantala and 25\% and 55\%
   titania-doped tantala show a wide range of values, from 132 to 177 GPa,
   which are dependent on both titania concentration and heat-treatment.
   Measurements of CTE give values of (3.9 +/- 0.1) x 10(-6) K-1 and (4.9
   +/- 0.3) x 10(-6) K-1 for 25\% and 55\% titania-doped tantala,
   respectively, without dependence on post-deposition heat-treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Five concentric atmospheric gravity wave (AGW) events have been
   identified in Polar Mesospheric Cloud (PMC) images of the summer
   mesopause region (similar to 82-84 km) made by the Cloud Imaging and
   Particle Size (CIPS) instrument on board the Aeronomy of Ice in the
   Mesosphere satellite during the Northern Hemisphere 2007 and 2009 PMC
   seasons. The AGWs modulate the PMC albedo, ice water content, and
   particle size, creating concentric ring patterns. On only one occasion
   (13 July 2007), the concentric AGWs in PMCs were aligned with AGWs with
   similar shapes observed in 4.3 mu m radiance in the lower stratosphere,
   as measured by Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS). Coincident AIRS and
   Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer nadir measurements of 8.1
   mu m radiance reveal a region of deep convection in the troposphere
   close to the estimated centers of the AGWs in the stratosphere, strongly
   suggesting that convection is the wave source. The AGWs in CIPS on 13
   July 2007 were similar to 1000 km away from the observed deep
   convection. Three other concentric AGWs in PMCs were 500-1000 km away
   from deep convection in the troposphere, while no convection was
   observed related to the wave on 29 July 2009. We perform a 2-D ray
   tracing study for the AGW event on 13 July 2007. The calculated
   propagation distance is much shorter than the distance between the AGWs
   in PMCs and the observed convection. The 2-D ray tracing study indicates
   that the AGWs in PMCs and in the stratosphere are probably excited by
   different tropospheric convective systems.}},

Abstract = {{High-Q ring resonators with contacts to the waveguide core provide a
   versatile platform for various applications in chip-scale optomechanics,
   thermo-, and electro-optics. We propose and demonstrate azimuthally
   periodic contacted ring resonators based on multi-mode Bloch matching
   that support contacts on both the inner and outer radius edges with
   small degradation to the optical quality factor (Q). Radiative coupling
   between degenerate modes of adjacent radial spatial order leads to
   imaginary frequency (Q) splitting and a scatterer avoiding high-Q
   ``wiggler{''} supermode field. We experimentally measure Qs up to 258
   000 in devices fabricated in a silicon device layer on buried oxide
   undercladding and up to 139 000 in devices fully suspended in air using
   an undercut step. Wiggler supermodes are true modes of the microphotonic
   system that offer additional degrees of freedom in electrical, thermal,
   and mechanical design. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) waves have been shown to significantly
   affect the near-field photophysical phenomenon. In particular, strong
   Coulombic interactions can enhance nearby non-linear optics and energy
   transfer process, while SPP waves also affect other photophysical
   processes like quenching observed in fluorescent and excitonic systems.
   Here, using different plasmonic substrates, we show the effect of
   plasmon-enhancement on quenching, phonon-assisted non-radiative decay,
   weak Purcell effect or electromagnetic field enhancement, and energy
   transfer rates of upconverting doped-lanthanide nanoparticles. While the
   resonant plasmons enhance the local electromagnetic field and the rate
   of energy transfer leading to enhanced upconversion photoluminescence of
   infrared radiation to visible light, it can also increase the quenching
   and non-radiative decay rates of photoexcited electron-hole pairs
   leading to losses and lower efficiency. These results can guide the
   design of optimized substrate geometry for using surface plasmons to
   modulate the photophysics in other applications too. (C) 2014 Optical

Abstract = {{Aging in super glassy polymers such as poly(trimethylsilylpropyne)
   (PTMSP), poly(4-methyl-2-pentyne) (PMP), and polymers with intrinsic
   microporosity (PIM-1) reduces gas permeabilities and limits their
   application as gas-separation membranes. While super glassy polymers are
   initially very porous, and ultra-permeable, they quickly pack into a
   denser phase becoming less porous and permeable. This age-old problem
   has been solved by adding an ultraporous additive that maintains the low
   density, porous, initial stage of super glassy polymers through
   absorbing a portion of the polymer chains within its pores thereby
   holding the chains in their open position. This result is the first time
   that aging in super glassy polymers is inhibited whilst maintaining
   enhanced CO2 permeability for one year and improving CO2/N-2
   selectivity. This approach could allow super glassy polymers to be
   revisited for commercial application in gas separations.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Polymer dispersed liquid crystals are a useful model system for studying
   the relationship between surface topology and defect structures. They
   are comprised of a polymer matrix with suspended spherical nematic drops
   and are topologically constrained to host defects of an elementary
   hedgehog charge per droplet, such as bulk or surface point defects or
   closed disclination loops. We control the genus of the closed surfaces
   confining such micrometer-sized nematic drops with tangential boundary
   conditions for molecular alignment imposed by the polymer matrix,
   allowing us to avoid defects or, on the contrary, to generate them in a
   controlled way. We show, both experimentally and through numerical
   modeling, that topological constraints in nematic microdrops can be
   satisfied by hosting topologically stable half-integer bulk defect lines
   anchored to opposite sides of handlebody surfaces. This enriches the
   interplay of topologies of closed surfaces and fields with nonpolar
   symmetry, yielding new unexpected configurations that cannot be realized
   in vector fields, having potential implications for topologically
   similar defects in cosmology and other fields.}},

Abstract = {{To first order the ground magnetic signature of the equatorial
   electrojet (EEJ) reflects the height integral of J = sigma E, where
   sigma is a conductivity and E represents some combination of the global
   dynamo-generated electric field and the electric field due to local
   winds. Day-to-day variations in the conductivity are strongly controlled
   by the solar flux, while E depends on solar and lunar tides, planetary
   waves, and the disturbance dynamo. In this study we demonstrate how
   complexity is introduced into the EEJ due to the interaction between
   lunar tide variability in the equatorial electric field and solar-driven
   variability in the E region conductivity. Toward this end, we analyze
   magnetometer data from the Huancayo observatory both in the time and
   frequency domain. We present results for the year 1990, and we show that
   86\% of the variance in the EEJ is due to the lunar-solar interaction.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{We use both lyotropic liquid crystals composed of prolate micelles and
   thermotropic liquid crystals made of rod-like molecules to uniformly
   disperse and unidirectionally align relatively large gold nanorods and
   other complex-shaped nanoparticles at high concentrations. We show that
   some of these ensuing self-assembled orientationally ordered soft matter
   systems exhibit polarization-dependent plasmonic properties with
   strongly pronounced molar extinction exceeding that previously achieved
   in self-assembled composites. The long-range unidirectional alignment of
   gold nanorods is mediated mainly by anisotropic surface anchoring
   interactions at the surfaces of gold nanoparticles.
   Polarization-sensitive absorption, scattering, and extinction are used
   to characterize orientations of nanorods and other nanoparticles. The
   experimentally measured unique optical properties of these composites,
   which stem from the collective plasmonic effect of the gold nanorods
   with long-range order in a liquid crystal matrix, are reproduced in
   computer simulations. A simple phenomenological model based on
   anisotropic surface interaction explains the alignment of gold nanorods
   dispersed in liquid crystals and the physical underpinnings behind our
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{The UV inactivation kinetics of bacteriophages MS2, PhiX174, T1 and PRD1
   and the potential of bacterial UV repair mechanisms to reactivate these
   bacteriophages is described here. The selected bacteriophages represent
   a range of genome size, single and double stranded genomes, circular and
   linear organization and RNA and DNA. Bacteriophages were exposed to UV
   irradiation from two different collimated beam UV irradiation sources
   (medium-pressure (MP) mercury lamps and low-pressure (LP) mercury lamps)
   and assayed during which host-phage cultures were exposed to
   photoreactivating light for 6 h, then incubated overnight at 37 C in the
   dark. Dark controls following UV exposure were performed in parallel. UV
   inactivation kinetics (using dark controls) showed that circular ssDNA
   phage (PhiX174) was the most sensitive and linear ssRNA phage (MS2) was
   the more resistant phage. No photoreactivation was observed for MS2 (RNA
   phage) and the highest photoreactivation was observed for PRD1. In the
   case of PRD1, the dose required for 4-log reduction (dark control) was
   around 35 mJ/cm(2), with a similar dose observed for both UV sources (MP
   and LP). When the photoreactivation step was added, the dose required
   for 4-log reduction using LP lamps was 103 mj/cm(2) and for MP lamps was
   60 mJ/cm(2). Genome organization differences between bacteriophages play
   an important role in resistance to UV inactivation and potential
   photoreactivation mediated by bacterial host mechanisms. The use of
   photoreactivation during the assay of PRD1 creates a more conservative
   surrogate for potential use in UV challenge testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The microstructure of neat conjugated polymers is crucial in determining
   the ultimate morphology and photovoltaic performance of
   polymer/fullerene blends, yet until recently, little work has focused on
   controlling the former. Here, we demonstrate that both the long-range
   order along the (100)-direction and the lamellar crystal thickness along
   the (001)-direction in neat poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and
   poly{[}(3,3-didecyl{[}2,2:5,2-terthiophene]-5,5-diyl)] (PTTT-10) thin
   films can be manipulated by varying crystallization temperature. Changes
   in crystalline domain size impact the yield and dynamics of
   photogenerated charge carriers. Time-resolved microwave conductivity
   measurements show that neat polymer films composed of larger crystalline
   domains have longer photoconductance lifetimes and charge carrier yield
   decreases with increasing crystallite size for P3HT. Our results suggest
   that the classical polymer science description of temperature-dependent
   crystallization of polymers from solution can be used to understand
   thin-film formation in neat conjugated polymers, and hence, should be
   considered when discussing the structural evolution of organic bulk
   heterojunctions. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part

Abstract = {{Electric-powered transportation requires an efficient, low-cost, and
   safe energy storage system with high energy density and power
   capability. Despite its high specific capacity, the current commercially
   available cathode material for today's state-of-art Li-ion batteries,
   lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxide Li{[}Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3]O-2 (NMC),
   suffers from poor cycle life for high temperature operation and marginal
   rate capability resulting from irreversible degradation of the cathode
   material upon cycling. Using an atomicscale surface engineering, the
   performance of Li{[}Ni1/3Mn1/3Co1/3]O-2 in terms of rate capability and
   high temperature cycle-life is significantly improved. The Al2O3 coating
   deposited by atomic layer deposition (ALD) dramatically reduces the
   degradation in cell conductivity and reaction kinetics. This durable
   ultrathin Al2O3-ALD coating layer also improves stability for the NMC at
   an elevated temperature (55 C). The experimental results suggest that a
   highly durable and safe cathode material enabled by atomic-scale surface
   modification could meet the demanding performance and safety
   requirements of nextgeneration electric vehicles. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{We investigate the dynamics of spatially discordant alternans (SDA)
   driven by an instability of intracellular calcium cycling using both
   amplitude equations {[}P. S. Skardal, A. Karma, and J. G. Restrepo,
   Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 108103 (2012)] and ionic model simulations. We
   focus on the common case where the bidirectional coupling of
   intracellular calcium concentration and membrane voltage dynamics
   produces calcium and voltage alternans that are temporally in phase. We
   find that, close to the alternans bifurcation, SDA is manifested as a
   smooth wavy modulation of the amplitudes of both repolarization and
   calcium transient (CaT) alternans, similarly to the well- studied case
   of voltage-driven alternans. In contrast, further away from the
   bifurcation, the amplitude of CaT alternans jumps discontinuously at the
   nodes separating out-of-phase regions, while the amplitude of
   repolarization alternans remains smooth. We identify universal dynamical
   features of SDA pattern formation and evolution in the presence of those
   jumps. We show that node motion of discontinuous SDA patterns is
   strongly hysteretic even in homogeneous tissue due to the novel
   phenomenon of ``unidirectional pinning{''}: node movement can only be
   induced towards, but not away from, the pacing site in response to a
   change of pacing rate or physiological parameter. In addition, we show
   that the wavelength of discontinuous SDA patterns scales linearly with
   the conduction velocity restitution length scale, in contrast to the
   wavelength of smooth patterns that scales sublinearly with this length
   scale. Those results are also shown to be robust against cell-to-cell
   fluctuations due to the property that unidirectional node motion
   collapses multiple jumps accumulating in nodal regions into a single
   jump. Amplitude equation predictions are in good overall agreement with
   ionic model simulations. Finally, we briefly discuss physiological
   implications of our findings. In particular, we suggest that due to the
   tendency of conduction blocks to form near nodes, the presence of
   unidirectional pinning makes calcium-driven alternans potentially more
   arrhythmogenic than voltage-driven alternans.}},

Abstract = {{A correlation dimension analysis of people's visual experiential streams
   captured by a smartphone shows that visual experience is two-scaled with
   a smaller dimension at shorter length scales than at longer length
   scales. The bend between the two scales is a phase transition point
   where the lower scale primarily captures relationships within the same
   context and the higher dimensional scale captures relationships between
   different contexts. The dimensionality estimates are confirmed using
   Takens' delay embedding procedure on the image stream, while the
   randomly permuted stream is shown to be space-filling thereby
   establishing that the two-scaled structure is a consequence of the
   dynamics. We note that the structure of visual experience closely
   resembles the structure of another domain of experience: natural
   language discourse. The emergence of an identical structure across
   different domains of human experience suggests that the two-scaled
   geometry reflects a general organizational principle.}},

Abstract = {{The normalized microwave reflection index (NMRI) is a measure of
   multipath scattering calculated daily from continuously operating GPS
   sites. GPS satellites transmit L-band microwave signals, and thus NMRI
   is sensitive to the amount of water in vegetation, not plant greenness
   or dry biomass. The sensing footprint is approximately 1000m(2),
   although reflections from a distance of hundreds of metres are important
   at some sites. NMRI exhibits clear seasonal variations that are linked
   to the changes in vegetation water content that accompany plant growth
   and senescence. In this paper, NMRI and the normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) are compared for the period 2008-2012. NMRI data
   are derived from 184 GPS sites in the western USA. NDVI data are from
   the 250m, 16-day pixel containing each GPS station. Amplitude of the
   annual growth cycle and correlation between NMRI and NDVI are estimated,
   with and without lags. Phenology metrics are calculated from both
   indices (i.e. the start of the growing season, timing of peak growth,
   and season length). NMRI and NDVI are correlated at most sites, but the
   degree of correlation varies regionally. Correlation is lowest in
   California and coastal regions (R=0.25), where NDVI increases earlier in
   the spring than NMRI. It is highest for mountain and prairie sites
   (R=0.66 and 0.73, respectively). Allowing for a lag between NMRI and
   NDVI greatly increases the correlation. The lag that yields the greatest
   correlation is nearly 30 days for the California sites (R=0.71 with
   lag), but only 10 days for mountain and prairie sites (R=0.78 and 0.85
   with lag). There are clear differences in phenology metrics extracted
   from NMRI and NDVI that are consistent with the correlation-lag
   analysis. Using NMRI, there is a later start to the season, later peak
   day of the year, and shorter season length. The greatest differences are
   in California where NDVI start of the season is nearly 60 days earlier
   than that calculated from NMRI. These data suggest that green-up
   precedes increases in vegetation water content, with the duration of
   offset varying regionally. This study is the first to compare
   GPS-derived microwave reflectance data with NDVI at multiple sites, and
   highlights both opportunities and limitations offered by NMRI data.}},

Abstract = {{Cell cultures are indispensable to develop and study efficacy of
   therapeutic agents, prior to their use in animal models. We have the

   limitation as well as provides an opportunity to evaluate critical
   mechanisms of toxicity of potential poisonous inhaled chemicals. We
   describe enhanced loss of membrane integrity, caspase release and death

Abstract = {{Measurements of vegetation state are required both for modeling and
   satellite validation. Reflected GPS signals recorded by the Plate
   Boundary Observatory network provide a source of new information about
   vegetation state in the western United States and Alaska. The GPS ground
   stations were installed between 2005 and 2008 to measure plate boundary
   deformation. They operate continuously and transmit their data to a
   public facility at least once per day. However, they also act as
   bi-static radars by recording the interference between a direct GPS
   signal (transmitted at 1.5 GHz) and a reflected GPS signal. The
   frequency of this interference pattern primarily depends on the vertical
   distance between the antenna and the ground reflector. As an L-band
   sensor, the amplitude of the interference pattern depends on vegetation
   water content. A daily vegetation metric that depends on reflection
   amplitudes, Normalized Microwave Reflection Index (NMRI), is defined. A
   method for removing outliers caused by snow and rain is described. The
   footprint of NMRI depends on the antenna height and local terrain. The
   minimum footprint is. A database of more than 300 station NMRI time
   series has been compiled; these data span the period from 2007 to 2012.
   Comparisons between NMRI and in situ sampling of vegetation state are
   the subject of a companion paper.}},

Abstract = {{The Normalized Microwave Reflection Index (NMRI) measures the intensity
   of GPS reflections, which is affected by vegetation within similar to
   100 mof GPS antennas. In a companion paper, the theoretical basis for
   NMRI and how it is derived from data archived at geodetic GPS
   installations are described. NMRI is calculated by normalizing the
   standard GPS metric MP(1)rms on a site-by-site basis to minimize terrain
   effects. Here, we validate NMRI as a metric for estimating vegetation
   water content (VWC) and evaluate the normalization procedure. In situ
   measurements of plant height, biomass, and VWC were taken on a biweekly
   basis during 2012 at four grassland sites in Montana. These measurements
   were compared to time series of MP(1)rms, NMRI, and Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from each site. At each site, a
   significant linear relationship exists between MP(1)rms and VWC.
   However, this relationship is not consistent across sites. Once
   normalized, a linear relationship exists between NMRI and VWC (r(2) =
   0.71) that is consistent across the four sites. This suggests that VWC
   could be predicted from NMRI at sites without in situ observations, as
   long as vegetation and climate are similar. There is no clear
   relationship between NMRI and either vegetation height or biomass. The
   importance of normalization is shown using data from eight additional
   sites. After normalization, a strong positive correlation is apparent
   between NMRI and NDVI across all grassland GPS sites in Montana.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines air-to-air injection heat pumps (HPs) and proposes a
   method to determine both heating capacity and coefficient of performance
   (COP) in situ, allowing analyses of already-installed setups and
   long-term observation. Due to the uncertain nature of air enthalpy
   measurements, this method instead uses refrigerant enthalpies calculated
   from pipe contact temperatures and steady-state energy balances to
   determine the COP. However, these energy balances are highly dependent
   on the hypothesis that the working fluid remains strictly monophasic in
   certain locations, which is not always true in practice. A parametric
   variable analysis is conducted on the refrigerant vapor quality to
   calculate the deviation in the COP due to diphasic conditions at the
   compressor inlet, injection port, and condenser and flash tank outlets.
   A final in situ COP uncertainty is presented, due to both the
   measurement and vapor quality uncertainties. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd and

Abstract = {{A common goal across different fields (e.g. separations, biosensors,
   biomaterials, pharmaceuticals) is to understand how protein behavior at
   solid-liquid interfaces is affected by environmental conditions.
   Temperature, pH, ionic strength, and the chemical and physical
   properties of the solid surface, among many factors, can control
   microscopic protein dynamics (e.g. adsorption, desorption, diffusion,
   aggregation) that contribute to macroscopic properties like
   time-dependent total protein surface coverage and protein structure.
   These relationships are typically studied through a top-down approach in
   which macroscopic observations are explained using analytical models
   that are based upon reasonable, but not universally true, simplifying
   assumptions about microscopic protein dynamics. Conclusions connecting
   microscopic dynamics to environmental factors can be heavily biased by
   potentially incorrect assumptions. In contrast, more complicated models
   avoid several of the common assumptions but require many parameters that
   have overlapping effects on predictions of macroscopic, average protein
   properties. Consequently, these models are poorly suited for the
   top-down approach. Because the sophistication incorporated into these
   models may ultimately prove essential to understanding interfacial
   protein behavior, this article proposes a bottom-up approach in which
   direct observations of microscopic protein dynamics specify parameters
   in complicated models, which then generate macroscopic predictions to
   compare with experiment. In this framework, single-molecule tracking has
   proven capable of making direct measurements of microscopic protein
   dynamics, but must be complemented by modeling to combine and
   extrapolate many independent microscopic observations to the
   macro-scale. The bottom-up approach is expected to better connect
   environmental factors to macroscopic protein behavior, thereby guiding
   rational choices that promote desirable protein behaviors. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We use a forward modeling program to derive one-dimensional isotropic
   plasma characteristics in Saturn's inner, equatorial magnetosphere using
   a novel correction for the spacecraft potential and penetrating

   simultaneous modeling of plasma data and systematic errors when
   operating on large data sets, which greatly reduces the computation time
   and accurately quantifies instrument noise. The data set consists of
   particle measurements from the electron spectrometer (ELS) and the ion
   mass spectrometer (IMS), which are part of the Cassini Plasma
   Spectrometer (CAPS) instrument suite on board the data are limited to
   peak ion flux measurements within +/- 10 degrees magnetic latitude and
   3-15 geocentric equatorial radial distance (RS). Systematic errors such
   as spacecraft charging and penetrating background radiation are
   parameterized individually in the modeling and are automatically
   addressed during the fitting procedure. The resulting values are in turn
   used as cross calibration between IMS and ELS, where we show a
   significant improvement in magnetospheric electron densities and minor
   changes in the ion characteristics due to the error adjustments.

   close agreement, consistent with charge neutrality throughout Saturn's
   inner magnetosphere and confirming the spacecraft potential to be a

Title = {{Ionosphere variability during the 2009 SSW: Influence of the lunar

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{To investigate ionosphere variability during the 2009 sudden
   stratosphere warming (SSW), we present simulation results that combine
   the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model Extended version and the
   thermosphere-ionosphere-mesosphere electrodynamics general circulation
   model (TIME-GCM). The simulations reveal notable enhancements in both
   the migrating semidiurnal solar (SW2) and lunar (M2) tides during the
   SSW. The SW2 and M2 amplitudes reach approximate to 50ms-1 and
   approximate to 40ms-1, respectively, in zonal wind at E region
   altitudes. The dramatic increase in the M2 at these altitudes influences
   the dynamo generation of electric fields, and the importance of the M2
   on the ionosphere variability during the 2009 SSW is demonstrated by
   comparing simulations with and without the M2. TIME-GCM simulations that
   incorporate the M2 are found to be in good agreement with Jicamarca
   Incoherent Scatter Radar vertical plasma drifts and Constellation
   Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere, and Climate (COSMIC)
   observations of the maximum F region electron density. The agreement
   with observations is worse if the M2 is not included in the simulation,
   demonstrating that the lunar tide is an important contributor to the
   ionosphere variability during the 2009 SSW. We additionally investigate
   sources of the F region electron density variability during the SSW. The
   primary driver of the electron density variability is changes in
   electric fields. Changes in meridional neutral winds and thermosphere
   composition are found to also contribute to the electron density
   variability during the 2009 SSW. The electron density variability for
   the 2009 SSW is therefore not solely due to variability in electric
   fields as previously thought.}},

Abstract = {{Time-accurate dynamic simulation of objects and spacecraft in rarefied
   and continuum-rarefied transition flows during atmospheric entry is
   computationally challenging. The traditional ballistic approach based on
   averaged empirical coefficients cannot account for nonlinear effects
   from high-frequency attitude variation. The direct simulation Monte
   Carlo method is shown to provide the capability to model these unsteady
   effects. Time-accurate simulations of two distinct geometries in low
   thermospheric orbits and atmospheric entry are performed. Characteristic
   qualities of motion, such as stability, equilibria, and other limiting
   behavior, are identified. This approach illustrates the potential for
   accurate prediction of the unsteady orbital and entry dynamics for
   improved spacecraft design, atmospheric science, and orbital decay
   prediction as well as a number of new challenges for future work to
   stimulate the development of a new subfield of spacecraft dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an evaluation of the effective stress concept in
   unsaturated, compacted silt at low degrees of saturation. A set of
   isothermal, consolidated-drained triaxial tests was performed on silt
   specimens under different combinations of total suction and net normal
   stress. The total suction was controlled using an automated humidity
   system, and variables monitored during equilibration and shearing
   include anisotropic volume change, axial displacement, temperature,
   relative humidity at the top and bottom of the specimen, and the gas
   pressure difference across the specimen. The results from the triaxial
   tests were analyzed to examine the applicability of predicting the
   suction stress characteristic curve (SSCC) using parameters from soil
   water retention curve (SWRC) models fitted to experimental data obtained
   at low suction magnitudes. The SSCC predicted from the SWRC at low
   suctions was found to overpredict the suction stress values at high
   suctions obtained from back-extrapolation of the failure envelope to
   define the tensile strength. However, small adjustments in the fitting
   of the SWRC were found to provide a better fit between the SSCC and
   experimental suction stress data. The suction stress defined using the
   adjusted SWRC was found to provide a good interpretation of the critical

Abstract = {{Risk factors for fibrocalcific aortic valve disease (FCAVD) are
   associated with systemic decreases in bioavailability of
   endothelium-derived nitric oxide (EDNO). In patients with bicuspid
   aortic valve (BAV), vascular expression of endothelial nitric oxide
   synthase (eNOS) is decreased, and eNOS(-/-) mice have increased
   prevalence of BAV. The goal of this study was to test the hypotheses
   that EDNO attenuates profibrotic actions of valve interstitial cells
   (VICs) in vitro and that EDNO deficiency accelerates development of
   FCAVD in vivo. As a result of the study, coculture of VICs with aortic
   valve endothelial cells (vlvECs) significantly decreased VIC activation,
   a critical early phase of FCAVD. Inhibition of VIC activation by vlvECs
   was attenuated by N-G-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester or indomethacin.
   Coculture with vlvECs attenuated VIC expression of matrix
   metalloproteinase-9, which depended on stiffness of the culture matrix.
   Coculture with vlvECs preferentially inhibited collagen-3, compared with
   collagen-1, gene expression. BAV occurred in 30\% of eNOS(-/-) mice. At
   age 6 mo, collagen was increased in both bicuspid and trileaflet
   eNOS(-/-) aortic valves, compared with wild-type valves. At 18 mo, total
   collagen was similar in eNOS(-/-) and wild-type mice, but collagen-3 was
   preferentially increased in eNOS(-/-) mice. Calcification and apoptosis
   were significantly increased in BAV of eNOS(-/-) mice at ages 6 and 18
   mo. Remarkably, these histological changes were not accompanied by
   physiologically significant valve stenosis or regurgitation. In
   conclusion, coculture with vlvECs inhibits specific profibrotic VIC
   processes. In vivo, eNOS deficiency produces fibrosis in both trileaflet
   and BAVs but produces calcification only in BAVs.}},

Abstract = {{Single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy was
   employed in conjunction with resonance energy transfer (RET) to observe
   the dynamic behavior of donor-labeled ssDNA at the interface between
   aqueous solution and a solid surface decorated with complementary

   determined for both complementary strands and negative control ssDNA.
   RET was used to identify trajectory segments corresponding to the
   hybridized state. The vast majority of molecules from solution adsorbed
   nonspecifically to the surface, where a brief two-dimensional search was
   performed with a 7\% chance of hybridization. Successful hybridization
   events occurred with a characteristic search time of similar to 0.1 s,
   and unsuccessful searches resulted in desorption from the surface,
   ultimately repeating the adsorption and search process. Hybridization

   15 s) and short-lived (similar to 1.4 s) hybridized time intervals. A
   strand that melted back onto the surface could rehybridize after a brief

Abstract = {{Nitrogen (N) use in intensive agriculture can degrade groundwater
   resources. However, considerable time lags between groundwater recharge
   and extraction complicate source attribution and remedial responses. We
   construct a historic N mass balance of two agricultural regions of
   California to understand trends and drivers of past and present N
   loading to groundwater (1945-2005). Changes in groundwater N loading
   result from historic changes in three factors: the extent of agriculture
   (cropland area and livestock herd increased 120 and 800\%,
   respectively), the intensity of agriculture (synthetic and manure waste
   effluent N input rates increased by 525 and 1500\%, respectively), and
   the efficiency of agriculture (crop and milk production per unit of N
   input increased by 25 and 19\%, respectively). The net consequence has
   been a greater-than-order-of-magnitude increase in nitrate (NO3-)
   loading over the time period, with 163 Gg N yr(-1) now being leached to
   groundwater from approximately 1.3 million ha of farmland (not including
   alfalfa {[} Medicago sativa L.]). Meeting safe drinking water standards
   would require NO 3 leaching reductions of over 70\% from current levels
   through reductions in excess manure applications, which accounts for
   nearly half of all groundwater N loading, and through synthetic N
   management improvements. This represents a broad challenge given current
   economic and technical conditions of California farming if farm
   productivity is to be maintained. The findings illustrate the growing
   tension-characteristic of agricultural regions globally-between
   intensifying food, feed, fiber, and biofuel production and preserving
   clean water.}},

Title = {{Clickable, Photodegradable Hydrogels to Dynamically Modulate Valvular
   Interstitial Cell Phenotype}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{Biophysical cues are widely recognized to influence cell phenotype.
   While this evidence was established using static substrates, there is
   growing interest in creating stimulus-responsive biomaterials that
   better recapitulate the dynamic extracellular matrix. Here, a clickable,
   photodegradable hydrogel substrate that allows the user to precisely
   control substrate elasticity and topography in situ is presented. The
   hydrogels are synthesized by reacting an 8-arm poly(ethylene glycol)
   alkyne with an azide-functionalized photodegradable crosslinker. The
   utility of this platform by exploiting its photoresponsive properties to
   modulate the phenotype of porcine aortic valvular interstitial cells
   (VICs) is demonstrated. First, VIC phenotype is monitored, in response
   to initial substratum modulus and static topographic cues. Higher
   modulus (E approximate to 15 kPa) substrates induce higher levels of
   activation (approximate to 70\% myofibroblasts) versus soft (E
   approximate to 3 kPa) substrates (approximate to 20\% myofibroblasts).
   Microtopographies that induce VIC alignment and elongation on low
   modulus substrates also stimulate activation. Finally, VIC phenotype is
   monitored in response to sequential in situ manipulations. The results
   illustrate that VIC activation on stiff surfaces (approximate to 70\%
   myofibroblasts) can be partially reversed by reducing surface modulus
   (approximate to 30\% myofibroblats) and subsequently re-activated by
   anisotropic topographies (approximate to 60\% myofibroblasts). Such
   dynamic substrates afford unique opportunities to decipher the complex
   role of matrix cues on the plasticity of VIC activation.}},

Abstract = {{There has been consistent interest among speech signal processing
   researchers in the accurate estimation of the fundamental frequency
   (F-0) of speech signals. This study examines ten F-0 estimation
   algorithms (some well-established and some proposed more recently) to
   determine which of these algorithms is, on average, better able to
   estimate F-0 in the sustained vowel /a/. Moreover, a robust method for
   adaptively weighting the estimates of individual F-0 estimation
   algorithms based on quality and performance measures is proposed, using
   an adaptive Kalman filter (KF) framework. The accuracy of the algorithms
   is validated using (a) a database of 117 synthetic realistic phonations
   obtained using a sophisticated physiological model of speech production
   and (b) a database of 65 recordings of human phonations where the
   glottal cycles are calculated from electroglottograph signals. On
   average, the sawtooth waveform inspired pitch estimator and the nearly
   defect-free algorithms provided the best individual F-0 estimates, and
   the proposed KF approach resulted in a similar to 16\% improvement in
   accuracy over the best single F-0 estimation algorithm. These findings
   may be useful in speech signal processing applications where sustained
   vowels are used to assess vocal quality, when very accurate F-0
   estimation is required. (C) 2014 Acoustical Society of America.}},

Pages = {{788-811}},

Abstract = {{We explore the hypothesis that, due to small van der Waals forces
   between constituent grains, small rubble pile asteroids have a small but
   nonzero cohesive strength. The nature of this model predicts that the
   cohesive strength should be constant independent of asteroid size, which
   creates a scale dependence with relative strength increasing as size
   decreases. This model counters classical theory that rubble pile
   asteroids should behave as scale-independent cohesionless collections of
   rocks. We explore a simple model for asteroid strength that is based on
   these weak forces, validate it through granular mechanics simulations
   and comparisons with properties of lunar regolith, and then explore its
   implications and ability to explain and predict observed properties of
   small asteroids in the NEA and Main Belt populations, and in particular
   of asteroid 2008 TC3. One conclusion is that the population of rapidly
   rotating asteroids could consist of both distributions of smaller grains

Abstract = {{At the present study, application of endurance time analysis (ETA)
   method in seismic evaluation of arch dams is investigated. ETA is a
   time-history based dynamic pushover procedure, which utilizes a set of
   predesigned intensifying acceleration functions to estimate the
   responses of the structural systems in various seismic excitation
   levels. Dez dam was chosen as the case study and all contraction and
   peripheral joints were modeled based on as-built drawings. The reservoir
   was modeled as a compressible medium and the foundation was assumed to
   be massless. Results show that ETA method is able to estimate dynamic
   responses of the dam with acceptable accuracy in comparison with time
   history analysis (THA). The great advantage of ETA method lies on the
   noticeable reduction of the computational demand in comparison with THA
   for considering seismic behaviors of the infrastructures.}},

Title = {{LAPLACE PLANE MODIFICATIONS ARISING FROM SOLAR RADIATION PRESSURE}},

Abstract = {{The dynamical effects of solar radiation pressure (SRP) in the solar
   system have been rigorously studied since the early 1900s. This
   non-gravitational perturbation plays a significant role in the evolution
   of dust particles in circumplanetary orbits, as well as in the orbital
   motion about asteroids and comets. For gravitationally dominated orbits,
   SRP is negligible and the resulting motion is largely governed by the
   oblateness of the primary and the attraction of the Sun. The interplay
   between these gravitational perturbations gives rise to three mutually
   perpendicular planes of equilibrium for circular satellite orbits. The
   classical Laplace plane lies between the equatorial and orbital planes
   of the primary, and is the mean reference plane about whose axis the
   pole of a satellite's orbit precesses. From a previously derived
   solution for the secular motion of an orbiter about a small body in a
   SRP dominated environment, we find that SRP acting alone will cause an
   initially circular orbit to precess around the pole of the primary's
   heliocentric orbital plane. When the gravitational and non-gravitational
   perturbations act in concert, the resulting equilibrium planes turn out
   to be qualitatively different, in some cases, from those obtained
   without considering the radiation pressure. The warping of the surfaces
   swept out by the modified equilibria as the semi-major axis varies
   depends critically on the cross-sectional area of the body exposed.
   These results, together with an adiabatic invariance argument on
   Poynting-Robertson drag, provide a natural qualitative explanation for
   the initial albedo dichotomy of Saturn's moon, Iapetus.}},

Abstract = {{A new, general approach to constitutive modeling for non-Newtonian
   liquids (i.e., formulating an equation for the stress tensor in flows
   with arbitrary kinematics) is proposed and tested, with a particular
   application to a dilute emulsion of deformable drops. A generalized
   traceless Oldroyd model is used for the drop-phase contribution to the
   stress tensor, with five material parameters allowed to be functions of
   one instantaneous flow invariant. Two choices for this invariant are
   explored (i) the second invariant I-2 of the rate-of-strain tensor and
   (ii) the energy dissipation rate. In both versions, all five parameters
   are found from simultaneously fitting the Oldroyd model to viscometric
   and extensiometric functions for steady shear and planar extension (PE),
   respectively, at arbitrary flow intensities. The model predictions are
   compared to precise (but computationally intensive) results from
   boundary-integral simulations for several flows different from simple
   shear or PE. The energy dissipation rate is found to be generally a much
   better choice for the invariant than I-2, especially for comparable drop
   and continuous-phase viscosities, and it provides very good accuracy in
   a wide range of conditions (away from drop breakup). Test examples
   include mixed planar flow, uniaxial/biaxial extension, flow in a cavity
   with a moving wall, and flow past a macroscopic sphere. Unlike
   small-deformation theories, the present approach can be extended to
   large-strain flows of highly concentrated emulsions. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{Pt nanoparticles were grown on titanium oxide and tungsten oxide at 200
   degrees C by Pt atomic layer deposition (ALD) using platinum(II)
   hexafluoroacetylacetonate {[}Pt(hfac)(2)] and formalin as the reactants.
   The Pt ALD surface chemistry and Pt nanoparticles were examined using in
   situ Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) vibrational spectroscopy and ex
   situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The FTIR spectra identified
   the surface species after the Pt(hfac)(2) and formalin exposures on
   TiO2. An infrared feature at similar to 2100 cm(-1) in the FTIR spectrum
   after Pt(hfac)(2) and formalin exposures on TiO2 was consistent with CO
   on Pt, revealing that Pt(hfac)(2) and formalin exposures led to the
   formation of Pt nanoparticles. The FTIR spectrum of Pt(hfac)(2) on TiO2
   was very similar to the FTIR spectrum of hexafluoroacetylacetone (hfacH)
   on TiO2. The FTIR spectra also revealed that hfacH blocked the
   adsorption of Pt(hfac)(2) on TiO2. The coverage of the Pt nanoparticles
   could be reduced by preadsorbing hfacH on TiO2 prior to Pt(hfac)(2)
   adsorption. Time-dependent FTIR spectra showed that the coverage of
   hfacH and its adsorption products were reduced versus time following
   hfacH exposure. Pt ALD on WOx at 200 degrees C led to the growth of Pt
   nanoparticles that were fairly similar to the Pt nanoparticles from Pt
   ALD on TiO2. The TEM images revealed that the size of the Pt
   nanoparticles on WOx could be adjusted by varying the number of Pt ALD
   cycles. Because of site-blocking by the hfac ligands, the Pt(hfac)(2)
   and formalin reactants required many more ALD cycles for nucleation and
   growth compared with other Pt ALD surface chemistries.}},

Abstract = {{Recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) was lyophilized with various
   glass-forming stabilizers, employing cycles that incorporated various
   freezing and annealing procedures to manipulate glass formation
   kinetics, associated relaxation processes, and glass-specific surface
   areas (SSAs). The secondary structure in the cake was monitored by
   infrared and in reconstituted samples by circular dichroism. The rhGH
   concentrations on the surface of lyophilized powders were determined
   from electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis. Glass transition
   temperature (T-g), SSAs, and water contents were determined immediately
   after lyophilization. Lyophilized samples were incubated at 323 K for 16
   weeks, and the resulting extents of rhGH aggregation, oxidation, and
   deamidation were determined after rehydration. Water contents and T-g
   were independent of lyophilization process parameters. Compared with
   samples lyophilized after rapid freezing, rhGH in samples that had been
   annealed in frozen solids prior to drying, or annealed in glassy solids
   after secondary drying retained more native-like protein secondary
   structure, had a smaller fraction of the protein on the surface of the
   cake, and exhibited lower levels of degradation during incubation. A
   simple kinetic model suggested that the differences in the extent of
   rhGH degradation during storage in the dried state between different
   formulations and processing methods could largely be ascribed to the
   associated levels of rhGH at the solid-air interface after
   lyophilization. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Abstract = {{Objectives. To examine effects of shrinkage and modulus on the dynamic
   development of shrinkage stress as a function of methacrylate conversion
   and filler loading in a model photocurable dimethacrylate-based resin
   with a silanized barium glass filler.
   Methods. BisGMA/TEGDMA samples with filler loading levels of 0-70 wt\%
   were evaluated. Irradiation times and intensities were varied to achieve
   a wide range of conversion. Shrinkage stress measurements were
   accompanied with real-time conversion monitoring, while shrinkage and
   modulus measurements were made at different static conversion points.
   Results. Shrinkage increased nearly linearly with respect to conversion,
   while for a given value of conversion, it decreased proportionally with
   increasing filler content. Modulus advanced in an exponential fashion
   with conversion and also increased incrementally with filler content;
   however, modulus values rose disproportionately rapidly for the highest
   filler loading. At either high or low filler loading levels, stress at
   limiting conversion, which was inversely proportional to the filler
   load, was high while at an intermediate filler content, a minimum in
   stress was observed due to the combined effects of filler based
   shrinkage reduction, restricted limiting conversion and only moderately
   enhanced modulus. The level of polymerization stress predicted from the
   conversion-indexed shrinkage and modulus measurements over-estimated the
   experimental stress states as modulus evolved due to system compliance
   that to some degree mimics the clinical situation presented by
   photocuring bonded composite restorations.
   Significance Measurement of monomer conversion provides a common basis
   by which different material properties can be rationally compared. (C)

   effective communication of the project's design to the end construction
   worker. Spatial design is frequently represented in two-dimensional (2D)
   drawings of various views. These views must be combined and decoded by
   the end user to effectively understand all orientations of a building
   element and can lead to errors. Advances in three-dimensional
   computer-aided design (3D CAD) and 3D printing have provided promising
   advancements in the presentation of spatial engineering information.
   This research investigates cognitive-workload demands of each
   information format. Cognitive workload is the amount of mental resources
   required to complete a task from the total available mental resources.
   Asking subjects to complete a reconstructing task of a simple structure
   using 2D drawings, a 3D CAD interface, and a 3D printed model introduces
   the individuals to alternative forms of information presentation. After
   completing the task, the subjects were surveyed on their perceptions of
   mental workload in six main factors using the NASA Task Load Index
   (TLX). Through a statistical analysis, there was no difference in mental
   workload between the three types of information presentation, indicating
   that the cognitive demands of the mediums are similar. However, there
   were statistically significant differences in workload factors due to
   demographic influences, such as occupation and CAD experience levels. In
   addition, mental workload affected the subject's productivity in task
   completion. The primary contribution to the overall body of knowledge is
   the investigation of mental workload as a factor in spatial
   understanding, and more specifically, identifying cognitive demands of
   individuals when presented with spatial engineering information in
   various formats.}},

Abstract = {{The use of performance measures for evaluating projects or agencies as a
   whole is not a new idea. Performance measures have been in use for many
   years in the private and public highway construction sectors for a
   variety of areas and tasks. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act
   of 2009 (ARRA) and federal transportation funding are now requiring
   state highway agencies to develop and document performance measures
   throughout their agency operations. However, few highway agencies use
   performance measures for cost estimating. This study synthesizes,
   categorizes, and validates existing performance measures for cost
   estimating of highway projects to assist with improving estimating
   accuracy. It provides a foundation for the development and use of new
   performance measures that agencies can share and use to improve
   estimating procedures. Performance measures for estimating were
   developed through an extensive literature review and content analysis to
   synthesize measures specifically for cost estimating in addition to
   categorizing the cost-estimating performance measures. These categories
   and performance measures were then validated with a questionnaire and
   interviews of selected state highway agency estimating experts. The main
   categories for these performance measures are bidding accuracy,
   estimating accuracy, competition effects, estimating processes, and
   contingency amounts. The results then provide a comprehensive list of
   valid performance measures for cost estimating in use today by highway
   agencies and a foundation for developing future measures.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{273}},
Pages = {{37-55}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a stabilized finite element formulation of the
   hydrodynamic Boltzmann transport equation (HBTE) to predict nearly
   incompressible fluid flow. The HBTE is discretized with Hermite
   polynomials in the velocity variable, and a streamline upwind
   Petrov-Galerkin formulation is used to discretize the spatial variable.
   A nonlinear stabilization scheme is presented, from which a simple
   linear stabilization scheme is constructed. In contrast to the
   Navier-Stokes (NS) equations, the HBTE is a first order equation and
   allows for conveniently enforcing Dirichlet conditions along immersed
   boundaries. A simple and efficient formulation for enforcing Dirichlet
   boundary conditions is presented and its accuracy is studied for
   immersed boundaries captured by the extended finite element method
   (XFEM). Numerical experiments indicate that both the linear and
   non-linear stabilization methods are sufficiently accurate and stable,
   but the linear formulation reduces the computational cost significantly.
   The accuracy of enforcing boundary conditions is satisfactory and shows
   second order convergence as the mesh is refined. Augmenting the boundary
   condition formulation with a penalty term increases the accuracy of
   enforcing the boundary condition constraints, but may degrade the
   accuracy of the global solution. Comparisons with results of a single
   relaxation time lattice Boltzmann method show that the proposed finite
   element method features greater robustness and lesser dependence of the
   computational costs on the level of mesh refinement. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Seismic ground motions induce torsional responses in buildings that can
   be difficult to predict. To compensate for this, most modern building
   codes require the consideration of accidental torsion when computing
   design earthquake forces. This study evaluates the influence of ASCE/SEI
   7 accidental torsion seismic design requirements on the performance of
   230 archetypical buildings that are designed with and without accidental
   torsion design provisions, taking building collapse capacity as the
   performance metric. The test case archetypes include a broad range of
   heights, gravity load levels, and plan configurations. Results show that
   the ASCE/SEI 7 accidental torsion provisions lead to significant changes
   in collapse capacity for buildings that are very torsionally flexible or
   asymmetric. However, only inconsequential changes in collapse capacity
   are observed in the buildings that are both torsionally stiff and
   regular in plan. Therefore, the study concludes that accidental torsion
   provisions are not necessary for seismic design of buildings without
   excessive torsional flexibility or asymmetry. Copyright (c) 2013 John

Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},

Volume = {{479}},
Pages = {{151-158}},

Abstract = {{The concentrations, size distributions, and mixing states of refractory
   black carbon (rBC) aerosols were measured with a ground-based Single
   Particle Soot Photometer (SP2), and aerosol absorption was measured with
   an Aethalometer at Qinghai Lake (QHL), a rural area in the Northeastern
   Tibetan Plateau of China in October 2011. The area was not pristine,
   with an average rBC mass concentration of 036 mu g STP-m(-3) during the
   two-week campaign period. The rBC concentration peaked at night and
   reached the minimal in the afternoon. This diurnal cycle of
   concentration is negatively correlated with the mixed layer depth and
   ventilation. When air masses from the west of QHL were sampled in late
   afternoon to early evening, the average rBC concentration of 021 mu g
   STP-m(-3) was observed, representing the rBC level in a larger Tibetan
   Plateau region because of the highest mixed layer depth. A log-normal
   primary mode with mass median diameter (MMD) of similar to 175 nm, and a
   small secondary lognormal mode with MMD of 470-500 nm of rBC were
   observed. Relative reduction in the secondary mode during a snow event
   supports recent work that suggested size dependent removal of rBC by
   precipitation. About 50\% of the observed rBC cores were identified as
   thickly coated by non-BC material. A comparison of the Aethalometer and
   SP2 measurements suggests that non-BC species significantly affect the
   Aethalometer measurements in this region. A scaling factor for the
   Aethalometer data at a wavelength of 880 nm is therefore calculated
   based on the measurements, which may be used to correct other
   Aethalometer datasets collected in this region for a more accurate
   estimate of the rBC loading. The results present here significantly
   improve our understanding of the characteristics of rBC aerosol in the
   less studied Tibetan Plateau region and further highlight the size
   dependent removal of BC via precipitation. (C) 2014 Elsevier BM. All

Abstract = {{Metastatic melanoma is highly resistant to drug treatment, and the
   underlying mechanisms of this resistance remain unclear. Increased
   tissue stiffness is correlated with tumor progression, but whether
   increased tissue stiffness contributes to treatment resistance in
   melanoma is not known. To investigate the effect of substrate stiffness
   on melanoma cell treatment responsiveness, PEG hydrogels were utilized
   as a cell culture system to precisely vary matrix elasticity and
   investigate melanoma cell responses to a commercially available
   pharmacological inhibitor (PLX4032). The tensile moduli were varied
   between 0.6 and 13.1 kPa (E) and the effects of PLX4032 on metabolic
   activity, apoptosis, and proliferation were evaluated on human cell
   lines derived from radial growth phase (WM35) and metastatic melanoma
   (A375). The A375 cells were found to be stiffness-independent; matrix
   elasticity did not alter cell morphology or apoptosis with PLX4032
   treatment. The WM35 cells, however, were more dependent on substrate
   modulus, displaying increased apoptosis and smaller focal adhesions on
   compliant substrates. Culturing melanoma cells on PEG hydrogels revealed
   stage-dependent responses to PLX4032 that would have otherwise been
   masked if cultured strictly on TCPS. These findings demonstrate the
   utility of PEG hydrogels as a versatile in vitro culture platform with
   which to investigate the molecular mechanisms of melanoma biology and
   treatment responsiveness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   dispersed throughout. While several studies have investigated the effect
   of reintroducing contact with ECM proteins on islet cell survival and
   function, the majority of these experiments only allow contact with the
   exterior cells. Thus, cell-culture platforms that enable the study of
   ECM-cell interactions throughout multi-cellular aggregates are of
   interest. Here, local presentation of ECM proteins was achieved using
   hydrogel microwell arrays to incorporate protein-laden microparticles
   during formation of MIN6 -cell aggregates. Varying the microparticle
   seeding density reproducibly controlled the number of microparticles
   incorporated within three-dimensional aggregates (i.e., total amount of
   protein). Further, a relatively uniform spatial distribution of laminin-
   and fibronectin-coated microparticles was achieved throughout the x-,
   y-, and z-directions. Multiple ECM proteins were presented to -cells in
   concert by incorporating two distinct populations of microparticles
   throughout the aggregates. Finally, scaling the microwell device
   dimensions allowed for the formation of two different sized
   cell-particle aggregates, approximate to 80 and 160 mu m in diameter.
   While the total number of microparticles incorporated per aggregate
   varied with size, the fraction of the aggregate occupied by
   microparticles was affected only by the microparticle seeding density,
   indicating that uniform local concentrations of proteins can be
   preserved while changing the overall aggregate dimensions. Biotechnol.

Abstract = {{The effects of the addition of small amounts of multifunctional monomers
   that contain functional groups capable of undergoing
   addition-fragmentation during radical polymerizations are investigated.
   Specifically, up to 6 wt \% of phenyl trithiocarbonate (TTC)-containing
   diacrylate was added to conventional thiol-multiacrylate
   photopolymerizations where its addition led to up to 60\% reduction in
   polymerization-induced shrinkage stress. The higher levels of TTC
   achieve the lowest stress though they also significantly depress the
   polymerization rate. Using up to 0.5 wt \% phenyl TTC successfully
   reduces the stress by nearly 20\%, demonstrating the effectiveness of
   the phenyl TTC, while minimizing the influence that the RAFT activity of
   the TTC unit has on the polymerization rate. When the polymerization
   rates of the TTC-containing resins are increased by changing the
   incident light intensity, complete acrylate conversion is achieved and
   the stress remains up to 40\% lower in the TTC-containing resins. (c)

Abstract = {{The concept of a critical permeation flux for the onset of particle
   deposition in crossflow microfiltration (CFMF) is well-established.
   However, the critical flux is known to be a function of process
   parameters such as the particle size, bulk concentration and crossflow
   velocity. In the present study, the critical modified Peclet number
   (Pe(crit)) is explored instead as a generalized criterion for the onset
   of particle deposition that incorporates the effects of these process
   parameters as well as the axial position along the membrane. A proper
   determination of Pe(crit) requires an accurate prediction of the
   concentration polarization boundary layer thickness delta(c) and
   shear-induced diffusion coefficient D-s. The classical Leveque model is
   adapted to allow for the effect of the permeation flux on the velocity
   profile. Moreover, the assumptions of a constant concentration at the
   membrane surface c(w), and constant D-s that have been made in prior
   studies are relaxed in an improved numerical solution to the convective
   diffusion equation that is used to predict delta(s) and D-s. The
   critical permeation flux is determined from particle deposition data
   taken for 6 and 10 mu m latex spheres via Direct Observation Through the
   Membrane (DOTM) characterization. A constant value of Pe(crit)=4.00 +/-
   0.08 is found to characterize the effects of particle diameter, bulk
   concentration and crossflow velocity as well as axial position on the
   onset of particle deposition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{253}},
Pages = {{239-250}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Design optimization for functionally graded battery electrodes is shown
   to improve the usable energy capacity of Li batteries predicted by
   computational simulations and numerically optimizing the electrode
   porosities and particle radii. A multi-scale battery model which
   accounts for nonlinear transient transport processes, electrochemical
   reactions, and mechanical deformations is used to predict the usable
   energy storage capacity of the battery over a range of discharge rates.
   A multi-objective formulation of the design problem is introduced to
   maximize the usable capacity over a range of discharge rates while
   limiting the mechanical stresses. The optimization problem is solved via
   a gradient based optimization. A LiMn2O4 cathode is simulated with a
   PEO-LiCF3SO3 electrolyte and both a Li Foil (half cell) and LiC6 anode.
   Studies were performed on both half and full cell configurations
   resulting in distinctly different optimal electrode designs. The
   numerical results show that the highest rate discharge drives the
   simulations and the optimal designs are dominated by Li+ transport
   rates. The results also suggest that spatially varying electrode
   porosities and active particle sizes provides an efficient approach to
   improve the power-to-energy density of Li+ batteries. For the half cell
   configuration, the optimal design improves the discharge capacity by
   29\% while for the full cell the discharge capacity was improved 61\%
   relative to an initial design with a uniform electrode structure. Most
   of the improvement in capacity was due to the spatially varying
   porosity, with up to 5\% of the gains attributed to the particle radii
   design variables. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{GaN high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs) are well suited for
   high-frequency operation due to their lower on resistance and device
   capacitance compared with traditional silicon devices. When grown on
   silicon carbide, GaN HEMTs can also achieve very high power density due
   to the enhanced power handling capabilities of the substrate. As a
   result, GaN-on-SiC HEMTs are increasingly popular in radio-frequency
   power amplifiers, and applications as switches in high-frequency power
   electronics are of high interest. This paper explores the use of
   GaN-on-SiC HEMTs in conventional pulse-width modulated switched-mode
   power converters targeting switching frequencies in the tens of
   megahertz range. Device sizing and efficiency limits of this technology
   are analyzed, and design principles and guidelines are given to exploit
   the capabilities of the devices. The results are presented for
   discrete-device and integrated implementations of a synchronous Buck
   converter, providing more than 10-W output power supplied from up to 40
   V with efficiencies greater than 95\% when operated at 10 MHz, and
   greater than 90\% at switching frequencies up to 40 MHz. As a practical
   application of this technology, the converter is used to accurately
   track a 3-MHz bandwidth communication envelope signal with 92\%
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{To investigate how surface oxygen participates in the reaction of
   important aromatic oxygenates, the surface chemistry of benzyl alcohol
   (PhCH2OH) and benzaldehyde (PhCHO) has been studied on oxygen-precovered
   Pd(111) (O/Pd(111)) using temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) and
   high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS). On both
   Pd(111) and O/Pd(111), TPD using isotopically labeled benzyl alcohol and
   low-temperature HREEL spectra show that the oxidation of benzyl alcohol
   proceeds through a benzyl alkoxide (PhCH2O-) intermediate to adsorbed
   benzaldehyde so that the sequence of bond scission is O-H followed by
   C-a-H. In the presence of surface O, some benzaldehyde desorbs from the
   surface below 300 K, consistent with the presence of a weakly adsorbed
   eta(1) aldehyde state that is bound to the surface through its oxygen
   lone pair. Benzaldehyde also reacts with surface oxygen to produce
   benzoate (PhCOO-). Shifts in the OCO stretching frequency suggest that
   the benzoate orientation changes as the surface becomes less crowded,
   consistent with a strong interaction between the phenyl group and the
   surface. Adsorbed benzaldehyde and benzoate undergo decomposition to CO
   and CO2, respectively, as well as benzene. Deoxygenation of benzyl
   alcohol to toluene occurs at high coverages of benzyl alcohol when the
   relative surface O coverage is low. Experiments conducted on
   O-18/Pd(111) reveal exchange occurring between surface O and the
   benzaldehyde and benzoate intermediates. This exchange has not been
   reported for other alcohols, suggesting that aromatic binding effects
   strongly influence alcohol oxidation on Pd.}},

Abstract = {{The identification and quantification of methane emissions from natural
   gas production has become increasingly important owing to the increase
   in the natural gas component of the energy sector. An instrumented
   aircraft platform was used to identify large sources of methane and
   quantify emission rates in southwestern PA in June 2012. A large
   regional flux, 2.0-14 g CH4 s(-1) km(-2), was quantified for a similar
   to 2,800-km(2) area, which did not differ statistically from a bottom-up
   inventory, 2.3-4.6 g CH4 s(-1) km(-2). Large emissions averaging 34 g
   CH4/s per well were observed from seven well pads determined to be in
   the drilling phase, 2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than US
   Environmental Protection Agency estimates for this operational phase.
   The emissions from these well pads, representing similar to 1\% of the
   total number of wells, account for 4-30\% of the observed regional flux.
   More work is needed to determine all of the sources of methane emissions
   from natural gas production, to ascertain why these emissions occur and
   to evaluate their climate and atmospheric chemistry impacts.}},

Abstract = {{DAURE (Determination of the Sources of Atmospheric Aerosols in Urban and
   Rural Environments in the Western Mediterranean) was a multidisciplinary
   international field campaign aimed at investigating the sources and
   meteorological controls of particulate matter in the Western
   Mediterranean Basin (WMB). Measurements were simultaneously performed at
   an urban-coastal (Barcelona, BCN) and a rural-elevated (Montseny, MSY)
   site pair in NE Spain during winter and summer. State-of-the-art methods
   such as C-14 analysis, proton-transfer reaction mass spectrometry, and
   high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry were applied for the first
   time in the WMB as part of DAURE. WMB regional pollution episodes were
   associated with high concentrations of inorganic and organic species
   formed during the transport to inland areas and built up at regional
   scales. Winter pollutants accumulation depended on the degree of
   regional stagnation of an air mass under anticyclonic conditions and the
   planetary boundary layer height. In summer, regional recirculation and
   biogenic secondary organic aerosols (SOA) formation mainly determined
   the regional pollutant concentrations. The contribution from fossil
   sources to organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC) and
   hydrocarbon-like organic aerosol concentrations were higher at BCN
   compared with MSY due to traffic emissions. The relative contribution of
   nonfossil OC was higher at MSY especially in summer due to biogenic
   emissions. The fossil OC/EC ratio at MSY was twice the corresponding
   ratio at BCN indicating that a substantial fraction of fossil OC was due
   to fossil SOA. In winter, BCN cooking emissions were identified as an
   important source of modern carbon in primary organic aerosol.}},

Abstract = {{Probing the collective spin state of an ensemble of atoms may provide a
   means to reduce heating via the photon recoil associated with the
   measurement and provide a robust, scalable route for preparing highly
   entangled states with spectroscopic sensitivity below the standard
   quantum limit for coherent spin states. The collective probing relies on
   obtaining a very large optical depth that can be effectively increased
   by placing the ensemble within an optical cavity such that the probe
   light passes many times through the ensemble. Here we provide
   expressions for measurement resolution and spectroscopic enhancement in
   such cavity- aided nondemolition measurements as a function of the
   cavity detuning. In particular, fundamental limits on spectroscopic
   enhancements in Rb-87 are considered.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of
   thiophene-based conjugated oligomers to elucidate how the oligomer
   architecture, specifically the orientation and density of alkyl side
   chains extending from the thiophene backbones, impacts the
   order-disorder temperatures and the various ordered morphologies that
   the oligomers form. We find that the orientation of side chains along
   the oligomer backbone plays a more significant role than side chain
   density, side chain-side chain interactions, or side chain length in
   determining the thermodynamically stable morphologies and the phase
   transition temperatures. Oligomers with side chains oriented on both
   sides of the backbone ({''}anti{''}) form lamellae, while oligomers with
   side chains oriented on one side of the backbone ({''}syn{''}) assemble
   into hexagonally packed cylinders that can undergo a second, lower
   temperature transition to lamellae or ribbons depending on side
   chain-side chain interaction strength. The strength of side chain-side
   chain interactions affects the order-disorder temperature, with
   oligomers having moderately attractive side chains exhibiting higher
   transition temperatures than those with weakly attractive side chains.
   Side chain length modulates the spacing between morphological features,
   such as cylinders and lamellae, and affects the order-disorder
   temperature differently depending on oligomer architecture.}},

Title = {{Simulation study of the effects of surface chemistry and temperature on
   the conformations of ssDNA oligomers near hydrophilic and hydrophobic
   surfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{We study the effects of the presence of a hydrophilic and a hydrophobic
   surface on the conformations and interactions of a single-stranded DNA
   (ssDNA) oligomer using atomistic molecular dynamics, umbrella sampling,
   and temperature-replica exchange. Our simulations capture the expected
   interactions between the ssDNA and the two surfaces (e.g., hydrogen
   bonds, hydrophobic interactions), but we find that the surface chemistry
   does not strongly affect the exposure of the relatively hydrophobic
   nucleobases or the hydrophilic phosphate backbone in a 16-base ssDNA.
   Likewise, the surfaces do not strongly affect the preferred size of the
   ssDNA compared to bulk solution, although the hydrophilic surface does
   favor slightly more compact ssDNA conformations than the hydrophobic
   surface. In more compact conformations, the negative charge of the ssDNA
   is more concentrated, and the energetic interactions of the DNA and
   DNA-bound counterions with the hydrophilic surface are more favorable,
   which consequently favors smaller ssDNA sizes. Increasing temperature,
   regardless of the presence or chemistry of a surface, makes it less
   unfavorable for the ssDNA to assume both compact and extended
   conformations. With increasing temperature the free energy cost of
   assuming a compact conformation is reduced to a greater extent than the
   cost of assuming an extended conformation. The reason for this
   difference is the entropically favorable release of DNA-bound water
   molecules upon assuming a compact conformation. Increasing temperature
   decreases water-DNA interactions while surprisingly increasing
   counterion-DNA interactions, changes which are attributed to the
   relative balance of entropic and energetic contributions for water
   molecules and counterions bound to the ssDNA. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

   a self-consistent 3-D quasi-neutral hybrid simulation where ions are
   modeled as particles and electrons as a charge-neutralizing fluid.
   Especially, we consider the origin of the recently observed electric
   potentials at lunar magnetic anomalies. An antimoonward Hall electric
   field forms in our simulation resulting in a potential difference of <
   300V on the lunar surface, in which the value is similar to
   observations. Since the hybrid model assumes charge neutrality, our
   results suggest that the electric potentials at lunar magnetic anomalies
   can be formed by decoupling of ion and electron motion even without
   charge separation.}},

Abstract = {{The relativistic electrons in the inner radiation belt have received
   little attention in the past due to sparse measurements and unforgiving
   contamination from the inner belt protons. The high-quality measurements
   of the Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer instrument onboard Van Allen
   Probes provide a great opportunity to investigate the dynamics of
   relativistic electrons in the low L region. In this letter, we report
   the newly unveiled pitch angle distribution (PAD) of the energetic
   electrons with minima at 90 degrees near the magnetic equator in the
   inner belt and slot region. Such a PAD is persistently present
   throughout the inner belt and appears in the slot region during storms.
   One hypothesis for 90 degrees minimum PADs is that off 90 degrees
   electrons are preferentially heated by chorus waves just outside the
   plasmapause (which can be at very low L during storms) and/or fast
   magnetosonic waves which exist both inside and outside the plasmasphere.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate how the interplay between surface-generated
   tidal components and those excited by longitudinally varying solar
   absorption due to dust can explain the seasonal asymmetry of
   nonmigrating tides as seen in middle-atmosphere Mars Climate Sounder's
   observations. This seasonal asymmetry, which is consistent in all 3
   years of available observations, is not readily explained by the current
   theory of nonmigrating tides on Mars. Sources traditionally include the
   changes in the Martian topography and the nonuniformity of the surface
   thermal properties. We show that the seasonal asymmetry can be explained
   by the destructive interference from an asymmetric tidal component
   forced by the wave number patterns in dust opacity in the northern low
   latitudes.}},

Title = {{Network connectivity modulates power spectrum scale invariance}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{436-448}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Measures of complexity are sensitive in detecting disease, which has
   made them attractive candidates for diagnostic biomarkers; one
   complexity measure that has shown promise in fMRI is power spectrum
   scale invariance (PSSI). Even if scale-free features of neuroimaging
   turn out to be diagnostically useful, however, their underlying
   neurobiological basis is poorly understood. Using modeling and
   simulations of a schematic prefrontal-limbic meso-circuit, with
   excitatory and inhibitory networks of nodes, we present here a framework
   for how network density within a control system can affect the
   complexity of signal outputs. Our model demonstrates that scale-free
   behavior, similar to that observed in fMRI PSSI data, can be obtained
   for sufficiently large networks in a context as simple as a linear
   stochastic system of differential equations, although the scale-free
   range improves when introducing more realistic, nonlinear behavior in
   the system. PSSI values (reflective of complexity) vary as a function of
   both input type (excitatory, inhibitory) and input density (mean number
   of long-range connections, or strength), independent of their
   node-specific geometric distribution. Signals show pink noise (1/j)
   behavior when excitatory and inhibitory influences are balanced. As
   excitatory inputs are increased and decreased, signals shift towards
   white and brown noise, respectively. As inhibitory inputs are increased
   and decreased, signals shift towards brown and white noise,
   respectively. The results hold qualitatively at the hemodynamic scale,
   which we modeled by introducing a neurovascular component. Comparing
   hemodynamic simulation results to fMRI PSSI results from 96 individuals
   across a wide spectrum of anxiety-levels, we show how our model can
   generate concrete and testable hypotheses for understanding how
   connectivity affects regulation of meso-circuits in the brain. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Wood waste is a renewable resource that can be recycled for
   particleboard production or energy production. Particleboard is the most
   common product of wood waste recycling, and energy production using
   biomass has been highlighted for energy recovery and the reduction of
   greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate the environmental benefits of particle board production and
   energy production using wood wastes. The system expansion method was
   applied to the quantification of the environmental benefit of two
   different recycling systems. Life cycle assessment methodology was used
   to analyze the environmental impacts of the systems, and the functional
   unit was 1 tonne of wood wastes. The results for both recycling systems
   showed that the particleboard from wood wastes produces -428 kg CO2-eq
   compared to particleboard from fresh woods, and the energy production
   using wood wastes is -154 kg CO2-eq compared to that of the combined
   heat and power generation process. The concept of temporary biomass
   carbon storage was applied to the study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{We study the spectral approximation properties of finite element and

   approximations and discover that the L-2-norm errors for finite element
   eigenfunctions exhibit pronounced ``spikes{''} about the transition
   points between branches of the eigenvalue spectrum. This pathology is
   absent in NURBS approximations. By way of the Pythagorean eigenvalue
   error theorem, we determine that the squares of the energy-norm errors
   of the eigenfunctions are the sums of the eigenvalue errors and the
   squares of the L-2-norm eigenfunction errors. The spurious behavior of
   the higher eigenvalues for standard finite elements is well-known and
   therefore inherited by the energy-norm errors along with the spikes in
   the L-2-norm of the eigenfunction errors. The eigenvalue pathology is
   absent for NURBS. The implications of these results to the corresponding
   elliptic boundary-value problem and parabolic and hyperbolic
   initial-value problems are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{The classical Laplace plane is a frozen orbit, or equilibrium solution
   for the averaged dynamics arising from Earth oblateness and lunisolar
   gravitational perturbations. The pole of the orbital plane of
   uncontrolled GEO satellites regress around the pole of the Laplace plane
   at nearly constant inclination and rate. In accordance with Friesen et
   al. (1993), we show how this stable plane can be used as a robust
   long-term disposal orbit. The current graveyard regions for end-of-life
   retirement of GEO payloads, which is several hundred kilometers above
   GEO depending on the spacecraft characteristics, cannot contain the
   newly discovered high area-to-mass ratio debris population. Such objects
   are highly susceptible to the effects of solar radiation pressure
   exhibiting dramatic variations in eccentricity and inclination over
   short periods of time. The Laplace plane graveyard, on the contrary,
   would trap this debris and would not allow these objects to rain down
   through GEO. Since placing a satellite in this inclined orbit can be
   expensive, we discuss some alternative disposal schemes that have
   acceptable cost-to-benefit ratios. (C) 2014 COSPAR. Published by

Title = {{Effect of a macromolecular- or bio-fouling layer on membrane
   distillation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{456}},
Pages = {{66-76}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Membrane distillation (MD) is a continuous process whereby a hot aqueous
   teed provides the latent heat to vaporize water that diffuses through a
   hydrophobic microporous membrane and condenses. MD is attractive for
   saline and wastewater treatment as well as concentrating heat-sensitive
   solutions such as fruit juices and biological fluids since it operates
   at moderate temperatures and atmospheric pressure, rejects particulates
   and nonvolatile solutes, uses non-selective membranes, and has low
   capital costs. However, MD and MD bioreactor (MDBR) performance is
   compromised by fouling. The effect of fouling layers with reasonably
   large pores (> 50 nm) is reasonably well-understood and has been
   incorporated into MD models. However, the effect of fouling layers with
   very small pores or free volume (< 50 nm) owing to macromolecular- and
   bio-fouling (MMBF) is not well-understood. While MMBF introduces an
   additional resistance to heat transfer, it can also reduce the
   vapor-pressure driving force. This latter effect is unique to MD fouled
   by MMBF. In this analysis the vapor pressure reduction has been
   incorporated into a model that indicates the large flux declines
   observed in prior studies can be explained by the vapor-pressure
   reduction associated with pore diameters ranging from 3.9 to 8.5 nm,
   which agree well with evapoporometry characterization of MMBF sludges.
   The predicted flux decline and temperature polarization coefficient
   indicate that the vapor-pressure reduction increases markedly for
   effective pore diameters less than 10 nm, but can be mitigated by
   increasing the thermal resistance of the membrane and by fabricating a
   dual-layer membrane for which the feed side is hydrophilic with
   relatively large pores. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Influence of dissolved air on the effectiveness of cyclic backwashing in
   submerged membrane systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{456}},
Pages = {{77-84}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Backwashing of submerged hollow fiber membranes has been observed to
   have an unstable impact on the recovery of the membrane permeability.
   Modeling and experimental results in this study show that the
   effectiveness of fixed backwash cycles can decrease over time and reach
   a point at which the backwash effectiveness suddenly decreases. Evidence
   from transmembrane pressure (TMP) monitoring suggests that the sudden
   decrease in backwash efficiency occurs when the pressure on the permeate
   side of the membrane at the end of a backwash cycle does not reach the
   atmospheric pressure maintained On the teed side. The release of
   dissolved air on the permeate side of the membrane due to the pressure
   drop across the membrane was recognized as a major reason for reducing
   backwash effectiveness. The mathematical model predicts that the minimum
   backwash duration required to reverse the flow through the membrane by
   increasing the permeate-side pressure up to atmospheric pressure depends
   on the pressure at the beginning of the backwash, backwash flow rate,
   amount of air on the permeate side, membrane surface area, water
   viscosity, temperature, and the membrane and fouling resistances. These
   findings have implications for the design and operation of submerged
   membranes with backwash. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved}},

Title = {{Separating molecules by size in SAPO-34 membranes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{456}},
Pages = {{185-191}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{SAPO-34 membranes that have CO2/CH4 separation selectivities of similar
   to 100 at 295 K and pressures up to 4.6 MPa also show high molecular
   sieving separations of mixtures containing i-butane (0.50-nm kinetic
   diameter) or CF4 (0.47 nm). The separation selectivities were
   15,000-20,000 for CO2/i-butane from 295 to 420 K, and 12,000-20,000 for
   CO2/CF4 for feed pressures up to 0.5 MPa at 295 K. These may be the
   highest gas-phase separation selectivities reported for zeolite
   membranes, and they are likely lower limits because of concentration
   polarization, leakage around O-rings, and i-butane diffusion through the
   silicone O-rings. The low defect concentration was also confirmed by
   spatial defect distributions measured with i-butane. Thus, less than 1\%
   of the CH4 permeation during CO2/CH4 separations is through defects
   larger than 0.47 nm. Isobutane, even though it is too large to adsorb in
   SAPO-34 pores (0.38-nm diameter), appeared to inhibit CO2 permeation by
   adsorbing on the external surface. These SAPO-34 membranes also
   separated H-2/i-butane with lower limits on selectivities of 6000 at 295
   K and 10,000-14,000 at 423 K, and they were also selective for He/CH4
   separation (selectivity=20) and H-2/CH4 separation (selectivity=35-45).
   In these separations, both He and H-2 appear to speed up CH4 permeation,
   as expected from molecular simulations reported previously. Also, CH4
   appears to slow diffusion of CO2, He, and H-2. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Ultrathin polymers have recently been shown to exhibit different chain
   dynamics and physical properties, as compared to their bulk
   counterparts. In this work, we measure the effective cross-plane thermal
   conductivity of polystyrene (PS) thin films using the ultrafast
   laser-based frequency-dependent time-domain thermoreflectance method.
   The effective thermal conductivity of PS films is found to increase with
   decreasing film thickness when the thickness of the PS film is
   comparable to or smaller than the radius of gyration of bulk PS. By
   correlating the effective thermal conductivity with the ratio of the
   film thickness to radius of gyration, we find that this increase is
   mainly due to the increase of interfacial thermal conductance between PS
   thin film and the substrate, which likely results from the changing
   chain structure near the PS/substrate interface. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Assembly of diblock copolymer functionalized spherical nanoparticles as
   a function of copolymer composition}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{14}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to
   study spherical nanoparticles functionalized with AB diblock copolymer
   chains at low grafting density, to obtain a design library linking
   copolymer composition, monomer-monomer interaction strengths, graft
   lengths, particle sizes, and monomer solvent-philicity to the two stages
   of nanoparticle assembly: the initial formation of patches within the
   copolymer-grafted particles from attractive monomers aggregating, and
   then the (equilibrium) assembled cluster formation. With regards to
   patch formation, as the fraction of the solvent-phobic (A or B) block
   decreases along the graft and the interaction strength decreases, the
   propensity to form patches on the particles decreases. As the fraction
   of the solvent-phobic block increases, the time for patch formation
   decreases, in particular if the inner A block is solvent-phobic. As the
   ratio of graft length to particle size increases the propensity to form
   fewer patches increases due to inter-graft monomer aggregation. For all
   compositions, the assembled clusters formed in B-selective solvents
   (solvent-phobic A block) have a higher fraction of particles at smaller
   inter-particle distances than in A-selective solvents (solvent-phobic B
   block). In an A-selective solvent at low interaction strengths, as the
   graft length to particle diameter ratio is increased, the tendency to
   form isotropic clusters at equilibrium is increased, and intermediate
   anisotropic chain-like assembly is observed. When these anisotropic
   intermediate states are observed, they accelerate the formation of
   equilibrium isotropic clusters. With increasing strength of interaction
   between solvent-phobic B monomers, the intermediate states disappear
   from the assembly pathway. At low and intermediate interaction
   strengths, as fraction of A block increases, the clusters' outer shell
   of solvent-philic A monomers which surrounds the patch of solvent-phobic
   B monomers becomes dense, hindering addition of more particles to the
   cluster leading to smaller overall clusters. In a B-selective solvent,
   predominantly anisotropic clusters form, and show an increase in shape
   anisotropy with increasing monomer interaction strength. In both cases
   of monomer solvent-philicity, with an increase in the graft length to
   particle diameter ratio we see a decrease in anisotropic cluster
   formation. And, in both cases of monomer solvent philicity, with
   increasing monomer interaction strength the average cluster size and
   tendency to form anisotropic clusters is increased. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{We discuss a strategy to construct corotated frames for
   three-dimensional continuum finite elements by minimizing deformations
   within the frame. We find that irrespective of the type of element and
   the number of nodes, using a quaternion parametrization of rotations,
   this minimization is naturally stated as computing the smallest
   eigenvalue of a 4 x 4 matrix. The simplicity of this smallest eigenvalue
   plays a crucial role when linearizing the kinematics. Ensuant quaternion
   algebra, although lengthy, results in remarkably simple formulas for
   projections that arise in the linearized kinematics. The exact stiffness
   matrix does not require computation of the second derivative of the
   rotation function and is also given by a simple formula. As a result,
   the implementation of this corotational formulation becomes particularly
   straightforward. Furthermore, in contrast to other results in the
   literature, the stiffness matrix for elements with translational DOFs is
   symmetric. For illustration, this corotational formulation is applied to
   a solid-shell finite element, and numerical results are presented.

Title = {{Transverse-energy distributions at midrapidity in p plus p, d plus Au,

Abstract = {{Measurements of the midrapidity transverse-energy distribution, dE(T)/d
   eta, are presented for p + p, d+Au, and Au+Au collisions atv root s(NN)
   = 200 GeV and additionally for Au+Au collisions atv root s(NN) = 62.4
   and 130 GeV. The dE(T)/d eta distributions are first compared with the
   number of nucleon participants N-part, number of binary collisions
   N-coll, and number of constituent-quark participants N-qp calculated
   from a Glauber model based on the nuclear geometry. For Au+Au, < dE(T)/d
   eta >/N-part increases with N-part, while < dE(T)/d eta >/N-qp is
   approximately constant for all three energies. This indicates that the
   two-component ansatz, dE(T)/d eta alpha (1 - x)N-part/2 + xN(coll),
   which was used to represent E-T distributions, is simply a proxy for
   N-qp, and that the N-coll term does not represent a hard-scattering
   component in E-T distributions. The dE(T)/d eta distributions of Au+Au
   and d+Au are then calculated from the measured p + p E-T distribution
   using two models that both reproduce the Au+Au data. However, while the
   number-of-constituent-quark-participant model agrees well with the d+Au
   data, the additive-quark model does not.}},

Abstract = {{Orthogonal, sequential ``click{''} reactions were implemented to yield
   novel polymeric substrates with the ability to record holographic data.
   The base-catalyzed thiol-acrylate Michael ``click{''} reaction was
   implemented to yield a writable, stage 1 polymeric substrate with glass
   transition temperatures (T-g) ranging from 0 to -26 degrees C and
   rubbery storage moduli (E') from 11.1 to 0.3 MPa. The loosely
   cross-linked matrix also contained a novel high refractive index monomer
   9-(2,3-bis(allyloxy)propyl)-9H-carbazole (BAPC) that did not participate
   in the thiol-Michael reaction but allowed for large index gradients to
   be developed within the network upon subsequent exposure to coherent
   laser beams and initiation of the radical-mediated thiol-ene reaction.
   The holographic gratings were recorded with 96\% diffraction efficiency
   and ca. 2.4 cm/mJ of light sensitivity in 2 s under a 405 nm exposure
   with an intensity of 20 mW/cm(2). Subsequent to pattern formation, via a
   thiol-allyl radical ``click{''} photopolymerization initiated by flood
   illumination of the sample, holographic materials with high T-g, high
   modulus, diffraction efficiency as high as 82\%, and refractive index
   modulation of 0.004 were obtained. Graded rainbow holograms that
   displayed colors from blue to red at a single viewing angle were readily
   formed through this new technique.}},

Abstract = {{Rheological and small molecule kinetic studies were performed to study
   the formation and hydrolysis of the bis-aliphatic hydrazone bond. The
   rate of gelation was found to correspond closely with the rate of bond
   formation and the rate of gel relaxation with the rate of hydrolysis,
   indicating that small molecule kinetic studies can play an important
   role in material design. Furthermore, unlike aryl or acyl hydrazone
   bonds, the bis-aliphatic hydrazone bond forms rapidly under
   physiological conditions without requiring aniline catalysis yet
   maintains a pH-dependent rate of hydrolysis. These results suggest the
   bis-aliphatic hydrazone bond should find use alongside existing
   bioorthogonal click chemistries for bioconjugation, biomaterial
   synthesis, and controlled release applications.}},

Abstract = {{Landsat 8, a NASA and USGS collaboration, acquires global
   moderate-resolution measurements of the Earth's terrestrial and polar
   regions in the visible, near-infrared, short wave, and thermal infrared.
   Landsat 8 extends the remarkable 40 year Landsat record and has enhanced
   capabilities including new spectral bands in the blue and cirrus
   cloud-detection portion of the spectrum, two thermal bands, improved
   sensor signal-to-noise performance and associated improvements in
   radiometric resolution, and an improved duty cycle that allows
   collection of a significantly greater number of images per day. This
   paper introduces the current (2012-2017) Landsat Science Team's efforts
   to establish an initial understanding of Landsat 8 capabilities and the
   steps ahead in support of priorities identified by the team. Preliminary
   evaluation of Landsat 8 capabilities and identification of new science
   and applications opportunities are described with respect to calibration
   and radiometric characterization; surface reflectance; surface albedo;
   surface temperature, evapotranspiration and drought; agriculture; land
   cover, condition, disturbance and change; fresh and coastal water; and
   snow and ice. Insights into the development of derived `higher-lever
   Landsat products are provided in recognition of the growing need for
   consistently processed, moderate spatial resolution, large area,
   long-term terrestrial data records for resource management and for
   climate and global change studies. The paper concludes with future
   prospects, emphasizing the opportunities for land imaging constellations
   by combining Landsat data with data collected from other international
   sensing systems, and consideration of successor Landsat mission
   requirements. (c) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{To address the critical need for improving the chemical characterization
   of the organic composition of ambient particulate matter, we introduce a
   combined thermal desorption aerosol gas chromatograph-aerosol mass
   spectrometer (TAG-AMS). The TAG system provides in-situ speciation of
   organic chemicals in ambient aerosol particles with hourly time
   resolution for marker compounds indicative of sources and transformation
   processes. However, by itself the TAG cannot separate by particle size
   and it typically speciates and quantifies only a fraction of the organic
   aerosol (OA) mass. The AMS is a real-time, in-situ instrument that
   provides quantitative size distributions and mass loadings for ambient
   fine OA and major inorganic fractions; however, by itself the AMS has
   limited ability for identification of individual organic compounds due
   to the electron impact ionization detection scheme used without prior
   molecular separation.
   The combined TAG-AMS system provides real-time detection by AMS followed
   by semicontinuous analysis of the TAG sample that was acquired during
   AMS operation, achieving simultaneous and complementary measurements of
   quantitative organic mass loading and detailed organic speciation. We
   have employed a high-resolution time-of-flight mass spectrometer
   (HR-ToF-MS) to enable elemental-level determination of OA oxidation
   state as measured on the AMS, and to allow improved compound
   identification and separation of unresolved complex mixtures (UCM)
   measured on the TAG. The TAG-AMS interface has been developed as an
   upgrade for existing AMS systems. Such measurements will improve the
   identification of organic constituents of ambient aerosol and contribute
   to the ability of atmospheric chemistry models to predict ambient
   aerosol composition and loadings.

Abstract = {{We reconstruct the gravitational lensing convergence signal from cosmic
   microwave background (CMB) polarization data taken by the POLARBEAR
   experiment and cross-correlate it with cosmic infrared background maps
   from the Herschel satellite. From the cross spectra, we obtain evidence
   for gravitational lensing of the CMB polarization at a statistical
   significance of 4.0 sigma and indication of the presence of a lensing
   B-mode signal at a significance of 2.3 sigma. We demonstrate that our
   results are not biased by instrumental and astrophysical systematic
   errors by performing null tests, checks with simulated and real data,
   and analytical calculations. This measurement of polarization lensing,
   made via the robust cross-correlation channel, not only reinforces
   POLARBEAR auto-correlation measurements, but also represents one of the
   early steps towards establishing CMB polarization lensing as a powerful
   new probe of cosmology and astrophysics.}},

Abstract = {{Recent instrumentation can distinguish various types of aerosol
   particles in the stratosphere and determine their relative abundance. In
   the background lower stratosphere between major volcanic eruptions, most
   particles are either relatively pure sulphuric acid, sulphuric acid with
   material from ablated meteoroids or mixed organic-sulphate particles
   that originated in the troposphere. The meteoritic iron and magnesium
   appear to be dissolved whereas the aluminum and silicon appear to be
   inclusions. Most stratospheric aerosol mass is liquid sulphuric acid and
   associated water, but a large fraction of particles contain either
   inclusions of meteoritic elements such as silicon or organic material
   that is probably effloresced or glassy. These solid phases could have
   large but unknown implications for the ability of particles to act as
   freezing nuclei for polar stratospheric clouds. Internally mixed black
   carbon is a measurable but very small component of the stratospheric
   aerosol by mass. Despite their importance for heterogeneous chemistry,
   there are few quantitative measurements of halogens in stratospheric
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{The modulation of nonmigrating tides on both the ionospheric equatorial
   ionization anomaly (EIA) and the equatorial thermosphere anomaly (ETA)
   is investigated on the basis of simulations from the Thermosphere
   Ionosphere Mesosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model
   (TIME-GCM). Our simulations demonstrate the distinct features of the EIA
   and ETA seen in observations after the inclusion of field-aligned ion
   drag in the model. Both the EIA and the ETA in the constant local time
   frame display an obvious zonal wave-4 structure associated with the
   modulation of nonmigrating tides. However, the modeled EIA and ETA show
   a primary zonal wave-1 structure when only the migrating tides are
   specified at the model lower boundary. Our simulations reveal that the
   zonal wave-4 structure of the ETA under both low and high solar activity
   conditions is mainly caused by the direct response of the upper
   thermosphere to the diurnal eastward wave number 3 and semidiurnal
   eastward wave number 2 nonmigrating tides from the lower atmosphere.
   There is a minor contribution from the ion-neutral coupling. The zonal
   wave-4 structure of the EIA is also caused by these nonmigrating tides
   but through the modulation of the neutral wind dynamo.}},

Abstract = {{The parameterizations of monoenergetic particle impact ionization in
   Fang et al. (2010) (Fang2010) and Fang et al. (2013) (Fang2013) are
   applied to the complex energy spectra measured by DMSP F16 satellite to
   calculate the ionization rates from electron and ion precipitations for
   a Northern Hemisphere pass from 0030 UT to 0106 UT on 6 August 2011.
   Clear enhancement of electron flux is found in the polar cap. The mean
   electron energy in the polar cap is mostly above 100eV, while the mean
   energy in the auroral zone is typically above 1keV. At the same time,
   F16 captures a strong Poynting flux enhancement in the polar cap, which
   is comparable to those in the auroral zone. The particle impact
   ionization rates using Fang2010 and Fang2013 parameterizations show
   clear enhancement at F region altitudes mainly due to the low-energy
   precipitating electrons, peaking probably in the cusp but also showing
   enhanced levels throughout most of the polar cap region. The general
   circulation models (GCMs), National Center for Atmospheric Research
   Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model, and
   Global Ionosphere-Thermosphere Model, using their default empirical
   formulations of particle impact ionization, do not capture the observed
   features shown in the total particle ionization rate applying the
   Fang2010 and Fang2013 parameterizations to DMSP measurements. The
   difference between GCM simulations and Fang2010 and Fang2013 applied to
   DMSP data is due to the difference of both the inputs to the models and
   the parameterization of the ionization rates.}},

Title = {{Impacts of Postdam Land Use/Land Cover Changes on Modification of

Abstract = {{Understanding the impact of postdam climate feedbacks, resulting from
   land use/land cover (LULC) variability, on modification of extreme
   precipitation (EP) remains a challenge for a twenty-first-century
   approach to dam design and operation. In this study, the Regional
   Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS, version 6.0) was used, involving a
   number of predefined LULC scenarios to address the important question
   regarding dams and their impoundments: How sensitive are the
   hydroclimatology and terrain features of a region in modulating the
   postdam response of climate feedbacks to EP? The study region covered
   the Owyhee Dam/Reservoir on the Owyhee River watershed (ORW), located in
   eastern Oregon. A systematic perturbation of the relative humidity in
   the initial and boundary condition of the model was carried out to
   simulate EP. Among the different LULC scenarios used in the simulation
   over the ORW, irrigation expansion in the postdam era resulted in an
   increase in EP up to 6\% in the 72-h precipitation total. The
   contribution of the reservoir on EP added 8\% to the 72-h total when
   compared to the predam LULC conditions. To address the science question,
   a previously completed investigation on the Folsom Dam {[}American River
   watershed (ARW)] in California was compared with the ORW findings on the
   basis of contrasting differences in hydroclimatology and terrain
   features. The results indicate that the postdam LULC change scenarios
   impact EP of ORW (Owyhee Dam) much greater than the EP of the ARW
   (Folsom Dam) because of its semiarid climate and flat terrain. EP was
   less sensitive to LULC changes on the windward side of the mountainous
   terrain of ARW as compared to the leeward side of the flat terrain of
   ORW.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We study the gravitational oscillations of liquid confined in a vertical
   tube, immersed in a liquid bath, with air trapped above the liquid
   column. The trapped air acts as a nonlinear spring, in addition to the
   gravitational restoring force. The presence of the trapped air
   introduces two new parameters in the problem. One parameter denoted a
   governs the effect of compression and expansion and the other parameter
   denoted beta governs the effect of initial pressure of the trapped air.
   In the absence of viscosity, the ordinary differential equations
   governing the upward and downward motion of the liquid in the tube are
   different and, considered separately, are conservative. Together,
   however, they describe the damped oscillations due to irreversible
   energy losses at the end of the tube in the bath. Numerical simulations
   show the effects of a and beta on the oscillations. A Shanks approximate
   provides a surprisingly good estimation of the nonlinear damping. Taking
   into account viscous losses, a first order asymptotic analysis provides
   a prediction for the frequency of linear oscillations, in very good
   agreement with experiment. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Solar flares are explosive events on the Sun that release energetic
   particles, X-rays, EUV, and radio emissions that have an almost
   immediate impact on Earth's ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system and/or
   on operational systems that are affected by IT conditions. To assess
   such impacts, it is a key that we know how the ionosphere is modified.
   An objective of this paper is to evaluate how digisondes might serve in
   this role. Toward this end we utilize data from the Millstone Hill
   digisonde to reveal the height versus time bottomside F region responses
   to three X-class flares (X28, X8.3, and X1.7) at a middle latitude site.
   In terms of percent increase with respect to a preflare hourly mean, the
   long-lived (> 15-30 min) responses to these flares maximize between
   about 150 and 250 km and measurably last similar to 0.75-1.5 h after
   flare maximum. The relative magnitudes of these responses are
   complicated by flare position on the solar disk, which determines how
   much of the EUV solar emissions are attenuated by the solar atmosphere.
   At Millstone Hill there was little measurable response to these flares
   near the F-2 layer peak; however, at the magnetic equator location of
   Jicamarca, the F-2 peak electron density increased by similar to
   15-40\%. Herein, all of these flare response characteristics are
   interpreted in terms of available modeling results. We propose that such
   digisonde data, in combination with first-principles models and
   high-resolution measurements of solar EUV flux emissions (e.g., from
   Solar Dynamics Observatory/EUV Variability Experiment), can lead us to a
   deeper understanding of the ionospheric photochemistry and dynamics that
   underlies a predictive capability.}},

Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{183-188}},

Abstract = {{The critical wave number of an ultrasonic slow wave can be directly
   related to the permeability of the porous material. In particular, this
   technique can be used to identify pore closure in a porous medium such
   as a micro-or ultrafiltration membrane. A 10.5 mm-thick porous alumina
   sample was tested using four broadband transducers with central
   frequencies from 1 MHz to 20 MHz. Experimental results demonstrate the
   sensitivity of this method to the change of permeability caused by
   closure of the pores. This technique could be used for the detection of
   membrane fouling, especially for monitoring the development of
   early-stage biofouling. Early-stage biofouling results in a decrease in
   the permeability of a porous material, although the deposited layer is,
   in general, not detectable using ultrasonic methods. A feasibility study
   was carried out in a laboratory-scale flow cell, which was developed to
   simulate the measurement of pore closure under realistic operating
   conditions. A 5 MHz broadband transducer and waveguide were used for
   this testing.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their unique properties, nanomaterials have been actively
   investigated in recent years for biosensing applications. A typical
   approach for biomarker detection is to attach capture or detection
   antibodies to nanomaterials, allow the analyte to bind, and measure the
   resulting change in signal. While antibodies or aptamers possess at most
   one binding site each for the nanomaterial and analyte, it is shown that
   the high surface area filamentous M13 bacteriophage can be utilized as a
   scaffold for generating an amplified signal. Since only a few proteins
   at the tip of the micrometer-long virus are involved in antigen binding,
   the rest of the bacteriophage can be augmented with hundreds of
   functional groups, each of which can bind to a specific nanomaterial. It
   is demonstrated that the combination of DNA-modified M13 bacteriophage
   and surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) active nanoparticles can
   be used to produce exponential gains in Raman signal compared to that of
   antibodies at the same antigen concentration. Because of these high
   sensitivities, Raman measurements can be made directly from individual
   silica microparticles, potentially enabling future single step
   identification and analysis of different proteins in complex mixtures,
   while avoiding additional processing steps or prepatterned microarrays.}},

Abstract = {{Postural control is significantly affected by the postural base of
   support; however, the effects on postural adaptation are not well
   understood. Here we investigated how adaptation and transfer of
   anticipatory postural control are affected by stance width. Subjects
   made reaching movements in a novel dynamic environment while holding the
   handle of a force-generating robotic arm. Each subject initially adapted
   to the dynamics while standing in a wide stance and then switched to a
   narrow stance, or vice versa. Our hypothesis is that anticipatory
   postural control, reflected in center of pressure ( COP) movement, is
   not affected by stance width, as long as the control remains within
   functional limits; therefore we predicted that subjects in either stance
   would show similar COP movement by the end of adaptation and immediately
   upon transfer to the other stance. We found that both groups showed
   similar adaptation of postural control, by using different muscle
   activation strategies to account for the differing stance widths. One
   group, after adapting in wide stance, transferred similar postural
   control to narrow stance, by modifying their muscle activity to account
   for the new stance. Interestingly, the other group showed an increase in
   postural control when transferring from narrow to wide stance,
   associated with no change in muscle activity. These results confirm that
   adaptation of anticipatory postural control is not affected by stance
   width, as long as the control remains within biomechanical limits.
   However, transfer of control between stance widths is affected by the
   initial context in which the task is learned.}},

   wholly satisfactory. A palatable measure of intersection information
   would provide a principled way to quantify slippery concepts, such as
   synergy. Here, we introduce an intersection information measure based on
   the Gacs-Korner common random variable that is the first to satisfy the
   coveted target monotonicity property. Our measure is imperfect, too, and
   we suggest directions for improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular layer deposition (MLD) is a sequential and self-limiting
   process that may be used to create hybrid organic/inorganic thin films
   from organometallic precursors and organic alcohol precursors. In this
   study, films of a zirconium-containing hybrid organic/inorganic polymer
   known as zircone were grown on nanoporous alumina using MLD. Scanning
   electron microscopy data showed obliteration of the pores in
   zircone-coated nanoporous alumina. An in vitro cell viability study
   indicated that the growth of human epidermal keratinocytes was the
   greatest on zircone-coated nanoporous alumina than on uncoated
   nanoporous alumina. Our results suggest that MLD may be used to create
   biocompatible coatings for use in many types of medical devices.}},

   International projects were popular among civil engineering students on
   two course assignments. Final reflective essays revealed that 20\% of

   students, respectively, were interested in working abroad. In a 2011
   survey, all civil engineering students indicated at least some level of
   interest in working on engineering projects outside the U.S. during

Title = {{Controlling the Surface Environment of Heterogeneous Catalysts Using
   Self-Assembled Monolayers}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1438-1445}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Rationally designing and producing suitable catalysts to promote
   specific reaction pathways remains a major objective in heterogeneous
   catalysis. One approach involves using traditional catalytic materials
   modified with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) to create a more
   favorable surface environment for specific product formation. A major
   advantage of SAM-based modifiers is their tendency to form consistent,
   highly ordered assembly structures on metal surfaces. In addition, both
   the attachment chemistry and tail structures can easily be tuned to
   facilitate specific interactions between reactants and the catalyst. In
   this Account, we summarize our recent modification approaches for tuning
   monolayer structure to improve catalytic performance for hydrogenation
   reactions on palladium and platinum catalysts. Each approach serves to
   direct selectivity by tuning a particular aspect of the system including
   the availability of specific active sites (active-site selection),
   intermolecular interactions between the reactants and modifiers
   (molecular recognition), and general steric or crowding effects.
   We have demonstrated that the tail moiety can be tuned to control the
   density of SAM modifiers on the surface. Infrared spectra of adsorbed CO
   probe molecules reveal that increasing the density of the thiols
   restricts the availability of contiguous active sites on catalyst
   terraces while maintaining accessibility to sites located at particle
   edges and steps. This technique was utilized to direct selectivity for
   the hydrogenation of furfural. Results obtained from SAM coatings with
   different surface densities indicated that, for this reaction, formation
   of the desirable products occurs primarily at particle edges and steps,
   whereas the undesired pathway occurs on particle terrace sites. As an
   alternative approach, the tail structure of the SAM precursor can be
   tuned to promote specific intermolecular interactions between the
   modifier and reactant in order to position reactant molecules in a
   desired orientation. This technique was utilized for the hydrogenation
   of cinnamaldehyde, which contains an aromatic phenyl moiety. By using a
   phenyl-containing SAM modifier with an appropriate tether length, > 90\%
   selectivity toward reaction of the aldehyde group was achieved. In
   contrast, employing a modifier where the phenyl moiety was closer to the
   catalyst surface biased selectivity toward the hydrogenation of the C=C
   bond due to reorienting the molecule to a more ``lying down{''}
   conformation. In addition to approaches that target specific
   interactions between the reactant and modified catalyst, we have
   demonstrated the use of SAMs to impose a steric or blocking effect, for
   example, during the hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The
   SAMs facilitated hydrogenation of polyunsaturated to monounsaturated
   fatty acids but inhibited further hydrogenation to the completely
   saturated species due to the sterically hindered, single ``kink{''}
   shape of the monounsaturated product.
   The recent contributions discussed in this Account demonstrate the
   significant potential for this approach to design improved catalysts and
   to develop a deeper understanding of mechanistic effects due to the near
   surface environment.}},

Abstract = {{A visible-light base generating system was successfully employed in
   catalyzing the thiol-Michael addition reaction to yield cross-linked

   visible-light photobase generator that improves the orthogonality of the
   thiol-Michael addition with respect to off-stoichiometric radical
   thiol-vinyl addition/vinyl chain reactions. This approach opens up a

Abstract = {{Vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) represent a ubiquitous
   light source with unique performance characteristics that excel for
   edge-emitting lasers or light-emitting diodes. VCSELs are available,
   however, mostly on growth wafers in rigid, planar formats over
   restricted areas, thereby frustrating their use for applications that
   benefit greatly from unconventional design options including
   large-scale, programmable assemblies on unusual substrates, hybrid
   integration with dissimilar materials and devices, or mechanically
   compliant constructions. Here, materials design and fabrication
   strategies are presented to overcome these limitations of conventional
   VCSELs and create new application opportunities that are unavailable
   with existing technologies. Specialized epitaxial design and fabrication
   processes, together with printing-based integration methods, enable
   defect-free release of ultrathin, microscale VCSELs and their
   device-level implementation on non-native substrates in a scalable,
   cost-effective fashion. Demonstrations of large-scale, addressable
   arrays of VCSELs on plastics for flexible near-infrared laser displays,
   and heterogeneous assemblies with silicon-based electronics to form
   integrated optoelectronic sensors, illustrate unique capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the incorporation of hyaluronan (HA) binding
   peptides into poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels as a mechanism to
   bind and retain hyaluronan for applications in tissue engineering. The
   specificity of the peptide sequence (native RYPISRPRKRC vs non-native
   RPSRPRIRYKC), the role of basic amino acids, and specificity to
   hyaluronan over other GAGs in contributing to the peptide-hyaluronan
   interaction were probed through experiments and simulations. Hydrogels
   containing the native or non-native peptide retained hyaluronan in a
   dose-dependent manner. Ionic interactions were the dominating mechanism.
   In diH(2)O the peptides interacted strongly with HA and chondroitin
   sulfate, but in phosphate buffered saline the peptides interacted more
   strongly with HA. For cartilage tissue engineering, chondrocyte-laden
   PEG hydrogels containing increasing amounts of HA binding peptide and
   exogenous HA had increased retention and decreased loss of cell-secreted
   proteoglycans in and from the hydrogel at 28 days. This new

   and BCc (428.6 cm(2) g (1)) is lower than granular activated carbon
   (GAC) (1247.8 m(2) g (1)) but higher than graphite granule (GG) (0.44
   m(2) g (1)). Both biochars showed power outputs of 532 +/- 18 mWm (2)
   (BCp) and 457 +/- 20 mWm (2) (BCc), comparable with GAC (674 +/- 10 mWm
   (2)) and GG (566 +/- 5mW m (2)). However, lower material expenses made
   their power output cost 17-35 US\$ W (1), 90\% cheaper than GAC (402
   US\$ W (1)) or GG (392 US\$ W (1)). Biochar from waste also reduced the
   energy and carbon footprint associated with electrode manufacturing and
   the disposal of which could have additional agronomic benefits. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The recent mountain pine beetle epidemic in the Colorado River Basin has
   resulted in widespread tree mortality in pine stands across the Colorado
   Plateau. Because of complex micro-scale (i.e. tree well scale)
   interactions between vegetation and snow processes, one of the most
   significant issues resulting from this epidemic is the potential
   hydrologic impacts of the effects of changing forest structure. Using
   SNTHERM, we conducted a comparative modelling scenario analysis of the
   snowpack along a transect between two trees over the course of the snow
   ablation season (28 February-30 June) under four forest stand conditions
   to assess changes in snowpack characteristics because of loss of canopy
   biomass. We found that the red phase scenario (intermediate phase of
   tree death) exhibited a 4-day earlier snow disappearance date than the
   living stand scenario and grey phase scenario (advanced phase of tree
   death), although the timing of isothermal conditions at 0 degrees C was
   identical. The modelled clearcut scenario snowpack became isothermal at
   0 degrees C 10days earlier than the living, red phase, or grey phase
   scenarios. The clearcut modelling scenario also exhibited the greatest
   homogenization of snow properties, and the spatio-temporal distribution
   of snow disappearance at the tree well scale was 70\% as variable as the
   living, red phase and grey phase modelling scenarios. These results
   provide insight to the processes responsible for changing hydrologic
   dynamics in snow-dominated forest ecosystems with the onset of
   vegetation stress and death and may help inform future forest management
   strategies. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{A novel antenna composite with greatly extended bandwidth of a baseline
   printed 4-arm log-periodic (LP) topology is introduced. Bandwidth
   increase by accomplishing a miniaturization factor >2 is achieved by
   coupling the currents from the booms of the LP to an annular ring,
   thereby providing an efficient well-matched radiator at frequencies
   below the cut-off frequency of the LP. The annulus, the turnstile (booms
   of the LP), and the LP form the radiators of this novel quasi
   frequency-independent (FI) ring-turnstile-LP antenna. A 160 mm diameter
   antenna is designed and fabricated to demonstrate the proposed concept.
   Measured VSWR and extensive far-field characterization verify
   multi-octave dual circular polarization (CP) operation and a size
   reduction factor of 2.25. Also, the ring-turnstile-LP configuration is
   integrated with two planar impedance transformers/feeds to demonstrate
   small size, simple beamformer and dual-CP operation over bandwidths as
   wide as those of more complex sinuous and singly polarized spiral
   antennas. Detailed computational studies are conducted for better
   understanding the impact of various structural parameters on antenna's
   unidirectional performance and relevant conclusions are provided.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a shielded over-moded conductive cavity for

   conductive and absorptive object loading, and frequency modulation. It
   is found that very small frequency modulation of less than 0.1\% is
   sufficient to provide a practical level of power uniformity. A
   device-under-charge (DUT) consisting of a rectenna, microcontroller,
   power management circuit, solid-state battery, and ISM-band wireless
   transceiver is used to validate the study by monitoring the battery
   charging at various locations within the cavity. The demonstrated

Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{This study presents a centrifuge modeling approach to characterize the
   transient thermomechanical response of energy foundations during
   heating-cooling cycles to provide data for calibration and validation of
   soil-structure interaction models. This study focuses on the response of
   a scale-model energy foundation installed in an unsaturated silt layer
   with end-bearing boundary conditions. The foundation response was
   assessed using embedded strain gauges and thermocouples. Other variables
   monitored include foundation head displacements, soil surface
   displacements, and changes in temperature and volumetric water content
   in the unsaturated silt at different depths and radial locations.
   Measurements during the initial heating process indicate that the
   thermal axial stress is greater near the toe of the foundation as a
   result of the restraint associated with mobilization of side shear
   resistance along the length of the foundation. The thermal axial strains
   were close to the free-expansion thermal strain near the soil surface
   and decreased with depth. The thermal axial displacements calculated by
   integrating the thermal axial strains correspond well with the
   independently measured head displacements. The mobilized side stresses
   calculated from the thermal axial stresses increased with height and
   were consistent with the shear strength of unsaturated silt. During
   successive heating-cooling cycles, slight decreases in upward thermal
   head displacement were observed because of changes in the stiffness of
   the unsaturated soil from thermally induced water flow away from the
   foundation and potential downdrag effects. However, little change in the
   thermal axial stress was observed during the heating-cooling cycles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the application of a Model Predictive Control (MPC)
   system to a solar-thermal reactor for carbon-steam gasification. The
   controller aimed at rejecting the disturbances in solar irradiation,
   caused by the presence of clouds, through the manipulation of the flow
   rates into the reactor. Simulations of a first-principles dynamic model
   were used to fit a linear, time-invariant model, to be used directly in
   the MPC algorithm. The MPC was tuned through simulations, until robust
   control was achieved. The proposed control system was compared to a
   fine-tuned multi-loop feedback control strategy. Simulations of the
   controlled reactor system showed that the linear MPC was capable of
   minimizing the effect of the disturbances within the entire operating
   region, outperforming a more conventional multi-loop feedback strategy.
   The results obtained suggest that the proposed controller is suitable
   for a real-world implementation. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Convection in planetary cores can generate fluid flow and magnetic
   fields, and a number of sophisticated codes exist to simulate the
   dynamic behaviour of such systems. We report on the first community
   activity to compare numerical results of computer codes designed to
   calculate fluid flow within a whole sphere. The flows are incompressible
   and rapidly rotating and the forcing of the flow is either due to
   thermal convection or due to moving boundaries. All problems defined
   have solutions that allow easy comparison, since they are either steady,
   slowly drifting or perfectly periodic. The first two benchmarks are
   defined based on uniform internal heating within the sphere under the
   Boussinesq approximation with boundary conditions that are uniform in
   temperature and stress-free for the flow. Benchmark 1 is purely
   hydrodynamic, and has a drifting solution. Benchmark 2 is a
   magnetohydrodynamic benchmark that can generate oscillatory, purely
   periodic, flows and magnetic fields. In contrast, Benchmark 3 is a
   hydrodynamic rotating bubble benchmark using no slip boundary conditions
   that has a stationary solution. Results from a variety of types of code
   are reported, including codes that are fully spectral (based on
   spherical harmonic expansions in angular coordinates and polynomial
   expansions in radius), mixed spectral and finite difference, finite
   volume, finite element and also a mixed Fourier-finite element code.
   There is good agreement between codes. It is found that in Benchmarks 1
   and 2, the approximation of a whole sphere problem by a domain that is a
   spherical shell (a sphere possessing an inner core) does not represent
   an adequate approximation to the system, since the results differ from
   whole sphere results.}},

Title = {{Inhibition Causes Ceaseless Dynamics in Networks of Excitable Nodes}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The collective dynamics of a network of excitable nodes changes
   dramatically when inhibitory nodes are introduced. We consider
   inhibitory nodes which may be activated just like excitatory nodes but,
   upon activating, decrease the probability of activation of network
   neighbors. We show that, although the direct effect of inhibitory nodes
   is to decrease activity, the collective dynamics becomes
   self-sustaining. We explain this counterintuitive result by defining and
   analyzing a ``branching function{''} which may be thought of as an
   activity-dependent branching ratio. The shape of the branching function
   implies that, for a range of global coupling parameters, dynamics are
   self-sustaining. Within the self-sustaining region of parameter space
   lies a critical line along which dynamics take the form of avalanches
   with universal scaling of size and duration, embedded in a ceaseless
   time series of activity. Our analyses, confirmed by numerical
   simulation, suggest that inhibition may play a counterintuitive role in
   excitable networks.}},

Title = {{Thiol-ene functionalized siloxanes for use as elastomeric dental
   impression materials}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{449-455}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objectives. Thiol- and allyl-functionalized siloxane oligomers are
   synthesized and evaluated for use as a radical-mediated, rapid set
   elastomeric dental impression material. Thiol-ene siloxane formulations
   are crosslinked using a redox-initiated polymerization scheme, and the
   mechanical properties of the thiol-ene network are manipulated through
   the incorporation of varying degrees of plasticizer and kaolin filler.
   Formulations with medium and light body consistencies are further
   evaluated for their ability to accurately replicate features on both the
   gross and microscopic levels. We hypothesize that thiol-ene
   functionalized siloxane systems will exhibit faster setting times and
   greater detail reproduction than commercially available
   polyvinylsiloxane (PVS) materials of comparable consistencies.
   Methods. Thiol-ene functionalized siloxane mixtures formulated with
   varying levels of redox initiators, plasticizer, and kaolin filler are
   made and evaluated for their polymerization speed (FTIR), consistency
   (ISO4823.9.2), and surface energy (goniometer). Feature replication is
   evaluated quantitatively by SEM. The T-g, storage modulus, and creep
   behavior are determined by DMA.
   Results. Increasing redox initiation rate increases the polymerization
   rate but at high levels also limits working time. Combining 0.86 wt\%
   oxidizing agent with up to 5 wt\% plasticizer gave a working time of 3
   min and a setting time of 2 min. The selected medium and light body
   thiol-ene formulations also achieved greater qualitative detail
   reproduction than the commercial material and reproduced micrometer
   patterns with 98\% accuracy.
   Significance. Improving detail reproduction and setting speed is a
   primary focus of dental impression material design and synthesis.
   Radical-mediated polymerizations, particularly thiol-ene reactions, are
   recognized for their speed, reduced shrinkage, and `click' nature. (C)

Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates that electrodes in a bioelectrochemical system
   (BES) can potentially serve as a nonexhaustible electron acceptor for in
   situ bioremediation of hydrocarbon contaminated soil. The deployment of
   BES not only eliminates aeration or supplement of electron acceptors as
   in contemporary bioremediation but also significantly shortens the
   remediation period and produces sustainable electricity. More
   interestingly, the study reveals that microbial metabolism and community
   structure distinctively respond to the bioelectrochemically enhanced
   remediation. Tubular BESs with carbon cloth anode (CCA) or biochar anode
   (BCA) were inserted into raw water saturated soils containing petroleum
   hydrocarbons for enhancing in situ remediation. Results show that total
   petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) removal rate almost doubled in soils close
   to the anode (63.5-78.7\%) than that in the open circuit positive
   controls (37.6-43.4\%) during a period of 64 days. The maximum current
   density from the BESs ranged from 73 to 86 mA/m(2). Comprehensive
   microbial and chemical characterizations and statistical analyses show
   that the residual TPH. has a strongly positive correlation with
   hydrocarbon-degrading microorganisms (HDM) numbers, dehydrogenase
   activity, and lipase activity and a negative correlation with soil pH,
   conductivity, and catalase activity. Distinctive microbial communities
   were identified at the anode, in soil with electrodes, and soil without
   electrodes. Uncommon electrochemically active bacteria capable of
   hydrocarbon degradation such as Comamonas testosteroni, Pseudomonas
   putida, and Ochrobactrum anthropi were selectively enriched on the
   anode, while hydrocarbon oxidizing bacteria were dominant in soil
   samples. Results from genus or phylum level characterizations well agree
   with the data from cluster analysis. Data from this study suggests that
   a unique constitution of microbial communities may play a key role in
   BES enhancement of petroleum hydrocarbons biodegradation in soils.}},

Abstract = {{Trifluoromethane (CHF3, HFC-23) is one of the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)
   regulated under the Kyoto Protocol with a global warming potential
   (GVVP) of 14 800 (100-year). China's past, present, and future HFC-23
   emissions are of considerable interest to researchers and policymakers
   involved in climate change. In this study, we compiled a comprehensive
   historical inventory (1980-2012) and a projection (2013-2050) of HFC-23
   production, abatements, and emissions in China. Results show that HFC-23
   production in China increased from 0.08 +/- 0.05 Gg/yr in 1980 to 15.4
   +/- 2.1 Gg/yr (228 +/- 31 Tg/yr CO2-eq) in 2012, while actual HFC-23
   emissions reached a peak of 10.5 +/- 1.8 Gg/yr (155 +/- 27 Tg/y CO2-eq)
   in 2006, and decreased to a minimum of 7.3 +/- 1.3 Gg/yr (108 +/- 19
   Tg/yr CO2-eq) in 2008 and 2009. Under the examined business-as-usual
   (BAU) scenario, the cumulative emissions of HFC-23 in China over the

Title = {{Forward modeling of GPS multipath for near-surface reflectometry and
   positioning applications}},

Abstract = {{Multipath is detrimental for both GPS positioning and timing
   applications. However, the benefits of GPS multipath for reflectometry
   have become increasingly clear for soil moisture, snow depth, and
   vegetation growth monitoring. Most multipath forward models focus on the
   code modulation, adopting arbitrary values for the reflection power,
   phase, and delay, or they calculate the reflection delay based on a
   given geometry and keep reflection power empirically defined. Here, a
   fully polarimetric forward model is presented, accounting for right- and
   left-handed circularly polarized components of the GPS broadcast signal
   and of the antenna and surface responses as well. Starting from the
   fundamental direct and reflected voltages, we have defined the
   interferometric and error voltages, which are of more interest in
   reflectometry and positioning applications. We examined the effect of
   varying coherence on signal-to-noise ratio, carrier phase, and code
   pseudorange observables. The main features of the forward model are
   subsequently illustrated as they relate to the broadcast signal,
   reflector height, random surface roughness, surface material, antenna
   pattern, and antenna orientation. We demonstrated how the antenna
   orientation-upright, tipped, or upside-down-involves a number of
   trade-offs regarding the neglect of the antenna gain pattern, the
   minimization of CDMA self-interference, and the maximization of the
   number of satellites visible. The forward model was also used to
   understand the multipath signature in GPS positioning applications. For
   example, we have shown how geodetic GPS antennas offer little impediment
   for the intake of near-grazing reflections off natural surfaces, in
   contrast to off metal, because of the lack of diversity with respect to
   the direct signal-small interferometric delay and Doppler, same sense of
   polarization, and similar direction of arrival.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{35}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3596-3606}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The effects of valvular endothelial cell (VlvEC) paracrine signaling on
   VIC phenotype and nodule formation were tested using a co-culture
   platform with physiologically relevant matrix elasticities and diffusion
   distance. 100 gm thin poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels of 3-27 kPa
   Young's moduli were fabricated in transwell inserts. VICs were cultured
   on the gels, as VIC phenotype is known to change significantly within
   this range, while VlvECs lined the underside of the membrane. Co-culture
   with VlvECs significantly reduced VIC activation to the myofibroblast
   phenotype on all gels with the largest percent decrease on the 3 kPa
   gels (70\%), while stiffer gels resulted in approximately 20-30\%
   decrease. Additionally, VlvECs significantly reduced alpha SMA protein
   expression (2 fold lower) on both 3 and 27 kPa gels, as well as the
   number (2 fold lower) of nodules formed on the 27 kPa gels. Effects of
   VlvECs were prevented when nitric oxide (NO) release was inhibited with
   L-NAME, suggesting that VlvEC produced NO inhibits VIC activation.
   Withdrawal of L-NAME after 3, 5, and 7 days with restoration of VlvEC NO
   production for 2 additional days led to a partial reversal of VIC
   activation (25\% decrease). A potential mechanism by which VlvEC
   produced NO reduced VIC activation was studied by inhibiting initial and
   mid-stage cGMP pathway molecules. Inhibition of soluble guanylyl cyclase
   (sGC) with ODQ or protein kinase G (PKG) with RBrcGMP or stimulation of
   Rho kinase (ROCK) with LPA, abolished VlvEC effects on VIC activation.
   This work contributes substantially to the understanding of the valve
   endothelium's role in preventing VIC functions associated with aortic
   valve stenosis initiation and progression. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{100}},
Pages = {{59-67}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cryosols contain roughly 1700 Gt of Soil organic carbon (SOC) roughly
   double the carbon content of the atmosphere. As global temperature rises
   and permafrost thaws, this carbon reservoir becomes vulnerable to
   microbial decomposition, resulting in greenhouse gas emissions that will
   amplify anthropogenic warming. Improving our understanding of carbon
   dynamics in thawing permafrost requires more data on carbon and nitrogen
   content, soil physical and chemical properties and substrate quality in
   cryosols. We analyzed five permafrost cores obtained from the North
   Slope of Alaska during the summer of 2009. The relationship between SOC
   and soil bulk density can be adequately represented by a logarithmic
   function. Gas fluxes at -5 degrees C and -5 degrees C were measured to
   calculate the temperature response quotient (Q(10)). Q(10) and the
   respiration per unit soil C were higher in permafrost-affected soils
   than that in the active layer, suggesting that decomposition and
   heterotrophic respiration in ciyosols may contribute more to global
   warming. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Effect of oxidant exposure on the release of intracellular microcystin,
   MIB, and geosmin from three cyanobacteria species}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{251-259}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The release of intracellular microcystin-LR (MC-LR), 2-methylisobomeol
   (MIB), and geosmin was investigated after the oxidation of three
   cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa (MA), Oscillatoria sp. (OSC), and
   Lyngbya sp. (LYN)). During the oxidation of 200,000 cells/mL of MA,
   release of intracellular MC-LR exceeded the World Health Organization
   (WHO) guideline of 1 mu g/L during the lowest oxidant exposures (CT)
   tested: ozone (0 mg-min/L, below the ozone demand), chlorine (<40
   mg-min/L), chlorine dioxide (<560 mg-min/L), and chloramine (<640
   mg-min/L). As the CT increased, ozone, chlorine, and chlorine dioxide
   were able to oxidize the released MC-LR. During the oxidation of OSC
   (2800 cells/mL) and LYN (1600 cells/mL), release of intracellular MIB
   and geosmin exceeded reported threshold odor values after exposure to
   chlorine, chlorine dioxide, and chloramine, which have low reactivity
   with these taste and odor compounds. Ozone oxidation of OSC yielded an
   increase in MIB concentration at lower exposures (<= 2.9 mg-min/L),
   likely due to insufficient oxidation by hydroxyl radicals. The release
   of intracellular organic matter (IOM) was also measured to determine the
   potential of bulk measurements to act as a surrogate for cyanotoxins and
   metabolite release. In all cases, the dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
   release was less than 0.25 mg(c)/L, which lacked the sensitivity to
   indicate the release of MC-LR, MIB, or geosmin. The fluorescence index
   proved to be a more sensitive indicator of intracellular organic matter
   release than DOC for MA. These results illustrate that toxic or odorous
   compounds may be released from cyanobacteria cells during oxidation
   processes with minimal changes in the DOC concentration. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Conventional sintering of undoped Y2O3 requires temperatures above 1400
   degrees C for a few hours. We show that it can be sintered nearly

   degrees C under a DC applied field of 500 V/cm. At 1000 V/cm sintering
   occurs at 985 degrees C. The FLASH event, when sintering occurs
   abruptly, is preceded by gradually accelerated field-assisted sintering
   (FAST). This hybrid behaviour differs from earlier work on
   yttria-stabilized zirconia where all shrinkage occurred in the flash
   mode. The microstructure of flash-sintered specimens indicated that
   densification was accompanied by rapid grain growth. The single-phase
   nature of flash-sintered Y2O3 was confirmed by high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy. The non-linear rise in conductivity
   accompanying the flash led to Joule heating. It is postulated that
   densification and grain growth were enhanced by accelerated solid-state
   diffusion, resulting from both Joule heating and the generation of
   defects under the applied field. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation from 2-methyl-3buten-2-ol
   (MBO) photooxidation has recently been observed in both field and
   laboratory studies. Similar to the level of isoprene, the level of
   MBO-derived SOA increases with elevated aerosol acidity in the absence
   of nitric oxide; therefore, an epoxide intermediate,
   (3,3-dimethyloxiran-2-yl)methanol (MBO epoxide), was synthesized and
   tentatively proposed to explain this enhancement. In this study, the
   potential of the synthetic MBO epoxide to form SOA via reactive uptake
   was systematically examined. SOA was observed only in the presence of
   acidic aerosol. Major SOA constituents, 2,3-dihydroxyisopentanol and
   MBO-derived organosulfate isomers, were chemically characterized in both
   laboratory-generated SOA and in ambient fine aerosol collected from the
   BEACHON-RoMBAS field campaign during the summer of 2011, where MBO
   emissions are substantial. Our results support the idea that epoxides
   are potential products of MBO photooxidation leading to the formation of
   atmospheric SOA and suggest that reactive uptake of epoxides may explain
   acid enhancement of SOA observed from other biogenic hydrocarbons.}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluated potential impacts of the 2012 High Park wildfire in
   the Poudre River Watershed, Colorado, on source water quality and water
   treatment. The formation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) was
   evaluated by treating water samples with chlorine following uniform
   formation conditions. The efficacy of alum coagulation for reducing
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and DBP concentrations was also
   evaluated. Postwildfire thunderstorms and spring snowmelt increased DOC
   and DBP concentrations relative to base flow conditions. Alum
   coagulation effectively reduced DOC concentrations (by 30-60\% at a dose
   of 50 mg/L) and DBP formation (i.e., total trihalomethanes {[}TTHMs]
   reduced by 60-80\% at a dose of 50 mg/L). The Fort Collins, Colo.,
   drinking water treatment facility responded to the High Park Wildfire by
   increasing environmental monitoring, using multiple water supplies, and
   constructing a presedimentation basin to effectively deliver
   high-quality drinking water to its customers in the year following the

Title = {{A characteristic based volume penalization method for general evolution
   problems applied to compressible viscous flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{262}},
Pages = {{344-357}},

Abstract = {{In order to introduce solid obstacles into flows, several different
   methods are used, including volume penalization methods which prescribe
   appropriate boundary conditions by applying local forcing to the
   constitutive equations. One well known method is Brinkman penalization,
   which models solid obstacles as porous media. While it has been adapted
   for compressible, incompressible, viscous and inviscid flows, it is
   limited in the types of boundary conditions that it imposes, as are most
   volume penalization methods. Typically, approaches are limited to
   Dirichlet boundary conditions. In this paper, Brinkman penalization is
   extended for generalized Neumann and Robin boundary conditions by
   introducing hyperbolic penalization terms with characteristics pointing
   inward on solid obstacles. This Characteristic-Based Volume Penalization
   (CBVP) method is a comprehensive approach to conditions on immersed
   boundaries, providing for homogeneous and inhomogeneous Dirichlet,
   Neumann, and Robin boundary conditions on hyperbolic and parabolic
   equations. This CBVP method can be used to impose boundary conditions
   for both integrated and non-integrated variables in a systematic manner
   that parallels the prescription of exact boundary conditions.
   Furthermore, the method does not depend upon a physical model, as with
   porous media approach for Brinkman penalization, and is therefore
   flexible for various physical regimes and general evolutionary
   equations. Here, the method is applied to scalar diffusion and to direct
   numerical simulation of compressible, viscous flows. With the
   Navier-Stokes equations, both homogeneous and inhomogeneous Neumann
   boundary conditions are demonstrated through external flow around an
   adiabatic and heated cylinder. Theoretical and numerical examination
   shows that the error from penalized Neumann and Robin boundary
   conditions can be rigorously controlled through an a priori penalization
   parameter n. The error on a transient boundary is found to converge as 0
   (n), which is more favorable than the error convergence of the already
   established Dirichlet boundary condition. (C) 2014 The Authors.

   membranes: Effects of anion-exchange on water filtration performance}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{455}},
Pages = {{143-151}},

Abstract = {{The effects of anion exchange on the filtration performance of thin-film
   composite (TFC) membranes with an active layer consisting of a
   nanostructured, lyotropic (i.e., surfactant) liquid crystal (LLC)
   polymer were investigated. These TFC LLC membranes are made by the in
   situ cross-linking of reactive amphiphiles (i.e., surfactants) that
   self-organize in the presence of glycerol into a type I bicontinuous
   cubic (Q(I)) phase that contains a uniform, 3D-interconnected pore
   network lined with tethered cationic moieties and free mobile anions in
   the pores. In this study, a systematic series of experiments were
   performed to independently investigate how monovalent cations and anions
   affect transport in these TFC Q(I) membranes. TFC Q(I) membranes exposed
   to feed solutions that contain different cations (i.e., Li-(+)((aq)),
   Na-(aq)(+), and K-(aq)(+)) but have the same monovalent anion as the
   free mobile anion in the membrane (i.e., Br-(aq)(-)) have a constant
   flux and a high rejection (> 98\%). When the cation is kept constant
   (i.e.. Na-(aq)(+) and the anion in the feed is varied (i.e.,
   Cl-(aq)(-)), Br-(aq)(-), NO3(aq)-, and I-(aq)(-), and allowed to
   partially anionexchange with the membrane, a high rejection is
   maintained ( > 96\%), but the flux significantly changes depending on
   the anion in the feed solution. The flux of the ITC Q(I) membranes can
   also be repeatedly be cycled by contacting the membranes with different
   anions. Control experiments with completely anionexchanged TFC Q(I)
   membranes (i.e., with Cl-(aq)(-), Br-(aq)(-), NO3(aq)-, and I-(aq)(-))
   showed that the rejection of sodium salts and uncharged organic solutes
   was virtually the same for all of the completely anionexchanged
   membranes. As a whole, these results demonstrate that the flux of these
   TFC Q(I) membranes can be tuned by changing the anion with little to no
   change in the rejection performance. The unique performance
   characteristics of TFC Q(I) membranes may offer advantages over
   conventional NF and RO membranes for water purification applications or
   other aqueous separations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{NASA's Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-II (ICESat-2) mission is
   a decadal survey mission (2016 launch). The mission objectives are to
   measure land ice elevation, sea ice freeboard, and changes in these
   variables, as well as to collect measurements over vegetation to
   facilitate canopy height determination. Two innovative components will
   characterize the ICESat-2 lidar: 1) collection of elevation data by a
   multibeam system and 2) application of micropulse lidar
   (photon-counting) technology. A photon-counting altimeter yields clouds
   of discrete points, resulting from returns of individual photons, and
   hence new data analysis techniques are required for elevation
   determination and association of the returned points to reflectors of
   interest. The objective of this paper is to derive an algorithm that
   allows detection of ground under dense canopy and identification of
   ground and canopy levels in simulated ICESat-2 data, based on airborne
   observations with a Sigma Space micropulse lidar. The mathematical
   algorithm uses spatial statistical and discrete mathematical concepts,
   including radial basis functions, density measures, geometrical
   anisotropy, eigenvectors, and geostatistical classification parameters
   and hyperparameters. Validation shows that ground and canopy elevation,
   and hence canopy height, can be expected to be observable with high
   accuracy by ICESat-2 for all expected beam energies considered for
   instrument design (93.01\%-99.57\% correctly selected points for a beam
   with expected return of 0.93 mean signals per shot (msp), and
   72.85\%-98.68\% for 0.48 msp). The algorithm derived here is generally
   applicable for elevation determination from photon-counting lidar
   altimeter data collected over forested areas, land ice, sea ice, and
   land surfaces, as well as for cloud detection.}},

Abstract = {{In the last few years, active learning has been gaining growing interest
   in the remote sensing community in optimizing the process of training
   sample collection for supervised image classification. Current
   strategies formulate the active learning problem in the spectral domain
   only. However, remote sensing images are intrinsically defined both in
   the spectral and spatial domains. In this paper, we explore this fact by
   proposing a new active learning approach for support vector machine
   classification. In particular, we suggest combining spectral and spatial
   information directly in the iterative process of sample selection. For
   this purpose, three criteria are proposed to favor the selection of
   samples distant from the samples already composing the current training
   set. In the first strategy, the Euclidean distances in the spatial
   domain from the training samples are explicitly computed, whereas the
   second one is based on the Parzen window method in the spatial domain.
   Finally, the last criterion involves the concept of spatial entropy.
   Experiments on two very high resolution images show the effectiveness of
   regularization in spatial domain for active learning purposes.}},

Title = {{Feasibility of utilizing numerical viscosity from coarse grid CFD for
   fast turbulence modeling of indoor environments}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a useful tool in building indoor
   environment study. However, the notorious computational effort of CFD is
   a significant drawback that restricts its applications in many areas and
   stages. Factors such as grid resolution and turbulence modeling are the
   main reasons that lead to large computing cost of this method. This
   study investigates the feasibility of utilizing inherent numerical
   viscosity induced by coarse CFD grid, coupled with simplest turbulence
   model, to greatly reduce the computational cost while maintaining
   reasonable modeling accuracy of CFD. Numerical viscosity introduced from
   space discretization in a carefully specified coarse grid resolution may
   have similar magnitude as turbulence viscosity for typical indoor
   airflows. This presents potentials of substituting sophisticated
   turbulence models with inherent numerical viscosity models from coarse
   grid CFD that are often used in fast CFD analysis. Case studies were
   conducted to validate the analytical findings, by comparing the coarse
   grid CFD predictions with the grid-independent CFD solutions as well as
   experimental data obtained from literature. The study shows that a
   uniform coarse grid can be applied, along with a constant turbulence
   viscosity model, to reasonably predict general airflow patterns in
   typical indoor environments. Although such predictions may not be as
   precise as fine-grid CFDs with well validated complex turbulence models,
   the accuracy is acceptable for indoor environment study, especially at
   an early stage of a project. The computing speed is about 100 times
   faster than a fine-grid CFD, which makes it possible to simulate a
   complicated 3-dimensional building in real-time (or near real-time) with
   personal computer.}},

Title = {{Heavy-flavor electron-muon correlations in p plus p and d plus Au
   collisions at root s(NN)=200 GeV}},

Abstract = {{Background: Heavy-flavor modification in relativistic p(d) + A
   collisions are sensitive to different kinds of strong-interaction
   physics ranging from modifications of the nuclear wave function to
   initial- and final-state energy loss. Modifications to single
   heavy-flavor particles and their decay leptons at midrapidity and
   forward rapidity are well established at the Relativistic Heavy Ion
   Collider (RHIC).
   Purpose: This paper presents measurements of azimuthal correlations of
   electron-muon pairs produced from heavy-flavor decays, primarily c (c)
   over bar, in root s(NN) = 200 GeV p + p and d + Au collision using the
   PHENIX detector at RHIC. The electrons are measured at midrapidity while
   the muons in the pair are measured at forward rapidity, defined as the
   direction of the deuteron beam, in order to utilize the deuteron to
   probe low-x partons in the gold nucleus.
   Methods: This analysis uses the central spectrometer arms for electron
   identification and forward spectrometer arms for muon identification.
   Azimuthal correlations are built in all sign combinations for e-mu
   pairs. Subtracting the like-sign yield from the unlike-sign yield
   removes the correlations from light flavor decays and conversions.
   Results: Comparing the p + p results with several different Monte Carlo
   event generators, we find the results are consistent with a total charm
   cross section sigma(c (c) over bar) = 538 +/- 46 (stat) +/- 197 (data
   syst) +/- 174 (model syst) mu b. These generators also indicate that the
   back-to-back peak at Delta phi = pi is dominantly from the leading-order
   contributions (gluon fusion), while higher-order processes (flavor
   excitation and gluon splitting) contribute to the yield at all Delta
   phi. We observe a suppression in the pair yield per collision in d + Au.
   We find the pair yield suppression factor for 2.7 < Delta phi < 3.2 rad
   is J(dA) = 0.433 +/- 0.087 (stat) +/- 0.135 (syst).
   Conclusions: The e-mu pairs result from partons at x(Au) similar to
   10(-2) at Q(2) = 10 GeV/c(2) at the edge of the shadowing region. The
   pair suppression indicates modification to c (c) over bar pairs for
   these kinematics in the cold nuclear medium at RHIC.}},

Abstract = {{We provide the first characterization of diurnal and semidiurnal thermal
   tides in temperature from 30 to 110 km in the winter season (May through
   August) at McMurdo (77.8 degrees S, 166.7 degrees E), Antarctica. The
   observations were made with an Fe Boltzmann temperature lidar in 2011
   and 2012. Over 330 h of winter data are compiled into a composite day of
   temperature perturbations that significantly reduce the incoherent wave
   effects while preserving the coherent tidal signatures. Both diurnal and
   semidiurnal tides have small amplitudes (less than 3 K) below 100 km
   with vertical wavelengths of similar to 29 and similar to 23 km,
   respectively. A new finding of this study is the fast growth of diurnal
   and semidiurnal tidal amplitudes above 100 km to at least 15 K near 110
   km, exceeding that of the freely propagating tides originating from the
   lower atmosphere. Such fast growth exists for all Kp index cases and
   diurnal amplitude increases to 15-30 K at 110 km with larger Kp indices
   corresponding to larger tidal amplitudes and faster growth rates. The
   slopes of diurnal tidal phases become steeper above 100 km, and the
   tidal phases barely change with altitude from 100 to 106 km. The tidal
   growth behavior is reproduced in the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) with
   phases comparable to the observations but magnitudes significantly
   underestimated. WAM compares reasonably well with the observations below
   100 km. The observed significant amplitude increases and phase structure
   changes suggest additional tidal sources near or above 100 km, which
   deserve future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{The high-frequency mobility of positive charges (holes) moving along the
   backbones of an extensive data set of 7 oligomers (n = 2-16) and 6
   polymers (< n > = 26-138) of fluorene was measured using
   pulse-radiolysis time-resolved microwave conductivity (PR-TRMC) in
   benzene. As expected, at 8.9 GHz, the measured isotropic ac mobility,
   mu(iso)(ac,meas), was observed to be strongly dependent on the lengths
   of the chains due to the charges encountering chain ends during one
   microwave cycle. Values of the measured mobility, mu(iso)(ac,meas),
   ranged from 5 X 10(-4) cm(2)/(V s) for an n = 2 repeat unit oligomer to
   0.18 cm(2)/(V s) for a polymer with an average length of < n > = 86
   repeat units. Global fits to the entire set of lengths extracted the
   chain-length-independent intramolecular mobility, mu(intra)(ac), using
   the Kubo formula, assuming normal diffusion along the contour of the
   molecule with reflecting boundary conditions at the ends. The effects of
   chain conformation, chain defects, polymer length distributions, and a
   finite polaron length on mu(iso)(ac,meas) were considered
   quantitatively. The best fit to the whole data set, taking into account
   the polymer length distributions, suggests mu(iso)(ac,meas) = 1.1
   cm(2)/(V s). The fit was improved slightly by implementing randomly
   spaced barriers to transport along the chain with an average spacing of
   similar to 40 repeat units, although at this spacing, the estimate of
   mu(intra)(ac) was not affected. These barriers could represent defects
   in the polymer or dihedral angles between repeat units, giving poor
   electronic coupling that persists for times greater than the 50 Ps
   period of the microwaves. In this defect model, the best fit for their
   average spacing depended strongly on the chain conformation used, while
   the predicted intramolecular mobility did not. This estimate of the
   frequency of defects, a new aspect of this work, is less accurate
   because coiling of chains and defects have similar effects on the
   measured mobilities, and each can mask the effect of the other. The
   present data set also shows that there are few, if any, traps having
   depths substantially greater than thermal energy for holes on
   polyfluorene. The value of 1.1 cm(2)/(V s) is tightly constrained by the
   mobility of charges on the oligomers. Should the diffusion model break
   down for short chains and only be applicable to longer polymers, the
   intrachain mobility may be able to take both larger and smaller values
   (similar to 0.7-3 cm(2)/(V s)), although the data points to this being
   reasonably unlikely. It is shown that measurements of the imaginary part
   of the conductivity could be used in the future to clarify the mobility
   if this is the case.}},

Abstract = {{Crude glycerol is a main byproduct of the biodiesel industry, and the
   beneficial use of waste glycerol has been a major challenge. This study
   characterises the conversion of crude glycerol into bioenergy such as
   H-2 and electricity using a two-stage process linking dark fermentation
   with a microbial fuel cell (MFC) or microbial electrolysis cell (MEC).
   The results showed that fermentation achieved a maximum H-2 rate of 332
   mL/L and a yield of 0.55 mol H-2/mol glycerol, accompanied by 20\% of
   organic removal. Fed with the raw fermentation products with an initial
   COD of 7610 mg/L, a two-chamber MFC produced 92 mW/m(2) in power density
   and removed 50\% of COD. The Columbic efficiency was 14\%. When fed with
   50\% diluted fermentation product, a similar power output (90 mW/m(2))
   and COD removal (49\%) were obtained, but the CE doubled to 27\%.
   Similar substrates were used to produce H-2 in two-chamber MECs, and the
   diluted influent had a higher performance, with the highest yield at 106
   mL H-2/g COD and a CE of 24\%. These results demonstrate that dark
   fermentation linked with MFC/MEC can be a feasible option for conversion
   of waste glycerol into bioenergy.}},

Abstract = {{Global Positioning System (GPS) radio occultation (RO) from low
   Earth-orbiting satellites has increased the quantity of high-vertical
   resolution atmospheric profiles, especially over oceans, and has
   significantly improved global weather forecasting. A new system, the
   Global Navigation Satellite Systems Instrument System for Multistatic
   and Occultation Sensing (GISMOS), has been developed for RO sounding
   from aircraft. GISMOS also provides high-vertical resolution profiles
   that are insensitive to clouds and precipitation, and in addition,
   provides greater control on the sampling location, useful for targeted
   regional studies. The feasibility of the system is demonstrated with a
   flight carried out during development of an Atlantic tropical storm. The
   data have been evaluated through a comparison with dropsonde data. The
   new airborne RO system will effectively increase by more than 50\% the
   number of profiles available for studying the evolution of tropical
   storms during this campaign and could potentially be deployed on
   commercial aircraft in the future.

Abstract = {{In this paper we employ Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics
   Dynamics/Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry
   temperature measurements from 20 to 120 km and between about 72 degrees
   latitude to investigate several aspects of the quasi-two-day wave (QTDW)
   during the 2002-2011 decade, including interannual variability of its
   seasonal-latitudinal structure, its penetration into the lower
   thermosphere, and various wave-wave interactions. We focus on two
   components of the QTDW: the westward-propagating component with zonal
   wave number s=3 (TDW3), and the eastward-propagating component with s=-2
   (TDE2). TDW3(TDE2) has maximum amplitudes during 2003, 2004, and
   2011(2006 and 2011) and both waves have their lowest amplitudes during
   the deep solar minimum years of 2008-2009. TDW3 and to some degree TDE2
   penetrate with significant amplitudes up to 120 km altitude, well into
   the region where neutral winds generate electric fields through the
   dynamo mechanism. A new longitude subdivision method (LSM) is presented
   that enhances temporal resolution of TDW3 and enables the determination
   of 9.6 h and 16 h waves that result from nonlinear interaction between
   TDW3 and/or TDE2 and diurnal migrating (DW1) and semidiurnal migrating
   (SW2) tides. Evidence is presented for westward-propagating 9.6 h and 16
   h waves with s=5 and s=4, respectively, and a zonally symmetric (s=0)
   9.6 h wave. The s=5(s=0) wave only occurs as a result of nonlinear
   interaction between SW2 and TDW3(TDE2), whereas the s=4 wave can result
   from interaction of TDW3 with DW1 or of TDE2 with SW2. We payed special
   attention to possible aliasing between different waves.

Abstract = {{Polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs) measured by the Cloud Imaging and
   Particle Size instrument on the AIM satellite show strong zonal
   asymmetries, with prominent planetary-scale variations. The correlations
   between zonal variations of cloud brightness and temperature or water
   vapor (H2O) are determined in different stages of the PMC season. Aura
   Microwave Limb Sounder measured temperature and water vapor are used in
   the analysis. A zero-dimensional (0-D) PMC model was used to interpret
   the observation. Analyses of all days of the five northern seasons from
   2007 to 2011 indicate that temperature and albedo daily zonal variations
   are anticorrelated in the season start and end, whereas in the core of
   the season the correlation is relatively poor. The albedo and H2O
   correlation in the zonal direction is poor throughout the season.
   Zero-dimensional model physics indicates that when clouds are weaker, or
   the environment is warmer and drier, temperature plays an increasingly
   important role in determining the cloud ice mass variation, which
   explains the stronger correlation of temperature and albedo at the start
   and end of the season. Water vapor takes a strong role in determining
   the ice mass variation in the core of the season when the clouds are
   stronger and the environment is colder and wetter. However, on a daily
   basis the H2O depletion associated with the ice production will lead to
   significant shift of the ice maxima and post-ice H2O maxima in the zonal
   direction, which leads to the poor correlation between the observed H2O
   and albedo.

Abstract = {{Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), are
   genetically linked to host pathways that implicate an underlying role
   for aberrant immune responses to intestinal microbiota. However,
   patterns of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD patients are inconsistent
   among published studies. Using samples from multiple gastrointestinal
   locations collected prior to treatment in new-onset cases, we studied
   the microbiome in the largest pediatric CD cohort to date. An axis
   defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include
   Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and
   Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales,
   Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease
   status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without
   antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the
   microbial dysbiosis associated with CD. Comparing the microbial
   signatures between the ileum, the rectum, and fecal samples indicates
   that at this early stage of disease, assessing the rectal
   mucosal-associated microbiome offers unique potential for convenient and
   early diagnosis of CD.}},

Abstract = {{A novel structure, delta-doped NaYF4:Yb,Er, has been proposed for
   significantly enhancing the fluorescence efficiency of up-conversion
   phosphors. Theoretical calculations indicate that these new delta-doped
   NaYF4:Yb,Er structures will suppress the Yb3+-defect energy transfer
   rate while effectively preserving or enhancing the Yb3+ to Er3+ energy
   transfer. To investigate this effect delta-doped NaYF4:Yb,Er
   nanocrystals have been synthesized according to the designed structure
   model and the prepared samples characterized physically by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution TEM (HRTEM), X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), energy dispersed spectroscopy (EDS) and optically by
   photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Well-defined doping geometries of
   the order of 3-5 nm in width were clearly identified, both spatially and
   chemically. The up-converted emission spectra data were consistent with
   the theoretical predictions.}},

Title = {{Assessing the Impact of Water Filters and Improved Cook Stoves on

   Controlled Trial in Rwanda}},

Abstract = {{Diarrhoea and respiratory infections remain the biggest killers of
   children under 5 years in developing countries. We conducted a 5-month
   household randomised controlled trial among 566 households in rural
   Rwanda to assess uptake, compliance and impact on environmental
   exposures of a combined intervention delivering high-performance water
   filters and improved stoves for free. Compliance was measured monthly by
   self-report and spot-check observations. Semi-continuous 24-h PM2.5
   monitoring of the cooking area was conducted in a random subsample of
   121 households to assess household air pollution, while samples of
   drinking water from all households were collected monthly to assess the
   levels of thermotolerant coliforms. Adoption was generally high, with
   most householders reporting the filters as their primary source of
   drinking water and the intervention stoves as their primary cooking
   stove. However, some householders continued to drink untreated water and
   most continued to cook on traditional stoves. The intervention was
   associated with a 97.5\% reduction in mean faecal indicator bacteria
   (Williams means 0.5 vs. 20.2 TTC/100 mL, p<0.001) and a median reduction
   of 48\% of 24-h PM2.5 concentrations in the cooking area (p = 0.005).
   Further studies to increase compliance should be undertaken to better
   inform large-scale interventions.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a medium volume sampler incorporating quartz fiber
   filters (QFFs) and a polyurethane foam (PUF)/XAD/PUF sandwich (PXP) was
   used to collect 2-methyltetrols (isoprene tracer) and levoglucosan
   (biomass burning tracer) in gaseous and particle (PM2.5) phases. The
   measured gas/particle (G/P) partitioning coefficients (K-p,OM(m)) of
   2-methyltetrols and levoglucosan were calculated and compared to their
   predicted G/P partitioning coefficients (K-p,OM(t)) based on an
   absorptive partitioning theory. The breakthrough experiments showed that
   gas-phase 2-methyltetrols and levoglucosan could be collected using the
   PXP or PUF adsorbent alone, with low breakthrough; however, the
   recoveries of levoglucosan in PXP samples were lower than 70\% (average
   of 51.9-63.3\%). The concentration ratios of 2-methyltetrols and
   levoglucosan in the gas phase to those in the particle phase were often
   close to or higher than unity in summer, indicating that these polar
   species are semi-volatile and their G/P partitioning should be
   considered when applying particle-phase data for source apportionment.
   The K-p,OM(m) values of 2-methyltetrols had small variability in summer
   Denver, which was ascribed to large variations in concentrations of
   particulate organic matter (5.14 +/- 3.29 mu g m(-3)) and small changes
   in ambient temperature (21.8 +/- 4.05 degrees C). The regression between
   log K-p,OM(m) and log K-p,OM(t) suggested that the absorptive G/P
   partitioning theory could reasonably predict the measured G/P
   partitioning of levoglucosan in ambient samples.}},

Abstract = {{Mismatches in power supply and demand due to infrastructure design and
   commercial development result in negative economic impacts and societal
   disruption. These impacts are exacerbated by unusually hot weather as
   well as energy infrastructure failures. Demand reductions by large
   commercial and industrial customers are increasingly sought by
   electrical utilities as a means to control severe supply-demand
   mismatches. Large electricity consumers have used thermal storage
   systems, on-site electricity generation, shifting of production
   processes, and short-term curtailment as means to manage and control
   their demand during peak demand times. Utility notification may be sent
   to request a reduction of load for a given duration when demand reaches
   a specified percent of available supply. This paper examines the
   interconnected nature of the building heating, ventilation, and
   air-conditioning systems as they apply to short-term demand response
   (DR) by conducting a reference case investigation into optimal control
   of building cooling systems for DR.}},

   (EMG) electrodes pairs. Four unique maps were developed to transform the
   EMG control signals in the principal component domain. A preliminary
   validation experiment was performed by 10 nonamputee subjects to
   determine the map with highest performance. The subjects used the
   myoelectric controller to morph a virtual hand between functional grasps
   in a series of randomized trials. The number of joints controlled
   accurately was evaluated to characterize the performance of each map.
   Additional metrics were studied including completion rate, time to
   completion, and path efficiency. The highest performing map controlled
   over 13 out of 15 joints accurately.}},

Abstract = {{The paper presents three-dimensional, large deformation, coupled finite
   element analysis (PEA) of dynamic loading on soft biological tissues
   treated as biphasic (solid-fluid) porous media. An overview is presented
   of the biphasic solid-fluid mixture theory at finite strain, including
   inertia terms. The solid skeleton is modeled as an isotropic,
   compressible, hyperelastic material. FEA simulations include: (1)
   compressive uniaxial strain loading on a column of lung parenchyma with
   either pore air or water fluid, (2) out-of-plane pressure loading on a
   thin slab of lung parenchyma with either pore air or water fluid, and
   (3) pressure loading on a 1/8th symmetry vertebral disc (nucleus and
   annulus) with pore water. For the simulations, mixed formulation Q27P8
   and stabilized Q8P8 finite elements are compared ({''}Q{''} indicates
   the number of solid skeleton displacement nodes, and ``P{''} the number
   of pore fluid pressure nodes). The PEA results demonstrate the interplay
   of dynamics (wave propagation through solid skeleton and pore fluid),
   large deformations, effective stress and pore fluid pressure coupling,
   compressibility and viscosity of pore fluid, and three-dimensional
   effects for soft biological tissues treated as biphasic porous media.}},

Abstract = {{Many colloidal-sized particles encountered in biological and
   membrane-based separation applications can be characterized as soft
   vesicles such as cells, yeast, viruses and surfactant micelles. The
   deformation of these vesicles is expected to critically affect
   permeation by accommodating pore shapes and sizes or enhancing the
   adhesion with a pore surface. Numerical and theoretical modelings will
   be critical to fully understand these processes and thus design novel
   filtration membranes that target, not only size, but deformability as a
   selection criterion. The present paper therefore introduces a multiscale
   strategy that enables the determination of the permeability of a fibrous
   network with respect to complex fluids loaded with vesicles. The
   contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce a particle-based moving
   interface method that can be used to characterized the severe
   deformation of vesicles interacting with an immersed fibrous network.
   Second, we present a homogenization strategy that permits the
   determination of a network permeability, based on the micromechanisms of
   vesicle deformation and permeation. As a proof of concept, we then
   investigate the role of Vesicle-solvent surface tension on the
   permeation of both solvent and vesicle through a simple fiber network.
   We find that vesicles are always retarded relative to the continuum (or
   solvent) flow, and that the relative selectivity for the continuum
   versus the vesicle is inversely proportional to the capillary number.}},

Abstract = {{The overall goal of this work is to develop a numerical simulation which
   correctly describes a bacterial biofilm fluid-structure interaction and
   separation process. In this, the first of a two-part effort, we fully
   develop a convergent scheme and provide numerical evidence for the
   method order as well as a full 3D separation simulation. We use an
   immersed boundary-based method (IBM) to model and simulate a biofilm
   with density and viscosity values different from than that of the
   surrounding fluid. The simulation also includes breakable springs
   connecting the bacteria in the biofilm which allows the inclusion of
   erosion and detachment into the simulation. We use the incompressible
   Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations to describe the motion of the flowing
   fluid and cliscretize the fluid equations using finite differences. We
   use a geometric multigrid method to solve the resulting equations at
   each time step. We note that the use of multigrid is necessary because
   of the dramatically different densities and viscosities between the
   biofilm and the surrounding fluid. We investigate and simulate the model
   in both two and three dimensions.
   We also note that our method differs from several previous attempts of
   using IBM for modeling biofilm/flow interactions in the following ways:
   the density and viscosity of the biofilm can differ substantially from
   the surrounding fluid, and the Lagrangian node locations correspond to
   experimentally measured bacterial cell locations from 3D images taken of
   Staphylococcus epidermidis in a biofilm.
   In the followup article, we will present the results of the validation
   of this model and calibration to several experimental scenarios.}},

   this strategy is motivated by relative orbit control in the
   geostationary regime, in which nonsingular element descriptions are
   especially convenient. The Gauss variational equations for this
   nonsingular set are developed as a basis for the N-impulse feedback
   control strategy, which assumes piecewise constant element errors
   evaluated once per orbit. The N corrective impulses are applied at
   uniform intervals in true anomaly, and the magnitudes thereof are
   determined with a swift numerical method. Two examples demonstrate that
   this method is proficient in helping to detect fuel-optimal burn
   locations for general formation and element difference corrections.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft operational range, the distance an aircraft can travel with a
   fixed quantity of fuel, is an intuitive measure that provides strategic
   and tactical insight to the end user. Currently, there is no rigorously
   defined and derived operational range measure for on-orbit spacecraft
   operations with which to inform strategic decisions and planning. This
   paper illustrates how operational range may be computed in the context
   of orbital motion using optimal control theory and how existing results
   in reachability set computation may be leveraged. The solution method
   presented incidentally solves the free-time minimum-impulse full
   orbit-element transfer problem under J(2) perturbations. The derived
   optimal control policy reproduces known optimal free-time minimum Delta
   nu basis maneuvers. The methodology presented is shown to have the
   capability to exactly capture the minimum-fuel free-time operational
   range volumes, although numerical solution algorithm errors persist. The
   approach is validated using known minimum-fuel optimal maneuvers, and
   numerical examples of on-orbit operational range for low Earth orbits,
   geostationary transfer orbits, and geostationary Earth orbits are given.
   Applications to spacecraft operations are detailed.}},

Abstract = {{The linearized orbit radial dynamics and stability analysis of a
   two-craft virtual Coulomb structure at Earth moon libration points are
   investigated. The linearized study assumes that the sunlit areas of the
   two-craft structure are equal such that the differential solar radiation
   pressure on the formation is zero. The relative distance between the two
   satellites of the Coulomb tether is controlled using electrostatic
   Coulomb forces. The separation distance between the satellites is
   stabilized with a charge feedback law that maintains the relative
   distance at a constant value. The electrostatic virtual tether between
   the two craft is capable of both tensile and compressive forces. The
   gravity gradient torques on the formation due to the two celestial
   objects is exploited to stabilize the Coulomb tether formation in the
   orbit radial direction. Controlling the separation distance stabilizes
   the in-plane rotation angle; however, the out-of-plane rotational motion
   is not affected by the spacecraft charge control law. The new two-craft
   dynamics at the libration points is provided as a general framework in
   which circular Earth orbit dynamics form a special case. Furthermore, an
   alternate linear control technique for a two-craft Coulomb virtual
   tether formation's radial equilibrium at a collinear libration point is
   developed and analyzed. Numerical simulations using charge feedback law
   are presented at both a collinear and a triangular libration point.}},

Title = {{Productivity and Carbon Dioxide Exchange of Leguminous Crops: Estimates

Abstract = {{Net CO2 exchange data of legume crops at 17 flux tower sites in North
   America and three sites in Europe representing 29 site-years of
   measurements were partitioned into gross photosynthesis and ecosystem
   respiration by using the nonrectangular hyperbolic light-response
   function method. The analyses produced net CO2 exchange data and new
   ecosystem-scale ecophysiological parameter estimates for legume crops
   determined at diurnal and weekly time steps. Dynamics and annual totals
   of gross photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, and net ecosystem
   production were calculated by gap filling with multivariate nonlinear
   regression. Comparison with the data from grain crops obtained with the
   same method demonstrated that CO2 exchange rates and ecophysiological
   parameters of legumes were lower than those of maize (Zea mays L.) but
   higher than for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crops. Year-round annual
   legume crops demonstrated a broad range of net ecosystem production,
   from sinks of 760 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1) to sources of -2100 g CO2 m(-2)
   yr(-1), with an average of -330 g CO2 m(-2) yr(-1), indicating overall
   moderate CO2-source activity related to a shorter period of
   photosynthetic uptake and metabolic costs of N-2 fixation. Perennial
   legumes (alfalfa, Medicago sativa L.) were strong sinks for atmospheric
   CO2, with an average net ecosystem production of 980 (range 550-1200) g
   CO2 m(-2) yr(-1).}},

Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{A new approach to shallow depth measurement (<2 m) using polarization
   lidar is presented. The transmitter consists of a 532-nm linearly
   polarized laser coupled with conditioning and polarization optics. The
   prototype lidar evaluates the differing polarization attributes of
   signals scattered from semitransparent media surfaces, simultaneously
   receiving signals polarized in the planes parallel and perpendicular to
   the transmitted laser signal via dual photomultiplier tubes. In the
   event the first surface nearly preserves the incident polarization and
   the second surface depolarizes the incident energy, signals scattered
   from the second surface are isolated from the first by a polarization
   analyzer in the receiver. This approach translates depth measurements
   into the conditions of single surface range measurements, giving the
   ability to resolve extremely shallow depths (e.g., 1 cm) independent of
   laser or detector pulse widths. This approach can circumvent dead time
   issues in photon-counting systems and can be applied to extremely
   shallow and deeper waters for depth determination. Furthermore, the
   approach provides an estimate of the first surface linear depolarization
   ratio, enabling differentiation between surfaces with variable
   scattering properties. Using this technique to acquire range-resolved
   observations through shallow semitransparent media to measure depth
   removes the dependency on sophisticated and, subsequently, costly lidar
   components by becoming independent of system bandwidth. The limiting
   factor in-depth resolution is driven only by the timing resolution of
   the time-to-digital converter. This approach allows for the use of
   common lasers, optics, and detector equipment, making it comparatively
   cheaper and less complex while achieving vast improvement in the
   accuracy and precision of shallow depth measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Accelerometer data from coplanar orbits of Challenging Minisatellite
   Payload (CHAMP) and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE)
   satellites were used to study the complex altitude and latitude
   variations of the thermosphere mass density response to geomagnetic
   activity during 1-10 December 2008 near 09 LT. Helium number densities
   near 500km altitude were extracted from the CHAMP and GRACE measurements
   and clearly show the presence of a winter hemisphere helium bulge. This
   recent extreme solar minimum indicates that wintertime helium
   concentrations exceed NRLMSISE-00 model estimates by 30\%-70\% during
   quiet geomagnetic activity after adjusting F-10.7 input into MSIS. The
   perturbation in mass density from quiet to active conditions is found to
   be less enhanced in the winter hemisphere at the higher GRACE altitudes
   (25\%) than at the lower CHAMP altitudes (60\%) and is attributed to
   dynamic behavior in the helium/oxygen transition. The investigation
   revealed the maximum storm time density perturbation to occur near the
   He/O transition region with a much weaker maximum near the O/N-2
   transition region. The altitude of maximum density perturbation occurs
   where the perturbation in the weighted pressure scale height is equal
   and opposite to the perturbation in the weightedmeanmolecular weight
   scale height. The altitude structure of density scale height
   perturbation is significantly influenced by the changes in the molecular
   weight scale height and can account for 50\% of the change in mass
   density scale height in a region correspondingly close to the He/O
   transition during the 2008 solar minimum period.}},

Abstract = {{The National Center for Atmospheric Research
   Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Electrodynamics General Circulation Model
   (TIE-GCM) is utilized to understand the role that upward propagating
   tides play in determining the zonal mean state of the
   ionosphere-thermosphere system. A sensitivity assessment of the TIE-GCM
   shows that TIE-GCM solutions greatly depend on the lower boundary
   conditions. We also establish the veracity of our TIE-GCM solutions
   within and above the dynamo region. To isolate the mean effects of tidal
   dissipation, differences between TIE-GCM simulations with and without
   lower boundary tidal forcing as specified by the Climatological Tidal
   Model of the Thermosphere are investigated. Dissipation of the DW1,
   (diurnal westward propagating tide with zonal wave number 1), diurnal
   eastward propagating tide with zonal wave number 3, and SW2 (semidiurnal
   tide with zonal wave number 2) explains most of similar to 10-30 m s(-1)
   seasonal and latitudinal variability in zonal winds within the dynamo
   region, with SW2 playing a greater role than ascribed in previous
   studies. Tidal dissipation at low latitudes causes a 9\% decrease (30\%
   increase) in {[}O] ({[}O-2]) number densities near the F-2 layer peak,
   leading to at least a 9\% decrease in peak electron density (NmF2)
   throughout the year. F-2 layer peak height (h(m)F(2)) differences of -4
   to 2 km at low latitudes are explained by variations in the
   field-aligned plasma motion driven by meridional wind differences
   induced by tidal dissipation. Compositional effects are mainly driven by
   DW1 and SW2, which differs from previous interpretations of tidal-driven
   composition changes by DW1 ``tidal mixing{''} exclusively. We suggest
   that tides may produce a net transport of constituents in the
   thermosphere similar to the way that, e.g., gravity waves can drive net
   transport of sodium in the mesosphere.}},

Abstract = {{Ice shelf fractures frequently terminate where they encounter suture
   zones, regions of material heterogeneity that form between meteoric
   inflows in ice shelves. This heterogeneity can consist of marine ice,
   meteoric ice with modified rheological properties, or the presence of
   fractures. Here, we use radar observations on the Larsen C Ice Shelf,
   Antarctica, to investigate (i) the termination of a 25km long rift in
   the Churchill Peninsula suture zone, which was found to contain similar
   to 60m of accreted marine ice, and (ii) the along-flow evolution of a
   suture zone originating at Cole Peninsula. We determine a steady state
   field of basal melting/freezing rates and apply it to a flowline model
   to delineate the along-flow evolution of layers within the ice shelf.
   The thickening surface wedge of locally accumulated meteoric ice, which
   likely has limited lateral variation in its mechanical properties,
   accounts for similar to 60\% of the total ice thickness near the calving
   front. Thus, we infer that the lower similar to 40\% of the ice column
   and the material heterogeneities present there are responsible for
   resisting fracture propagation and thereby delaying tabular calving
   events, as demonstrated in the >40year time series leading up to the
   2004/2005 calving event for Larsen C. This likely represents a highly
   sensitive aspect of ice shelf stability, as changes in the oceanic
   forcing may lead to the loss of this heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Using Optical Properties to Quantify Fringe Mangrove Inputs to the

Journal = {{ESTUARIES AND COASTS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{399-410}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration and dissolved organic
   matter (DOM) optical properties were analyzed along two estuarine river
   transects during the wet and dry seasons to better understand DOM
   dynamics and quantify mangrove inputs. A tidal study was performed to
   assess the impacts of tidal pumping on DOM transport. DOM in the
   estuaries showed non-conservative mixing indicative of mangrove-derived
   inputs. Similarly, fluorescence data suggest that some terrestrial
   humic-like components showed non-conservative behavior. An Everglades
   freshwater-derived fluorescent component, which is associated with soil
   inputs from the Northern Everglades, behaved conservatively. During the
   dry season, a protein-like component behaved conservatively until the
   mid-salinity range when non-conservative behavior due to degradation
   and/or loss was observed. The tidal study data suggests mangrove
   porewater inputs to the rivers following low tide. The differences in
   quantity of DOM exported by the Shark and Harney Rivers imply that
   geomorphology and tidal hydrology may be a dominant factor controlling
   the amount of DOM exported from the mangrove ecotone, where up to 21 \%
   of the DOC is mangrove-derived. Additionally, nutrient concentrations
   and other temporal factors may control DOM export from the mangroves,
   particularly for the microbially derived fluorescent components,
   contributing to the seasonal differences. The wet and dry season fluxes
   of mangrove DOM from the Shark River is estimated as 0.27 x 10(9) mg C
   d(-1) and 0.075 x 10(9) mg C d(-1), respectively, and the Harney River
   is estimated as 1.9 x 10(9) mg C d(-1) and 0.20 x 10(9) mg C d(-1).}},

Title = {{Characterizing transient thermal interactions between lunar regolith and
   surface spacecraft}},
Journal = {{PLANETARY AND SPACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{101-116}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We present a new method, its development, implementation, and
   verification, for calculating the transient thermal interaction between
   lunar regolith and moving spacecraft travelling across the surface of
   the Moon. Regolith temperatures can be determined for lunar landscapes
   as defined by laser altimeter remote sensing data refined with local
   crater and boulder models. The purpose of this approach is to enable
   more detailed, dynamic thermal analyses of mobile systems on the lunar
   surface rather than relying on worst case, boundary condition design
   approaches typically used for spacecraft thermal engineering.
   This new simulation method is based on integrating models that represent
   small and large scale landscapes; reproduce regolith and boulder
   temperatures on the Moon; define the position of the Sun; and perform
   ray tracing to determine infrared and solar heat fluxes between passing
   objects and the surface. The thermal model of the lunar regolith
   enhances established models with a slope- and depth-dependent density.
   The simulation results were verified against remote sensing data
   obtained from the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment of the Lunar
   Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and from other sources cited in the
   literature.
   The verification results for isolated regolith surface patches showed a
   deviation from established models of about +/- 3-6 K (+/- 1-6\%) during
   lunar day, and lunar night. For real landscapes such as Crater Calippus
   and Crater Marius A, the deviation is less than +/- 15 K (+/- 10\%)
   compared to remote sensing data for the majority of measured data
   points. Only in regions with presumed different regolith material
   properties, such as steep slopes or depressions, or in regions with a
   low resolution on the topographic map, were the deviations up to 100 K
   (60\%). From the results, empirical equations were derived, which can be
   used for worst case calculations or to calculate initial temperatures
   for more elaborate time marching numerical models.
   The proposed new method could be further enhanced to address scientific
   questions by incorporating more detailed regolith and boulder models, or
   be used as-is to evaluate the dynamic thermal envelope of moving
   spacecraft. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Genome-wide association studies, DNA sequencing studies, and other
   genomic studies are finding an increasing number of genetic variants
   associated with clinical phenotypes that may be useful in developing
   diagnostic, preventive, and treatment strategies for individual
   patients. However, few variants have been integrated into routine
   clinical practice. The reasons for this are several, but two of the most
   significant are limited evidence about the clinical implications of the
   variants and a lack of a comprehensive knowledge base that captures
   genetic variants, their phenotypic associations, and other pertinent
   phenotypic information that is openly accessible to clinical groups
   attempting to interpret sequencing data. As the field of medicine begins
   to incorporate genome-scale analysis into clinical care, approaches need
   to be developed for collecting and characterizing data on the clinical
   implications of variants, developing consensus on their actionability,
   and making this information available for clinical use. The National
   Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the Wellcome Trust thus
   convened a workshop to consider the processes and resources needed to:
   (1) identify clinically valid genetic variants; (2) decide whether they
   are actionable and what the action should be; and (3) provide this
   information for clinical use. This commentary outlines the key
   discussion points and recommendations from the workshop. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Optical properties of aerosols over Hanle (4500 m amsl) in the western
   Himalayas were studied using skyradiometer observations during October
   2007 to December 2010. Yearly mean value of aerosol optical depth (ADD)
   at 500 nm is 0.042 +/- 0.002, which demonstrates the pristine
   environment of the station. Seasonal mean AODs at 500 nm during summer,
   autumn, winter, and spring are 0.044 +/- 0.002, 0.031 +/- 0.001, 0.031
   +/- 0.001, and 0.061 +/- 0.002, respectively. The relatively high AOD
   during spring, associated with an elevated aerosol layer observed from
   space, supports the hypothesis of middle-upper tropospheric heating
   during pre-monsoon period. Seasonal mean values of Angstrom exponent
   (alpha) estimated from linear regression method varied from minimum 0.65
   (spring) to maximum 1.02 (autumn). Dominance of coarse mode aerosols at
   the site is thus evident during spring. Analysis of AOD profiles
   obtained from satellite data and airmass back trajectories superimposed
   with fire-counts data indicated the presence of desert-dust at the
   altitudes of 5 to 7 km amsl during the episodes of high AOD and low
   alpha. These trajectories indicated airmasses mostly coming from
   different desert regions, e.g in north-west Asia and Iran in the Middle
   east. Further, arrival of airmasses from the densely populated and
   industrialized Punjab and Haryana regions from the north-west of India
   apparently explains the relative contribution of transported
   anthropogenic aerosols over the station. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{439}},

Abstract = {{The size distribution of small asteroids in the Main Belt is assumed to
   be determined by an equilibrium between the creation of new bodies out
   of the impact debris of larger asteroids and the destruction of small
   asteroids by collisions with smaller projectiles. However, for a
   diameter less than 6 km, we find that YORP-induced rotational disruption
   significantly contributes to the erosion even exceeding the effects of
   collisional fragmentation. Including this additional grinding mechanism
   in a collision evolution model for the asteroid belt, we generate
   size-frequency distributions from either an accretional or an `Asteroids
   were born big' initial size-frequency distribution that are consistent
   with observations reported in Gladman et al. Rotational disruption is a
   new mechanism that must be included in all future collisional evolution
   models of asteroids.}},

Abstract = {{Three sets of devices were simulated, designed, and laid out for
   fabrication in the EuroPractice shuttle program and then measured
   in-house after fabrication. A combination of analytical and numerical
   modeling is used to extract the dispersion curves that define the
   effective index of refraction as a function of wavelength for three
   different classes of silicon photonic devices, namely, micro-ring
   resonators, racetrack resonators, and directional couplers. The results
   of this phenomenological study are made plausible by the linearity of
   the extracted dispersion curves with wavelength over the wavelength
   regime of interest ( S and C bands) and the use of the determined
   effective indices to reconstruct the measured transmission as a function
   of wavelength curves in close agreement with experiment. The extracted
   effective indices can be used to place limits on the actual fabricated
   values of waveguide widths, thicknesses, radii of curvature, and
   coupling gaps. (c) 2014 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates modeling of the interaction of human tissues
   with a probe antenna situated on the surface of the skin. The goal is to
   differentiate temperature changes at different depths under the skin for
   passive radiometric measurements of internal body temperature. An
   improved metric is defined in order to differentiate thermal power
   radiated from a specific part of the tissue relative to the total
   thermal power received by the probe antenna. The frequency range between
   0.5 and 3 GHz is investigated due to the sensing depth that can be
   achieved for a given receiver sensitivity. The general approach is to
   validate full-wave finite element method (FEM) EM simulations with a
   spectral-domain analysis for layered lossy dielectrics with a dipole at
   the interface between two of the layers. This was successfully done for
   a dipole on a water half-space and a stack of three tissues (skin, fat,
   and muscle). A new type of multifrequency probe was designed for 1.4,
   2.7, and 4.9 GHz operation, and the predicted impedance validated
   experimentally. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that
   the near-field received power of a dipole probe placed in contact with
   lossy layered media is examined as a function of frequency. This is
   shown to be significantly different than the plane wave case, and is
   necessary knowledge for the design of a portable radiometer for
   microwave internal body thermometry.}},

Abstract = {{In part III of a three-part study on North American climate in phase 5
   of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) models, the authors
   examine projections of twenty-first-century climate in the
   representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) emission experiments.
   This paper summarizes and synthesizes results from several coordinated
   studies by the authors. Aspects of North American climate change that
   are examined include changes in continental-scale temperature and the
   hydrologic cycle, extremes events, and storm tracks, as well as regional
   manifestations of these climate variables. The authors also examine
   changes in the eastern North Pacific and North Atlantic tropical cyclone
   activity and North American intraseasonal to decadal variability,
   including changes in teleconnections to other regions of the globe.
   Projected changes are generally consistent with those previously
   published for CMIP3, although CMIP5 model projections differ importantly
   from those of CMIP3 in some aspects, including CMIP5 model agreement on
   increased central California precipitation. The paper also highlights
   uncertainties and limitations based on current results as priorities for
   further research. Although many projected changes in North American
   climate are consistent across CMIP5 models, substantial intermodel
   disagreement exists in other aspects. Areas of disagreement include
   projections of changes in snow water equivalent on a regional basis,
   summer Arctic sea ice extent, the magnitude and sign of regional
   precipitation changes, extreme heat events across the northern United
   States, and Atlantic and east Pacific tropical cyclone activity.}},

Title = {{Growth of multiparticle aggregates in sedimenting suspensions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{742}},
Pages = {{577-617}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The process of multiparticle aggregation in a dilute sedimenting
   suspension is rigorously simulated, with precise hydrodynamical
   interactions. The primary particles are monodisperse non-Brownian
   spheres at zero Reynolds number, with short-range molecular attractions.
   The rigid aggregates grow, as they settle downwards, by sequential
   particle addition - a valid assumption for dilute suspensions during the
   initial stages. The growth starts from doublet-particle interaction, but
   the indeterminate initial doublet concentration does not affect the
   results for cluster geometry and settling velocity. A new particle is
   generated far below a cluster with uniform probability density, and many
   trial particle-cluster relative trajectories are computed with high
   accuracy until a collision is found. The new cluster is then assumed to
   be rigid and allowed to reach a steady sedimentation regime (which is a
   spiral motion around the axis of steady rotation, ASR) before another
   particle is added, and so on. The ASR is typically far away from the
   cluster centre of mass. The Stokes flow solution algorithm for
   particle-cluster interaction works very efficiently with high-order
   multipoles (to order 100) and is extended to arbitrarily small
   particle-cluster separations by a geometry perturbation adapted from the
   conductivity simulations of Zinchenko (Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A,
   1998, vol. 356, pp. 2953-2998). Clusters are generated to N = 100
   spheres, with extensive averaging over many growth realizations. The
   fractal scaling similar to N-0.48 for the cluster settling speed is
   quickly attained once N >= 25, and the exponent 0.48 is practically
   independent of the strength of molecular forces. The cluster fractal
   dimension is predicted to be d(f) = 1.91 +/- 0.02 (in contrast to the
   existing views that sequential addition can only produce high-d(f)
   clusters). Several average characteristics of the cluster size are also
   computed. The theoretical settling speed has no adjustable parameters
   and agrees reasonably well with prior experiments for a moderately
   polydisperse system in a broad range of cluster sizes.}},

Title = {{Impact of Risk on Design-Build Selection for Highway Design and
   Construction Projects}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{153-162}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{The design-build (DB) project delivery method continues to grow as a
   viable alternative delivery method for highway projects. The primary
   reason for selecting DB delivery is to take advantage of the time
   savings inherent in the process. However, because of low levels of
   design at the time of contract awards, DB contracts often carry more
   risks and uncertainties than other contracts, which makes the decision
   to select DB delivery complex. Applying risk analysis strategies and
   tools to the delivery selection process will help decision makers
   evaluate and select the DB delivery method consistently and defensibly.
   This paper examines 39 generic risk factors related to the DB delivery
   selection process. These risks were identified through previous research
   and risk analysis workshops on transportation projects worth more than
   \$10billion. To explore how these risks impact DB delivery selection, a
   questionnaire was developed to collect data from a national cross
   section of professionals with an average of 25years of experience
   related to risk and project delivery methods in the transportation
   industry. An exploratory factor analysis was used to investigate the
   relationship between DB delivery selection and the 39 generic risk
   factors. The results indicate that seven delivery selection risk factors
   have the most influence on DB delivery selection: (1)scope risk;
   (2)third-party and complexity risk; (3)construction risk; (4)utility and
   right-of-way (ROW) risk; (5)level of design and contract risk;
   (6)management risk; and (7)regulation and railroad risk. This study
   compares risk preferences of public owners and design-builders for
   choosing DB delivery. Understanding these risk factors will help
   professionals not only select DB for appropriate projects but also
   allocate risks more properly in DB contracts.}},

   environment}},
Journal = {{BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{73}},
Pages = {{239-248}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{An experimental flow visualization study was conducted to assess the
   ability of synthetic jets to control airflows and particulates in an
   indoor environment. Flow visualization was used to determine whether
   paired synthetic jet modules installed adjacent to a supply diffuser
   could significantly impact room air distribution by changing the angle
   at which the supply air left the diffuser and mixed into the room.
   Controlling the supply jet angle can affect how the supply air mixes
   with the room air and potentially impact the air quality of the room. A
   laboratory room with 7 air changes per hour (ACH) was selected to
   perform the present study. This lab space is representative of
   occupational indoor environments requiring ventilation strategies beyond
   typical systems to ensure the safe and efficient operation of the space.
   In this study, four synthetic-jet modules were tested, including two
   pairs of small 0.5 mm by 27.5 mm rectangular jets driven by one-inch
   diameter actuators used in a previous small-scale ventilation study and
   two larger 0.5 mm by 55 mm rectangular jets driven by two-inch diameter
   actuators constructed specifically for this study. Statistical methods
   were used to compare the visualized supply flow controlled with active
   synthetic jets versus a baseline case (with no flow control). A
   significant increase in the angle of mixing of the supply air of up to
   40 or 50\% of the original supply jet angle was achieved. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The reactions between polysilazane and hafnium-butoxide precursors are

   Hf-N bonds in the liquid state, and Hf-O-Si bonds in the cross-linked

   N, and O in proportion of the Hf/Si ratio in the compounds. The average
   values of such bonds formed by Hf, relative to silicon, are 11.2, 17.8,
   and 24.4\%, which is in reasonable agreement with the overall Hf/Si
   ratio in the samples (8\%, 15\% and 22\%). It is concluded that it is

Volume = {{16}},

Abstract = {{Electrical circuit analogies are often used to design microfluidic
   systems because they simplify device design, providing simple
   relationships between fluid flow rate, driving forces, and channel
   dimensions. However, such approximations often significantly
   overestimate flow rates in situations where start-up energy losses from
   establishing kinetic head are similar in magnitude to the energy
   required to overcome viscous shear stresses, as is often the case within
   complex microfluidic networks. These reduced flows can be more
   accurately predicted within an electrical analogy framework that
   accounts for the nonlinear flow resistance generated on the transient
   regime of start-up flow. In this work, standard flow resistance
   expressions are modified to account for such effects, and the onset of
   nonlinear resistance is predicted by a dimensionless parameter, which is
   dependent on the Reynolds number and the channel length. As a
   demonstration, variable fluid resistance is shown to dramatically affect
   the flow performance of common microfluidic units such as T-junctions
   and serpentine channels, and the change in performance is accurately
   predicted. Experimental and theoretical analysis of T-junctions further
   shows that variable flow resistance causes the ratio of flows through
   the junction to converge toward unity with respect to an increasing
   total flow rate. In addition, serpentine channels are shown to
   exaggerate these start-up effects, owing to compounded energetic demand
   associated with changing a flow's direction. As a result, serpentine
   channels cause the ratio of flow rates exiting a T-junction to diverge
   from unity with respect to an increasing flow rate.}},

Abstract = {{Severe hypoxemia refractory to pulmonary mechanical ventilation remains
   life-threatening in critically ill patients. Peritoneal ventilation has
   long been desired for extrapulmonary oxygenation owing to easy access of
   the peritoneal cavity for catheterization and the relative safety
   compared to an extracorporeal circuit. Unfortunately, prior attempts
   involving direct oxygen ventilation or aqueous perfusates of
   fluorocarbons or hemoglobin carriers have failed, leading many
   researchers to abandon the method. We attribute these prior failures to
   limited mass transfer of oxygen to the peritoneum and have designed an
   oxygen formulation that overcomes this limitation. Using
   phospholipid-coated oxygen microbubbles (OMBs), we demonstrate 100\%
   survival for rats experiencing acute lung trauma to at least 2 h. In
   contrast, all untreated rats and rats treated with peritoneal oxygenated
   saline died within 30 min. For rats treated with OMBs, hemoglobin
   saturation and heart rate were at normal levels over the 2-h timeframe.
   Peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs was therefore shown to be safe and
   effective, and the method requires less equipment and technical
   expertise than initiating and maintaining an extracorporeal circuit.
   Further translation of peritoneal oxygenation with OMBs may provide
   therapy for acute respiratory distress syndrome arising from trauma,
   sepsis, pneumonia, aspiration, burns and other pulmonary diseases. (C)

Abstract = {{We consider sets of natural vectorial orbital elements of the
   Milankovitch type for perturbed Keplerian motion. These elements are
   closely related to the two vectorial first integrals of the unperturbed
   two-body problem; namely, the angular momentum vector and the
   Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector. After a detailed historical discussion of the
   origin and development of such elements, nonsingular equations for the
   time variations of these sets of elements under perturbations are
   established, both in Lagrangian and Gaussian form. After averaging, a
   compact, elegant, and symmetrical form of secular Milankovitch-like
   equations is obtained, which reminds of the structure of canonical
   systems of equations in Hamiltonian mechanics. As an application of this
   vectorial formulation, we analyze the motion of an object orbiting about
   a planet (idealized as a point mass moving in a heliocentric elliptical
   orbit) and subject to solar radiation pressure acceleration (obeying an
   inverse-square law). We show that the corresponding secular problem is
   integrable and we give an explicit closed-form solution.}},

Title = {{A mathematical model of the coupled mechanisms of cell adhesion,
   contraction and spreading}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that cell spreading is highly dependent on the
   contractility of its cytoskeleton and the mechanical properties of the
   environment it is located in. The dynamics of such process is critical
   for the development of tissue engineering strategy but is also a key
   player in wound contraction, tissue maintenance and angiogenesis. To
   better understand the underlying physics of such phenomena, the paper
   describes a mathematical formulation of cell spreading and contraction
   that couples the processes of stress fiber formation, protrusion growth
   through actin polymerization at the cell edge and dynamics of
   cross-membrane protein (integrins) enabling cell-substrate attachment.
   The evolving cell's cytoskeleton is modeled as a mixture of fluid,
   proteins and filaments that can exchange mass and generate contraction.
   In particular, besides self-assembling into stress fibers, actin
   monomers able to polymerize into an actin meshwork at the cell's
   boundary in order to push the membrane forward and generate protrusion.
   These processes are possible via the development of cell-substrate
   attachment complexes that arise from the mechano-sensitive equilibrium
   of membrane proteins, known as integrins. After deriving the governing
   equation driving the dynamics of cell evolution and spreading, we
   introduce a numerical solution based on the extended finite element
   method, combined with a level set formulation. Numerical simulations
   show that the proposed model is able to capture the dependency of cell
   spreading and contraction on substrate stiffness and chemistry. The very
   good agreement between model predictions and experimental observations
   suggests that mechanics plays a strong role into the coupled mechanisms
   of contraction, adhesion and spreading of adherent cells.}},

Abstract = {{Filtration to remove viruses is one of the single most expensive steps
   in the production of mAb drug products. Therefore, virus filtration
   steps should be fully optimized, and any decline in flow rates warrants
   investigation into the causes of such membrane fouling. In the current
   study, it was found that freezing and thawing of a mAb bulk drug
   solution caused a substantial decrease in viral filter membrane flow
   rate. Freezing and thawing also caused formation of aggregates and
   particles across a broad size range, including particles that could be
   detected by microflow imaging (1 m in size). However, removal of these
   particles offered little protection against flow rate decline during
   viral filtration. Further investigation revealed that trace amounts of
   aggregates (ca. 10(-6) of the total mass of protein in solution)
   approximately 20-40 nm in size were primarily responsible for the
   observed membrane fouling. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal dispersions in liquid crystals can serve as a soft-matter
   toolkit for the self-assembly of composite materials with pre-engineered
   properties and structures that are highly dependent on particle-induced
   topological defects(1-3). Here, we demonstrate that bulk and surface
   defects in nematic fluids can be patterned by tuning the topology of
   colloidal particles dispersed in them. In particular, by taking
   advantage of two-photon photopolymerization techniques to make
   knot-shaped microparticles, we show that the interplay of the topologies
   of the knotted particles, the nematic field and the induced defects
   leads to knotted, linked and other topologically non-trivial field
   configurations(4-12). These structures match theoretical predictions
   made on the basis of the minimization of the elastic free energy and
   satisfy topological constraints(4,5). Our approach may find uses in
   self-assembled topological superstructures of knotted particles linked
   by nematic fields, in topological scaffolds supporting the decoration of
   defect networks with nanoparticles(1), and in modelling other physical
   systems exhibiting topologically analogous phenomena(12-16).}},

Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{Light detection and ranging (LIDAR) systems are able to measure the
   speed of incoming wind before it reaches a wind turbine rotor. These
   preview wind measurements can be used in feedforward control systems
   designed to reduce turbine structural loads. However, the degree to
   which such preview-based control techniques can reduce loads by reacting
   to turbulence depends on how accurately the incoming wind field can be
   measured. This study examines the accuracy of different measurement
   scenarios that rely on coherent continuous-wave or pulsed Doppler LIDAR
   systems, in terms of root-mean-square measurement error, to determine
   their applicability to feedforward control. In particular, the impacts
   of measurement range, angular offset of the LIDAR beam from the wind
   direction, and measurement noise are studied for various wind
   conditions. A realistic simulation case involving a scanning LIDAR unit
   mounted in the spinner of a MW-scale wind turbine is studied in depth,
   with emphasis on preview distances that provide minimum measurement
   error for a specific scan radius. Measurement error is analyzed for
   LIDAR-based estimates of point wind speeds at the rotor as well as
   spanwise averaged blade effective wind speeds. The impact of turbulence
   structures with high coherent turbulent kinetic energy on measurement
   error is discussed as well. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{In order to reduce the debris population in LEO, remediation is
   necessary. An active debris removal method is explored that utilizes
   fuel reserves on a recently launched upper stage to rendezvous with, and

   discretized tether model attached to six degree of freedom end bodies.
   The thrust output is shaped to remove the spectral energy at the natural
   frequencies of the tether, significantly reducing the post-burn relative
   motion between the vehicles. The sensitivity of the input shaping
   performance due to imperfect knowledge of the debris mass demonstrates
   that a double notch spanning multiple frequencies around the first mode
   is necessary to be robust to unknown debris mass. On-orbit simulations
   show that input shaping helps the tethered system achieve smooth
   oscillations about a gravity gradient alignment, reducing collision
   likelihood. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Game theory is emerging as a popular tool for distributed control of
   multiagent systems. To take advantage of these game theoretic tools, the
   interactions of the autonomous agents must be designed within a
   game-theoretic environment. A central component of this game-theoretic
   design is the assignment of a local utility function to each agent. One
   promising approach to utility design is assigning each agent a utility
   function according to the agent's Shapley value. This method frequently
   results in games that possess many desirable features, such as the
   existence of pure Nash equilibria with near-optimal efficiency. In this
   paper, we explore the relationship between the Shapley value utility
   design and the resulting efficiency of both pure Nash equilibria and
   coarse correlated equilibria. To study this relationship, we introduce a
   simple class of resource allocation problems. Within this class, we
   derive an explicit relationship between the structure of the resource
   allocation problem and the efficiency of the resulting equilibria.
   Lastly, we derive a bicriteria bound for this class of resource
   allocation problems-a bound on the value of the optimal allocation
   relative to the value of an equilibrium allocation with additional
   agents.}},

Abstract = {{The standard hospital room interface for control of communication and
   entertainment devices assumes a patient has the ability to hold and
   press mechanical switches. If the patient does not have these abilities,
   then the patient must wait for a nurse to walk by the room to ask for
   help. Mobile devices using the Android and iOS operating systems are
   compared to accommodate the limitations of a patient for communication
   and control of the hospital room environment. In order to design an
   appropriate system, analysis of currently available off-the-shelf
   technology is performed to find the appropriate configuration that is
   compatible with the hospital room environment and covers a clear patient
   need. Evaluation of components for a fully integrated system is shown.
   Strengths and weaknesses of each technology are discussed. Progress
   toward an integrated solution on a tablet is provided in the conclusion.}},

Title = {{Identifying the factors that influence the reactivity of effluent
   organic matter with hydroxyl radicals}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{408-419}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are an effective treatment
   technology for the removal of a variety of organic pollutants in both
   water and wastewater treatment. However, many background constituents in
   water are highly reactive towards hydroxyl radicals (HO center dot) and
   decrease the efficiency of the process towards contaminant oxidation. Up
   to 95\% of the HO center dot scavenging can come from dissolved organic
   matter (OM). In this study, 28 wastewater effluent samples were analyzed
   to find correlations between the reactivity of HO center dot with
   wastewater-derived OM (known as effluent organic matter, EfOM), water
   quality parameters, treatment train characteristics, and
   fluorescence-derived data. Rate constants for the reaction between HO
   center dot and EfOM (k(EfOM-HO)) were measured using a bench scale
   UV-based AOP system with methylene blue as an HO center dot probe and
   confirmed using an electron pulse radiolysis method for a subset of the
   samples. The EfOM was characterized using a series of physicochemical
   parameters, including polarity, average molecular size and fluorescence.
   The kinetic data were analyzed with principal component analysis and
   Akaike Information Criterion. Four predictors were identified as
   dominant: chemical oxygen demand, retention onto NH2 extraction medium,
   fluorescence index, and total organic carbon. These four variables
   accounted for approximately 62\% of the variability in the value of
   k(EfOM-HO) The average k(EfOM-HO) value for EfOM in this study was 2.5 x
   10(8) M-C(-1) s(-1), which is about 31\% lower than the 3.6 x 10(8)
   M-C(-1) s(-1) value determined for natural organic matter isolates and
   commonly used in AOP modeling. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Seismic performance evaluation of arch dams under different
   environmental conditions is vital for the structural safety of the
   existing dams. In the present paper, effects of the reservoir water in
   four different levels are investigated on the seismic performance of an
   arch dam. Dynamic equilibrium equations of the dam-reservoir-massless
   foundation coupled system are solved by Newmark's time integration
   algorithm. Several three-component ground motions, obtained from
   deterministic hazard analysis of the dam site, are used for excitation
   of the finite element model. Seismic performance evaluation is utilized
   considering parameters such as crest displacement, demand capacity
   ratio, cumulative inelastic duration and extension of the overstressed
   areas on upstream and downstream faces obtained from linear elastic
   analyses. It is found that dewatering the reservoir leads to extension
   of the overstressed areas on both upstream and downstream faces and
   increases structural operating risk. In such a case, detailed nonlinear
   analyses, including joint and material nonlinearities, are required for
   more realistic results on crack propagation.}},

Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{A comparison of different methods to estimate the sundirection vector
   using a partially underdetermined set of cosinetype coarse sun sensors
   (CSS), while simultaneously controlling the attitude towards a
   powerpositive orientation, is presented. CSS are commonly used in
   performing powerpositive sunpointing and are attractive due to their
   relative inexpensiveness, small size, and reduced power consumption. For
   this study only CSS and rate gyro measurements are available, and the
   sensor configuration does not provide global triple coverage required
   for a unique sundirection calculation. The methods investigated include
   a vector average method, a combination of least squares and minimum norm
   criteria, and an extended Kalman filter approach. All cases are
   formulated such that precise ground calibration of the CSS is not
   required. Despite significant biases in the state dynamics and
   measurement models, Monte Carlo simulations show that an extended Kalman
   filter approach, despite the underdetermined sensor coverage, can
   provide degree level accuracy of the sundirection vector both with and
   without a control algorithm running simultaneously. If no rate gyro
   measurements are available, and rates are partially estimated from CSS,
   the EKF performance degrades as expected, but is still able to achieve
   better than 10 degrees accuracy using only CSS measurements.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {{219-230}},

Abstract = {{Experiments with silicon-oxycarbide, an anode material for Li-ion
   batteries, are compared with a rigorous solution for time-dependent
   diffusion profiles in spherical particles, which is supplemented by
   finite element analyses of cuboid shaped particles. In this way a value
   for the chemical diffusivity D = 1.8 x 10(-18) -4.2 x 10(-18) m(2) s(-1)
   across the entire range of the state-of-charge is obtained. The method
   consists of galvanostatic titrations, where a constant current injection
   is followed by the measurement of the galvanic potential in open circuit
   relaxation, at various values of the state-of-charge. Comparison with
   theory shows that the relaxation time varies with the state-of-charge
   because the particles have variable size: small particles have short
   relaxations and dominate the low values of the state-of-charge. The
   theoretical results have additional notable features. We show that the
   solution for the spherical particles can be represented to a very good
   approximation by a single time constant of exponential relaxation. Its
   value is significantly slower than the results for one-dimensional
   solutions. The relaxation time is independent of the injection current
   and the state-of-charge, imparting significant generality to the
   results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   in thermally annealed a-Si:H}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{The influence of stress in thin films appears to be a widespread issue
   when such films are thermally annealed to facilitate crystallite
   nucleation and growth. It is therefore of interest to examine on a
   fundamental level how stress influences crystallite nucleation and
   growth in a thermally annealed thin film system that has been
   extensively studied and well characterized. This article reports
   crystallite nucleation rates, growth rates and activation energies for
   nucleation and growth in different spatial regions of a thermally
   annealed a-Si: H film. The rates far from a cleaved film edge are
   representative of a film region that is under high tensile stress, while
   rates near a cleaved film edge are representative of a film region that
   has undergone stress relief. The existence of or reduction in film
   stress is supported by mu-Raman measurements. It is shown that film
   stress increases the film nucleation rate and decreases the crystallite
   growth rate, resulting in significantly smaller crystallite sizes in the
   fully crystallized stressed film areas compared to those observed in the
   stress relieved areas. By combining the activation energy data for
   nucleation and growth, it is shown how film stress affects two
   fundamental structural parameters that control crystallization, the
   height of the amorphous-crystalline energy barrier and the critical
   crystallite size. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne observations from the California Research at the Nexus of Air
   Quality and Climate Change (CalNex) campaign in May and June 2010 are
   used to investigate the role of ammonia (NH3) in fine particulate matter
   (PM2.5) formation and surface air quality in California and test the key
   processes relevant to inorganic aerosol formation in the GEOS-Chem
   model. Concentrations of ammonia throughout California, sulfur dioxide
   (SO2) in the Central Valley, and ammonium nitrate in the Los Angeles
   (LA) area are underestimated several-fold in the model. We find that
   model concentrations are relatively insensitive to uncertainties in
   gas-particle partitioning and deposition processes in the region.
   Conversely, increases to anthropogenic livestock ammonia emissions (by a
   factor of 5) and anthropogenic sulfur dioxide emissions in the Central
   Valley (by a factor of 3-10) and a reduction of anthropogenic NOx
   emissions (by 30\%) substantially reduce the bias in the simulation of
   gases (SO2, NH3, HNO3) throughout California and PM2.5 near LA, although
   the exact magnitudes of emissions in the region remain uncertain. Using
   these modified emissions, we investigate year-round PM2.5 air quality in
   California. The model reproduces the wintertime maximum in surface
   ammonium nitrate concentrations in the Central Valley (regional mean
   concentrations are three times higher in December than in June),

Abstract = {{Here, we report the structural and mechanical properties of several
   two-dimensional (2-D) materials by using first-principles density
   functional theory calculations. We find that the buckled single-layer
   silicene could transit to planar hexagonal silicene at a critical
   tensile strain of 0.20. Phonon dispersion analysis suggests that the
   planar hexagonal silicene under tension is stable. The Poisson's ratio
   of silicene and MoS2 shows strong anisotropy: it increases while
   stretched in the zigzag direction, but decreases when strained in the
   armchair direction. When stretched in the zigzag direction, the
   Poisson's ratio of silicene could reach 0.62. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{This review describes the use of ultrasonic reflectometry (UR) for
   characterizing membranes and membrane processes. A growing body of
   literature documents the capabilities of UR as a versatile
   nondestructive, noninvasive, real-time, and low-cost methodology that
   can provide important information about a wide range of membrane-based
   separations. A compact but thorough explanation of the ultrasonic
   measurement concepts relevant for use of the methodology for membrane
   applications is first presented. This section is followed by a
   description of the many studies in which UR has been employed for
   characterization of membrane structure, formation, compaction, and
   inorganic and organic membrane fouling, the latter in both real-time and
   post-mortem modes. Examples of recent work that incorporates the
   innovative use of UR for scaling in nanofiltration and reverse osmosis
   applications as well as results that suggest the potential of the
   ultrasonic slow wave to monitor pore closure in early-stage fouling are
   then highlighted. UR is then compared with other techniques for fouling
   detection so that the advantages and limitations of UR can be placed in
   proper perspective. Finally, valuable future directions for the
   incorporation of UR in membrane research, development, and practice are
   considered.}},

Abstract = {{We present measurements on resonant photodetectors utilizing sub-bandgap
   absorption in polycrystalline silicon ring resonators, in which light is
   localized in the intrinsic region of a p + /p/i/n/n+ diode. The devices,
   operating both at lambda = 1280 and lambda = 1550 nm and fabricated in a
   complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) dynamic random-access
   memory emulation process, exhibit detection quantum efficiencies around
   20\% and few-gigahertz response bandwidths. We observe this performance
   at low reverse biases in the range of a few volts and in devices with
   dark currents below 50 pA at 10 V. These results demonstrate that such
   photodetector behavior, previously reported by Preston et al. {[}Opt.
   Lett. 36, 52 (2011)], is achievable in bulk CMOS processes, with
   significant improvements with respect to the previous work in quantum
   efficiency, dark current, linearity, bandwidth, and operating bias due
   to additional midlevel doping implants and different material
   deposition. The present work thus offers a robust realization of a fully
   CMOS-fabricated all-silicon photodetector functional across a wide

Abstract = {{Thin film composite (TFC) membranes are critical components for reverse
   osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) processes. Similar to other
   liquid-based filtration membranes, TFC membranes are susceptible to
   concentration polarization and fouling/scaling. Recently, surface
   topography modification has been shown as a potential approach for
   fouling mitigation. However, for TFC membranes, tailoring the surface
   topography remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate for the first time,
   successful fabrication of a patterned TFC membrane. A two-step
   fabrication process was carried out by (1) nanoimprinting a
   polyethersullone (PES) support, and (2) forming a thin dense film atop
   the FES support via interfacial polymerization (IF) with trimesoyl
   chloride and 1,3-phenylenediamine solutions. Chemical, topographic, and
   permeation characterization was performed on the imprinted lP membranes,
   and their permselectivity was compared with that of a flat
   (non-imprinted) TFC membrane prepared using he same lP procedure. (C)

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Despite the recent progress in physical control and manipulation of
   various condensed matter, atomic, and particle systems, including
   individual atoms and photons, our ability to control topological defects
   remains limited. Recently, controlled generation, spatial translation,
   and stretching of topological point and line defects have been achieved
   using laser tweezers and liquid crystals as model defect-hosting
   systems. However, many modes of manipulation remain hindered by
   limitations inherent to optical trapping. To overcome some of these
   limitations, we integrate holographic optical tweezers with a magnetic
   manipulation system, which enables fully holonomic manipulation of
   defects by means of optically and magnetically controllable colloids
   used as ``handles{''} to transfer forces and torques to various liquid
   crystal defects. These colloidal handles are magnetically rotated around
   determined axes and are optically translated along three-dimensional
   pathways while mechanically attached to defects, which, combined with
   inducing spatially localized nematic-isotropic phase transitions, allow
   for geometrically unrestricted control of defects, including previously
   unrealized modes of noncontact manipulation, such as the twisting of
   disclination clusters. These manipulation capabilities may allow for
   probing topological constraints and the nature of defects in
   unprecedented ways, providing the foundation for a tabletop laboratory
   to expand our understanding of the role defects play in fields ranging
   from subatomic particle physics to early-universe cosmology.}},

   carbon (DOC) and microbial biomass carbon (HWC) in deep permafrost
   (280-350 cm) have been utilized during soil forming processes, with an
   increase of delta C-13(DOC) and delta C-13(HWC) values about 3 parts per

Title = {{Sex differences in mechanical allodynia: how can it be preclinically
   quantified and analyzed?}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Translating promising preclinical drug discoveries to successful
   clinical trials remains a significant hurdle in pain research. Although
   animal models have significantly contributed to understanding chronic
   pain pathophysiology, the majority of research has focused on male
   rodents using testing procedures that produce sex difference data that
   do not align well with comparable clinical experiences. Additionally,
   the use of animal pain models presents ongoing ethical challenges
   demanding continuing refinement of preclinical methods. To this end,
   this study sought to test a quantitative allodynia assessment technique
   and associated statistical analysis in a modified graded nerve injury
   pain model with the aim to further examine sex differences in allodynia.
   Graded allodynia was established in male and female Sprague Dawley rats
   by altering the number of sutures placed around the sciatic nerve and
   quantified by the von Frey test. Linear mixed effects modeling regressed
   response on each fixed effect (sex, oestrus cycle, pain treatment). On
   comparison with other common von Frey assessment techniques, utilizing
   lower threshold filaments than those ordinarily tested, at 1 s
   intervals, appropriately and success fully investigated female
   mechanical allodynia, revealing significant sex and oestrus cycle
   difference across the graded allodynia that other common behavioral
   methods were unable to detect. Utilizing this different von Frey
   approach and graded allodynia model, a single suture inflicting less
   allodynia was sufficient to demonstrate exaggerated female mechanical
   allodynia throughout the phases of dioestrus and pro- oestrus. Refining
   the von Frey testing method, statistical analysis technique and the use
   of a graded model of chronic pain, allowed for examination of the
   influences on female mechanical nociception that other von Frey methods
   cannot provide.}},

Title = {{A two-fold increase of carbon cycle sensitivity to tropical temperature
   variations}},
Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{506}},
Number = {{7487}},
Pages = {{212+}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Earth system models project that the tropical land carbon sink will
   decrease in size in response to an increase in warming and drought
   during this century, probably causing a positive climate feedback(1,2).
   But available data(3-5) are too limited at present to test the predicted
   changes in the tropical carbon balance in response to climate change.
   Long-term atmospheric carbon dioxide data provide a global record that
   integrates the interannual variability of the global carbon balance.
   Multiple lines of evidence(6-8) demonstrate that most of this
   variability originates in the terrestrial biosphere. In particular, the
   year-to-year variations in the atmospheric carbon dioxide growth rate
   (CGR) are thought to be the result of fluctuations in the carbon fluxes
   of tropical land areas(6,9,10). Recently, the response of CGR to
   tropical climate interannual variability was used to put a constraint on
   the sensitivity of tropical land carbon to climate change(10). Here we
   use the long-term CGR record from Mauna Loa and the South Pole to show
   that the sensitivity of CGR to tropical temperature interannual
   variability has increased by a factor of 1.9 +/- 0.3 in the past five
   decades. We find that this sensitivity was greater when tropical land
   regions experienced drier conditions. This suggests that the sensitivity
   of CGR to interannual temperature variations is regulated by moisture
   conditions, even though the direct correlation between CGR and tropical
   precipitation is weak(9). We also find that present terrestrial carbon
   cycle models do not capture the observed enhancement in CGR sensitivity
   in the past five decades. More realistic model predictions of future
   carbon cycle and climate feedbacks require a better understanding of the
   processes driving the response of tropical ecosystems to drought and
   warming.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of systematically designed controllable reversible
   addition fragmentation termination (CRAFT) compounds, we have identified
   structure property relationships related to the RAFT compositional
   structure as it impacts photoplasticity in covalent adaptable networks
   (CANs). In this study, we have expanded the range and functional
   capabilities of addition fragmentation capable network forming monomers
   by synthesizing and evaluating systematically varying CRAFT monomers
   with the general formula ABCBA. Subsequent assessment of the impact of
   these monomers on photoplasticity and stress relaxation was performed.
   Structural variation of the A and B segments, in particular, imparts
   increased efficiency and efficacy in stress relaxation and
   photoplasticity. The CRAFT monomers employed have highly efficient
   stress relaxation properties demonstrating stress reduction of up to
   54\% and 75\%, respectively, in postpolymerization network
   photoplasticity experiments. Furthermore, polymerization stress
   reduction in purely acrylate and acrylate thiol networks with CRAFT
   monomers shows a remarkably enhanced efficacy with the inclusion of
   relatively small amounts of the monomers. With a loading of only 1.5 wt
   \% of the alkene trithiocarbonate monomer in each system more than 75\%
   stress reduction was achieved.}},

Abstract = {{A linear stability analysis of the Navier-Stokes (NS) granular
   hydrodynamic equations is performed to determine the critical length
   scale for the onset of vortices and clusters instabilities in granular
   dense binary mixtures. In contrast to previous attempts, our results
   (which are based on the solution to the inelastic Enskog equation to NS
   order) are not restricted to nearly elastic systems since they take into
   account the complete nonlinear dependence of the NS transport
   coefficients on the coefficients of restitution alpha(ij). The
   theoretical predictions for the critical length scales are compared to
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in flows of strong dissipation
   (alpha(ij) >= 0.7) and moderate solid volume fractions (phi <= 0.2). We
   find excellent agreement between MD and kinetic theory for the onset of
   velocity vortices, indicating the applicability of NS hydrodynamics to
   polydisperse flows even for strong inelasticity, finite density, and

Abstract = {{Understanding which surface properties control adsorption on metal
   surfaces has long been a primary goal in surface science and catalysis,
   for both fundamental and technological reasons. Moreover, for the
   purposes of designing catalysts for enhanced selectivity, it can be
   desirable to understand surface properties that lead to significant
   differences in adsorption energies of hydrocarbons and oxygenates. In
   this work, expressions for predicting adsorption energies of CH3 and OH
   are developed, based in part on screening a large number of possible
   predictors. These expressions include the d-band center, d-band filling,
   and matrix coupling element, which are well-known in the literature, as
   well as the relatively unstudied p-band center. These expressions are
   also applied to other adsorbates, including alkyls, alkoxides, C, O, and
   H, allowing elucidation of how the adsorbate structure affects the
   adsorption energy. While all alkyls behave similarly and all alkoxides
   behave similarly, there are significant differences between alkyls and
   alkoxides. In particular, adsorbate surface coupling is net attractive
   for hydrocarbons but net repulsive for oxygenates, likely due to the
   deeper valence states on O atoms. As demonstrated within the context of
   the partial oxidation of ethylene, this difference can potentially be
   used to rapidly screen catalysts for improved selectivity based on the
   values of simple electronic structure parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Silicone oil used as a lubricant in prefilled syringes has the potential
   to induce formation of particles in protein formulations. In the current
   study, we used a therapeutic fusion protein, albinterferon alpha(2b), to
   evaluate protein aggregation and particle formation in the presence of
   silicone oil microdroplets or immobilized silicone interfaces. Tertiary
   structure of albinterferon alpha(2b) adsorbed on silicone oil
   microdroplets was perturbed in a formulation containing only buffer. In
   contrast, native-like tertiary structure was retained for albinterferon
   alpha(2b) adsorbed on silicone oil microdroplets in 300 mM sodium
   chloride or 300 mM sucrose formulations. Agitation of albinterferon
   alpha(2b) samples in the presence of silicone oil droplets or
   siliconized beads, respectively, caused albinterferon alpha(2b)
   aggregation and subvisible particle formation in formulations containing
   buffer or 300 mM sucrose. Adsorption of albinterferon alpha(2b) onto
   silicone oil was inhibited by addition of 0.01\% (w/v) polysorbate 80,
   and this excipient prevented aggregation during agitation in the
   presence of silicone oil microdroplets. Aggregation was also reduced in
   the presence of 300 mM sodium chloride during agitation at least in part
   because of the increased conformational stability of the protein. (C)

Abstract = {{Wave interferometry is a remote sensing technique, which is increasingly
   employed in helioseismology, seismology, and acoustics to retrieve
   parameters of the propagation medium from two-point cross-correlation
   functions of random wavefields. Here we apply interferometry to yearlong
   records of seafloor pressure at 28 locations off New Zealand's South
   Island to investigate propagation and directivity properties of
   infragravity waves away from shore. A compressed cross-correlation
   function technique is proposed to make the interferometry of dispersive
   waves more robust, decrease the necessary noise averaging time, and
   simplify retrieval of quantitative information from noise cross
   correlations. The emergence of deterministic wave arrivals from cross
   correlations of random wavefields is observed up to the maximum range of
   692 km between the pressure sensors in the array. Free, linear waves
   with a strongly anisotropic distribution of power flux density are found
   to be dominant in the infragravity wavefield. Lowest-frequency
   components of the infragravity wavefield are largely isotropic. The
   anisotropy has its maximum in the middle of the spectral band and
   decreases at the high-frequency end of the spectrum. Highest anisotropy
   peaks correspond to waves coming from portions of the New Zealand's
   shoreline. Significant contributions are also observed from waves
   propagating along the coastline and probably coming from powerful
   sources in the northeast Pacific. Infragravity wave directivity is
   markedly different to the east and to the west of the South Island. The
   northwest coast of the South Island is found to be a net source of the
   infragravity wave energy.}},

Abstract = {{The project development process aims to deliver the most appropriate
   roadway project given its context. Past work has shown that significant
   gains are realized when construction expertise is integrated early and
   throughout the project-delivery process. The Kentucky Transportation
   Cabinet has initiated a process that reviews design documents prior to
   construction to address issues that may result in time delays and cost
   increases. However, these efforts are not utilizing a systematic review
   process that would allow detailed documentation of the issues identified
   and provide a lessons-learned database for future use. The study
   undertaken classifies the constructability issues that typically impact
   highway construction projects. This paper first identifies the common
   constructability categories through a national review and then
   quantifies the frequency and severity of constructability issues by
   comment type and category, review year, reviewer, and comment severity.
   The paper's primary contribution to the body of knowledge is the
   determination that constructability issues are dynamic and change over
   time, there is a need for consistency among reviewers, and that team
   reviews are more appropriate than a single-reviewer approach. (C) 2013

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{During in situ remediation of contaminated groundwater, a treatment
   solution is often injected into the contaminated region to initiate
   reactions that degrade the contaminant. Degradation reactions only occur
   where the treatment solution and the contaminated groundwater are close
   enough that mixing will bring them together. Degradation is enhanced
   when the treatment solution is spread into the contaminated region,
   thereby increasing the spatial extent of mixing and degradation
   reactions. Spreading results from local velocity variations that emerge
   from aquifer heterogeneity and from spatial variations in the external
   forcings that drive flow. Certain patterns in external forcings have
   been shown to create chaotic advection, which is known to enhance
   spreading of solutes in groundwater flow and other laminar flows. This
   work uses numerical simulations of flow and reactive transport to
   investigate how aquifer heterogeneity changes the qualitative and
   quantitative aspects of chaotic advection in an aquifer, and the extent
   to which these changes enhance contaminant degradation. We generate
   chaotic advection using engineered injection and extraction (EIE), an
   approach that uses sequential injection and extraction of water in wells
   surrounding the contaminated region to create time-dependent flow fields
   that promote plume spreading. We demonstrate that as the degree of
   heterogeneity increases, both plume spreading and contaminant
   degradation increase; however, the increase in contaminant degradation
   is small relative to the increase in plume spreading. Our results show
   that the combined effects of EIE and heterogeneity produce substantially
   more stretching than either effect separately.

Abstract = {{In an open surgery, identification of precise margins for curative
   tissue resection is performed bymanual palpation. This is not the case
   for minimally invasive and robotic procedures, where tactile feedback is
   either distorted or not available. In this paper, we introduce the
   concept of intraoperative wireless tissue palpation. The wireless
   palpation probe (WPP) is a cylindrical device (15 mm in diameter, 60 mm
   in length) that can be deployed through a trocar incision and directly
   controlled by the surgeon to create a volumetric stiffness distribution
   map of the region of interest. This map can then be used to guide the
   tissue resection to minimize healthy tissue loss. The wireless operation
   prevents the need for a dedicated port and reduces the chance of
   instrument clashing in the operating field. The WPP is able to measure
   in real time the indentation pressure with a sensitivity of 34 Pa, the
   indentation depth with an accuracy of 0.68 mm, and the probe position
   with a maximum error of 11.3 mm in a tridimensional workspace. The WPP
   was assessed on the benchtop in detecting the local stiffness of two
   different silicone tissue simulators (elastic modulus ranging from 45 to
   220 kPa), showing a maximum relative error below 5\%. Then, in vivo
   trials were aimed to identify an agar-gel lump injected into a porcine
   liver and to assess the device usability within the frame of a
   laparoscopic procedure. The stiffness map created intraoperatively by
   the WPP was compared with a map generated ex vivo by a standard uniaxial
   material tester, showing less than 8\% local stiffness error at the site
   of the lump.}},

Abstract = {{Even though the measures to minimize the stack effect in high-rise
   buildings were taken that include a revolving door on the lobby floor,
   additional barriers to the passage of air in the lower part of the
   building, and air-tightness reinforcement for elevator doors, the stack
   effect is still present during cold season in Korea. However, it is
   difficult to fully apply the measures for stack effect under occupied
   condition in high-rise buildings. In this study, as an advanced method
   to lower the stack effect in high-rise buildings under occupied
   condition, mechanical ventilation in elevator shaft space, which cools
   the shaft space with outdoor air and reduces the temperature or pressure
   differences between indoor air in shaft and outdoor air, was proposed.
   In this paper, the application details and performance analyses of the
   installed shaft cooling system in a completed building in Korea were
   described. Also, as a measure to improve the performance of the applied
   system, concentrated cooling in the lower part of the elevator shaft
   where there is a main air flow passage was proposed. As a result,
   cooling effect of mechanical ventilation system in elevator shaft was
   improved and the extent of stack effect in winter was decreased
   effectively.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper reports about a real-time hybrid simulation (RTHS) of a
   nonductile reinforced concrete frame that had previously been tested on
   a shake table (ST) at the University of California, Berkeley. This
   three-story, three-bay frame is numerically modeled with
   flexibility-based/layered nonlinear elements and over 400 degrees of
   freedom (DOFs), while one of the nonductile base columns is physically
   tested in the laboratory. RTHS is enabled through a new code developed
   by the authors, and these simulation results are compared with those
   obtained from the ST test. The comparison between ST tests and RTHS is
   encouraging, though still not acceptable (within 10\%). Details of the
   simulation are provided, and preliminary results indicate that RTHS may
   be indeed provide the natural path for a gradual substitution of
   physical (and expensive) testing by numerical simulation. This
   contribution offers a small step in that direction.}},

Title = {{Assessment of infiltration heat recovery and its impact on energy
   consumption for residential buildings}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{316-323}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Infiltration is a major contributor to the energy consumption of
   buildings, particularly in homes where it accounts for one-third of the
   heating and cooling loads. Traditionally, infiltration is calculated
   independent of the building envelope performance, however, it has been
   established that a thermal coupling exists between the infiltration and
   conduction heat transfer of the building envelope. This effect is known
   as infiltration heat recovery (IHR). Experiments have shown that
   infiltration heat recovery can typically reduce the infiltration thermal
   load by 10-20\%.
   Currently, whole-building energy simulation tools do not account for the
   effect of infiltration heat recovery on heating and cooling loads. In
   this paper, five steady-state IHR models are described to account for
   the thermal interaction between infiltration air and building envelope
   components. In particular, inter-model and experimental comparisons are
   carried out to assess the prediction accuracy of five IHR models. In
   addition, the results from a series of sensitivity analyses are
   presented, including an evaluation of the predictions for heating energy
   use associated with four audited homes obtained from whole-building
   energy simulation analysis with implemented infiltration heat recovery
   models.
   Experimental comparison of the IHR models reveal that the predictions
   from all the five models are consistent and are within 2\% when 1-D flow
   and heat transfer conditions are considered. When implementing IHR
   models to a whole-building simulation environment, a reduction of 5-30\%
   in heating consumption is found for four audited residential homes. (C)

Abstract = {{To establish a sustainable society, it is necessary to understand the
   flows and stocks of materials. However, traditional material flow
   analysis requires large quantities of data relating to the consumption
   and trade of materials in the past and the lifetime distributions of end
   use. To overcome the problem that such data may not be available, we
   have proposed using nighttime light images to estimate the in-use stocks
   of materials in countries for which the data are unavailable. In the
   previous study, in-use steel stock for civil engineering and building in
   2006 was estimated using nighttime light images. However, several
   aspects of the methodology must be improved, and time-series analyses
   using nighttime light images have not yet been performed. Therefore, in
   this study, we improved the estimation of in-use steel stock by using
   new geological information (i.e., LandScan population distribution data)
   and correcting the pixel area. We prepared radiance-calibrated nighttime
   light data for 2006 and 2010 and conducted time-series analyses of the
   in-use steel stock using the nighttime light data. The in-use steel
   stock for civil engineering and building in 2010 was found to amount to
   approximately 11.3 Gt, which was approximately 21\% higher than that in
   2006. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Title = {{Modeling residential developed land in rural areas: A size-restricted
   approach using parcel data}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOGRAPHY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{33-45}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In most land cover datasets, the classification of developed land is
   less accurate in rural areas than in urban areas, due to difficulties in
   identifying rural developed areas from remote sensing data. This
   inconsistency makes land cover data less reliable in rural settings,
   when employed for small area population estimation or for exploring
   processes such as urbanization. This research addresses this challenge,
   identifying rural developed land using ancillary variables such as
   terrain, road density and distance to roads. Predictive models are
   developed using residential parcel units as a spatial outcome variable.
   Although parcels are often the most spatially precise indicators of
   developed land, rural parcels can be very large, leading to high levels
   of heterogeneity within a parcel. To assess the effect of size on the
   relationships between the ancillary variables and the locations of rural
   residential land, parcels are categorized on size and size-restricted
   statistical models are run. Goodness-of-fit measures and the predictive
   power of the model improve with decreasing parcel size. A thorough model
   evaluation quantifies prediction accuracy and highlights rural
   residential areas with the highest probability of development. A
   subsequent validation using building footprints as indicators of actual
   development provides strong evidence that a size-restricted modeling
   approach improves the predictive power of the statistical model. This
   type of modeling framework thus has the potential to improve the
   accuracy of rural developed land classifications in land cover databases
   such as the U.S. National Land Cover Database (NLCD). (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We study the synchronization of a coupled pair of one-dimensional
   Kuramoto-Sivashinsky systems, with equations augmented by a
   third-space-derivative term. With two different values of a system
   parameter, the two systems synchronize in the generalized sense. The
   phenomenon persists even in the extreme case when one of the equations
   is missing the extra term. Master-slave synchronization error is small,
   so the generalized synchronization relationship is useful for predicting
   the state of the master from that of the slave, or conversely, for
   controlling the slave. The spatial density of coupling points required
   to bring about generalized synchronization appears to be related to the
   wavelength of traveling wave solutions, and more generally to the width
   of coherent structures in the separate systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Who gets to use radio spectrum, and when, where, and how? Scheduling
   (who, where, when) and system configuration (how) are fundamental
   problems in radio communication and wireless networking. Optimization
   decomposition based on Lagrangian relaxation of signal quality
   requirements provides a mathematical framework for solving this type of
   combined problem. This paper demonstrates the technique as a solution to
   spatial reuse time-division multiple access (STDMA) scheduling with
   reconfigurable antennas. The joint beam steering and scheduling (JBSS)
   problem offers both a challenging mathematical structure and significant
   practical value. We present algorithms for JBSS and describe an
   implemented system based on these algorithms. We achieve up to 600\% of
   the throughput of TDMA with a mean of 234\% in our experiments. The
   decomposition approach leads to a working distributed protocol producing
   optimal solutions in an amount of time that is at worst linear in the
   size of the input. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first
   actually implemented wireless scheduling system based on dual
   decomposition. We identify and briefly address some of the challenges
   that arise in taking such a system from theory to reality.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of wastewater contaminant transport in surface waters using
   verified Lagrangian sampling}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{470}},
Pages = {{551-558}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Contaminants released from wastewater treatment plants can persist in
   surface waters for substantial distances. Much research has gone into
   evaluating the fate and transport of these contaminants, but this work
   has often assumed constant flow from wastewater treatment plants.
   However, effluent discharge commonly varies widely over a 24-hour
   period, and this variation controls contaminant loading and can
   profoundly influence interpretations of environmental data. We show that
   methodologies relying on the normalization of downstream data to
   conservative elements can give spurious results, and should not be used
   unless it can be verified that the same parcel of water was sampled.
   Lagrangian sampling, which in theory samples the same water parcel as it
   moves downstream (the Lagrangian parcel), links hydrologic and chemical
   transformation processes so that the in-stream fate of wastewater
   contaminants can be quantitatively evaluated. However, precise
   Lagrangian sampling is difficult, and small deviations - such as missing
   the Lagrangian parcel by less than 1 h - can cause large differences in
   measured concentrations of all dissolved compounds at downstream sites,
   leading to erroneous conclusions regarding in-stream processes
   controlling the fate and transport of wastewater contaminants.
   Therefore, we have developed a method termed ``verified Lagrangian{''}
   sampling, which can be used to determine if the Lagrangian parcel was
   actually sampled, and if it was not, a means for correcting the data to
   reflect the concentrations which would have been obtained had the
   Lagrangian parcel been sampled. To apply the method, it is necessary to
   have concentration data for a number of conservative constituents from
   the upstream, effluent, and downstream sites, along with upstream and
   effluent concentrations that are constant over the short-term (typically
   2-4 h). These corrections can subsequently be applied to all data,
   including non-conservative constituents. Finally, we show how data from
   other studies can be corrected. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a fetal complication of
   pregnancy epidemiologically linked to cardiovascular disease in the
   newborn later in life. However, the mechanism is poorly understood with
   very little research on the vascular structure and function during
   development in healthy and IUGR neonates. Previously, we found vascular
   remodeling and increased stiffness in the carotid and umbilical
   arteries, but here we examine the remodeling and biomechanics in the
   larger vessels more proximal to the heart. To study this question,
   thoracic and abdominal aortas were collected from a sheep model of
   placental insufficiency IUGR (PI-IUGR) due to exposure to elevated
   ambient temperatures. Aortas from control (n = 12) and PI-IUGR fetuses
   (n = 10) were analyzed for functional biomechanics and structural
   remodeling. PI-IUGR aortas had a significant increase in stiffness (P <
   0.05), increased collagen content (P < 0.05), and decreased sulfated
   glycosaminoglycan content (P < 0.05). Our derived constitutive model
   from experimental data related increased stiffness to reorganization
   changes of increased alignment angle of collagen fibers and increased
   elastin (P < 0.05) in the thoracic aorta and increased concentration of
   collagen fibers in the abdominal aorta toward the circumferential
   direction verified through use of histological techniques. This fetal
   vascular remodeling in PI-IUGR may set the stage for possible altered
   growth and development and help to explain the pathophysiology of adult
   cardiovascular disease in previously IUGR individuals.}},

Title = {{Evaluating temperature and duration in arterial tissue fusion to
   maximize bond strength}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{41-49}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Tissue fusion is a growing area of medical research that enables
   mechanical closure of tissues without the need of foreign bodies such as
   sutures or staples. Utilizing heat and pressure applied for a specified
   time, a bond can be formed between adjacent tissues. The success or
   failure of tissue fusion is contingent upon the strength of the bond it
   creates between opposing tissues, yet little characterization has been
   done to measure the strength of this interface as a function of the
   input parameters, such as heat and pressure. Previous studies have
   examined the strength of tissue fusion using clinically relevant
   outcomes such as bursting pressure or tearing strength, but none have
   explored metrics more appropriate for determining the mechanics of the
   actual bond such as peel or shear strengths. The goal of this study is
   to establish methodology for T-peel and lap shear testing of fused
   tissues and measure the fusion bonding strength as a function of
   temperature and time using the ConMed Altrus (R) laparoscopic thermal
   fusion device. Across five temperatures (120, 140, 150, 160, 170 degrees
   C) and four time durations (500, 1000, 1800, 3000 ms) the mean peeling
   strength, ultimate shear strength, and bursting pressure of fused
   porcine splenic arteries were measured. The shear strength increased
   with increasing temperature and time with an ultimate shear strength at
   160 degrees C and 3000 ms equal to 290 +/- 99 Pa. No trend was observed
   between the input parameters of time and applied temperature and the
   mean peeling force, although there were significant differences between
   groups. The bursting pressure increased significantly with increasing
   durations, but no trend was noted between temperature and bursting
   pressure. The shear strength data suggest there is some physical or
   chemical reaction which occurs in the tissue between 120 degrees C and
   150 degrees C which provides a stronger bond. The shear and peel results
   also reveal that the fusion bond undergoes brittle failure. This study
   suggests that the tissue fusion bond is maximized at temperatures over
   150 degrees C and at a time of 3000 ms using the ConMed Altru (R) and
   that input parameters can be tuned to optimize the strength of the
   bonded region. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   polar elastic dielectric thermo-electro-mechanical system are analyzed
   under the coupling influence of hyperelastic, polarization,
   electrostriction and thermal contribution on the system. The typical
   thermodynamics cycles of the polar elastic dielectric are described as
   cooling devices and generators and the electrocaloric and pyroelectric
   energy conversion are calculated. Ferroelectric polymer, as an important
   category of electroactive polymers, is a typical polar dielectric with a
   large ECE and a large deformation. As an example, when subjected to
   different voltage, the ferroelectric polymers are regarded as cooling
   devices. We calculated their temperature change, entropy change, heat
   absorptions and work generation. We also calculated the voltage change,
   electric quantity change and work of the ferroelectric polymer which is
   regarded as generators when subjected to different temperatures.
   Finally, we investigated the thermoelectro-mechanical coupling behavior
   of the ferroelectric polymers undergoing ferroelectric-paraelectric
   phase transition. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the
   physicochemical properties of five dissolved organic matter (DOM)
   isolates on their reactivity with the hydroxyl radical (HO center dot)
   in water.
   Five DOM isolates were purchased from the International Humic Substance
   Society (IHSS). Weight average molecular weight (M (W)) of these samples
   was quantified using size exclusion chromatography based on polyethylene
   glycols as reference standards. Functional group and elemental
   composition of the DOM samples were available from the IHSS website.
   Room temperature rate constants were measured using electron pulse
   radiolysis.
   Five IHSS standards were examined in this study: two soil organic and
   three aquatic organic matters. The composition varied from samples that
   had primarily aliphatic carbon (Pony Lake fulvic acid) to mostly
   aromatic carbon moieties (Elliot Soil humic acid). The M (W) values of
   the five samples ranged from 2,400 to 4,100 Da, with an average value of
   3,060 Da. Second-order reaction rate constants between DOM and HO center
   dot (k (DOM-HO center dot)) were measured using thiocyanate competition
   kinetics, giving values ranging from 1.21 to 10.36 x 10(8) M-C (-1)
   s(-1). The k (DOM-HO center dot) values were not found to correlate with
   either M (W) or the aliphatic-aromatic carbon ratio, which is consistent
   with previous reports looking at natural organic matter (NOM), but is
   different to reports on size-fractionated (ultrafiltration through 15-1
   kDa membranes) effluent organic matter (EfOM). We attribute this
   difference to the larger molecular weight distributions in
   size-fractionated EfOM compared to NOM.
   The k (DOM-HO center dot) values in this study ranged over a factor of
   10, suggesting that hydroxyl radical reactivity does depend on the
   sample composition; however, no major correlation was found between the
   measured reactivity and bulk physicochemical properties of DOM.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid increase in anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases, mainly
   carbon dioxide, has been a growing cause for concern. While
   photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) into solar fuels can
   provide a solution, lack of insight into energetic pathways governing
   photocatalysis has impeded study. Here, we utilize measurements of
   electronic density of states (DOS), using scanning tunneling
   microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), to identify energy levels responsible
   for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 water in an artificial
   photosynthetic process. We introduce desired states in titanium dioxide
   (TiO2) nanoparticles, using metal dopants or semiconductor nanocrystals,
   and the designed catalysts were used for selective reduction of CO2 into
   hydrocarbons, alcohols, and aldehydes. Using a simple model, we provide
   insights into the photophysics governing this multielectron reduction
   and design a new composite photocatalyst based on overlapping energy
   states of TiO2 and copper indium sulfide (CIS) nanocrystals. These
   nanoparticles demonstrate the highest selectivity for ethane (>70\%) and
   a higher efficiency of converting ultraviolet radiation into fuels
   (4.3\%) using concentrated sunlight (>4 Sun illumination), compared with
   platinum-doped TiO2 nanoparticles (2.1\%), and utilize hot electrons to
   tune the solar fuel from alkancs to aldehydes. These results can have
   important implications for the development of new inexpensive
   photocatalysts with tuned activity and selectivity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies level set topology optimization of structures
   predicting the structural response by the eXtended Finite Element Method
   (XFEM). In contrast to Ersatz material approaches, the XFEM represents
   the geometry in the mechanical model by crisp boundaries. The
   traditional XFEM approach augments the approximation of the state
   variable fields with a fixed set of enrichment functions. For complex
   material layouts with small geometric features, this strategy may result
   in interpolation errors and non-physical coupling between disconnected
   material domains. These defects can lead to numerical instabilities in
   the optimized material layout, similar to checker-board patterns found
   in density methods. In this paper, a generalized Heaviside enrichment
   strategy is presented that adapts the set of enrichment functions to the
   material layout and consistently interpolates the state variable fields,
   bypassing the limitations of the traditional approach. This XFEM
   formulation is embedded into a level set topology optimization framework
   and studied with ``material-void{''} and ``material-material{''} design
   problems, optimizing the compliance via a mathematical programming
   method. The numerical results suggest that the generalized formulation
   of the XFEM resolves numerical instabilities, but regularization
   techniques are still required to control the optimized geometry. It is
   observed that constraining the perimeter effectively eliminates the
   emergence of small geometric features. In contrast, smoothing the level
   set field does not provide a reliable geometry control but mainly
   improves the convergence rate of the optimization process.}},

Abstract = {{There have been a number of recent advances in probabilistic assessment
   of seismic-induced losses for individual buildings. However, the
   possible losses for a portfolio of buildings are of interest for
   insurance and reinsurance companies, developers, and policy makers.
   Probabilistic estimates of earthquake-induced losses to portfolios of
   buildings require quantifying correlations between losses of the
   different buildings comprising the building stock. This article examines
   spatial correlations in building seismic responses, showing that
   correlations are significant for closely spaced buildings (i.e., with
   site-separation distances of up to 25-65 km, depending on the
   earthquake) and for buildings with similar first-mode periods. The
   results demonstrate that correlation patterns in building response
   parameters are closely linked to a linear ground-motion intensity
   measure, spectral acceleration measured at the buildings' first-mode
   periods. Based on this finding, enhancements are proposed to
   state-of-the-art methods for regional loss assessment to account for
   correlations in building response. These enhancements define a
   transformation between groundmotion intensity and building response that
   preserves the expected correlation for building responses. These
   building responses then provide the basis for computation of
   earthquake-induced losses in the regional building stock.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of DC electric field on sintering, and on the electrical
   conductivity of undoped rutile, TiO2 (99.99\%), has been investigated at
   fields ranging from 0V to 1000V/cm. The experiments were carried out at
   a constant heating rate of 10 degrees C/min with the furnace
   temperatures reaching up to 1150 degrees C. The sintering behavior falls
   into two regimes: at lower fields, up to 150V/cm, sintering is enhanced,
   but densification occurs gradually with time (Type A or FAST sintering).
   At higher fields sintering occurs abruptly, and is accompanied by a
   highly nonlinear increase in conductivity, which has been called flash
   sintering (Type B or FLASH sintering). Arrhenius plots of conductivity
   yield an activation energy of 1.6eV in Type A and 0.6eV in Type B
   behavior; the first is explained as ionic and the second as electronic
   conductivity. The evolution of grain size under both types of sintering
   behavior are reported. These results highlight that the dominant
   mechanism of field-assisted sintering can change with the field strength
   and temperature. We are in the very early stages of identifying these
   mechanisms and mapping them in the field, frequency, and temperature
   space.}},

Abstract = {{A new cold-formed steel corrugated shear wall seismic force resisting
   system has been recently developed by Tipping Mar and Associates of

   curve is estimated by non-linear static analysis. Cyclic deterioration
   parameters are determined by genetic algorithm optimization method.

   dissolved organic matter}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Pages = {{327-338}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The use of fluorescence spectroscopy for the analysis and
   characterization of dissolved organic matter (DOM) has gained widespread
   interest over the past decade, in part because of its ease of use and
   ability to provide bulk DOM chemical characteristics. However, the lack
   of standard approaches for analysis and data evaluation has complicated
   its use. This study utilized comparative statistics to systematically
   evaluate commonly used fluorescence metrics for DOM characterization to
   provide insight into the implications for data analysis and
   interpretation such as peak picking methods, carbon-normalized metrics
   and the fluorescence index (Fl). The uncertainty associated with peak
   picking methods was evaluated, including the reporting of peak intensity
   and peak position. The linear relationship between fluorescence
   intensity and dissolved organic carbon (Doc) concentration was found to
   deviate from linearity at environmentally relevant concentrations and
   simultaneously across all peak regions. Comparative analysis suggests
   that the loss of linearity is composition specific and likely due to
   non-ideal intermolecular interactions of the DOM rather than the inner
   filter effects. For some DOM sources, Peak A deviated from linearity at
   optical densities a factor of 2 higher than that of Peak C. For
   carbon-normalized fluorescence intensities, the error associated with
   DOC measurements significantly decreases the ability to distinguish
   compositional differences. An in-depth analysis of Fl determined that
   the metric is mostly driven by peak emission wavelength and less by
   emission spectra slope. This study also demonstrates that fluorescence
   intensity follows property balance principles, but the fluorescence
   index does not. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{81}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A complete set of potential functions consisting of three scalar
   functions is presented for coupled displacement-temperature equations of
   motion and heat equation for an arbitrary x(3)-convex domain containing
   a linear thermoelastic transversely isotropic material, where the
   x(3)-axis is parallel to the axis of symmetry of the material. The proof
   of the completeness theorem is based on a retarded logarithmic potential
   function, retarded Newtonian potential function, repeated wave equation,
   the extended Boggio's theorem for the transversely isotropic axially
   convex domain, and the existence of a solution for the heat equation. It
   is shown that the solution degenerates to a set of complete potential
   functions for elastodynamics and elastostatics under certain conditions.
   In a special case, the number of potential functions is reduced to one,
   and the required conditions are discussed. Another special case involves
   the rotationally symmetric configuration with respect to the axis of
   symmetry of the material.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A model predictive control (MPC) system for a solar-thermal reactor was
   developed and applied to the solar-thermal steam-gasification of carbon.
   The controller aims at rejecting the disturbances in solar irradiance,
   caused by the presence of clouds. Changes in solar irradiance are
   anticipated using direct normal irradiance (DNI) forecasts generated
   using images acquired through a Total Sky Imager (TSI). The DNI
   predictor provides an estimation of the disturbances for the control
   algorithm, for a time horizon of 1 min. The proposed predictor utilizes
   information obtained through the analysis of sky images, in combination
   with current atmospheric measurements, to produce the DNI forecast. The
   predictions of the disturbances are used, in combination with a dynamic
   model of the process, to determine the required control moves at every
   time step. The performance of the proposed DNI predictor-controller
   scheme was compared to the performance of an equivalent MPC that does
   not use DNI forecasts in the calculation of the control signals. In
   addition, the performance of a controller fed with perfect DNI
   predictions was also evaluated.}},

Title = {{Effect of flow rate and subcooling on spray heat transfer on microporous
   copper surfaces}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{493-505}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we experimentally investigated spray boiling heat transfer
   performance with degassed HFE-7100 as the coolant on a conductive
   microporous copper surface, and observed enhanced heat transfer
   performance compared to that on a plain surface. Spray heat transfer
   data were measured using two full-cone spray nozzles spanning a range of
   volumetric flow rate from 1.1 cm(3)/s to 15.8 cm(3)/s. We also
   investigated the effect of different liquid subcooling levels ranging
   from 30 degrees C to 0 degrees C on the heat transfer data. Spray
   impingement on the microporous surface showed an enhancement of
   300-600\% in the heat transfer coefficient at a given wall superheat
   compared to spray impingement on a plain surface. The critical heat flux
   also increased by up to 80\% for the case of spray impingement on a
   microporous coated surface as compared to impingement on a plain
   surface, depending on the flow rates and the subcooling levels. Contrary
   to the results in the literature, for a given nozzle we observed that
   the liquid spray at near-saturated temperature (0 degrees C subcooling)
   had higher heat transfer performance and critical heat flux than the
   subcooled spray on both plain and microporous surfaces except at the
   lowest flow rates. This likely results from the limited residence time
   of the liquid droplets in contact with the heater surface and the much
   higher efficiency of phase change heat transfer. The near-saturated
   spray undergoes phase change much faster than the subcooled liquid,
   removing heat more efficiently than the subcooled liquid. A modified
   correlation, based on the Estes-Mudawar correlation (1995) 122],
   utilizing the experimental data from the present study and literature is
   proposed for the critical heat flux for spray impingement on both plain
   and microporous surfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring sea surface height (SSH) using satellite altimetry in coastal
   (<7 km from coasts) and shallow water region has long been a challenge
   since the radar altimeter waveforms are often contaminated by complex
   coastal topography and do not conform to theoretical Brown waveform
   shapes. The land contamination or surface variation due to ocean
   dynamics induce spurious peaks in altimeter waveforms that deviate from
   Brown's theoretical model as the altimeter footprint approaches or
   leaves the shoreline. These spurious peaks should be mitigated to
   minimize the error in the determination of the leading edge and
   associated track offset in the waveform retracking process. Here, we
   introduce a novel algorithm to modify coastal waveforms (0.5-7 km from
   coasts, using 20 Hz altimetry data), thus improving coastal data
   coverage and accuracy. We apply our processing algorithm and use various
   retrackers to compare retrieved coastal SSHs in four study regions in
   North America, using both Envisat and Jason-2 altimetry. The retrieved
   altimetry data in the 1-7 km coastal zone indicate that the 20\%
   Threshold retracker with modified waveform has a RMSE of 21 cm as
   compared with in situ tide gauge data, which corresponds to a 63\%
   improvement in accuracy compared to the use of the original deep-ocean
   waveform retracker.}},

Abstract = {{Forecasting of localized debris congestion in the geostationary (GEO)
   regime is performed to investigate how frequently near-miss events occur
   for each of the longitude slots in the GEO ring. The present-day
   resident space object (RSO) population at GEO is propagated forward in
   time to determine current debris congestion conditions, and new
   probability density functions that describe where GEO satellites are
   inserted into operational orbits are harnessed to assess
   longitude-dependent congestion in ``business-as-usual{''} launch
   traffic, with and without re-orbiting at end-of-life. Congestion
   forecasting for a 50-year period is presented to illustrate the need for
   appropriately executed mitigation measures in the GEO ring. Results
   indicate that localized debris congestion will double within 50 years
   under current 80\% re-orbiting success rates. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by

Abstract = {{Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) use biodegradable substrates, such as
   wastewater and marine sediments to generate electrical energy. To
   harvest more energy from an MFC, power electronic converters have
   recently been used to replace resistors or charge pumps, because they
   have superior controllability on MFC's operating point and higher
   efficiency in energy storage for different applications. Conventional
   diode-based energy harvesters suffer from low efficiency because of the
   energy losses through the diode. Replacing the diode with a MOSFET can
   reduce the conduction loss, but it requires an isolated gate signal to
   control the floating secondary MOSFET, which makes the control circuitry
   complex. This study presents a new MFC energy harvesting regime using a
   synchronous flyback converter, which implements a transformer-based
   harvester with much simpler configuration and improves harvesting
   efficiency by 37.6\% compared to a diode based boost converter, from
   33.5\% to 46.1\%. The proposed harvester was able to store 2.27 J in the
   output capacitor out of 4.91 J generated energy from the MFC, while the
   boost converter can capture 1.67 J from 4.95 J. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Typical radar transmitter signals are frequency-modulated with pulsed
   constant-amplitude envelopes in order to optimize radio-frequency power
   amplifier (RFPA) efficiency, which results in spectral broadening and
   power radiated outside of the radar frequency band. This problem can be
   alleviated by using an appropriately shaped pulse envelope, provided
   that high-efficiency operation of the radar transmitter is maintained.
   This paper introduces a pulse-shaping power supply for RFPAs in radar
   transmitters which enables high efficiency while reducing the spectral
   emissions. The pulse-shaping power supply is a simple switched resonant
   circuit capable of approximating a Gaussian pulse envelope waveform.
   Operating principles are presented and a state-plane-based design
   approach is described for the resonant pulse-shaping power supply, which
   enables improved waveform quality and efficiency. An experimental
   prototype with efficiency greater than 90\% is used to supply a 2.14-GHz
   GaN RFPA. The RFPA efficiency of up to 76\%, overall transmitter
   efficiency of up to 67\%, and output signal having high spectral purity
   demonstrate feasibility of a high-efficiency, high-performance radar
   system.}},

Abstract = {{A detailed vibrational analysis of the infrared spectra of
   cyclopentadienone (C5H4=O) in rare gas matrices has been carried out. Ab
   initio coupled-cluster anharmonic force field calculations were used to
   guide the assignments. Flash pyrolysis of o-phenylene sulfite (C6H4O2SO)
   was used to provide a molecular beam of C5H4=O entrained in a rare gas
   carrier. The beam was interrogated with time-of-flight photoionization
   mass spectrometry (PIS), confirming the clean, intense production of
   C5H4=O. Matrix isolation infrared spectroscopy coupled with 355 nm
   polarized UV for photoorientation and linear dichroism experiments was
   used to determine the symmetries of the vibrations. Cyclopentadienone
   has 24 fundamental vibrational modes, Gamma(vib) = 9a(1), circle plus
   3a(2) circle plus 4b(1), circle plus 8b(2). Using vibrational
   perturbation theory and a deperturbation-diagonalization method, we
   report assignments of the following fundamental modes (cm(-1)) in a 4 K
   neon matrix: the a(1) modes of (X) over tilde (1)A(1), C5H4=O are found
   to be nu(1) = 3107, nu(2) = (3100, 3099), nu(3) = 1735, nu(5) = 1333,
   nu(7) = 952, nu(8) = 843, and nu(9) = 651; the inferred a(2) modes are
   nu(10) = 933, and nu(11), = 722; the b(1) modes are nu(13) = 932, nu(14)
   = 822, and nu(15) = 629; the b(2) fundamentals are nu(17) = 3143, nu(18)
   = (3078, 3076) nu(19) = (1601 or 1595), nu(20) = 1283, nu(21) = 1138,
   nu(22) = 1066, nu(23) = 738, and nu(24) = 458. The modes nu(4) and nu(6)
   were too weak to be detected, nu(12) is dipole-forbidden and its
   position cannot be inferred from combination and overtone bands, and
   nu(16) is below our detection range (<400 cm(-1)). Additional features
   were observed and compared to anharmonic calculations, assigned as two
   quantum transitions, and used to assign some of the weak and infrared
   inactive fundamental vibrations.}},

Title = {{Inference and uncertainty of snow depth spatial distribution at the
   kilometre scale in the Colorado Rocky Mountains: the effects of sample
   size, random sampling, predictor quality, and validation procedures}},

Abstract = {{Historically, observing snow depth over large areas has been difficult.
   When snow depth observations are sparse, regression models can be used
   to infer the snow depth over a given area. Data sparsity has also left
   many important questions about such inference unexamined. Improved
   inference, or estimation, of snow depth and its spatial distribution
   from a given set of observations can benefit a wide range of
   applications from water resource management, to ecological studies, to
   validation of satellite estimates of snow pack. The development of Light
   Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has provided non-sparse snow
   depth measurements, which we use in this study, to address fundamental
   questions about snow depth inference using both sparse and non-sparse
   observations. For example, when are more data needed and when are data
   redundant? Results apply to both traditional and manual snow depth
   measurements and to LiDAR observations. Through sampling experiments on
   high-resolution LiDAR snow depth observations at six separate 1.17-km(2)
   sites in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, we provide novel perspectives on
   a variety of issues affecting the regression estimation of snow depth
   from sparse observations. We measure the effects of observation count,
   random selection of observations, quality of predictor variables, and
   cross-validation procedures using three skill metrics: percent error in
   total snow volume, root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-2. Extremes of
   predictor quality are used to understand the range of its effect; how do
   predictors downloaded from internet perform against more accurate
   predictors measured by LiDAR? Whereas cross validation remains the only
   option for validating inference from sparse observations, in our
   experiments, the full set of LiDAR-measured snow depths can be
   considered the true' spatial distribution and used to understand
   cross-validation bias at the spatial scale of inference. We model at the
   30-m resolution of readily available predictors, which is a popular
   spatial resolution in the literature. Three regression models are also
   compared, and we briefly examine how sampling design affects model
   skill. Results quantify the primary dependence of each skill metric on
   observation count that ranges over three orders of magnitude, doubling
   at each step from 25 up to 3200. Whereas uncertainty (resulting from
   random selection of observations) in percent error of true total snow
   volume is typically well constrained by 100-200 observations, there is
   considerable uncertainty in the inferred spatial distribution (R-2) even
   at medium observation counts (200-800). We show that percent error in
   total snow volume is not sensitive to predictor quality, although RMSE
   and R-2 (measures of spatial distribution) often depend critically on
   it. Inaccuracies of downloaded predictors (most often the vegetation
   predictors) can easily require a quadrupling of observation count to
   match RMSE and R-2 scores obtained by LiDAR-measured predictors. Under
   cross validation, the RMSE and R-2 skill measures are consistently
   biased towards poorer results than their true validations. This is
   primarily a result of greater variance at the spatial scales of point
   observations used for cross validation than at the 30-m resolution of
   the model. The magnitude of this bias depends on individual site
   characteristics, observation count (for our experimental design), and
   sampling design.
   Sampling designs that maximize independent information maximize
   cross-validation bias but also maximize true R-2. The bagging tree model
   is found to generally outperform the other regression models in the
   study on several criteria. Finally, we discuss and recommend use of
   LiDAR in conjunction with regression modelling to advance understanding
   of snow depth spatial distribution at spatial scales of thousands of
   square kilometres. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The dynamics of polymers adsorbed to a solid surface are important in
   thin-film formation, adhesion phenomena, and biosensing applications,
   but they are still poorly understood. Here we present tracking data that
   follow the dynamics of isolated poly(ethylene glycol) chains adsorbed at
   a hydrophobic solid-liquid interface. We found that molecules moved on
   the surface via a continuous-time random walk mechanism, where periods
   of immobilization were punctuated by desorption-mediated jumps. The
   dependence of the surface mobility on molecular weight (2, 5, 10, 20,
   and 40 kg/mol were investigated) suggested that surface-adsorbed
   polymers maintained effectively three-dimensional surface conformations.
   These results indicate that polymer surface diffusion, rather than
   occurring in the two dimensions of the interface, is dominated by a
   three-dimensional mechanism that leads to large surface displacements
   and significant bulk-surface coupling.}},

   emission of Ozone precursors intensive (BioCORN 2011), in a cornfield NW
   of Fort Collins, CO. Mixing ratios varied from below detection limit
   (similar to 0.003 ppbv) to over 1.2 ppbv during a period when
   agricultural burning impacted the BAO Tower site. Urban areas, such as
   the CalNex 2010 Pasadena site, appear to have both primary (combustion)
   and secondary (photochemical) sources of HNCO, 50 +/- 9\%, and 33 +/-
   12\%, respectively, while primary sources were responsible for the large
   mixing ratios of HNCO observed during the wintertime NACHTT study in
   suburban Colorado. Isocyanic acid during the BioCORN study in rural NE
   Colorado was closely correlated to ozone and therefore likely
   photochemically produced as a secondary product from amines or
   formamide. The removal of HNCO from the lower atmosphere is thought to
   be due to deposition, as common gas phase loss processes of photolysis
   and reactions with hydroxyl radicals, are slow. These ambient
   measurements are consistent with some HNCO deposition, which was evident
   at night at these surface sites.}},

Abstract = {{The potential of freeze-thaw cycles to release colloids and
   colloid-associated contaminants into water is unknown. We examined the
   effect of freeze-thaw cycles on the mobilization of cesium and strontium
   in association with colloids in intact cores of a fractured soil, where
   preferential flow paths are prevalent. Two intact cores were
   contaminated with cesium and strontium. To mobilize colloids and metal
   cations sequestered in the soil cores, each core was subjected to 10
   intermittent wetting events separated by 66 4 pauses. During the first
   five pauses, the cores were dried at room temperature, and during last
   five pauses; the cores were subjected to 42 h of freezing followed by 24
   h of thawing. In comparison to drying, freeze-thaw cycles created
   additional preferential flow paths through which colloids, cesium, and
   strontium were mobilized. The wetting events following freeze-thaw
   intervals mobilized about twice as many colloids as wetting events
   following drying at room temperature. Successive wetting events
   following 66 h of drying mobilized similar amounts of colloids; in
   contrast, successive wetting events after 66 h of freeze-thaw intervals
   mobilized greater amounts of colloids than the previous one. Drying and
   freeze-thaw treatments, respectively, increased and decreased the
   dissolved cesium and strontium, but both treatments increased the
   colloidal cesium and strontium. Overall, the freeze-thaw cycles
   increased the mobilization of metal contaminants primarily in
   association with colloids through preferential flow paths. These
   findings suggest that the mobilization of colloid and colloid-associated
   contaminants could increase when temperature variations occur around the
   freezing point of water. Thus, climate extremes have the potential to
   mobilize contaminants that have been sequestered in the vadose zone for
   decades.}},

Title = {{STATISTICAL PROPERTIES OF SUPER-HOT SOLAR FLARES}},
Journal = {{ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{781}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{We use Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI)
   high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy observations from similar to 6
   to 100 keV to determine the statistical relationships between measured
   parameters (temperature, emission measure, etc.) of hot, thermal plasma
   in 37 intense (GOES M-and X-class) solar flares. The RHESSI data, most
   sensitive to the hottest flare plasmas, reveal a strong correlation
   between the maximum achieved temperature and the flare GOES class, such
   that ``super-hot{''} temperatures >30 MK are achieved almost exclusively
   by X-class events; the observed correlation differs significantly from
   that of GOES-derived temperatures, and from previous studies. A nearly
   ubiquitous association with high emission measures, electron densities,
   and instantaneous thermal energies suggests that super-hot plasmas are
   physically distinct from cooler, similar to 10-20 MK GOES plasmas, and
   that they require substantially greater energy input during the flare.
   High thermal energy densities suggest that super-hot flares require
   strong coronal magnetic fields, exceeding similar to 100 G, and that
   both the plasma beta and volume filling factor f cannot be much less
   than unity in the super-hot region.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the lack of a geomagnetic storm (based on the Dst index),
   relativistic electron fluxes were enhanced over 2.5 orders of magnitude
   in the outer radiation belt in 13h on 13-14 January 2013. The unusual
   enhancement was observed by Magnetic Electron Ion Spectrometer (MagEIS),
   onboard the Van Allen Probes; Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope
   Integrated Little Experiment, onboard the Colorado Student Space Weather
   Experiment; and Solid State Telescope, onboard Time History of Events
   and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS). Analyses of
   MagEIS phase space density (PSD) profiles show a positive outward radial
   gradient from 4<L<5.5. However, THEMIS observations show a peak in PSD
   outside of the Van Allen Probes' apogee, which suggest a very
   interesting scenario: wave-particle interactions causing a PSD peak at
   similar to L{*}=5.5 from where the electrons are then rapidly
   transported radially inward. This letter demonstrates, for the first
   time in detail, that geomagnetic storms are not necessary for causing
   dramatic enhancements in the outer radiation belt.}},

Title = {{Multisite stochastic weather generation using cluster analysis and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{508}},
Pages = {{197-213}},

Abstract = {{We offer a multisite stochastic weather generator which is an
   enhancement to the traditional K-nearest neighbor resampling approach.
   The proposed weather generator consists of three main components: (i)
   Clustering of spatial locations into homogeneous regions based on a
   selected attribute (precipitation), (ii) Markov transition probabilities
   (either on individual clusters or) over all eight wet/dry states of the
   three-cluster system to model the spatial precipitation occurrence, and
   (iii) the traditional K-NN weather generator applied to each
   cluster-averaged weather time series to generate weather sequences at
   all the desired locations. The weather generator is also adapted to
   conditional simulation based on seasonal forecasts involving
   modification of the third component. We demonstrate the utility of this
   approach by simulating daily weather sequences at 66 locations in the
   25,000 sq. mile San Juan River watershed, a tributary of the Colorado
   River, USA. As the classic K-NN approach involves sampling from a
   domain-averaged feature vector, all daily weather is simulated across
   all locations simultaneously. While this preserves the joint statistics,
   it tends to be biased to the extremes on any given day. Our
   cluster-based approach offers the ability to account for regional
   persistence and spatial non-stationarities. In our comparison of the
   methods, the cluster-based approach demonstrates some improvement over
   the classic approach, particularly when modeling winter precipitation,
   reproducing spells, and in dry years. While this particular application
   shows only marginal improvement, we offer cluster-based resampling as a
   novel methodological contribution. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We use a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to interpret
   aircraft curtain observations of black carbon (BC) aerosol over the
   Pacific from 85 degrees N to 67 degrees S during the 2009-2011 HIAPER
   (High-Performance Instrumented Airborne Platform for Environmental
   Research) Pole-to-Pole Observations (HIPPO) campaigns. Observed
   concentrations are very low, implying much more efficient scavenging
   than is usually implemented in models. Our simulation with a global
   source of 6.5 Tg a(-1) and mean tropospheric lifetime of 4.2days (versus
   6.81.8days for the Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models
   (AeroCom) models) successfully simulates BC concentrations in source
   regions and continental outflow and captures the principal features of
   the HIPPO data but is still higher by a factor of 2 (1.48 for column
   loads) over the Pacific. It underestimates BC absorbing aerosol optical
   depths (AAODs) from the Aerosol Robotic Network by 32\% on a global
   basis. Only 8.7\% of global BC loading in GEOS-Chem is above 5km, versus
   2111\% for the AeroCom models, with important implications for radiative
   forcing estimates. Our simulation yields a global BC burden of 77 Gg, a
   global mean BC AAOD of 0.0017, and a top-of-atmosphere direct radiative
   forcing (TOA DRF) of 0.19Wm(-2), with a range of 0.17-0.31Wm(-2) based
   on uncertainties in the BC atmospheric distribution. Our TOA DRF is
   lower than previous estimates (0.270.06Wm(-2) in AeroCom, 0.65-0.9Wm(-2)
   in more recent studies). We argue that these previous estimates are
   biased high because of excessive BC concentrations over the oceans and
   in the free troposphere.}},

Abstract = {{W126 is a cumulative ozone exposure index based on sigmoidally weighted
   daytime ozone concentrations used to evaluate the impacts of ozone on
   vegetation. We quantify W126 in the U.S. in the absence of North
   American anthropogenic emissions (North American background or NAB)
   using three regional or global chemical transport models for May-July
   2010. All models overestimate W126 in the eastern U.S. due to a
   persistent bias in daytime ozone, while the models are relatively
   unbiased in California and the Intermountain West. Substantial
   difference in the magnitude and spatial and temporal variability of the
   estimates of W126 NAB between models supports the need for a multimodel
   approach. While the average NAB contribution to daytime ozone in the
   Intermountain West is 64-78\%, the average W126 NAB is only 9-27\% of
   current levels, owing to the weight given to high O-3 concentrations in
   W126. Based on a three-model mean, NAB explains similar to 30\% of the
   daily variability in the W126 daily index in the Intermountain West.
   Adjoint sensitivity analysis shows that nationwide W126 is influenced
   most by NOx emissions from anthropogenic (58\% of the total sensitivity)
   and natural (25\%) sources followed by nonmethane volatile organic
   compounds (10\%) and CO (7\%). Most of the influence of anthropogenic
   NOx comes from the U.S. (80\%), followed by Canada (9\%), Mexico (4\%),
   and China (3\%). Thus, long-range transport of pollution has a
   relatively small impact on W126 in the U.S., and domestic emissions
   control should be effective for reducing W126 levels.}},

Title = {{Unpacking the `information barrier': Comparing perspectives on
   information as a barrier to climate change adaptation in the interior
   mountain West}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{133}},
Pages = {{397-410}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Inadequate information has been repeatedly identified as a barrier to
   climate change adaptation planning and implementation. However less is
   known about how information functions as a barrier, and to what degree
   it prevents adaptation compared to other perceived barriers. In
   addition, the role of institutional context in mediating the demand for
   information in the context of adaptation has been less well studied.
   This paper helps to clarify the role that information plays in
   adaptation planning for two sectors of public employees working at
   similar scales, in similar locations, with similar challenges. We
   conducted surveys and semi-structured interviews to investigate the
   demand for information in support of adaptation implementation and
   planning from US federal public lands managers and municipal officials
   in the US interior West. We found that federal managers and municipal
   officials both consulted information frequently for decision making, and
   while both groups indicated that lack of information at relevant scales
   was a barrier to adaptation planning, this was seen as a much stronger
   barrier for federal managers than for communities. Uncertainty of
   information was raised as an issue, but results were mixed on whether or
   not this acted as a strong barrier. While peer-reviewed publications
   were seen as the ``best available science,{''} and correlated with
   adaptation planning, they were not accessed directly as frequently as
   other sources of information, including colleagues, the Internet and
   reports. The strong connection between communities and adjacent federal
   lands may provide an opportunity for networking that could facilitate
   the flow of information relevant for adaptation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Interpretation of volatile organic compound measurements by
   proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry over the deepwater horizon
   oil spill}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MASS SPECTROMETRY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{358}},
Pages = {{43-48}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{A proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) was used onboard
   the NOAA WP-3D aircraft for atmospheric measurements over the Deepwater
   Horizon (DWH) oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. A mass spectrum
   obtained by PTR-MS downwind from the accident site revealed the presence
   of a complex mixture of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Here, we
   interpret this mass spectrum by comparing it with mass spectra of crude
   oil, gasoline and diesel samples measured in the laboratory. Aromatics
   were less abundant over the spill than from crude oil samples, due to
   the dissolution of these species in the seawater. The mass spectra
   obtained from aircraft measurements and crude oil samples both show
   strong signals at masses with mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of 14 x n +/-
   1, including 43, 57, 69, 71, 83, 85, 97 and 111Yamu. PTR-MS coupled with
   a gas chromatograph was used to identify major mass signals from crude
   oil samples. Cycloalkanes are important contributors to the signals of
   mass m/z 14 x n +/- 1, especially for masses 69, 83,97 and 111 amu.
   Aromatics could be interpreted from their specific masses without
   significant interference for crude oil vapors, but the interferences to
   benzene from higher aromatics can be significant as crude oil
   evaporates. The interpretation of DWH mass spectrum is not only helpful
   in understanding the atmospheric emissions associated with the DWH oil
   spill, but also for the interpretation of PTR-MS measurements in urban
   air, near natural oil seeps and oil as well as natural gas extraction
   activities. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate broadband waveguide crossing arrays

   operation is the tailored excitation of a low-loss spatial Bloch wave
   formed by matching the periodicity of the crossing array to the
   difference in propagation constants of the first-and third-order TE-like
   modes of a multimode silicon waveguide. Radiative scattering at the
   crossing points acts like a periodic imaginary-permittivity perturbation
   that couples two supermodes, which results in imaginary (radiative)
   propagation-constant splitting and gives rise to a low-loss,
   unidirectional breathing Bloch wave. This type of crossing array
   provides a robust implementation of a key component enabling dense

Abstract = {{The key attribute of the thiol-Michael addition reaction that makes it a
   prized tool in materials science is its modular ``click{''} nature,

   dedicated to elucidating different aspects of the reaction that range
   from an in-depth analysis aimed at understanding the mechanistic
   pathways of the reaction to synthetic studies that have examined
   modifying molecular structures with the aim of yielding highly efficient
   thiol-Michael reaction monomers. This review examines the reaction
   mechanisms, the substrates and catalysts used in the reaction, and the

   similar to 1-nm resolution, revealing a conformation closely resembling
   the nonconducting state. The generality of this approach has been
   addressed by the successful preparation of MPPNs for two unrelated
   proteins, the mechanosensitive channel of large conductance and the
   connexon Cx26, using a recently devised microfluidics-based free
   interface diffusion system. MPPNs provide not only a starting point for
   the structural analysis of membrane proteins in a phospholipid
   environment, but their closed surfaces should facilitate studies in the
   presence of physiological transmembrane gradients, in addition to
   potential applications as drug delivery carriers or as templates for
   inorganic nanoparticle formation.}},

Abstract = {{The specificity of chemical reactions conducted over solid catalysts can
   potentially be improved by utilizing noncovalent interactions to direct
   reactant binding geometry. Here we apply thiolate self-assembled
   monolayers (SAMs) with an appropriate structure to Pt/Al2O3 catalysts to
   selectively orient the reactant molecule cinnamaldehyde in a
   configuration associated with hydrogenation to the desired product
   cinnamyl alcohol. While nonspecific effects on the surface active site
   were shown to generally enhance selectivity, specific aromatic stacking
   interactions between the phenyl ring of cinnamaldehyde and phenylated
   SAMs allowed tuning of reaction selectivity without compromising the
   rate of desired product formation. Infrared spectroscopy showed that
   increased selectivity was a result of favorable orientation of the
   reactant on the catalyst surface. In contrast, hydrogenation of an
   unsaturated aldehyde without a phenyl ring showed a nontunable
   improvement in selectivity, indicating that thiol SAMs can improve
   reaction selectivity through a combination of nonspecific surface
   effects and ligand-specific near-surface effects.}},

Title = {{A qualitative comparative analysis of well-managed school sanitation in
   Bangladesh}},
Journal = {{BMC PUBLIC HEALTH}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JAN 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Continued management of sanitation and hygiene services,
   post-intervention, is a global challenge, particularly in the
   school-setting. This situation threatens anticipated impacts of school
   sanitation and hygiene investments. To improve programming and policies,
   and increase the effectiveness of limited development resources, we seek
   to understand how and why some schools have well-managed sanitation
   post-intervention, while others do not.
   Methods: Based on in-depth qualitative data from 16 case schools in
   Meherpur, Bangladesh, we employ fuzzy-set qualitative comparative
   analysis to identify the necessary and sufficient conditions, or
   combinations of conditions (referred to as pathways), that lead to
   either well-managed or poorly managed school sanitation. We include
   posited sustainability determinants from the literature and factors that
   emerged from the cases themselves in the analysis.
   Results: We identified three distinct pathways sufficient to support
   well-managed services, providing multiple options for how well-managed
   school sanitation could be encouraged. Two of these are applicable to
   both government and non-government schools: (1) quality construction,
   financial community support and a champion; and (2) quality
   construction, financial government support, a maintenance plan and
   school management committee involvement. On-going financial support for
   operations and maintenance was identified as a necessary condition for
   continued service management, which was absent from many schools with
   poorly managed services. However, financial support was insufficient
   alone and other conditions are needed in conjunction, including quality
   construction and incentivizing conditions, such as school management
   committee involvement in sanitation specifically, a sanitation champion,
   and/or one teacher clearly responsible for toilet maintenance.
   Surprisingly, the number of students per toilet (ranging from 18-95
   students) and toilet age (ranging from 8-32 months) had no significant
   effect on sanitation conditions.
   Conclusions: Findings corroborate those from a similar study in Belize,
   and comparison suggests the need for financial community support and the
   possibly tenuous reliance on local champions in the absence of adequate
   government support for operations and maintenance. Sub-determinants to
   the necessary conditions are also discussed which have implications for
   school sanitation in Bangladesh and may have broader relevance for other
   low-income countries though further research is needed.}},

Abstract = {{Adenovirus is regarded as the most resistant pathogen to ultraviolet
   (UV) disinfection due to its demonstrated resistance to monochromatic,
   low-pressure (LP) UV irradiation at 254 nm. This resistance has resulted
   in high UV dose requirements for all viruses in regulations set by the
   United States Environmental Protection Agency. Polychromatic,
   medium-pressure (MP) UV irradiation has been shown to be much more
   effective than 254 nm, although the mechanisms of polychromatic UV
   inactivation are not completely understood. This research analyzes the
   wavelength-specific effects of UV light on adenovirus type 2 by
   analyzing in parallel the reduction in viral infectivity and damage to
   the viral genome. A tunable laser from the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology was used to isolate single UV wavelengths. Cell
   culture infectivity and PCR were employed to quantify the adenoviral
   inactivation rates using narrow bands of irradiation (<1 nm) at 10 nm
   intervals between 210 and 290 nm. The inactivation rate corresponding to
   adenoviral genome damage matched the inactivation rate of adenovirus
   infectivity at 253.7 nm, 270 nm, 280 nm, and 290 nm, suggesting that
   damage to the viral DNA was primarily responsible for loss of
   infectivity at those wavelengths. At 260 nm, more damage to the nucleic
   acid was observed than reduction in viral infectivity. At 240 nm and
   below, the reduction of viral infectivity was significantly greater than
   the reduction of DNA amplification, suggesting that UV damage to a viral
   component other than DNA contributed to the loss of infectivity at those
   wavelengths. Inactivation rates were used to develop. a detailed
   spectral sensitivity or action spectrum of adenovirus 2. This research
   has significant implications for the water treatment industry with
   regard to polychromatic inactivation of viruses and the development of
   novel wavelength-specific UV disinfection technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Pancreatic islets of Langerhans regulate blood glucose homeostasis by
   the secretion of the hormone insulin. Like many neuroendocrine cells,
   the coupling between insulin-secreting beta-cells in the islet is
   critical for the dynamics of hormone secretion. We have examined how
   this coupling architecture regulates the electrical dynamics that
   underlie insulin secretion by utilizing a microwell-based aggregation
   method to generate clusters of a beta-cell line with defined sizes and
   dimensions. We measured the dynamics of free-calcium activity
   ({[}Ca2+](i)) and insulin secretion and compared these measurements with
   a percolating network model. We observed that the coupling dimension was
   critical for regulating {[}Ca2+](i) dynamics and insulin secretion.
   Three-dimensional coupling led to size-invariant suppression of
   {[}Ca2+](i) at low glucose and robust synchronized {[}Ca2+](i)
   oscillations at elevated glucose, whereas two-dimensional coupling
   showed poor suppression and less robust synchronization, with
   significant size-dependence. The dimension- and size-scaling of
   {[}Ca2+](i) at high and low glucose could be accurately described with
   the percolating network model, using similar network connectivity. As
   such this could explain the fundamentally different behavior and
   size-scaling observed under each coupling dimension. This study
   highlights the dependence of proper beta-cell function on the coupling
   architecture that will be important for developing therapeutic
   treatments for diabetes such as islet transplantation techniques.
   Furthermore, this will be vital to gain a better understanding of the
   general features by which cellular interactions regulate coupled
   multicellular systems.}},

Abstract = {{Systematic asymptotic methods are applied to the compressible
   conservation and state equations for a reactive gas, including transport
   terms, to develop a rational thermomechanical formulation for the
   ignition of a chemical reaction following time-resolved, spatially
   distributed thermal energy addition from an external source into a
   finite volume of gas. A multi-parameter asymptotic analysis is developed
   for a wide range of energy deposition levels relative to the initial
   internal energy in the volume when the heating timescale is short
   compared to the characteristic acoustic timescale of the volume. Below a
   quantitatively defined threshold for energy addition, a nearly constant
   volume heating process occurs, with a small but finite internal gas
   expansion Mach number. Very little added thermal energy is converted to
   kinetic energy. The gas expelled from the boundary of the hot,
   high-pressure spot is the source of mechanical disturbances (acoustic
   and shock waves) that propagate away into the neighbouring unheated gas.
   When the energy addition reaches the threshold value, the heating
   process is fully compressible with a substantial internal gas expansion
   Mach number, the source of blast waves propagating into the unheated
   environmental gas. This case corresponds to an extremely large
   non-dimensional hot-spot temperature and pressure. If the former is
   sufficiently large, a high activation energy chemical reaction is
   initiated on the short heating timescale. This phenomenon is in contrast
   to that for more modest levels of energy addition, where a thermal
   explosion occurs only after the familiar extended ignition delay period
   for a classical high activation reaction. Transport effects, modulated
   by an asymptotically small Knudsen number, are shown to be negligible
   unless a local gradient in temperature, concentration or velocity is

Abstract = {{Dasymetric models increase the spatial resolution of population data by
   incorporating related ancillary data layers. The role of uncertainty in
   dasymetric modeling has not been fully addressed as of yet. Uncertainty
   is usually present because most population data are themselves
   uncertain, or the geographic processes that connect population and the
   ancillary data layers are not precisely known. A new dasymetric
   methodologythe penalized maximum entropy dasymetric model (P-MEDM)is
   presented that enables these sources of uncertainty to be represented
   and modeled. The P-MEDM propagates uncertainty through the model and
   yields fine-resolution population estimates with associated measures of
   uncertainty. This methodology contains a number of other benefits of
   theoretical and practical interest. In dasymetric modeling, researchers
   often struggle with identifying a relationship between population and
   ancillary data layers. The P-MEDM model simplifies this step by unifying
   how ancillary data are included. The P-MEDM also allows a rich array of
   data to be included, with disparate spatial resolutions, attribute
   resolutions, and uncertainties. Although the P-MEDM does not necessarily
   produce more precise estimates than do existing approaches, it does help
   to unify how data enter the dasymetric model, it increases the types of
   data that can be used, and it allows geographers to characterize the
   quality of their dasymetric estimates. We present an application of the
   P-MEDM that includes household-level survey data combined with higher
   spatial resolution data such as from census tracts, block groups, and
   land cover classifications.}},

Abstract = {{Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) clock stability is analyzed
   using a modified Allan deviation (MAD) for time intervals of 1 <= tau <=
   200 seconds. Active hydrogen masers are used as the receiver reference
   to effectively isolate the satellite clock contribution to the variance
   of the carrier phase from the various GNSS signals. Satellite clock
   stability for four different GNSS constellations are presented,
   highlighting the similarities and differences between the constellations
   as well as satellite blocks and clock types. The rubidium frequency
   standards (RFS) onboard the Global Positioning System (GPS) Block IIF,
   BeiDou, and Galileo satellites show improved short-term stability
   results in comparison to previous GPS blocks and GLONASS. The cesium
   frequency standards (CFS) on-board the GLONASS satellites are shown to
   have significantly higher MAD values in comparison to the other GNSS
   constellations, indicating the need for supplemental clock corrections
   for high-rate applications wishing to utilize the GLONASS signals.
   Sub-second Allan analysis is limited by the internal processing
   algorithms of the commercial receiver used in this study, but achievable
   with high enough signal-to-noise and a better understood software
   receiver.}},

   the Kalman filter with automatic dynamic noise propagation and smoothing

   the mismodeled dynamics. Complimentary algorithms that detect and
   reconstruct maneuvers from the information in the control policies are
   developed. A simulation in which these algorithms are applied to an
   astrodynamics tracking problem shows how this algorithm may be used to
   estimate a system's state, detect mismodeled dynamics, and reconstruct

Abstract = {{Numerical weather models (NWM) have become an important source of
   atmospheric data for modeling error sources in geodetic positioning. One
   example of this is the development of the Vienna Mapping Functions
   (VMF1) and ray-traced zenith delays which are derived from the European
   Centre for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) datasets. These
   products are provided on an operational basis through the GGOS
   Atmosphere project. In general, relatively little consideration has been
   given to the choice of NWM on the derived mapping functions and zenith
   delay products. In this investigation we compare the gridded-VMF1
   mapping functions and ray-traced zenith delays derived from the ECMWF to
   equivalent products derived by ray-tracing through the National Center
   for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Reanalysis model. We have chosen to
   compare the gridded version of these products as they are available for
   any location on Earth, rather than only specific stations and have been
   shown to be essentially equivalent in terms of accuracy. This paper also
   includes a discussion about a systematic production of gridded-VMF1 and
   ray-traced zenith delays derived from the NCEP datasets (and from the
   Canadian Meteorological Center GEM model) on an operational basis. The
   benefits of the service would include: (1) a backup in the event of the
   ECMWF VMF1 or zenith delays being unavailable; (2) greater compatibility
   with other NWM derived corrections, such as atmospheric pressure loading
   and; (3) the availability of tropospheric delay products derived from an
   independent source and ray-tracing algorithms should provide more
   robustness for combination products which use these models.}},

Abstract = {{As ocean current turbines move from the design stage into production and
   installation, a better understanding of oceanic turbulent flows and
   localized loading is required by researchers and members of industry.
   Consideration of realistic ocean turbulence environments, in particular,
   is essential for obtaining accurate and reliable predictions of ocean
   turbine lifetime and performance. In this study, large eddy simulations
   (LES) are used to model the turbulent boundary layer in which an ocean
   current turbine operates. The LES model captures current driving due to
   winds, waves, and tides, thereby providing a high degree of physical
   realism. Inflow and boundary conditions are designed to represent
   conditions during an observational campaign at Admiralty Head in Puget
   Sound, and comparisons are made between the LES results and available
   observational measurements. Further statistical measures of the LES flow
   fields are outlined, including vertical profiles of Reynolds stresses,
   turbine loading, and two point correlations. The ability of the
   synthetic turbulence generator TurbSim to reproduce realistic ocean
   turbulence is qualitatively assessed through comparisons with LES
   results. Finally, preliminary simulation results are presented for an
   ocean current turbine represented by an actuator disk.}},

   comparable gain and efficiency at higher frequencies while maintaining

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional second-order in time, fourth-order in space finite
   difference time-domain (FV24) algorithm is used in conjunction with the
   VSim electromagnetic (EM) simulation software package to completely
   model electrically large problems. FV24 has low numerical dispersion for
   electrically large EM problems with large grid sizes. Visualization of a
   160x160x160 EM simulation allows a deeper understanding of the complex
   electromagnetic phenomena in the example. Graphical processing units
   (GPUs) are used to execute the Compute Unified Device Architecture
   (CUDA) Fortran parallel implementation of the FV24 algorithm.
   Cutting-edge GPUs are evaluated for use with FV24 to reduce the
   algorithm's execution time.}},

Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates a MMIC GaN X-band PA designed to have improved
   efficiency by second harmonic power injection at the output that helps
   shape the time-domain waveforms across the drain. The MMIC contains a
   class-AB PA with a nominal 4-W (36 dBm) output power at 10GHz and a
   small-signal gain of 14 dB. The best results with harmonic injection
   were measured at 10.6 GHz with 3.5W (35.44 dBm) of output, showing an
   increase in drain efficiency from 48.5\% without injection to 70\% when
   26.2dBm was injected at 21.2 GHz. In order to maximize the total
   efficiency, which includes the efficiency of the injection circuit, a
   second harmonic efficient amplifier is integrated in the same GaN MMIC.
   The 20-GHz PA needs to provide a power on the order of P-out - 10dB, and
   is measured to output 27dBm with 8 dB gain and PAE=59\%. The
   relationship between the total efficiency and injector efficiency is
   derived and shows that the total efficiency is not appreciably affected
   by the injector efficiency if a second-harmonic amplifier with a gain
   greater than 6-7 dB and with a PAE > 40\% is employed.}},

Abstract = {{A number of small electronic devices benefit from micro-scale low
   temperature operation. Recently we have developed micro cryogenic
   coolers (MCCs) using a low-pressure, mixed-refrigerant Joule-Thomson
   cycle. The cryocoolers utilizes a MEMS-enabled gas compressor coupled to
   a micro cold stage. Two cold stages have been developed: one which uses
   a fiber-enabled heat exchanger assembled to a micro-machined throttling
   valve, and another which uses a MEMS-based heat exchanger. A
   microcompressor has been developed which uses MEMS-based check valves
   coupled to a membrane, which is actuated with a mechanically amplified
   piezoelectric amplifier. The compressor measures a volume 15 mL, can
   generate a pressure ratio of 6:1 and a maximum flow-rate of 60 standard
   mL/min. The complete cryocooler has reached low temperatures of 177 K,
   although temperature instability has been an issue, due to 2-phase flow
   through the micro-channels. This paper will cover the development and
   testing of the micro cryogenic cooler, as well as an analysis of the
   micro channel flow. A proper understanding of the micro-channel flow
   allows us to design refrigerant mixtures to improve the cooling power,
   and modify the cooler to eliminate temperature instabilities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the impact of roof covers on office building energy
   use for representative US climate zones. In particular, the study
   presented in the paper investigates the potential annual cooling energy
   use savings that roof covers could provide using whole-building
   simulation analysis to evaluate the performance of a 2-story office
   building in five US locations. Three parameters of the roof covers
   including their size, height, and transmittance, are considered in the
   analysis. The simulation results indicate that while roof covers had
   similar affects on buildings in all climate zones, their impact in
   reducing cooling energy usage is different and is more pronounced in
   cooler climates. Specifically, roof covers could potentially achieve
   cooling energy savings of up to: 25\% in Houston, 33\% in Atlanta, 31\%
   in Nashville, 38\% in Chicago, and 41\% in Madison. Based on the
   detailed simulation analysis results, a simplified calculation model is
   developed to help the estimation of cooling energy savings as a function
   of the roof cover size, height, and transmittance.}},

Abstract = {{This article is a feasibility analysis of using the batteries in Plug-in
   Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) for peak shaving. The analysis focuses
   on energy availability of the PHEV fleet as well as the financial
   savings to the utilities by analyzing different charging scenarios and
   circuitry.
   The energy availability and the financial savings are heavily dependent
   on the location and availability of charging stations. Three charging
   scenarios are analyzed: charging is possible at any time; cars can only
   be charged overnight; charging can be done overnight and twice during
   the day at the place of work for cars that are used for commuting.
   The major findings of the study are that charging only overnight will
   not provide sufficient energy when needed, but both other charging
   mechanisms can provide effective peak shaving. The charging anytime
   would require funding a large number of charging station, but charging
   overnight and at work could be accomplished with relative minor
   financial investments. The savings from peak shaving could be used for
   incentives to offset the extra cost of batteries in plug-in electric
   vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{Using a generalized form of Bloch's theorem, we derive the dispersion
   relation of a viscously damped locally resonant metamaterial modeled as
   an infinite mass-in-mass lumped parameter chain. For comparison, we
   obtain the dispersion relation for a statically equivalent
   Bragg-scattering mass-spring chain that is also viscously damped. For
   the two chains, we prescribe identical damping levels in the dashpots
   and compare the damping ratio associated with all propagating Bloch
   modes. We find that the locally resonant metamaterial exhibits higher
   dissipation throughout the spectrum which indicates a damping emergence
   phenomena due to the presence of local resonance. This phenomenon, which
   we define as metadamping, provides a new paradigm for the design of
   material systems that display both high damping and high stiffness. We
   conclude our investigation by quantifying the degree of metadamping as a
   function of the long-wave speed of sound in the medium or the static
   stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{An explicit integration algorithm for computations of wave propagation
   in solids is presented, which is designed to trace extensional and shear
   waves in accordance with their respective propagation speeds. This has
   been possible by an orthogonal decomposition of the total displacement
   into extensional and shear components. The two decoupled wave equations
   are integrated with a newly developed algorithm{[}1, 2] that is proven
   to be effective in mitigating spurious oscillations. The essence of the
   present algorithm consists of a combination of two wave capturing
   characteristics: a new integration formula that is designed to filter
   post-shock oscillations and the central difference method that is known
   to intrinsically filter out front-shock oscillations. A judicious
   combination of these two wave capturing characteristics is shown to
   reduce substantially both spurious front-shock and post-shock
   oscillations. Numerical experiments have demonstrated that the present
   algorithm traces the stress wave fronts with high-fidelity for both
   linear and nonlinear wave propagation problems.}},

Abstract = {{New Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites will bring
   common, interoperable GNSS signals on L1. These new signals, L1C Global
   Positioning System (GPS)/Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) L1C and
   Galileo E1 Open Service (OS), promise performance improvements in many
   areas. One key area is that these signals, which use binary offset
   carrier (BOC) and multiplexed BOC (MBOC), will provide better multipath
   performance over the binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) GPS L1 C/A. This
   paper evaluates the benefit of difference using on-air measurements of
   these signals. The evaluation will utilize signals from to-be
   operational Galileo and QZSS satellites. The assessment conducts BPSK
   and BOC processing using signals from the same satellite to eliminate

Abstract = {{Undesired noise and vibrations have a detrimental effect in many areas.
   Hence the control of vibrations has become a relevant technological
   challenge. Active vibration control of structures using smart materials
   especially is in vogue. It involves sensing the motion of the structure
   using sensors, generating a control signal using a controller and
   applying a control force on the structure using actuators. To design the
   control system of any vibrating structure, the mathematical model of the
   system is required. However, it is not possible, to theoretically
   construct the model of complex structures. On the other hand, it is
   relatively simpler to model such systems in an Finite Element (FE)
   environment like ANSYS (c). This paper deals with the extraction of the
   mathematical model of a cantilever beam from its FEA model. This
   procedure of extraction is applicable to any mechanical system under
   dynamics study. Then again, the matrices thus formed are usually very
   large and require a lot of computational time to process. Hence an
   attempt is made to construct the reduced model of the system which
   approximates the actual model to the desired extent. In this paper, the
   full model of the beam is reduced by discarding those modes which do not
   contribute to the overall response on the basis of their dc gains in
   MATLAB (c). It is found that the frequency and transient responses of
   the full and reduced models match closely. Hence the reduced model may
   be used to represent the system instead of the full model with
   reasonable accuracy. Design of controller is attempted using the theory
   of state and output feedback control laws. The controller is modeled by
   calculating the optimal control gain by formulating an algorithm to
   solve the equations involved. The transient and frequency responses of
   the controlled full model and reduced models are then plotted. The
   procedure for designing controller described in this paper may be
   extended to any real world system.}},

Abstract = {{Bayesian decentralized data fusion (DDF) is challenging to implement for
   problems modeled by arbitrarily complex non-Gaussian pdfs, especially
   those with hierarchical or hybrid uncertainties. Furthermore, in ad hoc
   communication topologies, `umor-robust' fusion approximations for
   handling unknown dependencies are often too conservative and lossy. This
   work exploits novel insights about Bayesian DDF to address these issues.
   Firstly, it is shown that DDF naturally factorizes into
   semi-parallelizable conditional DDF updates, which leads to an efficient
   and generalizable hierarchical Bayesian partial information-sharing
   scheme for multi-agent networks. Secondly, it is shown that conditional
   factorizations can significantly extend the capabilities of conservative
   weighted exponential product (WEP) DDF approximations for ad hoc
   networks, enabling convex information-theoretical optimization of
   implicit conditional common information factors. Simulation results for
   a multi-robot target search mission show that the proposed methods lead
   to significant improvements in computation time and information gain
   over traditional monolithic DDF techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Municipal buildings are an essential component of daily life. Without
   schools, hospitals and other public buildings, society and economy could
   not function. Therefore a failure to consider the potential impact of
   climate change on municipal buildings would be both costly and
   detrimental to sustainable development. In this paper the authors
   present research undertaken to ascertain the potential impacts of
   climate impacts on municipal buildings in South Africa. A two-phase
   approach was adopted. Firstly the appropriate climate effects on a given
   building inventory, in a selected location, were determined; then the
   cost impacts on that building (based on a set of stressor-response
   functions) were applied. The results of the study predict that the total
   impact of climate change on buildings in South Africa could vary between
   USD \$42.7 million average annual costs in the median scenario and USD
   \$214.3 million average annual costs in the maximum scenario. The
   results presented are all incurred costs, which need to be addressed to
   avoid health and safety issues. However costs would be much higher if
   the existing stock was augmented without considering climate change
   impacts. The research provides an understanding of the cost of climate
   change and how the maintenance and adaptation of the unsustainable
   buildings may divert resources from sustainable development. The results
   of the research may also present an opportunity for existing buildings
   to be retrofitted with alternative, sustainable technologies, which
   serve to decrease vulnerability to climate change impacts going forward.

Abstract = {{The fundamental tenets of a human-rated space system are to accommodate
   the needs of the crew, effectively utilize their capabilities to
   accomplish the mission objectives, and protect the crewmembers, as well
   as ground teams and the uninvolved public, from hazardous events. The
   concept of human-rating (previously referred to as man-rating) was
   originally primarily aimed at improving the reliability of launch
   vehicles for human use and increasing safety through the addition of
   escape/abort systems. The earliest use of this term found in the
   aerospace literature was in reference to the X-series experimental
   rocket planes. Later sources began including `human in the loop' design
   aspects driven by ergonomics and human factors, which essentially
   extended the application to explicitly address crew utilization.
   Accommodating basic human needs in the hostile environment of space is
   primarily achieved by incorporation of a life support system. Beyond
   this basic provision, however, human factors and related medical
   considerations can also be used to improve overall health and
   performance of the crew. Throughout the years, the human-rating process
   itself evolved from providing general guidelines to being mandated as a
   set of prescribed requirements. Considered collectively, the ultimate
   goal is to help ensure safety and mission success through proper space
   system design and operations. This paper provides a brief historical
   overview of human-rating and considerations for its implementation
   throughout all phases of spacecraft design and operations.}},

Abstract = {{The Relativistic Electron and Proton Telescope Integrated Little
   Experiment (REPTile) is a loaded-disc collimated solid-state particle
   telescope designed, built, tested, and operated by a team of students at
   the University of Colorado. It was launched onboard the Colorado Student
   Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE), a 3U CubeSat, from Vandenberg Air
   Force Base on September 13th, 2012, as part of NASA's Educational Launch
   of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) program.
   REPTile takes measurements of energetic particles in the near-Earth
   environment. These measurements, by themselves and in conjunction with
   larger missions, are critical to understand, model, and predict
   hazardous space weather effects. However, miniaturizing a power-and
   mass-hungry particle telescope to return clean measurements from a
   CubeSat platform is extremely challenging. To overcome these challenges,
   REPTile underwent a rigorous design and testing phase. This paper
   highlights some of the design and testing which validates the data as a
   valuable contribution to the study of space weather.
   CSSWE uses a keep-it-simple design approach to minimize risks associated
   with low budget and student built missions. A coherent testing plan
   confirmed that the spacecraft would remain healthy and take reliable
   measurements in orbit. This paper also highlights the system-level
   design and testing that verified spacecraft performance pre and post
   launch.
   Despite the risks inherent CubeSat missions, REPTile to date has
   returned over 300 days of valuable science data, more than tripling its
   nominal mission lifetime of 90 days. Initial in-flight instrument
   results are presented, including engineering hurdles encountered in
   receiving and processing the data. Also, the preliminary scientific
   contributions of the mission are covered in this paper to demonstrate
   the capabilities of a low-budget CubeSat mission. As an affordable,
   robust, and simple instrument and mission design, CSSWE demonstrates
   that small satellites are a reliable platform to deliver quality
   science.}},

Abstract = {{GPS has become the instrument standard for positioning and timing
   onboard many low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites. The Neutron star Interior
   Composition ExploreR (NICER) is a soft X-ray timing spectrometer payload
   for the International Space Station (ISS) that will meet its timing
   requirements through a combination of microcontroller oscillators and a
   GPS disciplined one pulse per second (1-PPS) signal. This paper presents
   an analysis of the expected pseudorange and time solution errors caused
   by multipath in the complex ISS environment. The specific timing
   requirement and the many challenges presented by the NICER environment
   make this particular interesting case study for analysis using an
   Advanced GNSS Multipath Model (AGMM). The AGMM incorporates CAD drawings
   of the structures involved, and accounts for dynamic motion of the solar
   panels and radiators on the ISS, as well as the articulation of the
   NICER payload. Simulations show the impact of blockages, reflections and
   diffraction from a number of key surfaces on the ISS. Example results
   indicate that clock bias solution errors caused by multipath are well
   below 10 ns most of the time, with some errors in the 10-20 ns range
   when large multipath and poor GPS satellite visibility occur together.
   The simulation tool developed for this study has the flexibility to
   support similar analyses for a variety of spaceborne GNSS applications.}},

Abstract = {{The Simons Array is an expansion of the POLARBEAR cosmic microwave
   background (CMB) polarization experiment currently observing from the
   Atacama Desert in Northern Chile. This expansion will create an array of
   three 3.5 m telescopes each coupled to a multichroic bolometric
   receiver. The Simons Array will have the sensitivity to produce a > 5
   sigma detection of inflationary gravitational waves with a
   tensor-to-scalar ratio r > 0.01, detect the known minimum 58 meV sum of
   the neutrino masses with 3 sigma confidence when combined with a
   next-generation baryon acoustic oscillation measurement, and make a
   lensing map of large-scale structure over the 80\% of the sky available
   from its Chilean site. These goals require high sensitivity and the
   ability to extract the CMB signal from contaminating astrophysical
   foregrounds; these requirements are met by coupling the three
   high-throughput telescopes to novel multichroic lenslet-coupled pixels
   each measuring CMB photons in both linear polarization states over
   multiple spectral bands. We present the status of this instrument
   already under construction, and an analysis of its capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{POLARBEAR-2 is a next-generation receiver for precision measurements of
   the polarization of the cosmic microwave background (Cosmic Microwave
   Background (CMB)). Scheduled to deploy in early 2015, it will observe
   alongside the existing POLARBEAR-1 receiver, on a new telescope in the
   Simons Arrayon Cerro Toco in the Atacama desert of Chile. For increased
   sensitivity, it will feature a larger area focal plane, with a total of
   7,588 polarization sensitive antenna-coupled Transition Edge Sensor
   (TES) bolometers, with a design sensitivity of 4.1 The focal plane will
   be cooled to 250 milliKelvin, and the bolometers will be read-out with
   40x frequency domain multiplexing, with 36 optical bolometers on a
   single SQUID amplifier, along with 2 dark bolometers and 2 calibration
   resistors. To increase the multiplexing factor from 8x for POLARBEAR-1
   to 40x for POLARBEAR-2 requires additional bandwidth for SQUID readout
   and well-defined frequency channel spacing. Extending to these higher
   frequencies requires new components and design for the LC filters which
   define channel spacing. The LC filters are cold resonant circuits with
   an inductor and capacitor in series with each bolometer, and stray
   inductance in the wiring and equivalent series resistance from the
   capacitors can affect bolometer operation. We present results from
   characterizing these new readout components. Integration of the readout
   system is being done first on a small scale, to ensure that the readout
   system does not affect bolometer sensitivity or stability, and to
   validate the overall system before expansion into the full receiver. We
   present the status of readout integration, and the initial results and
   status of components for the full array.}},

Abstract = {{POLARBEAR-2 (PB-2) is a cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization
   experiment for B-mode detection. The PB-2 receiver has a large focal
   plane and aperture that consists of 7588 transition edge sensor (TES)
   bolometers at 250 mK. The receiver consists of the optical cryostat
   housing reimaging lenses and infrared filters, and the detector cryostat
   housing TES bolometers. The large focal plane places substantial
   requirements on the thermal design of the optical elements at the 4K,
   50K, and 300K stages. Infrared filters and lenses inside the optical
   cryostat are made of alumina for this purpose. We measure basic
   properties of alumina, such as the index of refraction, loss tangent and
   thermal conductivity. All results meet our requirements. We also
   optically characterize filters and lenses made of alumina. Finally, we
   perform a cooling test of the entire optical cryostat. All measured
   temperature values satisfy our requirements. In particular, the
   temperature rise between the center and edge of the alumina infrared
   filter at 50 K is only 2.0 +/- 1.4 K. Based on the measurements, we
   estimate the incident power to each thermal stage.}},

Title = {{Monitoring Ice Accumulation and Active De-icing Control of Wind Turbine
   Blades}},
Booktitle = {{WIND TURBINE CONTROL AND MONITORING}},
Series = {{Advances in Industrial Control}},
Year = {{2014}},
Pages = {{193-230}},
Abstract = {{Ice accumulation on wind turbines operating in cold regions reduces
   power generation by degrading aerodynamic efficiency and causes mass
   imbalance and fatigue loads on the blades. Due to blade rotation and
   variation of the pitch angle, different locations on the blade
   experience large variation of Reynolds number, Nusselt number, heat
   loss, and nonuniform ice distribution. Hence, applying different amounts
   of heat flux in different blade locations can provide more effective
   de-icing for the same total power consumption. This large variation of
   required heat flux highly motivates using distributed resistive heating
   with the capability of locally adjusting thermal power as a function of
   location on the blade. Under medium/severe icing conditions, active
   de-icing with accurate direct ice detection is more energy efficient and
   effective in keeping the blade ice-free. This chapter includes: (1) A
   literature study on different methods of ice detection and a review on
   passive and active anti/de-icing techniques on wind turbines, (2)
   Development of an optical ice sensing method for direct detection of ice
   on the blade, including experimental results, (3) Development of an
   aero/thermodynamic model, which predicts how much heat flux is needed
   locally for de-icing under variable atmospheric conditions, (4)
   Experimental results showing a proof of concept of closed-loop de-icing
   using distributed optical ice sensing and resistive heating, and (5)
   Numerical modeling of ice melting on a blade for different distributed
   heater layouts and geometries in order to optimize thermal actuation
   strategy, improve de-icing efficiency, and reduce power consumption. We
   conclude with discussions of future directions on distributed ice
   sensing and thermal actuation for the next generation of de-icing
   systems on wind turbines.}},

   This class of channels called strong in partial order channels,
   generalizes the notion of strong channels introduced earlier in the
   literature in the context of SISO and SIMO Gaussian interference
   channels. The class of strong in partial order channels, although have
   an overlap with the class of aligned-strong ICs introduced by Shang et.
   al., also contain channels which are not aligned-strong. Further, it is
   proved that using independent and random Gaussian codes at the
   transmitters and decoding both users messages at the receivers are
   sufficient to achieve the capacity region on this class of channels.
   This result enlarges the set of channels for which exact capacity of the

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing of unconventional gas wells utilizes large volumes
   of water-based fluid to increase formation permeability and, as a
   result, generates large amounts of wastewater as flowback. This water
   requires suitable treatment before being reused or discharged into the
   environment. A principal ingredient of flowback water is guar gum (a
   gelling agent), which may adversely affect advanced flowback water
   treatment such as membrane separation. This study demonstrates the
   potential of an activated sludge mixed liquor to degrade guar under
   typical flowback conditions {[}i.e., high concentrations of total
   dissolved solids (TDS)]. Guar was efficiently degraded at a TDS
   concentration of 1500 mg/L, with more than 90\% of the dissolved
   chemical oxygen demand (CODd) having been removed after 10 h. Increasing
   the TDS concentration to 45000 mg/L inhibited CODd degradation to 60\%
   removal after 31 h. A high TDS concentration additionally resulted in an
   increased effluent level of total suspended solids and turbidity;
   however, these were efficiently reduced using ferric chloride
   coagulation followed by sedimentation and filtration. Biological
   reduction of the guar concentration increased the flux of a bench-scale
   ultrafiltration membrane, demonstrating the potential of the process to
   treat flowback water prior to membrane separation.}},

Abstract = {{A myoelectric controller should provide an intuitive and effective
   human-machine interface that deciphers user intent in real-time and is
   robust enough to operate in daily life. Many myoelectric control
   architectures have been developed, Including pattern recognition
   systems, finite state machines, and more recently, postural control
   schemes. Here, we present a comparative study of two types of finite
   state machines and a postural control scheme using both virtual and
   physical assessment procedures with seven nondisabled subjects. The
   Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP) was used in order to
   compare the effectiveness of the controllers during activities of daily
   living using a multigrasp artificial hand. Also, a virtual hand posture
   matching task was used to compare the controllers when reproducing six
   target postures. The performance when using the postural control scheme
   was significantly better (p < 0.05) than when using the finite state
   machines during the physical assessment when comparing within-subject
   averages using the SHAP percent difference metric. The virtual
   assessment results described significantly greater completion rates
   (97\% and 99\%) for the finite state machines, but the movement time
   tended to be faster (2.7 s) for the postural control scheme. Our results
   substantiate that postural control schemes rival other state-of-the-art
   myoelectric controllers.}},

   allows using the resulting models for planning in configuration space of

   with a complex loading sequence and the growth of inelastic zone with
   time. This paper proposes a technique to determine the critical slip
   surface as well as to calculate the factor of safety for shallow failure
   on partially saturated soil slope. Based on the effective stress field
   in finite element analysis, stresses are estimated at each Gaussian
   point of elements and improved search strategy is proposed for a
   noncircular critical surface, and then the slope stability analysis
   focuses on surficial failure during water infiltration through porous
   deformable media. The change of unit weight by seepage force has an
   effect on the horizontal and vertical displacements on the soil slope.
   The Drucker-Prager failure criterion was adopted for stress-strain
   relation to calculate coupling hydraulic and mechanical behavior of the
   partially saturated soil slope.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on a new experimental approach to characterize the
   thermal volume change of unsaturated soils under different stress
   states. Specifically, a thermal triaxial cell was constructed with
   suction control using the axis translation technique, saturation control
   using a flow pump, cell pressure control using a high pressure flow
   pump, and a metal cell to permit application of net mean stresses up to
   10 MPa. The cell was constructed to measure the thermal volume change of
   unsaturated soils under high degrees of saturation (continuous water
   phase) while precisely tracking the total soil volume and pore water
   outflow/inflow volumes, in addition to measuring the impacts of suction
   and temperature on preconsolidation stress. The thermal triaxial cell is
   also capable of applying anisotropic stress states, with the axial
   stress controlled using a pneumatic Bellofram piston. This paper
   presents the thermo-mechanical calibration data along with the results
   from a test on an unsaturated silt specimen. The thermal volume change
   of the specimen up to a temperature of 40 degrees C was consistent with
   results from the literature for normally consolidated conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A turbine-mounted lidar can measure wind speed ahead of a wind turbine,
   and this preview measurement can be used to improve turbine control
   performance by reducing structural loads and/or increasing power
   capture. Effective lidar-based control requires not only an accurate
   wind speed measurement, but also knowledge of the expected arrival time
   of the measured wind. Arrival time is the time it takes for the wind to
   travel from the measurement focus location to the turbine rotor.
   Typically, arrival time is assumed to be equal to the distance traveled
   divided by the average wind speed. Field test data show that this
   assumption can be improved on average through an induction zone
   correction. In addition, arrival time can temporarily deviate
   significantly above or below this average value. If we can anticipate
   how arrival time will change, we can improve control performance. In
   this study, we post-process turbine and lidar data to show how arrival
   time varies and to determine an upper limit on possible improvement as a
   result of accurately predicting arrival time. Results show that this
   upper limit is a 26\% average increase in coherence bandwidth between
   the measured wind and the wind that arrives at the rotor. In above-rated
   wind speeds, for example, this corresponds to a 21\% improvement in the
   performance cost reduction due to incorporating lidar into a blade pitch
   controller, where the performance cost is a combined measure of
   generator speed error and blade pitch actuation.}},

Abstract = {{Log-linear learning and its variants have received significant attention
   in recent literature on networked control systems. In potential games,
   log-linear learning guarantees that agents' behavior will converge to
   the potential function maximizer. The appeal of log-linear learning for
   distributed control stems from the fact that distributed engineering
   systems can often be modeled as potential games where the potential
   function maximizers correspond to the optimal system behavior. In this
   paper we seek to characterize the mixing times for log-linear learning.
   For a specific class of potential games, called semi-anonymous potential
   games, previous results have shown that a mild variant of log-linear
   learning guarantees convergence to the set of potential function
   maximizers in time that is linear in the number of players. In this
   paper, we show that such convergence guarantees continue to hold even in
   the setting where players enter and exit the game.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of estimator that incorporates optimal control and outputs a
   control policy is developed and analyzed in this study. The estimator is
   developed in a similar manner to a Kalman Algorithm with an almost
   identical form, but has additional properties for more accurate
   tracking, maneuver detection, and maneuver reconstruction. Unlike the
   Kalman Algorithm, this estimator frees up the initial state, which
   results in an algorithm that decouples a priori state uncertainty and
   dynamics uncertainty. The dynamic uncertainty inflates the state
   covariance in an automatic fashion that prevents filter saturation. The
   algorithm also outputs control estimates that may be used to both
   identify the presence of mismodeled dynamics and quantify those
   mismodeled dynamics. An example application demonstrates the maneuver
   detection and reconstruction properties of this estimator in an orbit
   determination problem where the dynamics are mismodeled.}},

Abstract = {{Small solar system bodies such as asteroids and comets are of
   significant interest for scientific, robotic, and human exploration
   missions. However, their dynamical environments are among the most
   extreme found in the solar system. Uncontrolled orbital trajectories in
   the vicinity of an asteroid are highly unstable in general and may
   either impact or escape in timespans of hours to days. Even with active
   control, the chaotic nature of motion about these bodies can effectively
   randomize a trajectory within a short time period, creating fundamental
   difficulties for the navigation of spacecraft in these environments.
   Dealing with these navigation issues through the estimation and control
   of asteroid-relative motion and models is a burgeoning area of research
   that has become higher profile with the recently announced NASA Asteroid
   Retrieval Mission. The goals of that mission will require significant
   extensions of capability beyond previously flown asteroid rendezvous
   missions. Despite this, there has been significant prior research and
   application of estimation and control techniques for spacecraft in these
   small body environments that can directly inform and motivate the
   necessary direction of future research. This tutorial paper will review
   previous research and applications for asteroid relative proximity
   operations and indicate areas where additional future research is
   needed.}},

Abstract = {{Unconventional oil and natural gas extraction enabled by horizontal
   drilling and hydraulic fracturing (fracking) is driving an economic
   boom, with consequences described from ``revolutionary{''} to

   energy generates income and, done well, can reduce air pollution and
   even water use compared with other fossil fuels. Alternatively, it could
   slow the adoption of renewables and, done poorly, release toxic
   chemicals into water and air. Primary threats to water resources include
   surface spills, wastewater disposal, and drinking-water contamination
   through poor well integrity. An increase in volatile organic compounds
   and air toxics locally are potential health threats, but the switch from
   coal to natural gas for electricity generation will reduce sulfur,
   nitrogen, mercury, and particulate air pollution. Data gaps are
   particularly evident for human health studies, for the question of
   whether natural gas will displace coal compared with renewables, and for
   decadal-scale legacy issues of well leakage and plugging and abandonment
   practices. Critical topics for future research}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical reduction and oxidation of PEDOT:PSS are used to
   modulate the channel current in organic electrochemical transistors
   (OECTs). In addition to changing PEDOT conductivity over more than 4
   orders of magnitude, these redox reactions cause a shift in the
   PEDOT:PSS absorption spectrum. In this work we have used this shift in
   the absorption spectrum to make spatially and temporally resolved
   measurements of the redox state of PEDOT:PSS. By applying these
   measurements to the PEDOT:PSS in an OECT channel, we have shown that the
   redox state of the PEDOT:PSS is not constant along the channel during
   transistor operation. Furthermore, we have shown that the time constant
   of the optical transition is significantly larger near the transistor
   source than it is near the transistor drain. These results are not
   considered in existing models of the OECT transient response, and they
   may lead to a better understanding of geometry-performance relationships
   in OECTs.}},

   chloride extraction from concrete and nanoparticle injection into
   existing reinforced concrete structures by means of electromigration
   technique. Concrete specimens are exposed to accelerated chloride
   penetration tests in order to simulate a natural chloride exposure. The
   developed chloride profile is removed by electroextraction by reversing
   the polarity in the testing chamber. In a similar manner, concrete
   specimens are injected with different concentrations of colloidal
   nanosilica particles. It was shown in the paper that chlorides can be
   effectively extracted from the concrete using small voltage lasting for
   several days. Higher concentration solutions of nanosilica can also be
   effectively transported into concrete via the electric field. Once
   injected nanosilica can act as microstructure densifier and further
   reduce chloride penetration as demonstrated by decreased diffusivity of
   the treated concrete.}},

   the photophotopolymer, rapid on-demand printing of arbitrary

Abstract = {{High-quality computer simulations are required when designing floating
   wind turbines because of the complex dynamic responses that are inherent
   with a high number of degrees of freedom and variable metocean
   conditions. In 2007, the FAST wind turbine simulation tool, developed
   and maintained by the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE's) National
   Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), was expanded to include capabilities
   that are suitable for modeling floating offshore wind turbines. In an
   effort to validate FAST and other offshore wind energy modeling tools,
   DOE funded the DeepCwind project that tested three prototype floating
   wind turbines at 1/50th scale in a wave basin, including a
   semisubmersible, a tension-leg platform, and a spar buoy. This paper
   describes the use of the results of the spar wave basin tests to
   calibrate and validate the FAST offshore floating simulation tool, and
   presents some initial results of simulated dynamic responses of the spar
   to several combinations of wind and sea states. Wave basin tests with
   the spar attached to a scale model of the NREL 5-megawatt reference wind
   turbine were performed at the Maritime Research Institute Netherlands
   under the DeepCwind project. This project included free-decay tests,
   tests with steady or turbulent wind and still water (both periodic and
   irregular waves with no wind), and combined wind/wave tests. The
   resulting data from the 1/50th model was scaled using Froude scaling to
   full size and used to calibrate and validate a full-size simulated model
   in FAST. Results of the model calibration and validation include
   successes, subtleties, and limitations of both wave basin testing and
   FAST modeling capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the lack of high-power sources along with strong electromagnetic
   absorption by water vapor at frequencies between similar to 100 GHz and
   similar to 10 THz, there are very few radar systems, or any other
   systems for that matter, operating in this region of the spectrum. For
   this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the terahertz gap. Source
   technology, however, is improving, thus facilitating radar systems
   operating in this new frontier of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the
   lower end of this spectral region near the millimeter/submillimeter
   transition, components are more readily available and atmospheric
   attenuation is moderate in comparison to higher frequencies. Utilizing
   components that can generate on the order of 50 mW of power, a real
   aperture radar for imaging surfaces up to several hundred meters has
   been developed. Transmitting a vertically oriented fan beam to scan the
   Field of View (FOV) in azimuth and receiving at two vertically,
   displaced locations with identical fan beams forming an interferometer,
   three dimensional images of the surface topography (in range, azimuth
   and height) can be generated. This paper describes the design of the
   prototype system and presents initial results, expanding on prior work

Abstract = {{This paper presents analysis and design of a reconfigurable switched
   capacitor (SC) step-down DC-DC converter architecture suitable for
   on-chip integrated portable power supplies. Comprising basic SC cells,
   the proposed DC-DC converter is modular in architecture, and can be
   viewed as a dual of the multiphase buck converter architecture. The SC
   converter with integrated capacitors is designed in a standard 180 nm
   CMOS process to operate in 113 and 112 conversion ratio modes. The
   converter is designed to operate with input voltage varying from 2.7V to
   5.5V, and switching frequency varying from 10 MHz to 70 MHz, while
   delivering up to 250mA load current at 1.3V output voltage. SPICE
   simulation results based on detailed process models are presented. It is
   shown that efficiency is significantly higher than in a linear regulator
   operating over the complete specified input voltage range, and also
   reduces the off-chip input and output filter capacitor requirement.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a modular converter system to achieve high power
   density, high system bandwidth and scalability for isolated
   bidirectional DC/AC and AC/DC threephase power conversion. The approach
   is based on high frequency isolated series resonant converter (SRC)
   modules with series output connection and a low frequency three-phase
   unfolder. The performance objectives are realized through elimination of
   traditional low frequency passive filters used in PWM inverters and
   instead require high control bandwidth in the SRC modules to achieve
   high quality AC waveforms. The system operation and performance are
   verified with simulation and experimental results for a I kW prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Substring level differential power processing (DPP) in photovoltaic (PV)
   power systems is used to mitigate power loss due to mismatches in PV
   strings. This paper presents the design and implementation of a
   controller chip in a 0.18 mu m CMOS process for a submodule integrated
   converter (subMIC) in the isolated-port DPP architecture. The presented
   controller design combines linear and non-linear PWM control for the
   subMIC MOSFETs while requiring only a few external components. Other
   features such as power limiting and system disable are included to
   improve converter and system efficiency. The controller opens the
   possibilities to minimize the converter footprint, reduce power
   consumption, and potentially reduce the cost. Experimental results are
   presented for a 72-cell PV module with three subMICs using the
   controller chip, demonstrating greater than 99\% module-level efficiency
   at up to 50\% mismatch.}},

Abstract = {{Future radio occultation (RO) receivers are planned to utilize the newly
   implemented Global Positioning System (GPS) L5 band centered at 1176.45
   MHz. Since there are currently no operational GPS L5 receivers used for
   space-based RO applications, the interference environment is unclear.
   Distance measuring equipment (DME) and tactical air navigation (TACAN)
   stations share the same frequency band as GPS L5. The signals from these
   stations have been identified as possible sources of interference for
   any GPS L5 receiver, including those used in RO applications. This study
   utilizes Systems Tools Kit (STK) simulations to gain insight into the
   power received by a RO satellite in low Earth orbit (LEO) from a
   DME-TACAN transmission as well as the amount of interfering stations. In
   order to confirm the validity of utilizing STK for communication
   purposes, a theoretical scenario was recreated as a simulation and the
   results were confirmed. Once the method was validated, STK was used to
   output a received power level aboard a RO satellite from a DME-TACAN
   station as well as a tool to detail the number of interfering DME-TACAN
   stations witnessed by a space-based RO receiver over time. The results
   indicated a large number of DME-TACAN stations transmitting at similar
   orientations as a receiving RO satellite, thereby leading to the
   possibility of signal degradation in an unclear interference
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Local patch-based models have been shown to be effective in numerous
   image processing applications and have become the core of the
   state-of-the-art denoising, inpainting and structural editing
   algorithms. Most such modeling approaches mainly rely on searching for
   similar patches in the set of available patches. However, the apparent
   similarity between sufficiently small (e.g., 5 x 5 pixels) image regions
   motivates modeling them with a low-dimensional manifold instead and
   suggests the existence of a simple parametrization for it. Although
   there exist manifold models for a single patch, it has remained an open
   problem how to efficiently represent an entire image in terms of its
   overlapping patches drawn from the underlying non-linear manifold. We
   propose to consider an image to lie on the intersection of separate
   manifolds corresponding to different overlapping patches, which we
   approximate with affine subspaces in a kernel-induced feature space. In
   contrast to our previous work on this topic, here we solve the
   intersection and preimage problems simultaneously, ensuring the
   existence of a suitable solution in the input space. This significantly
   improves the performance and robustness of our method. Our method
   incorporates any desired equality constraints on the image, and thus can
   be used to regularize any linear inverse problem with the manifold
   intersection model. Our experimental results show nearly perfect
   compressive sensing reconstruction of images whose patches are well
   described by a manifold model, as well as exceptional performance in
   denoising and inpainting.}},

Abstract = {{Our objective is to map dynamic provinces and investigate dynamic
   changes in Jakobshavn Isbrae, Greenland. We use an approach that
   combines structural glaciology and remote-sensing data analysis,
   facilitated by mathematical characterization of generalized spatial
   surface roughness that provides parameters related to ice dynamics,
   deformation and interaction of the ice with bed topography. The approach
   is applied to derive time series of elevation and roughness changes and
   to attribute changes during rapid retreat. Different dynamic types of
   fast- and slow-moving ice can be mapped from ICESat Geoscience Laser
   Altimeter System data (2003-09) and Airborne Topographic Mapper data,
   using spatial roughness characterization, validated with ASTER and
   bed-topographic data. Results of comparative analysis of elevation
   changes and roughness changes of Jakobshavn south ice stream indicate
   (1) surface lowering of 10-15 m a(-1) between 2004 and 2009 and (2) no
   change in surface roughness and dynamic types. These findings are
   consistent with a front retreat as part of a fjord-glacier cycle or
   following warming of fjord water and with climatic warming, but not with
   an internal dynamic acceleration as a cause of the observed changes
   during rapid retreat. Relationships to changes in basal water pressure
   are discussed. All glaciodynamic changes appear to have initiated near
   the front and propagated up-glacier.}},

Abstract = {{While silicon nanostructures are extensively used in electronics, the
   indirect bandgap of silicon poses challenges for optoelectronic
   applications like photovoltaics and light emitting diodes (LEDs). Here,
   we show that size-dependent pseudo-direct bandgap transitions in silicon
   nanocrystals dominate the interactions between (photoexcited) charge
   carriers and phonons, and hence the optoelectronic properties of silicon
   nanocrystals. Direct measurements of the electronic density of states
   (DOS) for different sized silicon nanocrystals reveal that these
   pseudo-direct transitions, likely arising from the nanocrystal surface,
   can couple with the quantum-confined silicon states. Moreover, we
   demonstrate that since these transitions determine the interactions of
   charge carriers with phonons, they change the light emission,
   absorption, charge carrier diffusion and phonon drag (Seebeck
   coefficient) in nanoscaled silicon semiconductors. Therefore, these
   results can have important implications for the design of
   optoelectronics and thermoelectric devices based on nanostructured
   silicon.}},

Abstract = {{Copper metal can provide an important alternative for the development of
   efficient, low-cost and low-loss plasmonic nanoparticles, and selective
   nanocatalysts. However, poor chemical stability and lack of insight into
   photophysics and plasmon decay mechanisms has impeded study. Here, we
   use smooth conformal ALD coating on copper nanoparticles to prevent
   surface oxidation, and study dephasing time for localized surface
   plasmons on different sized copper nanoparticles. Using dephasing time
   as a figure of merit, we elucidate the role of electron-electron,
   electron-phonon, impurity, surface and grain boundary scattering on the
   decay of localized surface plasmon waves. Using our quantitative
   analysis and different temperature dependent measurements, we show that
   electron-phonon interactions dominate over other scattering mechanisms
   in dephasing plasmon waves. While interband transitions in copper metal
   contributes substantially to plasmon losses, tuning surface plasmon
   modes to infrared frequencies leads to a five-fold enhancement in the
   quality factor. These findings demonstrate that conformal ALD coatings
   can improve the chemical stability for copper nanoparticles, even at
   high temperatures (>300 degrees C) in ambient atmosphere, and nanoscaled
   copper is a good alternative material for many potential applications in
   nanophotonics, plasmonics, catalysis and nanoscale electronics.}},

Title = {{The next generation of low-cost personal air quality sensors for

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{3325-3336}},
Abstract = {{Advances in embedded systems and low-cost gas sensors are enabling a new
   wave of low-cost air quality monitoring tools. Our team has been engaged
   in the development of low-cost, wearable, air quality monitors (M-Pods)
   using the Arduino platform. These M-Pods house two types of sensors -
   commercially available metal oxide semiconductor (MOx) sensors used to
   measure CO, O-3, NO2, and total VOCs, and NDIR sensors used to measure
   CO2. The MOx sensors are low in cost and show high sensitivity near
   ambient levels; however they display non-linear output signals and have
   cross-sensitivity effects. Thus, a quantification system was developed
   to convert the MOx sensor signals into concentrations.
   We conducted two types of validation studies - first, deployments at a
   regulatory monitoring station in Denver, Colorado, and second, a user
   study. In the two deployments (at the regulatory monitoring station),
   M-Pod concentrations were determined using collocation calibrations and
   laboratory calibration techniques. M-Pods were placed near regulatory
   monitors to derive calibration function coefficients using the
   regulatory monitors as the standard. The form of the calibration
   function was derived based on laboratory experiments. We discuss various
   techniques used to estimate measurement uncertainties.
   The deployments revealed that collocation calibrations provide more
   accurate concentration estimates than laboratory calibrations. During
   collocation calibrations, median standard errors ranged between 4.0-6.1
   ppb for O-3, 6.48.4 ppb for NO2, 0.28-0.44 ppm for CO, and 16.8 ppm for
   CO2. Median signal to noise (S / N) ratios for the M-Pod sensors were
   higher than the regulatory instruments: for NO2, 3.6 compared to 23.4;
   for O-3, 1.4 compared to 1.6; for CO, 1.1 compared to 10.0; and for CO2,
   42.2 compared to 300-500. By contrast, lab calibrations added bias and
   made it difficult to cover the necessary range of environmental
   conditions to obtain a good calibration.
   A separate user study was also conducted to assess uncertainty estimates
   and sensor variability. In this study, 9 M-Pods were calibrated via
   collocation multiple times over 4 weeks, and sensor drift was analyzed,
   with the result being a calibration function that included baseline
   drift. Three pairs of M-Pods were deployed, while users individually
   carried the other three.
   The user study suggested that inter-M-Pod variability between paired
   units was on the same order as calibration uncertainty; however, it is
   difficult to make conclusions about the actual personal exposure levels
   due to the level of user engagement. The user study provided real-world
   sensor drift data, showing limited CO drift (under -0.05 ppm day(-1)),
   and higher for O-3 (-2.6 to 2.0 ppb day-1), NO2 (-1.56 to 0.51 ppb
   day(-1)), and CO2 (-4.2 to 3.1 ppm day(-1)). Overall, the user study
   confirmed the utility of the M-Pod as a low-cost tool to assess personal
   exposure.}},

Title = {{LiDAR measurement of seasonal snow accumulation along an elevation

Abstract = {{We present results from snow-on and snow-off airborne-scanning LiDAR
   measurements over a 53 km(2) area in the southern Sierra Nevada. We
   found that snow depth as a function of elevation increased approximately
   15 cm per 100 m, until reaching an elevation of 3300 m, where depth
   sharply decreased at a rate of 48 cm per 100 m. Departures from the 15
   cm per 100 m trend, based on 1 m elevation-band means of regression
   residuals, showed slightly less steep increases below 2050 m; steeper
   increases between 2050 and 3300 m; and less steep increases above 3300
   m. Although the study area is partly forested, only measurements in open
   areas were used. Below approximately 2050 m elevation, ablation and
   rainfall are the primary causes of departure from the orographic trend.
   From 2050 to 3300 m, greater snow depths than predicted were found on
   the steeper terrain of the northwest and the less steep northeast-facing
   slopes, suggesting that ablation, aspect, slope and wind redistribution
   all play a role in local snow-depth variability. At elevations above
   3300 m, orographic processes mask the effect of wind deposition when
   averaging over large areas. Also, terrain in this basin becomes less
   steep above 3300 m. This suggests a reduction in precipitation from
   upslope lifting and/or the exhaustion of precipitable water from
   ascending air masses. Our results suggest a cumulative precipitation
   lapse rate for the 2100-3300 m range of about 6 cm per 100 m elevation
   for the accumulation period of 3 December 2009 to 23 March 2010. This is
   a higher gradient than the widely used PRISM (Parameter-elevation
   Relationships on Independent Slopes Model) precipitation products, but
   similar to that from re-construction of snowmelt amounts from satellite
   snow-cover data. Our findings provide a unique characterization of the
   consistent, steep average increase in precipitation with elevation in
   snow-dominated terrain, using high-resolution, highly accurate data and
   highlighs the importance of solar radiation, wind redistribution and
   mid-winter melt with regard to snow distribution.}},

Title = {{Horton laws for hydraulic-geometric variables and their scaling
   exponents in self-similar Tokunaga river networks}},
Journal = {{NONLINEAR PROCESSES IN GEOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{An analytical theory is developed that obtains Horton laws for six
   hydraulic-geometric (H-G) variables (stream discharge Q, width W, depth
   D, velocity U, slope S, and friction n') in self-similar Tokunaga
   networks in the limit of a large network order. The theory uses several
   disjoint theoretical concepts like Horton laws of stream numbers and
   areas as asymptotic relations in Tokunaga networks, dimensional
   analysis, the Buckingham Pi theorem, asymptotic self-similarity of the
   first kind, or SS-1, and asymptotic self-similarity of the second kind,
   or SS-2. A self-contained review of these concepts, with examples, is
   given as ``methods{''}. The H-G data sets in channel networks from three
   published studies and one unpublished study are summarized to test
   theoretical predictions. The theory builds on six independent
   dimensionless river-basin numbers. A mass conservation equation in terms
   of Horton bifurcation and discharge ratios in Tokunaga networks is
   derived. Assuming that the H-G variables are homogeneous and
   self-similar functions of stream discharge, it is shown that the
   functions are of a power law form. SS-1 is applied to predict the Horton
   laws for width, depth and velocity as asymptotic relationships.
   Exponents of width and the Reynolds number are predicted and tested
   against three field data sets. One basin shows deviations from
   theoretical predictions. Tentatively assuming that SS-1 is valid for
   slope, depth and velocity, corresponding Horton laws and the H-G
   exponents are derived. Our predictions of the exponents are the same as
   those previously predicted for the optimal channel network (OCN) model.
   In direct contrast to our work, the OCN model does not consider Horton
   laws for the H-G variables, and uses optimality assumptions. The
   predicted exponents deviate substantially from the values obtained from
   three field studies, which suggests that H-G in networks does not obey
   SS-1. It fails because slope, a dimensionless river-basin number, goes
   to 0 as network order increases, but, it cannot be eliminated from the
   asymptotic limit. Therefore, a generalization of SS-1, based on SS-2, is
   considered. It introduces two anomalous scaling exponents as free
   parameters, which enables us to show the existence of Horton laws for
   channel depth, velocity, slope and Manning friction. These two exponents
   are not predicted here. Instead, we used the observed exponents of depth
   and slope to predict the Manning friction exponent and to test it
   against field exponents from three studies. The same basin mentioned
   above shows some deviation from the theoretical prediction. A physical
   reason for this deviation is given, which identifies an important topic
   for research. Finally, we briefly sketch how the two anomalous scaling
   exponents could be estimated from the transport of suspended sediment
   load and the bed load. Statistical variability in the Horton laws for
   the H-G variables is also discussed. Both are important open problems
   for future research.}},

Abstract = {{Several sources of error exist in lidar measurements for feedforward
   control of wind turbines including the ability to detect only radial
   velocities, spatial averaging, and wind evolution. This paper
   investigates another potential source of error: the upstream induction
   zone. The induction zone can directly affect lidar measurements and
   presents an opportunity for further decorrelation between upstream wind
   and the wind that interacts with the rotor. The impact of the induction
   zone is investigated using the combined CFD and aeroelastic code SOWFA.
   Lidar measurements are simulated upstream of a 5 MW turbine rotor and
   the true wind disturbances are found using a wind speed estimator and
   turbine outputs. Lidar performance in the absence of an induction zone
   is determined by simulating lidar measurements and the turbine response
   using the aeroelastic code FAST with wind inputs taken far upstream of
   the original turbine location in the SOWFA wind field. Results indicate
   that while measurement quality strongly depends on the amount of wind
   evolution, the induction zone has little effect. However, the optimal
   lidar preview distance and circular scan radius change slightly due to
   the presence of the induction zone.}},

Title = {{Free and Forced Vibration Analysis of an Infilled Steel Frame:
   Experimental, Numerical, and Analytical Methods}},
Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Structural frames with masonry infill panels make up a significant
   portion of the buildings constructed in earthquake-prone areas prior to
   the developing of the seismic design standards. In this paper, the
   effects of masonry panels on the vibration response of an infilled
   steel-frame building are investigated. Various ambient and steady state
   forced vibration tests are carried out to realize the dynamic
   characteristics of the system. 3D finite element models of the building
   with and without infill panels are provided based on marcomodeling
   theorem. A set of analytical approximate formulas are also derived to
   estimate the vibrational period. The natural frequencies of the building
   are computed using numerical, analytical, and experimental methods. The
   results show that neglecting the effect of infill panels leads to
   considerable error. Moreover, it is shown that there is good agreement
   among the results obtained by the three methods considering the effect
   of infill panels.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a simple payoff-based learning rule that is completely
   decentralized and that leads to an efficient configuration of actions in
   any n-person finite strategic-form game with generic payoffs. The
   algorithm follows the theme of exploration versus exploitation and is
   hence stochastic in nature. We prove that if all agents adhere to this
   algorithm, then the agents will select the action profile that maximizes
   the sum of the agents' payoffs a high percentage of time. The algorithm
   requires no communication. Agents respond solely to changes in their own
   realized payoffs, which are affected by the actions of other agents in
   the system in ways that they do not necessarily understand. The method
   can be applied to the optimization of complex systems with many
   distributed components, such as the routing of information in networks
   and the design and control of wind farms. The proof of the proposed
   learning algorithm relies on the theory of large deviations for
   perturbed Markov chains.}},

Abstract = {{A disordered chiral conglomerate, the random grain boundary (RGB) phase,
   has been observed below the smectic A liquid crystal phase of an
   achiral, hockey-stick molecule. In cells, the RGB phase appears dark
   between crossed polarizers but decrossing the polarizers reveals large
   left-and right-handed chiral domains with opposite optical rotation.
   Freeze-fracture transmission electron microscopy reveals that the RGB
   phase is an assembly of randomly oriented blocks of smectic layers, an
   arrangement that distinguishes the RGB from the dark, chiral
   conglomerate phases of bent-core mesogens. X-ray diffraction indicates
   that there is significant layer shrinkage at the SmA-RGB phase
   transition, which is marked by the collapse of layers with long-range
   order into small, randomly oriented smectic blocks.}},

Title = {{Measuring cellular forces using bis-aliphatic hydrazone crosslinked

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{46}},
Pages = {{9230-9236}},
Abstract = {{Studies focused on understanding the role of matrix biophysical signals
   on cells, especially those when cells are encapsulated in hydrogels that
   are locally remodelled, are often complicated by appropriate methods to
   measure differences between the bulk and local material properties. From
   this perspective, stress-relaxing materials that allow long-term culture
   of embedded cells provide an opportunity to elucidate aspects of this
   biophysical signalling. In particular, rheological characterization of
   the stress relaxation properties allows one to link a bulk material
   measurement to local aspects of cellular functions by quantifying the
   corresponding cellular forces that must be applied locally. Here,
   embryonic stem cell-derived motor neurons were encapsulated in a
   well-characterized covalently adaptable bis-aliphatic hydrazone
   crosslinked PEG hydrogel, and neurite outgrowth was observed over time.
   Using fundamental physical relationships describing classical mechanics
   and viscoelastic materials, we calculated the forces and energies
   involved in neurite extension, the results of which provide insight to
   the role of biophysical cues on this process.}},

Title = {{The AeroCom evaluation and intercomparison of organic aerosol in global
   models}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{10845-10895}},
Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the current status of global modeling of the
   organic aerosol (OA) in the troposphere and analyzes the differences
   between models as well as between models and observations. Thirty-one
   global chemistry transport models (CTMs) and general circulation models
   (GCMs) have participated in this intercomparison, in the framework of
   AeroCom phase II. The simulation of OA varies greatly between models in
   terms of the magnitude of primary emissions, secondary OA (SOA)
   formation, the number of OA species used (2 to 62), the complexity of OA
   parameterizations (gas-particle partitioning, chemical aging, multiphase
   chemistry, aerosol microphysics), and the OA physical, chemical and
   optical properties. The diversity of the global OA simulation results
   has increased since earlier AeroCom experiments, mainly due to the
   increasing complexity of the SOA parameterization in models, and the
   implementation of new, highly uncertain, OA sources. Diversity of over
   one order of magnitude exists in the modeled vertical distribution of OA
   concentrations that deserves a dedicated future study. Furthermore,
   although the OA/OC ratio depends on OA sources and atmospheric
   processing, and is important for model evaluation against OA and OC
   observations, it is resolved only by a few global models.
   The median global primary OA (POA) source strength is 56 Tg a(-1) (range
   34-144 Tg a(-1)) and the median SOA source strength (natural and
   anthropogenic) is 19 Tg a(-1) (range 13-121 Tg a(-1)). Among the models
   that take into account the semi-volatile SOA nature, the median source
   is calculated to be 51 Tg a(-1) (range 16-121 Tg a(-1)), much larger
   than the median value of the models that calculate SOA in a more
   simplistic way (19 Tg a(-1); range 13-20 Tg a(-1), with one model at 37
   Tg a(-1)). The median atmospheric burden of OA is 1.4 Tg (24 models in
   the range of 0.6-2.0 Tg and 4 between 2.0 and 3.8 Tg), with a median OA
   lifetime of 5.4 days (range 3.8-9.6 days). In models that reported both
   OA and sulfate burdens, the median value of the OA/sulfate burden ratio
   is calculated to be 0.77; 13 models calculate a ratio lower than 1, and
   9 models higher than 1. For 26 models that reported OA deposition
   fluxes, the median wet removal is 70 Tg a(-1) (range 28-209 Tg a(-1)),
   which is on average 85\% of the total OA deposition.
   Fine aerosol organic carbon (OC) and OA observations from continuous
   monitoring networks and individual field campaigns have been used for
   model evaluation. At urban locations, the model-observation comparison
   indicates missing knowledge on anthropogenic OA sources, both strength
   and seasonality. The combined model-measurements analysis suggests the
   existence of increased OA levels during summer due to biogenic SOA
   formation over large areas of the USA that can be of the same order of
   magnitude as the POA, even at urban locations, and contribute to the
   measured urban seasonal pattern.
   Global models are able to simulate the high secondary character of OA
   observed in the atmosphere as a result of SOA formation and POA aging,
   although the amount of OA present in the atmosphere remains largely
   underestimated, with a mean normalized bias (MNB) equal to -0.62 (-0.51)
   based on the comparison against OC (OA) urban data of all models at the
   surface, -0.15 (+0.51) when compared with remote measurements, and -0.30
   for marine locations with OC data. The mean temporal correlations across
   all stations are low when compared with OC (OA) measurements: 0.47
   (0.52) for urban stations, 0.39 (0.37) for remote stations, and 0.25 for
   marine stations with OC data. The combination of high (negative) MNB and
   higher correlation at urban stations when compared with the low MNB and
   lower correlation at remote sites suggests that knowledge about the
   processes that govern aerosol processing, transport and removal, on top
   of their sources, is important at the remote stations. There is no clear
   change in model skill with increasing model complexity with regard to OC
   or OA mass concentration. However, the complexity is needed in models in
   order to distinguish between anthropogenic and natural OA as needed for
   climate mitigation, and to calculate the impact of OA on climate
   accurately.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric black carbon (BC) is a leading climate warming agent, yet
   uncertainties on the global direct radiative forcing (DRF) remain large.
   Here we expand a global model simulation (GEOS-Chem) of BC to include
   the absorption enhancement associated with BC coating and separately
   treat both the aging and physical properties of fossil-fuel and
   biomass-burning BC. In addition we develop a global simulation of brown
   carbon (BrC) from both secondary (aromatic) and primary (biomass burning
   and biofuel) sources. The global mean lifetime of BC in this simulation
   (4.4 days) is substantially lower compared to the AeroCom I model means
   (7.3 days), and as a result, this model captures both the mass
   concentrations measured in near-source airborne field campaigns (ARCTAS,
   EUCAARI) and surface sites within 30\%, and in remote regions (HIPPO)
   within a factor of 2. We show that the new BC optical properties
   together with the inclusion of BrC reduces the model bias in absorption
   aerosol optical depth (AAOD) at multiple wavelengths by more than 50\%
   at AERONET sites worldwide. However our improved model still
   underestimates AAOD by a factor of 1.4 to 2.8 regionally, with the
   largest underestimates in regions influenced by fire. Using the RRTMG
   model integrated with GEOS-Chem we estimate that the all-sky
   top-of-atmosphere DRF of BC is +0.13 Wm(-2) (0.08 Wm(-2) from
   anthropogenic sources and 0.05 Wm(-2) from biomass burning). If we scale
   our model to match AERONET AAOD observations we estimate the DRF of BC
   is +0.21 Wm(-2), with an additional +0.11 Wm(-2) of warming from BrC.
   Uncertainties in size, optical properties, observations, and emissions
   suggest an overall uncertainty in BC DRF of -80\%/+140\%. Our estimates
   are at the lower end of the 0.2-1.0 Wm(-2) range from previous studies,
   and substantially less than the +0.6 Wm(-2) DRF estimated in the IPCC
   5th Assessment Report. We suggest that the DRF of BC has previously been
   overestimated due to the overestimation of the BC lifetime (including
   the effect on the vertical profile) and the incorrect attribution of BrC
   absorption to BC.}},

Abstract = {{Replacing the liquid electrolyte in a lithium battery with a solid
   electrolyte can resolve many inherent safety issues as well as enable
   the use of next generation electrode materials. Recent research in solid
   electrolytes, however, has mainly focused on improving ionic
   conductivity while neglecting compatibility with energy dense anodes
   such as lithium metal. Herein, we report a new crystalline solid
   electrolyte devised to be inexpensive, highly conductive, and compatible
   with lithium metal. This study presents and characterizes an analog to
   Li10GeP2S12 using the isovalent ion of silicon to displace germanium as
   a cost effective constituent. The crystal Li10SiP2S12 displays a
   conductivity of 2.3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1), the highest reported conductivity
   for an unsintered silicon-based solid electrolyte. Impedance
   spectroscopy is used to probe interactions between the new superionic
   conductor and lithium metal revealing a more favorable decomposition
   than previous metal containing electrolytes. Due to the enhanced
   compatibility of Li10SiP2S12 with lithium metal, we present one of the
   longest cycling bulk solid-state lithium metal batteries to date.
   Discerning the nature of chemical decomposition at the
   electrolyte-lithium interface is essential to the design and synthesis
   of future solid electrolytes. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical Society. All

   reactions in epoxy thermoset polymers}},
Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{89}},
Pages = {{48682-48690}},
Abstract = {{Thermally malleable polymers which undergo covalent bond exchange
   reactions (BERs) have been shown to be able to rearrange their network
   topology at high temperatures without impairing the network integrity.
   At low temperatures, the BERs are so sluggish that the materials behave
   like traditional thermosetting polymers. In this paper, we demonstrated
   that the temperature dependent BER rate could be tuned by adjusting the
   stoichiometry of monomers. As the ratio of hard segments in the epoxy
   thermoset network is increased, the material's glass transition
   temperature (T-g) is increased, with a corresponding increase in the
   temperature required to achieve a given stress relaxation rate. The
   material stress relaxation behavior was studied from both a theoretical
   and experimental point of view. Based on the kinetics of BERs, we
   derived the detailed expression of stress relaxation time, which reveals
   an Arrhenius type dependency of material relaxation behavior on the
   applied temperature. Subsequently, from the experimental stress
   relaxation curves, we determined the energy barrier for the BERs in
   different networks. With the T-g being elevated from 30.3 degrees C to
   63.0 degrees C, the BER energy barrier is linearly increased from 68.2
   kJ mol(-1) to 97.3 kJ mol(-1). Such a correlation between these two
   thermomechanical behaviors provides an additional design parameter
   (beyond catalyst choice) which can aid in achieving highly tunable
   service conditions for practical engineering applications of thermally
   malleable thermosets.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive study of the downlink performance in a
   heterogeneous cellular network (or hetnet) is conducted. A general
   hetnet model is considered consisting of an arbitrary number of
   open-access and closed-access tier of base stations (BSs) arranged
   according to independent homogeneous Poisson point processes. The BSs of
   each tier have a constant transmission power, random fading coefficient
   with an arbitrary distribution and arbitrary path-loss exponent of the
   power-law path-loss model. For such a system, analytical
   characterizations for the coverage probability and average rate at an
   arbitrary mobile-station (MS), and average per-tier load are derived for
   the max-SINR connectivity model. Using stochastic ordering, interesting
   properties and simplifications for the hetnet downlink performance are
   derived by relating this connectivity model to the maximum instantaneous
   received power (MIRP) connectivity model, providing good insights about
   the hetnets and the downlink performance in these complex networks.
   Furthermore, the results also demonstrate the effectiveness and
   analytical tractability of the stochastic geometric approach to study
   the hetnet performance.}},

Abstract = {{Compound eyes in arthropods demonstrate distinct imaging characteristics
   from human eyes, with wide angle field of view, low aberrations, high
   acuity to motion and infinite depth of field. Artificial imaging systems
   with similar geometries and properties are of great interest for many
   applications. However, the challenges in building such systems with
   hemispherical, compound apposition layouts cannot be met through
   established planar sensor technologies and conventional optics. We
   present our recent progress in combining optics, materials, mechanics
   and integration schemes to build fully functional artificial compound
   eye cameras. Nearly full hemispherical shapes (about 160 degrees) with
   densely packed artificial ommatidia were realized. The number of
   ommatidia (180) is comparable to those of the eyes of fire ants and bark
   beetles. The devices combine elastomeric compound optical elements with
   deformable arrays of thin silicon photodetectors, which were fabricated
   in the planar geometries and then integrated and elastically transformed
   to hemispherical shapes. Imaging results and quantitative
   ray-tracing-based simulations illustrate key features of operation.
   These general strategies seem to be applicable to other compound eye
   devices, such as those inspired by moths and lacewings (refracting
   superposition eyes), lobster and shrimp (reflecting superposition eyes),
   and houseflies (neural superposition eyes).}},

Abstract = {{The present work proposes a novel nonintrusive, i.e., sampling-based,
   framework for approximating stochastic solutions of interest admitting
   sparse multiresolution expansions. The coefficients of such expansions
   are computed via greedy approximation techniques that require a number
   of solution realizations smaller than the cardinality of the
   multiresolution basis. The effect of various random sampling strategies
   is investigated. The proposed methodology is verified on a number of
   benchmark problems involving nonsmooth stochastic responses, and is
   applied to quantifying the efficiency of a passive vibration control
   system operating under uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a two-dimensional structure of the shock wave
   signatures in ionospheric electron density resulting from a rocket
   transit using the rate of change of the total electron content (TEC)
   derived from ground-based GPS receivers around Japan and Taiwan for the
   first time. From the TEC maps constructed for the 2009 North Korea (NK)
   Taepodong-2 and 2013 South Korea (SK) Korea Space Launch Vehicle-II
   (KSLV-II) rocket launches, features of the V-shaped shock wave fronts in
   TEC perturbations are prominently seen. These fronts, with periods of
   100-600 s, produced by the propulsive blasts of the rockets appear
   immediately and then propagate perpendicularly outward from the rocket
   trajectory with supersonic velocities between 800-1200 ms(-1) for both
   events. Additionally, clear rocket exhaust depletions of TECs are seen
   along the trajectory and are deflected by the background thermospheric
   neutral wind. Twenty minutes after the rocket transits, delayed electron
   density perturbation waves propagating along the bow wave direction
   appear with phase velocities of 800-1200 ms(-1). According to their
   propagation character, these delayed waves may be generated by rocket
   exhaust plumes at earlier rocket locations at lower altitudes.}},

Abstract = {{The EOS (Earth Observing System) Aura Tropospheric Emission Spectrometer
   (TES) retrieves the atmospheric HDO/H2O ratio in the mid-to-lower
   troposphere as well as the planetary boundary layer. TES observations of
   water vapor and the HDO isotopologue have been compared with nearly
   coincident in situ airborne measurements for direct validation of the
   TES products. The field measurements were made with a commercially
   available Picarro L1115-i isotopic water analyzer on aircraft over the
   Alaskan interior boreal forest during the three summers of 2011 to 2013.
   TES special observations were utilized in these comparisons. The TES
   averaging kernels and a priori constraints have been applied to the in
   situ data, using version 5 (V005) of the TES data. TES calculated errors
   are compared with the standard deviation (1 sigma) of scan-to-scan
   variability to check consistency with the TES observation error. Spatial
   and temporal variations are assessed from the in situ aircraft
   measurements. It is found that the standard deviation of scan-to-scan
   variability of TES delta D is +/- 34.1\% in the boundary layer and +/-
   26.5\% in the free troposphere. This scan-to-scan variability is
   consistent with the TES estimated error (observation error) of 10-18\%
   after accounting for the atmospheric variations along the TES track of
   +/- 16\% in the boundary layer, increasing to +/- 30\% in the free
   troposphere observed by the aircraft in situ measurements. We estimate
   that TES V005 delta D is biased high by an amount that decreases with
   pressure: approximately +123\% at 1000 hPa, +98\% in the boundary layer
   and +37\% in the free troposphere. The uncertainty in this bias estimate
   is +/- 20 parts per thousand. A correction for this bias has been
   applied to the TES HDO Lite Product data set. After bias correction, we
   show that TES has accurate sensitivity to water vapor isotopologues in
   the boundary layer.}},

Abstract = {{The AquaVIT-1 intercomparison of atmospheric water vapor measurement
   techniques was conducted at the aerosol and cloud simulation chamber
   AIDA (Aerosol Interaction and Dynamics in the Atmosphere) at the
   Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, in October 2007. The overall
   objective was to intercompare state-of-the-art and prototype atmospheric
   hygrometers with each other and with independent humidity standards
   under controlled conditions. This activity was conducted as a blind
   intercomparison with coordination by selected referees. The effort was
   motivated by persistent discrepancies found in atmospheric measurements
   involving multiple instruments operating on research aircraft and
   balloon platforms, particularly in the upper troposphere and lower
   stratosphere, where water vapor reaches its lowest atmospheric values
   (less than 10 ppm). With the AIDA chamber volume of 84 m(3), multiple
   instruments analyzed air with a common water vapor mixing ratio, by
   extracting air into instrument flow systems, by locating instruments
   inside the chamber, or by sampling the chamber volume optically. The
   intercomparison was successfully conducted over 10 days during which
   pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio were systematically varied (50
   to 500 hPa, 185 to 243 K, and 0.3 to 152 ppm). In the absence of an
   accepted reference instrument, the absolute accuracy of the instruments
   was not established. To evaluate the intercomparison, the reference
   value was taken to be the ensemble mean of a core subset of the
   measurements. For these core instruments, the agreement between 10 and
   150 ppm of water vapor is considered good with variation about the
   reference value of about +/- 10\% (+/- 1 sigma). In the region of most
   interest between 1 and 10 ppm, the core subset agreement is fair with
   variation about the reference value of +/- 20\% (+/- 1 sigma). The upper
   limit of precision was also derived for each instrument from the
   reported data. The implication for atmospheric measurements is that the
   substantially larger differences observed during in-flight
   intercomparisons stem from other factors associated with the moving
   platforms or the non-laboratory environment. The success of AquaVIT-1
   provides a template for future intercomparison efforts with water vapor
   or other species that are focused on improving the analytical quality of
   atmospheric measurements on moving platforms.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the lack of high-power sources along with strong electromagnetic
   absorption by water vapor at frequencies between similar to 100 GHz and
   similar to 10 THz, there are very few radar systems, or any other
   systems for that matter, operating in this region of the spectrum. For
   this reason, it is sometimes referred to as the terahertz gap. Source
   technology, however, is improving, thus facilitating radar systems
   operating in this new frontier of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the
   lower end of this spectral region near the millimeter/submillimeter
   transition, components are more readily available and atmospheric
   attenuation is moderate in comparison to higher frequencies. Utilizing
   components that can generate on the order of 50 mW of power, a real
   aperture radar for imaging surfaces up to several hundred meters has
   been developed. The goal of this research is to determine if this

Journal = {{HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES}},

Abstract = {{This study adopted a differential land-use/land-cover (LULC) analysis to
   evaluate dam-triggered land-atmosphere interactions for a number of LULC
   scenarios. Two specific questions were addressed: (1) can dam-triggered
   LULC heterogeneities modify surface and energy budget, which, in turn,
   change regional convergence and precipitation patterns? (2) How
   extensive is the modification in surface moisture and energy budget
   altered by dam-triggered LULC changes occurring in different climate and
   terrain features? The Regional Atmospheric Modeling System (RAMS,
   version 6.0) was set up for two climatologically and topographically
   contrasting regions: the American River watershed (ARW), located in
   California, and the Owyhee River watershed (ORW), located in eastern
   Oregon. For the selected atmospheric river precipitation event of 29
   December 1996 to 3 January 1997, simulations of three pre-defined LULC
   scenarios are performed. The definition of the scenarios are (1) the
   ``control{''} scenario, representing the contemporary land use, (2) the
   ``pre-dam{''} scenario, representing the natural landscape before the
   construction of the dams and (3) the ``non-irrigation{''} scenario,
   representing the condition where previously irrigated landscape in the
   control is transformed to the nearby land-use type. Results indicated
   that the ARW energy and moisture fluxes were more extensively affected
   by dam-induced changes in LULC than the ORW. Both regions, however,
   displayed commonalities in the modification of land-atmosphere processes
   due to LULC changes, with the control-non-irrigation scenario creating
   more change than the control-pre-dam scenarios. These commonalities
   were: (1) the combination of a decrease in temperature (up to 0.15
   degrees C) and an increase at dew point (up to 0.25 degrees C) was
   observed; (2) there was a larger fraction of energy partitioned to
   latent heat flux (up to 10 W m(-2)) that increased the amount of water
   vapor in the atmosphere and resulted in a larger convective available
   potential energy (CAPE); (3) low-level wind-flow variation was found to
   be responsible for pressure gradients that affected localized
   circulations, moisture advection and convergence. At some locations, an
   increase in wind speed up to 1.6 m s(-1) maximum was observed; (4) there
   were also areas of well-developed vertical motions responsible for
   moisture transport from the surface to higher altitudes that enhanced
   precipitation patterns in the study regions.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{This study investigated compressive strength, chloride penetration, and
   freeze-thaw resistance of multiwalled carbon nanotube (MWNT) concrete.
   More than 100 cylindrical specimens were used to assess test variables
   during sensitivity observations, including water-cement ratios (0.75,
   0.5, and 0.4) and exposure to chemical agents (including gum arabic,
   propanol, ethanol, sodium polyacrylate, methylcellulose, sodium dodecyl
   sulfate, and silane). To determine the adequate sonication time for MWNT
   dispersal in water, the compressive strengths of MWNT concrete cylinders
   were measured after sonication times ranging from 2 to 24 minutes. The
   results demonstrated that the addition of MWNT can increase the
   compressive strength of concrete by up to 108\%. However, without
   chemical treatment, MWNT concretes tend to have poor freeze-thaw
   resistance. Among the different chemical treatments, MWNT concrete
   treated with sodium polyacrylate has the best compressive strength,
   chloride resistance, and freeze-thaw durability.}},

Abstract = {{The degradation of the difference between supply and return water
   temperature from design values is a condition found in many chilled and
   hot water distribution plants, leading to a significant waste of
   distribution and primary system energy. Here, several strategies aimed
   at preventing delta-T degradation are compared using simulations and
   field tests. Unnecessarily high flow through the heat exchanger (
   heating or cooling coil) is one cause of delta-T degradation. Limiting
   either the delta-T or the flow across the heat exchanger are two known
   approaches to reduce delta-T degradation on the primary side. A novel
   strategy, termed flow/delta-T limiting, is introduced and compared to
   the existing flow and delta-T limiting strategies. It is found that flow
   limiting is superior when either inlet air or water temperature is
   fluctuating. Conversely, delta-T limiting is superior when either
   entering air humidity or airflow rate is fluctuating. Because the
   numerous variables impacting heat exchanger behavior are typically
   changing simultaneously, the question arises which strategy is best?
   Through simulation studies it has been shown that flow/delta-T limiting
   is the preferred strategy that provides results falling between the flow
   and delta-T limiting approaches while maintaining acceptable heat
   exchanger performance. The different approaches have been applied to
   data sets acquired on two university campuses with the field tests
   supporting the simulation results.}},

   screening and design of catalysts}},
Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{3748-3761}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption energies have significant value as predictors of catalytic
   performance. An important method of increasing efficiency of adsorption
   energy calculations is to employ scaling relations, which are linear
   relationships between adsorption energies of similar adsorbates. They
   are most commonly used to unify the description of adsorbates that bind
   to the surface through a particular type of atom. In this work, we
   review the development and applications of scaling relations. Scaling
   relations have been observed for a variety of adsorbates bonding through
   C, O, H, N, and S atoms to the surfaces of transition metals, oxides,
   nitrides, sulfides, carbides, and nanoparticles. They can be used to
   increase the efficiency of predictions, simplify descriptions of surface
   reactivity, and sometimes to derive limits on the effectiveness of a
   catalyst. Because scaling relations can impose a significant limitation
   on catalyst design, it is also useful to explore how to design active
   sites that significantly deviate from them. We discuss applications to a
   variety of processes, including methane reforming and synthesis, alcohol
   decomposition and synthesis, electrochemical systems, and conversion of
   biomass derivatives.}},

Abstract = {{A series of donor-acceptor statistical copolymers based on a
   2,7-divinyl-9,9'-di-n-hexylfluorene (FV) donor and
   4,7-bis(4-hexadecyl-5-propenyl-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TBTV)
   acceptor were prepared to investigate the relationship between copolymer
   donor-acceptor ratio and organic solar cell (OSC) performance.
   Homopolymers of the donor and acceptor moieties were prepared by acyclic
   diene metathesis (ADMET) methods. Five copolymers with systematically
   varied donor-acceptor ratios spanning the entire composition range were
   also prepared. All homopolymers and copolymers were characterized using
   size exclusion chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
   ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and electrochemical cyclic
   voltammetry. Additionally, each polymer was incorporated into thin film
   field effect transistor and photovoltaic devices to investigate
   optoelectronic properties. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
   level was found to be tunable over a 600 meV range through systematic
   variation of the copolymer donor-acceptor ratio. This same tunability
   manifested in the solar cell open circuit voltage (V-oc), which also
   varied over a 600 mV range. Short circuit current density (J(sc))
   correlated well with field effect hole mobility. This series exemplifies
   the relationship between copolymer composition, HOMO energy level, and
   V-oc, and demonstrates that peak solar cell performance can be achieved
   at non-stoichiometric donor-acceptor compositions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a state-of-the-art in the use of localized Lagrange
   multipliers (LLMs) for 3D frictional contact problems coupling the
   Finite Element Method (FEM) and the Boundary Element Method (BEM).
   Resolution methods for the contact problem between non-matching meshes
   have traditionally been based on a direct coupling of the contacting
   solids using classical Lagrange multipliers. These methods tend to
   generate strongly coupled systems that require a deep knowledge of the
   discretization characteristics on each side of the contact zone
   complicating the process of mixing different numerical techniques. In
   this work a displacement contact frame is inserted between the FE and BE
   interface meshes, discretized and finally connected to the contacting
   substructures using LLMs collocated at the mesh-interface nodes. This
   methodology will provide a partitioned formulation which preserves
   software modularity and facilitates the connection of non-matching FE
   and BE meshes.}},

Abstract = {{In nature, arthropods have a remarkably sophisticated class of imaging
   systems, with a hemispherical geometry, a wide-angle field of view, low
   aberrations, high acuity to motion and an infinite depth of field. There
   are great interests in building systems with similar geometries and
   properties due to numerous potential applications. However, the
   established semiconductor sensor technologies and optics are essentially
   planar, which experience great challenges in building such systems with
   hemispherical, compound apposition layouts. With the recent advancement
   of stretchable optoelectronics, we have successfully developed
   strategies to build a fully functional artificial apposition compound
   eye camera by combining optics, materials and mechanics principles. The
   strategies start with fabricating stretchable arrays of thin silicon
   photodetectors and elastomeric optical elements in planar geometries,
   which are then precisely aligned and integrated, and elastically
   transformed to hemispherical shapes. This imaging device demonstrates
   nearly full hemispherical shape (about 160 degrees), with densely packed
   artificial ommatidia. The number of ommatidia (180) is comparable to
   those of the eyes of fire ants and bark beetles. We have illustrated key
   features of operation of compound eyes through experimental imaging
   results and quantitative ray-tracing-based simulations. The general
   strategies shown in this development could be applicable to other
   compound eye devices, such as those inspired by moths and lacewings
   (refracting superposition eyes), lobster and shrimp (reflecting
   superposition eyes), and houseflies (neural superposition eyes).}},

Title = {{Molecular simulation study of assembly of DNA-grafted nanoparticles:
   effect of bidispersity in DNA strand length}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR SIMULATION}},

Volume = {{40}},

Pages = {{1085-1098}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we use molecular dynamics simulations to study the
   assembly of DNA-grafted nanoparticles to demonstrate specifically the
   effect of bidispersity in grafted DNA strand length on the
   thermodynamics and structure of nanoparticle assembly at varying number
   of grafted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) strands and number of
   guanine/cytosine (G/C) bases per strand. At constant number of grafted
   ssDNA strands and G/C nucleotides per strand, as bidispersity in strand
   lengths increases, the number of nanoparticles that assemble as well as
   the number of neighbours per particle in the assembled cluster
   increases. When the number of G/C nucleotides per strand in short and
   long strands is equal, the long strands hybridise with the other long
   strands with higher frequency than the short strands hybridise with
   short/long strands. This dominance of the long strands leads to
   bidisperse systems having similar thermodynamics to that in
   corresponding systems with monodisperse long strands. Structurally,
   however, as a result of long-long, long-short and short-short strand
   hybridisation, bidispersity in DNA strand length leads to a broader
   inter-particle distance distribution within the assembled cluster than
   seen in systems with monodisperse short or monodisperse long strands.
   The effect of increasing the number of G/C bases per strand or
   increasing the number of grafted DNA strands on the thermodynamics of
   assembly is similar for bidisperse and monodisperse systems. The effect
   of increasing the number of grafted ssDNA strands on the structure of
   the assembled cluster is dependent on the extent of strand bidispersity
   because the presence of significantly shorter ssDNA strands among long
   ssDNA strands reduces the crowding among the strands at high grafting
   density. This relief in crowding leads to larger number of strands
   hybridised and as a result larger coordination number in the assembled
   cluster in systems with high bidispersity in strands than in
   corresponding monodisperse or low bidispersity systems.}},

Abstract = {{The feedback between soil moisture and precipitation has long been a
   topic of interest due to its potential for improving weather and
   seasonal forecasts. The generally proposed mechanism assumes a control
   of soil moisture on precipitation via the partitioning of the surface
   turbulent heat fluxes, as assessed via the evaporative fraction (EF), i.
   e., the ratio of latent heat to the sum of latent and sensible heat, in
   particular under convective conditions. Our study investigates the
   poorly understood link between EF and precipitation by relating the
   before-noon EF to the frequency of afternoon precipitation over the
   contiguous US, through statistical analyses of multiple EF and
   precipitation data sets. We analyze remote-sensing data products (Global
   Land Evaporation: the Amsterdam Methodology (GLEAM) for EF, and radar
   precipitation from the NEXt generation weather RADar system (NEXRAD)),
   FLUXNET station data, and the North American Regional Reanalysis (NARR).
   Data sets agree on a region of positive relationship between EF and
   precipitation occurrence in the southwestern US. However, a region of
   strong positive relationship over the eastern US in NARR cannot be
   confirmed with observation-derived estimates (GLEAM, NEXRAD and
   FLUXNET). The GLEAM-NEXRAD data set combination indicates a region of
   positive EF-precipitation relationship in the central US. These
   disagreements emphasize large uncertainties in the EF data. Further
   analyses highlight that much of these EF-precipitation relationships
   could be explained by precipitation persistence alone, and it is unclear
   whether EF has an additional role in triggering afternoon precipitation.
   This also highlights the difficulties in isolating a land impact on
   precipitation. Regional analyses point to contrasting mechanisms over
   different regions. Over the eastern US, our analyses suggest that the
   EF-precipitation relationship in NARR is either atmospherically
   controlled (from precipitation persistence and potential evaporation) or
   driven by vegetation interception rather than soil moisture. Although
   this aligns well with the high forest cover and the wet regime of that
   region, the role of interception evaporation is likely overestimated
   because of low nighttime evaporation in NARR. Over the central and
   southwestern US, the EF-precipitation relationship is additionally
   linked to soil moisture variations, owing to the soil-moisture-limited
   climate regime.}},

Abstract = {{Clouds in the fair weather return path of the global electric circuit
   (GEC) reduce conductivity because of the limited mobility of charge due
   to attachment to cloud water droplets, effectively leading to a loss of
   ions. A high-resolution GEC model, which numerically solves the current
   continuity equation in combination with Ohm's law, is used to show that
   return currents partially flow around clouds, with current divergence
   above the cloud and convergence below the cloud. An analysis of this
   effect is presented for various types of clouds, i. e., for different
   altitude extents and for different horizontal dimensions, finding that
   the effect is most pronounced for high clouds with a diameter below 100
   km. Based on these results, a method to calculate column and global
   resistance is developed that can account for all cloud sizes and
   altitudes. The CESM1(WACCM) (Community Earth System Model-Whole
   Atmosphere Community Climate Model) as well as ISCCP (International
   Satellite Cloud Climatology Project) cloud data are used to calculate
   the effect of this phenomenon on global resistance. From CESM1(WACCM),
   it is found that when including clouds in the estimate of resistance the
   global resistance increases by up to 73 \%, depending on the parameters
   used. Using ISCCP cloud cover leads to an even larger increase, which is
   likely to be overestimated because of time averaging of cloud cover.
   Neglecting current divergence/convergence around small clouds
   overestimates global resistance by up to 20\% whereas the method
   introduced by previous studies underestimates global resistance by up to
   40 \%. For global GEC models, a conductivity parameterization is
   developed to account for the current divergence/convergence phenomenon
   around clouds. Conductivity simulations from CESM1(WACCM) using this
   parameterization are presented.}},

Title = {{Modeling regional aerosol and aerosol precursor variability over
   California and its sensitivity to emissions and long-range transport

Abstract = {{The performance of the Weather Research and Forecasting regional model
   with chemistry (WRF-Chem) in simulating the spatial and temporal
   variations in aerosol mass, composition, and size over California is
   quantified using the extensive meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol
   measurements collected during the California Nexus of Air Quality and
   Climate Experiment (CalNex) and the Carbonaceous Aerosol and Radiative
   Effects Study (CARES) conducted during May and June of 2010. The overall
   objective of the field campaigns was to obtain data needed to better
   under-stand processes that affect both climate and air quality,
   including emission assessments, transport and chemical aging of
   aerosols, aerosol radiative effects. Simulations were performed that
   examined the sensitivity of aerosol concentrations to anthropogenic
   emissions and to long-range transport of aerosols into the domain
   obtained from a global model. The configuration of WRF-Chem used in this
   study is shown to reproduce the overall synoptic conditions, thermally
   driven circulations, and boundary layer structure observed in region
   that controls the transport and mixing of trace gases and aerosols.
   Reducing the default emissions inventory by 50\% led to an overall
   improvement in many simulated trace gases and black carbon aerosol at
   most sites and along most aircraft flight paths; however, simulated
   organic aerosol was closer to observed when there were no adjustments to
   the primary organic aerosol emissions. We found that sulfate was better
   simulated over northern California whereas nitrate was better simulated
   over southern California. While the overall spatial and temporal
   variability of aerosols and their precursors were simulated reasonably
   well, we show cases where the local transport of some aerosol plumes
   were either too slow or too fast, which adversely affects the statistics
   quantifying the differences between observed and simulated quantities.
   Comparisons with lidar and in situ measurements indicate that long-range
   transport of aerosols from the global model was likely too high in the
   free troposphere even though their concentrations were relatively low.
   This bias led to an over-prediction in aerosol optical depth by as much
   as a factor of 2 that offset the under-predictions of boundary-layer
   extinction resulting primarily from local emissions. Lowering the
   boundary conditions of aerosol concentrations by 50\% greatly reduced
   the bias in simulated aerosol optical depth for all regions of
   California. This study shows that quantifying regional-scale variations
   in aerosol radiative forcing and determining the relative role of
   emissions from local and distant sources is challenging during `clean'
   conditions and that a wide array of measurements are needed to ensure
   model predictions are correct for the right reasons. In this regard, the
   combined CalNex and CARES data sets are an ideal test bed that can be
   used to evaluate aerosol models in great detail and develop improved
   treatments for aerosol processes.}},

   Here we show how reconfigurable clusters made of N colloidal particles
   bound flexibly to a central colloidal sphere have the capacity to store
   an amount of information that increases as O(N ln(N)). Using Brownian
   dynamics simulations, we predict dynamical regimes that allow for
   information to be written, saved, and erased. We experimentally assemble
   an N = 4 reconfigurable cluster from chemically synthesized colloidal
   building blocks, and monitor its equilibrium dynamics. We observe state
   switching in agreement with simulations. This cluster can store one bit

Abstract = {{Chemical contamination of drinking water sources is a worldwide problem.
   However, few locally managed, sustainable, and low-cost on-site
   treatment technologies are available in rural, remote, and
   emergency/disaster relief/humanitarian crisis situations. Char
   filter-adsorbers have been used to treat drinking water for thousands of
   years and are still widely used today. Our studies show that some chars
   produced by traditional means from a range of feedstocks develop
   favorable sorption properties for uptake of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic
   acid (2,4-D), a prevalent herbicide and water contaminant. However, more
   energy efficient, environmentally sustainable and scalable production of
   consistent highly sorptive chars can be accomplished with biomass
   gasification. Our laboratory studies demonstrate that locally produced
   char adsorbents derived from surplus agricultural and forestry biomass
   are effective for adsorbing 2,4-D. A year-long study of field-scale

Abstract = {{We utilized both resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and
   Schaefer-Bergmann diffraction patterns (SBDP) to measure the elastic
   stiffness coefficients of the trigonal, non-piezo-electric crystal
   alpha-BaB2O4. RUS determines the elastic coefficients of a sample by
   matching measured resonant frequencies to a model of resonances. SBDP
   deduces the elastic coefficients by fitting the measured shape of the
   acousto-optic diffraction pattern to an acoustic slowness surface
   cross-section. We present our measured elastic coefficients of
   alpha-BaB2O4 from both RUS and SBDP experiments.}},

Title = {{Carbon cycle uncertainty in the Alaskan Arctic}},
Journal = {{BIOGEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{4271-4288}},
Abstract = {{Climate change is leading to a disproportionately large warming in the
   high northern latitudes, but the magnitude and sign of the future carbon
   balance of the Arctic are highly uncertain. Using 40 terrestrial
   biosphere models for the Alaskan Arctic from four recent model
   intercomparison projects - NACP (North American Carbon Program) site and
   regional syntheses, TRENDY (Trends in net land atmosphere carbon
   exchanges), and WETCHIMP (Wetland and Wetland CH4 Inter-comparison of
   Models Project) - we provide a baseline of terrestrial carbon cycle
   uncertainty, defined as the multi-model standard deviation (sigma) for
   each quantity that follows. Mean annual absolute uncertainty was largest
   for soil carbon (14.0+/-9.2 kgCm(-2)), then gross primary production
   (GPP) (0.22+/-0.50 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), ecosystem respiration (Re)
   (0.23+/-0.38 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), net primary production (NPP) (0.14+/-0.33
   kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), autotrophic respiration (Ra) (0.09+/-0.20 kgCm(-2)
   yr(-1)), heterotrophic respiration (Rh) (0.14+/-0.20 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)),
   net ecosystem exchange (NEE) (-0.01+/-0.19 kgCm(-2) yr(-1)), and CH4
   flux (2.52+/-4.02 g CH4 m(-2) yr(-1)). There were no consistent spatial
   patterns in the larger Alaskan Arctic and boreal regional carbon stocks
   and fluxes, with some models showing NEE for Alaska as a strong carbon
   sink, others as a strong carbon source, while still others as carbon
   neutral. Finally, AmeriFlux data are used at two sites in the Alaskan
   Arctic to evaluate the regional patterns; observed seasonal NEE was
   captured within multi-model uncertainty. This assessment of carbon cycle
   uncertainties may be used as a baseline for the improvement of
   experimental and modeling activities, as well as a reference for future
   trajectories in carbon cycling with climate change in the Alaskan Arctic
   and larger boreal region.}},
