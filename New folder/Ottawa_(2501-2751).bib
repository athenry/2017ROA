Title = {{The effect of SO2 on CO2 capture by CaO-based pellets prepared with a
   kaolin derived Al(OH)(3) binder}},

Abstract = {{High-temperature CO2 capture by Ca looping cycles was investigated in
   the presence of SO2. The sorbents tested included natural limestone
   (HV-P), pellets formed from powdered limestone with a binder (HV-AH) and
   pellets formed from powdered acetified limestone with a binder
   (HV10-AH). The binder used in pellet preparation was Al(OH)(3) obtained
   from acid leaching of kaolin. Simulated flue gas with a composition of
   15\% CO2, 3\% O-2, 0.45\% SO2, and N-2 balance was used during the CO2
   capture step. Two calcination conditions were employed for sorbent
   regeneration: pure CO2 at 920 degrees C and pure N-2 at 850 degrees C.
   By five reaction cycles, the well-developed porous texture of HV10-AH
   acetified by 10 vol.\% acetic acid did not offer better CO2 capture than
   that for natural limestone at 650 degrees C for calcination in CO2:
   instead it promoted a higher SO2 retention than that for the limestone.
   Unfortunately, the CO2 capture capacity for all sorbents calcined in CO2
   in the presence of SO2 was effectively eliminated after 2-3 cycles.
   Calcination in N-2 did not significantly enhance CO2 sorbent capture
   capacity; but instead it improved the SO2 retention ability of HV10-AH,
   for which the sulphation level was over twice that of the natural
   limestone. Increasing the carbonation temperature to 700 degrees C
   enhanced sulphation rather than carbonation with HV10-AH, but produced
   the opposite effect with natural limestone. In general, it appears that
   SO2 impedes CO2 capture, leading to a negligible CO2 capture capacity
   after only few cycles regardless of how the sorbent morphology is
   modified, which suggests any method designed to improve sorbent
   performance for CO2 capture will not be proof against significant SO2
   concentrations in flue gas. These results suggest that despite the fact
   that sorbent performance can be influenced to some extent by altering
   carbonation and calcination conditions; the presence of SO2 must be
   avoided if the objective is CO2 capture from flue gas. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Title = {{Effect of fluidizing particle size on electrostatic charge generation
   and reactor wall fouling in gas-solid fluidized beds}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{552-563}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Electrostatic charge generation from particle-particle and particle-wall
   contacts in gas-solid fluidized beds is virtually unavoidable and
   generally undesired. Charged particles are known to cause problems
   including particle agglomeration and particle-reactor wall adhesion. The
   polymerization industry has been plagued by reactor wall fouling for
   many years, but the actual mechanism behind this problem is not well
   understood. The wide particle size distribution present in polyolefin
   fluidized bed reactors is believed to play an important role. This work
   studied the effect of particle size of a polyethylene resin received
   directly from industrial reactors on electrostatic charge generation and
   reactor wall fouling. The resin was sieved into five different narrowed
   particle size fractions and fluidized at two different gas velocities;
   1.5 and 4 times the minimum fluidization velocity (u(mf)) representing
   the bubbling and the slugging flow regimes. The fluidization was
   performed in a 0.1 m carbon steel fluidization column with the charge
   measurement technique described by Sowinski et al. (2010). In the
   bubbling flow regime significant particle wall adhesion was found for
   particles sizes up to 600 mu m, after which very little reactor wall
   fouling was observed. In the slugging flow regime, there was significant
   particle wall adhesion for all particle size fractions tested with the
   exception of the 600-710 mu m range, which at times resulted in
   significant particle-wall adhesion and in other times none was obtained.
   Overall, it was found that the smaller particles had a higher charge and
   resulted in more reactor wall fouling. With the non-sieved resin, the
   particles that adhered to the column wall were approximately of the same
   size as the smallest size fraction tested (300-425 mu m). This study
   found that the measurement of the net charge-to-mass ratio inside a
   fluidized bed is not an indication of the amount of reactor wall
   fouling. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel surface modified polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber membrane was
   fabricated via dry-wet phased inversion process where the spinning dope
   contains Surface Modifying Macromolecule (SMM). The surface modified
   membrane exhibited large pore size, higher effective surface porosity,
   contact angle and porosity but lower Liquid Entry Pressure of water
   compared to polyetherimide hollow fiber membrane without SMM.
   The performance of surface modified membrane in contactor application
   for gas separation process was evaluated based on CO2 absorption process
   using water as absorbent and pure CO2 and 20:80 CO2/CH4 gas mixture. The
   results show that surface modified membranes have superior performance
   compared to commercial and in-house made hydrophobic membranes such as
   polypropylene and polytetrafluoroethylene, e.g., in the case of pure CO2
   in the shell side and distilled water in the lumen side, the surface
   modified PEI membrane shows 72\% higher absorption flux than commercial
   membrane contactor, Celgard MiniModule (R) 0.75X5 which is made of
   polypropylene membranes, when the liquid velocity is 0.4 m s(-1). (C)

   absorption}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{99-106}},
Month = {{MAR 22}},
Abstract = {{Porous asymmetric polysolfone (PSf) hollow fiber membranes were
   fabricated using wet spinning process. Glycerol (4 wt.\%) was used as
   additive. Aqueous solutions of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) with
   different composition (0, 50, 70 and 90 wt.\% NMP) were used as bore
   fluid. Distilled water was used to preparing aqueous NMP solutions.
   Structure and performance of resulting membranes in measuring of surface
   porosity, pore size, critical water entry pressure (CEPw) and CO2
   absorption in hollow fiber membrane contactor were investigated. The
   cross-section, the inner skin layer and the inner surface of the
   membranes were examined via scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). Using
   distilled water as bore fluid provided the membrane structure with a
   finger-like macrovoids which extend from the inner and outer surfaces of
   the membranes to the middle of the hollow fiber wall. Other hollow fiber
   membranes formed with a finger-like structure near the other surface and
   a sponge-like structure with holes beneath, which resulted in a high
   CEPw and CO2 absorption rate. In addition, since a mixture of distilled
   water and NMP was used as the neutral bore fluid, the membranes showed a
   skinless inner surface. Results of gas permeation tests showed with
   increasing NMP concentration in the bore fluid the N-2 permeance
   decrease significantly and the wetting resistance decrease slightly. CO2
   absorption by distilled water was conducted through the gas-liquid
   membrane contactors. By employing 90\% NMP in the bore fluid, the PSf
   membrane showed a CO2 flux of approximately 110\% higher than the PSf
   membrane fabricated with distilled water as the internal coagulant at
   the absorbent velocity of 7.9 x 10(-4) m/s. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Background: We study the relation between genome rearrangements,
   breakpoints and gene expression. Genome rearrangement research has been
   concerned with the creation of breakpoints and their position in the
   chromosome, but the functional consequences of individual breakpoints
   remain virtually unknown, and there are no direct genome-wide studies of
   breakpoints from this point of view. A question arises of what the
   biological consequences of breakpoint creation are, rather than just
   their structural aspects. The question is whether proximity to the site
   of a breakpoint event changes the activity of a gene.
   Results: We investigate this by comparing the distribution of distances
   to the nearest breakpoint of genes that are differentially expressed
   with the distribution of the same distances for the entire gene
   complement. We study this in data on whole blood tissue in human versus
   macaque, and in cerebral cortex tissue in human versus chimpanzee. We
   find in both data sets that the distribution of distances to the nearest
   breakpoint of ``changed expression genes{''} differs little from this
   distance calculated for the rest of the gene complement. In focusing on
   the changed expression genes closest to the breakpoints, however, we
   discover that several of these have previously been implicated in the
   literature as being connected to the evolutionary divergence of humans
   from other primates.
   Conclusions: We conjecture that chromosomal rearrangements occasionally
   interrupt the regulatory configurations of genes close to the
   breakpoint, leading to changes in expression.}},

Abstract = {{The fact that some organisms are able to regenerate organs of the
   correct shape and size following amputation is particularly fascinating,
   but the mechanism by which this occurs remains poorly understood. The
   zebrafish (Danio rerio) caudal fin has emerged as a model system for the
   study of bone development and regeneration. The fin comprises 16 to 18
   bony rays, each containing multiple joints along its proximodistal axis
   that give rise to segments. Experimental observations on fin ray growth,
   regeneration and joint formation have been described, but no unified
   theory has yet been put forward to explain how growth and joint patterns
   are controlled. We present a model for the control of fin ray growth
   during development and regeneration, integrated with a model for joint
   pattern formation, which is in agreement with published, as well as new,
   experimental data. We propose that fin ray growth and joint patterning
   are coordinated through the interaction of three morphogens. When the
   model is extended to incorporate multiple rays across the fin, it also
   accounts for how the caudal fin acquires its shape during development,
   and regains its correct size and shape following amputation.}},

Abstract = {{Adsorption of CO2 was investigated on a series of primary, secondary,
   and tertiary monoamine-grafted pore-expanded mesoporous MCM-41 silicas,
   referred to as pMONO, sMONO, and tMONO, respectively. The pMONO
   adsorbent showed the highest CO2 adsorption capacity, followed by sMONO,
   whereas tMONO exhibited hardly any CO2 uptake. As for the stability in
   the presence of dry CO2. we showed in a previous contribution {[}J. Am.
   Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 6312-6314] that amine-supported materials
   deactivate in the presence of dry CO2 via the formation of urea
   linkages. Here, we showed that only primary amines suffered extensive
   loss in CO2 uptake, whereas secondary and tertiary amines were stable
   even at temperature as high as 200 degrees C. The difference in the
   stability of primary vs secondary and tertiary amines was associated
   with the occurrence of isocyanate as intermediate species toward the
   formation of urea groups, since only primary amines can be precursors to
   isocyanate in the presence of CO2. However, using a grafted
   propyldiethylenetriamine containing both primary and secondary amines,
   we demonstrated that while primary amines gave rise to isocyanate, the
   latter can react with either primary or secondary amines to generate di-
   and trisubstituted ureas, leading to deactivation of secondary amines as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{Surface Modifying Macromolecules (SMM) were used to alter the
   hydrophobicity of polyetherimide (PEI) hollow fiber membranes and the
   effects of three fabrication parameters, which are the mass fraction of
   PEI and SMM in the casting dope and air gap, on the properties of
   fabricated membranes were investigated by application of Response
   Surface Methodology (RSM). The fabricated membranes were characterized
   in terms of mean pore size (rP,m), permeation rate of helium gas at 1
   bar transmembrane pressure difference, membrane porosity, and contact
   angle of water with inner and outer surfaces of membrane. The regression
   models obtained for mean pore size and permeation rate have good
   statistical parameters and are accurate. The model for rP,m predicts
   that plot of rP,m versus air gap has a minimum point, whereas the plots
   of rP,m versus PEI (wt \%) and SMM (wt \%) have maximum points. The
   regression model developed for membrane porosity predicts that membrane
   porosity decreases when air gap increases. Since water was used as bore
   fluid, the model developed for inner surface contact angle has low
   accuracy but the model developed for outer surface contact angle
   predicts that contact angle increases with SMM concentration in dope
   solution but there is a maximum point versus air gap. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{The evolution of the embedded cores-based design paradigm in recent
   times has created numerous challenging problems for the test design
   community. To develop suitable test environment and appropriate test
   methodologies for digital cores-based system-on-chip (SOC) is a
   fascinating area of research today. This paper attempts to develop
   viable solution option to these problems based on cores constructed from
   the International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS) 85
   combinational and ISCAS 89 sequential benchmark circuits. The wrapper
   that separates the core under test from other cores is assumed to be
   Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers P1500-compliant. The
   cores and test access mechanism (TAM) are described in the paper using
   Verilog hardware description language, while TAM is implemented as a
   plain signal transport medium, being shared by all the cores in the SOC.
   The fault injection is done by a simulator that also generates the tests
   for the core. The fault simulation process is carried out after
   successful compilation of the cores, the individual core selection being
   done by the program running in the background.}},

Abstract = {{Telecommunication networks call for novel energy-efficient design and
   management schemes as a result of the increasing contribution of the ICT
   sector to electricity consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. Access
   networks, being one of the significant contributors in the last mile,
   require power saving protocols and architectures. As one of the emerging
   access network solutions, convergence of PONs and wireless access
   networks, also named as FiWi, offer to combine the robustness and high
   capacity of optical networks with the mobility and ubiquity of wireless
   networks. In this article, we present an overview and a brief comparison
   of energy-efficient protocols and design approaches in FiWi networks. We
   further propose an energy-efficient bandwidth allocation mechanism in
   FiWi networks that adopts an optical burst switching (OBS)-like report
   generation mechanism in LR-EPON. Through simulations, we show that the
   proposed scheme leads to significant energy savings in the long-reach
   FiWi network while overcoming the delay penalty of the ONU-BS sleep

Abstract = {{Long-reach passive optical networks (LR-PONs) suffer from extremely long
   propagation delays that degrade the performance of centralized
   algorithms proposed for upstream bandwidth allocation in traditional
   PONs. This is because these algorithms are based on bandwidth
   negotiation messages frequently exchanged between the optical line
   terminal in the central office and optical network units near the users,
   which become seriously delayed when the network is extended causing the
   performance to degrade. In this paper, we review and analyze two
   centralized dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms, online interleaved
   polling and offline multi-thread polling that was recently proposed in
   the literature for LR-PONs. We investigate and compare their
   performances together in detail, by studying and observing their
   elemental delays. Unexpectedly, simulation results show that, although
   multi-thread polling succeeds in decreasing reporting and queueing
   delays, interleaved polling keeps a lower grant delay and therefore has
   better overall delay performance. The latter also achieves better
   throughput compared to multi-thread polling.}},

Abstract = {{Cooperative communication is considered a promising technique to
   increase channel capacity and improve reliability in wireless and
   cellular networks. Although cooperative communication provides
   significant benefits, it also raises a number of serious security issues
   as malicious nodes may impersonate and affect the integrity of the
   communication. In this paper, we propose a prevention-based security
   technique for cooperative communication taking into consideration
   authentication protocol, based on hash chains and Merkle trees, along
   with physical layer parameters which relate to the channel state
   information. Based on this consideration, we derive the closed-form
   secured throughput equations for proactive relay selection in
   cooperative communication that provides both hop-by-hop and end-to-end
   authentication and integrity protection. The simulation results show
   that our proposed solution, which provides authentication and protects
   data integrity, has a higher throughput performance when compared to
   existing schemes that do not consider security. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a dynamic model representing the temporal

   objective functional based on energy demand, production of pollution
   associated with usage of fossil fuels, and the cost of their systematic
   substitution by renewable sources. Pontryagin minimum principle is used
   to determine optimal control policy through minimizing energy generation
   from fossil fuels while meeting the energy demand as closely as possible
   through gradual replacement of nonrenewable sources by renewable ones.
   For different choices of plan periods, optimal generation path along
   with the corresponding control policies are presented. These results

Abstract = {{The effects of using untreated leachate for supplemental water addition
   and liquid recirculation on anaerobic digestion of food waste was
   evaluated by combining cyclic water recycle operations with batch
   mesophilic biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays. Cyclic BMP assays
   indicated that using an appropriate fraction of recycled leachate and
   fresh make up water can stimulate methanogenic activity and enhance
   biogas production. Conversely increasing the percentage of recycled
   leachate in the make up water eventually causes methanogenic inhibition
   and decrease in the rate of food waste stabilization. The decrease in
   activity is exacerbated as the number cycles increases. Inhibition is
   possibly attributed to accumulation and elevated concentrations of
   ammonia as well as other waste by products in the recycled leachate that
   inhibit methanogenesis. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{E-Health systems, through their use of Internet and wireless
   technologies, offer the possibility of near real-time data integration
   to support the delivery and management of health care. In practice, the
   wide range of choice in technologies, vendors, protocols, formats, and
   information representations can make even simple exchanges of
   information between systems problematic. Much of the focus on healthcare
   interoperability has been on resolving interoperability issues of system
   to system information exchanges. But issues around people to people
   interactions and people to system interactions are just as important to
   address from an interoperability point of view. In this paper, we
   identify interoperability deficiencies in collaborative care delivery
   and develop a methodology in two parts. In the first part, an ontology
   is developed to represent collaborative care delivery. In the second
   part, the ontology is used to design an architecture for interoperable
   clinical information system design. We then use a case study in
   palliative care to provide a proof of concept of the methodology. The
   case study provides an inventory of the interoperability requirements
   for palliative care and a perspective on the design and implementation
   of a people oriented clinical information system that supports
   collaborative health care delivery in palliative care.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the design and development of a class of new
   composite materials, which are low-carbon Stellite alloy matrices
   reinforced with carbon fibers. The focus of the research is to compare
   the different effects of carbon fibers versus carbides on Stellite

   carbon content (0.1 wt.\%), thus minimal carbide volume fraction. The
   composite specimens are fabricated using the hot isostatic pressing and
   sintering techniques. The microstructures of the specimens are examined
   with optical microscopy in order to identify the possible carbide
   formation from the carbon fibers. The material characterization of the
   specimens is achieved through hardness test, sliding wear test and
   corrosion test. These novel materials exhibit superior properties
   compared to existing Stellite alloys and are expected to spawn a new
   generation of materials used for high temperature, severe corrosion, and
   wear resistant applications in various industries. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Navigating novel biological routes to mitigate biofouling is of great
   worth inorder to allow sustainable performance of Membrane Bioreactors
   (MBRs) in wastewater treatment technology. Recently, it was confirmed
   that a number of natural compounds in plants have an anti-biofouling
   effect, reducing the formation of biofilm. This study addressed the
   feasibility of Piper betle extract (PBE) as anti-biofouling agent
   against the model organism Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and bacterial
   consortium. The anti-biofouling effects of PBE were evaluated via a
   microtiter plate assay; changes in the growth rate (mu) and EPS
   production. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) was employed to
   qualitatively illustrate the biofilm formation. PBE revealed >= 80\%
   reduction in biofilm formation, growth rate (87\%) and reduced the EPS
   production. These results suggest that PBE could be a potential agent
   for the mitigation of membrane biofouling. However, the chemical
   stability, potential toxicity and consistent performance of PBE in the
   field will have to be further investigated for optimization of its use
   on a field scale. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Planning}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{To avoid huge data loss in the last mile of Internet service, Passive
   Optical Networks (PONs) need to be designed with a high availability
   guarantee. Because next generation PON includes extending the coverage
   of optical broadband access networks under the name long-reach PON,
   availability-guaranteed planning of PONs for long-reach access is
   required. In this paper, we propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
   (MILP)-based approach, and a heuristic algorithm, for the planning of
   survivable long-reach passive optical networks. The MILP-based planning
   model mainly consists of cost and availability constraints, while having
   the objective of largest possible area coverage. The heuristic is called
   Locate-ONU-with-Lowest-Availability-Requirement-First (LOWLARF), and it
   performs a faster search for the nearly optimal locations of Optical
   Network Units (ONUs), Optical Line Terminal (OLT), and the optical
   splitter having the same objective and constraints with the MILP model.
   The proposed heuristic and the MILP model are compared in terms of the
   solution spaces provided for a small sized problem. The heuristic
   LOWLARF introduces the advantage of significantly degraded running time,
   and numerical results indicate that it can provide close results to
   those of the MILP-based planning. On the other hand, three survivability
   schemes are compared in terms of deployment cost, availability, and
   coverage by MILP-based planning and LOWLARF. The evaluation is done by
   two different availability requirement scenarios. The results show that,
   under both scenarios, the protection scheme offering a lower bound of
   99.999\% availability leads to the highest deployment cost while it
   covers the smallest area. The protection schemes that guarantee 99.99\%
   availability by employing less redundancy can cover a larger area under
   both scenarios.}},

   Mechanism of electrical transport is done below room temperature (77-300
   K) in presence and absence of magnetic field up to 1 T. Samples are
   following both one dimensional Mott's variable range hopping and
   tunneling theory. Forward interference model is used to explain the
   mechanism of magnetic field dependent conductivity. The real part of AC
   conductivity follows universal dielectric response sigma'(f)
   proportional to f(s) . The universal dielectric response parameter s
   varies with temperature according to correlated barrier hopping model.
   The variation of real part of complex impedance with frequency can be
   described in terms of Maxwell Wagner effect. The positive variation of

Abstract = {{Currently, electrospun nanofibrous membrane (ENM) is classified as a
   microfiltration (MF) membrane, which upon further modification is used
   for nanofiltration (NF) applications. The objective of this study was to
   investigate the suitability of ENM for water treatment applications.
   Different fiber sizes were obtained by varying the concentration of
   polyacrylonitrile solution (namely 4, 6, 8 and 10 wt\%) to explore the
   interplay between electrospun fiber size and rejected salt ions. When
   the fiber size was larger, its `bubble-point' was higher and hence its
   pure water flux was also higher. In order to transform these MF membrane
   to NF membrane, an interfacial polymerization technique was used to coat
   a thin film on the surface of ENM. Separation of 2000 ppm of various
   salts was conducted on this developed thin film nanofibrous composite
   (TFNC) membrane. The results indicated that as the fiber size decreased,
   the pore-size also decreased, and the separation of salts increased,
   while at the expense of flux. When the cross-sectional thickness of the
   electrospun layer was decreased together with smaller pore-size, it
   resulted in the increased flux with high salt rejection. In addition,
   rejection efficiency of these TFNC membranes against PEG 300, PEG 600
   and PEG 3400 were also studied. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Abstract = {{A multimedia surveillance system aims to provide security and safety of
   people in a monitored space. However, due to the nature of surveillance,
   privacy-sensitive information such as face, gait, and other physical
   parameters based on the captured media from multiple sensors, can be
   revealed without the permission of the people who appear in the
   surveillance video. This is a major concern in recent days. Therefore,
   it is desirable to have such mechanism that can hide privacy-sensitive
   information as much as possible, yet supporting effective surveillance
   tasks. In this article, we propose a chaos cryptography based data
   scrambling approach that can be applied on selected regions of interest
   (ROIs) in video camera footage, which contains privacy-sensitive data.
   Our approach also supports multiple levels of abstraction of data hiding
   depending on the role of the authorized user. In order to evaluate the
   suitability of this approach, we applied our algorithm on some video
   camera footage and observed that our approach is computationally
   efficient and, hence, it can be applied for real-time video surveillance
   tasks in preserving privacy sensitive information.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate automatic noninvasive assessment of blood pressure (BP)
   presents a challenge due to conditions like arrhythmias, obesity, and
   postural changes that tend to obfuscate arterial amplitude pulsations
   sensed by the cuff. Researchers tried to overcome this challenge by
   analyzing oscillometric pulses with the aid of a higher fidelity
   signal-the electrocardiogram (ECG). Moreover, pulse transit time (PTT)
   was employed to provide an additional method for BP estimation. However,
   these methods were not fully developed, suitably integrated, or tested.
   To address these issues, we present a novel method whereby ECG-assisted
   oscillometric and PTT (measured between ECG R-peaks and maximum slope of
   arterial pulse peaks) analyses are seamlessly integrated into the
   oscillometric BP measurement paradigm. The method bolsters oscillometric
   analysis (amplitude modulation) with more reliable ECG R-peaks provides
   a complementary measure with PTT analysis (temporal modulation) and
   fuses this information for robust BP estimation. We have integrated this
   technology into a prototype that comprises a BP cuff with an embedded
   conductive fabric ECG electrode, associated hardware, and algorithms. A
   pilot study has been undertaken on ten healthy subjects (150 recordings)
   to validate the performance of our prototype against United States Food
   and Drug Administration approved Omron oscillometric monitor
   (HEM-790IT). Our prototype achieves mean absolute difference of less
   than 5 mmHg and grade A as per the British Hypertension Society protocol
   for estimating BP, with the reference Omron monitor.}},

Abstract = {{Flood quantiles are routinely used in hydrologic engineering to design
   hydraulic structures, optimize erosion control structure and map the
   extent of floodplains. As an increasing number of papers are pointing
   out cycles and trends in hydrologic time series, the use of stationary
   flood distributions leads to the overestimation or underestimation of
   the hydrologic risk at a given time. Several authors tried to address
   this problem by using probability distributions with time-varying
   parameters. The parameters of these distributions were assumed to follow
   a linear or quadratic trend in time, which may be valid for the short
   term but may lead to unrealistic long-term projections. On the other
   hand, deterministic rainfall-runoff models are able to successfully
   reproduce trends and cycles in stream flow data but can perform poorly
   in reproducing daily flows and flood peaks. Rainfall-runoff models
   typically have a better performance when simulation results are
   aggregated at a larger time scale (e.g. at a monthly time scale vs. at a
   daily time scale). The strengths of these two approaches are combined in
   this paper where the annual maximum of the time-averaged outputs of a
   hydrologic model are used to modulate the parameters of a non-stationary
   GEV model of the daily maximum flow. The method was applied to the
   Kemptville Creek located in Ontario, Canada, using the SWAT (Soil and
   Water Assessment Tool) model as rainfall-runoff model. The parameters of
   the non-stationary GEV model are then estimated using Monte Carlo Markov
   Chain, and the optimal span of the time windows over which the SWAT
   outputs were averaged was selected using Bayes factors. Results show
   that using the non-stationary GEV distribution with a location parameter
   linked to the maximum 9-day average flow provides a much better
   estimation of flood quantiles than applying a stationary frequency
   analysis to the simulated peak flows.}},

Abstract = {{This paper identifies a widely existing phenomenon in social media
   content, which we call the ``words of few mouths{''} phenomenon. This
   phenomenon challenges the development of recommender systems based on
   users' online opinions by presenting additional sources of uncertainty.
   In the context of predicting the ``helpfulness{''} of a review document
   based on users' online votes on other reviews (where a user's vote on a
   review is either HELPFUL or UNHELPFUL), the ``words of few mouths{''}
   phenomenon corresponds to the case where a large fraction of the reviews
   are each voted only by very few users. Focusing on the ``review
   helpfulness prediction{''} problem, we illustrate the challenges
   associated with the ``words of few mouths{''} phenomenon in the training
   of a review helpfulness predictor. We advocate probabilistic approaches
   for recommender system development in the presence of ``words of few
   mouths{''}. More concretely, we propose a probabilistic metric as the
   training target for conventional machine learning based predictors. Our
   empirical study using Support Vector Regression (SVR) augmented with the
   proposed probability metric demonstrates advantages of incorporating
   probabilistic methods in the training of the predictors. In addition to
   this ``partially probabilistic{''} approach, we also develop a logistic
   regression based probabilistic model and correspondingly a learning
   algorithm for review helpfulness prediction. We demonstrate
   experimentally the superior performance of the logistic regression
   method over SVR, the prior art in review helpfulness prediction.}},

Abstract = {{We study reconfigurations of wavelength-routed Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM) networks in response to lightpath demand changes,
   with the objective of servicing more lightpath demands without
   additional network resources from a long-term network operation point of
   view. For the reconfiguration problem under study, we assume WDM network
   operators are provided with lightpath demands in batches. With limited
   network resources, our problem has two unique challenges: balancing
   network resource allocations between current and future lightpath
   demands, and modeling future lightpath demands. The first challenge
   implies making tradeoffs between accepting as many current immediate
   lightpath demands as possible and reserving a certain amount of network
   resources for near future predicted lightpath demands. The second
   challenge implies modeling future predicted lightpath demands, which are
   not exactly known or certain as the current lightpath demands. Our
   proposed model allows a natural separation between the operation of the
   optical layer and the user traffic layer (predominantly the IP-layer),
   while supporting their interactions, for which we propose a new
   formulation for per-link congestion control, associated with a
   mathematical solution procedure. Our simulation results reveal that by
   properly controlling resource allocations in the current session using
   our proposed mechanism, rejections in future sessions are greatly

Abstract = {{In recent years, social Web users have been overwhelmed by the huge
   numbers of social media available. Consequentially, users have trouble
   finding social media suited to their needs. To help such users retrieve
   useful social media content, we propose a new model of tag-based
   personalized searches to enhance not only retrieval accuracy but also
   retrieval coverage. By leveraging social tagging as a preference
   indicator, we build two models: (i) a latent tag preference model that
   reflects how a certain user has assigned tags similar to a given tag and
   (ii) a latent tag annotation model that captures how users have tagged a
   certain tag to resources similar to a given resource. We then seamlessly
   map the tags onto items, depending on an individual user's query, to
   find the most desirable content relevant to the user's needs.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
   outperforms the state-of-the art algorithms and show our method's
   feasibility for personalized searches in social media services. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Porous asymmetric polysulfone (PSf) hollow fiber membranes were
   fabricated via wet spinning process. A mixture of 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidone
   (NMP) and distilled water (90 wt.\% NMP) was used as bore fluid to make
   hollow fiber membranes without inner skin layers, whereas glycerol with
   2 and 4 wt.\% was used as additives to the spinning dope. The effect of
   the additives concentration on the structure, surface porosity, pore
   size, critical water entry pressure (CEPw), and CO2 absorption flux of
   the fabricated membranes were investigated. The cross-section and inner
   surface of the membranes were examined via scanning electronic
   microscopy (SEM). Using glycerol as the additive in the spinning dope
   provided the membrane structure with a thin finger-like and a thick
   sponge-like layer, which resulted in a high CEPw and CO2 absorption
   rate. Results of gas permeation tests showed with increasing glycerol
   concentration the N-2 permeance increase significantly and the wetting
   resistance decrease slightly. CO2 absorption by distilled water was
   conducted through the gas-liquid membrane contactors. By using 4\%
   glycerol in the spinning dope, the PSf membrane showed a CO2 flux of
   approximately 57\% higher than the PSf membrane with 2\% glycerol at the
   absorbent flow rate of 200 ml/min. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Landfill leachate (LFL), especially old LFL, is very difficult to treat
   using conventional biological processes. To this end, membrane
   bioreactor (MBR) has proven to be a promising alternative. The membrane
   separation capacity of a MBR allows the retention of most microbial
   cells in the reactor to maintain a high biomass concentration, resulting
   in an efficient biological digestion system. As a result, excellent
   biological oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonia removals of 90\% or higher
   are achievable with a much shorter hydraulic residence time (HRT) and
   much larger organic loading rate (OLR) in comparison to conventional
   biological systems. MBR also allows excellent chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) removal (75\% or higher), even with old LFL under optimized
   conditions. MBRs have also been demonstrated to be effective in the
   removal of micropollutants. Furthermore, recent developments such as
   anaerobic MBR and PAC (powdered activated carbon)-amended MBR have shown
   great potentials in LFL treatment. MBRs can provide stable performance
   while accommodating large variations in composition of influents and
   other operation conditions. However, short HRT and high ammonia
   concentration were found to have adverse effects. Extremely long solids
   residence time was also found to lower MBR performance. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{Removal of volatile organic compound (chloroform) from water was carried

   feasible. The overall mass transfer coefficient of chloroform through
   the nanofiber membrane was found to be 2 x 10(-5) m/s at room
   temperature, which was more than the highest value obtained earlier for
   a hollow fiber air-stripping system. The activation energy of the mass
   transfer coefficient was almost the same as that of the Henry constant
   for chloroform absorption in water. It was therefore concluded that the
   chloroform desorption from water was the governing factor of the system.

Abstract = {{Time lag method is a widely used technique in constant volume systems
   for the determination of the diffusion and permeability coefficients of
   gasses in membrane. This technique relies on the assumption that there
   is no resistance to gas transport downstream from the membrane, which
   very often might not be the case. To recover the permeability and
   diffusion coefficients, it is necessary to accurately model the
   position-dependent resistance effects. The resistance to gas
   accumulation was modeled in a generalized multi-tank receiver of a
   constant volume system, by solving Fick's 2nd law of diffusion, which
   served as a governing partial differential equation, in each tube of the
   receiver. The diffusion coefficient appearing in each partial
   differential equation was evaluated using the empirical model of
   Knudsen, which allowed investigating the effect of transition from
   Knudsen to the slip flow regime on membrane characterization. The
   validity of the developed model was verified by comparison of the
   reconciled membrane properties from the data obtained in a high
   resistance receiver with the experimental membrane properties determined
   in a specially designed low resistance receiver. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membranes were modified using L2MM, a new
   type of hydrophilic polyurethane additive, to improve membrane
   performance. Membranes were prepared using 15 and 18\%PVDF and small
   weight percentages (i.e., 1.5 and 3\%) of L2MM. Their fouling resistance
   was evaluated by filtration/ fouling tests with Ottawa River Water (ORW)
   using membranes incorporating two different types of L2MMs
   (L2MM(PEG-200) and L2MM(PEG-600)). For comparisons a commercial membrane
   (HFM-180) was also tested. A PVDF membrane prepared with 3\%
   L2MM(PEG-200) which produced the highest cumulative permeate volume, had
   a lower flux reduction and its TOC removal was 24\% higher than the
   HEM-180 membrane. L2MM produced more hydrophilic PVDF membranes which
   had pure water permeation (PWP) rates up to 128\% greater than the
   control PVDF membranes. Many of the L2MM blended membranes had
   significantly higher total organic carbon (TOC) removals than the
   HEM-180 membrane tested (64-67\% versus 46\%). Modeling of the flux
   decline suggested the membranes fouled via a combination of pore
   blocking and cake filtration: scanning electron microscopy (SEM) of the
   fouled membrane surface confirmed the existence of a cake layer. (C)

Abstract = {{Popular polymers such as polysulfone and poly(vinylidene fluoride)
   (PVDF) when electrospun into a membrane, have a much higher contact
   angle and hence are more hydrophobic when compared to the virgin
   polymeric material. In direct liquid penetration it is more beneficial
   if the membrane is hydrophilic so that the flux is not compromised and
   has less tendency to foul. Hence, this research is focused on generating
   a highly hydrophilic electrospun membrane (EM) based on PVDF material by
   blending this polymer with several different types of surface modifying
   macromolecules (SMMs) prepared from urethane pre-polymer with
   poly(ethylene glycol)s (PEGs) of various average molecular weights (400,
   600, and 1000 Da) and poly(propylene glycol) of average molecular
   weights 3500 and 425 Da. One of the SMMs, with PEG 1000 Da, had a
   significant impact on the hydrophilic nature (0 degrees SCA with water)
   of the EM as compared to the blend casted membrane. This could possibly
   be due to the orientation of the SMMs hydrophilic groups adopted during
   electrospinning on the surface, whereas they are either encapsulated or
   submerged in other SMMs. The water flux at a given pressure of blended
   EM was higher than the non-blended electrospun PVDF membrane. This study
   highlights the potential benefits of this new hydrophilic polymeric
   material in the membrane field, which can achieve high-flux rates at low
   pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We propose and experimentally demonstrate a photonic approach to the
   measurement of the time-difference-of-arrival (TDOA) and the
   angle-of-arrival (AOA) of a microwave signal. In the proposed system,
   the TDOA and the AOA are equivalently converted into a phase shift
   between two replicas of a microwave signal received at two cascaded
   modulators. The light wave from a CW laser is externally modulated by
   the microwave signal at the first modulator, which is biased to suppress
   the optical carrier, leading to the generation of two first-order
   side-bands, which are further modulated by the phase-delayed microwave
   signal at the second modulator. Two optical components at the carrier
   wavelength are generated. The total power at the carrier wavelength is a
   function of the phase shift due to the coherent interference between the
   two components. Thus, by measuring the optical power, the phase shift is
   estimated. The AOA is calculated from the measured phase shifts. In our
   experiment, the phase shift of a microwave signal at 18 GHz from -160
   degrees to 40 degrees is measured with measurement errors of less than
   +/- 2.5 degrees. (C) 2012 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Automatic container-code recognition is of great importance to the
   modern container management system. Similar techniques have been
   proposed for vehicle license plate recognition in past decades. Compared
   with license plate recognition, automatic container-code recognition
   faces more challenges due to the severity of nonuniform illumination and
   invalidation of color information. In this paper, a computer vision
   based container-code recognition technique is proposed. The system
   consists of three function modules, namely location, isolation, and
   character recognition. In location module, we propose a text-line region
   location algorithm, which takes into account the characteristics of
   single character as well as the spatial relationship between successive
   characters. This module locates the text-line regions by using a
   horizontal high-pass filter and scanline analysis. To resolve nonuniform
   illumination, a two-step procedure is applied to segment container-code
   characters, and a projection process is adopted to isolate characters in
   the isolation module. In character recognition module, the character
   recognition is achieved by classifying the extracted features, which
   represent the character image, with trained support vector machines
   (SVMs). The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and
   effectiveness of the proposed technique for practical usage. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{In an infrastructure-less wireless ad hoc or sensor network,
   communication may be achieved between mobile nodes without a central
   entity (base station) using a half-duplex Slotted ALOHA protocol. The
   probability of success and the throughput per mobile node can be reduced
   significantly, if the network is attacked by jamming signals. Mitigating
   the effect of jamming signals using multi-packet transmission (MPT)
   and/or multi-packet reception (MPR) capabilities of each mobile node is
   studied. The effect of the probability of success reduction due to
   jamming signals can be mitigated by using the MPT and the MPR
   capabilities of each mobile node. Similarly, reduced throughput can be
   increased using the same techniques. The maximum throughput per mobile
   node can be obtained by the proper adjustment of the transmitting
   probability of each mobile node and the receiving probability of each
   mobile node. A lower mitigation of the maximum throughput reduction can
   be obtained by using only the MPT, if the jamming signal rate is very
   low. On the other hand, only the MPR capability can provide a lower
   mitigation of the maximum throughput reduction. The effect of jamming
   signals on the maximum throughput can be mitigated successfully at all
   traffic load conditions, if the MPT and the MPR capabilities work
   together.}},

Abstract = {{Concentration and temperature profiles for CO2 adsorption from a CO2-N-2
   gas mixture (10\% CO2 by vol in N-2) have been studied in a dynamic
   adsorption pilot plant unit to better understand the breakthrough
   behaviour. The scope of the present work is to study the adsorption
   characteristics and heat effects of this CO2-N-2 gas mixture and to
   develop a simple model for the dynamic simulation of non-isothermal
   adsorption in a fixed bed.
   Results indicated that adsorption heat effects were significant for this
   mixture while the breakthrough time obtained with Ceca 13X adsorbent was
   independent of the initial bed temperature. The cooling step that
   follows the thermal regeneration of the adsorption bed could be omitted
   entirely without affecting the adsorption performance. An earlier
   breakthrough time was observed for a higher feed flow rate of 6.6 SL/min
   compared to 4 SL/min. Cooling during the adsorption cycle decreased the
   width of the mass transfer zone and led to a longer breakthrough time.
   The study also indicated that online measurements of temperature at
   different locations along the column bed could be used to predict the
   concentration breakthrough for this CO2-N-2 gas mixture. The novel
   two-population model used in this study provided an adequate
   representation of the temperature and concentration breakthrough
   profiles within the adsorption column. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Flow and turbulence redistribution in a straight artificial pool}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{FEB 2}},
Abstract = {{Multiple hypotheses have been advanced to explain the occurrence of
   pools in gravel bed rivers. These hypotheses were developed without a
   hydrodynamic model of how open channel flow is affected by pools, and it
   is not clear why and when the flow phenomena they describe might occur.
   Laboratory experiments are warranted to improve our understanding of how
   a gradual convective deceleration and acceleration of the flow, without
   flow separation, redistributes flow and turbulence in an open channel.
   Experiments are conducted in a 1.5 m wide flume with a 0.25 m deep, 7.29
   m long straight pool, entry and exit slopes of 5 degrees, vertical side
   walls, and gravel sediment (D-50 = 9.9 mm). Three-dimensional velocity
   components are recorded at 50 Hz using Nortek Vectrinos. Velocity and
   Reynolds stress profiles in the channel centerline agree with previous
   results in nonuniform flow and include increased Reynolds stress during
   deceleration and high velocity near the bed during acceleration. Lateral
   flow convergence occurs where depth is increasing, which demonstrates
   that convergence is induced during flow deceleration and does not
   require a lateral flow constriction. Turbulence during deceleration is
   characterized by sweeps angled toward the sidewall of the channel, an
   effect that could lead to the formation of a nonuniform pool depth
   through lateral gradients in the deposition of mobile sediment. A
   conceptual model of pool hydrodynamics is proposed that includes
   increased turbulence, near-bed acceleration, and lateral flow
   convergence as linked aspects of convective deceleration and
   acceleration due to depth changes in the pool.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to map a state-space continuous-time

   the discrete model can approximate the continuous one to an arbitrary

   that the constructed discrete model is guaranteed stable, where it can
   be run in an A-stable or L-stable mode, depending on the application or
   user's preference. The proposed mapping method is based on the
   single-step Obreshkov integration formulas that were proposed to solve
   ordinary differential equations. Preliminary performance experiments
   show superior accuracy compared to traditional discretization methods
   such as the Tustin method. Application of the proposed method to the
   discretization of analog filters demonstrates a significant accuracy in
   matching both of the magnitude and phase of the frequency response of
   the continuous system.}},

Abstract = {{Sequence Alignment is a. basic operation in Bioinformatics that is
   performed thousands of times, on daily basis. The exact methods for
   pairwise alignment have quadratic time complexity. For this reason,
   heuristic methods such as BLAST are widely used. To obtain exact results
   faster, parallel strategies have been proposed but most of them fail to
   align huge biological sequences. This happens because not only the
   quadratic time must be considered but also the space should be reduced.
   In this paper, we evaluate the performance of Z-align, a parallel exact
   strategy that runs in user-restricted memory space. Also, we propose and
   evaluate a tunable work distribution mechanism. The results obtained in
   two clusters show that two sequences of size 24MBP (Mega Base Pairs) and
   23MBP, respectively, were successfully aligned with Z-align. Also, in
   order to align two 3MBP sequences, a speedup of 34.35 was achieved for
   64 processors. The evaluation of our work distribution mechanism shows
   that the execution times can be sensibly reduced when appropriate
   parameters are chosen. Finally, when comparing Z-align with BLAST, it is
   clear that, in many cases, Z-align is able to produce alignments with
   higher score.}},

Abstract = {{As is known, zinc pollution has been a public environmental issue for a
   long time. Accordingly, the major objective of this study is to examine
   the effect of activated Firmiana simplex leaf on Zn(II) removal from
   aqueous solution. The result shows that activated Firmiana simplex leaf
   can remove Zn(II) effectively at 250 degrees C due to the preservation
   of amine, carboxyl, and phosphate groups. Several factors were
   determined to have significant effects on the adsorption of Zn(II),
   including the adsorbent component, dosage, initial concentration,
   solution pH, temperature, and duration. Pseudo first order and pseudo
   second order kinetics equations were used to predict the kinetic and
   thermodynamic constants that reveal the endothermic and spontaneous
   nature of the adsorption. Using the Langmuir model, the maximum zinc
   adsorption capacity was calculated to be 55.096 mg/g, which was
   subsequently confirmed by Fourier transformed infrared radiation (FT-IR)
   analyses and X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra. DOI:

Abstract = {{Despite much experience that low-rise wood buildings are vulnerable to
   damage by extreme wind events, few such structures have been tested in
   fullsize to understand how they respond to wind loads as a whole system.
   This paper presents a study that measured internal force flows
   throughout the framing of a typical North American single-story
   structure with platform construction. Applied forces were concentrated
   horizontal loads normal to walls and patches of gravity loads on the
   sloped roof. Two series of load cells were embedded into the system,
   between the roof trusses and supporting walls and between the floor
   platform and the foundation. It was observed that even localized
   external forces have effects that propagate through the entire system.
   For instance, horizontal loads applied near eave level or to the roof
   were reacted at the top of the foundation around the entire wall
   perimeter of the building footprint, both parallel and transverse to the
   applied loading. For vertical loads, measurements showed that systemic
   effects dominate the response. Observed three-dimensional behavior stems
   from the relatively stiff interconnection of roof, wall, and floor
   platform substructures. DOI:10.1061/(ASCE)ST.1943541X.0000439. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional, unsteady simulations of developing turbulent flows in
   a rectangular channel containing a cylindrical rod have been performed
   to investigate their sensitivity to the choices of boundary conditions
   and turbulence models. Among all methods, large eddy simulations,
   employed in a downstream sub-domain of the channel as part of the
   segregated hybrid model, reproduced most accurately the experimental
   results. However, unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS)
   simulations with a Reynolds stress model appear to be also an acceptable
   choice for approximate rod bundle analyses, making fairly accurate
   predictions at a much lower computational cost. In agreement with
   previous findings, steady RANS simulations are not recommended as a
   low-cost substitute of URANS for flows in tightly packed rod bundles.
   The URANS simulations were found to be insensitive to inlet turbulence
   specification and to be more accurate when a uniform inlet velocity was
   specified rather than a fully developed inlet velocity distribution.
   Developing flow simulations were found to be preferable to simulations
   with a streamwise-periodic boundary condition. Finally, unsteady
   inviscid (Euler) simulations with a fully developed initial velocity
   distribution predicted the onset of gap instability, but were otherwise
   found to be unsuitable for practical analysis of rod bundle flows. (C)

Abstract = {{Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) ultrafiltration membranes were modified
   using a new type of hydrophilic polyurethane additive, called L2MM.
   During phase inversion L2MM migrates to the membrane surface and
   functions as both a pore former and surface modifier. L2MM improved the
   surface hydrophilicity and significantly increased the PVDF membrane's
   pure water permeation (PWP) rate. PVDF membranes were modified with two
   L2MMs: L2MM(PEG-600) and L2MM(PEG-200). PWP tests, contact angle
   measurements, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to assess
   the impact of L2MM type, L2MM concentration and PVDF concentration on
   the performance and characteristics of modified PVDF membranes. XPS
   analysis and contact angle measurements indicated that the L2MM migrated
   to the membrane surface and the contact angle decreased by up to 19\%.
   SEM and AFM images were used to investigate the relation between surface
   morphology and ultimate performance. The L2MMs had a significant effect
   on flux; increasing the L2MM concentration improved membrane PWP fluxes
   up to a maximum with further increases resulting in flux decreases. Both
   L2MM(PEG-200) and L2MM(PEG-600) increased the final PWP flux of modified
   PVDF membranes up to 6.5 times that of the control membranes.
   Furthermore, L2MM(PEG-200) increased the 100 kDa polyethylene oxide
   (PEO) separation from 88 to 96\% compared to the control membrane. (C)

Volume = {{22}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Multiple description coding (MDC) is a technique where multiple streams
   from a source video are generated, each individually decodable and
   mutually refinable. MDC is a promising solution to overcome packet loss
   in video transmission over noisy channels, particularly for real-time
   applications in which retransmission of lost information is not
   practical. A problem with conventional MDC is that the achieved side
   distortion quality is considerably lower than single description coding
   (SDC) quality except at high redundancies which in turn leads to central
   quality degradation. In this paper, a new mixed layer MDC scheme is
   presented with no degradation in central quality, and providing better
   side quality (approximately as much as that of SDC) compared to
   conventional methods. Also, this property directly leads to higher
   average quality when delivering the video in lossy networks. For each
   discrete cosine transform coefficient, we generate two coefficients:
   base coefficient (BC) and enhancement coefficient which are combined
   together. When all descriptions are available, they are decomposed and
   decoded to achieve high quality video. When one description is not
   available, we use estimation to extract as much of the BC as possible
   from the received description. Simulation results show that the proposed
   scheme leads to an improved redundancy-rate-distortion performance
   compared to conventional methods. The algorithm is implemented in JM16.0
   and its performance for two-description and four-description coding is
   verified by experiments.}},

   two-terminal mass device}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS \& STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Much effort has been devoted to developing variable stiffness and
   variable damping devices for semi-active structural vibration control.
   However, little research has been done for variable inertial mass mainly
   caused by the mechanical terminal limit of the mass component. Based on
   the two-terminal mass scheme, we propose an electro-hydraulic approach
   to realizing a novel device with variable two-terminal mass. In this
   study, the flywheel that is traditionally handled by one physical
   terminal is manipulated by two terminals of a hydraulic
   cylinder-control-motor system. The transmission ratio of the system is
   adjusted using an electro-hydraulic proportional valve. Through modeling
   the ideal dynamic behavior, it is confirmed that the equivalent inertial
   mass between two terminals of the component can be made variable. To
   further understand its mechanical characteristics, a prototype device is
   developed and tested on a test rig. Triangular and sinusoidal excitation
   signals are employed respectively to identify the model parameters. The
   results show that the proposed model can describe the dynamic
   characteristics of the variable two-terminal mass device well. The
   proposed design and modeling schemes pave the way towards the
   semi-active variable inertial mass control of vibration systems.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the heterogeneity involved in smart interconnected devices,
   cellular applications, and surrounding (GPS-aware) environments there is
   a need to develop a realistic approach to track mobile assets. Current
   tracking systems are costly and inefficient over wireless data

   Our aim is to develop an efficient and improved geographical asset
   tracking solution and conserve valuable mobile resources by dynamically
   adapting the tracking scheme by means of context-aware personalized
   route learning techniques. We intend to perform this tracking by
   proactively monitoring the context information in a distributed,
   efficient, and scalable fashion. Context profiles, which indicate the
   characteristics of a route based on environmental conditions, are
   utilized to dynamically represent the values of the asset's properties.
   We designed and implemented an adaptive learning based scheme that makes
   an optimized judgment of data transmission. This manuscript is
   complemented with theoretical and practical evaluations that prove that
   significant costs can be saved and operational efficiency can be

Abstract = {{After analyzing the shortcomings of current feature extraction and fault
   diagnosis technologies, a new approach based on wavelet packet
   decomposition (WPD) and empirical mode decomposition (EMD) are combined
   to extract fault feature frequency and neural network for rotating
   machinery early fault diagnosis is proposed. Acquisition signals with
   fault frequency feature are decomposed into a series of narrow bandwidth
   using WPD method for de-noising, then, the intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs), which usually denoted the features of corresponding frequency
   bandwidth can be obtained by applying EMD method. Thus, the component of
   IMF with signal feature can be separated from all IMFs and the energy
   moment of IMFs is proposed as eigenvector to effectively express the
   failure feature. The classical three layers BP neural network model
   taking the fault feature frequency as target input of neural network,
   the 5 spectral bandwidth energy of vibration signal spectrum as
   characteristic parameter, and the 10 types of representative rotor fault
   as output can be established to identify the fault pattern of a machine.
   Lastly, the fault identification model of rotating machinery with rotor
   lateral early crack based on BP neural network is taken as an example.
   The results show that the proposed method can effectively get the signal
   feature to diagnose the occurrence of early fault of rotating machinery.

Title = {{Effects of steam on the sulfation of limestone and NOx formation in an
   air- and oxy-fired pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed combustor}},

Abstract = {{The existing fluidized bed combustion literature on sulfation shows that
   above 30\% conversion, direct sulfation via reaction with CaCO3 is
   faster than indirect sulfation with CaO. However, while this is true for
   dry flue gases, it is not the case if steam (H2O(g)) is present at
   realistic levels for coal combustion, and it has been confirmed by
   experiments employing thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and tube furnace
   (TF) testing that direct sulfation is in fact slower than indirect
   sulfation for nearly all levels of conversion if steam (H2O(g)) is
   present. In this work we have also examined the effects of H2O(g) on SO2
   capture and NH3 oxidation to NOx over calcium-containing compounds under
   air-and oxy-fired conditions in a pilot-scale circulating fluidized bed
   combustor (CFBC) utilizing limestone addition. The results of the
   pilot-scale tests confirm suggestions from our previous work that sulfur
   capture from the air firing of low-moisture fuels benefits from
   steam-sulfation. For petroleum coke, the addition of 8\% vol H2O(g)
   resulted in increased SO2 retention and Ca utilization, as well as
   decreased NOx emissions by up to 44\%. The simultaneous reduction of SO2
   and NOx was attributed to enhanced solid-state diffusion (sintering) by
   H2O(g). Under oxy-fuel-firing conditions, H2O(g) addition also resulted
   in decreased NOx emissions, but the pilot-scale tests showed poorer
   sulfur capture performance and calcium utilization as compared to air
   firing when H2O(g) was present, thereby reconfirming the TGA/TF results.
   It appears that most bench-scale work on sulfation to date has
   underestimated the true rate of reaction for sulfation in the presence
   of H2O(g). This conclusion explains at least in part why indirect
   sulfation is often faster than direct sulfation in pilot plant studies
   on oxy-fuel circulating fluidized bed combustion. Moreover, this work
   stresses the importance of including H2O(g) in bench-scale experiments
   that attempt to simulate real combustion environments. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{BA-15 functionalized with 3-aminopropyltrimethoxy-silane was studied as
   potential absorbent for Cd2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Al3+ and
   Cr3+. The adsorption capacity and selectivity of the materials were
   investigated in single and multi-metal solutions. Using single-metal
   solutions, the adsorbent was found to have an affinity (molar basis) for
   metal ions in decreasing order of Al3+ > cu(2+) > Ni2+ > Zn2+ > Co2+ >
   Cd2+ > Pb2+ > Cr3+. Using very dilute solutions, i.e., 10 ppm, more than
   95\% of cations were removed, except Co2+ and Cr3+, indicating the high
   sensitivity of the current adsorbent. The affinity for coexisting metal
   cations decreased in the order of Al3+ > Ni2+ > Cr3+ > Pb2+ > Zn2+ >
   Cd2+ > Co2+ > Cu2+. The adsorption capacities in multi-metal solutions
   were lower than in single-metal ones because of competition between
   metallic elements for the amine groups, with a preference for Al3+. The
   amine-modified SBA-15 adsorbent exhibited an excellent selectivity
   against sodium, potassium, and calcium, indicating that the ionic
   strength does not affect the adsorption properties. Application of this
   material to remove copper in tap water, river water, and electroplating

Volume = {{68}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 22}},
Abstract = {{Ethanol is a biofuel, produced through the fermentation of sugars
   derived from biomass. Its usefulness as a fuel is limited by the energy
   intensive nature of the ethanol separation process. The ethanol recovery
   process is inefficient due to the dilute nature of the fermentation
   product and the presence of the ethanol water azeotrope. This
   investigation presents a new hybrid separation process for energy
   efficient ethanol recovery. The new process is a hybrid of distillation
   and pervaporation. However, as opposed to most other hybrid processes,
   the distillation and pervaporation processes are combined into single
   unit. An overview of the proposed system was provided and differences to
   the conventional separation process were highlighted. A mathematical
   model was derived to explain the transport phenomena occurring in the
   hybrid process. The model was then used to compare the process to
   distillation. It was shown that the hybrid process is capable of
   breaking the ethanol-water azeotrope. It was also demonstrated that the
   pervaporation process, which is associated with both material and energy
   transfer, induces partial condensation of the vapor and thereby affects
   the efficiency of vapor liquid contacting. Simulations were presented to
   show the impact of reflux ratio and pervaporation flux on the
   performance of the process. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Fe3O4-gold-chitosan core-shell nanostructure can be used in
   biotechnological and biomedical applications such as magnetic
   bioseparation, water and wastewater treatment, biodetection and

   Results: Magnetite nanoparticles with an average size of 9.8 nm in
   diameter were synthesized using the chemical co-precipitation method. A
   gold-coated Fe3O4 monotonous core-shell nanostructure was produced with
   an average size of 15 nm in diameter by glucose reduction of Au3+ which
   is then stabilized with a chitosan cross linked by formaldehyde. The
   results of analyses with X-ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier Transformed
   Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM),
   and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) indicated that the nanoparticles were
   regularly shaped, and agglomerate-free, with a narrow size distribution.
   Conclusions: A rapid, mild method for synthesizing Fe3O4-gold
   nanoparticles using chitosan was investigated. A magnetic
   core-shell-chitosan nanocomposite, including both the supermagnetic
   properties of iron oxide and the optical characteristics of colloidal
   gold nanoparticles, was synthesized.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing is becoming a leading edge business model by migrating
   the resources such as software, storage and platform to remote locations
   in the Internet cloud. Data centers, as the main hosts of these cloud
   services, receive massive amount of demands and transmit services
   towards Internet routers, consequently consuming enormous bandwidth in
   the downstream. Due to high computing power, as well as the cooling
   power, data centers contribute to a significant amount of the power
   consumption and the operational expenditures (Opex) of the data center
   operator. In the Internet backbone where the services are transported
   between the users and the data centers, IP routers make the dominating
   portion of the power consumption and Opex associated with the network
   operator. In this paper, we study the impacts of Time of Use
   (ToU)-awareness on the Opex and energy-efficiency of the cloud network
   by introducing a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based design
   scheme for the cloud backbone, which aims at minimizing the network and
   data center power consumption. Furthermore, the optimization scheme
   takes advantage of the varying ToU rates in different locations of the
   cloud network so that Opex is minimized for the network and data center
   operators. Numerical results approve that Opex savings through ToU-aware
   provisioning are at the expense of increased delay per demand.
   Furthermore, by the end of the day, power-minimized provisioning
   introduces more savings to the network operator as upstream data center
   demands are transported towards the data centers at the off-peak
   locations, which in return leads to higher utilization of network
   components in longer routes.}},

Abstract = {{It is crucial to achieve Quality of Service (QoS) on IEEE802.11 in order
   to provide stable and reliable communication for real time and
   multimedia applications. Most of the recent QoS techniques for Ad Hoc
   Networks rely on basic QoS classifications such as Enhanced Distributed
   Channel Access (EDCA) and Hybrid Coordination Function Channel Access
   (HCCA) with stationary backoff range for specific services, without
   considering overall resource consumption and the external correlation
   among terminals. In this paper, a novel contention window adjustment QoS
   scheme, as a special case of QoS classification, is proposed for
   achieving QoS-fairness on Ad Hoc Networks. It applies dynamic automatic
   QoS assignment with low complexity by considering the restriction among
   various terminal requirements. Throughput estimation with a proportional
   relation between throughput and backoff parameters is discussed based on

Abstract = {{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is well-known for its poor
   performance over wireless networks. The main reason is the unstable
   condition of wireless networks. Previous attempts to improve TCP
   performance have been centered on techniques such as queue management,
   congestion window adjustment, delayed acknowledgement, and etc., because
   lower layers are hidden in the layered Open Systems Interconnection
   (OSI) model. With cross layer techniques, more precise data can be
   retrieved from lower layers for network condition estimation. In this
   paper, we analyze and model the factors that affect the TCP throughput
   in the lower layers. Consequently, to solve the TCP optimization
   problem, we formulate TCP performance as a Markov Decision Process
   (MDP). An extensive set of simulation experiments has been performed on
   NS-2 in order to illustrate that TCP performance can be enhanced by
   cooperatively adjusting lower layer factors.}},

Abstract = {{Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) designed to deliver seamless and

   impeccably well in wired environment. However, when introduced to
   wireless networks, TCP performance degrades significantly due to the
   unpredictable nature of wireless environment and the subsequent loss of
   packets. TCP congestion window (cwnd) is considerably reduced because of
   the ensuing congestion control mechanisms thereby affecting TCP
   performance critically. In this paper, we propose changes to improve TCP
   performance by keeping congestion window as large as possible during the
   various phases of congestion control mechanism. We evaluate the
   performance using OPNET simulations and show how it fares against the

Abstract = {{Metallic components may develop plastic deformation before in-service
   loading (pre-strain) due to manufacturing process and/or unexpected
   loading. This pre-strain not only affects the yield strength of the
   material but also influences its fracture properties. The work presented
   here employed laser drilled model materials to better understand the
   effect of pre-strain on ductile fracture in aluminum alloy 5052. The
   micronsize laser drilled holes mimic voids forming during ductile
   fracture. These laser holes are introduced after the material has been
   pulled in tension to various amounts of pre-strain. The effect of
   pre-strain on void growth and linkage leading to fracture is studied. A
   non-local damage is used in a finite element model to predict linkage
   between voids. This non-local damage has only two adjustable parameters,
   namely the local failure strain in uniaxial tension and the
   characteristic length L which intervenes in the non-local averaging
   scheme. The precise arrangement of the laser holes can be exactly
   reproduced in the finite element model which allows the model to be
   validated with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the TCP's congestion control mechanism
   effectiveness for smart meters. We show that the classic congestion
   control causes a high loss rate for metered data and disrupts competing
   traffic flows in a shared network.
   The paper introduces the performance analysis of our proposed Split- and
   Aggregated-TCP (SA-TCP). SA-TCP complies with industrial bodies'
   directions (e.g., by Hydro One Networks Inc., Canada) in terms of the
   architecture, specifically the deployment of hardware devices called
   Regional Collectors (RC). We argue that RCs can function as transport
   layer aggregation devices rather than routing devices. This modification
   reduces packet loss rate and improves throughput for Smart Metering
   Infrastructure (SMI) traffic.
   Furthermore, we analyze the performance of the smart metering
   communication network running SA-TCP in terms of throughput, loss rate
   and latency. Our analysis is validated by extensive NS-2 simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Structured mini/micro-scale reactors continue to receive attention from
   both industry and academia due to their low pressure drop, high mass
   transfer rates and ease of scale-up when compared to conventional
   reactor technology. Commonly considered for heat and mass transfer
   limited reactions such as hydrogenations, hydrodesulphurization,
   oxidations and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, the performance of these
   systems is highly dependent on mixing and the interfacial area between
   phases. While existing literature describes the initial flow patterns
   generated by a broad range of two-phase contactors, few studies explore
   the dynamic impacts of downstream passive mixing elements.
   Experimental and computational methodologies for characterizing
   two-phase flow pattern transitions, pressure drop, mixing and mass
   transfer are discussed, with relevant examples for serpentine and
   venturi-based passive mixing designs. The efficacy of these two
   configurations are explored in the context of pressure drop, conditions
   leading to significant interface renewal, and design considerations for
   optimizing mass transfer. Challenges associate with the characterization
   of multi-phase flow through these systems are highlighted, and
   strategies suggested for both experimental and computational analysis of
   dynamic flow patterns and fluid-fluid interactions.}},

Abstract = {{There is currently a surge of interest in adaptive learning algorithms
   for applications ranging from ozone level peak predictions, learning
   stock market indicators, and detecting smart phone usage patterns. In
   such scenarios, the detection of change (or drift) in the concept being
   learned is important to ensure that correct, timely and relevant models
   are constructed. In addition, such data is often imbalanced and, to
   further complicate the issue, we are frequently interested in learning
   the minority class. It follows that ignoring these two aspects during
   learning may lead to unreliable, or even incorrect, models being built.
   In this research we discuss the interplay between concept drift
   detection and imbalanced data sets in order to ensure reliable results.
   We introduce a novel algorithm that, rather than considering a single
   performance evaluation measure such as accuracy for change detection,
   considers all the components of a confusion matrix and employs the
   cosine similarity coefficient. We evaluate our algorithm against a real
   world mobile phone database, as well as benchmarking datasets, and we
   compare it with two other state-of-the-art methods. The results show
   that our approach is particularly sensitive to concept drifts occurring
   in imbalanced data sets. Our evaluation indicates that our algorithm is
   able to detect concept drift reliably. Further, our method is shown to
   perform very well compared to the other techniques, especially when the
   drift occurs in the minority class of a class imbalance problem.}},

Abstract = {{Data centers play the crucial role in the delivery of Cloud services by
   enabling on-demand access to the shared resources such as software,
   platform, and infrastructure. Virtual Machine (VM) allocation is one of
   the challenging tasks in the data center management since user
   requirements, typically expressed as SLAs, have to be met with the
   minimum operational expenditure. Despite their huge processing and
   storage facilities, data centers are among the major contributors of the
   Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions of the IT services. In this paper, we
   propose a holistic approach for a large-scale Cloud system where the
   Cloud services are provisioned by several data centers interconnected
   over the backbone network. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Programming
   (MILP) formulation that aims at virtualizing the backbone topology and
   placing the VMs in data centers with the objective of minimum power
   consumption. We compare our proposed solution with a benchmark MILP
   model which selects the closest data centers that can accommodate the
   user requests taking into account the CPU, memory, and bandwidth
   capacities of the residing physical hosts. Collected experimental
   results show the benefit of the proposed management scheme in terms of
   power consumption, resource utilization, and fairness for medium size
   data centers.}},

Abstract = {{Bandwidth utilization and management advancements of Multi-Granular
   Optical Transport Networks (MG-OTN) have been shown to couple with power
   savings through lowered port counts. In this paper, we propose
   energy-efficient design of MG-OTNs by adopting multiple power levels at
   the MG nodes. Our proposed scheme combines the advantages of a
   previously proposed energy-efficient design method and introducing dual
   power state behavior to the MG nodes. According to the proposed scheme,
   a node can be either in the on state where it can add, drop and forward
   traffic at any granularity, or in the sleep state where it can only add
   and drop traffic, and accordingly, it saves the switching power
   consumption due to pass-through traffic. Through extensive simulations,
   we evaluate the proposed dual power state-based MG-OTN design in terms
   of energy-efficiency. Numerical results confirm that for all tested
   traffic patterns, putting a certain number of nodes in the sleep mode
   can guarantee significant power savings. Furthermore, we provide
   information on optimal selection of the nodes that have to be put in the
   sleep mode. Moreover, we study the topology dependence of the proposed
   scheme and show that high network connectivity leads to high power
   savings.}},

Abstract = {{Smart grid calls for low-cost, fine-grained and long-lasting monitoring
   solutions, to be able to provide reliable service to customers, enhance
   situational awareness capabilities and refine the operation of the grid
   and the microgrids, in addition to enabling prompt utility reaction to
   emergencies. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are promising candidates
   for monitoring the smart grid, given their capability to cover a large
   geographic region at low-cost. However, they do not provide long-lasting
   operation capability due to the limited battery lifetime of the sensors.
   Particularly, when sensors are deployed in hard-to-reach or hazardous
   environments, replacing the batteries of the sensors increase the cost
   of monitoring significantly. In the literature, energy-efficient
   protocols and ambient energy harvesting have been proposed to extend the
   lifetime of the sensors while neither of those offer a concrete solution
   for the smart grid. In this context, recent advances in Radio Frequency
   (RF) energy harvesting offers a unique solution to make WSNs
   operationally ready for smart grid monitoring tasks. Studies on RF
   energy harvesting have focused on uniform power delivery to all sensors,
   however it becomes essential to differentiate between critical zones and
   less critical zones in smart grid monitoring tasks. In this paper, we
   propose the Differentiated RF Power Transmission (DRIFT) scheme which is
   based on an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model that maximizes the
   power received by the high priority sensor nodes. We compare the
   performance of DRIFT with a path length minimizing approach, namely
   Sustainable wireless Rechargeable Sensor network (SuReSense). We show
   that DRIFT is able to provide more power to high priority nodes than
   SuReSense. We also show that there is a tradeoff between power
   maximization and path length minimization.}},

   improve power handling and to minimize the loss and maintain high

Abstract = {{Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology is promising technology
   in ubiquitous computing area. RFID is used for various applications,
   ranging from inventory systems to supply chain management solutions such
   as vehicle fleet management. In supply chain management system, RFID tag
   is used to identify the object, to which it is attached, without any
   physical contact in various locations. This makes tags susceptible to
   information leak. Thus security and privacy issues remain a major issue.
   Suitability of public key cryptography solutions in RFID system is open
   research problem. In recent years, practicability of asymmetric
   cryptography on RFID applications has been discussed. Though EC-GPS
   scheme allows compact implementation on a tag, it has several flaws. In
   this paper, we propose robust RFID authentication scheme for supply
   chain process using improved EC-GPS. We have provided security proof,
   security analysis and performance evaluation of the proposed scheme to

Abstract = {{Accessing video content on mobile devices has become widespread in
   recent years. The wireless network has to become content aware in order
   to offer enhanced quality of video service through efficient utilisation
   of the wireless spectrum. This paper proposes a scheme for end-to-end
   video transmission over Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. The network
   elements are made aware of the critical video frames that are
   transmitted through the network with the help of a field in Internet
   Protocol (IP) header which reduces the processing time. A new mode of
   operation called Hybrid Mode (HM) for Radio Link Control (RLC) of
   evolved NodeB (eNodeB) has been defined to ensure the reliable delivery
   of critical video frames which in turn increase the video quality. The
   simulation results with the proposed scheme show a 7\% increase in
   received video quality in comparison to the legacy Unacknowledged Mode
   (UM) of RLC. The proposed scheme also removes the major jitter and
   provides a reduction in end-to-end delay by 99\% when compared with the
   Acknowledged Mode (AM).}},

Abstract = {{4G standards such as Long Term Evolution (LTE) use non-constant envelope
   modulation techniques with high peak-to-average ratios. Power amplifiers
   (PA) implemented in such applications are forced to operate at a
   backed-off region from saturation. Thus, to reduce power consumption, a
   design of a high efficiency PA that can maintain the efficiency for a
   wider range of RF signals is required. In this paper, a two-way 10W
   Doherty amplifier designed in a compact 10x11.5mm(2) monolithic
   microwave integrated circuit using GaN technology is presented. Suitable
   for a 4G LTE 5W pico-cell base station, which entails the frequencies
   from 2.62-2.69GHz, the design achieves high efficiencies of over 50\% at
   both back-off and peak power regions without compromising on the
   stringent linearity requirements of 4G LTE standards. This demonstrates
   a 17\% increase in power added efficiency at 6 dB back-off from peak
   power compared to conventional Class AB amplifier performance.}},

Abstract = {{The smart home contains a network that connects home elements like
   sensors, HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air conditioning), appliances
   and thermostat. In our previous work, we proposed an approach that used
   web services to remotely interact with smart home elements in a smart
   grid environment. These interactions include adjusting the temperature
   or reading energy consumption. We assumed a smart home with a wireless
   sensor network based on Zigbee. There was a central computer that could
   access all home elements. Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) was
   used to implement the web service on central computer. In this paper, we
   enhance the system by including new features. The algorithm to sell

Abstract = {{In this work, a novel configuration of auxiliary one-dimensional (1-D)
   FDTD grids is proposed to provide the obliquely incident plane wave at
   the total-field scattered-field (TFSF) boundary in stratified dispersive
   media. Thus a closed TFSF boundary is formed, where the incident waves
   are directly obtained from the auxiliary simulations without any
   interpolation. Given the dispersion characteristic, perfectly matched
   layer (PML) is implemented to the 1-D simulations. Examples demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed technique in analysing the case of an
   obliquely incident wave on layered dispersive media. Furthermore, the
   numerical result for an arbitrary incident angle can be provided with
   this method, greatly extending some previous work that only analyzed the
   case of normal incidence.}},

Abstract = {{Load balancing is a vital mechanism for improving the performance of
   distributed simulations or even for enabling their execution. A
   balancing technique has been designed in order to provide a balancing
   scheme for HLA-based simulations on non-dedicated resources. However,
   this technique lacks efficiency by producing large amounts of
   unnecessary federate migrations, so a self-adaptive mechanism has been
   introduced in the technique in order to correct its balancing
   responsiveness. As a drawback, the self-adaptation technique assumes
   that only the frequency of federate migrations represents the balancing
   efficiency. This leads the scheme to present static parameters
   regardless of the conditions of the environment, which in turn can
   restrict the balancing response to imbalances. Thus, awareness to
   migration delays is inserted into the self-adaptive balancing scheme in
   order that more precise and more realistic analysis of balancing
   efficiency can be enabled. Experiments have been conducted to show the
   performance gain of the proposed scheme when compared to the distributed
   and self-adaptive load balancing systems.}},

   synthesized using a modified alcohol method which involves the
   stabilizing agent, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Two different average
   sizes (13.1 and 17.1 nm) of Au nanoparticles were synthesized. These
   catalysts were tested for gas phase CO oxidation. Since PVP is known to
   block the active Au sites, the catalysts were calcined at 300 degrees C
   and 600 degrees C in order to remove the PVP. Overall, higher catalytic
   activity was found for the smaller Au nanoparticles. It was also found
   that calcination is required in order to achieve activity, even though
   the particle size increases with this treatment. The effect of
   calcination temperature did not prove to be significant. It is
   demonstrated that O2- ionically conductive YSZ is a promising catalyst

Abstract = {{This paper presents a modified version of HybridSLAM (HS) method using
   unscented Kalman filter to solve simultaneous localization and mapping
   problem. Instead of applying extended Kalman filter for SLAM (EKF-SLAM)
   to build the map of the environment, an unscented Kalman filter (UKF)
   was added to the HS algorithm. This would allow including higher order
   of non-linearity of the motion. The new method called Unscented
   HybridSLAM (UHS) is constructing the global map more accurately compare
   to the original HS and by employing the same constraint of local sub-map
   fusion technique, a more reliable solution to SLAM problem is achieved.
   The unscented Kalman filter takes advantage of both statistical and
   analytical linearization techniques to estimate the global map. The
   local map in the vicinity of the robot is estimated using FastSLAM and
   the local map is fused to the map using constrained local sub-map fusion
   technique. Unscented HybridSLAM uses a minimal set of chosen samples to
   approximate the posterior mean and covariance for a non-linear system.
   The unscented HybridSLAM performance is compared to the original
   HybridSLAM and FastSLAM algorithms and it is shown that in case of
   severe nonlinearity, the proposed unscented HybridSLAM is outperforming
   current filters in terms of estimation of the path and map building.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile devices (smart phones, tablets, laptops, embedded boards, robots)
   can serve as `dumb' terminals for cloud computing services over
   intelligent network. Mobile cloud has emerged as a new cloud computing
   platform that `puts cloud into a pocket'. Important issues include
   optimizing the scheduling and transport schemes, access management, and
   application optimization, for mobile devices to achieve energy saving.
   This talk will first introduce the development of mobile cloud computing
   and describe some applications involving multimedia, vision/recognition,
   graphics, gaming, text processing. Next, it will present the
   transmission, computation, and sensing challenges of green computing in
   mobile cloud. It will also discuss the possible solutions from various
   perspectives. Energy savings for task outsourcing and location based
   services will be discussed in detail. `Crowd computing' combines mobile
   devices and social interactions to achieve large-scale distributed
   computation. Examples include task farming, participatory and
   opportunistic crowd-sourced sensing. One particular emerging concept is
   the `vehicular cloud'. For example, traffic lights in a congested area
   could be rescheduled by running the rescheduling code (controlled by
   municipality) on the collective computational platform provided by the
   cars.}},

Abstract = {{With the emergence of mobile cloud computing (MCC), an increasingly
   number of applications and services becomes available on mobile devices.
   In the meantime, the constrained battery power of mobile devices makes a
   serious impact on user experience. As one increasingly prevalent type of
   applications in mobile cloud environments, location based applications
   (LBAs) present some inherent limitations surrounding energy. For
   example, the GPS (Global Positioning System) based positioning mechanism
   is well-known to be extremely power-hungry. Due to the severity of the
   issue, considerable researches have been devoted to energy-efficient
   locating sensing mechanism in the last few years. These efforts toward
   enhancing energy efficiency have allowed us to provide a comprehensive
   survey of recent work on low-power design of LBAs. (C) 2011 Published by

Abstract = {{A new oscillometric pulse index (OPI) derived from the maximum slope
   (MS) of each pulse in the oscillometric blood pressure waveform is
   proposed for blood pressure estimation. Maximum slope for each pulse is
   obtained using the first derivative of the pulse and an envelope of the
   values corresponding to the maximum slopes is obtained. The maximum of
   the envelope is taken as the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and the
   systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)
   estimates are obtained as a fraction of the MAP, similar to the
   traditional maximum amplitude algorithm (MAA). The proposed algorithm is
   tested on 18 healthy subjects. The MAP, SBP and DBP estimates obtained
   from the proposed algorithm are compared with those obtained from a
   commercial blood pressure device and with the estimates obtained using

Abstract = {{In future Internet architectures, Virtual Network Providers (VNP) must
   be able to compose virtual networks in a way that balances security with
   other priorities as expressed by Service Providers (SP). In this paper,
   we outline a framework in which a VNP can assess the security and
   assurance (robustness) properties of virtual networks and use these to
   help select an SP-appropriate topology. The topology selection algorithm
   is based on the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the Technique for
   Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and uses cost
   and robustness as selection constraints. Our framework allows the VNP to
   identify the customer's needs for security and balance these with other
   priorities such as quality of service and cost. We show that this
   approach fits naturally into the business model of the VNP and takes
   advantage of risk management activities that may already be performed by
   SPs. Because security concerns can dampen enthusiasm for new ways of
   doing business, addressing the challenges above can help ease the
   transition to the future Internet.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile TV and Video on Demand (VoD) streaming services represents an
   important service which will be provided by Fourth Generation (4G)
   cellular networks. Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term
   Evolution (LTE) is one of the most successful 4G technologies used by
   most of the 4G operators for delivering mobile broadband. In the past,
   cellular systems have mostly focused on unicast transmission systems.
   But, with the adoption of new services which are intended to be
   delivered to a broad range of users, multicast and broadcast systems are
   becoming widely popular. Enhanced Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service
   (EMBMS) is defined in 3GPP specification to support download delivery
   and streaming delivery to group users in LTE mobile networks. In 3GPP
   Release 8 specification, the EMBMS transmission is classified into
   single-cell transmission and MBSFN (Multicast Broadcast Single Frequency
   Network) transmission. H. 264 was the recommended video codec for
   Universal Mobile Telecommunication System (UMTS) MBMS service. However,
   the Scalable Video Coding (SVC) extension of H. 264 allows efficient
   temporal, spatial and quality scalabilities. In this paper, we propose a
   video streaming method with SVC for MBSFN networks with adaptive
   modulation and coding (AMC) and frequency scheduling based on
   distribution of users in different channel quality regions. Through
   simulations we demonstrate that spectrum savings in the order of 72 to
   82\% is achievable in different user distribution scenarios with our
   proposed scheme. These savings in spectrum can be used for serving other
   MBSFN, single cell MBMS or unicast bearers, and it can also be used for
   increasing the video quality of the same MBSFN bearer.}},

Abstract = {{Resource discovery aims to assist the Virtual Network Provider (VNP) in
   selecting the best Infrastructure Provider (InP) which has the best

   proposing an aggregation based approach, called Aggregation-based
   Discovery for Virtual Network Environments (ADVNE). ADVNE allows VNP to
   make use of information on dynamic (nonfunctional) attributes to enhance
   the efficiency of resource discovery process while minimizing the

Abstract = {{Mobile robots nowadays can assist wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in
   many jeopardizing scenarios that unexpectedly arise during their
   operational lifetime. We focus on an emerging kind of cooperative
   networking system in which a small team of robotic agents lies at a base
   station. Their mission is to service an already-deployed WSN by
   periodically replacing all damaged sensors in the field with passive,
   spare ones so as to preserve the existing network coverage. This novel
   application scenario is here baptized as ``multiple-carrier coverage
   repair{''} ((MCR)-R-2) and modeled as a new generalization of the
   vehicle routing problem. A hybrid metaheuristic algorithm is put forward
   to derive nearly-optimal sensor replacement trajectories for the robotic
   fleet in a short running time. The composite scheme relies on a swarm of
   artificial fireflies in which each individual follows the exploratory
   principles featured by Harmony Search. Infeasible candidate solutions
   are gradually driven into feasibility under the influence of a weak
   Pareto dominance relationship. A repair heuristic is finally applied to
   yield a full-blown solution. To the best of our knowledge, our scheme is
   the first one in literature that tackles MC2R instances. Empirical
   results indicate that promising solutions can be achieved in a limited
   time span.}},

Abstract = {{Many access control models have been proposed in the literature, and
   they have been extensively studied under the acronyms of DAC, MAC, RBAC,
   ABAC, etc. Each of these models has been studied in isolation, but some
   real-life situations need elements of several of them, in order to
   properly express data protection needs of complex organizations. A
   formal framework is presented, that allows not only to combine elements
   of these models, but also to generalize them in new ways. This framework
   includes elements of a lifecycle methodology, which starts with a
   UML-based formalism, called UACML, that expresses semantic elements
   (classes and their relationships) needed for general access control
   systems. It continues with the representation of UACML diagrams in our
   language CatBAC. The latter is a compact textual representation of UACML
   that makes it possible to express realistic policy systems involving
   many entities and many constraints. CatBAC is based on Prolog, and this
   makes it possible to implement analysis and verification tools.}},

Abstract = {{The aggregate interference distribution in cognitive radio networks is
   studied in a rigorous analytical way using the popular Poisson point
   process model. While a number of results are available for this model of
   regular (non-cognitive) networks, cognitive ones present an extra level
   of difficulty for the analysis, mainly due to the exclusion region
   around the primary receiver, which are typically addressed via various
   ad-hoc approximations (e. g. based on the interference cumulants) or via
   the large-deviation analysis. Unlike the previous studies, here we do
   not use ad-hoc approximations but rather obtain the asymptotic
   interference distribution in a systematic and rigorous way. This is in
   contrast to the large deviation analysis, which provides only the
   (exponential) order of scaling but not the outage probability itself.
   Unlike the cumulant-based analysis, our approach provides a guaranteed
   level of accuracy at the distribution tail. Additionally, our analysis
   also provides a number of novel insights. In particular, we demonstrate
   that there is a critical transition point below which the outage
   probability decays only polynomially but above which it decays
   exponentially. This provides a solid analytical foundation to the
   earlier empirical observations in the literature and also reveals how
   typical outage events occur in different regimes. In addition, the
   proposed asymptotic expressions are also shown to be accurate in the
   non-asymptotic regimes.}},

Abstract = {{A Smart Grid is the modernization of the electricity grid using
   communication technology with the prime goals of reducing energy
   consumption as well as cost increasing reliability and creating new
   services for all participants. It comprises key components such as
   Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) that includes Neighborhood area
   network (NAN). When multi-hopping is considered in wireless
   communication, especially in WiFi and ZigBee, the range of communication
   can be extended to communicate with the gateway collector in AMI
   network. Wireless mesh AMI network may have smart meters, NAN gateway,
   and fixed as well as mobile repeaters. Though many techniques have been
   developed to secure on-demand routing protocols in wireless multi-hop ad
   hoc networks, these protocols have shortcomings. In this paper, we
   propose an efficient and robust security mechanism for multipath routing
   protocol in wireless mesh AMI networks. We have analyzed its robustness
   to various attacks. The simulation results show that the proposed

Abstract = {{The volatile world economy has greatly affected fuel prices, while
   pollution and gas emissions are increasing to negatively impact global
   warming. Vehicular networks offer a promising approach that can be
   applied in transportation systems to reduce fuel consumption and
   emissions. One of the interesting applications involves a traffic light
   signal sending information to approaching vehicles. Based on that
   information, the vehicle receiving the message adapts its speed to a
   speed called the recommended speed (S-R), which is the speed that helps
   the vehicle to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. In this paper, we
   propose an optimization model with the objective of minimizing fuel
   consumption and emissions. The speed that can achieve this goal is the
   optimum S-R. We also propose an efficient heuristic expression to
   compute near-optimal values of the optimum S-R.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor network (WSNs) are considered as suitable solution for
   long-time and large-scale outdoor environmental monitoring. However, an
   important feature that distinguishes the WSNs from traditional
   monitoring systems is their energy constraints. In fact, these nodes
   have often limited and usually not replenish able power source.
   Therefore managing these limited and precious resources is a key
   challenge. In this paper we use an optimization scheme based on adaptive
   modulation and power control for a green routing protocol. The
   optimization mechanism is subject of certain QoS requirement in term of
   total end-to end delay time and bit error rate. The simulation results
   show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the consumed energy of the

Abstract = {{Smart grid aims to empower the current power grid with the integration
   of two-way communication and computer technology. The smart home
   contains a network that connects home elements like sensors, appliances

   web services to remotely interact with smart home elements in a smart
   grid environment. These interactions include adjusting the temperature
   or reading energy consumption. We assumed a smart home with a wireless
   sensor network based on Zigbee. In this paper, we extend the system by
   including quality of service, security and XMPP (eXtensible Messaging
   and Presence Protocol). Different levels of access control are provided.
   Advantage of XMPP is that it provides near real-time communication and
   security. Secured web services also facilitate selling of energy back to
   the grid. The performance, advantage and limitations of the
   communications between user and elements via secured web services are
   demonstrated here.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel paradigm to jointly fine-tune

   accompanied vertical-handover (VHO) operations in future

   statically configured, VHO schemes that lack the ability to quickly
   adapt to changing network loads, the proposed framework continuously
   derives optimal VHO configuration policies with respect to handover
   initiation and network selection. In addition, the proposed work
   reconfigures the newly created SLA instances offered to the new users
   according to network conditions with the objective of maximizing the
   service provider monetary profit. To achieve these goals, we derive a
   new model for VHO-based SLA that incorporates service guarantees during
   the transient phase of the VHO operation. Next, we present a generic
   model for the control and adaptation of any VHO scheme through the
   adoption of various types of policies. These models are incorporated in
   a novel architecture that relies on a policy-based real-time simulator
   as its core component for system adaptability. Performance evaluation
   results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a new vertical handover (VHO)-enhanced mobile
   service discovery and composition method over a hybrid service overlay
   network (H-SON). The overlay considers the dynamic characteristics of
   mobile nodes in the decision for node placement as well as the types of
   services provided and Quality of Service (QoS) levels. The mobile nature
   of media clients provokes a necessity to consider VHO operations to meet
   the requirements of offered service level agreements (SLAs). The
   integrated framework continuously derives optimal VHO configuration
   policies with respect to handover initiation and network selection for
   service specific overlay network (SSON) node migration. The VHO-enhanced
   service composition method allows for efficient, accurate, and QoS-aware
   component service discovery, composition, and execution. We demonstrate
   that our approach provides better performance and reduced composition
   delay in heterogeneous network environments when compared to other

Abstract = {{Metallic nanowires of rectangular cross-section can operate as isolated
   or arrayed optical monopole or dipole antennas, and when deposited on a
   Si substrate and covered with water, become useful as (bio) chemical
   sensors. The optical performance of such antennas is assessed over a
   broad wavelength range as a function of geometrical parameters,
   including wire thickness, width, length, and gap (in the case of
   dipoles). Effects caused by varying the pitch of two-dimensional arrays
   of antennas are also determined. Given a uniform broadside excitation,
   antennas resonate in the main mode of propagation of the corresponding
   asymmetric metal stripe waveguide, and antennas performance is related
   to its propagation characteristics. The structures considered are
   amenable to fabrication via metal evaporation and lift-off, with the
   nanowires defined by electron beam patterning.}},

Abstract = {{Pose and motion estimation techniques required to drive robotic
   manipulators involved in quality control in the automotive industry
   often encounter important limitations when applied on weakly textured
   panels moving in complex environments. Difficulties originate from the
   reduced performance of classical feature extraction, tracking and
   matching algorithms that heavily depend on the presence of rich textures
   over the objects. While maintaining a simple hardware architecture
   relying on passive stereoscopy, this paper proposes a supervisory
   approach for machine vision systems that overcomes the sensitivity of
   feature-based tracking to occlusions, photometric variations and
   ubiquitous appearances of factory associates in the field of view of the
   vision system. Furthermore, the drift accumulating with the tracking
   module is also corrected. Experimentation demonstrates the suitability
   of the proposed supervised pose and motion estimator for automated
   robotic marking of surface deformations over moving panels.}},

   However, most of these inspection stations need to be tuned manually and

   tuning of real-time vision-based inspection systems for bakery products.
   The combination of feature selection techniques with machine learning is
   assessed in terms of classification performance. A formal automated
   tuning methodology is introduced and evaluated experimentally with data
   from industrial inspection stations. The work demonstrates that an
   inspection system automatically tuned with the proposed technique can
   systematically achieve 98\% correct classification when compared with
   the classification generated with a manually tuned system.}},

Abstract = {{For protecting the authenticity of multimedia objects, watermarking
   plays a vital role, since, they are much easier to get copied, exchanged
   and modified these days. Conventional watermarking techniques as
   available are not always competent enough to protect the authenticity of
   multimedia objects as they are usually applied in the uncompressed
   domain. To address this deficiency, the subject paper presents a new
   compressed domain video watermarking scheme. The method proposed herein
   embeds several binary images decomposed from a single watermarked image
   into different scenes in a video sequence. The spatial spread spectrum
   watermark is embedded directly into the compressed bit streams by
   modifying the discrete cosine transform coefficients. In order to embed
   the watermark with minimum loss in image fidelity, a visual mask based
   on local image characteristics is incorporated. Simulation experiments
   demonstrate that the developed technique yields effective and robust
   protection against conventional spatial strikes, viz. scaling and frame
   averaging besides temporal attacks.}},

Abstract = {{The automated servicing of vehicles is becoming more and more a reality

   only a rough model of the surface of a vehicle, other operations, such
   as changing of a wheel or filling the gas tank, require correct
   localization of the different parts of the vehicle on which operations
   are to be performed. The paper describes an image-based approach to
   roughly localize vehicle parts over the surface of a vehicle with a
   bounding box approach based on a model of human visual attention. The
   proposed method is automatically adapted for different views of a
   vehicle and obtains average localization rates for different vehicle
   parts of over 95\% for a dataset of 120 vehicles belonging to three

Abstract = {{The distributed energy resources (DER) contains several technologies,
   such as diesel engines, small wind turbines, photovoltaic inverters,
   etc. The control of DER components with storage devices and
   (controllable) loads, such as batteries, capacitors, dump loads, are
   central to the concept of the Micro Grids (MGs). A MG can operate
   interconnected to the main distribution grid or in islanded mode. This
   paper presents experimental tests for static and dynamic stability
   analysis carried out in a dedicated laboratory for research in
   distributed control and micro-grid with a high share of renewable energy
   production. Moreover to point out, on a laboratory scale, the coupling
   between DR and storage and to effectively compensate wind fluctuations a
   number of tests have been done. In order to find out the parameters of
   various types of DER components for dynamic simulation models a number
   of tests are required under different operation modes and loads. The
   testing reporting here includes three modes of operation: stand alone,
   parallel/hybrid and grid connection.}},

Abstract = {{The conventional design of home security systems typically monitors only
   the property and lacks physical control aspects of the house itself.
   Also, the term security is not well defined because there is a time
   delay between the alarm system going on and actual arrival of the
   security personnel. This paper discusses the development of a home
   security and monitoring system that works where the traditional security
   systems that are mainly concerned about curbing burglary and gathering
   evidence against trespassing fail. The paper presents the design and
   implementation details of this new home control and security system
   based on field programmable gate array (FPGA) The user here can interact
   directly with the system through a web-based interface over the
   Internet, while home appliances like air conditioners, lights, door
   locks and gates are remotely controlled through a user-friendly web
   page. An additional feature that enhances the security aspect of the
   system is its capability of monitoring entry points such as doors and
   windows so that in the event any breach, an alerting email message is
   sent to the home owner instantly.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses signal processing aspects concerning the iterative
   experiment-based improvement of the performance of crane mode control
   systems of inverted pendulum systems. The control system performance
   specifications are imposed in terms of a reference model, and the
   objective is to force the output error defined as the difference between
   the cart position as controlled output and the model reference output to
   tend to zero. An optimization problem with an objective function defined
   as the sum of squared output errors is defined. Iterative Feedback
   Tuning (IFT) algorithms are employed to solve the optimization problem
   where the variables are the controller tuning parameters. Four-parameter
   discrete-time linear controllers are proposed and tuned by IFT
   algorithms. The real-time experimental results highlight the performance
   improvement ensured by the position control system with the new
   IFT-based linear controller with respect to the initial
   proportional-integral one.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesizing aliasing-free space compactor for built-in self-testing of
   very large scale integration circuits and systems is of great
   importance, especially because of the design paradigm shift in recent
   years from system-on-board to system-on-chip. This paper investigates
   and provides additional results on a recently developed approach to
   designing aliasing-free space compaction hardware targeting particularly
   embedded cores-based system-on-chips for single stuck-line faults,
   extending well-known concept from conventional switching theory, viz.
   that of compatibility relation as used in the minimization of incomplete
   sequential machines. For a pair of response outputs of the circuit under
   test, the method introduces the notion of fault detection compatibility
   and conditional fault detection compatibility (conditional upon some
   other response output pair being simultaneously fault detection
   compatible) with respect to two-input XOR/XNOR logic. The process is
   illustrated with design details of space compactors for the
   International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS 85) combinational
   (and ISCAS 89 full-scan sequential) benchmark circuits using simulation
   programs ATALANTA and FSIM, attesting to the importance of the technique
   from the viewpoint of simplicity, resultant low area overhead and full
   fault coverage for single stuck-line faults, thereby making it an
   appropriate choice in commercial design environments.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing availability of smartphones, tablets and other
   computing devices, technology consumers have grown accustomed to
   performing all of their computing tasks anytime, anywhere and on any
   device. There is a greater need to support ubiquitous connectivity and
   accommodate users by providing software as network-accessible services.
   In this paper, we propose a MAS-based approach to adaptive service
   composition and provision that automates the selection and execution of
   a suitable composition plan for a given service. With agents capable of
   autonomous and intelligent behavior, the composition plan is selected in
   a dynamic negotiation driven by a utility-based decision-making
   mechanism; and the composite service is built by a coalition of agents
   each providing a component necessary to the target service. The same
   service can be built in variations for catering to dynamic user contexts
   and further personalizing the user experience. Also multiple services
   can be grouped to satisfy new user needs.}},

Abstract = {{Policy administrators increasingly face the challenge of managing large
   policy bases, and this need becomes more acute with the growing
   importance of fine-grained access control models, e. g. ABAC. We have
   shown in previous work that simple policies mostly based on conjunctions
   of single attribute conditions, can be merged into more complex
   conditions composed of combinations of conjunctions and disjunctions of
   attribute/value pairs. Here, we propose an algorithm that uses a
   recursive process of subsumption applied on the original set of policies
   that results in a complex and short policy, often significantly
   compressing the original policy. We present this algorithm, and discuss
   the advantages of this approach, i.e. its performance when working on
   the policy structures encountered in real-life policy sets, its
   scalability, and its ability to deal with large alphabet sets.}},

Abstract = {{Thin stillage (CTS) from a dry-grind corn ethanol plant was evaluated as
   a carbon source for anaerobic digestion (AD) by batch and high rate
   semi-continuous down-flow stationary fixed film (DSFF) reactors.
   Biochemical methane potential (BMP) assays were carried out with CTS
   concentrations ranging from approximately 2,460-27,172 mg total chemical
   oxygen demand (TCOD) per litre, achieved by diluting CTS with clean
   water or a combination of clean water and treated effluent. High TCOD,
   SCOD and volatile solids (VS) removal efficiencies of 85 +/- 2, 94 +/- 0
   and 82 +/- 1\% were achieved for CTS diluted with only clean water at an
   organic concentration of 21,177 mg TCOD per litre, with a methane yield
   of 0.30 L methane per gram TCODremoved at standard temperature and
   pressure (STP, 0 W C and 1 atmosphere). Batch studies investigating the
   use of treated effluent for dilution showed promising results.
   Continuous studies employed two mesophilic DSFF anaerobic digesters
   treating thin stillage, operated at hydraulic retention times (HRT) of
   20, 14.3, 8.7, 6.3, 5 and 4.2 d. Successful digestion was achieved up to
   an organic loading rate (OLR) of approximately 7.4 g TCOD L(-1)d(-1) at
   a 5 d HRT with a yield of 2.05 LCH4 L(-1)d(-1) (at STP) and TCOD and VS

Title = {{A novel reduced power compressive sensing technique for wideband
   cognitive radio}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Wideband spectrum sensing for cognitive radio requires high rate analog
   to digital (A/D) converters whose power consumption is proportional to
   the sampling rate. In this article, we propose to use sub-Nyquist
   non-uniform sampling for spectrum sensing to reduce the power
   consumption. Since the received signal samples are correlated in the
   time domain, we estimate the missing samples by using the
   expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. It is shown that the combined
   sub-Nyquist non-uniform sampling and EM algorithm consume much less

Abstract = {{This paper gives a simple iterative formulation of Correlation-based
   Tuning (CbT). A reference model sets the performance specifications of
   the control system, and the control objective is to minimize the output
   error, i.e., the difference between the controlled output and the
   reference model output. With this regard an optimization problem is
   defined, and the objective function is expressed as the squared sum of
   the cross-correlation function between the output error and the
   reference input. The minimization of this objective function specific to
   CbT is carried out by a Robbins-Monro procedure that ensures the
   iterative tuning of controller parameters. A novel iterative CbT
   algorithm is proposed on the basis of the iterative estimation of the
   gradient of the objective function in terms of two experiments per
   iteration conducted on the real-world control system. The algorithm is
   tested in the tuning of a PI controller dedicated to the speed control
   of a nonlinear servo system. Real-time experimental results are given.}},

Pages = {{407-434}},
Abstract = {{Computer animation requirements differ from those of traditional
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) investigations in that visual
   plausibility and rapid frame update rates trump physical accuracy. We
   present an overview of the main techniques for fluid simulation in
   computer animation, starting with Eulerian grid approaches, the Lattice
   Boltzmann method, Fourier transform techniques and Lagrangian particle
   introduction. Adaptive grid methods, precomputation of results for model
   reduction, parallelisation and computation on graphical processing units
   (GPUs) are reviewed in the context of accelerating simulation
   computations for animation. A survey of current specific approaches for
   the application of these techniques to the simulation of smoke, fire,
   water, bubbles, mixing, phase change and solid-fluid coupling is also
   included. Adding plausibility to results through particle introduction,
   turbulence detail and concentration on regions of interest by level set
   techniques has elevated the degree of accuracy and realism of recent
   animations. Basic approaches are described here. Techniques to control
   the simulation to produce a desired visual effect are also discussed.
   Finally, some references to rendering techniques and haptic applications
   are mentioned to provide the reader with a complete picture of the
   challenges of simulating fluids in computer animation.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON CONTROL AND OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2683-2725}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with optimization of uncertain stochastic
   systems, in which uncertainty is described by a total variation distance
   constraint between the measures induced by the uncertain systems and the
   measure induced by the nominal system, while the payoff is a linear
   functional of the uncertain measure. Robustness at the abstract setting
   is formulated as a minimax game, in which the control seeks to minimize
   the payoff over the admissible controls while the uncertainty aims at
   maximizing it over the total variation distance constraint. It is shown
   that the maximizing measure in the total variation distance constraint
   exists, while the resulting payoff is a linear combination of L-1 and
   L-infinity norms. Further, the maximizing measure is characterized by a
   linear combination of a tilted measure and the nominal measure, giving
   rise to a payoff which is a nonlinear functional on the space of
   measures to be minimized over the admissible controls. The abstract
   formulation and results are subsequently applied to continuous-time
   uncertain stochastic controlled systems, in which the control seeks to
   minimize the payoff while the uncertainty aims to maximize it over the
   total variation distance constraint. The minimization over the
   admissible controls of the nonlinear functional payoff is addressed by
   developing a generalized principle of optimality or dynamic programming
   equation satisfied by the value function. Subsequently, it is proved
   that the value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB)
   equation. It is also shown that the value function is also a viscosity
   solution of the HJB equation. Finally, the linear quadratic case is
   studied, and it is shown that the infinity norm of a quadratic payoff is
   well defined and finite. Throughout the paper the formulation and
   conclusions are related to previous work found in the literature.}},

Title = {{Improving multi-view semi-supervised learning with agreement-based
   sampling}},
Journal = {{INTELLIGENT DATA ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{745-761}},
Abstract = {{Semi-supervised learning algorithms are widely used to build strong
   learning models when there are not enough labeled instances. Some
   semi-supervised learning algorithms, including co-training and co-EM,
   use multiple views to build learning models. Past research has shown
   that multi-view learning usually shows advantages over learning with a
   single view. However, conditions such as independence of the views,
   which is often hard to achieve, makes successful application of such
   methods in real world problems difficult. We would like to know if the
   performance of a multi-view semi-supervised learning method can be
   improved even though the available views are not necessarily
   independent. In this paper, we propose a simple sampling method,
   agreement-based sampling, as one way of improving the classification
   performance of multi-view semi-supervised learning algorithms. We apply
   agreement-based sampling to three major multi-view semi-supervised
   learning algorithms: co-training, co-EM and multi-view semi-supervised
   ensemble. The experiments with real-world datasets show that our
   sampling method can indeed significantly improve the performance of
   these three algorithms. We also investigated the relation between the
   quality of the expanded labeled set generated by the semi-supervised
   learning algorithm and the classification error rate of the learned
   model.}},

Pages = {{829-879}},
Abstract = {{Consider a set of n > 2 identical mobile computational entities in the
   plane, called robots, operating in Look-Compute-Move cycles, without any
   means of direct communication. The GATHERING PROBLEM is the primitive
   task of all entities gathering in finite time at a point not fixed in
   advance, without any external control. The problem has been extensively
   studied in the literature under a variety of strong assumptions (e.g.,
   synchronicity of the cycles, instantaneous movements, complete memory of
   the past, common coordinate system, etc.). In this paper we consider the
   setting without those assumptions, that is, when the entities are
   oblivious (i.e., they do not remember results and observations from
   previous cycles), disoriented (i.e., have no common coordinate system),
   and fully asynchronous (i.e., no assumptions exist on timing of cycles
   and activities within a cycle). The existing algorithmic contributions
   for such robots are limited to solutions for n <= 4 or for restricted
   sets of initial configurations of the robots; the question of whether
   such weak robots could deterministically gather has remained open. In
   this paper, we prove that indeed the GATHERING PROBLEM is solvable, for
   any n > 2 and any initial configuration, even under such restrictive
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{To improve safety, a warning message in VANETs should be delivered both
   reliably and urgently. Existing solutions either tend to compromise
   propagation delay or do not reach high reliability due to broadcast
   storm problem caused by excessive retransmissions. We propose ReC, which
   exploits geographical information to help nodes autonomously achieve
   agreement on forwarding strategies. Each forwarding candidate ranks
   itself and its neighbors (who affirmatively or potentially received the
   message already) by distance to the centroid of neighbors in need of
   message, to assign different priority in forwarding among neighboring
   nodes and remarkably suppress unnecessary retransmission, while enabling
   best nodes to transmit the packet without waiting. The effectiveness and
   efficiency of this method is validated through extensive simulations
   under 802.11p settings. The results demonstrate that the proposed
   protocol achieves the high reliability of leading state-of-the-art
   solutions, while at the same time significantly enhances timeliness,
   dedicating itself to disseminating emergency messages in 2D vehicular

   (IDMA) detector is considered when channel estimation errors are
   present. This detector can be quite effective under severe channel
   estimation errors when channel estimator statistics are considered. The
   detector is generalized for QPSK signaling. It is shown that the overall
   effect of the CSI mismatch can be seen as an additive noise term,
   without approximation. Moreover, the term is constant for all users,
   paths and for in-phase and quadrature components. The performances of
   the detector are studied by Monte-Carlo simulations. From the results,
   it is shown that the improvement depends on the severity of the
   mismatch, the number of paths and the number of users. A 10\% capacity
   increase can be obtained with respect to the number of users.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) provide wide reach and coverage at
   low-cost which enable them to be utilized in various fields such as
   health, smart grid, industrial facilities and defense. One of the
   fundamental limitations of WSNs in long-lasting applications is the
   network lifetime. To overcome the battery constraint of sensor nodes,
   duty cycling, energy-efficient protocols and energy harvesting have been
   considered widely in the literature. A recently emerging energy
   harvesting technique, namely Radio Frequency (RF)-based wireless energy
   transfer promises to extend the lifetime of Wireless Rechargeable Sensor
   Networks (WRSN) with no dependency on intermittent ambient energy
   resources. In RF-based wireless energy transfer, deploying power
   transmitters to fixed locations is costly due to range limitations of
   wireless power. For this reason, mobile power transmitters that visit a
   few selected locations; i.e. landmarks are employed. Furthermore, in
   WSNs sensors are expected to perform certain tasks or missions during
   their lifetime. The achievement of each mission provides certain
   profits. In this paper, we aim to optimally select the landmarks for
   sensor nodes that participate in profit maximizing missions. We propose
   an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model, namely Mission-Aware
   Placement of Wireless Power Transmitters (MAPIT) that optimizes the
   placement of RF-based chargers in the WRSN by maximizing the number of
   nodes receiving power from a landmark and those that contribute the
   maximum profit by achieving a mission. We show that the profit increases
   for low landmark limit since the number of nodes receiving power from a
   landmark increases under less landmarks. On the other hand, profit
   reduces by increased number of missions since the nodes participating to
   missions become spatially diverse.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud computing calls for efficient solutions to manage the energy
   consumption of the transport, process and storage services. Recently, we
   have shown that energy savings in the cloud network and the data centers
   are at the expense of increased delay; hence degraded service quality.
   In this paper we propose a new scheme, Delay and Power Minimized
   Provisioning (DePoMiP) to address energy versus delay trade-off in the
   cloud network. DePoMiP reconfigures the cloud network and provisions the
   demands by jointly minimizing the energy consumption and propagation
   delay. Through simulations, we compare DePoMiP to our previously
   proposed heuristics for delay-minimized provisioning and power-minimized
   provisioning of the demands. Simulation results show that DePoMiP mimics
   power-minimized provisioning in terms of power consumption while it
   provisions the demands with a few microseconds higher propagation delay
   when compared to delay-minimized provisioning. Furthermore, its low
   channel utilization in the IP over WDM transport network, as well as its
   fairness among the nodes in terms of power consumption, makes DePoMiP a
   promising solution for the problem of energy-efficient reconfiguration
   of the cloud network.}},

Abstract = {{We present in this paper three Bluetooth Scatternet Formation (BSF)
   algorithms which forms deterministically connected and outdegree limited
   scatternets. Our algorithms improve the execution time of algorithm
   BlueMIS, which consists of two consecutive phases called BlueMIS I and
   BlueMIS II. The first phase, BlueMIS I, is a BSF algorithm that forms
   connected and outdegree limited scatternets in a time-efficient manner.
   Our algorithms improve BlueMIS by improving BlueMIS I. First, we
   introduce a time-efficient implementation of communication rounds,
   called OrderedExchange, that is more suitable for Bluetooth networks,
   where in a communication round each node sends and receives a message to
   and from all its neighbors. Using OrderedExchange, we introduce
   algorithms ComputeMIS I and ComputeMIS II which form the same scatternet
   as those formed by BlueMIS I but with less execution time. We also
   introduce algorithm Eliminate. Instead of letting each node u forms a
   maximal independent set of all its neighbors and then considers them as
   slaves, as in the case of BlueMIS I, Eliminate let each node u forms a
   maximal independent set of all its neighbors that have smaller
   identifiers. Eliminate forms scatternets that are similiar to those
   formed by BlueMIS I, and more efficient with respect to some performance
   metrics. Eliminate improves the execution time of ComputeMIS I and
   ComputeMIS II by about 60\%.}},

Abstract = {{Significant portion of the energy consumption of the optical networks is
   expected to be in the transport segment. Besides its improved bandwidth
   utilization advantage, multi-granular switching concept further helps
   rectifying the energy bottleneck problem in the backbone. One of the
   important challenges faced by the multi-granular optical networks is the
   optical reach enforcement. In this paper, we compare the multi-granular
   optical network design to the conventional Wavelength Division
   Multiplexing (WDM)-based network design by enforcing the optical reach
   limitation as a design constraint. We introduce the heuristics to solve
   the Routing and Multi-Granular Path Assignment (RMGPA) problem. Our
   simulation results show that multi-granular optical network design
   outperforms the WDM-based network design in terms of Operational
   Expenditure (Opex) as it significantly reduces the power consumption in
   the backbone. Furthermore, through simulations, we show that the green
   multi-granular design is efficient in terms of the Capital Expenditure
   (Capex) as the network cost is also degraded.}},

Abstract = {{In the cloud computing era, virtualized data centers are expected to
   host most of the cloud services such as computation, storage and
   multimedia applications. Cloud services are expected to be transported
   over the Internet backbone based on anycast/manycast paradigms between
   the users and data centers. In this paper, we present an optimization
   model which aims at reconfiguring the cloud network topology so that the
   delay of cloud service provisioning is minimized without disrupting the
   service quality of regular Internet services. We compare the performance
   of the proposed model to the delay performance of an optimization model
   which aims at minimizing the operational expenditure of the operator.
   Through numerical results, we show that the proposed optimization model
   is capable of assuring minimum delay guarantee for the traffic demands
   destined to/from the data centers, as well as the traffic demands
   destined to/from the core nodes of the cloud network. Furthermore, we
   study the overheads and challenges of delay minimized reconfiguration of
   the cloud network. Numerical results confirm that minimum delay
   objective does not introduce significant overhead to the data centers in
   terms of operational expenditure, namely power consumption. On the other
   hand, we show that the increase in the power consumption of the network
   equipment in the cloud backbone arises as an important challenge of the
   presented optimization model.}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{25}},
Pages = {{1-16}},
Abstract = {{Nonlinear boundary-layer receptivity to pairs of unsteady oblique
   freestream vortical modes is studied in direct numerical simulation of
   flow over a flat plate with an elliptic leading edge. The freestream is
   perturbed by three types of oblique Fourier modes, differing in the
   magnitude of the three vorticity components. The vortical modes excite
   steady boundary-layer streaks. The associated receptivity mechanism,
   described in detail, is quadratic in the forcing amplitude. Elliptic
   leading edges with two different aspect ratios are considered. We find
   that - and explain why - the streak amplitudes in nonlinear receptivity
   are largely unaffected by the leading-edge bluntness for the types of
   external disturbances studied. As linear receptivity is the predominant
   mechanism at low forcing frequencies, the nonlinear mechanism comes into
   play when high-frequency vortices are present in the freestream.
   Nonlinear receptivity is therefore expected to contribute to the
   excitation of boundary-layer streaks by freestream turbulence.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an architecture to define and disseminate
   heterogeneous data between multiple participants in real-time using the
   IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) with Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
   development platforms. IMS is a communications framework permitting the
   exchange of data between communications devices across divergent
   networks. Mechanisms are defined in IMS for users to create
   subscriptions to receive data from multiple participants. Users are
   limited to the types of data that can be received through a subscription
   and no known mechanisms are available to control the rate at which data
   may be received. This paper presents an architecture to address these
   issues by permitting users to describe the means through which
   heterogeneous data can be transmitted. Modifications are introduced to
   the IMS subscription mechanism increasing the efficiency of data
   delivery through the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). These changes
   are implemented into a FPGA platform so data may be exchanged through
   IMS while limiting performance bottlenecks as much as possible.}},

Abstract = {{A wearable mobility monitoring system (WMMS) could be a valuable device
   for rehabilitation decision-making. A proof-of-concept system is
   developed that uses the BlackBerry 9550 as a self-contained WMMS
   platform. An integrated tri-axial accelerometer, GPS, and timing data
   are processed to identify the mobility change-of-state (CoS) between
   standing, walking, sitting, lying, stair climbing, going up or down a
   ramp, riding an elevator, and riding in a car. Following feature
   extraction from the sensor data, a decision tree is used to distinguish
   the CoS. In the complete system, real-time CoS identification on the
   smartphone will trigger video capture for improved mobility context
   analysis. Preliminary evaluation involved collecting three trials from
   one subject while he completed a continuous circuit that incorporated
   all target mobility tasks. The average sensitivity is 89.7 \% and the
   specificity is 99.5 \% for walking-related activities. The sensitivity
   is 72.2 \% for stair navigation and 33.3\% for ramp recognition, since
   accelerations for a ramp gait are similar to those for a walking gait.
   These results provide insight into algorithms and features that can be
   used to recognize CoS in real-time.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ANTENNAS AND WIRELESS PROPAGATION LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{A full-wave receive-mode analysis is used to show that it is the shift
   in the location of the focal point with frequency (caused by nonconstant
   path delays over the surface of the reflectarray) that is principally
   responsible for the beam squint that occurs in offset-fed reflectarray
   antennas, and not the element type used or the lattice size. A similar
   transmit-mode analysis confirms that it is this focal point shift that
   implies noncoincidence of the focal point and the feed phase center at
   off-center frequencies, which results in a phase distribution over the
   reflectarray aperture with a slope other than that required to have the
   main beam in the desired direction. We further demonstrate this fact
   (computationally and experimentally) by showing that if the feed is
   physically moved to the shifted focal point at some off-center
   frequency, the main beam pointing direction at this frequency is
   restored.}},

Pages = {{714-733}},
Abstract = {{Long-reach Passive Optical Networks (LR-PONs) aim to combine the
   capacity of metro and access networks by extending the reach and split
   ratio of the conventional PONs. LR-PONs appear as efficient solutions
   having feeder distances around 100km and high split ratios up to
   1000-way. On the other hand, transmission of the signals in long
   distances up to 100km leads to increased propagation delay whereas high
   split ratio may lead to long cycle times resulting in large queue
   occupancies and long packet delays. Before LR-PON becomes widely
   adopted, the trade-off between the advantages and performance
   degradation problem which is resulting from long reach and high split
   ratio properties of LR-PONs needs to be solved. Recent studies have
   focused on enhancing the performance of dynamic bandwidth allocation in
   LR-PONs. This article presents a comprehensive survey on the dynamic
   bandwidth allocation schemes for LR-PONs. In the article, a comparative
   classification of the proposed schemes based on their quality-of-service
   awareness, base-types, feeder distances and tested performance metrics
   is provided. At the end of the article, a brief discussion on the open
   issues and research challenges for the solution of performance
   degradation in LR-PONs is presented.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we explore the task of mood classification for blog
   postings. We propose a novel approach that uses the hierarchy of
   possible moods to achieve better results than a standard machine
   learning approach. We also show that using sentiment orientation
   features improves the performance of classification. We used the
   Livejournal blog corpus as a data set to train and evaluate our method.
   We present extensive error analysis and discuss the difficulty of the
   task.}},

Abstract = {{Injectable hydrogels are increasingly being developed for biomedical
   applications due to their ability to be delivered in a minimally
   invasive manner. One potential use for such materials is in cell
   delivery for cardiac regeneration. While the materials' properties are
   often characterized, how these properties (and in particular gelation)
   are affected by the addition of the therapeutic agent(s) they are
   designed to deliver is often overlooked. The aim of this study was to
   examine the interactive effects between collagen-based hydrogels and
   different additives (cells and microspheres). The results demonstrated
   that the incorporation of either cells or microspheres to a collagen
   hydrogel decreased its gelation time and increased its viscosity.
   Increased concentrations of the EDC/NHS cross-linker resulted in greater
   loss of cell viability. However, it was found that this cell loss could
   be minimized by delivering cells with the cross-linker scavenger
   glycine. A better understanding of how materials and cells (and other
   additives) respond to each other will help towards the goal of improving
   scaffolds being developed for regenerative therapy. (C) Koninklijke

   formulation of the Level Set technique was extended and then implemented
   into a coronal plane model of the proximal femur to simulate the

   optimal state. Results indicated that the proposed approach could
   reasonably mimic the major geometrical and material features of the
   natural bone. Simulation of the internal bone remodelling on the typical
   gross shape of the proximal femur, resulted in a density distribution
   pattern with good consistency with that of the natural bone. When both
   external and internal bone remodelling were simulated simultaneously,
   the initial rectangular design domain with a regularly distributed mass
   reduced gradually to an optimal state with external shape and internal
   structure similar to those of the natural proximal femur.}},

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on the properties of an MFI-type zeolite
   (silicalite-1) membrane synthesized on a novel tubular support with a
   0.45 mu m-pore size active layer consisting of zirconium and titanium
   oxides. Even though the membrane was synthesized by a pore plugging
   method, apart from penetrating into the support, the silicalite-1
   crystals formed a 1.5 mu m layer on top of the support. After the
   zeolite synthesis, the Si constituted more than 35\% of the active layer
   of the support, which implies small size and close packing of the
   silicalite-1 crystals in the pores of the active layer.
   Single gas permeation tests with N-2 and CO2 revealed comparable N-2 and
   CO2 permeances. On the other hand, CO2/N-2 gas separation tests
   performed at different total feed pressures and feed compositions lead
   to CO2/N-2 permselectivities as high as 26.0, with the corresponding CO2
   permeance of 6 x 10(-8) mol/m(2) Pa s. The effects of changing the
   partial pressure gradient of CO2 across the membrane by means of varying
   the total feed pressure and the feed composition on the CO2 permeance
   and CO2/N-2 permselectivity are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical oxidation (decolorization/degradation) of blue and red

   investigated in the electro-Fenton reaction on BDD. Progress of dyes
   degradation during the electrolysis and electro-Fenton reaction was
   monitored by UV-visible absorption and by estimation of the chemical
   oxygen demand (COD). Direct electrolysis showed a limiting capacity for
   red and blue dye removal even at high current densities, e. g. maximum
   red color and COD removal were 70 and 20\%, respectively at 30 mA cm(-2)
   after 300 min. Higher red and blue color removal efficiencies were
   achieved by electro-Fenton oxidation. Current density of 30 mA cm(-2) in
   the presence of 0.05 mmol/L of FeSO4 resulted in the red color and COD
   removal of 98 and 96\%, respectively. The optimum FeSO4 concentration
   for the electro-Fenton reaction was determined to be 0.05 mmol/L.
   Instantaneous current efficiency (ICE) in the presence of FeSO4 was

Abstract = {{This paper outlines the experimental methods and results obtained from
   the testing of asymmetric gold surface plasmon waveguide detectors on an
   epitaxial silicon structure at optical wavelengths of 1550 nm and 1310
   nm. Using end-fire coupling, responsivities of up to 0.88 mA/W at a 100
   mV reverse bias were measured. The photo-detection mechanism is based on
   the internal photoelectric effect. The simple and compact design allow
   for these devices to be integrated and densely populated with Si-based
   optoelectronics. The ability to detect wavelengths below the bandgap of
   Si is also appealing. 2D responsivity maps are generated using
   piezoelectric positioners controlled using Labview.}},

Abstract = {{In radio frequency identifications (RFIDs), an idle slot can be
   interrupted by the reader and takes less time than the other slots. In
   this case, the widely used binary splitting (BS) protocol is not
   optimal. M-ary splitting (M > 2) with a carefully selected M outperforms
   BS, because it can take into account smaller duration of the idle slots.
   In this paper, we provide optimal value of M(M-opt) for varying slot
   sizes that yields minimum identification time. The proposed scheme is
   called optimal splitting (OS). We also revise OS to deal with mobile
   tags and propose the optimal splitting with arrival tags blocking
   (OS-ATB) protocol. Extensive simulations show that OS and OS-ATB
   consistently yield better performance than the other splitting and
   tree-based schemes.
   Note to Practitioners-An RFID reader can interrupt the slot in which no
   tags reply for a predefined time interval, resulting in an short idle
   slot. In this case, binary splitting is not the best choice but simple
   increase of the splitting level can yield much better performance. Since
   the slot sizes are usually fixed for a given system, the optimum value
   can be calculated offline without introducing extra computation
   complexity during the real-time identification.}},

Title = {{Multiobjective Optimization of an Industrial Styrene Reactor Using the
   Dual Population Evolutionary Algorithm (DPEA)}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL REACTOR ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{10}},
Abstract = {{In the last few years, multiobjective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs)
   have gained significant interest as a reliable option to optimize
   problems with conflicting objectives in science and engineering. These
   algorithms generate an optimal set of trade-off solutions referred to as
   the Pareto domain. In this investigation, a MOEA was used to optimize
   simultaneously conflicting design variables of an industrial styrene
   reactor. The dual population evolutionary algorithm (DPEA) was
   implemented to optimize the productivity, yield, and selectivity of
   styrene. To evaluate the robustness and versatility of the algorithm,
   two and three objective optimization case studies were conducted for
   three different configurations of the reactor: adiabatic,
   steam-injected, and isothermal.
   Results indicated that DPEA is a robust optimization strategy to
   generate a well-defined Pareto domain with a wide range of solutions. In
   addition, the Pareto-optimal solutions of the steam-injected
   configuration were superior to the adiabatic reactor and to a portion of
   the isothermal configuration. The optimal operating conditions
   corresponding to the Pareto domains were also slightly better in terms
   of profit when compared with previously published studies. The Pareto
   domains were then ranked using the Net Flow Method (NFM), a ranking
   algorithm that incorporates the knowledge and preferences of an expert
   into the optimization routine.}},

Abstract = {{The tsunami hazard for the east coast of India is assessed. The
   Sumatra-Andaman 1300 km long fault is divided into five segments, each
   segment assumed to have different fault parameters. The initial vertical
   displacement of the sea bottom is calculated with the Mansinha and
   Smylie algorithm. Modeling of tsunami amplitude, travel time, run-up and
   directivity has been done. We compared simulated tsunami travel times
   and elevation with data measured at tide gauges and coastal runup. The
   model results show that the distribution of maximum amplitude in the
   Indian Ocean basin is primarily controlled by the classical effects of
   the directivity and by refraction and focusing along bathymetric
   features. The results suggest 7-8 m run up height at Nagapatanam, Tamil

   energetic materials with high reactivity, vanishing porosity, structural
   integrity and arbitrary shape. The experiments have focused on the Ni-Al

   achieved by the ball milling technique. The consolidation of the
   materials used the supersonic cold gas spray technique, where the
   particles are accelerated to high speeds and consolidated via plastic
   deformation upon impact, forming activated nanocomposites in arbitrary
   shapes with close to zero porosity. This technique permits to retain the
   microstructures in the powders and prevents any reactions during the
   consolidation phase. The material reactivity is addressed through the
   flame propagation velocity, which showed an increase in the flame speed
   of the cold sprayed samples by up to one order of magnitude compared to
   their cold pressed counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{When a strong shock propagates through a medium with internal degrees of
   freedom, the thermal equilibration involves the transfer of the
   mechanical energy imparted by the shock to the medium's internal modes.
   In gases, for example, this energy relaxation within the shock structure
   involves the re-distribution of the translational thermal energy of the
   molecules into rotational, vibrational, and electronic modes via
   inelastic collisions. In the present work, using a toy molecular model,
   we study the dynamics of shock waves driven through such a dissipative
   gas, characterized by inelastic collisions. The medium is modelled as a
   system of hard disks (2D) undergoing either elastic or inelastic
   collisions. Inelastic collisions are only allowed if the amplitude of
   the collision exceeds a certain activation threshold. When the medium
   allows finite dissipation, we find that the shock waves are unstable and
   form distinctive high density non-uniformities and convective rolls on
   their surface. The results obtained may shed light on the instabilities
   observed experimentally behind strong shock waves triggering ionization,
   vibrational relaxation and dissociation.}},

Abstract = {{Taking inspiration from the significantly superior performance of humans
   to extract and interpret visual information, the exploitation of
   biological visual mechanisms can contribute to the improvement of the
   performance of computational image processing systems. Computational
   models of visual attention have already been shown to significantly
   improve the speed of scene understanding by attending only the regions
   of interest, while distributing the resources where they are required.
   However, there are only few attention-based computational systems that
   have been used in practical applications dealing with real data and up
   to now, none of the computational attention models was demonstrated to
   work under a wide range of image content, characteristics and scales
   such as those encountered in satellite imaging. This paper outlines some
   of the difficulties that the current generation of visual
   attention-inspired models encounter when dealing with satellite images.
   It then proposes a novel algorithm for automatic image segmentation and
   regions of interest search that combines elements of human visual
   attention with Legendre moments applied on the probability density
   function of color histograms. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the proposed approach obtains better results than one of the most
   evolved current computational attention model proposed in the
   literature.}},

   behavior. Often laser vibrometers are used for vibration measurements.
   But this point should be considered that method utilization because of

   problem several other methods were recommended such as Near Field
   Acoustical Holography and Inverse Numerical Acoustics. Vibrational
   properties knowledge helps in design, control and reduce undesirable

   errors. The aim of this paper is the presentation of an efficient method
   using acoustics that can obtain vibrational properties by measuring
   other quantities, like fluid pressure dynamics somewhere near the

Abstract = {{A key problem in telepresence systems is how to effectively emulate the
   subjective experience of being there delivered by our visual system. A
   step toward visual realism can be achieved by using high-quality
   panoramic snapshots instead of computer-based models of the scene.
   Furthermore, a better immersive illusion can be created by enabling the
   free viewpoint stereoscopic navigation of the scene, i.e. using
   omnistereoscopic imaging. However, commonly found implementation
   constraints of telepresence systems such as acquisition time, rendering
   complexity, and storage capacity, make the idea of using stereoscopic
   panoramas challenging. Having these constraints in mind, we developed a
   technique for the efficient acquisition and rendering of
   omnistereoscopic images based on sampling the scene with clusters of
   three panoramic images arranged in a controlled geometric pattern. Our
   technique can be implemented with any off-the-shelf panoramic cameras.
   Furthermore, it does not require neither the acquisition of additional
   depth information of the scene nor the estimation of camera parameters.
   The low the computational complexity and reduced data overhead of our
   rendering process make it attractive for the large scale stereoscopic
   sampling in a variety of scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The present work explores the feasibility of using surface enhanced
   Raman scattering (SERS) for detecting the neurotransmitters such as
   glutamate (GLU) and gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA). These amino acid
   neurotransmitters that respectively mediate fast excitatory and
   inhibitory neurotransmission in the brain, are important for
   neuroendocrine control, and upsets in their synthesis are also linked to
   epilepsy. Our SERS-based detection scheme enabled the detection of low
   amounts of GLU (10(-7) M) and GABA (10(-4) M). It may complement
   existing techniques for characterizing such kinds of neurotransmitters
   that include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or mass
   spectrography (MS). This is mainly because SERS has other advantages
   such as ease of sample preparation, molecular specificity and
   sensitivity, thus making it potentially applicable to characterization
   of experimental brain extracts or clinical diagnostic samples of
   cerebrospinal fluid and saliva. Using hollow core photonic crystal fiber
   (HC-PCF) further enhanced the Raman signal relative to that in a
   standard cuvette providing sensitive detection of GLU and GABA in
   micro-litre volume of aqueous solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Transient state swelling behavior and swelling kinetics of novel
   stimuli-responsive polyglycerol hydrogels were studied at 293, 310 and
   333 K. Depending on temperature, Fickian or anomalous diffusion behavior
   was observed. Mechanical properties of the hydrogels in the swollen and
   dry states were investigated and the average molecular weight between
   crosslinks was calculated. To assess the potential for biodegradation of
   hydrogels, initial swelling behavior in phosphate buffered saline (PBS)
   solution and mass loss profiles as a function of degradation time were
   investigated over a period of 30 days. All swelling behavior, mechanical
   properties and degradations were clearly affected by the degree of
   cross-linking. The hydrophilicity and biodegradability of polyglycerol
   hydrogels make them suitable for pharmaceutical, biomedical and

Abstract = {{Pellets from natural and acetified Havelock limestone were synthesized
   and tested for in situ post-combustion CO2 capture in Ca-looping cycles.
   Natural kaolin and Al(OH)(3) obtained from acid leaching of kaolin were
   used as binders. The results showed that after 30 cycles, pellets
   prepared from acetified limestone with 10 vol.\% acetic acid and
   CaO/Al(OH)(3) mass ratio of 5.5 had a somewhat higher CO2 uptake of 0.13
   g/g (g CO2/g sorbent), compared to 0.12 g/g for pellets prepared from
   natural limestone and Al(OH)(3). These uptakes corresponded to 56\% and
   36.7\% of their initial capture capacities, respectively. By contrast,
   natural sorbent and pellets prepared with kaolin demonstrated a
   significant decay in their CO2 uptake down to 21\% and 21.7\% of their
   initial capacities, respectively. The superiority of acetified sorbents
   with Al(OH)(3) binders appears to be due to the creation of a highly
   developed porous structure. In particular, alpha-Al2O3 generated from
   Al(OH)(3) appears to create a stable framework dominated by mesopores,
   which also inhibits sintering over multiple cycles. However,
   acetification itself widens pores and alters pore surface area and
   volume, providing more space for CaCO3 growth. Unfortunately, water
   addition during pellet synthesis appears to compromise this porous
   structure, thus reducing the original benefits of acetification. (C)

Abstract = {{Mobile users and applications are putting pressure on wireless network
   operators to improve the seamless handover of devices and services.
   Strong business competition for subscribers, along with the ever

   handover decisions. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of
   the literature on mobility management architectures for seamless
   handover of mobile users in heterogeneous networks. We describe the
   design rationale for selected architectures, with an in-depth analysis
   of their main goals, assumptions, and requirements. We also provide
   directions for further work in this field by highlighting the mandatory
   requirements and the features of future architectures. We then present a
   new architecture called Context-Aware Mobility Management System
   (CAMMS). CAMMS is a new cross-layer, context-aware and interactive
   approach to seamless handover of users and services. With that proposal,
   we identified the essential functional entities that must be part of

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to assess issues related to the usage of
   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for certain mining
   services applications. In addition, it discusses current RFID solutions
   and inventions related to mining services applications. Main goals of
   this study are to investigate if RFID technology is suitable for
   inventory management of detonators and boosters, security, tracing of
   explosives and detonators, and retrieval of the assembly from the blast
   debris in the event of a misfire. Attempt has been made to address the
   best RFID solution for the same. IEEE 1902.1(RuBee) technology may show
   great potential in this field since it can achieve long reading ranges
   and it is not affected by proximity of rocks or metals. A hybrid
   solution that incorporates both near-field and far-field capabilities
   may be reliable for reading all the boosters and detonators at
   predefined locations. The safety facets for using RFID with the
   explosives and in hazardous areas are also highlighted. (C) 2011

   has the highest catalytic activity toward CO oxidation among the studied
   catalysts. Decrease in the average particle size of Pt/YSZ led to the
   increase in CO conversion at low temperatures. Enhanced performances can
   be explained by the thermally induced O2- backspillover from YSZ over Pt
   nanoparticles in agreement with the electrochemical promotion mechanism.

Abstract = {{A method for chemically differentiating the surface of a set of small,
   closely-spaced, lithographically-defined Au features on a die, from
   another set of similar features intimately inter-dispersed, is
   described. The key enabler of the method is a standard electronics probe
   array adapted to carry out electrochemistry on the features. The probe
   array is used first to verify the electrical integrity of features and
   the quality of electrical contacts by measuring electrical resistance,
   then, in the presence of the electrolyte, simultaneously maintain one
   potential on one set of Au features and another potential on the other
   set in order to carry out desired electrochemical reactions. The
   technique was demonstrated on dies bearing 40 electrically isolated Au
   features (based on 5 mu m wide stripes) accessed via 64 contact pads
   each 100x100 mu m(2) in area. The array had 64 probes, of which 16 were
   maintained at a desorbing potential (-1.6 V vs. Ag/AgCl) and 48 at a
   stability potential (-0.3 V). The surface compositions were analyzed
   with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry by imaging ion
   fragments characteristic to the thiols forming SAMs, thereby validating
   the process. (C) 2012 The Electrochemical Society. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Current mobile agent algorithms for mapping faults in computer networks
   assume that the network is static. However, for large classes of highly
   dynamic networks (e.g., wireless mobile ad hoc networks, sensor
   networks, vehicular networks), the topology changes as a function of
   time. These networks, called delay-tolerant, challenged, opportunistic,
   etc., have never been investigated with regard to locating faults. We
   consider a subclass of these networks modeled on an urban subway system.
   We examine the problem of creating a map of such a subway. More
   precisely, we study the problem of a team of asynchronous computational
   entities (the mapping agents) determining the location of black holes in
   a highly dynamic graph, whose edges are defined by the asynchronous
   movements of mobile entities (the subway carriers). We determine
   necessary conditions for the problem to be solvable. We then present and
   analyze a solution protocol; we show that our algorithm solves the fault
   mapping problem in subway networks with the minimum number of agents
   possible, k = gamma + 1, where gamma is the number of carrier stops at
   black holes. The number of carrier moves between stations required by
   the algorithm in the worst case is O(k center dot n(C)(2) center dot
   l(R) + n(C) center dot l(R)(2)), where nC is the number of subway
   trains, and l(R) is the length of the subway route with the most stops.
   We establish lower bounds showing that this bound is tight. Thus, our
   protocol is both agent-optimal and move-optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Combining higher-order abstract syntax and (co)-induction in a logical
   framework is well known to be problematic. We describe the theory and
   the practice of a tool called Hybrid, within Isabelle/HOL and Coq, which
   aims to address many of these difficulties. It allows object logics to
   be represented using higher-order abstract syntax, and reasoned about
   using tactical theorem proving and principles of (co)induction.
   Moreover, it is definitional, which guarantees consistency within a
   classical type theory. The idea is to have a de Bruijn representation of
   lambda-terms providing a definitional layer that allows the user to
   represent object languages using higher-order abstract syntax, while
   offering tools for reasoning about them at the higher level. In this
   paper we describe how to use Hybrid in a multi-level reasoning fashion,
   similar in spirit to other systems such as Twelf and Abella. By
   explicitly referencing provability in a middle layer called a
   specification logic, we solve the problem of reasoning by (co)induction
   in the presence of non-stratifiable hypothetical judgments, which allow
   very elegant and succinct specifications of object logic inference
   rules. We first demonstrate the method on a simple example, formally
   proving type soundness (subject reduction) for a fragment of a pure
   functional language, using a minimal intuitionistic logic as the
   specification logic. We then prove an analogous result for a
   continuation-machine presentation of the operational semantics of the
   same language, encoded this time in an ordered linear logic that serves
   as the specification layer. This example demonstrates the ease with
   which we can incorporate new specification logics, and also illustrates
   a significantly more complex object logic whose encoding is elegantly
   expressed using features of the new specification logic.}},

Title = {{Multidimensional Wave Field Signal Theory: Transfer Function
   Relationships}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{The transmission of information by propagating or diffusive waves is
   common to many fields of engineering and physics. Such physical
   phenomena are governed by a Helmholtz (real wavenumber) or
   pseudo-Helmholtz (complex wavenumber) equation. Since these equations
   are linear, it would be useful to be able to use tools fromsignal theory
   in solving related problems. The aim of this paper is to derive
   multidimensional input/output transfer function relationships in the
   spatial domain for these equations in order to permit such a signal
   theoretic approach to problem solving. This paper presents such transfer
   function relationships for the spatial (not Fourier) domain within
   appropriate coordinate systems. It is shown that the relationships
   assume particularly simple and computationally useful forms once the
   appropriate curvilinear version of a multidimensional spatial Fourier
   transform is used. These results are shown for both real and complex
   wavenumbers. Fourier inversion of these formulas would have applications
   for tomographic problems in various modalities. In the case of real

Abstract = {{In the companion paper, Seidou et al. (2011, submitted) have shown that
   when adequate meteorological data are available to calibrate
   rainfall-runoff models, using a non-stationary GEV model with the
   simulated flows can provide a better description of flood peaks
   distributions than directly using the simulated peaks. Their methodology
   is extended in this paper to improve future flood peaks simulation under
   a changing climate. In this case, the rainfall-runoff model is forced
   with the downscaled outputs of the Canadian General Circulation Model
   CGCM3. Special attention is paid to the statistical downscaling of
   precipitations, as the choice of the transfer function has a significant
   influence on the performance of non-stationary GEV model. Stepwise
   regression was initially used to describe precipitation occurrence and
   intensity, but the patterns of the simulated hydrographs were found to
   be unsatisfactory. After precipitation occurrence model was successfully
   replaced with an ensemble of regression trees, the non-stationary GEV
   model was shown to provide a better description of flood peaks in the
   observation period. The non-stationary GEV model shows that exceedance
   probabilities on the Kemptville Creek will gradually rise up to 34\%
   above current levels in 2100 for a 20-year service life.}},

Abstract = {{Amplifiers and lasers based on surface plasmon-polaritons (SPPs) have

   various systems involving single-interface, long-range, short-range and

   stripes, wires and particles (some on the nanoscale) have been
   integrated with gain materials. Although the prospects for SPP
   amplifiers and lasers are bright, the field is embryonic, and much
   remains to be explored and improved. This Review discusses this rapidly

Abstract = {{Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) access networks aim at combining the flexibility,
   ubiquity and mobility of wireless access networks with the robustness
   and high capacity support of the optical access networks. Several
   bandwidth allocation algorithms have been proposed for the convergence
   of fiber and wireless access networks. Besides, fiber-wireless
   convergence, metro-access convergence and energy-efficiency have
   appeared as further challenges of the ICTs. In this paper, we report our
   current research results on the service quality of existing
   energy-efficient bandwidth allocation schemes in long-reach FiWi
   networks, in terms of detailed delay performance, fairness and
   utilization. We show that deployment of energy-efficient Dynamic
   Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) in a FiWi network does not only guarantee
   energy savings throughout the day but also introduces reduced maximum
   packet delay for both FTTX and wireless users, enhanced delay variance
   for all packets and significant fairness among different parts of the
   network. Furthermore, energy-efficient DBA decreases average buffer
   occupancy at the ONUs.}},

Abstract = {{Access networks form a large portion of today's telecom networks. In
   parallel to their scale, they have high energy consumption. To reduce
   the energy consumption of access networks, energy saving architectures
   and protocols have been proposed. Recently, new technologies have
   emerged for optical access networks such as Long-Reach Passive Optical
   Networks (LR-PONs) and Fiber-Wireless (FiWi) networks where their
   convergence offers extended reach and coverage. In this paper, we
   evaluate packet delay performance and energy-savings in metro-access
   convergence where Long-Reach EPON (LR-EPON) and Long Term
   Evolution-Advanced (LTE-) technologies are employed. Through
   simulations, we show that energy-efficient protocol solutions for the
   conventional fiber-wireless access networks can still guarantee
   significant energy savings for a metro-access convergent infrastructure.
   However, in the extended reach, a trade-off between energy efficiency
   and delay is observed.}},

Abstract = {{in this paper, we proposed a number of innovative models for
   PON/radio-over-fiber PON (RoF-PON) according to the ITU-T G.983.1
   recommendations along with their m-trail design solutions. The RoF-PON
   system is based on our novel millimeter-waveband (mm-WB) RoF
   architecture for wireless services. We presented two architecture
   schemes for m-trail deployment: (1) by setting up the m-trails in
   addition/on the top of the operating lightpaths, this is the case which
   a clear separation between monitoring and operation functions is
   required, (2) by using a certain number of the existing light paths that
   are already deployed in the network at the normal operating condition as
   optical monitoring paths. The comparison between these two architecture
   schemes is based on network resources consumption in terms of the number
   of lightpaths that are needed to be deployed to achieve network
   survivability.}},

Abstract = {{Sleep is state of rest necessary for human wellbeing and survival. Low
   quality sleep during the night affects human performance during the day
   and can lead to serious illnesses and disorders. In this paper we
   propose a multimodal system that monitors the quality of sleep and
   adapts the ambient environment where user sleeps in order to optimize
   the sleeping conditions and eventually the quality of sleep. The system
   generates a sleep record that contains a sleep quality index based on
   multiple biofeedback measurement from user. A feasibly study with sixty
   subjects is conducted to shape the system requirements and meet user
   expectations. The results showed that more than eighty percent of the
   participants realize the need for the proposed system and want the
   system to generate a sleep record and to control the ambient
   environment. Only five percent of the participants disagree that the
   system would improve the quality of sleep.}},

Abstract = {{It is well established that acquiring large amount of data can quickly
   lead to important data management challenges where processing
   capabilities become saturated and preempt full usage of the information
   available for autonomous systems to make educated decisions. While
   sub-sampling offers a naive solution for reducing dataset dimension, it
   does not capitalize on the knowledge available in already acquired data
   to selectively drive further acquisition over the most significant
   regions. This paper discusses the development of a probabilistic
   occupancy grid based algorithm to automatically establish which regions
   within a single point of view from a range sensor would provide the most
   improvement if further acquisitions were made. The algorithm, which is
   independent of the sensor used, is validated with range data acquired
   from the popular Kinect multi-modal imaging sensor.}},

Abstract = {{As is known, there exist usually unreliable factors in open
   communication links, such as time delays and communication failures.
   When open communication infrastructures are embedded into modern power
   system to support vast amounts of data exchange, it becomes more
   challenging to keep the complex power system reliable and stable. In
   this paper, the modeling and robust controller design problems of load
   frequency control (LFC) are investigated for power system with
   communication delays. In specific, we consider a general case that there
   exist time varying delays in two channels. One is the feed-forward
   channel in which control centers send control signals to remote terminal
   units (RTUs). The other one is the feedback channel where measurement
   signals are transmitted from RTUs to the control centers. The state
   space models of LFC including two channel time varying delays are
   presented. Based on Lyapunov-krasovskii stability theory, a delay
   dependant controller is designed to compensate performance degradation
   brought by time varying delays. Two-area LFC model is used to conduct
   case studies. The dynamic performances are compared between conventional
   PI controller and the proposed delay dependant for LFC with and without
   time varying delays. It is shown that the proposed controller can keep
   the power system robustly stable even when there are time varying delays
   in both channels mentioned in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Random Sampling Consensus (RANSAC) is a standard tool in various

   improvement to RANSAC where regression diagnostics information is
   incorporated in RANSAC in order to improve accuracy and speed. The
   improvement in the sampling stage speeds up the estimation by taking
   advantage of a priori information driven from regression diagnostics.
   Also, a new stopping criterion is presented that enables a much higher
   speed in the estimation process and guarantees that the iterative
   estimation is stopped as soon as the best model is found. In addition,
   the proposed method can easily be combined with existing randomized
   hypothesis verification techniques to achieve an even higher accuracy
   and speed. The algorithm is tested extensively on synthetic data and the
   results show a marked improvement in the accuracy of the estimation and
   a speed up of more than three times over the traditional RANSAC.}},

Abstract = {{Validation should be done in the context of understanding how a business
   process is intended to contribute to the business strategies of an
   organization. Validation can take place along a variety of dimensions
   including legal compliance, financial cost, customer value, and service
   quality. A business process modeling tool cannot anticipate all the ways
   in which a business process might need to be validated. However, it can
   provide a framework for extending model elements to represent context
   for a business process. It can also support information exchange to
   facilitate validation with other tools and systems. This chapter
   demonstrates a model-based approach to validation using a hospital
   approval process for accessing patient data in a data warehouse. An
   extensible meta-model, a flexible data exchange layer, and linkage
   between business processes and enterprise context are shown to be the
   critical elements in model-based business process validation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new approach using data mining techniques, and in
   particular a two-stage architecture, for classification of Peer-to-Peer
   (P2P) traffic in IP networks where in the first stage the traffic is
   filtered using standard port numbers and layer 4 port matching to label
   well-known P2P and NonP2P traffic. The labeled traffic produced in the
   first stage is used to train a Fast Decision Tree (FDT) classifier with
   high accuracy. The Unknown traffic is then applied to the FDT model
   which classifies the traffic into P2P and NonP2P with high accuracy. The
   two-stage architecture not only classifies well-known P2P applications,
   but also classifies applications that use random or non-standard port
   numbers and cannot be classified otherwise. The authors captured the
   internet traffic at a gateway router, performed pre-processing on the
   data, selected the most significant attributes, and prepared a training
   data set to which the new algorithm was applied. Finally, the authors
   built several models using a combination of various attribute sets for
   different ratios of P2P to NonP2P traffic in the training data.}},

Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in Long-Range Surface Plasmon-Polariton
   (LRSPP) waves, which inherently have a low attenuation, for sensing
   applications. LRSPPs propagating along thin metal stripes arranged as
   integrated optical structures, such as Mach-Zehnder interferometers
   (MZIs), are or particular interest for biosensing. In order for sensors
   to be functional, high-quality metal stripe waveguides integrated with
   microfluidic channels are required. Wafer-based fabrication processes
   have been developed and implemented to fabricate thin (35 nm) Au stripes
   and features embedded into CYTOP claddings, with etched microfluidic
   channels exposing sections of the stripes for sensing. CYTOP is a
   fluoropolymer having a refractive index close to that of water,
   motivating its use as a cladding material. The fabrication processes
   developed are discussed and measurements (physical and optical) on
   operating sensors are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Optical fields that are periodic in the transverse plane self-image
   periodically as they propagate along the optical axis: a phenomenon
   known as the Talbot effect. A transfer matrix may be defined that
   relates the amplitude and phase of point sources placed on a particular
   grid at the input to their respective multiple images at an image plane.
   The free-space Talbot effect may be mapped to the waveguide Talbot
   effect. Applying this mapping to the transfer matrix enables the
   prediction of the phase and amplitude relations between the ports of a
   Multimode Interference (MMI) coupler-a planar waveguide device. The
   transfer matrix approach has not previously been applied to the
   free-space case and its mapping to the waveguide case provides greater
   clarity and physical insight into the phase relationships than previous
   treatments.
   The paper first introduces the underlying physics of the Talbot effect
   in free space with emphasis on the positions along the optical axis at
   which images occur; their multiplicity; and their relative phase
   relations determined by the Gauss Quadratic Sum of number theory. The
   analysis is then adapted to predict the phase relationships between the
   ports of an MMI. These phase relationships are critical to planar light
   circuit (PLC) applications such as 90 degrees optical hybrids for
   coherent optical receiver front-ends, external optical I-Q modulators
   for coherent optical transmitters; and optical phased array switches.
   These applications are illustrated by results obtained from devices that
   have been fabricated and tested by the PTLab in Si micro-photonic
   integration platforms.}},

Abstract = {{The topic of this paper focuses on the development of formation
   controller for multiple car-like mobile robots. The studied robot
   formation is constructed under Leader-Follower approach, so that the
   follower robots are able to keep constant desired distances and relative
   bearing angles with respect to the leader. Affected by the data
   transmission delay between the leader and follower robots, the formation
   performance is degraded, which may even lead to undesired collision of
   the followers. A PD-type controller is proposed to compensate the delay
   effect, which is proved to be stable and effective in formation keeping.
   Some initial studies on parameter selection were also carried out. Both
   simulations and hardware experiments support the implementation of this
   type of controller, which also showed the capability of dealing with
   variable time delays in the communication channel.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-reactors offer distinct advantages over batch reactors currently
   used within the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries. Their high
   surface area-to-volume ratios allow for increased heat and mass
   transfer, which is important for controlling reaction selectivity. In
   addition, micro-reactors are compatible with continuous processing
   technology, circumventing the time delays inherent to batch systems.
   Rapid mixing of reactants within micro-reactors is, however, limited by
   the inherent difficulty of generating turbulence at reduced geometry
   scales. Several different passive mixing strategies have been proposed
   in order to produce eddy-based secondary flows and chaotic mixing. This
   study examines the effectiveness of these strategies by comparing the
   energy-density normalized heat and mass transfer coefficients for a
   selection of industrial micro-reactors. First single, then two-phase
   liquid-liquid experiments were conducted. Pressure drop measurements
   were obtained to calculate friction factors and to verify the presence
   of eddy-based secondary flows. A hot heat exchange fluid and temperature
   measurements were used to estimate the internal convective heat transfer
   coefficients within each structure. Volumetric mass transfer
   coefficients were also determined for the mutual extraction of partially
   miscible n-butanol and water. Semi-empirical correlations for the
   reactors' friction factor and Nusselt number as well as a description of
   the overall mass transfer coefficient based on energy dissipation are

Abstract = {{Experimental studies of blood microflows in rectangular biocompatible
   polymer microchannels measured using micro-particle image velocimetry
   are reported. The data processing methods, data collection methods, and
   choice of channel material are demonstrated to impact the velocity
   profile measurements obtained. Results show that the use of red blood
   cells as tracer particles creates a large depth of correlation which can
   approach the size of the vessel itself and decrease the accuracy of the
   method. It is shown that changing the amount of overlap in the
   post-processing parameters affects the results by nearly 10\%. The
   velocity profile is studied as a function of the flow rate of the blood,
   the hematocrit, or percentage of red blood cells, the shape of the
   channel, and the channel material. The results highlighted here show
   that the best processing options include pre-processing, the use of
   fluorescent tracer particles instead of the red blood cells themselves
   as tracers give a more accurate prediction of the profile, and the use
   of silicone as the channel material more closely mimics the behavior of
   physiology. Acrylic biocompatible polymer channels are shown to give a
   more parabolic profile at lower levels of hematocrit, while silicone
   biocompatible polymer channels give a velocity profile that looks more
   like in vivo flow studies.}},

Abstract = {{Distributional measures of semantic relatedness determine word
   similarity based on how frequently a pair of words appear in the same
   contexts. A typical method is to construct a word-context matrix, then
   re-weight it using some measure of association, and finally take the
   vector distance as a measure of similarity. This has largely been an
   unsupervised process, but in recent years more work has been done
   devising methods of using known sets of synonyms to enhance relatedness
   measures. This paper examines and expands on one such measure, which
   learns a weighting of a word-context matrix by measuring associations
   between words appearing in a given context and sets of known synonyms.
   In doing so we propose a general method of learning weights for
   word-context matrices, and evaluate it on a word similarity task. This
   method works with a variety of measures of association and can be
   trained with synonyms from any resource.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers in the field of Pattern Recognition (PR) have traditionally
   presumed the availability of a representative set of data drawn from the
   classes of interest, say omega(1) and omega(2) in a 2-class problem.
   These samples are typically utilized in the development of the system's
   discriminant function. It is, however, widely recognized that there
   exists a particularly challenging class of PR problems for which a
   representative set is not available for the second class, which has
   motivated a great deal of research into the so-called domain of One
   Class (OC) classification. In this paper, we extend the frontiers of
   novelty detection by the introduction of a new field of problems open
   for analysis. In particular, we note that this new realm deviates from
   the standard set of OC problems based on the presence of three
   characteristics, which ultimately amplify the classification challenge.
   They involve the temporal nature of the appearance of the data, the fact
   that the data from the classes are ``interwoven{''}, and that a
   labelling procedure is not merely impractical - it is almost, by
   definition, impossible. As a first attempt to tackle these problems, we
   present two specialized classification strategies denoted by Scenarios
   S1 and S2 respectively. In Scenarios S1, the data is such that standard
   binary and one-class classifiers can be applied. Alternatively, in
   Scenarios S2, the labelling challenge prevents the application of binary
   classifiers, and instead dictates the novel application of one-class
   classifiers. The validity of these scenarios has been demonstrated for
   the exemplary domain involving the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban-Treaty
   (CTBT), for which our research endeavour has also developed a simulation
   model. As far as we know, our research in this field is of a pioneering
   sort, and the results presented here are novel.}},

Abstract = {{The paper deals with the analysis of tsunami risks for Western Canada
   and the numerical modelling of a potential tsunami which could affect
   the region and generate significant damage to the western Canadian
   coastline. Following a review of the seismic risk and historical
   tsunamis which occurred along the western Canadian coastline, the
   authors concluded that this region is highly vulnerable should a major
   tsunami occur. Consequently, the authors conducted a study on the
   numerical modelling of a possible tsunami generated by movement along
   the Cascadia fault, which is located offshore British Columbia. The
   results of the model outline the significance and extent of the coastal
   flooding risk associated with such a rare, but destructive phenomenon.
   The potential for inundation of the low-lying areas around the coastline
   of Vancouver Island and in and around the City of Vancouver was found to
   be high. A number of recommendations and conclusions focusing on the
   results of the numerical simulation are included.}},

Abstract = {{In order to enhance anaerobic digestion (AD) of the organic fraction of
   municipal solid waste (OFMSW), pretreatment combining two modalities,
   microwave (MW) heating in presence or absence of hydrogen peroxide
   (H(2)O(2)) were investigated. The main pretreatment variables affecting
   the characteristics of the OFMSW were temperature (T) via MW irradiation
   and supplemental water additions of 20\% and 30\% (SWA20 and SW30).
   Subsequently, the focus of this study was to evaluate mesophilic batch
   AD performance in terms of biogas production, as well as changes in the
   characteristics of the OFMSW post digestion. A high MW induced
   temperature range (115-175 degrees C) was applied, using sealed vessels
   and a bench scale MW unit equipped with temperature and pressure
   controls. Biochemical methane potential (BMP) tests were conducted on
   the whole OFMSW as well as the liquid fractions. The whole OFMSW
   pretreated at 115 degrees C and 145 degrees C showed 4-7\% improvement
   in biogas production over untreated OFMSW (control). When pretreated at
   175 degrees C, biogas production decreased due to formation of
   refractory compounds, inhibiting the digestion. For the liquid fraction
   of OFMSW, the effect of pretreatment on the cumulative biogas production
   (CBP) was more pronounced for SWA20 at 145 degrees C, with a 26\%
   increase in biogas production after 8 days of digestion, compared to the
   control. When considering the increased substrate availability in the
   liquid fraction after MW pretreatment, a 78\% improvement in biogas
   production vs. the control was achieved. Combining MW and H(2)O(2)
   modalities did not have a positive impact on OFMSW stabilization and
   enhanced biogas production. In general, all samples pretreated with
   H(2)O(2) displayed a long lag phase and the CBP was usually lower than
   MW irradiated only samples. First order rate constant was calculated.

Abstract = {{Comparison of image processing techniques is critically important in
   deciding which algorithm, method, or metric to use for enhanced image
   assessment. Image fusion is a popular choice for various image
   enhancement applications such as overlay of two image products,
   refinement of image resolutions for alignment, and image combination for
   feature extraction and target recognition. Since image fusion is used in
   many geospatial and night vision applications, it is important to
   understand these techniques and provide a comparative study of the
   methods. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study on 12 selected
   image fusion metrics over six multiresolution image fusion algorithms
   for two different fusion schemes and input images with distortion. The
   analysis can be applied to different image combination algorithms, image
   processing methods, and over a different choice of metrics that are of
   use to an image processing expert. The paper relates the results to an
   image quality measurement based on power spectrum and correlation
   analysis and serves as a summary of many contemporary techniques for
   objective assessment of image fusion algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{The vibration data, especially those collected during the system run-up
   and run-down periods, contain rich information for gearbox condition
   monitoring. Time-frequency (TF) signal analysis is an effective tool to
   detect gearbox faults under varying shaft speed. However, the feature of
   the amplitude modulated-frequency modulated (AM-FM) gearbox fault signal
   usually cannot be directly extracted from the blurred time-frequency
   representation (TFR) caused by the time-varying frequency and noisy
   multicomponent measurement. As such, we propose to use a generalized
   synchrosqueezing transform (GST)-based TF method to detect and diagnose
   gearbox faults. With this method, the original vibration signal is first
   mapped into another analytical signal to facilitate synchrosqueezing of
   the TF picture. A time-scale domain restoration process is then applied
   to recover the instantaneous frequency profile with concentrated TFR The
   gearbox fault, if any, can then be detected by observing the presence of
   the meshing frequency and sideband components in the TFR. The faulty
   gear can be identified via frequency relation analysis of AM-FM
   components. The proposed method is evaluated using both simulated and
   experimental gearbox vibration signals. The results show that the
   proposed approach is effective for gearbox condition monitoring. (C)

Abstract = {{Biodiesel produced from lipid sources is a clean-burning, biodegradable,
   nontoxic fuel that is free of aromatic hydrocarbons. Current biodiesel
   production processes are tedious and involve two to three reaction steps
   each followed by separation and purification. Process integration of
   reaction and separation in a single step within a membrane reactor (MR)
   offers several advantages over conventional reactors.
   This investigation is aimed at studying the effect of membrane flux and
   residence time on the performance of a membrane reactor in treating a
   variety of raw and used feedstocks. A membrane reactor having three
   selectable reactor volumes was designed to decouple the effect of
   residence time in the reactor from membrane flux on the performance of
   the reactor. Low free fatty acid (FFA) oils (FFA < 1\%), i.e. canola,
   corn, sunflower and un-refined soy oils, and high FFA waste cooking oil
   (FFA = 5\%) were base transesterified and the quality of the biodiesel
   produced was determined in terms of free glycerine, mono-glyceride,
   di-glyceride and tri-glyceride content. All oils were base
   transesterified without pretreatment.
   Based on the composition of the final product, the MR could be operated
   at the upper limit of the flux tested (70 L/m(2)/h) and a residence time
   of 60 min. The ASTM D6751 and EN 14214 standards for glycerin and
   glycerides were reached in the washed biodiesel product for all
   feedstocks and run conditions. The operating pressure in the reactor was
   exceeded at 70 L/m(2)/h in treating waste oils and pre-treated corn oil.
   For these oils, reasonable operating pressures in the reactor were
   reached at a membrane flux of 30-40 L/m(2)/h. The quality of the washed
   biodiesel always met ASTM and EN standards. The FAME produced from WCO
   at intermediate fluxes and high residence times met the ASTM and EN
   standards without water washing. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights
