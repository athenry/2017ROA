Abstract = {{Cross-linking of hole-transporting polymer thin films in organic light
   emitting diodes (OLEDs) has been shown to increase device efficacy when
   subsequent layers are deposited from solution. This improvement, due to
   resistance of the films to dissolution, could also be achieved by
   covalently grafting the polymer film to the substrate. Using
   nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), we synthesized a novel
   poly(9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole) (poly(VBK)) copolymer which can be
   cross-linked and also developed two simple methods for the grafting-to
   or grafting-from, also known as surface-initiated polymerization, of
   poly(VBK) to indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates. All three of these
   methods produced thin films that could be orthogonally processed; that
   is, they resisted dissolution when the spin-coating of a subsequent
   layer was simulated. Similar electrochemical behavior for the poly(VBK)
   films was observed regardless of the technique used, suggesting that all
   three techniques could be used in the engineering of organic electronic
   devices. We expect that all three methods would be worth investigating
   in the solution-based assembly of OLEDs and other organic electronic
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{A wavelength-tunable single-frequency fiber laser based on the spectral
   narrowing effect in a nonlinear semiconductor optical amplifier (NL-SOA)

   NL-SOA in the fiber laser cavity, single-frequency lasing is achieved.
   The lasing frequency can be tuned by tuning the center wavelength of a
   tunable filter (TF) incorporated in the laser cavity. The proposed
   wavelength-tunable single-frequency fiber laser is experimentally
   evaluated. Stable single-frequency oscillation with a side-mode
   suppression ratio (SMSR) as high as 55 dB and a spectral linewidth of
   less than 10.1 kHz over a wavelength tuning range of as wide as 48 nm is
   demonstrated. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{In this study Pt nanoparticles supported on NiO, MnO2, and on carbon
   black were prepared and tested for the ammonia electrooxidation reaction
   (AmER) in alkaline media. The morphology and structure of the catalysts
   were characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen
   physisorption, and their surface properties were studied using
   synchrotron radiation photoelectron spectroscopy (SRPES). Cyclic
   voltammetry, chronoamperometry and Tafel plots were used to study the
   electrochemical behavior of ammonia on Pt/metal oxide catalysts. Pt/NiO
   showed the highest current density and the lowest onset potential for
   AmER (-0.48 V vs. Hg/HgO) which increased in the order E-onset(Pt/NiO) <
   E-onset(Pt/MnO2) < E-onset(Pt/C). The reaction kinetic order with
   respect to the concentration of ammonia is close to zero, indicating
   fast surface adsorption of ammonia in agreement with previous studies on
   polycrystalline Pt electrodes, whereas the apparent Tafel slopes were
   found higher (56 69 mV dec(-1)) than previously reported values for Pt
   (39 mV dec(-1)). Our results show that the nature of the support
   strongly influences the size and electronic properties of the Pt
   nanoparticles, and as a result their electrocatalytic activity for AmER.

Abstract = {{A microwave photonic signal processor for arbitrary microwave waveform
   generation and pulse compression based on a microwave photonic filter

   that is the complex conjugate of the spectral response of the MPF. When
   the generated microwave waveform is transmitted and received, by passing
   the received microwave waveform through the same MPF, matched filtering
   is performed and the microwave waveform is compressed. The proposed

   which a linearly chirped microwave waveform (LCMW) with a bandwidth of
   7.7 GHz and a 7-bit phase-coded microwave waveform (PCMW) with a carrier

Abstract = {{Potential effects of SO2 as an impurity on CO2 injectivity for CO2
   storage in a targeted sandstone saline aquifer in western Canada were
   investigated. Batch experiments using rock and brine samples in contact
   with supercritical CO2 and CO2 mixtures with SO2 were conducted in
   high-pressure reactors for 45 days. The results suggest that SO2
   increased precipitation of sodium chloride and calcium sulfate
   dehydrate, and also increased the dissolution of quartz. Moreover, the
   precipitation of sodium chloride appeared to be concurrent with the
   dissolution of quartz, the predominant constituent of the rock. The
   concurrent precipitation of sodium chloride and dissolution of quartz
   could be attributed to taking up of water by H4SiO4 that reduces the
   number of water molecules in the hydration shells of Na+ and Cl- ions in
   highly concentrated brine. According to this view, the dissolution of
   quartz, which would be much slower than the reassociation of dissolved
   sodium chloride ions, is limiting the rate of sodium chloride
   precipitation. The rate of quartz dissolution was estimated based on the
   present experimental data, which could be used to assess salt
   precipitation and determine suitable operation conditions for CO2
   injection. The findings of this work should also be applicable to acid
   gas injection in oil and gas industry. Crown Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The interplay between localized surface plasmon (LSP) resonances and
   their collective responses, known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs),
   in metal nanoparticle arrays can lead to resonances with high Q-factors
   (similar to 100). These responses have in the past usually been studied
   for LSP resonances in the plane of the array of the nanoparticles
   (assumed to be nonmagnetic), thus restricting efficient coupling to
   particles separated along a specific direction. In the present study, we
   demonstrate that LSPs oscillating perpendicular to the plane of the
   surface can lead to stronger inter-particle coupling, which enhances the
   SLRs. This stronger coupling occurs because the out-of-plane
   oscillations can couple in all directions within the plane of the array.
   We study the resulting SLRs for square and hexagonal lattices using the
   discrete-dipole approximation, and we predict much larger Q-factors in
   the wavelength range near 650 nm. This prediction suggests that SLRs
   could be very useful in enhancing various optical processes, and in many
   applications such as sensing and nonlinear optical wave mixing. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{One of the most interesting and promising challenges for Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITSs) relates to the traffic congestion problem.
   Congestion is a relevant issue for transportation because it reduces the
   efficiency of infrastructure and increases travel time, air pollution,
   and fuel consumption. Nowadays, the most promising technology in support
   of ITSs is found in the domain of Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). In
   this paper, we propose three protocols that are able to transmit traffic
   information for routes of interest on VANETs without any Road Side Unit
   (RSU) support. The proposed protocols adopt strategies to improve the
   performance of packet routing based on the density and location of
   vehicles; moreover, they enable an interesting comparison of the
   performance achievable with either reactive or proactive approaches. The
   extensive performance results reported show how it is possible to limit

Abstract = {{In cities, where the number of vehicles continuously increase faster
   than the available infrastructure to contain them, traffic congestion is
   a difficult issue to deal with. This problem becomes even worse in case
   of accidents and affects many aspects of the modern society, including
   economic development, accidents, CO (Carbon monoxide) emission, trip
   time, and health. Several solutions for Traffic Management System (TMS)
   have been proposed to identify congestions and re-route the vehicles
   afterward. To this end, they exchange messages periodically between
   vehicles and central server, what can cause an overhead in the
   communication channel. In this scenario, it is important to identify the
   source of the problem and inform the drivers of new routes before the
   congestion takes place with, considering the limitations of vehicular
   communication. This work introduces ICARUS, a distributed and pro-active
   Traffic Management System, which receives notifications about a traffic
   events then it can calculates new routes, and, then, notifies drivers to
   follow new paths pro-actively by using inter-vehicle communications.
   Simulation results show the effectiveness of ICARUS in calculating new
   routes and disseminating them to vehicles approaching a congested area.
   Hence, ICARUS reduces the travel time, fuel consumption, and CO
   emissions of vehicles in urban environments when compared to existing
   approaches. In addition, ICARUS reduces the broadcast storm problem and
   maximizes the data dissemination capabilities with short delays and low
   overhead. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, real-time energy trading in smart grid is modeled as an
   optimization process under uncertainties of demand and price information
   a problem perspective that is divergent from the ones in the existing
   literature. Energy trading in smart grid is affected by demand
   uncertainties intermittent behavior of renewable energy sources, packet
   loss in the communication network, and fluctuation in customers'
   demands. Energy trading is also affected by price uncertainty due to the
   demand uncertainties. In such uncertainty-prone scenario, we propose the
   algorithm named ENTRUST using the principles of robust game theory to
   maximize the payoff values for both sides customers, and grid. We show
   the existence of robust-optimization equilibrium for establishing the
   convergence of the game. Simulation results show that the proposed
   scheme performs better than the existing ones considered as benchmarks
   in this study. Utilities for the customers are also maximized in order
   to promote cost-effective and reliable energy management in the smart

Title = {{RECODAN: An efficient redundancy coding-based data transmission scheme
   for wireless sensor networks}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{110}},
Pages = {{351-363}},
Month = {{DEC 9}},
Abstract = {{Data transmission reliability is under serious consideration for use in
   wireless sensor networks (WSNs), and retransmission is the most common
   method for ensuring data reliability. However, in recent years, some
   researchers have discovered that redundancy coding is superior to
   retransmission in many respects. In this article, we propose an
   efficient REdundancy COding-based Data trAnsmission scheme for WSNs
   (RECODAN), which guarantees reliable data transmission through hybrid
   retransmission in hop-by-hop. RECODAN uses a selective Reed-Solomon
   coding to reduce the process of encoding in an intermediate node, and
   uses an adaptive codeword retransmission to improve data reliability.
   Furthermore, in this article, we use the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process
   to predict the packet reception rate, which can decrease unnecessary
   redundancy in code delivery and increase network lifetime. Our
   simulation experiments and results show that RECODAN can significantly
   improve data transmission reliability, and can improve task time delay
   and energy consumption, particularly in situations of low packet
   reception rate. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modification of graphene oxide has been performed using diamine
   moieties with varying chain length and subsequently chemically grafted
   with long chain polyurethane for wrapping up of graphene sheet with
   large polymer chains. Functionalization of graphene and its subsequent
   grafting have been verified through spectroscopic measurements like NMR,
   FTIR and UV-visible spectroscopy and the uniform dispersion of graphene
   sheet in polyurethane matrix is achieved. Nanohybrids exhibit better
   thermal and mechanical responses along with greater self-assembly as
   compared to pure polymer. Nanometer dimension molecular sheet to gradual
   increased size of the order of tens of nanometer, hundreds of nanometer
   to micron scale assembly has been captured through XRD, small angle
   neutron scattering, AFM and optical microscopy, respectively. Nature of
   self-assembly associated with stronger interactions sustain the release
   of embedded drug (anticancerous dexamethasone) from nanohybrid and
   larger size of in homogeinities for longer spacer length further sustain
   the drug release and thereby able to control the release rate of drug by
   articulating the chemistry of graphene modifications with suitable
   spacer length of diamine. Biocompatibility of the nanohybrids is
   verified with cell line studies using human breast cancer cells
   MDA-MB-231 in terms of cell viability, cell adhesion, fluorescence
   image, reactive oxygen species and mitochondrial tracker measurements
   indicating better responses of nanohybrid vis-a-vis pure polyurethane.
   Thus, the control release of the dexamethasone drug from the nanohybrids
   along with better biological responses clearly suggests a novel
   biomaterial for the drug carrier. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   sensitive adhesive (PSA) formulations was evaluated. First, a series of

   followed by CLA/Sty/BA bulk terpolymerizations. Pseudo-kinetic models
   were developed and validated with the copolymerization data and extended
   and validated for the CLA/Sty/BA terpolymerization case. The
   pseudo-kinetic models incorporated the electron trapping effect of oleic
   acid, a common impurity found in CLA. A series of emulsion
   terpolymerizations of CLA/Sty/BA were then designed to investigate the
   influence of terpolymer composition, molecular weight, chain transfer
   agent concentration, cross-linker concentration, latex viscosity and
   particle size on PSA performance (tack, peel strength and shear
   strength). Empirical PSA performance models were developed and expressed
   as 3D response surfaces for optimization of the PSA formulation. All
   experiments were performed at 80 degrees C and monitored with attenuated
   total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy
   both off-line (bulk experiments) and inline (emulsion experiments).

Abstract = {{Amphiphilic block copolymers of 2,3,4,5,6-pentafluorostyrene (PFS) and
   methacrylic acid (MAA) are synthesized via nitroxide-mediated
   polymerization (NMP). It is established that to obtain a controlled
   copolymerization a minimum of 40 mol\% of PFS is required, which is
   significantly greater than other copolymerization systems such as using
   4.5-8 mol\% styrene or 1 mol\% of 9-(4-vinylbenzyl)-9H-carbazole to
   control the copolymerization of methacrylates. It is surmised that this
   lack of control is due to the reactivity ratios that favor the addition
   of MAA rather than PFS (r(PFS) = 0.14, r(MAA) = 6.97). However this
   reactivity ratio pair suggests that a one-shot delayed injection
   approach can be utilized to synthesize almost pure block copolymers in
   one pot. Therefore, poly(PFS)-b-(PFS-ran-MAA) block copolymers are
   synthesized by a one-shot delayed addition of MAA. While the
   concentration of irreversibly terminated chains is evident these results
   suggest a promising route to the synthesis of fluorinated amphiphilic
   block copolymers by NMP.}},

Abstract = {{Gaming on demand is an emerging service that has recently started to
   garner prominence in the gaming industry. Cloud-based video games
   provide affordable, flexible, and high-performance solutions for
   end-users with constrained computing resources and enables them to play
   high-end graphic games on low-end thin clients. Despite its advantages,
   cloud gaming's Quality of Experience (QoE) suffers from high and varying
   end-to-end delay. Since the significant part of computational
   processing, including game rendering and video compression, is performed
   in data centers, controlling the transfer of information within the
   cloud has an important impact on the quality of cloud gaming services.
   In this article, a novel method for minimizing the end-to-end latency
   within a cloud gaming data center is proposed. We formulate an
   optimization problem for reducing delay, and propose a Lagrangian
   Relaxation (LR) time-efficient heuristic algorithm as a practical
   solution. Simulation results indicate that the heuristic method can
   provide close-to-optimal solutions. Also, the proposed model reduces
   end-to-end delay and delay variation by almost 11\% and 13.5\%,
   respectively, and outperforms the existing server-centric and
   network-centric models. As a byproduct, our proposed method also
   achieves better fairness among multiple competing players by almost
   45\%, on average, in comparison with existing methods.}},

Abstract = {{A vertex colouring of a graph is nonrepetitive if there is no path whose
   first half receives the same sequence of colours as the second half. A
   graph is nonrepetitively l-choosable if given lists of at least l

   each vertex is coloured from its own list. It is known that, for some
   constant c, every graph with maximum degree Delta is c
   Delta(2)-choosable. We prove this result with c=1 (ignoring lower order
   terms). We then prove that every subdivision of a graph with
   sufficiently many division vertices per edge is nonrepetitively
   5-choosable. The proofs of both these results are based on the
   Moser-Tardos entropy-compression method, and a recent extension by
   Grytczuk, Kozik and Micek for the nonrepetitive choosability of paths.
   Finally, we prove that graphs with pathwidth theta are nonrepetitively

Abstract = {{On 11 March 2011, an exceptionally large tsunami event was triggered by
   a massive earthquake offshore, the northeast coast of Japan, which
   affected coastal infrastructure such as seawalls, coastal dikes and
   breakwaters in the Tohoku region. Such infrastructure was built to
   protect against the Level 1 tsunamis that previously hit the region, but
   not for events as significant as the 2011 Tohoku tsunami, which was
   categorized as a Level 2 tsunami {[}Shibayama, T., Esteban, M., Nistor,
   I., Takagi, H., Thao, N. D., Matsumaru, R., Mikami, T., Aranguiz, R.,
   Jayaratne, R. \& Ohira, K. {[}2013] ``Classification of tsunami and
   evacuation areas,{''} Nat. Hazards 67(2), 365-386]. The failure
   mechanisms of concrete-armored dikes, breakwaters and seawalls due to
   Level 2 tsunamis are still not fully understood by researchers and
   engineers. This paper investigates the failure modes and mechanisms of
   damaged coastal structures in Miyagi and Fukushima Prefectures,
   following the authors' post-disaster field surveys carried out between
   2011 and 2013. Six significant failure mechanisms were identified for
   the coastal dikes and seawalls affected by this tsunami: (1) Leeward toe
   scour failure, (2) Crown armor failure, (3) Leeward slope armor failure,
   (4) Seaward toe scour and slope armor failure, (5) Overturning failure,
   and (6) Parapet wall failure, in which leeward toe scour being
   recognized as the major failure mechanism in most surveyed locations.
   The authors also propose a simple practical mathematical model for
   predicting the scour depth at the leeward toe of the coastal dikes, by
   considering the effects of the tsunami hydrodynamics, the soil
   properties and the type of structure. The key advantage of this model is
   that it depends entirely on quantities that are measurable in the field.
   Furthermore this model was further refined by conducting a series of
   hydraulic model experiments aimed to understand the governing factors of
   the leeward toe scour failure. Finally, based on the results obtained,
   key recommendations are given for the design of resilient coastal
   defense structures that can survive a level 2 tsunami event.}},

   closed-form solution for an optimal transmit covariance matrix is
   obtained when the channel is strictly degraded. In combination with the
   rank-1 solution, this provides the complete characterization of the
   optimal covariance for the case of two transmit antennas. The cases of
   weak eavesdropper and high SNR are considered. It is shown that the
   optimal covariance does not converge to a scaled identity in the
   high-SNR regime. Necessary optimality conditions and a tight upper bound
   on the rank of an optimal covariance matrix are established for the
   general case, along with a lower bound to the secrecy capacity, which is

Abstract = {{The chemical reactivity of cemented paste backfill (CPB) plays a
   significant role in its durability and environmental behavior.
   Therefore, the reactivity of sulphide bearing tailings incorporated into
   CPB systems should be assessed to avoid or prevent adverse potential
   environmental effects. The objective of this study is to therefore
   experimentally assess the influence of time and mechanical damage on the
   reactivity of CPB samples prepared with tailings that contain different
   pyrite contents (up to 45 wt.\%). Oxygen consumption (OC) tests are
   conducted on undamaged and mechanically damaged CPB specimens cured at
   different times to study their reactivity. Furthermore, the
   microstructural changes of the tested CPB samples are investigated by
   conducting microstructural analyses (e.g., scanning electron microscopy
   with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, mercury intrusion
   porosimetry, and thermogravimetry/derivative thermogravimetry). The
   obtained results show that the reactivity of CPB is time-dependent. The
   reactivity decreases as the curing time and ageing of the CPB increase.
   It was also found that the microstructure or pore structure of CPB
   significantly affects its reactivity. The encapsulation or coating of
   the tailings particles with cement hydration products also contributed
   to the reduction of the reactivity of CPB. It is also found that the
   reactivity of CPB increases as the level of damage is increased. A
   relationship between the increase in reactivity and level of mechanical
   damage can be established. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to assimilate in situ surface
   soil moisture and streamflow observation at the outlet of an
   experimental watershed outlet into a semi-distributed SWAT (Soil and
   Water Assessment Tool) model. Watershed scale, instead of HRU scale soil
   moisture was used in state vector to reduce computational burden.
   Numerical experiments were designed to select the best state vector
   which consists of streamflow and soil moisture in all vertical soil
   layers. Compared to open-loop model and direct-insert method, the
   estimate of both soil moisture and streamflow has been improved by EKF
   assimilation. The combined assimilation of surface soil moisture and
   streamflow outperforms the assimilation with only surface soil moisture
   or streamflow especially in the estimate of full profile soil moisture.
   The NSC has been improved to 0.63 from -4.45 and the RMSE has been
   reduced to 12.34 mm from 47.44 mm in open-loop. Such improvement is also
   reflected in the short term forecast of soil moisture. The improvement
   of streamflow prediction is relatively moderate in both simulation and
   forecast mode compared to quality of the soil moisture prediction. The
   quantification of the model error, especially the error covariance
   between different state variables, was found to be critical to the
   estimate of the state variable corresponding to the error covariance.

   be attributed to the synergetic effects among Ag nanoparticles, rGO, and

Title = {{Efficient Cholesky Factor Recovery for Column Reordering in Simultaneous

Abstract = {{Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping problems are inherently dynamic
   and the structure of the graph representing them changes significantly
   over time. To obtain the least square solution of such systems
   efficiently, it is desired to maintain a good column ordering such that
   fill-ins are reduced. This comes at a cost since general ordering
   changes require the complete re-computation of the Cholesky factor.
   While some methods have obtained good results with reordering at loop
   closing, the changes are not guaranteed to be limited to the scope of
   the loop, leading to suboptimal performance. In this article, it is
   shown that the Cholesky factorisation of an updated matrix can be
   efficiently recovered from the previous factorisation if the
   permutations are localised. This is experimentally demonstrated on 2D
   SLAM datasets. A method is then provided to identify when such recovery
   is advantageous over the complete re-computation of the Cholesky factor.
   Furthermore, a hybrid algorithm combining factorisation recovery and
   re-computation of the Cholesky factor is proposed for dynamically
   evolving problems and tested on SLAM datasets. Steps where reordering
   occurs can be executed up to 67 \% faster with the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{With advances in lasers, optics, and electronics, many new 3D display
   technologies have been proposed with prototypes in research labs or have
   entered the marketplace. Although some of these technologies (such as
   Stereoscopy) are familiar to people, other technologies, such as
   holography, remain far-fetched to most. This survey introduces the
   principles of current popular 3D display technologies, which are
   generally categorized into four categories: 3D movies, on-stage
   holograms, holographic projections and volumetric 3D displays.
   Furthermore, the limitations of each of the aforementioned technologies
   are deeply analyzed, and comparisons of these technologies are provided.
   Moreover, we note appropriate application situations for the various
   technologies. Because computer-generated hologram (CGH) technologies are
   considered to be the next generation of 3D display technology and have
   become a dominant direction in 3D display technology development, we
   address the challenges that CGH is currently facing and provide an
   insightful analysis of solutions proposed in recent years. Finally, we
   study the current 3D display applications associated with the four
   categorized technology principles.}},

Title = {{Modeling Behavior of Friction Pile in Compacted Glacial Till}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Experimental and numerical modeling studies related to the behavior of
   pile foundations are conventionally undertaken based on the assumption
   that the surrounding soils are in a state of saturated condition. Such
   an assumption may contribute to erroneous estimations of the stability
   and settlement behavior of pile foundations installed in unsaturated
   soils due to neglecting the influence of soil suction. In this paper,
   the behavior of a single friction pile loaded in drained and undrained
   conditions in a compacted glacial till is modeled using finite-element
   analyses (FEAs). The influence of the soil suction on (1) the shear
   strength and the modulus of elasticity of the soil and (2) the shear
   strength of the pile-soil interface derived from the experimental
   studies is discussed and considered in the FEA. There is reasonable
   agreement between the load-settlement behavior and the bearing capacity
   of the friction pile modeled using the FEA and the measured results from
   experimental studies. This study highlights the significant influence of
   the soil suction on the behavior of single friction pile and suggests a
   relatively simple approach to reasonably model the pile behavior using
   the FEA. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Simply supported wooden beams nailed to deck boards subjected to wind
   uplift forces are subjected to compressive stresses at their bottom
   fibers. Because the restraining action provided by decking is at the top
   fibers, it is unclear to what extent such restraints are effective in
   controlling lateral torsional buckling as a possible mode of failure
   under wind uplift. Present design standards do not have provisions for
   such cases. Thus, the present study aims to quantify the effect of
   restraints provided by the deck boards on the lateral torsional buckling
   capacity of twin-beam-deck systems under wind uplift. Toward this goal,
   a series of analytical and numerical models were formulated. All models
   capture the continuous rigid lateral restraint and partial twisting
   restraint provided by the deck boards. The effects of load type and load
   position were investigated. The bending stiffness of deck boards was
   observed to have a significant influence on the lateral torsional
   buckling capacity of twin-beam-deck systems.}},

Abstract = {{An understanding of the behavior of wood stud walls in a region
   corresponding to hazardous-blowout damage levels is currently lacking.
   The focus of the current study is on investigating the flexural response
   of full-scale wood stud walls subjected to pressure-impulse combinations
   that would yield severe damage levels. Static material properties were
   determined and used as input in an analytical model that considers the
   nonlinear behavior of stud-to-sheathing joints, as well as high
   strain-rate effects. Experimental results showed that premature
   sheathing failure could occur prior to full flexural stud response, and
   that sheathing panel debris could be generated. The use of thicker
   sheathing and screws shifted the failures to the studs, while decreasing
   the amount of debris. Welded wire mesh was successfully used as a
   reinforcement of the sheathing or as a catcher system while maintaining
   the residual axial capacity of the studs. A single-degree-of-freedom
   material-predictive model was successfully validated using the
   experimental test results.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{Flood disasters such as dam breaks and surges from extreme hurricanes or
   tsunamis entrain and transport substantial amounts of submerged or
   floating debris. Understanding of motion and spatiotemporal distribution
   of debris entrained by a flood is thus of great importance to hydraulic,
   coastal, and structural engineers; the displacement of debris to a
   location where it may eventually impact critical infrastructure requires
   scientific attention at the laboratory scale first. In this context, the
   design and application of a novel smart debris system utilizing
   off-the-shelf components is presented and discussed. The system tracks
   the spatial location and orientation of a multitude of debris specimens
   and it proposes an accurate tool to assess their individual trajectory,
   velocity, and momentum in a laboratory environment. Contrary to the
   traditional camera-based approach of video tracking, which often fails
   once objects are submerged, the proposed smart debris system delivers
   six-degree-of-freedom (6DOF) data in a reliable, timely manner.
   Miniaturized inertial measurement units (IMU), commonly called motion
   sensors, which are used for attitude heading reference systems are
   deployed to output time series of spatial orientation along with
   filtered 3D acceleration readings. A Bluetooth low-energy (BLE) tracking
   system is applied along with the motion sensor to track the 3D debris
   positions. A detailed investigation in controlled laboratory conditions
   reveals the detailed individual performance of the tested spatial
   orientations and positions. As an application, debris transport tests
   were conducted in a newly built tsunami wave basin at Waseda University
   in Tokyo, Japan. For this test series, a typical harbor layout with a
   vertical quay wall adjacent to a horizontal container-stacking platform
   was constructed. The advection by a broken tsunamilike bore of multiple
   down-scaled shipping containers in basic arrangements was then tracked
   from their initial position. The performance of the innovative smart
   debris system is qualitatively tested in order to provide guidance for
   their future application in hydraulic and coastal engineering as well as
   to provide a solid basis for its application in field studies. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) have attracted an increasing
   amount of attention within both public and private sectors due to the
   unprecedented number of vehicles all over the world. ITS aim to provide
   innovative applications and services relating to traffic management, and
   enable ease of access to information for various system users. The
   intent to utilize the excessive on-board resources in the transportation
   system, along with the latest computing resource management technology
   in conventional clouds, has cultivated the concept of the Vehicular
   Cloud. Evolved from Vehicular networks, the vehicular cloud can be
   formed by vehicles autonomously, and provides a large number of
   applications and services that can benefit the entire transportation
   system, as well as drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. However, due to
   high traffic mobility, the vehicular cloud is built on dynamic physical
   resources; as a result, it experiences several inherent challenges,
   which increase the complexity of its implementations. Having a detailed
   picture of the number of vehicles, as well as their time of availability
   in a given region through a model, works as a critical stepping stone
   for enabling vehicular clouds, as well as any other system involving
   vehicles moving over the traffic network. Therefore, in this paper we
   present a comprehensive stochastic analysis of several traffic
   characteristics related to the implementation of vehicular cloud inside
   a road segment by adopting proper traffic models. According to the
   analytical results, we demonstrate the feasibility of running a certain
   class of applications or services on the vehicular cloud, even for
   highly dynamic scenarios. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{COASTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{118}},
Pages = {{35-49}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Experimental research was conducted focusing on debris motion over a
   horizontal apron featuring vertical obstacles in the path of the debris
   propagation. The apron was designed as a typical representation of a
   harbor threatened by an inundating tsunami. The experimental setup
   idealized often complex harbor settings. The debris was a scaled-down
   20-foot shipping container modelled at a 1 in 40 Froude length scale.
   Offand onshore regions were separated by a vertical quay wall which
   allowed the incoming elongated solitary wave used to represent the first
   part of a tsunami to steepen, break and propagate over the initially dry
   surface as a tsunami-like bore. In the path of propagation, a varying
   number of debris were entrained within the inundating bore over the
   horizontal apron. The entrained debris interacted with regularly spaced
   vertical obstacles representing infrastructure and houses within the
   propagation path. Varying debris and obstacle arrangements were tested
   to evaluate the effects the obstacles would have on the debris' maximum
   longitudinal displacement and the spreading angle. The main conclusion
   is that the spreading angle of the debris is not as significantly
   altered by the presence of obstacles on the harbor apron whereas the
   maximum longitudinal displacement of the debris was significantly
   affected. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{71}},
Pages = {{99-104}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, soybean meal flour, polyacrylamide (PAM), sodium dodecyl
   sulfate (SDS), and a commercial epoxy resin (EP) was used to develop
   different adhesive formulations. The solid content and viscosity of the
   adhesives were measured. Three-ply plywood was fabricated to measure the
   water resistance of the different adhesives. The crystallinity and
   infrared spectra of the cured adhesives were investigated. The results
   indicated that PAM and SDS acted as denature and retention agents,
   respectively, to improve the water resistance of the resulting adhesive
   by 38.7\%. EP reacted with active groups on protein molecules to form a
   cross-linking network to decrease the crystallinity of the cured
   adhesive and improve its water resistance. Incorporating 5 wt\% EP
   improved the water resistance of the adhesive by 236.7\% and the wet
   shear strength of the resulting plywood to 1.12 MPa, which met interior
   use requirement. Adding EP also increased the adhesive solid content to
   32.85 wt\% and decreased the adhesive viscosity to 20,415 mPa s, which
   would be beneficial to soybean meal-based adhesive industrial
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable energy and clean environment are two crucial requirements for
   our modern world. Low cost, energy production and limited environmental
   impact make anaerobic digestion (AD) a promising technology for
   stabilizing organic waste and in particular, sewage waste. The anaerobic
   co-digestion of thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and sewage
   treatment plant trapped fat, oil and grease (FOG) using different
   FOG-TWAS mixtures (20, 40, 60 and 80\% of FOG based on total volatile
   solids (TVS)) were investigated in this study using both thermophilic
   (55 +/- 1 degrees C) and two stages hyper-thermophilic/thermophilic (70
   +/- 1 degrees C and 55 +/- 1 degrees C) anaerobic co-digestion. The
   hyper-thermophilic co-digestion approach as a part of the co-digestion
   process has been shown to be very useful in improving the methane
   production. During hyper-thermophilic biochemical methane potential
   (BMP) assay testing the sample with 60\% FOG (based on TVS) has been
   shown to significantly increase the maximum methane production to 673.1
   +/- 14.0 ml of methane as compared to 316.4 +/- 143 ml of methane for
   the control sample. This represents a 112.7\% increase in methane
   production compared to the control sample considered in this paper.
   These results signify the importance of hyper-thermophilic digestion to
   the co-digestion of TWAS-FOG field. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{To improve the photocatalytic activity of graphitic carbon nitride

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{214}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Reliable information on the wetting front depth and variation of water
   contents within the zone of wetting is required for addressing
   geotechnical problems in loess deposits such as estimation of the
   collapse deformation and assessment of the slope stability. For this
   reason, a field test was conducted at a site in the Loess Plateau of
   China to obtain data on soil water contents and temperatures at
   different depths for a period of one year. The variation of water
   contents was interpreted from the influence of environmental factors and
   soil temperature, and used to determine the maximum wetting front depth
   in the loess soils in the study region. In addition, a commercial
   software, VADOSE/W, was used to simulate the flow behaviour in
   unsaturated loess taking account of the influence of environmental
   factors. A reasonable agreement was found between the results of field
   investigations and numerical simulations. The study results are useful
   as they provide valuable information about the wetting front depth and
   water content variation in unsaturated loess in response to
   environmental factors. The field investigations and numerical
   simulations summarized in this paper can serve as a reference for future
   studies on other soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years, we are witnessing a growing interest into the
   design of smart vehicles and smart roads for Intelligent transportation
   systems. Vehicles as part of the Internet of Things should provide to
   the driver and passenger with a variety of services using efficient
   gateway discovery mechanism while maintaining a certain level of
   security and authentication to avoid potential malicious attacks. In
   this paper, we propose a secure hybrid adaptive gateway discovery and
   communication protocol for smart vehicular networks, which we refer to
   as SEGAL. Our proposed SEGAL protocol is based upon building a secure
   clustered vehicular network, and permits the exchange of gateway
   discovery messages through authenticated clusterheads and cluster
   members. We shall present the design of our protocol, and describe how
   it can overcome the possible malicious attacks that might harm the
   network. Then, we report its efficiency and scalability using an
   extensive set of simulation experiments using Ns-2 simulator. Our
   results indicate that the proposed SEGAL protocol is scalable while
   achieving high success rate, low response time and dropping rate.

   high hydrophobic (HPO) natural organic matter (NOM) content. Water
   samples pretreated at full-scale plants were subjected to multiple-day
   UF membrane fouling tests (constant flux with backwash and chemical
   cleaning) using an automated bench-scale UF hollow fiber membrane
   system. Based on the samples tested, coagulation/floatation pretreatment
   resulted in less fouling than coagulation/sedimentation during both
   summer and winter testing. The improved performance appears to be linked
   to greater HPO NOM removal by the pretreatment. Most fouling could be
   reversed by hydraulic backwashing and chemical cleaning. Enhanced
   chemical backwash with 100 mg L-1 chlorine and chemical clean with 0.1 N
   NaOH and 200 mg L-1 chlorine were found to be very effective at reducing
   fouling for pretreated water. As expected, longer filtration cycles
   resulted in greater fouling. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The diversity in eukaryotic life reflects a diversity in
   regulatory pathways. Nocedal and Johnson argue that the rewiring of gene
   regulatory networks is a major force for the diversity of life, that
   changes in regulation can create new species.
   Results: We have created a method (based on our new ``ping-pong
   algorithm) for detecting more complicated rewirings, where several
   transcription factors can substitute for one or more transcription
   factors in the regulation of a family of co-regulated genes. An example
   is illustrative. A rewiring has been reported by Hogues et al. that RAP1
   in Saccharomyces cerevisiae substitutes for TBF1/CBF1 in Candida
   albicans for ribosomal RP genes. There one transcription factor
   substitutes for another on some collection of genes. Such a substitution
   is referred to as a ``rewiring{''}. We agree with this finding of
   rewiring as far as it goes but the situation is more complicated. Many
   transcription factors can regulate a gene and our algorithm finds that
   in this example a ``team{''} (or collection) of three transcription
   factors including RAP1 substitutes for TBF1 for 19 genes. The switch
   occurs for a branch of the phylogenetic tree containing 10 species
   (including Saccharomyces cerevisiae), while the remaining 13 species
   (Candida albicans) are regulated by TBF1.
   Conclusions: To gain insight into more general evolutionary mechanisms,
   we have created a mathematical algorithm that finds such general
   switching events and we prove that it converges. Of course any such
   computational discovery should be validated in the biological tests. For
   each branch of the phylogenetic tree and each gene module, our algorithm
   finds a sub-group of co-regulated genes and a team of transcription
   factors that substitutes for another team of transcription factors. In
   most cases the signal will be small but in some cases we find a strong
   signal of switching. We report our findings for 23 Ascomycota fungi
   species.}},

Abstract = {{A series of graphene oxide-modified, multi-phase Ag2O/Ag3VO4/AgVO3
   composites were synthesized via simple procedures at room temperature.
   Compared to those of pure Ag2O/Ag3VO4/AgVO3, these GO-modified
   composites exhibited enhanced activities during photocatalytic
   degradation of rhodamine B and methyl orange under visible light
   illumination. A study of the effect of graphene oxide (GO) addition on
   photocatalytic performance indicated that 1.2 wt\% GO was the optimum
   quantity. The increased photocatalytic activities of as-prepared
   GO-modified composites may be attributed to the large surface area
   possessed by GO as well as its interactions with other species in the
   multi-phase Ag2O/Ag3VO4/AgVO3 composites during photocatalytic reactions
   under visible light illumination. From the enhancement in photocatalytic
   activity, it may be inferred that GO could improve the adsorption and
   absorption capabilities of the Ag2O/Ag3VO4/AgVO3 composites and promote
   the separation of electron-hole (e-h) pairs during photocatalytic
   reactions compared to those of composites without GO addition. Moreover,
   GO as a modifier was able to partially protect silver species composites
   from photocorrosion. A possible mechanism was proposed for the
   photocatalytic degradation of organic dyes on the surface of GO-modified
   Ag2O/Ag3VO4/AgVO3. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigated the microstructure evolution, tensile, impact,
   hardness, and sliding wear properties of an Al-20Mg(2)Si-2Cu in situ
   composite treated with different Bi contents. The desired modification
   of primary Mg2Si particles was achieved with the addition of 0.4 wt\%
   Bi. Increasing Bi beyond 0.4 wt\% resulted in a loss of modification,
   possibly due to the formation of Al8MgBiSi4 compound before the
   precipitation of the primary Mg2Si. Additionally, the structure of the
   pseudo-eutectic Mg2Si was transformed from plate to fibrous, which was
   consistent with decrease of growth temperature extracted from the
   cooling curve thermal analysis. Addition of Bi had an effect on the
   morphology of Al5FeSi(beta), Al2Cu (theta) and Al5Cu2Mg8Si6 (Q)
   intermetallic compounds. The tensile strength, elongation percentage,
   impact toughness, and hardness increased by 6\%, 13\%, 75\%, and 23\%,
   respectively, due to modification of both the primary and eutectic Mg2Si
   crystals. The tensile and impact fracture surfaces showed fewer
   decohered particles in the Bi-treated composite. The enhancement in wear
   resistance of the Bi-treated composite could be attributed to solid
   lubricant function of insoluble soft Bi phase and modification effects
   on Mg2Si particles. Copyright (C) 2016, The editorial office of Journal

Abstract = {{The structure defect of the GM(1,N) model is the major reason for its
   low simulation and prediction performance. To address this issue, a
   linear correction item h(1)(k - 1) and a grey action quantity h(2) are
   introduced into the GM(1,N) model to improve its structure in this
   paper. Specifically, the `h(1)(k - 1)' reflects the linear relations
   between the dependent variable and the independent variables, and the
   `h(2)' shows the data change law of the dependent variable sequence.
   Based on this, a novel multi-variable grey forecasting model, NGM(1,1),
   is proposed. Furthermore, the NGM(1,N) model's time-response expression
   and the final restored expression are proved, its initial value is
   optimized, and a MATLAB program for building the NGM(1,N) model is
   developed. Lastly the NGM(1,N) model is applied to simulate and forecast
   the amount of Beijing's motor vehicles. The mean relative simulation and
   prediction percentage errors of the new model are only 0.009\% and
   1.149\%, in comparison with the ones obtained from the traditional
   GM(1,N) model and the classical DGM(1,1) model, which are 4.680\%,
   10.685\% and 4.411\%, 11.167\% respectively. The findings show that the
   new model has the best performance, which confirms the effectiveness of
   the structure improvement. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   resonator for integrated microwave photonic applications}},
Journal = {{APL PHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Silicon photonics with advantages of small footprint, compatibility with
   the mature CMOS fabrication technology, and its potential for seamless
   integration with electronics is making a significant difference in
   realizing on-chip integration of photonic systems. A microdisk resonator
   (MDR) with a strong capacity in trapping and storing photons is a
   versatile element in photonic integrated circuits. Thanks to the large
   index contrast, a silicon-based MDR with an ultra-compact footprint has
   a great potential for large-scale and high-density integrations.
   However, the existence of multiple whispering gallery modes (WGMs) and
   resonance splitting in an MDR imposes inherent limitations on its
   widespread applications. In addition, the waveguide structure of an MDR
   is incompatible with that of a lateral PN junction, which leads to the
   deprivation of its electrical tunability. To circumvent these
   limitations, in this paper we propose a novel design of a silicon-based
   MDR by introducing a specifically designed slab waveguide to surround
   the disk and the lateral sides of the bus waveguide to suppress
   higher-order WGMs and to support the incorporation of a lateral PN
   junction for electrical tunability. An MDR based on the proposed design
   is fabricated and its optical performance is evaluated. The fabricated
   MDR exhibits single-mode operation with a free spectral range of 28.85
   nm. Its electrical tunability is also demonstrated and an electro-optic
   frequency response with a 3-dB modulation bandwidth of similar to 30.5
   GHz is measured. The use of the fabricated MDR for the implementation of
   an electrically tunable optical delay-line and a tunable
   fractional-order temporal photonic differentiator is demonstrated. (C)

   mineral composition, and particle size distribution, the carbonate
   Indonesian asphalt rocks (oil-wetted) are proven to be poorly extracted
   by the commercial hot-water based extraction (7.8\% bitumen recovery at
   50 degrees C and pH 9.0). Great enhancement was obtained using
   multi-staged solvent extraction with four typical solvents (i.e.,
   toluene, n-heptane, n-hexane, and cyclohexane), resulting in a
   cumulative bitumen recovery up to 98\% at ambient conditions. After the
   extraction, a systematical particle sedimentation test has been
   conducted in the non-aqueous phase. It is found that there are oil-phase
   and consolidated zone with only one clear solid liquid interface
   appearing in the toluene and cyclohexane solutions with high bitumen
   during the carbonate particle sedimentation. However, an extra
   ``settling zone{''} appeared between the oil-phase and consolidated zone
   in n-heptane and n-hexane solutions, resulting in the appearance of two
   solid liquid interfaces. A mathematical model has been proposed to
   describe the carbonate particle settling behaviors for both interfaces
   in different solvent extraction systems. The settling rates of carbonate
   particles in different solutions are in a descending order of n-hexane >
   n-heptane > toluene > cyclohexane. The equilibrium height of settled
   solids is found to be higher in n-hexane and n-heptane systems than
   those in toluene and cyclohexane systems at given conditions, which is
   mainly contributed to the higher bitumen components (e.g., asphaltenes)
   attached on the solid surfaces. A water-flooding method is finally
   applied to remove and recover the residual solvent from the waste
   solids, leading up to 93\% of the residual solvent together with some
   residual bitumen being recovered. It is also found that increasing the
   wettability of residual carbonate solids by increasing extraction times
   is beneficial for the residual solvent recovery.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of GaAs nanowire (NW) solar cells can be significantly
   improved with no new processing steps or material requirements. We
   report coupled optoelectronic simulations of a GaAs NW solar cell with a
   vertical p-i-n junction and a highbandgap AlInP passivating shell. Our
   frequency-dependent model facilitates calculation of quantum efficiency
   for the first time in NW solar cells. For passivated NWs, we find that
   short-wavelength photons can be most effectively harnessed by using a
   thin emitter, while long-wavelength photons are best utilized by
   extending the intrinsic region to the NW/substrate interface and using
   the substrate as a base. These two easily implemented changes, coupled
   with the increase of NW height to 3.5 mu m with realistic surface
   recombination in the presence of a passivation shell, result in an NW
   solar cell with greater than 19\% efficiency.}},

Pages = {{41-54}},

Abstract = {{A finite element buckling eigenvalue solution is developed for the
   analysis of sandwich pipes subjected to internal and external
   hydrostatic pressure. The principle of stationary potential energy is
   used to formulate the conditions of equilibrium and neutral stability
   using polar coordinates. The formulation accounts for shear deformation
   effects and is suited for sandwich pipe systems with thick cores. It
   involves two destabilizing terms: one is due to the external hydrostatic
   pressure and incorporates the follower effects, and the other, is due to
   the pre-bucking stresses undergoing nonlinear components of strains. The
   formulation adopts a work conjugate triplet consisting the Cauchy stress
   tensor, the Green Lagrange strain tensor, and constant constitutive
   relations. A finite element solution is developed and implemented under
   MATLAB and is then applied to predict the buckling capacity of sandwich
   pipes consisting of two steel pipes with a soft core. A verification
   study is conducted, and the validity of the formulation is established
   through comparison with other solutions. A parametric study is then
   conducted to investigate the effect of hydrostatic internal pressure,
   core material, core thickness, internal and external pipe thicknesses,
   on the budding capacity of sandwich pipes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   stresses and coronary flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{806}},
Pages = {{129-164}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The effects of the orientation of a bileaflet mechanical heart valve on
   the viscous and turbulent stresses in the flow past it and on the flow
   rate in the right coronary artery were investigated in vitro in a mock
   circulation loop, using a fluid that matched the kinematic viscosity of
   blood and the refractive index of the aorta model. Measurements were
   made past the valve mounted in three orientations at the base of an
   anatomical aorta model, within physiological aortic flow conditions. At
   peak flow, the turbulent stresses were on average 21\% higher and
   viscous stresses exceeding 10 Pa (namely of a level that has been
   associated with blood cell damage) were 30\% more frequent when the
   valve was oriented with its plane of symmetry normal to the aorta's
   plane of curvature than when it was parallel to it. This was attributed
   to the impingement of a lateral jet on the concave wall of the aorta and
   to steeper velocity gradients resulting from the geometrical imbalance
   of the sinuses relative to the valve's central jet when the valve was in
   the `normal' orientation. Very high levels of turbulent stresses were
   found to occur distal to the corners of the valve's lateral orifices.
   The bulk flow rate in the right coronary artery was highest when the
   valve was positioned with its central orifice aligned with the artery's
   opening. The coronary flow rate was directly affected by the size,
   orientation and time evolution of the vortex in the sinus, all of which
   were sensitive to the valve's orientation.}},

Title = {{Planar biaxial testing of heart valve cusp replacement biomaterials:
   Experiments, theory and material constants}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{303-320}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: Aortic valve (AV) repair has become an attractive option to
   correct aortic insufficiency. Yet, cusp reconstruction with various cusp
   replacement materials has been associated with greater long-term repair
   failures, and it is still unknown how such materials mechanically
   compare with native leaflets. We used planar biaxial testing to
   characterize six clinically relevant cusp replacement materials, along
   with native porcine AV leaflets, to ascertain which materials would be
   best suited for valve repair.
   Methods: We tested at least six samples of: 1) fresh autologous porcine
   pericardium (APP), 2) glutaraldehyde fixed porcine pericardium (GPP), 3)
   St Jude Medical pericardial patch (SJM), 4) CardioCel patch (CC), 5)
   PeriGuard (PG), 6) Supple PeriGuard (SPG) and 7) fresh porcine AV
   leaflets (PC). We introduced efficient displacement-controlled testing
   protocols and processing, as well as advanced convexity requirements on
   the strain energy functions used to describe the mechanical response of
   the materials under loading.
   Results: The proposed experimental and data processing pipeline allowed
   for a robust in-plane characterization of all the materials tested, with
   constants determined for two Fung-like hyperelastic, anisotropic strain
   energy models.
   Conclusions: Overall, CC and SPG (respectively PG) patches ranked as the
   closest mechanical equivalents to young (respectively aged) AV leaflets.
   Because the native leaflets as well as CC, PG and SPG patches exhibit
   significant anisotropic behaviors, it is suggested that the fiber and
   cross-fiber directions of these replacement biomaterials be matched with
   those of the host AV leaflets.
   Statement of Significance
   The long-term performance of cusp replacement materials would ideally be
   evaluated in large animal models for AV disease and cusp repair, and
   over several months or more. Given the unavailability and impracticality
   of such models, detailed information on stress-strain behavior, as
   studied herein, and investigations of durability and valve dynamics will
   be the best surrogates, as they have been for prosthetic valves.
   Overall, comparison with Fig. 3 suggests that CC and SPG (respectively
   PG) patches may be the closest mechanical equivalents to young
   (respectively aged) AV leaflets. Interestingly, the thicknesses of these
   materials are close to those reported for porcine and younger human AV
   leaflets, which may facilitate surgical implantation, by contrast to the
   thinner APP which has poor handling qualities. Because the native
   leaflets as well as CC, PG and SPG patches exhibit anisotropic
   behaviors, from a mechanistic perspective alone, it stands to reason
   that cardiac surgeons should seek to intraoperatively match the fiber
   and cross-fiber directions of these replacement biomaterials with those
   of the repaired AV leaflets. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Abstract = {{A facile and feasible oil-in-water self-assembly approach was developed
   to synthesize flower-like Ag@AgBr/Bi2O2CO3 micro-composites. The
   photocatalytic activities of the samples were evaluated through
   methylene blue degradation under visible light irradiation. Compared to
   Bi2O2CO3, flower-like Ag@AgBr/Bi2O2CO3 micro-composites show enhanced
   photocatalytic activities. In addition, results indicate that both the
   physicochemical properties and associated photocatalytic activities of
   Ag@AgBr/Bi2O2CO3 composites are shown to be dependent on the loading
   quantity of Ag@AgBr. The highest photocatalytic performance was achieved
   at 7 wt \% Ag@AgBr, degrading 95.18\% methylene blue (MB) after 20 min
   of irradiation, which is over 1.52 and 3.56 times more efficient than
   that of pure Ag@AgBr and pure Bi2O2CO3, respectively. Bisphenol A (BPA)
   was also degraded to further demonstrate the degradation ability of
   Ag@AgBr/Bi2O2CO3. A photocatalytic mechanism for the degradation of
   organic compounds over Ag@AgBr/Bi2O2CO3 was proposed. Results from this

Abstract = {{A variety of oscillometric algorithms have been recently proposed in the
   literature for estimation of blood pressure (BP). However, these
   algorithms possess specific strengths and weaknesses that should be
   taken into account before selecting the most appropriate one. In this
   paper, we propose a fusion method to exploit the advantages of the
   oscillometric algorithms and circumvent their limitations. The proposed
   fusion method is based on the computation of the weighted arithmetic
   mean of the oscillometric algorithms estimates, and the weights are
   obtained using a Bayesian approach by minimizing the mean square error.
   The proposed approach is used to fuse four different oscillometric blood
   pressure estimation algorithms. The performance of the proposed method
   is evaluated on a pilot dataset of 150 oscillometric recordings from 10
   subjects. It is found that the mean error and standard deviation of
   error are reduced relative to the individual estimation algorithms by up
   to 7 mmHg and 3 mmHg in estimation of systolic pressure, respectively,
   and by up to 2 mmHg and 3 mmHg in estimation of diastolic pressure,
   respectively. (C) 2016 IPEM. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper presents a reliability analysis method on repairable system
   with standby structure based on goal oriented (GO) methodology. Firstly,
   a new combination of GO operator, which is composed of a new logical GO
   operator named Type 18A operator and a new auxiliary GO operator named
   Type 20 operator, is created to represent standby mode. The availability
   formula of standby equipment with translation exception is deduced based
   on Markov process theory. Then, the application method of combination of
   GO operator for standby mode and the analysis process of repairable
   system with standby structure based on GO method are proposed. Thirdly,
   this new combination of GO operator is applied in availability analysis
   of the hydraulic oil supply system of power-shift steering transmission.
   Finally, the results obtained by the new GO method are compared with the
   results of fault tree analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, GO methods using
   Type 2 operator and Type 18 operator to represent the standby mode,
   respectively. And the comparison results show that this new GO method is
   applicable and reasonable for reliability analysis of repairable system
   with standby structure. All in all, this paper provides guidance for
   reliability analysis of repairable systems with standby structure.

Abstract = {{The protein ( PN), polysaccharide ( PS), and extracellular DNA ( eDNA)
   percent concentrations of extracellular polymeric substances ( EPS) of
   biofilm samples harvested from a pilot-scale nitrifying moving bed
   biofilm reactor ( MBBR) were investigated at various operating
   temperatures and hydraulic retention times ( HRTs). Chemically measured
   EPS PN/PS ratios were shown to correlate to Raman intensity ratios of
   amide III to carbohydrate at 362 rel.cm(-1). The study also demonstrates
   that tertiary nitrifying MBBR systems may be optimized to operate at
   HRTs as low as 0.75 to 1.0 h as opposed to conventional HRTs of 2.0 to
   6.0 h. The EPS of the nitrifying MBBR biofilm exhibited the lowest
   percent PN content and the highest percent PSs and eDNA content. In
   particular, PN/PS ratios lower than 3 were indicative of non-optimal
   operation of the nitrifying MBBR systems, whereas PN/ PS ratios with
   values significantly below 3 were observed for ammonia underloaded
   systems at high operating temperatures and hydraulically overloaded
   systems at low HRTs. This study demonstrates that the PN/ PS ratio in
   EPS is a potential metric to identify non-optimal operation of
   nitrifying MBBR systems.}},

Title = {{Application-tailored optimisation of photonic crystal waveguides}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OPTICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Photonic crystal. (PhC) waveguides are used for a wide range of
   applications with diverse performance metrics. A waveguide optimised for
   one application may not be suitable for others and no one-size-fits-all
   solution exists. Therefore each application requires a specialised
   waveguide design, a computationally and time intensive process. Here, we
   present a hybrid, multi-objective optimisation routine for PhC
   waveguides, to efficiently guide the device design. The algorithm can be
   configured to optimise for a wide range of performance metrics and
   applications. We demonstrate optimisations for three different
   applications: slow light performance, propagation loss due to
   fabrication disorder and delay line applications. For each optimisation
   target, our routine quickly finds practical waveguide designs (<48 h, on
   a laptop computer) that match or exceed the performance of
   state-of-the-art devices designed by the community over the last 10
   years. This is also the first time that scattering loss from fabrication
   disorder has been incorporated into an optimisation algorithm, ensuring
   realistic predictions of a PhC waveguide design's practical performance.}},

Abstract = {{Personality plays an important role in various aspects of our daily
   life. It is being used in many application scenarios such as i)
   personalized marketing and advertisement of commercial products, ii)
   designing personalized ambient environments, iii) personalized avatars
   in virtual world, and iv) by psychologists to treat various mental and
   personality disorders. Traditional methods of personality assessment
   require a long questionnaire to be completed, which is time consuming.
   On the other hand, several works have been published that seek to
   acquire various personality traits by analyzing Internet usage
   statistics. Researchers have used Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and
   various other websites to collect usage statistics. However, we are
   still far from a successful outcome. This paper uses a range of
   divergent features of Facebook and LinkedIn social networks, both
   separately and collectively, in order to achieve better results. In this
   work, the big five personality trait model is used to analyze the five
   traits: openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion,
   agreeableness, and neuroticism. The experimental results show that the
   accuracy of personality detection improves with the use of complementary
   features of multiple social networks (Facebook and LinkedIn, in our
   case) for openness, conscientiousness, agreeableness, and neuroticism.
   However, for extroversion we found that the use of only LinkedIn
   features provides better results than the use of only Facebook features
   or both Facebook and LinkedIn features.}},

Abstract = {{High speed and high resolution interrogation of a fiber Bragg grating
   (FBG) sensor based on microwave photonic filtering and chirped microwave
   pulse compression is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. In the
   proposed sensor, a broadband linearly chirped microwave waveform (LCMW)
   is applied to a single-passband microwave photonic filter (MPF) which is
   implemented based on phase modulation and phase modulation to intensity
   modulation conversion using a phase modulator (PM) and a phase-shifted
   FBG (PS-FBG). Since the center frequency of the MPF is a function of the
   central wavelength of the PS-FBG, when the PS-FBG experiences a strain
   or temperature change, the wavelength is shifted, which leads to the
   change in the center frequency of the MPF. At the output of the MPF, a
   filtered chirped waveform with the center frequency corresponding to the
   applied strain or temperature is obtained. By compressing the filtered
   LCMW in a digital signal processor, the resolution is improved. The
   proposed interrogation technique is experimentally demonstrated. The
   experimental results show that interrogation sensitivity and resolution
   as high as 1.25 ns/mu epsilon and 0.8 mu epsilon are achieved. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Vibration analysis has been extensively used as an effective tool for
   bearing condition monitoring. The vibration signal collected from a
   defective bearing is, however, a mixture of several signal components
   including the fault feature (i.e. fault-induced impulses), periodic
   interferences from other mechanical/electrical components, and
   background noise. The incipient impulses which excite as well as
   modulate the resonance frequency of the system are easily masked by
   compounded effects of periodic interferences and noise, making it
   challenging to do a reliable fault diagnosis. As such, this paper
   proposes an envelope demodulation method termed short time fractal
   dimension (STFD) transform for fault feature extraction from such
   vibration signal mixture. STFD transform calculation related issues are
   first addressed. Then, by STFD, the original signal can be quickly
   transformed into a STFD representation, where the envelope of
   fault-induced impulses becomes more pronounced whereas interferences are
   partly weakened due to their morphological appearance differences. It
   has been found that the lower the interference frequency, the less
   effect the interference has on STFD representations. When interference
   frequency keeps increasing, more effects on STFD representations will be
   resulted. Such effects can be reduced by the proposed kurtosis-based
   peak search algorithm (KPSA). Therefore, bearing fault signature is kept
   and interferences are further weakened in the STFD-KPSA representation.
   The proposed method has been favourably compared with two widely used
   enveloping methods, i.e. multi-morphological analysis and energy
   operator, in terms of extracting impulse envelopes from vibration
   signals obscured by multiple interferences. Its performance has also
   been examined using both simulated and experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Chroma keying is a widely used video editing technique, which finely
   separates the foreground objects from the background. Two major concerns
   are involved in chroma keying problems: alpha estimation and foreground
   color restoration. The alpha values reveal the opacity property of the
   foreground objects. The foreground color restoration removes the
   background color influence to the foreground appearance especially at
   transparent regions and objects' boundaries. In this paper, the color
   range of the solid background is well analyzed to automatically separate
   foreground from background. Global sampling is utilized to robustly and
   reliably estimate the foreground color at boundaries and transparent
   regions. Furthermore, we propose to propagate the geometric shape of
   foreground boundaries between adjacent frames by using optical flow and
   thin plate splines interpolation. The trimap, which is an initial
   foreground/background/unknown segmentation of each frame can be
   automatically updated for each video frame by using our proposed
   propagation method. Compared to previous methods, our proposed matting
   method estimates high-quality alpha matte and reliable foreground color
   with least user interference.}},

Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{39-45}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The microbial oxidation of methane in biocover is considered a promising
   technology for the mitigation of methane emissions from landfills. In
   the present paper, the behaviour (evolution of methane and oxygen
   concentration, volumetric water content and temperature) and performance
   under freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) conditions are investigated by column
   experiments. In the utilizing of column experiments, three columns are
   developed, manufactured, prepared and treated by a period of methane
   injection (0 FTC), after 1 FTC and 2 FTCs, in three respective stages.
   One column is instrumented with various sensors to monitor the evolution
   of temperature, volumetric water content, settlement and gas composition
   at four different depths for one of the biocover columns. In addition,
   laboratory testing is carded out on the biocover samples with regards to
   their organic content and grain size distribution. The results show that
   two FTCs have effect on the methane removal of compost biocover as well
   as influence the evolution of the volumetric water content, temperature,
   settlement, gas composition and organic content of the biocover.
   However, these effects and influence are more significant in the upper
   layers (<= 15 cm) of the compost biocover column. The results presented
   in this paper will contribute to a better design of landfill biocovers
   in cold regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bismuth-based semiconductors are a unique and promising group of
   recently developed advanced photocatalytic materials. They have been
   widely applied in several areas including the generation of H-2 by

   harvesting the energy of light. The electronic structure of
   bismuth-based semiconductors confers them with a suitable band gap for

   simple to operate and prepare with controlled morphologies, making them
   attractive as potential photocatalysts. The purposes of this review are

Title = {{Modeling and performance evaluation of security attacks on opportunistic
   routing protocols for multihop wireless networks}},
Journal = {{AD HOC NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{88-101}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{In wireless networks, opportunistic routing (OR) protocols are designed
   to route data packets towards their destination with greater reliability
   than traditional routing schemes. In addition to reliability, nodes'
   trustworthiness and willingness to cooperate can also play a significant
   role in the delivery of packets to their final destinations. More
   specifically, nodes in the network may be compromised, experience
   software or hardware failures, or behave maliciously for various
   reasons. Therefore, it would be beneficial to model the behavior of
   malicious or uncooperative nodes and study their effects in a wireless
   network that employs OR for communications. In this paper, the behavior
   of malicious nodes in a wireless mesh network that utilizes unicast
   opportunistic routing protocols is modeled using Discrete Time Markov
   Chain (DTMC). Afterwards, using the proposed model, we introduce a novel
   approach for the calculation of packet drop ratio, through which the
   negative effects of uncooperative nodes can be calculated. Furthermore,
   a customized version of a black-hole attack is introduced as an example
   of malicious behavior in OR protocols; we apply this routing attack to
   several well-known OR protocols, with the additional use of network
   simulation as well as through the proposed analytical technique.
   Finally, a comprehensive set of performance evaluation scenarios is
   designed and applied, with the purpose of investigating the effects of
   different parameters on a wireless mesh network that uses OR as a
   routing approach in the presence of malicious nodes. Evaluation results
   indicate that the proposed black-hole attack can significantly downgrade
   communication performance, and the proposed model can properly model the
   effects of malicious nodes on OR protocols. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The Stiffness Damage Test (SDT) is an interesting tool for assessing
   damage in concrete affected by ASR. The use of a fixed loading level for
   stiffness damage testing, as previously suggested in the literature,
   limits its ability to reliably appraise the distress level of concrete
   samples, especially when different concrete strengths and aggregate
   types are used. Moreover, the test input and output parameters should be
   properly interpreted so that the SDT becomes a powerful diagnostic
   procedure. This paper presents an evaluation of the practical use of the
   SDT in engineering purposes. Results show that the use of output
   indices, i.e. SDI and PDI, instead of absolute output values, makes the
   procedure more diagnostic (i.e. not equal distress degrees can be easier
   distinguished) and less influenced by practical assumptions (e.g. choice
   of the loading level for stiffness damage testing). Based on the prior
   results, a step-by-step standard test procedure is proposed aiming to
   minimize the test variability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We report a non-resonance based approach to bearing fault detection.
   This is achieved by a higher order energy operator fusion (HOEO\_F)
   method. In this method, multiple higher order energy operators are fused
   to form a single simple transform to process the bearing signal obscured
   by noise and vibration interferences. The fusion is guided by entropy
   minimization. Unlike the popular high frequency resonance technique,
   this method does not require the information of resonance excited by the
   bearing fault. The effects of the HOEO\_F method on signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) are illustrated in
   this paper. The performance of the proposed method in handling noise and
   interferences has been examined using both simulated and experimental
   data. The results indicate that the HOEO\_F method outperforms both the
   envelope method and the original energy operator method. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Monomer reactivity ratios are important parameters used in
   copolymerization kinetics to predict the rate of polymerization,
   copolymer composition and monomer sequence length, and by extension,
   molecular weight and distribution of the final product. Batch aqueous
   solution copolymerizations of acrylic acid (AA) and itaconic acid (IA)
   are performed at various feed compositions. Polymerizations are
   categorized into low (<11 wt \%) conversion and higher (<30 wt \%)
   conversion data sets for analysis. Due to the limited solubility of IA
   in the reaction mixture, the feed composition of IA in all
   polymerizations is constrained to lower than 25 mol \%. Conversion is
   determined by gravimetric methods, and copolymer composition via H-1-NMR
   spectroscopy. All data are analyzed using the error-in-variables model
   (EVM) method. Two analyses are used, one with the EVM approach and
   another with a novel Direct Numerical Integration (DNI) coupled with the
   EVM method. The DNI/EVM approach yields values of r(AA) = 0.36 and r(IA)
   = 1.62 for the reactivity ratios. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Social media has been a convenient platform for users to maintain and
   share messages in different media types (e.g., image and video). Besides
   the sheer volume of data, various user social behaviors make the data
   socially related rather than existing independently. The social
   relevance between images caused by the user activities embeds human
   cognition towards the images, which is essential in many emerging
   applications but rarely represented by standard visual features.
   However, due to the heterogeneous social entities, contents and
   relationships, social image analysis is a challenging task. In this
   paper, we propose to decompose the heterogeneous social network into
   several homogeneous networks, on which the global relevance between
   social entities can be learned efficiently using a random walk style
   approach. Furthermore, the image social relevance is determined by
   propagating the learned relevance to image domain through the links
   between images and other networks. The proposed image social relevance
   is seamlessly integrated into several real-word applications, such as
   image tagging and re-ranking. Our experiment results demonstrate that
   the image social relevance, which can capture users' cognition on
   images, is a complementary to visual features, leading to significant
   performance improvements in both personalized and general applications.

Abstract = {{A silicon-based on-chip electrically-tunable spectral shaper for the
   generation of a tunable linearly chirped microwave waveform (LCMW) based
   on spectral shaping and wavelength-to-time (SS-WTT) mapping is designed,
   fabricated, and demonstrated. The on-chip spectral shaper has a
   Michelson interferometer structure with two linearly chirped waveguide
   Bragg gratings (LC-WBGs) incorporated in its two arms. Due to the
   wavelength-dependent length difference between the two arms of the
   interferometer, the spectral response of the spectral shaper exhibits a
   wavelength-dependent free spectral range, which is required for the
   generation of an LCMW based on SS-WTT mapping. To enable electrical
   tuning of the spectral response, a lateral PN junction is introduced to
   each of the waveguides where the LC-WBGs are inscribed. Thanks to the
   plasma dispersion effect, the spectral response of the spectral shaper
   can be tuned by changing the bias voltages applied to the PN junctions,
   which would lead to the tuning of the generated LCMW. A theoretical
   analysis on the LCMW generation is performed, which is verified by an
   experiment in which an electrically-tunable spectral shaper is
   fabricated using a CMOS-compatible process with 248-nm deep ultraviolet
   lithography. By independently controlling the bias voltages to the PN
   junctions, a continuous tuning of the generated LCMW is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a sub-bandgap photodetector consisting of a
   metal grating on a thin metal patch on silicon, which makes use of the
   enhancement produced by the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons at
   the metal-silicon interface. The grating is defined via e-beam
   lithography and Au lift-off on a Au patch defined beforehand by optical
   lithography on doped p-type silicon. The surface plasmon polaritons are
   absorbed by the metal, leading to the creation of hot holes that can
   cross into the silicon where they are collected as the photocurrent.
   Physical characterization of intermediate structure is provided along
   with responsivity measurements at telecom wavelengths. Results are
   promising in terms of responsivity, with a value of 13 mA/W measured at
   1550 nm - this is among the highest values reported to date for
   sub-bandgap detectors based on internal photoemission. The Schottky
   photodetector can be used in, e.g., non-contact wafer probing or in
   short-reach optical communications applications. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{Improved estimates of bubble dynamics in industrial gas-liquid fluid
   systems are important for accurately modeling multiphase flow. In many
   gas-liquid industrial systems at elevated pressure, bubbles exist in a
   polydisperse size population. This work experimentally characterizes the
   effects of bubble swarm polydispersity and gas holdup on drag using a
   monofibre optical probe in an ethanol contaminated aqueous system,
   providing an evaluation of current swarm drag models under industrially
   relevant pressures and high gas holdup conditions (up to 37\% gas
   fraction). At atmospheric pressure, the rise velocity and
   swarm-corrected drag of individual bubbles within a polydisperse
   distribution of bubbles was found to be well-predicted by the swarm
   correction model of Lockett and Kirkpatrick (1975). An improved fit to
   the reported data was found using a piecewise isolated single bubble
   drag coefficient correlation. At elevated pressures (6.5 MPa), swarm
   hindrance effects were not observed for detected bubbles and the rise
   velocity and drag coefficient of individual bubbles within a
   polydisperse distribution were well predicted without the use of a swarm
   correction model. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Surface plasmon photodetectors are of broad interest. They are promising
   for several applications including telecommunications, photovoltaic

   Virtual-Network as-a Service Offerings}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CLOUD COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Cloud clients (CCs) of current distributed cloud applications are still
   not assured of their service quality, in particular, in terms of the
   experienced latency. Unfortunately, this is mainly attributed to the
   unpredictability of the communication links among their hosting
   distributed data centers. To address this problem, this article
   introduces a novel virtual-network-as-a-service (VNaaS) model to host
   these applications. In contrast to existing randomly or statically
   provisioned inter-data centers bandwidth sharing models, the proposed
   model allows CCs to accurately express their varying network resources
   needs, demand constraints and tolerance to the cloud latency. In turn,
   the model maps these requirements to create inter-data centers virtual
   links hosting each multiple virtual pipes with differentiated service
   qualities to carry the CC's various traffic flows. To aid the CCs in
   optimally determining their VNaaS demands, given the budget constraints
   of their hosted applications, we also develop a novel demand selection
   scheme based on a two stage-budget allocation mechanism. In the first
   budgeting stage, the CC calculates an optimal effective service rate for
   each of its virtual link along with a corresponding link budget and
   price index. In the second stage, the virtual link budget is distributed
   to purchase bandwidth for the link's virtual pipes, each with a given
   service quality and pricing. We then extend the proposed model to allow
   the CC to enforce any required virtual links' capacity constraints on
   the effective service rates resulting from the traffic matrix on the
   VNaaS. Finally, we develop corresponding differentiated VNaaS pricing
   and service monitoring mechanisms that can be employed by the cloud
   service provider (CSP) to regulate the offerings and demands of the
   distributed cloud services. Performance evaluation results demonstrate
   the significant improvement in the service quality, the higher
   utilization of the cloud resources and the increase in the CSP's net
   profit.}},

Abstract = {{In the cloud era, data centers consume tremendous power due to their
   huge computing and storage requirements. Furthermore, allocation and
   release of resources by numerous cloud customers leads to significant
   energy consumption at the data centers, which in turn, increases the
   Operational expenditures (Opex) of the operators. In this article, we
   combine energy efficiency and Time of Use (ToU)-awareness, and propose a
   novel virtualization scheme, namely ToU-aware Provisioning (ToUP) for an
   inter-data center network over an IP over WDM backbone. In ToUP, in
   addition to the traffic between two backbone nodes, upstream user
   demands destined to data centers and downstream data center demands
   originating from many data centers; inter-data center traffic is also
   considered for workload sharing between the data centers. Initially, we
   present an MILP formulation to model the optimal behavior of ToUP. Since
   the inter-data center network needs to be reconfigured in polynomial
   time, we propose a simulated annealing (SA)-based heuristic. We verify
   the heuristic by using the MILP solution as the benchmark. We evaluate
   ToUP under various scenarios, and numerical results confirm that
   significant Opex savings can be achieved while demands can be
   provisioned with low energy consumption in the data centers and network
   equipments.}},

Title = {{A unified framework for evaluating the risk of re-identification of text
   de-identification tools}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{174-183}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Objectives: It has become regular practice to de-identify unstructured
   medical text for use in research using automatic methods, the goal of
   which is to remove patient identifying information to minimize
   re-identification risk. The metrics commonly used to determine if these
   systems are performing well do not accurately reflect the risk of a
   patient being re-identified. We therefore developed a framework for
   measuring the risk of re-identification associated with textual data
   releases.
   Methods: We apply the proposed evaluation framework to a data set from
   the University of Michigan Medical School. Our risk assessment results
   are then compared with those that would be obtained using a typical
   contemporary micro-average evaluation of recall in order to illustrate
   the difference between the proposed evaluation framework and the current
   baseline method.
   Results: We demonstrate how this framework compares against common
   measures of the re-identification risk associated with an automated text
   de-identification process. For the probability of re-identification
   using our evaluation framework we obtained a mean value for direct
   identifiers of 0.0074 and a mean value for quasi-identifiers of 0.0022.
   The 95\% confidence interval for these estimates were below the relevant
   thresholds. The threshold for direct identifier risk was based on
   previously used approaches in the literature. The threshold for
   quasi-identifiers was determined based on the context of the data
   release following commonly used de-identification criteria for
   structured data.
   Discussion: Our framework attempts to correct for poorly distributed
   evaluation corpora, accounts for the data release context, and avoids
   the often optimistic assumptions that are made using the more
   traditional evaluation approach. It therefore provides a more realistic
   estimate of the true probability of re-identification.
   Conclusions: This framework should be used as a basis for computing
   re-identification risk in order to more realistically evaluate future
   text de-identification tools. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {{During embryogenesis, the spherical inner cell mass (ICM) proliferates
   in the confined environment of a blastocyst. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs)
   are derived from the ICM, and mimicking embryogenesis in vitro, mouse
   ESCs (mESCs) are often cultured in hanging droplets. This promotes the
   formation of a spheroid as the cells sediment and aggregate owing to
   increased physical confinement and cell-cell interactions. In contrast,
   mESCs form two-dimensional monolayers on flat substrates and it remains
   unclear if the difference in organization is owing to a lack of physical
   confinement or increased cell-substrate versus cell-cell interactions.
   Employing microfabricated substrates, we demonstrate that a single
   geometric degree of physical confinement on a surface can also initiate
   spherogenesis. Experiment and computation reveal that a balance between
   cell-cell and cell-substrate interactions finely controls the morphology
   and organization of mESC aggregates. Physical confinement is thus an
   important regulatory cue in the three-dimensional organization and
   morphogenesis of developing cells.}},

Abstract = {{Oil debris signals are applied to monitor lubricant oil conditions and
   fault diagnosis of a wind turbine. However, the signals will be
   influenced by the vibration of transmission mechanism and background
   noise, hence false alarms and undetected particles will limit sensors
   ability in examining fine particles in oil debris. This paper presents
   an approach to enhance the performance of oil debris signals. The
   de-noising of signals used a wavelet filtering to remove the vibration
   of a wind turbine, and then set a threshold to remove the background
   noise which caused by the system of measurement. The effectiveness of
   this enhanced measurement system is tested by using simulated and
   experimental signals.}},

Abstract = {{Islet transplantation is an emerging strategy for treating patientswith
   type 1 diabetesmellitus. Although the proof of concept for cellular
   replacement therapy in diabetes has been firmly established, vascularity
   of the transplant site and the long-termsurvival and function of
   transplanted islets remains suboptimal. In the present study, human
   circulating angiogenic cells (CACs) and porcine islet cells embedded in
   collagen-chitosan hydrogels, with and without laminin, were investigated
   as potential engineered biomaterials for the treatment of type 1
   diabetes. Hydrogels were evaluated in vitro for their physical
   properties (compression, degradation, porosity and wettability) and cell
   compatibility. Increasing the chitosan content in the collagen-based
   hydrogel resulted in increased stiffness (p = 0.04) and time to gelation
   (p< 0.001), but reduced porosity (from 22-28\% to 16-19\%). The material
   design formulations (10:1 vs 20:1 collagen:chitosan ratio) directly
   affected the cell properties. The viability of both human CACs and
   porcine islets embedded in the 20:1 collagen-chitosan matrix was higher
   at 24 h compared to the 10:1 formulation. For islet function, glucose
   stimulation indices for the 20:1 formulation at 24 h compared favourably
   with values reported in the literature, more so than the 10:1
   formulations. While laminin improved the short-term viability of CACs,
   its presence did not confer any benefit to islet viability or function.
   Overall, the design features outlined in this study provided the degree
   of control required to establish viable tissue with potential for islet
   transplantation and neovascularization. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Natural methane (CH4) oxidation that is carried out through the use of
   landfill covers (biocovers) is a promising method for reducing CH4
   emissions from landfills. Previous studies on peat-based landfill covers
   have mainly focused on their biochemical properties (e.g. CH4 oxidation
   capacity). However, the utilization of peat as a cover material also
   requires a solid understanding of its geotechnical properties (thermal,
   hydraulic, and mechanical), which are critical to the performance of any
   biocover. Therefore, the objective of this context is to investigate and
   assess the geotechnical properties of peat-based cover materials (peat,
   peat-sand mixture), including compaction, consolidation, and hydraulic
   and thermal conductivities. The studied materials show high
   compressibility to the increase of vertical stress, with compression
   index (C-c) values ranging from 0.16 to 0.358. The compressibility is a
   function of sand content such that the peatesand mixture (1: 3) has the
   lowest C-c value. Both the thermal and hydraulic conductivities are
   functions of moisture content, dry density, and sand content. The
   hydraulic conductivity varies from 1.74 x 10(-9) m/s to 7.35 x 10(-9)
   m/s, and increases with the increase in sand content. The thermal
   conductivity of the studied samples varies between 0.54 W/(m K) and 1.41
   W/(m K) and it increases with the increases in moisture and sand
   contents. Increases in sand content generally increase the mechanical
   behavior of peat-based covers; however, they also cause relatively high
   hydraulic and thermal conductivities which are not favored properties
   for biocovers. (C) 2016 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics, Chinese

Title = {{Effect of Applying Force to Self-Adhesive Electrodes on Transthoracic
   Impedance: Implications for Electrical Cardioversion}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundCurrent guidelines disagree on the role for applying force to
   electrodes during electrical cardioversion (ECV) for atrial
   fibrillation, particularly when using self-adhesive pads. We evaluated
   the impact of this practice on transthoracic impedance (TTI) with
   varying force and in individuals with differing body mass indices (BMI).
   We additionally assessed whether specific prompts could improve
   physicians' ECV technique.
   MethodsThe study comprised three parts: (1) TTI was measured in 11
   participants throughout the respiratory cycle and with variable force
   applied to self-adhesive electrodes in anteroposterior (AP) and
   anterolateral (AL) configurations. (2) Three participants in different
   BMI classes then had TTI measured with prespecified incremental force
   applied. (3) Ten blinded cardiology trainees simulated ECV on one
   participant with and without prompting (guideline reminders and force
   analogies) while force applied and TTI were measured.
   ResultsThe AP approach was associated with 13\% lower TTI than AL (P <
   0.001). Strongly negative correlations were observed between force
   applied and TTI in the AL position, irrespective of BMI (P 0.003). In
   all cases, 80\% of the total reduction in TTI observed was achieved with
   8 kg-force (approximate to 80 N). All prompts resulted in significantly
   greater force applied and modest reductions in TTI.
   ConclusionsApplying force to self-adhesive electrodes reduces TTI and
   should be considered as a means of improving ECV success. Numerically
   greater mean force applied with a push-up force analogy suggests that
   concrete cues may be useful in improving ECV technique.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a combined calcium looping and chemical looping combustion
   (CaL-CLC) technology is simulated at thermodynamic equilibrium
   conditions and the results in terms of efficiency, power production, and
   solids circulation rates are compared with the case of using CaL alone.
   In addition, a new solids looping configuration in the CaL-CLC process
   is proposed with the purpose of mitigating the loss of calcium oxide
   conversion after high cycle numbers. Simulations show an improved
   process efficiency of the CaL-CLC method compared with CaL alone (34.2
   vs. 31.2\% higher heat value) and an increased power output (136 vs.
   110MW(e) additional power) due to the higher energy requirement to
   preheat the reactants. A sensitivity analysis of the process operating
   parameters highlights the particular importance of the temperature
   difference between reactors, which has a strong impact on the required
   mass of solids circulating in the loops. Finally, partial carbon dioxide
   capture scenarios are considered and indicate that lower capture levels
   are suitable to match regulation targets.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{96}},

Abstract = {{The discretization of the shallow water system on unstructured grids can
   lead to spurious modes which usually can affect accuracy and/or cause
   stability problems. This paper introduces a new approach for stability
   analysis of unstructured linear finite volume schemes for linear shallow
   water equations with the Coriolis Effect using spectra, pseudospectra,
   and singular value decomposition. The discrete operator of the scheme is
   the principal parameter used in the analysis. It is shown that
   unstructured grids have a large influence on operator normality. In some
   cases the eigenvectors of the operator can be far from orthogonal, which
   leads to amplification of solutions and/or stability problems. Large
   amplifications of the solution can be observed, even for discrete
   operators which respect the condition of asymptotic stability, and in
   some cases even for Lax Richtmyer stable methods. The pseudospectra are
   shown to be efficient for the verification of stability of finite volume
   methods for linear shallow water equations. In some cases, the singular
   value decomposition is employed for further analysis in order to provide
   more information about the existence of unstable modes. The results of
   the analysis can be helpful in choosing the type of mesh, the
   appropriate placements of the variables of the system on the grid, and
   the suitable discretization method which is stable for a wide range of
   modes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This mixed methods study explores automatic methods for expert model
   construction using multiple textual explanations of a problem situation.
   In particular, this study focuses on the key concepts of an expert
   model. While an expert understanding of a complex problem situation
   provides critical reference points for evidence-based formative
   assessment and feedback, the extraction of those reference points has
   proven challenging. Building upon semantic analysis, this study utilizes
   deep natural language processing techniques to facilitate the automatic
   extraction of key concepts from textual explanations written by experts.
   The study addresses the following question: (a) whether experts in a
   domain represent a common understanding of a problem situation through
   shared key concepts, (b) which metrics extract key concepts from textual
   data most accurately, and (c) whether automatic methods enable expert
   model construction from a corpus of textual explanations instead of a
   pre-defined, ideal explanation created using the Delphi method. The
   OntoCmap tool was used to extract concepts from multiple textual
   explanations and to generate diverse metrics assigned to each concept.
   The findings indicate that (a) experts have varying ways of
   understanding a problem situation, (b) graph-based filtering metrics
   (i.e., betweenness and reachability) performed better in building a set
   of key concepts, and (c) a single, pre-defined explanation led to a more
   accurate set of key concepts than a corpus of explanations from various
   experts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of lignin-derived cyclohexanol on combustion, performance and

   naturally aspirated and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) modes}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{181}},

Abstract = {{There is an attractive opportunity for commissioning bio-refineries in
   rural areas of India, to process the abundant ligno-cellulosic biomass
   available from the country's vast fertile lands and produce value-added
   bio-fuels for powering stationary diesel engines meant for irrigation
   and rural electrification. In this background, cyclohexanol, a
   lignin-derived cyclic-oxygenate is tested in a single-cylinder
   direct-injection agricultural diesel engine as blend component (up to
   30\% by vol.) with fossil diesel and an investigation is carried out to
   evaluate its impact on the engine's combustion, emission and performance
   characteristics under both naturally aspirated and exhaust gas
   recirculation (EGR) modes. Results indicated that addition of
   cyclohexanol increased ignition delay with higher peaks of in-cylinder
   pressure and heat release rates during the premixed combustion phase.
   Brake thermal efficiency decreased slightly (up to 4\%) while brake
   specific fuel consumption suffered with increasing cyclohexanol fraction
   in the blends. From emissions standpoint, increase in cyclohexanol
   content reduced smoke opacity (up to 32.3\%) while NOx (oxides of
   nitrogen) increased at high loads. HC (hydrocarbons) and CO
   (carbon-monoxide) emissions increased with cyclohexanol addition.
   Nevertheless lower levels of NOx (up to 61\%) and smoke opacity (up to
   14.2\%) can be realized with 30\% cyclohexanol/diesel blends under 30\%
   EGR. It can be concluded from this field trial that an agricultural
   diesel engine, without any modifications, can run successfully with a
   blend up to 30\% cyclohexanol/70\% fossil diesel without any damage to
   the engine parts. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{163}},

Abstract = {{Comparable intracellular concentrations (approximate to 130 pmol/10(6)
   cells) of bovine serum albumin-ZnPc (BSA) adduct outperformed
   dipalmitoyl-phosphatidyl-choline (DPPC) liposomes containing ZnPc at
   photodynamic-killing of human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) after only 15
   min of irradiation using red light (lambda > 620 nm, 30 W/cm(2)). This
   result could not be simply explained in terms of dye aggregation within
   the carrier, since in the liposomes the dye was considerably less
   aggregated than in bovine serum albumin, formulation that was capable to
   induce cell apoptosis upon red light exposure. Thus, using specific
   organelle staining, our cumulative data points towards intrinsic
   differences in intra-cellular localization depending on the cargo
   vehicle used, being ZnPc:BSA preferentially located in the near vicinity
   of the nucleus and in the Golgi structures, while the liposomal
   formulation ZnPc:DPPC was preferentially located in cellular membrane
   and cytoplasm. In addition to those differences, using real-time
   advanced fluorescence lifetime imaging of HeLa cells loaded with the
   photosensitizer contained in the different vehicles, we have found that
   only for the ZnPc:BSA formulation, there was no significant changes in
   the fluorescence lifetime of the photosensitizer inside the cells. This
   contrasts with the in situ two-fold reduction of the fluorescence
   lifetime measured for the liposomal ZnPc formulation. Those observations
   point towards the superiority of the protein to preserve dye
   aggregation, and its photochemical activity, post-cell uptake,
   demonstrating the pivotal role of the delivery vehicle at determining
   the ultimate fate of a photosensitizer. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Bridge deck construction using stay-in-place (SIP) fiber-reinforced
   polymer (FRP) structural forms has shown promise as an efficient, rapid,
   and low-waste alternative to conventional methods. Several studies have
   shown that the load capacity of this system is typically governed by
   punching shear strength, although no design-oriented equations have yet
   been developed to predict failure load or deflection at service. In this
   paper, two simple design equations are proposed for the ultimate load
   and stiffness of concrete deck slabs with SIP FRP forms, derived from
   the results of a comprehensive parametric study using a rigorous
   finite-difference computer model that is readily available. The
   equations were then validated by using experimental results from a
   database of 52 tests reported in the literature including FRP SIP forms
   of several shapes, sizes, surface treatments, spliced connections,
   boundary conditions, environmental exposures, and loading protocols. The
   equations showed an average predicted-to-experimental nominal strength
   of 87\% with a standard deviation of 19\%. When applying the design code
   member resistance factor of 0.75 consistent with shear failure of
   FRP-reinforced decks, a conservative strength was predicted for the
   entire database. Stiffness, on the other hand, was less accurately
   predicted; however, the model provided reliable and accurate indication
   of whether deflection limit is satisfied or not. (C) 2016 American

Abstract = {{The multi-variable grey model represented by GM(1,N) is an important
   causal relationship forecasting model. However, since the structure of
   GM(1,N) is more complicated than that of the single-variable grey
   forecasting model GM(1,1), it is difficult to build a useful GM(1,N)
   model. The simulation and prediction errors of GM(1,N) models are
   usually greater than those of GM(1,1) models. The modeling process of
   the traditional GM(1,N) model is studied and three serious defects are
   observed in terms of ``modeling mechanism{''}, ``parameter
   estimation{''} and ``model structure{''}, which are the major causes of
   low model precision. In this paper, a novel GM(1,N) model is proposed to
   improve the performance of the traditional GM(1,N) model by introducing
   a linear correction term and a grey action quantity term to the
   traditional GM(1,N) model. The new model has more reasonable modeling
   process and more stable structure, which solves the three defects of the
   traditional GM(1,N) model. In addition, the new model is entirely
   compatible with the single variable discrete grey forecasting model
   DGM(1,1)and the multi-variable grey forecasting model GM(0,N). To verify
   the effectiveness of the development, the new model is used to simulate
   the tensile strength of a material. The mean relative simulation and
   prediction percentage errors of the new model are 0.0707\% and 5.7369\%,
   in comparison with those of the traditional precision GM(1,N) model and
   the classical GM(1,1) model, which are 6.0011\%, 18.4280\% and 1.1020\%,
   12.5190\% respectively. The findings show that the new model has the
   best performance, which on one hand testifies the correctness of the
   defect analysis, and on the other hand validates the effectiveness of
   the structure reform of the traditional GM(1,N) model. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Free radical emulsion terpolymerizations of conjugated linoleic acid
   (CIA), styrene (Sty), and butyl acrylate (BA) were performed at 80
   degrees C. Terpolymers were characterized for composition, conversion,
   molecular weight and glass transition temperature, latexes were
   characterized for viscosity and particle size while adhesives were
   characterized for tack, peel strength, shear strength, storage modulus,
   loss modulus and tan delta. One impurity commonly found in CIA, oleic
   acid, was shown to influence the reaction kinetics significantly.
   Adhesive performance was tuned using divinylbenzene (DVB) crosslinker to
   keep the terpolymer molecular weight in a desired range. By using a
   constrained mixture design, the influence of terpolymer composition,
   chain transfer agent (CTA) concentration, DVB concentration, molecular
   weights, viscosity and particle size on tack, peel strength and shear
   strength was investigated. The final forms of the resulting empirical
   models allowed the creation of 3D response surfaces for pressure
   sensitive adhesive (PSA) performance optimization. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{With an ever-increasing accessibility to different multimedia contents
   in real-time, it is difficult for users to identify the proper resources
   from such a vast number of choices. By utilizing the user's context
   while consuming diverse multimedia contents, we can identify different
   personal preferences and settings. However, there is a need to reinforce
   the recommendation process in a systematic way, with context-adaptive
   information. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, we
   propose a framework, called RecAm, which enables the collection of
   contextual information and the delivery of resulted recommendation by
   adapting the user's environment using Ambient Intelligent (AmI)
   Interfaces. Second, we propose a recommendation model that establishes a
   bridge between the multimedia resources, user joint preferences, and the
   detected contextual information. Hence, we obtain a comprehensive view
   of the user's context, as well as provide a personalized environment to
   deliver the feedback. We demonstrate the feasibility of RecAm with two
   prototypes applications that use contextual information for
   recommendations. The offline experiment conducted shows the improvement
   of delivering personalized recommendations based on the user's context
   on two real-world datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Diesel engines do not have the luxury of a thoroughly premixed charge
   like gasoline engines. Fossil-diesel auto-ignites quickly after its
   injection, resulting in high smoke and NOx emissions due to
   heterogeneous fuel/air distribution and high combustion temperatures.
   Injection timing modification and exhaust gas re-circulation can provide
   ample duration for air and fuel to pre-mix `inside' the cylinder and
   burn under low temperatures which reduces harmful NOx/smoke in a diesel
   engine simultaneously. This study proposes the use of three advanced
   biofuels with a low cetane number, viz. dimethyl carbonate (DMC),
   iso-butanol and n-pentanol with blend-ratios of 15, 38 and 45 vol\% in
   diesel, respectively (that corresponds to a uniform oxygen-content of
   8\%) in a single-cylinder DI diesel engine. The engine characteristics
   were investigated under high loads@1500 rpm by controlling the charge
   dilution and combustion phasing using moderate EGR rates and start of
   injection (SOI) modification. The blends presented large amounts of
   premixed combustion that resulted in high in-cylinder pressures and heat
   release rates. Results indicated that NOx and smoke could be
   simultaneously reduced using the combination of the proposed advanced
   biofuel/diesel blends, late injection and moderate EGR rates. However,
   there is an increase in HC and CO emissions at all test conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional numerical model is presented for the simulation of
   unsteady non-hydrostatic shallow water flows on unstructured grids using
   the finite volume method. The free surface variations are modeled by a
   characteristics-based scheme, which simulates sub-critical and
   super-critical flows. Three-dimensional velocity components are
   considered in a collocated arrangement with a sigma-coordinate system. A
   special treatment of the pressure term is developed to avoid the water
   surface oscillations. Convective and diffusive terms are approximated
   explicitly, and an implicit discretization is used for the pressure term
   to ensure exact mass conservation. The unstructured grid in the
   horizontal direction and the sigma coordinate in the vertical direction
   facilitate the use of the model in complicated geometries. Solution of
   the non-hydrostatic equations enables the model to simulate short-period
   waves and vertically circulating flows. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Nanocomposite membranes were prepared for vacuum membrane distillation
   (VMD) by casting the dope suspension on top of a nonwoven polyester
   backing material. The dope consisted of 7.0 wt \% hydrophilic SiO2
   nanoparticles and a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) blend Of high
   molecular weight (H) and low molecular weight (L). The effects of the
   blend ratio (H:L) and the penetration time (tau), defined as the period
   between the completion of membrane casting and the immersion in the
   coagulation bath, on the membrane properties and performance were
   studied. It was found that the VMD flux is governed by the pore size and
   thickness of the top layer (defined as the layer formed above the
   backing material), both of which are affected by the ELL ratio and the
   penetration time. Results indicate that the VMD flux increased as the
   portion of L in the casting dope increased at constant. tau, while a
   maximum flux was observed at tau = 2 min when the penetration time was
   changed at constant H:L ratio. It was also observed that the liquid
   entry pressure of water (LEPw) of membranes changed with the PVDF blend
   ratio and penetration time due to alteration of the maximum pore size.
   Considering all the data collected, the combination of H:L = 2:8 and
   penetration time of 3 min was identified as the best condition for the
   preparation of nanocomposite membranes, achieving one of the highest VMD
   fluxes, 12.1 kg/m(2) h at 27.5 degrees C and 1.2 kPa, an improved LEPw
   of 27.0 prig, and a near complete NaCl rejection.}},

Title = {{The derivative-free Fourier shell identity for photoacoustics}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{In X-ray tomography, the Fourier slice theorem provides a relationship
   between the Fourier components of the object being imaged and the
   measured projection data. The Fourier slice theorem is the basis for
   X-ray Fourier-based tomographic inversion techniques. A similar
   relationship, referred to as the `Fourier shell identity' has been
   previously derived for photoacoustic applications. However, this
   identity relates the pressure wavefield data function and its normal
   derivative measured on an arbitrary enclosing aperture to the
   three-dimensional Fourier transform of the enclosed object evaluated on
   a sphere. Since the normal derivative of pressure is not normally
   measured, the applicability of the formulation is limited in this form.
   In this paper, alternative derivations of the Fourier shell identity in
   1D, 2D polar and 3D spherical polar coordinates are presented. The
   presented formulations do not require the normal derivative of pressure,
   thereby lending the formulas directly adaptable for Fourier based
   absorber reconstructions.}},

Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The flow regimes and mass transfer rates in five complex micro-reactors
   with different mixing mechanisms were investigated using the two-phase
   alkaline hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate. n-Butanol and toluene were
   used as organic solvents. Using n-butanol in curvature-based
   micro-mixers, the flow regime evolved from slug to parallel to
   drop/dispersed flow with increasing flow rates. In obstacle based
   micro-mixers, no parallel flow was observed. Using toluene, no parallel
   flow was observed for all reactors. The conversion of 4-nitrophenyl
   acetate was found to be strongly dependent on the flow regime. In slug
   and parallel flow, the conversion generally decreased with an increase
   in flow rate whereas it typically increased in drop flow and was
   constant or slightly decreased in dispersed flow. The different
   micro-mixers were compared using the overall volumetric mass transfer
   coefficient, K(org)a, which was primarily a function of the rate of
   energy dissipation within the dispersed flow regime. The geometry itself
   impacts the resulting flow regime and rate of energy dissipation at a
   given flow rate. The micro-reactors were then compared using modified
   Damkohler's numbers. Curvature-based reactors were found to be
   inadequate for liquid-liquid reactions under the studied conditions, as
   they favor parallel flow patterns and yield relatively low interphase
   mass transfer rates. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, intrinsically-porous aggregates of nanosheets having
   mono-, di-, and tri-modal particle size distributions were synthesized
   to produce densely-packed dynamic membranes. Alumina nanosheets were
   synthesized in 0, 25, and 50 vol\% ethanol-water mixtures (Al-0, Al-25,
   and Al-50, respectively). Using dynamic image analysis, it was
   determined that the alumina nanosheets twinned to form aggregate
   superstructures of distinct size distributions at each synthesis
   condition. The aggregates were intrinsically porous with
   three-dimensional pore connectivity. Dynamic membranes (DMs) were formed
   by the deposition of these aggregates on a substrate. The effect of
   ethanol content in the synthesis mixture on the performance of the DMs
   was investigated during the constant-pressure filtration of a bentonite
   solution. The results show that the Al-50 DM had the best performance
   based on flux and turbidity removal. The Al-50 DM reached the required
   turbidity level of <0.10 NTU at a flux that was 177\% and 12\% higher
   than the fluxes obtained by the Al-0 and Al-25 DMs, respectively. The
   superior performance of the Al-50 DM was explained by the presence of
   three aggregate size distributions providing optimal packing in the
   synthesized material. This reduced interstitial pores and resulted in a
   packing density of 74.7-78.5\% versus 54.0-54.2\% for Al-0. (C) 2016

   for shallow water flows}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{136}},
Pages = {{193-206}},
Month = {{SEP 10}},
Abstract = {{We develop a new second-order two-dimensional central-upwind scheme on
   cell-vertex grids for approximating solutions of the Saint-Venant system
   with source terms due to bottom topography. Central upwind schemes are
   developed based on the information about the local speeds of wave
   propagation. Compared to the triangular central-upwind schemes, the
   proposed cell-vertex one has an advantage of using more cell interfaces
   which provide more information on the waves propagating in different
   directions. We propose a new piecewise linear approximation of the
   bottom topography and a novel non oscillatory reconstruction in which
   the gradient of each variable is computed using a modified minmod-type
   method to ensure the stability of the scheme. A new technique is
   proposed for the correction of the water surface elevation which
   guarantees the positivity of the water depth. The well-balanced property
   of the proposed central-upwind scheme is ensured using a special
   discretization for the cell averages of the topography source terms. The
   proposed scheme is tested on a number of numerical examples, among which
   we consider steady-state solutions with almost dry areas and their
   perturbations and solutions with rapidly varying flows over
   discontinuous bottom topography. Our numerical experiments confirm
   stability, well-balanced, positivity preserving properties and
   second-order accuracy of the proposed method. This scheme can be applied
   to shallow water models when the bed topography is discontinuous and/or
   highly oscillatory, and on complicated domains where the use of
   unstructured grids is advantageous. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Several commercially available adsorbents that show promise for the
   separation of CH4 from N-2 including different activated carbons,
   desiccants, and zeolites were evaluated using single component
   adsorption isotherms of pure methane and nitrogen that were measured at
   303 K for pressures of up to 10 atm using the gravimetric method.
   Following the screening, the adsorption of binary gas mixtures composed
   of methane and nitrogen were studied at 303 K and two different
   pressures on the adsorbents with the highest capacity for CH4 of each of
   the activated carbons, desiccants, and zeolites. These selected
   adsorbents included commercial zeolite 13X (Siliporite Nitroxy Pro from
   CECA Arkema Group), activated carbon (Xtrusorb A754 from Calgon Carbon
   Corp.), and silica gel (SG-B127 from Grace \& Co). A concentration pulse
   chromatographic method was used to determine the pure component CH4 and
   N-2 Henrys Law constants, heats of adsorption, and the experimental
   binary adsorption isotherms for the three selected adsorbents. The
   effect of pressure on the binary CH4N2 system was examined at 1 and 4
   atm total pressures. The experimental equilibrium binary adsorption
   isotherm behavior was compared to the predictions based on the Extended
   Langmuir Model and the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory using the
   parameters from the pure component adsorption isotherms. The
   experimental equilibrium data for each adsorbent were compared through
   XY phase diagrams and selectivity curves. Both binary models show only a
   modest ability to describe adsorption equilibria of the binary system on
   activated carbon, silica gel, and 13X. The experimental binary CH4/N-2
   selectivity was shown to be different than the pure component data
   suggests for all of the adsorbents, indicating some competitive
   adsorption of CH4 and N-2 in the binary system. Results of this study
   showed that for this system, 13X zeolite had a combination of the lowest
   binary selectivity and the highest heats of adsorption. Silica gel had
   low heats of adsorption for both N-2 and CH4, but higher methane
   selectivity at high methane concentrations. Activated carbon provided
   high binary equilibrium selectivity and high capacity among the studied
   adsorbents, which has good implications for this gas separation
   application of natural gas treatment.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a pressure cell apparatus is developed to investigate the
   early age evolution of the strength and deformation behaviour of
   cemented paste backfill (CPB) when subjected to various loading
   conditions under different curing scenarios. The different curing
   scenarios that are simulated include: (1) drained and undrained
   conditions, (2) different filling rates, (3) different filling
   sequences, and (4) different curing stresses. The findings show that
   drainage, curing stress, curing time and filling rate influence the
   mechanical and deformation behaviours of CPB materials. The coupled
   effects of consolidation, drainage and suction contribute to the
   strength development of drained CPB subjected to curing stress. On the
   other hand, particle rearrangement caused by the applied pressure and
   suction development due to self-desiccation plays a significant role in
   the strength gain of undrained CPB cured under stress. Furthermore,
   curing stress induces slightly faster rate of cement hydration, which
   can contribute to strength acquisition. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Unlike normal diffusion, in anomalous diffusion, the movement of a
   molecule is described by the correlated random walk model where the mean
   square displacement of a molecule depends on the power law of time. In
   molecular communication (MC), there are many scenarios when the
   propagation of molecules cannot be described by normal diffusion
   process, where anomalous diffusion is a better fit. In this paper, the
   effects of anomalous subdiffusion on concentration-encoded molecular
   communication (CEMC) are investigated. Although classical (i.e., normal)
   diffusion is a widely-used model of diffusion in molecular communication
   (MC) research, anomalous subdiffusion is quite common in biological
   media involving bio-nanomachines, yet inadequately addressed as a
   research issue so far. Using the fractional diffusion approach, the
   molecular propagation effects in the case of pure subdiffusion occurring
   in an unbounded three-dimensional propagation medium have been shown in
   detail in terms of temporal dispersion parameters of the impulse
   response of the subdiffusive channel. Correspondingly, the bit error
   rate (BER) performance of a CEMC system is investigated with
   sampling-based (SD) and strength (i.e., energy)-based (ED) signal
   detection methods. It is found that anomalous subdiffusion has
   distinctive time-dispersive properties that play a vital role in
   accurately designing a subdiffusive CEMC system. Unlike normal
   diffusion, to detect information symbols in subdiffusive CEMC, a
   receiver requires larger memory size to operate correctly and hence a
   more complex structure. An in-depth analysis has been made on the
   performances of SD and ED optimum receiver models under diffusion noise
   and intersymbol interference (ISI) scenarios when communication range,
   transmission data rate, and memory size vary. In subdiffusive CEMC, the
   SD method and OOK modulation are found to provide lower BER than the ED
   method and ASK modulation respectively.(1)}},

Abstract = {{Based on previous work studying complex microreactors, it was desired to
   further improve the mixing efficiency by varying the mixing unit design
   for fast liquid-liquid reactions. Different flow regimes were studied,
   including slug flow, parallel flow, and drop flow. The two-phase
   hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate in sodium hydroxide solution was
   used to evaluate the overall volumetric mass transfer coefficients
   (K(org)a) as a function of the average rate of energy dissipation
   (epsilon) for each microreactor design and all flow regimes. The
   liquid-liquid systems investigated used n-butanol or toluene as the
   organic phase solvent and a 0.5-M NaOH aqueous solution. The use of
   surfactant was also investigated with the toluene-water system. All
   microreactor geometry designs were based on contraction-expansion
   repeating units with asymmetric obstacles to aid the breakup of slugs
   and desynchronize the recombination of split streams. The investigated
   designs were chosen to avoid the formation of the parallel flow regime,
   contrary to curvature-based mixing-unit designs. The microreactor design
   can then be optimized to reduce the e required to reach drop flow, since
   K(org)a has been found to be constant at equal epsilon for a given
   solvent system in this flow regime, regardless of the reactor selection.
   Additionally, the ``3/7th{''} scale-up rule was applied and confirmed
   with the LL-Triangle mixer. It was found that, for low
   interfacial-tension systems (i.e., n-butanol-water), the onset of drop
   flow occurred at a lower e for the LL-Triangle mixer when compared with
   the Sickle or LL-Rhombus mixers.}},

Title = {{Temperature dependence of the reactivity of cemented paste backfill}},
Journal = {{APPLIED GEOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{72}},
Pages = {{10-19}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The environmental performance of cemented paste backfill (CPB; a mixture
   of tailings, water and binder), which contains sulphide mineral-bearing
   tailings, is strongly influenced by its reactivity. However, our
   understanding of the reactivity of CPB under various thermal loading
   conditions as well as its evolution with time is limited. Hence, a
   laboratory investigation is conducted to study the effects of curing and
   ambient (atmospheric) temperatures on the reactivity of CPB. Oxygen
   consumption (OC) tests are conducted on CPB specimens cured at different
   temperatures to study their reactivity. Furthermore, microstructural
   analyses (e.g., x-ray diffraction (XRD), mercury intrusion porosimetry,
   and thermogravimetry/derivative thermogravimetry) are performed to
   assess the microstructural characteristics of the tested CPBs. The
   results show that the reactivity of CPB is temperature-dependent. As the
   curing temperature increases, the reactivity generally decreases. The
   reactivity is also affected by the ambient temperature. The reactivity
   increases as the atmospheric temperature increases. However, the extent
   of the effect of the temperature depends on the curing time and is
   generally more pronounced at the early ages. Furthermore, the presence
   of sulphate in the pore water of CPB can significantly affect the
   reactivity of CPB cured at high temperatures (50 degrees C). The
   findings of this study will therefore help to better assess and predict
   the environmental behavior of CPB under various field thermal
   conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an automatic, human perception based chroma-keying
   algorithm that extracts the objects of interest (i.e. foreground) from
   monochromatic background. Given an image to be chroma keyed, the global
   colour distribution and the local texture property are analysed in
   CIECAM02 colour appearance model. After the analysis, input image is
   automatically segmented into three parts: foreground, background, and
   uncertain regions. Afterwards, the background colour is propagated from
   known background to uncertain region by using interpolation functions;
   and the foreground colour is estimated based on global colour
   distribution and a linear cost criteria. The quantitative and perceptual
   comparisons on the matting results show that the proposed method can
   reliably remove the background region, correctly restore the intrinsic
   foreground colour, and accurately keep the fine details. In addition,
   the authors implement the proposed method on a heterogeneous parallel
   computing architecture which efficiently distributes the workload among

   Variable Inertia Flywheel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a flywheel that can adaptively generate
   variable equivalent mass in response to application requirements. The
   motivation for the design comes from the need to achieve passive
   inertial mass, which eventually will lead to passive vibration
   isolation. This flywheel features a ``host{''} flywheel frame with four
   sliders, each in a separate track. As the rotational speed of the
   variable inertia flywheel changes, the distance between sliders and
   rotation center changes, leading to a variable equivalent mass. The
   mathematical model of the flywheel is developed to examine its
   performance. The flywheel is mounted on a two-terminal hydraulic device
   to test its behavior. Experimental work has also been carried out to
   identify the parameters of the system (hydraulic device plus flywheel).
   The mathematical model with the identified parameters is then validated
   experimentally. During the experiments, the variable inertial force
   generated by the variable inertia flywheel in response to the changes in
   the excitation inputs is in good agreement with the prediction of the
   mathematical model, with the exception of spikes due to backlash of the
   twoterminal hydraulic system. The proposed design and experimental
   approach could inspire other passive variable inertial mass control of
   vibration systems.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting large animals on roadways using automated systems such as
   robots or vehicles is a vital task. This can be achieved using
   conventional tools such as ultrasonic sensors, or with innovative
   technology based on smart cameras. In this paper, we investigate a
   vision-based solution. We begin the paper by performing a comparative
   study between three detectors: 1) Haar-AdaBoost; 2) histogram of
   oriented gradient (HOG)-AdaBoost; and 3) local binary pattern
   (LBP)-AdaBoost, which were initially developed to detect humans and
   their faces. These detectors are implemented, evaluated, and compared to
   each other in terms of accuracy and processing time. Based on our
   evaluation and comparison results, we design a two-stage architecture
   which outperforms the aforementioned detectors. The proposed
   architecture detects candidate regions of interest using LBP-AdaBoost in
   the first stage, which offers robustness to false positives in real-time
   conditions. The second stage is based on support vector machine
   classifiers that were trained using HOG features. The training data are
   generated from our novel dataset called large animal dataset, which
   contains common and thermographic images of large road-animals. We
   emphasize that no such public dataset currently exists.}},

Abstract = {{The application of microwave (MW) radiation followed by aeration (A) for
   ammonia removal from synthetic solutions was investigated in this study.
   Results confirmed that the sequential microwave/aeration process was an
   effective approach for removal of ammonia from aqueous systems. Maximum
   ammonia removal of 81.7\% for 100mL synthetic solution was achieved by
   applying 650W microwave radiation (50\% of the maximum MW power output)
   over 120-s MW irradiation time followed by 10-minute aeration. One-way
   ANOVA tests and t-tests were conducted for the analysis of the
   differences in ammonia removal efficiencies among different methods.
   Among the three main contributions for the ammonia removal for the
   sequential microwave/aeration process (thermal effect, electromagnetic
   field (EMF) generated by MW radiation, and aeration process), the
   contribution of the EMF becomes increasingly significant with the
   increase of MW radiation time, except at a pH of 10. Under the optimum
   operation condition, the contribution of thermal process, EMF, and
   aeration was 39, 28, and 33\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes comprehensive experimental studies on the
   soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) and the variation of several
   mechanical properties with respect to suction for a compacted glacial
   till collected from Indian Head, Saskatchewan, Canada (referred to as
   Indian Head till). The summarized mechanical properties include the
   shear strength, unconfined compression strength, undrained elastic
   modulus, and resilient modulus which were either directly measured or
   back-calculated from the experimental results. A unified model is used
   to predict the variation of the mechanical properties with respect to
   suction. This model only requires the information of the mechanical
   property at saturated condition and one reference unsaturated condition
   and the SWCC for prediction. The advantage of this model is that it uses
   one constant model parameter that does not need to be calibrated. It is
   demonstrated that the model is capable of reliably predicting all the
   mechanical properties of the compacted Indian Head till. The mechanical
   properties are then used in numerical software Plaxis to model the
   load-settlement behavior of model footing tests performed on compacted
   Indian Head till. There is good agreement between the measured and
   modelled load-settlement behavior and the bearing capacity at various
   suction levels. Studies presented in this paper using the unified model
   would be helpful for implementing the mechanics of unsaturated soils in

Abstract = {{Compacted fine-grained soils are widely used in the construction of
   geotechnical infrastructures such as the embankments, retaining walls
   and pavements. These infrastructures are typically constructed at a
   relatively fast rate such that the pore-water phase is not allowed to
   drain, or under constant water content (CW) condition. The mechanical
   behaviour of compacted fine-grained soils under CW condition should be
   well understood in addition to various other loading conditions for
   rational design of geotechnical infrastructures. In this study,
   compacted soil specimens of a residual gneiss from Brazil were tested
   using a conventional triaxial testing equipment under CW condition. A
   high capacity tensiometer was used to measure the matric suction in the
   compacted soil specimens. Three groups of soil specimens compacted at
   different initial water contents representing dry of optimum, optimum
   and wet of optimum conditions were tested to study the influence of soil
   structure on the matric suction development in the soil specimens during
   testing. The test results suggest that the matric suction changes in the
   soil under CW condition depend mainly on the volume change behavior,
   which is influenced by the level of confining pressure, the degree of
   saturation and the soil structure. The simple conventional triaxial
   testing equipment has been found to be useful for determining the
   mechanical behavior of compacted fine-grained soils under CW condition
   with the aid of a high capacity tensiometer.}},

Abstract = {{The study of water movement in unsaturated soils under non isothermal
   conditions requires understanding the soil water characteristic curves
   (SWCC) as a function of temperature. Physical processes such as water
   permeability, and shear strength of unsaturated soils are a function of
   the SWCC. These curves are generally assumed to be a unique relationship
   for a soil for all practical purposes. However, factors such as
   temperature and volume change can affect this uniqueness. The aim of
   this paper is to present a rational approach to describe the effect of
   temperature on the SWCC under isothermal conditions. A simple equation
   based on the relationship between temperature and the capillary rise is
   applied to find the air entry value at different temperatures when its
   value is known at a reference temperature. The same equation can be
   applied to the residual water content term of the SWCC. An experimental
   procedure for two different coarse-grained soils in the low suction
   range (i.e., 0-30 kPa) at three different temperatures (4, 20, and )
   were conducted to validate the proposed approach. The comparison between
   experimental results, published SWCC data from literature and the
   proposed equation indicate that the proposed method can be used to
   successfully predict the measured SWCC with respect to temperature.}},

Abstract = {{The reflection of a triple-shock configuration was studied numerically
   in two dimensions using the Navier-Stokes equations. The flow field was
   initialized using three shock theory, and the reflection of the triple
   point on a plane of symmetry was studied. The conditions simulated a
   stoichiometric methane-oxygen detonation cell at low pressure on time
   scales preceding ignition when the gas was assumed to be inert.
   Viscosity was found to play an important role on some shock reflection
   mechanisms believed to accelerate reaction rates in detonations when
   time scales are small. A small wall jet was present in the double Mach
   reflection and increased in size with Reynolds number, eventually
   forming a small vortex. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities were absent, and
   there was no Mach stem bifurcation at Reynolds numbers corresponding to
   when the Mach stem had travelled distances on the scale of the induction
   length. Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities are found to not likely be a
   source of rapid reactions in detonations at time scales commensurate
   with the ignition delay behind the Mach stem.}},

Abstract = {{Since the first disclosure of a patent on biphasic CO2 capture absorbent
   in 2005, more and more research work has been carried out worldwide
   looking for new biphasic systems and expanding the earlier achievements.
   There are two types of biphasic absorbent systems: amine dissolved in
   alcohol, i.e., non-aqueous system; and less soluble amines
   (alkanolamines or lipophilic amines, single amine or a mixture of
   amines) dissolved in water, i.e., aqueous system. Phase separation could
   happen at absorption temperature or at higher temperature, resulting in
   a CO2-rich phase and a CO2-lean phase. Only the CO2-rich phase will be
   regenerated, rendering a smaller regenerator and lower regeneration
   energy consumption. Some of the biphasic absorbent systems show lower
   regeneration temperatures and higher regeneration depth compared to
   aqueous MEA (monoethanolamine), indicating even more potential merits.
   In this paper, the previous R\&D results and data are summarized and
   reviewed. Future directions for research and development are discussed.

Abstract = {{This paper presents analysis on two 3D mesh to 2D map strategies applied
   to unwrap images of rock tunnels and facilitate visualization of large
   datasets. First, we examined mesh parameterization algorithms which are
   used in computer graphics to convert a 3D mesh model to a 2D
   representation.
   We found that while these methods were automatic and could provide 2D
   maps with minimal metric distortion (ie: conservation of lengths in 3D
   when mapped to 2D), they exhibited twisted shapes and were not intuitive
   to interpret. Second, we proposed two novel approaches, combining mesh
   deformation algorithms, which are used in computer animation to reshape
   a 3D mesh to resemble a 3D plane, and projection onto a 2D plane. We
   found that while these methods required user interaction and introduced
   a greater amount of metric distortion, their outputs were fairly
   intuitive to interpret. To compare the relative merits of mesh
   parameterization and mesh deformation and projection, the different
   strategies are applied to a 8.2 m wide by 41 m long by 6.7 m high
   subsection of a mining tunnel. The metric distortion produced was
   calculated and their respective output 20 maps are presented and
   discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced biofuels like dimethyl-carbonate (DMC), isobutanol and
   n-pentanol can be derived from non-food based biomass feedstock without
   unsettling food supplies and biodiversity. An experimental and
   statistical investigation was carried out to analyze the effects of
   injection-timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) on performance and
   emissions of a DI diesel engine using advanced biofuel/diesel blends
   (containing 8 wt\% oxygen). Engine characteristics were measured under
   high-load condition using moderate EGR (up to 30\%) and injection-timing
   modification (up to +/- 2 degrees CA bTDC) for controlling charge
   dilution and combustion-phasing. Multiple regression models developed
   using response surface methodology (RSM) for measured responses like
   nitrogen oxides (NOx), smoke opacity and brake specific fuel consumption
   (BSFC) were found to be statistically significant by analysis of
   variance (ANOVA). Interactive effects between injection timing and EGR
   for all blends were analyzed using response surface plots that were
   fitted using developed models. Optimization was performed using
   desirability approach of the RSM to minimize NOx and smoke emissions
   simultaneously with minimum BSFC. Isobutanol/diesel blend injected at 22
   degrees CA bTDC without EGR was predicted to be optimum for the tested
   engine. Confirmatory tests validated that the models developed using RSM
   are adequate to describe the effects of the injection timing and EGR on
   performance and emissions characteristics using all blends as the error
   in prediction is within 5\%. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   catalytic activity of Pt for AmER was investigated using electrochemical
   (cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry) and direct ammonia fuel cell

Abstract = {{Owing to its nontoxic property, low cost and narrow band gap,
   alpha-iron(III) oxide (alpha-Fe2O3) is a promising material as
   photocatalyst. However, it has shortcomings such as quick recombination
   and a short lifetime of the electron-hole pairs, which directly reduce
   the photocatalytic efficiency of alpha-Fe2O3 and hinder its wide
   applications. In this study, a facile hydrothermal method was used to
   incorporate BiOBr with alpha-Fe2O3 in an attempt to overcome the
   previously mentioned limitations of alpha-Fe2O3, and the synthesized
   composites were fully characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM), and UV-vis diffuse-reflection spectroscopy
   (DRS). The BiOBr/alpha-Fe2O3 composite showed much higher
   visible-light-driven photocatalytic activity than the pure alpha-Fe2O3
   and BiOBr for Rhodamine B (RhB) degradation. Specifically, the composite
   synthesized at 100 degrees C for 18 h with a mass ratio of BiOBr to
   alpha-Fe2O3 5:10 performed the best. This work also explored the
   chemical mechanism and pathway of RhB degradation, and the roles of the
   oxidative species with the presence of BiOBr/alpha-Fe2O3 composites in
   the photocatalytic oxidation process, including holes (h(+)), hydroxyl
   radicals ((OH)-O-center dot), and superoxide radicals (O-center
   dot(2)-). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a comprehensive model is introduced to investigate the
   influence of energy flow on the lifetime of stochastic multi-species
   prey-predator artificial ecosystems. The model consists of a non
   stationary hosting environment with food sources and a few species of
   competing herbivore and carnivore birds that can perform several
   individual and collective behaviors such as flocking, breeding,
   competing, resting, hunting, escaping, seeking, and foraging. The
   experimental results of 11,000 simulations analyzed by Cox univariate
   analysis and hazard function suggest that only a fraction of associated
   energy variables and pairwise interactions between them influence the
   lifetime. The proposed stochastic model can be utilized to simulate the
   complex multi-agent systems and their emergent behavior. Also, the
   proposed statistical analysis of energy flow to estimate the system
   stability and lifetime can be generalized to other physical and
   economical complex systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Optical systems following concepts of parity-time (PT) symmetry have
   attracted significant attention because of their extraordinary behavior
   such as unidirectional reflectance or power oscillation. PT symmetric
   optical systems are realized by judiciously manipulating the complex
   refractive index to produce even-and odd-symmetric distributions for the
   real and imaginary indices, respectively. We propose two PT symmetric
   Bragg gratings based on step-in-width metal stripes and
   dielectric-loaded metal stripes operating with long-range surface
   plasmon polaritons. The gratings are designed to operate near 880 nm
   because optical gain can be conveniently provided by IR140-doped PMMA.
   Asymmetric reflectance is predicted in the proposed gratings based on
   modal and transfer matrix method computations. Moreover, we analyzed
   pulse reshaping and energy transport in generic gratings, and in the
   proposed plasmonic gratings, in terms of group and energy velocities. It
   is found that the group and energy velocities are dispersionless at the
   PT symmetry breaking point. Also, the group velocity dispersion can be
   inverted by changing the PT symmetric state from broken to unbroken or
   vice versa. Our designs are practical because a large left-right
   asymmetric reflectance contrast is produced for a wide range of physical
   dimensions. The proposed gratings are suitable as on-chip devices for
   optical processing providing new functionality such as switching and
   controlling the time delay of a data pulse without distortion.}},

Abstract = {{In the current study, the impact of self-synthesized nanoporous titanium
   oxide (NT) on the morphology, performance and fouling of a polyamide
   (PA) thin-film composite (TFC) membrane was investigated when the
   membrane was applied for engineering osmosis (EO). The nanoporous
   structure and the spindle-like shape of NT were revealed through
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), while the AATPS modification of
   NT was verified by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
   infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy. The results of x-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and x-ray diffraction (XRD) confirmed the presence of
   modified NT (mNT) in the PA dense active layer of the TFC membrane. The
   outgrowth of the `leaf-like' structure, upon mNT loading, at the surface
   of the PA layer was observed by field-emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The TFC membrane
   prepared with 0.05 wt\% mNT loading in the organic phase showed the
   water flux of 26.41 m(-2) h(-1) when tested in the forward osmosis (FO)
   mode using 0.5M and 10 mM NaCl solution as the draw and feed solution,
   respectively. Moreover, the TFC-mNT membrane also demonstrated an
   intensified antifouling property against organic foulant during FO
   application and it was possible to retrieve the initial water flux
   almost completely with a simple water-rinsing process.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations have been used extensively for evaluating scenarios, which
   are very difficult, costly or impractical to implement in real systems.
   Testing in a synthetic, realistic environment provides a means to
   determine the viability of solutions. Simulations have proved to be very
   useful in the verification of algorithms and protocols, offering tools
   for testing them in different situations. The simulation of vehicular
   area networks pose additional challenges as realistic mobility models
   are crucial and must be incorporated in scenario elements while
   applications and communication protocols are tested. Several simulators
   and simulation frameworks have been designed that aim to synthetically
   reproduce communication and mobility of vehicles as realistically as
   possible. The majority of such simulators merge pre-existing networking
   and mobility simulators, which add issues regarding compatibility and
   realism. Such simulators present limited run-time 3D visualization
   tools, essential for providing immersive environments. Therefore, in
   this paper, we propose real-time simulation and 3D visualization for
   vehicular networks of realistic scenarios. This proposed simulation
   system generates output in real time, making use of 3D-modelled
   real-world maps and effectively generating visualization as elements are
   updated in the simulation. Experiments have been conducted with
   simulation and visualization components to evaluate delays and
   performance of the proposed simulator. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Cloud computing has evolved to provide computing resources on-demand
   through a virtualized infrastructure, letting applications, computing
   power, data storage, and network resources to be provisioned and managed
   over private networks or over the Internet. Cloud services normally run
   on large data centers and demand a huge amount of electricity.
   Consequently, the electricity cost represents one of the major concerns
   of data centers, because it is sometimes nonlinear with the capacity of
   the data centers, and it is also associated with a high amount of carbon
   emission (CO2). However, energy-saving schemes that result in too much
   degradation of the system performance or in violations of service-level
   agreement (SLA) parameters would eventually cause the users to move to
   another cloud provider. Thus, there is a need to reach a balance between
   energy savings and the costs incurred by these savings in the execution
   of the applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and evaluate a
   power and SLA-aware application consolidation solution for cloud
   federations. It comprises a multi-agent system for server consolidation,
   taking into account SLA, power consumption, and carbon footprint.
   Different for similar solutions available in the literature, in our
   solution, when a cloud is overloaded, its data center needs to negotiate
   with other data centers before migrating the workload to another cloud.
   Simulation results show that our approach can reduce up to 46\% of the
   power consumption while trying to meet performance requirements.
   Furthermore, we show that federated clouds can provide an adequate
   solution to deal with power consumption in the clouds. Copyright (C)

Abstract = {{Increasing the number of terminals in a cognitive radio network is known

   paper proposes a novel selective decision-based cooperative spectrum
   sensing strategy that limits the reporting time to a single reporting
   slot with a possibility for retransmissions using automatic repeat
   request. The terminal with the highest energy estimate sends its local
   decision to the fusion center to make a final decision. Potential
   decoding errors are mitigated using threshold-based automatic repeat

   rigorous mathematical analysis and intensive computer simulations.
   Results show observable performance enhancements compared with some

Abstract = {{With their high specific strength-to-weight ratio, carbon fiber
   reinforced composites are state of the art materials used in the

   experimental approach developed to produce metallic coated carbon fiber
   reinforced composites and demonstrates the manufacturability of such
   components. Obtainment of a low resistivity metallized composite and
   production of an easily removable metallic layer from the mold during
   lay-up molding, and preservation of the mold integrity are essential for
   the production of such materials. The results produced show that it is
   possible to produce metallized composites of various shapes that are

Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{The resilient modulus (M-R) of pavement materials is a key parameter
   required in the mechanistic pavement design methods. Seasonal moisture
   regime and suction (s) fluctuations exert remarkable influence on the
   M-R which should be measured or predicted to assist in the analysis of
   pavement distress and service life. This paper presents extensive
   experimental investigations to determine the M-R-s relationship for
   three Canadian subgrade soils (a silty clay from Toronto, a marine clay
   from Ottawa and a glacial till from Indian Head) using two different
   experimental methods. Following the first method, glacial till specimens
   were consolidated to known stress and suction levels using the
   axis-translation technique before subjecting to cyclic loading tests to
   determine the M-R. In the second method, equilibrium conditions were
   achieved with respect to different moisture contents for specimens of
   the silty clay and marine clay before cyclic loading tests. Suction was
   measured after the completion of cyclic loading tests using the filter
   paper method. Experimental results suggest varying degrees of non-linear
   relationships between the M-R and the suction, gravimetric water content
   and external stress for different soils. A simple model, which is based
   on the soil-water characteristic curve and M-R values at saturated and
   optimum moisture content conditions for prediction, is used to predict
   the measured M-R-s relationship for the three soils. Same measurements
   were also predicted using two rigorous models from the literature that
   were proposed based on different approaches. It is shown that the simple
   model, compared with other two models, provides equally good predictions
   but requires remarkably less experimental data. The simple model
   therefore can be used in practice as a reliable tool for predicting the
   influence of suction and moisture content on the resilient modulus of
   subgrade soils. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the NP-hard problem of finding a minimum size
   2-edge-connected spanning subgraph (henceforth 2EC) in cubic and
   subcubic multigraphs. We present a new 5/4-approximation algorithm for
   2EC for subcubic bridgeless multigraphs, improving upon the current best
   approximation ratio of 5/4 + epsilon. Our algorithm involves an elegant
   new method based on circulations which we feel has potential to be more
   broadly applied. We also study the closely related integrality gap
   problem, i.e. the worst case ratio between the integer linear program
   for 2EC and its linear programming relaxation, both theoretically and
   computationally. We show this gap is at most 5/4 for subcubic bridgeless
   multigraphs, and is at most 9/8 for all subcubic bridgeless graphs with
   up to 16 nodes. Moreover, we present a family of graphs that demonstrate
   the integrality gap for 2EC is at least 8/7, even when restricted to
   subcubic bridgeless graphs. This represents an improvement over the
   previous best known bound of 9/8. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A photonic true-time delay beamforming network to provide tunable
   progressive time delays for phased array beamforming is proposed and
   demonstrated. In the proposed system, a microwave signal is modulated on
   multiwavelength optical carriers and sent to an optical dispersive
   recirculating loop that contains a linearly chirped fiber Bragg grating
   (LCFBG) to provide a wavelength-dependent round trip time. As the
   microwave-modulated optical signals recirculate in the loop, the
   microwave signals carried by different wavelengths will experience
   different time delays at the output of the loop. By controlling the
   number of round trips, tunable progressive true-time delays are
   achieved, which are required for true-time delay phased array
   beamforming. The proposed true time delay beamforming network is
   experimentally evaluated. Two dispersive loops that can introduce a
   single-round-trip true-time delay difference of 2.5 ns and 160 ps are
   designed, which are implemented by using two LCFBGs with two different
   dispersion coefficients of 2500 and 200 ps/nm. The progressive time
   delays for beam steering achieved by the two dispersive loops can cover
   a beam scanning range from -60 degrees to 60 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{A computational model was developed to study the nonlinear steady state
   static response and free vibration of thin-walled carbon
   nanotubes/fiber/polymer laminated multiscale composite beams and blades.
   A set of nonlinear intrinsic equations describing the response of
   rotating cantilever composite beams undergoing large deformations was
   established. The main assumptions were small local strains and local
   rotations, large deflections and global rotations. Halpin-Tsai equations
   and fiber micromechanics were used to predict the bulk material
   properties of the multiscale nanocomposite. The carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   were assumed to be uniformly distributed and randomly oriented through
   the epoxy resin matrix. Discretized by the Galerkin approximation,
   eigenvalues and vectors and nonlinear steady state static response of
   the nanocomposite beams and blades were calculated. The volume fraction
   of fibers, weight percentage of single-walled and multi -walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs and MWCNTs) and their aspect ratio were investigated
   through a detailed parametric study for their effects on the nonlinear
   response of nanotubes-reinforced moving beams. It was found that natural
   frequencies are significantly influenced by a small percentage of CNTs.
   It was also found that the SWCNTs reinforcement produces more pronounced
   effect in comparison with MWCNTs on the nonlinear steady state static
   response and natural frequencies of the composite beams. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A broadband optically tunable microwave phase shifter with a tunable
   phase shift covering the entire 360 degrees range using three cascaded
   silicon-on-insulator (SOI) microring resonators (MRRs) that are
   optically pumped is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The phase
   tuning is implemented based on the thermal nonlinear effect in the MRRs.
   By optically pumping the MRRs, the stored light in the MRRs is absorbed
   due to two photon absorption (TPA) to generate free carriers, which
   result in free carrier absorption (FCA). The FCA effect would lead to
   the heating of the MRRs and cause a redshift in the phase response,
   which is used to implement a microwave phase shifter with a tunable
   phase shift. The device is designated and fabricated on an SOI platform,
   which is experimentally evaluated. The experimental results show that by
   optically pumping the MRRs, a broadband microwave photonic phase shifter
   with a bandwidth of 7 GHz from 16 to 23 GHz with a tunable phase shift
   covering the entire 360 degrees phase shift range is achieved. Crown

   composite wood-PET pellets. The performance of wood pellets was better
   than wood-PET pellets. Tar concentrations were lower, while, heating
   values, thermal outputs, and efficiencies tended to be higher for wood
   pellets than wood-PET pellets. The addition of secondary air above the
   fluidized bed was explored as a means of reducing the tar content of the

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{209}},
Pages = {{709-718}},

Abstract = {{In this work, a free-standing, flexible and highly conductive
   vanadium-carbon nanofiber composite has been fabricated as electrode for
   Supercapacitors. Vanadium monoxide (VO) coupled with amorphous vanadium
   covalent bonds (VOx) are successfully incorporated into carbon
   nanofibers (VO/VOx/CNF) by electrospinning and heat treatment. A
   theoretical explanation is proposed for the formation of VO/VOx in CNF
   composites. The VO and VOx are respectively reduced and formed from
   vanadium precursors of vanadium dioxide (VO2) and vanadyl (IV)
   acetylacetonate (VOA) by means of self-reduction method, in which carbon
   precursors (polyacrylonitrile and polyvinylpyrrolidone), small evolved
   gas molecules (CO, H-2, HCN) and graphitized carbon act as
   self-reductants. No additional reductants is needed before or after heat
   treatment, avoiding the secondary contamination. The VO/VOx/CNF
   electrode has a specific capacitance of 325.7 F g(-1) at a current
   density of 1 A g(-1) and is capable of reserving 92\% of its initial
   capacitance after 5000 cycles operating at a current density of 4 A
   g(-1) in a symmetric two-electrode capacitor using 6 M KOH as an
   electrolyte. The superior electrochemical performance of VO/VOx/CNF may
   be attributed to two advantages. The first is the enhanced conductivity
   brought upon the incorporation of quasi-metallic VO (similar to 10(2)
   Omega(-1)cm(-1)) and the network of nanowire, and the second is the
   rapid ion transfer rate caused by the rich vanadium redox couples VO/VOx
   and the well-developed pore structure. Notably, this work has also
   provided a facile method to obtain varaible low valence states from
   vanadium oxides through self-reduction, which may also be applied to
   synthesize other metal oxidescarbon nanofiber composites. (C) 2016

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},
Pages = {{57-64}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Appropriate control strategies for power sharing between multiple
   generation units operating in parallel are required to create a stable
   AC microgrid bus. In this paper, we explore the droop control strategy,
   implemented by power electronics units, to maintain a stable AC bus
   voltage without the need for a separate (central) communication layer.
   In particular, our suggested control method is based on adaptive fuzzy
   logic control (FLC). Fundamentally in low voltage microgrids, due to the
   effects of feeder and line impedance, the droop control method is
   subject to real and reactive power coupling and steady-state reactive
   power sharing errors, and in particular for complex microgrid
   configurations, the reactive power sharing poses certain challenges. To
   improve the reactive power sharing equalization, an enhanced FLC
   strategy has been utilized to calculate a droop coefficient for reactive
   power control. A second FLC is implemented in an integrator controller,
   where the reactive power error has been compensated through the
   injection of small real power disturbances. Root locus analysis of a
   representative microgrid with three inverters has been undertaken to
   confirm that stable solutions are feasible. Implementation of a set of
   gain values into time domain analysis demonstrates excellent voltage and
   frequency stability on the main bus, as well as equalized real and
   reactive power sharing between inverters to within +/- 5W and +/- 10
   VAR, respectively. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Insights into the ethanol electro-oxidation reaction mechanism on
   palladium in alkaline media are presented combining polarization
   modulation infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) and
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The synergy between
   PM-IRRAS and DFT calculations helps to explain why the C-C bond is not
   broken during ethanol electro-oxidation, and the reaction stops at
   acetate. Coupling chronoamperometry (CA) with in situ PM-IRRAS enables
   us to simultaneously identify ethanol electro-oxidation products on the
   catalyst surface and in the bulk solution. We show that, at lower
   potential, it is possible to break the C-C bond on Pd/C in alkaline
   media to form CO2. However, the selectivity is poor, because of
   competition with the formation of acetate and other side products, which
   gets worse at higher potentials. DFT computations complete the picture
   using the computational hydrogen electrode approach. The computations
   highlight the pivotal role of the CH3CO intermediate that can either
   undergo a C-C bond scission yielding CO and then CO2 or that can be
   oxidized toward CH3COO-. The latter is a dead end in the reaction scheme
   toward CO2 production, since it cannot be easily oxidized nor broken
   into C-i fragments. However, CH3CO is not the most favored intermediate
   formed from ethanol electro-oxidation on Pd, hence limiting the
   production of CO2.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a methodology to predict the non-linear
   stiffness-suction and shear strength-suction relationships for
   unsaturated soils within the lower suction range from the non-linearity
   of the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC), using a normalised
   function formulated with `suction times exponential degree of
   saturation'. The information required in this methodology includes (a)
   measurements of the shear strength or stiffness properties at saturation
   condition and one unsaturated condition and (b) the SWCC. Published
   experimental data on the stiffness and shear strength properties and the
   SWCC obtained from 25 different soils varying from coarse-grained sands
   to expansive clays are used to validate the proposed normalised function
   and to calibrate the exponent value. It is found that the normalised
   function, using exponent values of 1.0 and 2.0, respectively, for
   cohesionless and cohesive soils, provides reasonable predictions of the
   stiffness-suction and shear strength-suction relationships for all the
   soils used in this study, taking account of various influencing factors

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an intelligent traffic light controlling
   (ITLC) algorithm. ITLC is intended to schedule the phases of each
   isolated traffic light efficiently. This algorithm considers the
   real-time traffic characteristics of the competing traffic flows at the
   signalized road intersection. Moreover, we have adopted the ITLC
   algorithm to design a traffic scheduling algorithm for an arterial
   street scenario; we have thus proposed an arterial traffic light (ATL)
   controlling algorithm. In the ATL controlling algorithm, the intelligent
   traffic lights installed at each road intersection coordinate with each
   other to generate an efficient traffic schedule for the entire road
   network. We report on the performance of ITLC and ATL algorithms for
   several scenarios using NS-2. From the experimental results, we infer
   that the ITLC algorithm reduces, at each isolated traffic light, the
   queuing delay and increases the traffic fluency by 30\% compared with
   the online algorithm (OAF) traffic light scheduling algorithm. The
   latter algorithm achieved the best performance when compared with the
   OAF traffic light scheduling algorithm. On the other hand, the ATL
   controlling algorithm increases the traffic fluency of traveling
   vehicles at arterial street coordinations by 70\% more than the random
   and separate traffic light scheduling system. Furthermore, compared with
   the previously introduced traffic scheduling ART-SYS, the ATL
   controlling algorithm decreases the average delay at each traffic light
   by 10\%.}},

Pages = {{172-185}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{A general eigenvalue buckling solution is developed for the buckling
   analysis of sandwich pipes with thick cores subjected to internal and
   external hydrostatic pressure. The formulation accounts for shear
   deformation effects and involves two destabilizing terms: one is due to
   the external hydrostatic pressure and incorporates the follower effects,
   and the other, is due to the pre-buckling stresses undergoing the
   nonlinear components of strains. Work conjugate triplets consisting the
   Cauchy stress tensor, the Green-Lagrange strain tensor, and constant
   constitutive relations are adopted in the formulation. The principle of
   stationary potential energy is used to formulate the conditions of
   equilibrium and neutral stability conditions using polar coordinates. A
   finite difference solution is developed and implemented in MATLAB and
   then applied to predict the buckling capacity of sandwich pipes

Abstract = {{To explore the differences in carbon emissions over the whole life-cycle
   of different building structures, the published calculated carbon
   emissions from residential buildings in China and abroad were
   normalized. Embodied carbon emission flows, operations stage carbon
   emission flows, demolition and reclamation stage carbon emission flows
   and total life-cycle carbon emission flows from concrete, steel, and
   wood structures were obtained. This study is based on the theory of the
   social cost of carbon, with an adequately demonstrated social cost of
   carbon and social discount rate. Taking into consideration both static
   and dynamic situations and using a social discount rate of 3.5\%, the
   total life-cycle carbon emission flows, absolute carbon emission and
   building carbon costs were calculated and assessed. The results
   indicated that concrete structures had the highest embodied carbon
   emission flows and negative carbon emission flows in the waste and
   reclamation stage. Wood structures that started the life-cycle with
   stored carbon had the lowest carbon emission flows in the operations
   stage and relatively high negative carbon emission flows in the
   reclamation stage. Wood structures present the smallest carbon
   footprints for residential buildings.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, equations that were proposed in the literature over the
   past four decades to estimate or predict the variation of the resilient
   modulus with respect to soil suction for pavement base-course materials
   and subgrade soils are summarized into three groups: (1) empirical
   relationships, (2) constitutive models incorporating the soil suction
   into applied shearing or confining stresses, and (3) constitutive models
   extending the independent stress state variable approach. Two equations
   selected from each of the groups (a total of six equations) are used to
   predict the resilient modulus-soil suction correlations for three
   compacted subgrade soils. Strengths and limitations of these widely used
   equations are discussed based on the comparisons between the
   measurements and predictions. The key objective of the state-of-the-art
   research summarized in this paper is for assisting practicing engineers
   to choose suitable equations for the rational prediction of the
   resilient modulus taking into account the influence of the soil suction.}},

Abstract = {{The fracture process of commercially pure titanium was visualized in
   model materials containing artificial holes. These model materials were
   fabricated using a femtosecond laser coupled with a diffusion bonding
   technique to obtain voids in the interior of titanium samples. Changes
   in void dimensions during in-situ straining were recorded in three
   dimensions using x-ray computed tomography. Void growth obtained
   experimentally was compared with the Rice and Tracey model which
   predicted well the average void growth. A large scatter in void growth
   data was explained by differences in grain orientation which was
   confirmed by crystal plasticity simulations. It was also shown that
   grain orientation has a stronger effect on void growth than intervoid
   spacing and material strength. Intervoid spacing, however, appears to
   control whether the intervoid ligament failure is ductile or brittle.

Abstract = {{Lac, a natural resin, is used to synthesize gold nanoparticles (AuNPs).
   This biodegradable natural fluorophore contains different laccaic acids,
   which consist of mainly the derivatives of red anthraquinone dye. For
   the first time, we report an in situ green synthesis of fluorophore
   stabilized AuNPs. The synthesis of AuNPs is monitored using both
   excitation and emission spectrophotometry, which gives us an idea about
   the progress of the reaction during nanoparticles synthesis. The size of
   the synthesized nanoparticles is visualised by TEM. The TEM data of the
   AuNPs are also correlated using DLS measurements, and the zeta potential
   values establish the stability of the nanoparticles. The FTIR spectra
   indicate the different groups present in lac and also their probable
   interactions during the reducing cum -stabilizing process with the
   nanoparticles. The AuNPs are crystalline in nature, which is established
   by XRD analysis The lac extract also binds with calf thymus DNA and
   forms a ground state complex, which is established
   spectrophotometrically by UV-Vis, as well as fluorimetrically. The
   antimicrobial tests against bacteria and the antitoxicity study have
   revealed that the lac stabilized AuNPs are safe and non-toxic, having
   the potential for clinical applications in the medical field.}},

Abstract = {{The one-dimensional (1-D) potential heave (or swell strain) of expansive
   soil is conventionally estimated using the swelling pressure and
   swelling index values that are determined from different types of
   oedometer test results. The swelling pressure of expansive soils is
   typically measured at saturated condition from oedometer tests. The
   experimental procedures of oedometer tests are cumbersome as well as
   time-consuming for use in conventional geotechnical engineering practice
   and are not capable of estimating heave under different stages of
   unsaturated conditions. To alleviate these limitations, semi-empirical
   models are proposed to predict the variation of swelling pressure of
   both compacted and natural expansive soils with respect to soil suction
   using the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) as a tool. An empirical
   relationship is also suggested for estimating the swelling index from
   plasticity index values, alleviating the need for conducting oedometer
   tests. The predicted swelling pressure and estimated swelling index are
   then used to estimate the variation of 1-D heave with respect to suction
   for expansive soils by modifying Fredlund's 1983 equation. The proposed
   approach is validated for eight field sites from six countries-namely,
   Saudi Arabia, Australia, Canada, China, USA, and UK-and on six different
   compacted expansive soils from USA.}},

Abstract = {{The soil heave over time associated with a leak in a hot-water line
   beneath a floor slab of a lightly loaded structure constructed on a
   natural unsaturated expansive soil in Regina of Saskatchewan, Canada is
   modelled in this paper using the Modulus of Elasticity Based Method

   the Prairie Regional Station of the Division of Building Research,
   National Research Council in 1960s as a part of a comprehensive field
   study program to investigate the problems associated with construction
   in/on an expansive soil in the Regina area. There is a good comparison
   between the results from the MEBM and the published data of measurements
   and estimations of soil heave over time. The encouraging results of this
   study suggest that the MEBM is a simple and promising approach for use
   in conventional engineering practice by geotechnical engineers for
   estimation of the heave over time of expansive soils.}},

Abstract = {{The diffusion of heat injected from a line source into turbulence
   generated by regular and fractal grids with the same solidity and inlet
   velocity was investigated experimentally with particular interest in the
   effects of grid geometry and relative location of the source on the
   width of the thermal plume and the mixing efficiency. These grids
   included one fractal square grid (FSG) and three regular square grids
   with mesh sizes that were comparable to the first (RG160), second (RG80)
   and fourth (RG18) iterations of the fractal grid. The heated line source
   was inserted on the centre plane of the grids, spanning the entire width
   of the wind tunnel at either of two downstream locations, an upstream
   location or a location nearly coincident with a grid. It was found that,
   in all cases examined, RG160 produced the strongest diffusion of the
   thermal plume and the highest level of scalar mixing. These observations
   were consistent with the evolution of the corresponding turbulent
   diffusivities, which, according to Taylor's theory of diffusion, are the
   product of the transverse turbulence intensity and the integral length
   scale. We argue that to maximise scalar diffusion and mixing of a scalar
   released from a concentrated source inside a duct, one should prefer a
   regular grid over a fractal square grid; we also recommend the use of a
   grid with a mesh size roughly equal to half the height of the duct and
   placed at approximately one duct height upstream of the source.}},

Abstract = {{Surface modifying macromolecules (SMMs) were synthesized with various
   polyurethane pre polymers end-capped with different groups and blended
   into the casting solution of cellulose acetate (CA) to prepare surface
   modified ultra-filtration (UF) membranes for water filtration
   applications. The surface modification of the CA membranes was confirmed
   by the FTIR and static contact angle (SCA) measurements. The membranes
   so prepared had the typical characteristics of UF membranes as confirmed
   by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Membrane properties were studied
   in terms of membrane compaction, percentage water content (\%WC), pure
   water flux (PWF), membrane hydraulic resistance (R-m), molecular weight
   cut-off (MWCO), average pore size and porosity. The result showed that
   PWF, \%WC, MWCO and pore size increased whereas the R-m decreased by the
   addition of SMMs. The significant effect of SMMs on the fouling by humic
   acid (HA) was also observed. It was found that the cSMM-3 membrane, in
   which SMM was synthesized with diethylene glycol (DEG) and hydroxyl
   benzene sulfonate (HBS) was blended, had the highest flux recovery ratio
   FRR (84.6\%), as well as the lowest irreversible fouling (15.4\%),
   confirming their improved antifouling properties. Thus, the SMM modified
   CA membranes had proven, to play an important role in the water
   treatment by UF. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Complex signal analysis for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis via shift
   invariant dictionary learning}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Planetary gearbox vibration signals are intricate due to the unique
   structure, complex kinetics and background noise interference. Moreover,
   they have time shift invariant feature because of the periodical
   rotation of the mechanical components. Reliable feature extraction from
   such signals is the key to success in planetary gearbox fault diagnosis.
   The recently proposed shift invariant K-means singular value
   decomposition (SI-K-SVD) dictionary learning method offers a good
   approach to analyze such signals. This method requires neither a priori
   knowledge on signals to construct any analytic dictionary, nor a large
   number of sample signals to form a training dictionary. It is therefore
   data-driven in nature, and highly flexible and adaptive to represent
   signals. In this paper, such properties of the SI-K-SVD are exploited to
   extract the latent constituent components of complex signals and use
   them to represent signals sparsely, thus suppressing background noise
   and revealing the true vibration patterns. To apply the SI-K-SVD method
   to planetary gearbox signals, the criteria for determining the key
   parameters used in the SI-K-SVD, i.e., the length of pattern and number
   of decompositions, are suggested. The method has been illustrated by
   analyzing numerically simulated signals. It has been favorably compared
   with the frequently used matching pursuit (MP) and K-means singular
   value decomposition (K-SVD) methods. Its effectiveness in real planetary
   gearbox fault diagnosis has been validated by analysis of lab
   experimental signals of a planetary gearbox. The results show that both
   localized and distributed gear faults can be diagnosed successfully. (C)

Abstract = {{Two hybrid photooxidation systems consisting of two different reactors;
   photocatalytic reactor-ultrafiltration (PR-UF) and photocatalytic
   membrane reactor (PMR) have been investigated and compared for
   photolysis and separation of oily water. In both, oily water was
   irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light. In PR, UV irradiation was made on
   the TiO2 photocatalyst suspended in oily water, followed by
   ultrafiltration (UF) to remove TiO2 particles and hydrocarbon residues.
   On the other hand, TiO2 was immobilized on the halloysite nanotube (HNT)
   and embedded in the UF membrane in PMR. In both systems, hydrocarbon
   concentration, chemical oxygen demand (COD), total dissolved solid
   (TDS), and hydrocarbon concentration were measured at each step of
   photooxydation and filtration. In UF, membrane flux, reduction in solute
   concentration, flux decline and flux recovery by backwashing were
   investigated. The experimental results showed that the reduction in TOC
   by PR-UF was similar to 10\% higher than PMR. On the other hand,
   reduction in hydrocarbon concentration, COD and TDS was higher for PMR.
   The TiO2 concentration in UF permeate was 8 ppm and 0.2 ppm,

Abstract = {{Novel methodology for facilely fabricating nanofiltration (NF) composite
   membrane has been successfully developed by employing nucleophilic
   nature of polydopamine (PDA) chemistry. The self-polymerized PDA coating
   over polysulfone (PSf) substrate was utilized as a key intermediate
   layer for trimesoyl chloride (TMC) grafting followed by
   poly(ethyleneimine) (PEI) deposition to construct the hierarchically
   structured separation layer of NF membrane. In contrast to the
   electrophilic quinone moieties of PDA layer usually involved in the
   Michael addition and Schiff base reactions with polymeric amines for
   membrane preparation in previous reports, the phenolic hydroxyl groups
   of catechol moieties as well as amine groups at the PDA layer possess
   nucleophilic nature, which are capable of quickly coupling with the
   highly reactive acyl chlorides to form ester and amide bonds in the step
   of TMC grafting, resulting in TMC moieties covalently anchored at the
   PDA layer with free acyl chloride groups. Such created acyl chlorides
   are further coupled with the amine groups of branched PEI polymer in the
   PEI deposition procedure to form the stable amide bonds linking the PDA
   base layer and PEI upper layer in the resulting hierarchical separation
   layer. The properties of membranes prepared at different stages were
   characterized with respect to surface chemistry, pore properties, and
   separation performances to understand deeply the newly developed
   methodology for membrane preparation. Further studies focusing on NF
   properties and stability of the developed NF membrane revealed that such
   membrane shows high efficiencies in retention of divalent cations, small
   organic molecules as well as heavy metal ions, and exhibits desirable
   thermal stability and long-term performance stability. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   accuracy for membranes with non-linear isotherms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{511}},
Pages = {{119-129}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{The time-lag method based on downstream measurements is one of the most
   popular methods for gas membrane characterization. This method is
   commonly used to characterize all types of membranes, either glassy or
   rubbery, and regardless of the type of isotherm for a gas
   molecule/membrane system. The time-lag method has originally been
   derived for a linear isotherm system (Henry's relation) under the
   assumption of vacuum at the downstream side of the membrane. This
   zero-pressure assumption is obviously violated as a finite downstream
   volume is required to record a pressure change necessary to estimate the
   time lag. The objective of this investigation is therefore to critically
   assess the degree of validity of the downstream time-lag method under
   more realistic boundary conditions and for systems characterized with
   nonlinear isotherms such as dual-mode sorption. To achieve this
   objective, the mass diffusion equation was solved numerically by finite
   differences and numerical results were compared with known analytical
   solutions. This study provides a deeper understanding on the behavior of
   adsorption and the transport of molecules inside a membrane for the
   cases of linear isotherm and dual mode sorption with complete
   immobilization and instantaneous equilibrium. Results clearly show that
   the sorption parameters have a major impact on the time required to
   achieve steady state as well as on the transient behavior before
   reaching steady state under ideal boundary conditions. Under the
   realistic boundary conditions, steady state can never be achieved and
   can only be approached due to gas accumulation in the downstream
   compartment. Conditions under which higher accuracy is obtained in the
   determination of the diffusion coefficient are discussed. (C) 2016

Title = {{Joint envelope and frequency order spectrum analysis based on iterative
   generalized demodulation for planetary gearbox fault diagnosis under
   nonstationary conditions}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76-77}},

Abstract = {{Planetary gearbox vibration signals under nonstationary conditions are
   characterized by time-varying nature and complex multi-components,
   making it very difficult to extract features for fault diagnosis. Order
   spectrum analysis is one of the effective approaches for nonstationary
   signal analysis of rotating machinery. The main idea of order analysis
   is to map the time-varying frequency components into constant ones.
   Inspired by this idea, we propose a new order spectrum analysis method
   to exploit the unique property of iterative generalized demodulation in
   converting arbitrary instantaneous frequency trajectories of
   multi-component signals into constant frequency lines on the
   time-frequency plane. This new method is completely algorithm-based and
   tachometer/encoder-free, thus easy to implement. It does not involve
   equi-angular resampling commonly required by most order tracking methods
   and is hence free from the decimation and/or interpolation error. The
   proposed order analysis method can eliminate the time-variation effect
   of frequency and thus can effectively reveal the harmonic order
   constituents of nonstationary multi component signals. However, the
   planetary gearbox vibration signals also lead to complex sideband
   orders. As such, we further propose to analyze the order spectrum of
   amplitude envelope. This will eliminate the complex sideband orders in
   the order spectrum of original signals, leading to a substantially
   simplified and more reliable gear characteristic frequency
   identification process. Nevertheless, the gear and/or planet carrier
   rotating frequency orders, which are irrelevant to gear fault, may still
   exist. To avoid possible misleading results due to such frequency
   orders, we also propose to analyze the order spectrum of instantaneous
   frequency. Theoretically, the peaks present in frequency order spectrum
   directly correspond to the gear characteristic frequency orders, which
   can be used to extract gear fault signature more explicitly. The
   proposed method has been illustrated via analysis of the simulated
   signals of planetary gearboxes, and validated using lab experimental
   planetary gearbox datasets, both under variable speed conditions. The
   analysis results have shown that the method is effective in extracting
   both distributed and localized gear faults under nonstationary
   conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A wavelength tunable optical buffer with the ability to achieve data
   recovery based on self-pulsation in an active microring resonator is
   proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The key component in the
   optical buffer is the microring resonator which is implemented based on
   an InP-InGaAsP material system incorporating two semiconductor optical
   amplifiers and a phase modulator, ensuring an ultrahigh Q-factor and a
   tunable resonance wavelength for fast self-pulsation operating at
   gigahertz frequencies. An optical carrier modulated by an arbitrary
   pulse sequence is used to trigger the self-pulsation in the microring
   resonator, while its output is coupled to a fiber-optic delay line in an
   optoelectronic delayed feedback configuration, a recursive system for
   data storage. Optical buffering and data recovery at 1 Gb/s are
   experimentally demonstrated, which is the fastest optical buffer ever
   reported based on self-pulsation in a microring resonator. The proposed
   optical buffer can be employed to perform critical telecommunication
   buffer functions including writing, storage, reshaping, healing, and
   erasing.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible bidirectional shape memory is developed in thermoplastic
   polyurethane by designing different components to enable molecular
   switching from actuator domain to self-assembled rigid hard domain and
   vice versa under a temperature cycle. Polycaprolactone based special
   polyurethanes have been synthesized which exhibit appropriate
   self-assembly behavior suitable for the shape memory effect. Reversible
   bidirectional shape memory has been reported through induced strain and
   giving shape at particular temperature, and the results are compared
   with conventional polyurethanes which do not show any shape memory
   effect. The correlation between chemical structures, self-assembly,
   structural evolution, and shape memory effect has been made.
   Self-gripping is demonstrated revealing the novel mechanism of molecular

Abstract = {{Web Real-Time Communication (WebRTC), drafted by the World Wide Web
   Consortium (W3C) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), enables
   direct browser-to-browser real-time communication. As its congestion
   control mechanism, WebRTC uses the Google Congestion Control (GCC)
   algorithm. But using GCC will limit WebRTC's performance in cases of
   overusing due to using a fixed decreasing factor, known as alpha
   (alpha). In this paper, the authors propose a dynamic alpha model to
   reduce the receiving bandwidth estimate during overuse as indicated by
   the overuse detector. Using their proposed model, the receiver can more
   efficiently estimate its receiving rate in case of overuse. They
   implemented their model over both unconstrained and constrained
   networks. Experimental results show noticeable improvements in terms of
   higher incoming rate, lower Round-Trip Time, and lower packet loss
   compared to the fixed alpha model.}},

Abstract = {{Intermediate band (IB) materials are promising candidates for realizing
   high efficiency solar cells. In IB photovoltaics, photons are absorbed
   in one of three possible electronic transitions-valence to conduction
   band, valence to intermediate band, or intermediate to conduction band.
   With fully concentrated sunlight, when the band gaps have been chosen
   appropriately, the highest efficiency IB solar cells require that these
   three absorptions be non-overlapping, so absorbed photons of fixed
   energy contribute to only one transition. The realistic case of
   overlapping absorptions, where the transitions compete for photons, is
   generally considered to be a source of loss. We show that overlapping
   absorptions can in fact lead to significant improvements in IB solar
   cell efficiencies, especially for IB that are near the middle of the
   band gap. At low to moderate concentration, the highest efficiency
   requires overlapping absorptions. We use the detailed-balance method and
   indicate how much overlap of the absorptions is required to achieve
   efficiency improvements, comparing with some known cases. These results
   substantially broaden the set of materials that can be suitable for
   high-efficiency IB solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{A significant number of promising applications for vehicular ad hoc
   networks (VANETs) are becoming a reality. Most of these applications
   require a variety of heterogenous content to be delivered to vehicles

   such dynamic and large-scale networks is easier said than done. In this

   applied to VANETs while highlighting their new characteristics and
   describing their underlying architectural design. First, the two
   fundamental building blocks that are part of an entire content delivery
   system are identified: replica allocation and content delivery. The
   related solutions are then classified according to their architectural
   definition. Within each category, solutions are described based on the
   techniques and strategies that have been adopted. As result, we present
   an in-depth discussion on the architecture, techniques, and strategies
   adopted by studies in the literature that tackle problems related to

Abstract = {{A general formula, for the capacity of arbitrary compound channels with
   the receiver channel state information, is obtained using the
   information density approach. No assumptions of ergodicity,
   stationarity, or information stability are made and the channel state
   set is arbitrary. A direct (constructive) proof is given. To prove
   achievability, we generalize Feinstein Lemma to the compound channel
   setting, and to prove converse, we generalize Verdu-Han Lemma to the
   same compound setting. A notion of a uniform compound channel is
   introduced and the general formula is shown to reduce to the familiar
   sup-inf expression for such channels. As a by-product, the arbitrary
   varying channel capacity is established under maximum error probability
   and deterministic coding. Conditions are established under which the
   worst-case and compound channel capacities are equal, so that the full
   channel state information at the transmitter brings in no advantage. The
   compound inf-information rate plays a prominent role in the general
   formula. Its properties are studied and a link between the
   information-unstable and information-stable regimes of a compound
   channel is established. The results are extended to include e-capacity
   of compound channels. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the strong
   converse to hold are given.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recently, synthetic optical materials represented via non-Hermitian
   Hamiltonians have attracted significant attention because of their
   nonorthogonal eigensystems, enabling unidirectionality, nonreciprocity
   and unconventional beam dynamics. Such systems demand carefully
   configured complex optical potentials to create skewed vector spaces
   with a desired metric distortion. In this paper, we report optically
   generated non-Hermitian photonic lattices with versatile control of real
   and imaginary sub-lattices. In the proposed method, such lattices are
   generated by vector-field holographic interference of two elliptically
   polarized pump beams on azobenzene-doped polymer thin films. We
   experimentally observe violation of Friedel's law of diffraction,
   indicating the onset of complex lattice formation. We further create an
   exact parity-time symmetric lattice to demonstrate totally asymmetric
   diffraction at the spontaneous symmetry-breaking threshold, referred to
   as an exceptional point. On this basis, we provide the experimental
   demonstration of reconfigurable non-Hermitian photonic lattices in the
   optical domain and observe the purest exceptional point ever reported to
   date.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic routing (OR) is a promising paradigm that has been
   proposed for wireless mesh networks. This routing paradigm takes
   advantage of the broadcast nature of the wireless medium to increase the
   reliability of transmissions in multihop wireless networks. The
   selection of a set of candidates involves satisfying the basic
   requirements of the model, in which packets are forwarded toward the
   destination. In OR, if one of the selected candidates does not receive
   the packet, another candidate might be able to continue forwarding the
   packet. The decision of which forwarder to choose is made by
   coordination between candidates that have successfully received the
   transmitted packet. In this paper, we propose a discrete-time Markov
   chain as a general model for OR and demonstrate how it can be used to
   evaluate the performance of OR protocols. We also review three
   well-known OR protocols that we have selected as a study case. Our study
   demonstrates how our model facilitates better understanding of the
   combination of a number of candidates and retransmissions and their
   significant contributions to the successful delivery of data packets.
   Thus, this shows that our model can help in the design of future OR
   protocols and efficient candidate selection algorithms.}},

Title = {{Experimental Evaluation of Engineering Properties of GFRP Screw Anchors
   for Anchoring Applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS IN CIVIL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Steel screw anchors (SSAs) have been widely used in geotechnical
   engineering practice because they are simple in structure and easy to
   design and construct. The main disadvantage of SSAs is that they rust
   quickly and are not found to be suitable for permanent structures,
   unless adequate corrosion protection measures are provided. Anchors made
   of glass fiber-reinforced plastic (GFRP) are corrosion-resistant
   material that are light in weight with a higher tensile resistance in
   comparison with SSAs. For this reason, GFRP anchors have been found to
   be a good substitute for SSAs during the last two decades. In this
   paper, details of a newly developed GFRP screw anchor (GFRP-SA) with
   respect to the physicomechanical, tensile, and creep properties along
   with its performance both in the laboratory and in field conditions are
   provided. A specially developed machine that facilitates quick
   installation of the GFRP-SA is also briefly introduced. In addition, two
   full-scale field tests that were undertaken to study in situ long-term
   performance of the GFRP-SAs for anchoring soil slopes (1)in an expansive
   soil, and (2)in a compacted subgrade soil are presented and discussed.
   Furthermore, the average pullout resistances of the GFRP-SAs were also
   determined from field tests. The results of the field studies suggest
   that GFRP-SAs can be installed with relative ease and they provide
   adequate resistance against shallow landslide slope failures. The study
   presented in this paper is encouraging for the use of GFRP-SAs in
   conventional geotechnical engineering practice for stabilizing slopes in
   different types of soils.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer measurements in a three-rod bundle equipped with wire-wrap
   and grid spacers were obtained at supercritical pressures in the
   Supercritical University of Ottawa Loop (SCUOL). The tests were
   performed using carbon dioxide, as a surrogate fluid for water, flowing
   up wards for wide ranges of conditions, including conditions equivalent
   to the nominal and near-normal operating conditions of the proposed
   Canadian Super-Critical Water-Cooled Reactor. The test section contained
   three heated rods and three unheated rod segments with an outer diameter
   of 10 mm and a pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1.14; the heated length was
   1500 mm. Detailed surface temperature measurements along and around the
   three heated rods were collected using internally traversed
   thermocouples. The following ranges of test conditions were covered,
   with equivalent water conditions given inside parentheses: pressure from
   6.6 to 8.36 MPa (19.7-25 MPa); inlet temperature from 11 to 30 degrees C
   (330-371 degrees C); mass flux from 200 to 1175 kg m(-2) s(-1) (340-1822
   kg m(-2) s(-1)); and wall heat flux from 1 to 175 kW m(-2) (11-1847 kW
   m(-2)). For one set of tests, the heated rods were fitted with a 1.3 mm
   OD wire wrap, having an axial pitch of 200 mm along the entire heated
   length; for a second set, the heated rods were fitted with grid spacers
   having a 5.3\% flow blockage and located at 500 mm axial intervals. The
   effects of spacer configuration on heat transfer at supercritical
   pressures were documented and analyzed. The observed experimental trends
   were compared to those obtained in a experiment in a heated tube at
   similar conditions and with predictions of a supercritical heat transfer
   correlation. Heat transfer was observed to deteriorate near the start of
   the heated section of the rod bundle equipped with either type of
   spacers as well as in a circulartube for mass fluxes between 200 and 700
   kg m(-2) s(-1). The onset of deterioration occurred at a higher heat
   flux for the wire-wrapped bundle than for the one with grid spacers, and
   at the lowest heat flux for the tube. Normal heat transfer in either of
   the rod bundles behaved similarly to the one in the tube and was also
   compatible with the predictions of the correlation of Jackson. The grid
   spacers introduced a strong local enhancement, but their effects
   disappeared only about 10 rod diameters downstream. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Higher alcohols are attractive next generation biofuels that can be
   extracted from sugary, starchy and ligno-cellulosic biomass feedstocks
   using sustainable pathways. Their viability for use in diesel engines
   has greatly improved ever since extended bio-synthetic pathways have
   achieved substantial yields of these alcohols using engineered
   micro-organisms. This study sets out to compare and analyze the effects
   of some higher alcohol/diesel blends on combustion and emission
   characteristics of a direct injection diesel engine. Four test fuels
   containing 30\% by vol. of iso-butanol, n-pentanol, n-hexanol and
   n-octanol (designated as ISB30, PEN30, HEX30 and OCT30 respectively) in
   ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD) were used. Results indicated that ISB30
   experienced longest ignition delay and produced highest peaks of
   pressure and heat release rates (HRR) compared to other higher-alcohol
   blends. The ignition delay, peak pressure and peak HRR are found to be
   in the order of (from highest to lowest): ISB30 > PEN30 > HEX30 > OCT30
   > ULSD. The combustion duration (CD) for all test fuels is in the
   sequence (from shortest to longest): ISB30 < PEN30 < HEX30 < OCT30 <
   ULSD. Experimental mass fraction burned profiles fitted using the
   Wiebe's function revealed that the burning rate at the start of
   combustion is rapid for ISB30 followed by PEN30, HEX30, OCT30 and ULSD.
   From the emissions standpoint, NOx emissions decreased for all blends at
   low/medium loads but increased for PEN30 and HEX30 at high engine loads
   only. Smoke opacity is low for all blends due to their oxygenated nature
   and was of the order (from highest to lowest): ULSD > OCT30 > HEX30 >
   PEN30 > ISB30. HC emissions are high for ISB30 and PEN30 while it
   decreased favorably for HEX30 and OCT30. It was of the order (from
   highest to lowest): ISB30 > PEN30 > ULSD > HEX30 > OCT30. CO emissions
   of the blends followed the trend of smoke emissions and remained lower
   than ULSD with the following order (from highest to lowest): ULSD >
   OCT30 > HEX30 > PEN30 > ISB30. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An optoelectronic oscillator (OEO) for high sensitivity temperature
   sensing is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The oscillation
   frequency of the OEO is determined by a single passband microwave
   photonic filter (MPF) in the OEO loop, which is implemented using a
   broadband light source, a Mach-Zehnder interferometer (MZI), a
   dispersion compensating fiber, and a photodetector. One arm of the MZI
   is used as a sensing arm, which is exposed to temperature variations and
   the other arm is used as a reference arm. When the temperature is
   changed, the length difference between the two arms is changed, which
   leads to the change of the free spectral range of the MZI. Since the
   central frequency of the MPF is a function of the FSR, the oscillation
   frequency of the OEO is affected by the temperature variations. By
   measuring the frequency change, the temperature change to the sensing
   arm is estimated. The proposed approach is experimentally evaluated.
   High sensitivity temperature sensing with a sensitivity of 3.7
   MHz/degrees C is experimentally demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this work is the characterization of the thermal and
   hydraulic performance of pin fin arrays produced using the cold spray
   additive manufacturing process. The heat transfer and the pressure
   losses of 1 mm high round base, square base and diamond base tapered pin
   fin arrays were assessed in both the inline and staggered configurations
   for fin densities of 8 fpi and 12 fpi. These performances were
   correlated to the turbulence intensity and the turbulent kinetic energy
   values at various locations in the flow, measured by micro-particle
   image velocimetry. It was inferred that the form drag is the main
   contributor to the pressure loss and was found to correlate with the
   flow turbulent kinetic energy in the fin wake. In contrast, the
   convective heat transfer coefficient correlated better with the
   turbulence intensity, leading to the conclusion that heat transfer is
   not dictated solely by the turbulent kinetic energy, but by the relative
   strength of the velocity fluctuations with respect to the average flow
   velocity at the same location. Furthermore, the flow structures for the
   different fin array samples were visualized and are discussed. Finally,
   it was found that although the samples had very varied thermal and
   hydrodynamic performances as a function of Reynolds number, the
   different samples at a given fin density had similar thermal
   conductances at a given pumping power. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{An environmentally friendly method has been applied for the preparation
   of reduced graphene oxide (RGO). This method was developed by using
   polyphenols that contained a phyto extract of Mangifera indica L. along
   with Solanum tuberosum L. as reducing agents since they are non-toxic
   and naturally available. The phytoextracts used in the production of RGO
   was set between 60 and 70 degrees C. Graphene oxide (GO) was prepared by
   modified Hummer's method as reported in earlier findings. Structural and
   morphological studies demonstrate that the part of the oxygen
   functionalities in GO can be removed by following green reduction.
   Characterizations of the resulting product have been done by X-ray
   diffraction, FTIR, UV-vis and Raman spectroscopy. FESEM, TEM, EDX
   spectrum, TGA, DLS and Zeta potential measurements of the samples have
   also been carried out to study the morphological, thermal and surface

Abstract = {{A microwave photonic link (MPL) with simultaneous suppression of the
   even-order and third-order distortions using a polarization modulator
   (PolM), an optical bandpass filter (OBPF), and a balanced photodetector
   (BPD) is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. The even-order
   distortions are suppressed by utilizing orthogonal polarization
   modulation based on the PolM and balanced differential detection based
   on the BPD. The third-order distortions (IMD3) are suppressed by
   optimizing the spectral response of the OBPF with an optimal power ratio
   between the optical carrier and the sidebands of the phase-modulated
   signals from the PolM. Since the suppression of the IMD3 is achieved
   when the MPL is optimized for even-order distortion suppression, the
   proposed MPL can operate with simultaneous suppression of the even-order
   and third-order distortions. The proposed MPL is analyzed theoretically
   and is verified by an experiment. For a two-tone RF signal of f(1) = 10
   GHz and f(2) = 19.95 GHz, the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR2) is
   enhanced by 23.4 dB for the second harmonic (2f(1)), and 29.1 and 27.6
   dB for the second intermodulation (f(2)-f(1) and f(1) + f(2)), as
   compared with a conventional MPL. For a two-tone RF signal of f(1) =
   9.95 GHz and f(2) = 10 GHz, the SFDR3 is increased by 13.1 dB as
   compared with a conventional MPL. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{A novel hydrophobic membrane-based desiccant fiber (MDF) was developed
   by loading lithium chloride into hydrophobic hollow fiber membranes. The
   MDF thus made was then tested for vapor absorption under controlled
   conditions. Furthermore, an MDF pad, which was made by weaving MDF into
   a piece of garment, was built into a laboratory vacuum desiccant cooling
   (VDC) setup, which included the MDF pad as the desiccant layer and a
   cooling towel saturated with water as the water reservoir, to test the
   cooling effects at atmospheric pressure and vacuum of 25 in. of Hg.
   Results indicate that MDF is suitable for applications such as in VDC.
   Mass and heat transfer of vapor absorption by MDF were also analyzed.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{96-108}},
Month = {{JUN 19}},
Abstract = {{A Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) reader network is as a
   collaboration of RFID readers that aim to cover (i.e., identify,
   monitor, and track) every RFID tag in a given area. The RFID coverage
   (RFC) problem is defined as follows. Given a reader network, assign to
   each tag t a specific reader v in its proximity such that v is
   responsible for covering t (called its owner), while minimizing the
   number of owner readers. The problem has applications in energy
   conservation and in eliminating readers and data redundancy from the
   reader networks. We introduce a number of decentralized algorithms for
   the RFID coverage problem: 1) algorithms RANDOM, RANDOM(+), and MAX MIN
   which are randomized algorithms that run in 0(1) write/read rounds, 2)
   algorithm GDE which is an efficient decentralized implementation of the
   greedy set cover algorithm, and 3) an improvement of GDE which is
   called. Our algorithms assume that the RFID tags are writeable, where a
   writeable tag is a passive RFID tag with writeable memory. We show using
   simulation experiments that our algorithms outperform major RFID
   coverage algorithms in various scenarios with respect to a number of
   performance metrics. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of a sustainable biofuel - n-octanol - on the combustion,

Abstract = {{Higher alcohols above n-butanol can be excellent alternative fuels for
   diesel engines owing to their high energy content and high cetane
   number. The last three years has witnessed an advent of several
   sustainable pathways for n-octanol bio-synthesis using
   engineered-microbes like Escherichia coli and Clostridium species.
   Therefore an investigation to evaluate the compatibility of n-octanol in
   diesel engines becomes essential. The influence of blending n-octanol by
   up to 30 vol\% with fossil diesel on combustion, performance and
   emission characteristics of a single cylinder direct-injection (DI)
   diesel engine under both naturally aspirated and exhaust gas
   recirculation (EGR) modes was investigated with reference to diesel.
   Results showed that n-octanol prolonged the ignition delay generating
   higher peaks of in-cylinder pressure and heat release rates (HRR) during
   the pre-mixed combustion phase. Brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increased
   while brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) decreased with an increase
   in n-octanol fraction. Smoke, NOx (nitrogen oxides), HC (hydro-carbons)
   and CO (carbon monoxide) emissions decreased with n-octanol addition.
   NOx and smoke emissions also remained low at all EGR rates. Both BTE and
   BSFC suffered at increased EGR rates. HC and CO emissions increased with
   escalating EGR rates. n-Octanol was found to be very promising for
   replacing fossil-diesel by up to 30\% (subject to long term durability
   tests), in terms of emissions and performance at both naturally
   aspirated and EGR conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   works based on solving the muscle redundancy problem forward in time

   exemplify, here in this study it is wrapped around OpenSim and the
   optimization is done in MAMAS. The novel simulation framework was highly
   robust for repeated runs and produced relatively high correlations

Abstract = {{Although the use of blasting has become a routine in contemporary mine
   operations, there is a lack of knowledge on the response of cement
   tailings backfills subjected to sudden dynamic loading. To rationally
   describe such a phenomenon, a new coupled chemo-viscoplastic cap model
   is proposed in the present study to describe the behavior of hydrating
   cemented tailings backfill under blast loading. A modified Perzyna type
   of visco-plasticity model is adopted to represent the rate-dependent
   behavior of the cemented tailings backfill under blast loading. A
   modified smooth surface cap model is consequently developed to
   characterize the yield of the material, which also facilitates
   hysteresis and full compaction as well as dilation control. Then, the
   viscoplastic formulation is further augmented with a variable bulk
   modulus derived from a Mie-Gruneisen equation of state, in order to
   capture the nonlinear hydrostatic response of cemented backfills
   subjected to high pressure. Subsequently, the material properties
   required in the viscoplastic cap model are coupled with a chemical
   model, which captures and quantifies the degree of cement hydration.
   Thus, the behavior of hydrating cemented backfills under the impact of
   blast loading can be evaluated under any curing time of interest. The
   validation results of the developed model show a good agreement between
   the experimental and the predicted results. The authors believe that the
   proposed model will contribute to a better understanding of the
   performance of cemented backfills under mine blasting and contribute to
   evaluating and managing the risk of failure of backfill structures under
   such a dynamic condition. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Pt/CeO2, Ru/CeO2, Ir/CeO2 and the corresponding unsupported
   nanoparticles (Pt, Ru and Ir) were evaluated for their performance in
   the complete oxidation of ethylene in the presence and absence of
   oxygen. The lattice oxygen and oxygen storage capacity (OSC) of CeO2 had
   a significant influence on the interaction with the supported metal
   nanoparticles, which caused different catalytic behaviours in the
   absence of oxygen. Overall, Ru/CeO2 was more stable than Ir/CeO2 and
   Pt/CeO2, which results in transient promotional rate enhancement ratio
   (rho(MSI); MSI=metal-support interaction) values that reach 200 in the
   first 25 min. These results were attributed to the corresponding
   interaction with CeO2 and negligible carbon deposition. A proposed
   relationship between rho(MSI) and the O2- consumed from CeO2 is
   discussed, which was suggested as a possible tool to estimate the extent
   of the MSI. In general, an increase in rho(MSI) corresponded to an
   increase in O2- consumed from ceria.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of Chemical Looping Combustion (CLC) with Calcium
   Looping (CaL) using integrated pellets is an alternative CO2 capture

   behavior of CaO, CuO and CuO/CaO integrated pellets used for multiple

   of thermal treatment and the presence of steam on the deactivation were
   also investigated. Nitrogen physisorption and scanning electron
   microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray analysis were used to characterize
   the pellets. The analysis revealed significant migration of the copper
   to the surface of the composite pellets, which likely suppressed
   carbonation capacity by reducing the accessibility of the CaO. While
   thermal pre-treatment and steam addition enhanced the performance of the
   base CaO pellets, the former led to cracks in the pellets. In contrast,
   thermal pretreatment of the CuO/CaO composite pellets resulted in worse

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design and integration of a vision-guided
   robotic system for automated and rapid vehicle inspection. The main goal
   of this work is to scan and explore regions of interest over an
   automotive vehicle while a manipulator's end effector operates in close
   proximity of the vehicle and safely accommodates its curves and inherent
   surface obstacles, such as outside mirrors or door handles, in order to
   perform a series of close inspection tasks. The project is motivated by
   applications in automated vehicle inspection, cleaning, and security
   screening. In order to efficiently navigate the robotic manipulator
   along the vehicle's surface within regions of interest that are
   selectively identified, an efficient and accurate integration of
   information from multiple RGB-D sensors and robotic components is
   proposed. The main components of the proposed approach include:
   automated vehicle category recognition from visual information; RGB-D
   sensors calibration; extraction of specific areas to inspect over the
   vehicle body, and path planning from an efficiently reconstructed 3D
   surface mesh to move the robotic arm along and in close proximity of the
   vehicle. The proposed multi-stage system developed merges all components
   to achieve rapid 3D profiling over a complex surface in order to fully
   automate the process of surface following for vehicles of various types
   and shapes. To validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the
   proposed method experiments are carried out with a 7-DOF manipulator
   navigating over automotive body panels.}},

Abstract = {{Water content and matric suction changes in unsaturated expansive soils
   due to environmental variations contribute to the overall volume changes
   (shrinkage or swelling). The soil movements cause tilt in trees, highway
   surfaces, building foundations and pipelines and pose problems to the
   functionality of the infrastructure. In this paper, a modulus of
   elasticity-based method approach (MEBM) proposed by Adem and Vanapalli
   (2013a) is tested for modelling the soil-environment interactions for a
   test site with an expansive soil deposit that was modelled by Ito and Hu
   (2011) for 1 year. In the MEBM, the soil suction changes in the active
   zone and the associated modulus of elasticity were estimated and used as
   key parameters in a volume change constitutive relationship to model the
   soil-environment interactions over time. The MEBM approach reasonably
   models the water content and matric suction changes over time and the
   swelling-shrinkage movements. The study results are encouraging for
   extending the simple MEBM in practice for rational design purposes of
   both the sub-and superstructures constructed in or on expansive soils.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity-achieving signaling strategies for the Gaussian wiretap
   multiple-input multple-output (MIMO) channel are investigated without
   the degradedness assumption. In addition to known solutions, a number of
   new rank-deficient solutions for the optimal transmit covariance matrix
   are obtained. The case of a weak eavesdropper is considered in detail,
   and the optimal covariance is established in an explicit, closed form
   with no extra assumptions. This provides lower and upper bounds to the
   secrecy capacity in the general case with a bounded gap, which are tight
   for a weak eavesdropper or/and low SNR. Closed-form solutions are also
   obtained for isotropic and omnidirectional eavesdroppers, based on which
   lower and upper bounds to the secrecy capacity are established in the
   general case. Sufficient and necessary conditions for the optimality of
   three popular transmission techniques, namely, the zero-forcing (ZF),
   the standard water-filling over the channel eigenmodes, and the
   isotropic signaling (IS), are established for the MIMO wiretap channel.
   These solutions are appealing due to their lower complexity. In
   particular, no wiretap codes are needed for the ZF transmission, and no
   precoding or feedback is needed for the isotropic signaling.}},

Abstract = {{Video streaming over vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) is an attractive
   application that provides many useful services for drivers. However,
   many problems need resolving, most of which are related to packet delay
   and packet loss. Due to the specific environment of VANETs, it is
   difficult to apply conventional protocols originally developed for the
   Internet, such as Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). Previous research
   works have offered many new protocols to solve this problem. However,
   most of them cannot make full use of existing Internet video-streaming
   resources like RTP players and servers. In this paper, we propose the
   converter model to solve this compatibility issue. Based on this model,
   we first modify the RTP using the erasure coding (EC) technique to
   address the high packet loss rate of VANETs. This protocol is known as
   EC-RTP. Then, we develop two converters; the first stands on the
   boundary between the Internet and VANETs. It receives the RTP packets
   from the Internet and translates them to EC-RTP packets, which are
   shared between vehicles. The second converter receives EC-RTP packets,
   translates them back to RTP packets, and then sends them to the RTP
   player.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the dynamics of unconfined hydrogen-air flames and
   the criterion for flame propagation between neighbouring pockets of
   reactive gas separated by air using the soap bubble technique. The
   combustion events were visualized using high-speed schlieren or
   large-scale shadowgraph systems. It was revealed that for sufficiently
   lean hydrogen-air mixtures characterized by low flame speeds, buoyancy
   effects become important at small scales. The critical radius of
   hemispherical flame that will rise due to buoyancy is highly sensitive
   to the hydrogen concentration. The test results demonstrate that for
   transition of a flame between neighbouring pockets, the separation
   distance between the bubbles is mainly determined by the expansion ratio
   for near stoichiometric mixture, but it becomes much smaller for leaner
   mixtures because the flame kernel rises due to buoyant effects before
   the flame can reach the second bubble, thus the separation distance is
   no longer governed by the expansion ratio.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the first study on scheduling for cooperative data
   dissemination in a hybrid infrastructure-to-vehicle (I2V) and
   vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication environment. We formulate the
   novel problem of cooperative data scheduling (CDS). Each vehicle informs
   the road-side unit (RSU) the list of its current neighboring vehicles
   and the identifiers of the retrieved and newly requested data. The RSU
   then selects sender and receiver vehicles and corresponding data for V2V
   communication, while it simultaneously broadcasts a data item to
   vehicles that are instructed to tune into the I2V channel. The goal is
   to maximize the number of vehicles that retrieve their requested data.
   We prove that CDS is NP-hard by constructing a polynomial-time reduction
   from the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem. Scheduling
   decisions are made by transforming CDS to MWIS and using a greedy method
   to approximately solve MWIS. We build a simulation model based on
   realistic traffic and communication characteristics and demonstrate the
   superiority and scalability of the proposed solution. The proposed model
   and solution, which are based on the centralized scheduler at the RSU,
   represent the first known vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)
   implementation of software defined network (SDN) concept.}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Debris in high-volume, high velocity flows, such as tsunamis, storm
   surges, and dam breaks, cause widespread damage to coastal communities.
   Evaluating the motion of the debris within the flow is difficult due to
   the variety of variables that can affect the motion, therefore
   techniques must be developed to quickly and accurately track the motion
   of the debris within the flow. This paper presents an optical tracking
   technique to track the motion of debris over a horizontal bottom under
   laboratory conditions. The debris consisted of scaled-down shipping
   containers, made of polyethylene (PE), placed on a dry, raised, flat
   section of the basin floor. Container movement was measured using two
   overhead cameras and a novel object tracking and detection algorithm
   implemented in MATLAB. The algorithm was developed to be able to quickly
   and accurately track uniform containers throughout an experimental run.
   The algorithm combines image-processing techniques such as Color
   Thresholding and Blob Analysis with tracking methods such as the Kalman
   Filter and Hungarian (Munkres) Algorithm. The algorithm was evaluated by
   comparing the results to those from a manual tracking method. For
   experiments with one, three, and six containers, the algorithm showed
   good agreement with the results of the manual method. However, with nine
   containers, the increase in the amount of container-container collisions
   and the agglomeration of the containers resulted in poor results
   compared to the manual method. While the algorithm is only evaluated
   here to track the motion of the shipping containers, there is potential
   for its use in many other fields of hydraulic and coastal engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Optical bulk (refractometric) sensing of sample solutions is
   demonstrated using dual-output Mach-Zehnder interferometers built from
   long-range surface-plasmon polariton waveguides operating at a
   free-space wavelength of 1375 nm. The device of interest was constructed
   by embedding Au stripes inCytopcladdings and etching a fluidic channel
   through the top cladding of one arm of the interferometer to expose the
   Au stripe. Bulk sensing was carried out by flowing sequentially a series
   of solutions of different refractive index through the microfluidic
   channel. The optical powers of the two outputs responded sinusoidally
   and were complimentary, as expected in theory. Three detection schemes
   aiming at improving the detection limit are analyzed showing that the
   device benefits from a 2x larger dynamic range, and has the ability to
   suppress common perturbations, relative to a single output. A detection
   limit of similar to 4 x 10(-6) RIU is demonstrated, which can be further
   improved by lengthening the sensing channel. The device is promising for
   application as a biosensor.}},

Abstract = {{A coherent radio over fiber (RoF) system based on optical
   single-sideband modulation with no optical carrier (OSSB) for ultradense
   wavelength division multiplexing passive optical networks (UDWDM-PONs)
   is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. For one channel of the
   UDWDM-PONs, at the transmitter, the OSSB RoF signal is generated using a
   dual parallel Mach-Zehnder modulator (DP-MZM) with a real-valued
   precoded microwave vector signal which is applied to the DP-MZM via the
   two electrodes with one having a 90 degrees phase shift. Then, the OSSB
   RoF signal is sent to a coherent receiver over a single-mode fiber
   (SMF). The coherent receiver with a free-running laser source as a local
   oscillator (LO) is used to perform the coherent detection. To recover
   the standard microwave vector signals from the real-valued precoded
   microwave vector signal that is embedded in a strong phase noise
   introduced by both the transmitter laser source and the LO laser source,
   a digital signal processing algorithm is developed to perform phase
   noise cancellation. An experiment is performed. The transmission of a
   1.25-Gbps quadrature phase shift keying, a 1.875-Gbps eight-phase shift
   keying (8-PSK), and a 2.5-Gbps 16 quadrature amplitude modulation
   (16-QAM) microwave vector signals with a channel spacing as narrow as 3
   GHz over a 25-km SMF is experimentally demonstrated. For the
   transmission of the 2.5-Gbps 16-QAM microwave vector signal, the
   received optical sensitivity at forward error correction level over a
   25-km SMF link is -24.8 dBm, while for the 1.875-Gbps 8-PSK microwave
   vector signal, it can reach -29.8 dBm which leaves an enough margin to
   accommodate the splitting losses in the optical distribution networks.}},

Abstract = {{Image matching based on scale invariant feature transform (SIFT) is one
   of the most popular image matching algorithms, which exhibits high
   robustness and accuracy. Gray scale images rather than color images are
   generally used to get SIFT descriptors in order to reduce the
   complexity. The regions which have a similar grayscale level but
   different hues tend to produce wrong matching results in this case.
   Therefore, the loss of color information may result in decreasing of
   matching ratio. An image matching algorithm based on SIFT is proposed,
   which adds a color offset and an exposure offset when converting color
   images to grayscale images in order to enhance the matching ratio.
   Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively
   differentiate the regions with different colors but the similar
   grayscale level, and increase the matching ratio of image matching based
   on SIFT. Furthermore, it does not introduce much complexity than the
   traditional SIFT.}},

   Activity}},
Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this work, a series of novel flower-like Ag@AgCl/Bi2O2CO3 were
   prepared by simple and feasible oil-in-water self-assembly processes.
   The phase structures of as-prepared samples were examined by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD), Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM), UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy
   (DRS), X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF), etc. The characterization
   results indicated that the presence of Ag@AgCl did not affect the
   crystal structure, but exerted a great influence on the photocatalytic
   activity of Bi2O2CO3 and enhanced the absorption band of pure Bi2O2CO3.
   The photocatalytic activities of the Ag@AgCl/Bi2O2CO3 samples were
   determined by photocatalytic degradation of methylene blue (MB) under
   visible light irradiation. The Ag@AgCl (10 wt \%)/Bi2O2CO3 composite
   showed the highest photocatalytic activity, degrading 97.9\% MB after
   irradiation for 20 min, which is over 1.64 and 3.66 times faster than
   that of pure Ag@AgCl (calculated based on the equivalent Ag@AgCl content
   in Ag@AgCl (10 wt \%)/Bi2O2CO3) and pure Bi2O2CO3, respectively.
   Bisphenol A (BPA) was also degraded to further prove the degradation
   ability of Ag@AgCl/Bi2O2CO3. Photocurrent studies indicated that the
   recombination of photo-generated electron hole pairs was decreased
   effectively due to the formation of heterojunctions between flower-like
   Bi2O2CO3 and Ag@AgCl nanoparticles. Trapping experiments indicated that
   O-2(-), h(+) and Cl degrees acted as the main reactive species for MB
   degradation in the present photocatalytic system. Furthermore, the
   cycling experiments revealed the good stability of Ag@AgCl/Bi2O2CO3
   composites. Based on the above, a photocatalytic mechanism for the
   degradation of organic compounds over Ag@AgCI/Bi2O2CO3 was proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Tag anticollision is critical to the performance of many radio frequency
   identification systems in industrial applications. Tree-based schemes
   are popular arbitration algorithms for tag collision, as they are
   scalable and easy to implement. In these schemes, collided tags are
   recursively divided into two groups until each group contains only one
   tag. However, we have determined that previous pure tree-based schemes
   do not fully utilize the information that can be collected; they allow
   only the responding tags to be involved in the splitting process. In
   this paper, we propose a novel pure tree-based method that we named
   parallel splitting with retrieve (PSR), which allows both the
   nonresponding and unidentified tags to also be involved in the splitting
   process. PSR consists of two mechanisms: parallel splitting (PS) and
   retrieve. The PS mechanism can reduce the total number of tag collisions
   and the retrieve mechanism can reduce the extra idle slots caused by PS.
   In comparison with conventional pure tree-based schemes, the proposed
   PSR algorithm achieves higher efficiency without the need to estimate
   the number of tags; simulation results indicate an efficiency level of
   0.41. The PSR algorithm also has similar performance to state-of-the-art
   algorithms that do not need to estimate the number of tags, but it is
   simpler to implement and is thus preferred for resource constrained
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of light-frame wood stud walls under simulated blast

   study investigates, experimentally and analytically, whether walls with

   regions are capable of resisting blast loadings such that the walls'
   ultimate capacity can be reached. The study also investigates the
   behaviour of different connections with various design capacity levels
   to develop failure in the stud wall system rather than in the
   connection. A total of ten full-scale walls with different boundary
   conditions were tested dynamically. The results showed that typical
   prescriptive connection detailing did not perform adequately. Designed
   connections performed well, but the findings show that basing the
   connection design solely on capacity may be inadequate. Single
   degree-of-freedom modelling may only be utilized if damage in the

Abstract = {{A grating-based Fabry-Perot (FP) cavity-coupled microring resonator on a
   silicon chip is reported to demonstrate an all-optically tunable Fano
   resonance. In the device, an add-drop microring resonator (MRR) is
   employed, and one of the two bus waveguides is replaced by an FP cavity
   consisting of two sidewall Bragg gratings. By choosing the parameters of
   the gratings, the resonant mode of the FP cavity is coupled to one of
   the resonant modes of the MRR. Due to the coupling between the resonant
   modes, a Fano resonance with an asymmetric line shape resulted.
   Measurement results show a Fano resonance with an extinction ratio of
   22.54 dB, and a slope rate of 250.4 dB/nm is achieved. A further study
   of the effect of the coupling on the Fano resonance is performed
   numerically and experimentally. Thanks to the strong light-confinement
   capacity of the MRR and the FP cavity, a strong two-photon absorption
   induced nonlinear thermal-optic effect resulted, which is used to tune
   the Fano resonance optically. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Efficient visual information for unfamiliar face matching despite
   viewpoint variations: It's not in the eyes!}},
Journal = {{VISION RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{33-40}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Faces are encountered in highly diverse angles in real-world settings.
   Despite this considerable diversity, most individuals are able to easily
   recognize familiar faces. The vast majority of studies in the field of
   face recognition have nonetheless focused almost exclusively on frontal
   views of faces. Indeed, a number of authors have investigated the
   diagnostic facial features for the recognition of frontal views of faces
   previously encoded in this same view. However, the nature of the
   information useful for identity matching when the encoded face and test
   face differ in viewing angle remains mostly unexplored. The present
   study addresses this issue using individual differences and bubbles, a
   method that pinpoints the facial features effectively used in a visual
   categorization task. Our results indicate that the use of features
   located in the center of the face, the lower left portion of the nose
   area and the center of the mouth, are significantly associated with
   individual efficiency to generalize a face's identity across different
   viewpoints. However, as faces become more familiar, the reliance on this
   area decreases, while the diagnosticity of the eye region increases.
   This suggests that a certain distinction can be made between the visual
   mechanisms subtending viewpoint invariance and face recognition in the
   case of unfamiliar face identification. Our results further support the
   idea that the eye area may only come into play when the face stimulus is
   particularly familiar to the observer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Objective: While health information technology (HIT) offers great
   potential for supporting healthcare delivery, interoperability issues
   can be a barrier to effective use of HIT. While technical and semantic
   interoperability issues have been well studied there is a shortage of
   research that addresses process interoperability.
   Methods: This paper uses a two year case study of a Palliative Care
   Information System (PAL IS) to study process interoperability and health
   information technology (HIT). We describe the design of PAL-IS and
   develop and describe three types of process interoperability issues that
   arose from its implementation.
   Results: The implementation of PAL-IS caused care delivery, clinical
   practice and administrative process interoperability issues. Further,
   many of these issues emerged over time and a solution to address one
   type of process interoperability issue often led to a different type of
   issue. We used our evaluation of PAL-IS to develop a general framework
   for understanding process interoperability and HIT.
   Conclusion: Designing HIT to support care delivery is a complex
   sociotechnical endeavor that can result in different types of process
   interoperability issues. Evaluating process interoperability takes time
   and longitudinal studies are necessary to understand the overall
   ecosystem where technology, processes, and people interact. The
   framework developed in this paper provides a starting point for the
   evaluation of process interoperability and HIT. (C) 2016 Fellowship of

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND GEOTECHNICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{154-169}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The influence of the stress regime change and associated softening can
   be significant on unsaturated expansive soil slope stability due to soil
   swelling upon wetting, which cannot be considered in conventional
   hydrological models. In this paper, the shallow expansive soil slope
   failure mechanism is addressed in the framework of an infinite slope
   formulation. The unsaturated soil elasto-plastic constitutive
   relationship is utilized for interpretation of stress regime evolution
   induced by expansive soil swelling during infiltration. The extended
   Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion for unsaturated soils is used as the
   yield surface, under which the nonlinear elastic behavior is considered
   by quantifying the effect of two stress state variables (net stress and
   suction) on elasticity parameters. The strain softening behavior in
   unsaturated soils is accounted for via reducing the material parameters
   of the yield surface with respect to plastic deviatoric strain. A
   numerical exercise is performed on a relatively gentle slope in Regina,
   Canada with highly expansive soil properties, using the developed
   computer program that implements the constitutive model into infinite
   slope formulation. The results suggest that neglecting the
   swelling-induced stress change and associated softening behavior can
   significantly overestimate the stability of expansive soil shallow layer
   under infiltration, in terms of both failure occurrence and failure
   time. Additional parametric study shows that all the considered
   parameters (including initial stress condition, softening rate and slope
   angle) have a considerable effect on the failure time and failure depth
   of the shallow deposit, which have important implications for the
   engineering design of expansive soil slopes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A numerical model has been developed employing an orthogonal stream-tube
   gridding system for the investigation of mixing patterns in meandering
   rivers. The proposed model couples field data and modeling. It uses a
   measured velocity field to solve the advection-diffusion equation. This
   equation provides a practical simulation with greater accuracy and lower
   computational cost for estimation of mixing in meandering channels with
   a long, full mixing length. The model has been used to estimate the
   transverse mixing coefficient in surveyed subreaches of the North
   Saskatchewan River in Canada. Good agreement was observed between the
   numerical and measured tracer concentrations using reasonable values for
   the transverse mixing coefficient. The average dimensionless transverse
   mixing coefficient from the calibrated numerical model for the surveyed
   reach was 0.39, which was consistent with values estimated using
   empirical formulas for transverse mixing coefficients in natural
   meandering rivers. The estimated transverse mixing coefficient was more
   than an order of magnitude higher in a subreach with a sharp bend than
   in other subreaches. For comparison, the transverse mixing coefficient
   was also calculated analytically from standard and general methods of
   moments between some sections. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Goal models represent interests, intentions, and strategies of different
   stakeholders. Reasoning about the goals of a system unavoidably involves
   the transformation of unclear stakeholder requirements into
   goal-oriented models. The ability to validate goal models would support
   the early detection of unclear requirements, ambiguities, and conflicts.
   In this paper, we propose a novel validation approach based on the
   Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) to check the correctness of GRL
   goal models through statistical analyses of data collected from
   generated questionnaires. System stakeholders (e.g., customers,
   shareholders, and managers) may have different objectives, interests,
   and priorities. Stakeholder conflicts arise when the needs of some group
   of stakeholder compromise the expectations of some other group(s) of
   stakeholders. Our proposed approach allows for early detection of
   potential conflicts amongst intervening stakeholders of the system. In
   order to illustrate and demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we
   apply it to a case study of a GRL model describing the fostering of the
   relationship between the university and its alumni. The approach brings
   unique benefits over the state of the art and is complementary to
   existing validation approaches.}},

Title = {{Use of muscle synergies and wavelet transforms to identify fatigue

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND KINESIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Pages = {{158-166}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to supplement continuous wavelet
   transforms with muscle synergies in a fatigue analysis to better
   describe the combination of decreased firing frequency and altered
   activation profiles during dynamic muscle contractions. Nine healthy
   young individuals completed the dynamic tasks before and after they
   squatted with a standard Olympic bar until complete exhaustion.
   Electromyography (EMG) profiles were analyzed with a novel concatenated
   non-negative matrix factorization method that decomposed EMG signals
   into muscle synergies. Muscle synergy analysis provides the activation
   pattern of the muscles while continuous wavelet transforms output the
   temporal frequency content of the EMG signals. Synergy analysis revealed
   subtle changes in two-legged squatting after fatigue while differences
   in one-legged squatting were more pronounced and included the shift from
   a general co-activation of muscles in the pre-fatigue state to a knee
   extensor dominant weighting post-fatigue. Continuous wavelet transforms
   showed major frequency content decreases in two-legged squatting after
   fatigue while very few frequency changes occurred in one-legged

Abstract = {{These days, there are huge amount of multimedia contents that are
   available for users. Selecting and exploiting favorite contents from
   such online available collections is a big challenge for users as well
   as smart engines due to the overwhelming huge number of available
   contents. This paper proposes a new model to help recommendation systems
   to select the most appropriate, favorite, or related contents by
   integrating contextual parameters. The proposed new context-aware
   recommendation model enriches the recommendation process with context to
   tailor the recommendation results to individual users. By leveraging the
   social tagging, our proposed model computes the latent preference of
   users on contexts from other similar contexts, as well as latent
   assignment of contexts for items from other similar items. By finding
   the similarities between the user's contexts and among the contexts and
   items, we can determine the attractive items given a particular context.
   We then map the context on the items depending on that particular user,
   in order to recommend the most relevant item suitable to the user's
   needs. Our evaluation results have shown a potential improvement to the
   recommendation quality compared to state-of-the-art recommendation
   algorithms that consider contextual information. We also compare the
   proposed model to other approaches where user's context is not used for
   personalizing the recommendation results.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Current technical knowledge on the rheological behaviour of cemented
   paste backfill (CPB) is available for mines that have temperatures above
   zero, but this information is often unreliable when transposed to mines
   in permafrost or cold regions. The assessment and understanding of the
   yield stress of CPB and its evolution with time when exposed to
   sub-zero{''} environmental temperatures are critical for applying CPB
   technology to underground mines in cold and permafrost regions.
   Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate and develop a better
   understanding of the combined effects of time and sub-zero temperatures
   on a key rheological property (yield stress) of CPB. Several CPB
   mixtures of various compositions are exposed to various
   sub-zero-temperatures (-1 degrees C, 6 degrees C and 12 degrees C) or
   placed in room temperature up to 4 h. The yield stress of the CPB is
   determined after specific times. Furthermore, microstructural analyses
   and electrical conductivity monitoring are conducted on the CPB samples.
   It is found that the yield stress for the CPB samples exposed to the
   studied sub-zero temperatures is much lower than that of the sample
   placed in room temperature. Increases in the water cement ratio and
   sodium chloride concentration, and decreases in the sub-zero curing
   temperatures lead to lower yield stress. The results also show that the
   yield stress of CPB is strongly affected by the mineralogical and
   chemical compositions of the tailings. The findings of this study have
   significant implications for backfill practices in permafrost and cold
   regions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the static behaviour of reinforced concrete
   beams at low temperatures compared to similar beams tested at room
   temperature. Four large-scale beams were fabricated and tested. The
   testing program for the beams consisted of four stages: incrementally
   loading the beams to a service load of 90 kN, sustaining the load at 90
   kN for 48 h, cycling the load between 50 kN and 90 kN for 10 cycles, and
   loading the beam to failure. All of the beams had temperature
   differentials over their depth to simulate solar radiation and
   in-service temperature of the bridges. The beams tested at low
   temperature (-25 degrees C) demonstrated an increase in strength and
   ductility up to 13\% and 34\% respectively compared to the beams tested
   at +15 degrees C. The results also show that the cracking load increased
   while the number and the depth of the cracks decreased at low
   temperature. In addition, the widths of the shear cracks were reduced at
   low temperature compared to their counterparts at room temperature. The
   load at which the stirrups contributed structurally also increased
   drastically at low temperature. In this research, DIC/PIV technique was
   used to measure the widths of the shear cracks, and the effect of low
   temperature on the camera system was investigated through calibration
   tests to ensure the accuracy of the measured crack widths. (c) 2016

Abstract = {{This study aims to explore the effects of a serious game on perceived
   team cohesiveness in a multi-user virtual environment. A one-shot case
   study/post-test only experiment design was used in this study. A
   questionnaire was administered to the participants, who played the
   serious game Zoom. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the
   proposed framework. The results indicated that the overall framework is
   statistically significant. The user interface elements of the game and
   the attitudes of the participants towards the game affected perceived
   team cohesiveness, whilst the personality factor ``extraversion{''} was
   found to have a moderator effect on these relationships. The study is
   limited by the sample size, the self-reported survey and the fact that
   it had only one game play. The proposed framework of the study can be
   used by educators, researchers and managers working with groups to
   foster team cohesiveness in their organizations. This study differs from
   previous studies mainly by the application of a statistical model to
   observe the effects of multi-user virtual environment serious games on

Abstract = {{The aim of this research was the analysis of heat and mass transfer in
   vacuum membrane distillation (VMD), specifically for a dead-end feed
   set-up. The influence of support material on the supported membranes VMD
   performance was identified. A mathematical model was proposed to
   evaluate the membrane/feed interface temperature, membrane tortuosity,
   membrane mass transfer coefficient, and temperature polarization
   coefficient (TPC). The model was solved by an excel solver based on
   experimental results of feed temperature, system pressure and the
   evaporative fluxes. The SEM images showed that the thickness of
   unsupported membrane was reduced by 42\% after the VMD test. Pore
   shrinkage and tortuosity increase were also expected during this pore
   collapsing process. On the other hand, the cross-sectional views of the
   supported membranes did not show significant changes. These results show
   that the support material can help prevent the membrane pore channel
   structure from collapsing during the VMD experiment. TPC is close to
   unity at low feed temperatures. However, it decreases with an increase
   in evaporation flux as the feed temperature increases, or when a high
   flux supported membrane is applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Hydrocarbon-contaminated environments often also experience
   co-contamination with elevated levels of salt. This paper investigates
   the occurrence of halotolerance among several hydrocarbon-degrading
   bacteria, as an initial assessment of the importance of salt
   contamination to bioremediation strategies. Halotolerance was common,
   but not ubiquitous, among the 12 hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria tested,
   with many strains growing at up to 75 or 100g NaClL-1 in rich medium.
   Greater sensitivity to elevated salt concentrations was observed among
   aromatics degraders compared to saturates degraders, and in defined
   medium compared to rich medium. Observed effects of high salt
   concentrations included increased lag times and decreased maximum
   growth. Many strains exhibited flocculation at elevated salt
   concentrations, but this did not correlate to any patterns in cell
   surface hydrophobicity, measured using the Bacterial Adhesion to
   Hydrocarbon assay. The occurrence of halotolerance in
   hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria suggests the potential for native
   microorganisms to contribute to the bioremediation of oil and salt
   co-contaminated sites, and indicates the need for a better understanding
   of the relationship between halotolerance and hydrocarbon biodegradation

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to investigate the mesophilic, anaerobic,
   co-digestion of scum with thickened waste activated sludge (TWAS) and
   primary sludge (PS). Observations of the reactor waste show that higher
   pretreatment temperatures assist in scum integration and appear to limit
   coagulation and separation effects associated with digesting fats, oils
   and greases. The 0.40 kg VS/m(3) . d scum loaded reactor with scum
   pretreated at 70 degrees C achieved the greatest improvement in biogas
   production over PS and TWAS co-digestion without scum addition. Based on
   cell viability analysis of the reactor waste, scum-containing reactors
   were shown to produce 48 and 39\% more biogas per m(3) of live cells;
   signifying that scum addition increased the activity of the microbial
   population embedded in the waste or caused a microbial shift in the
   waste towards more active communities.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, there is no standard bench-scale dead-end ultrafiltration
   (UF) testing system. The aim of the present study was to design and
   build a bench-scale hollow fiber UF system to assess the impact of
   operational parameters on membrane performance and fouling. A
   bench-scale hollow fiber UF system was built to operate at a constant
   flux (+/- 2\% of the set-point flux) and included automated backwash
   cycles. The development of the bench-scale system showed that it is very
   difficult to maintain a constant flux during the first minute of the
   filtration cycles, that digital flow meters are problematic, and that
   the volume of the backwash waste lines should be minimized. The system
   was evaluated with Ottawa River water, which has a relatively high
   hydrophobic natural organic matter content and is typical of Northern
   Canadian waters. The testing using different permeate fluxes, filtration
   cycle duration and backwash cycle duration showed that this system
   mimics the performance of larger systems and may be used to assess the
   impact of operating conditions on membrane fouling and alternative
   pretreatment options. Modeling the first, middle, and last filtration
   cycles of the six runs using single and dual blocking mechanisms yielded
   inconsistent results regarding the controlling fouling mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: Measures of protein functional similarity are essential
   tools for function prediction, evaluation of protein-protein
   interactions (PPIs) and other applications. Several existing methods
   perform comparisons between proteins based on the semantic similarity of
   their GO terms; however, these measures are highly sensitive to
   modifications in the topological structure of GO, tend to be focused on
   specific analytical tasks and concentrate on the GO terms themselves
   rather than considering their textual definitions.
   Results: We introduce simDEF, an efficient method for measuring semantic
   similarity of GO terms using their GO definitions, which is based on the
   Gloss Vector measure commonly used in natural language processing. The
   simDEF approach builds optimized definition vectors for all relevant GO
   terms, and expresses the similarity of a pair of proteins as the cosine
   of the angle between their definition vectors. Relative to existing
   similarity measures, when validated on a yeast reference database,
   simDEF improves correlation with sequence homology by up to 50\%, shows
   a correlation improvement > 4\% with gene expression in the biological
   process hierarchy of GO and increases PPI predictability by > 2.5\% in
   F1 score for molecular function hierarchy.}},

Abstract = {{Many bioinformatics applications, such as the optimal pairwise
   biological sequence comparison, demand a great quantity of computing
   resource, thus are excellent candidates to run in high-performance
   computing (HPC) platforms. In the last two decades, a large number of
   HPC-based solutions were proposed for this problem that run in different
   platforms, targeting different types of comparisons with slightly
   different algorithms and making the comparative analysis of these
   approaches very difficult. This article proposes a classification of
   parallel optimal pairwise sequence comparison solutions, in order to
   highlight their main characteristics in a unifiedway. We then discuss
   several HPC-based solutions, including clusters ofmulticores and
   accelerators such as Cell Broadband Engines (CellBEs),
   Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), Graphics Processing Units (GPUs)
   and Intel Xeon Phi, as well as hybrid solutions, which combine two or
   more platforms, providing the actual landscape of the main proposals in
   this area. Finally, we present open questions and perspectives in this

Abstract = {{This paper presents an experimental investigation of the racking
   performance of light-frame wood shear walls to evaluate the effect of
   Type X gypsum wall board (GWB). Twelve shear walls sheathed with
   oriented strand board (OSB) alone, GWB alone, or in combination were
   tested under static monotonic or reversed cyclic lateral load. The
   racking performance of these wall specimens in terms of stiffness,
   strength, ultimate displacement, ductility, energy dissipation, and
   failure modes was investigated. Specifically the effects of panel
   orientation, GWB panel joint taping, and double-layer GWB were examined.
   It was found that shear walls sheathed with GWB provide ductility ratios
   similar to or higher than those of OSB sheathed walls. The direct
   superposition rule can be applied to estimate the overall strength of a
   shear wall sheathed with single-layer OSB and GWB on opposite faces,
   provided there is no panel joint taping and the panel orientation is the
   same for both materials. The superposition rule proposed in current
   United States standards provides a conservative estimate for other cases
   considered in this study. In addition, shear walls with two GWB panels
   jointed by taping and double-layer GWB panels behaved like shear walls
   sheathed with a single large-size panel, leading to a reduction in the
   system ductility ratio and corresponding seismic force modification
   factor. This test series have provided essential test data for future
   modeling work to investigate the seismic response analysis of light
   wood-frame buildings containing Type X GWB. (C) 2016 American Society of

Abstract = {{Scour protection around hydraulic structures in fluvial, estuarine, and
   coastal waters is an essential component of a meaningful and durable
   design. The continuous optimization of scour protection systems and
   design approaches leads to faster and more cost-effective construction
   processes. Although scour protection now often consists of a two-layer
   design, approaches that incorporate only one layer depict a major step
   forward. Therefore, this research focuses on the stability of a
   wide-graded quarry-stone mixture consisting of crushed granodiorite
   (Jelsa quarry, Norway) with fractions ranging from 0.063 to 200 mm. The
   material was exposed to an incrementally increased unidirectional
   current in a closed-circuit flume. The induced flow field and leading
   parameters were measured at various positions horizontally and
   vertically, whereas the erosion rates were determined behind the test
   bed specimen. With increasing flow velocity the development of a static
   armor layer was observed at the bed surface. Bed-shear stresses were
   determined to be strongly variable across the rough test bed. Fractional
   critical shear stresses indicate highly selective mobility of individual
   fractions. Least-square fitting of the determined critical shear
   stresses based on the dimensionless reference grain size d(i)/d(sigma)
   (with d(sigma) as the product of the geometric mean size d(g) and the
   geometric standard deviation sigma(g)) is suitable for describing the
   stability behavior of the investigated material. This work is made

Abstract = {{The effect of comminution, drying, and densification on bubbling
   fluidized bed gasification was investigated by fractionating a forestry
   residue into a feedstock consisting of different particle sizes,
   moisture levels, and by densifying to pellets. The gasification
   performance was evaluated at nominal average bed temperatures of 725
   degrees, 800 degrees and 875 degrees C at a constant fluidizing velocity
   (0.91 m s(-1)) with feed input rates between 9 and 24 kg h(-1).
   The gas composition was observed to be influenced by both the particle
   size and form. Smaller particles led to a gas richer in carbon monoxide
   and depleted in hydrogen. The gasification of pellets led to a gas with
   the greatest hydrogen to carbon monoxide ratio. The smallest particles
   tested resulted in the worst gasification performance, as defined by
   cold gas efficiency, carbon conversion, and tar production. Despite
   differences in the gas composition among the larger particles and the
   pellets, similar carbon conversion and cold gas efficiency was observed.
   Relative to comparable test conditions with dry feed fractions (having a
   moisture mass fraction of 7-12\%), an average 11\% increase in carbon
   conversion was observed for the wetter feed fractions containing a
   moisture mass fraction of 24-31\%. This increase in carbon conversion
   offset much of the expected decrease in cold gas efficiency by using a
   wetter feed material. A slight increase in hydrogen production and
   negligible change in tar production was observed for the wetter feed
   fractions relative to the dry feed fraction. (C) 2016 Published by

   process. This process is plagued, however, with high recovery costs
   because of the low final butanol concentration (approximate to 0.01g/g,
   1wt\%) due to product inhibition on the microorganisms. To partly
   alleviate this problem and increase productivity, in situ butanol
   recovery techniques from the fermentation broth were proposed. These
   integrated methods increase the final concentration of butanol, and as a
   result improve the separation efficiency of the process. This paper
   compares the economic feasibility of a large-scale continuous ABE
   fermentation process with and without integrating a vacuum separation
   unit. It is illustrated that based on the current market price of
   butanol, only the integrated fermentation process is economically
   feasible for discount rates up to approximate to 45\%. Adding an in situ
   butanol recovery technique made this process profitable compared to the
   conventional fermentation process analyzed under two different
   scenarios: constant fermenter volume and constant butanol production
   rate. The net present values (NPV) of the conventional process were
   found to be negative for both scenarios, whereas the integrated vacuum
   process had a NPV of US\$87000000 at the end of 10 years of operation
   based on a discount rate of 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{A novel Ag/AgBr-activated carbon (AC) composite photocatalyst was
   proposed and investigated. The composite was prepared by
   impregnation-precipitation-photoreduction, and characterized by X-ray
   diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, N-2 sorption, and
   ultraviolet-visible light diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The prepared
   material possessed an ``egg-shell{''} structure, where the photocatalyst
   formed heterogeneous agglomerates on the outside surface of the
   adsorbent host material. Ag/AgBr-AC exhibited enhanced absorption in the
   visible light region, and photocatalysis was studied for the degradation
   of model organic pollutants (methyl orange dye (MO), phenol) and a model
   microorganism (Escherichia coli K-12). Photocatalytic degradation of
   organic pollutants under visible light occurred with pseudo-first order
   rate constants of 0.0491 min(-1) and 0.007 min(-1) for MO and phenol,
   respectively using a catalyst loading of 0.5 g L-1. Photocatalytic
   inactivation of 50 mL of a 106 CFU mL(-1) bacterial suspension induced a
   3-log loss of culturability in 60 min with a catalyst loading of 5 g
   L-1. The mechanism of photocatalytic action for Ag/AgBr-AC composites
   was discussed with respect to the adsorption, localized surface plasmon
   resonance, and conventional semiconductor photocatalysis processes that
   took place under visible light. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A family of three finite elements is developed for the lateral-torsional
   buckling analysis of thin-walled members with doubly symmetric
   cross-sections. The elements are based on a recently derived variational
   principle which incorporates shear deformation effects in conjunction
   with a special interpolation scheme ensuring Cl continuity. One of the
   elements is developed such that it consistently converges from above
   while another element is intended to consistently converge from below.
   The third element exhibits fast convergence characteristics compared to
   other elements but cannot be guaranteed to provide either an upper or a
   lower bound solution. The formulation incorporates the ability to
   enforce any set of linear multi-point kinematic constraints. The
   validity of the solution is established through comparisons with other
   well-established numerical solutions. The elements are then used to
   solve practical problems involving simply supported beams, cantilevers
   and continuous beams under a variety of loading conditions including
   concentrated loads, linear bending moments and uniformly distributed
   loads. The effect of lateral and torsional restraints and the location
   of lateral restraint along the section height on lateral-torsional
   buckling capacity of beams are also examined through examples. (C) 2016

Volume = {{368}},

Abstract = {{The energy concentration level is an important indicator for
   time-frequency analysis (TFA). Weak energy concentration would result in
   time-frequency representation (TFR) diffusion and thus leading to
   ambiguous results or even misleading signal analysis results,
   particularly for nonstationary multicomponent signals. To improve the
   energy concentration level, this paper proposes a generalized stepwise
   demodulation transform (GSDT). The rationale of the proposed method is
   that (1) the generalized demodulation (GD) can map the original signal
   into an analytic signal with constant instantaneous frequency (IF) and
   improve the energy concentration level on time-frequency plane, and (2)
   focusing on a short window around the time instant of interest, a
   backward demodulation operation can recover the original frequency at
   the time instant without affecting the improved energy concentration
   level. By repeating the backward demodulation at every time instant of
   interest, the TFR of the entire signal can be attained with enhanced
   energy concentration level. With the GSDT, an iterative GSDT (IGSDT) is
   developed to analyze multicomponent signal that is subjected to
   different modulating sources for their constituent components. The IGSDT
   iteratively demodulates each constituent component to attain its TFR and
   the TFR of the whole signal is derived from superposing all the
   resulting TFRs of constituent components. The cross-term free and more
   energy concentrated TFR of the signal is, therefore, obtained, and the
   diffusion in the TFR can be reduced. The GSDT-based synchrosqueezing
   transform is also elaborated to further enhance the GSDT(IGSDT) yielded
   TFR. The effectiveness of the proposed method in TFA is tested using
   both simulated monocomponent and multicomponent signals. The application
   of the proposed method to bearing fault detection is explored. Bearing
   condition and fault pattern can be revealed by the proposed method
   resulting TFR. The main advantages of the proposed method for bearing
   condition monitoring under variable speed conditions include: (a) it can
   simultaneously improve energy concentration level of signals of interest
   and remove interferences in the TFR, (b) it is resampling-free and hence
   can avoid the resampling related errors, and (c) it yields instantaneous
   frequencies for fault and shaft rotation and thus can carry out both
   fault detection and diagnosis tasks. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The recent advances in technology and mobile computing led to the rapid
   growth of networked 3D streaming applications. The emerging services can
   involve augmented reality, virtual environment walkthrough, multiplayer
   gaming just to mention a few. Because of the limited network bandwidth
   of the client-server approach, research works are now turning toward
   mobile ad hoc networks-based streaming, where the resources of each peer
   are used during the streaming service. Peer-to-peer technologies are
   considering the solution to adapt for scalable applications. Yet,
   supplying partner selection and 3D data delivery are still significant
   challenges to face because of the dynamic wireless environment that
   causes link breakages, high packet loss, an adverse impact on the
   quality of the 3D media, and a low user satisfaction. In this paper, we
   propose a supplying partner selection technique coupled with a content
   delivery technique for peer-to-peer 3D streaming over thin mobile
   devices. Our proposed protocol, which we refer to as MULTIPLY, considers
   multihop suppliers in order to alleviate the load on the server and uses
   the signal strength measurement to analyze the wireless link when
   sending back the 3D data. Given the high dynamicity of the network due
   to the mobility of the users, the streaming can be greatly affected. We
   therefore study the impact of the mobility on MULTIPLY. The performance
   evaluation of our protocol obtained using an extensive set of simulation
   experiments is then reported. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{An examination of the multidimensional range query in existing
   peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay networks indicates that multidimensional
   range queries are sensitive to underlying topologies; this is because
   partitioning and mapping of multidimensional data space are two
   interconnected parts of a process that must be carried out
   cooperatively. The first section focuses on how to preserve data
   localities, whereas the second section concerns how to accommodate and
   maintain data localities at the P2P overlay layer. There are many
   studies that have been conducted on the first section since 1966, and
   those works that are well accepted are mostly based on recursive
   decomposition, which forms a tree structure in nature. However, less
   effort has been made to provide comparable support from the P2P overlay
   layer. In our previous work, we proposed the Hierarchically Distributed
   Tree (HD Tree) in order to better support multidimensional range queries
   in the P2P overlay network. This paper further explores error-resilient
   routing and load balancing strategies that can be employed in the HD
   Tree. We also provide a complete set of experimental results for all
   routing operations: Join and Leave of nodes, range queries at different
   levels of selectivity, and the dynamic load balancing scheme.
   Comparisons are made by conducting simulations under both the ideal and
   the error-prone routing environment and within various ary HD Trees. The
   experimental results show that load balancing in the HD Tree can be
   adjusted dynamically and globally, and it is actually a trade-off
   between distributing the basic load and the involvement of nodes in
   range querying. The experimental results also indicate that a maximum of
   10 percent of routing nodes' failures do not have significant effects on
   the performance of range queries. However, a lower ary HD Tree appears
   to have better routing performance, whereas a higher ary HD Tree
   achieves a higher fault-tolerant capacity. Nevertheless, the performance
   of range queries in a higher ary HD Tree can be further optimized if all
   possible routing options can be fully explored in the error-prone
   routing environment. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{The self-assembly of twinned boehmite nanosheets into porous 3D
   structures in ethanol-water mixtures}},
Journal = {{COLLOIDS AND SURFACES A-PHYSICOCHEMICAL AND ENGINEERING ASPECTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{495}},

Month = {{APR 20}},
Abstract = {{Surfactant molecules have high surface activity, and can therefore
   influence the self-assembly of nano materials. The self-assembly of
   twinned boehmite nanosheets into porous 3D superstructures will be
   greatly affected by the presence of surfactant monomer and micelles in
   various ethanol-water mixtures. It should be possible to influence the
   shape, thickness, and twinning of boehmite nanosheets by varying the
   concentration of the surfactant and ethanol in the synthesis mixture to
   obtain high porosity 3D superstructures.
   Experiments: The critical micelle concentration (CMC) of cationic
   surfactant cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) was determined in 0,
   12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 vol\% ethanol-water mixtures. The effect of CTAB
   on boehmite particle morphology and superstructure formation during
   self-assembly was explored at the CMC, and at 20\%, 15\%, 10\%, 5\%
   below and above the CMC of CTAB in various ethanol-water mixtures.
   Findings: Boehmite nanosheets with controllable shape and thickness were
   successfully formed in various ethanol-water mixtures. Prior to micelle
   formation, the average thickness of nanosheets formed in 0 vol\%, 25
   vol\%, and 50 vol\% ethanol-water were 200 nm, 110 nm and 100 nm,
   respectively. Micelle formation reduced the availability of surfactant
   molecules for particle templating, broadening the nanosheet thickness
   distribution. Micelle formation was inhibited in 50 vol\% ethanol-water
   due to the increase in Gibbs free energy needed to form micelles
   relative to the Gibbs free energy of micelles in 0 vol\% or 25 vol\%
   ethanol-water. The enthalpy-driven process gives greater control over
   the nanosheet thickness, producing particles with narrow thickness
   distributions. In general, the CMC represented the point at which
   control is lost over the thickness of the nanoplatelets; increasing the
   surfactant concentration above the CMC increased the thickness of the
   nanoplatelets.
   Particle twinning during crystal growth produced an interconnected 3D
   network of boehmite particles with high porosity (79-88\%) and hydraulic
   permeability (62.4-809 mD). The addition of ethanol during synthesis
   increased the porosity and reduced the bulk density of the 3D
   superstructures by 8-11\% and 26-28\%, respectively, and yielded a

Abstract = {{The non-structural 1 (NS1) protein of the dengue virus circulates in
   infected patients' blood samples and can be used for early diagnosis of
   dengue infection. In this paper, we present the detection of naturally
   occurring dengue NS1 antigen in infected patient blood plasma using
   straight long-range surface plasmon waveguides. Three
   commercially-available anti-NS1 monoclonal antibodies were used for
   recognition and their performance was compared and discussed. A similar
   figure of merit to the one used in conventional dengue NS1 capture using
   an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to our results.
   In general, the positive patient samples can be clearly differentiated
   from the negative ones and the results agree with those obtained using
   ELISA. The largest signal-to-noise ratio observed during the experiments
   was 356 and the best detection limit observed is estimated as 5.73
   pg/mm(2). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we have assessed the potential application of group 13
   and 14 metal and metalloid phthalocyanines ((X)(n)-MPcs) and their
   axially substituted derivatives as hole-transporting layers in organic
   light emitting diodes (OLEDs). OLEDs studied herein have the generic
   structure of
   glass/ITO/(N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamin
   e (NPB) or (X)(n)-MPc)(50 nm)/Alq(3) (60 nm)/LiF (1 nm)/Al (80 nm),
   where X is an axial substituent group. OLEDs using chloro aluminum
   phthalocyanine (Cl-AlPc) showed good peak luminance values of 2620 +/-
   113 cd/m(2) at 11 V. To our knowledge, Cl-AlPc has not previously been
   shown to work as a hole transport material (HTL) in OLEDs. Conversely,
   the di-chlorides of silicon, germanium, and tin phthalocyanine
   (Cl-2-SiPc, Cl-2-GePc, and Cl-2-SnPc, respectively) showed poor
   performance compared to Cl-AlPc, having peak luminances of only 3864
   cd/m(2) (12 V), 2361 cd/m(2) (8.5 V), and 5965 cd/m(2) (13.5 V),
   respectively. However, by performing a simple axial substitution of the
   chloride groups of Cl-2-SiPc with pentafluorophenoxy groups, the
   resulting bis(pentafluorophenoxy) silicon phthalocyanine (F-10-SiPc)
   containing OLED had a peak luminance of 5141 +/- 941 cd/m(2) (10 V), a
   two order of magnitude increase over its chlorinated precursor. This
   material showed OLED characteristics approaching those of a baseline
   OLED based on the well-studied triarylamine NPB. Attempts to attach the
   pentafluorophenoxy axial group to both SnPc and GePc were hindered by
   synthetic difficulties and low thermal stability, respectively. In light
   of the performance improvements observed by simple axial substitution of
   SiPc in OLEDs, the use of axially substituted MPcs in organic electronic
   devices remains of continuing interest to us and potentially the field
   in general. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   scale mixer is comparable to the smaller scale mixer at flow rates
   similar to 8.5 times greater. The overall volumetric mass transfer
   coefficients of the reactive extraction, K(c)a, of both scale mixers
   were also similar at equal energy dissipation rate in the drop flow
   regime. Finally, the upper limit of the sizing approach is discussed and

Abstract = {{Loess soil deposits are widely distributed in arid and semi-arid regions
   and constitute about 10\% of land area of the world. These soils
   typically have a loose honeycomb-type meta-stable structure that is
   susceptible to a large reduction in total volume or collapse upon
   wetting. Collapse characteristics contribute to various problems to
   infrastructures that are constructed on loess soils. For this reason,
   collapse triggering mechanism for loess soils has been of significant
   interest for researchers and practitioners all over the world. This
   paper aims at providing a state-of-the-art review on collapse mechanism
   with special reference to loess soil deposits. The collapse mechanism
   studies are summarized under three different categories, i.e.
   traditional approaches, microstructure approach, and soil
   mechanics-based approaches. The traditional and microstructure
   approaches for interpreting the collapse behavior are comprehensively
   summarized and critically reviewed based on the experimental results
   from the literature. The soil mechanics-based approaches proposed based
   on the experimental results of both compacted soils and natural loess
   soils are reviewed highlighting their strengths and limitations for
   estimating the collapse behavior. Simpler soil mechanics-based
   approaches with less parameters or parameters that are easy-to-determine
   from conventional tests are suggested for future research to better
   understand the collapse behavior of natural loess soils. Such studies
   would be more valuable for use in conventional geotechnical engineering
   practice applications. (C) 2016 Institute of Rock and Soil Mechanics,

   under non-sterile conditions for 53 days with no detectable protozoa or

   contamination-free cultivation. The results show that the BCPBR equipped

   to maintain dissolved oxygen at a level of around 120\% air saturation,
   which was 32\% lower than that of the conventional BCPBR, which had no
   LOR. While similar biomass concentration and productivity were obtained
   in both systems, significantly higher lipid cell content and lipid
   productivity of microalgae were obtained in the latter, which was
   attributed to the low dO(2) in culture due to enhanced deoxygenation

Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{47-56}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Vehicular Cloud Computing is a growing research field which consolidates
   the benefit of cloud computing into vehicular ad hoc networks. However,
   few studies address vehicles as potential Virtual Machine hosts. Due to
   the rapidly changing environment of a vehicular cloud, a host can easily
   change or leave coverage. As such, Virtual Machine Management and
   Migration schemes are necessary to ensure cloud subscribers have a
   satisfactory level of access to the resources. This paper proposes
   several Vehicular Virtual Machine Migration (WMM) schemes: WMM-U
   (Uniform), WMM-LW (Least Workload), VVMM-MA (Mobility Aware) and MDWLAM
   (Mobility and Destination Workload Aware Migration). Their performance
   is evaluated with respect to a set of metrics through simulations with
   varying levels of vehicular traffic congestion, Virtual Machine sizes
   and levels of load restriction. The most advanced scheme (MDWLAM), takes
   into account, the workload and mobility of the original host as well as
   those of the potential destinations. By doing so a valid destination
   will both have time to receive the workload and migrate the new load
   when necessary. The behavior of various algorithms is compared and the
   MDWLAM has been shown to demonstrate best performance, exhibiting
   migration drop rates that are negligibly small. (C) 2016 Published by

Abstract = {{Porous hydrophobic polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) composite hollow fiber
   membranes were fabricated via phase inversion method by embedding
   different amounts of hydrophobic calcium carbonate (CaCO3)
   nano-particles in the polymer matrix. The effects of nano-particle
   loadings on the morphology, structure and performance of the spun
   membranes in gas-liquid contactors were investigated. The incorporation
   of hydrophobic nano-particles into the polymer network enabled the
   formation of more abundant and narrower finger-like pores in the
   composite membranes compared to plain PVDF membrane. Moreover, the
   addition of nano-particles enhanced the surface roughness, permeation
   rate, porosity and wettability resistance of the composite membranes.
   CO2 absorption performance of the fabricated membranes was evaluated via
   a gas-liquid membrane contactor system. The CO2 flux was improved to
   some extent by increasing the mixing ratio of CaCO3. Peak absorption

   flow rate was achieved when 20/100 weight ratio of CaCO3/PVDF was
   employed. However, further increase of the ratio resulted in a composite
   membrane with lower absorption performance than the other composite
   membranes. Moreover, a long-term stability study of the composite
   membrane with the best CO2 absorption flux showed no decline in
   performance in the initial 210 h of operation, indicating that the
   membrane possesses high potential for gas liquid contactor applications.

Abstract = {{Although alterations of polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane
   performance and properties in contactor applications are more severe at
   high temperature, to date, detailed information on the relationship
   between performance and properties with temperature is available. Hence,
   this study was undertaken to improve thermal stability of PVDF membranes
   by montmorillonite (MMT) incorporation. The fabricated membranes were
   operated in a closed contactor loop with water temperature of either 27
   degrees C or 80 degrees C, followed by measuring CO2 absorption flux
   before and after 2 days exposure. Higher partial pore wetting at
   elevated temperature resulted in performance reduction of 31\% and 13\%
   for plain PVDF and 5 wt\% MMT-filled PVDF membrane (MMM hollow fiber),
   respectively. To determine the reasons, the membranes were immersed in
   water of 80 degrees C for 7 days and analyzed by analytical
   characterization methods after drying. It was revealed from FESEM images
   that large pores on the membrane surfaces became larger while the small
   pores became smaller, leading porous membrane surfaces to deform to semi
   dense layers with small number of large pores. Furthermore, strong
   reductions in membrane gas permeance, porosity, contact angle and
   wetting resistance were detected after 7-day immersion. Therefore,
   changes in the absorbent-induced membrane properties were found to be
   the reasons of the flux reduction at high operation temperatures. The
   alterations were, however, less pronounced for PVDF-filled MMT membrane
   than the original PVDF indicating thermal stability enhancement effect
   of the embedded clay particles. The results suggest that the
   impregnation of polymeric membranes by hydrophobic inorganic particles
   can be an effective method to stabilize the performance and properties
   of PVDF hollow fibers at harsh contactor operating conditions. (C) 2016

Title = {{Hiding depth information in compressed 2D image/video using reversible
   watermarking}},
Journal = {{MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{75}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel joint coding scheme is proposed for 3D media
   content including stereo images and multiview-plus-depth (MVD) video for
   the purpose of depth information hiding. The depth information is an
   image or image channel which reveals the distance of scene objects'
   surfaces from a viewpoint. With the concern of copyright protection,
   access control and coding efficiency for 3D content, we propose to hide
   the depth information into the texture image/video by a reversible
   watermarking algorithm called Quantized DCT Expansion (QDCTE).
   Considering the crucial importance of depth information for
   depth-image-based rendering (DIBR), full resolution depth image/video is
   compressed and embedded into the texture image/video, and it can be
   extracted without extra quality degradation other than compression
   itself. The reversibility of the proposed algorithm guarantees that
   texture image/video quality will not suffer from the watermarking
   process even if high payload (i.e. depth information) is embedded into
   the cover image/video. In order to control the size increase of
   watermarked image/video, the embedding function is carefully selected
   and the entropy coding process is also customized according to
   watermarking strength. Huffman and content-adaptive variable-length
   coding (CAVLC), which are respectively used for JPEG image and H.264
   video entropy encoding, are analyzed and customized. After depth
   information embedding, we propose a new method to update the entropy
   codeword table with high efficiency and low computational complexity
   according to watermark embedding strength. By using our proposed coding
   scheme, the depth information can be hidden into the compressed texture
   image/video with little bitstream size overhead while the quality
   degradation of original cover image/video from watermarking can be
   completely removed at the receiver side.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene and its related materials are important areas of research in
   recent years owing to their unique properties. The wide-range industrial
   application of graphene-related compounds has led to the development of
   novel and simple methods for the synthesis of graphene. In this paper,
   an environmentally friendly green synthesis for the partial reduction of
   graphene oxide (GO) to reduced GO (RGO) in a cost-effective single-step
   mechanism was reported. The method completely avoids the use of toxic
   and environmentally harmful reducing agents commonly used in the
   chemical reduction of GO to obtain RGO. The reduction of GO was carried
   out using aqueous leaf extracts of Paederia foetide L. The prepared GO
   and green RGO were characterized by ultraviolet-visible, Raman and
   Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopic analysis which showed a clear
   indication of the partial removal of oxygen-containing groups from the
   GO and the formation of RGO. The morphology of the green RGO was
   characterized by transmission electron and scanning electron microscopy.
   Dynamic light scattering was used for zeta potential measurement and
   correlated with the morphology of the sheets. Electrical conductivity
   was also measured to check the extent of reduction of GO to RGO.}},

Abstract = {{Many algorithms have been introduced to deterministically authenticate
   Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, while little work has been
   done to address scalability issue in batch authentications.
   Deterministic approaches verify tags one by one, and the communication
   overhead and time cost grow linearly with increasing size of tags. We
   design a fast and scalable counterfeits estimation scheme, INformative
   Counting (INC), which achieves sublinear authentication time and
   communication cost in batch verifications. The key novelty of INC builds
   on an FM-Sketch variant authentication synopsis that can capture key
   counting information using only sublinear space. With the help of this
   well-designed data structure, INC is able to provide authentication
   results with accurate estimates of the number of counterfeiting tags and
   genuine tags, while previous batch authentication methods merely provide
   0/1 results indicating the existence of counterfeits. We conduct
   detailed theoretical analysis and extensive experiments to examine this
   design and the results show that INC significantly outperforms previous
   work in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Sensing and alerting are fundamental to AAL. It is a long way from
   sensing to alerting, where lots of messages are interchanged among
   different processing units. Starting from the transfer of sensed data to
   the data processor and all the way to the alert generator, messages
   change in format, type, and size when intended for different
   stakeholders. Along this way, it becomes important to decide which
   messages to transfer, how to transfer, and when to transfer, taking into
   account the dependability requirements for a reliable AAL system. This
   article highlights AAL communication from various message transfer
   perspectives and proposes a general framework of alert/response in an
   AAL environment addressing these messaging requirements. The cornerstone
   of the proposed framework is the consideration of dependable RESTful
   communication throughout the message trail within a local and
   cloud-based environment. This is coupled with a publish-subscribe
   mechanism that offers a lightweight solution to address the variability
   of message transfers in AAL.}},

Abstract = {{Sterol glycosides (SG) are known to cause filter blocking problems in
   biodiesel use. The extraction and quantitative analysis of SG is
   difficult due to its low problematic concentration and its compatibility
   with biodiesel. The purpose of this study is to develop a method to
   quantify SG in FAME and biodiesel using gas chromatography and other
   equipment found in laboratories performing routine biodiesel analyses.
   SG was isolated from FAME using n-dodecane, acidification and cold
   soaking, followed by cold centrifugation at -8 to -15 A degrees C. The
   solids obtained were further separated by phase partition with a Folch
   wash, followed by a final n-dodecane rinse. This solution was analyzed
   by GC-FID using the operating conditions outlined in ASTM D6584. A
   calibration curve for SG was produced and a first order fit gave a value
   of r (2) = 0.992. Reproducibility tests were performed on soybean FAME
   and B100 canola biodiesel samples spiked with SG. The recovery of SG by
   the new method was found to be 99 \% for soy FAME with a standard
   deviation of 0.7 and 100 \% for B100 canola with a standard deviation of

Abstract = {{The ability of various statistical techniques to forecast the
   July-August-September (JAS) total rainfall and monthly streamflow in the
   Sirba watershed (West Africa) was tested. First, multiple linear
   regression was used to link predictors derived from the Atlantic and
   Pacific sea-surface temperatures (SST) to JAS rainfall in the watershed
   up to 18months ahead; then, daily precipitation was generated using
   temporal disaggregation; and finally, a rainfall-runoff model was used
   to generate future hydrographs. Different combinations of lag times and
   time windows on which SSTs were averaged were considered. Model
   performance was assessed using the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (E-f), the
   coefficient of determination (R-2) and a three-category hit score (H).
   The best results were achieved using the Pacific Ocean SST averaged over
   the March-June period of the year, before the rainy season, and led to a
   performance of R-2=0.458, E-f=0.387 and H=66.67\% for JAS total
   rainfall, and R-2=0.552, E-f=0.487 and H=73.28\% for monthly streamflow.}},

Abstract = {{A novel design of hybrid system consisting of photoreactor (PR) combined
   with ultrafiltration (UF) membrane was investigated for oily bilge water
   degradation and separation from oil tanker. Initially, the bilge organic
   compounds were photooxidized using ultraviolet type A (UVA) light
   irradiation on 100, 200 and 300 ppm of TiO2. Further TiO2 and oxidized
   oily bilge water was filtered using hollow fiber membrane separator,
   which was prepared by polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) and halloysite
   nanotubes. The hollow fiber membranes were characterized by ATR-IR
   spectrum, thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), X-ray diffraction (XRD),
   field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscope (XPS). Individual hydrocarbon of oily bilge
   water was identified by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (GC-MS) analysis. According to the GC-MS analysis, over 90\%
   decomposition of oil in bilge water has occurred by 200 and 300 ppm of
   TiO2 suspension. On the other hand, pH meter showed that, decomposed
   oily bilge water was more acidic, which increased to pH 7 after UF
   system process. Moreover, over 99\% of degraded oil in bilge water was
   filtered by this promising hybrid system. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

   interphase mass transfer rates are evaluated via the two-phase alkaline
   hydrolysis of 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-NPA) in a toluene-water biphasic
   system. The mass transfer rate increased 7-fold at the maximum tested
   oscillation of 5000 oscillatory-flow Reynolds number. The best
   application for the oscillatory-flow coil reactor is determined using a

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a novel vision-based detection system able to
   extend the detection range of vehicles or mobile robots. The proposed
   system is used to detect and track moving targets from near-to-far
   ranges and covers a wide range of more than 130 m without decreasing
   detection accuracy. Typical examples of targets include traffic signs,
   vehicles, animals, and pedestrians. In this paper, the detection and
   tracking of moving pedestrians from near-to-far ranges is investigated.
   The proposed system is composed of two identical cameras. The first
   camera is equipped with a short focal length lens to detect and track
   pedestrians in near-to-mid range, and the second camera with a long
   focal length lens is used to detect and track pedestrians in mid-to-far
   range. To synchronize the detection results of both cameras and to
   eliminate repeated measurements, two synchronization algorithms were
   developed. The tracking process is applied after the detection, and it
   is used to track and predict the future motion and direction of
   pedestrian. To prevent vehicle-target collisions, two algorithms that
   generate alert and danger warnings are developed. A mathematical model
   based on the fundamental physics of the camera and lens is developed to
   illustrate the feasibility of our work. Finally, we conducted many
   experiments in large open-air parking lots and on Ottawa roads to show
   the applicability of our system.}},

   Data sharing among nodes is described by a stochastic time-varying

   communication events between pairs of agents are modeled as Markov

Abstract = {{Fitting the measured bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) data to the Cole
   model and then extracting the Cole parameters is a common practice in
   BIS applications. The extracted Cole parameters then can be analysed as
   descriptors of tissue electrical properties. To have a better evaluation
   of physiological or pathological properties of biological tissue,
   accurate extraction of Cole parameters is of great importance. This
   paper proposes an improved Cole parameter extraction based on bacterial
   foraging optimization (BFO) algorithm. We employed simulated datasets to
   test the performance of the BFO fitting method regarding parameter
   extraction accuracy and noise sensitivity, and we compared the results
   with those of a least squares (LS) fitting method. The BFO method showed
   better robustness to the noise and higher accuracy in terms of extracted
   parameters. In addition, we applied our method to experimental data
   where bioimpedance measurements were obtained from forearm in three
   different positions of the arm. The goal of the experiment was to
   explore how robust Cole parameters are in classifying position of the
   arm for different people, and measured at different times. The extracted
   Cole parameters obtained by LS and BFO methods were applied to different
   classifiers. Two other evolutionary algorithms, GA and PSO were also
   used for comparison purpose. We showed that when the classifiers are fed
   with the extracted feature sets by BFO fitting method, higher accuracy
   is obtained both when applying on training data and test data.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being used in remote
   environment monitoring, security surveillance, military applications,
   and health monitoring systems among many other applications. Designing
   efficient localization techniques have been a major obstacle towards the
   deployment of WSN for these applications. In this paper, we present a
   novel lightweight iterative positioning (LIP) algorithm for next
   generation of wireless sensor networks, where we propose to resolve the
   localization problem through the following two phases: (1) initial
   position estimation and (2) iterative refinement. In the initial
   position estimation phase, instead of flooding the network with beacon
   messages, we propose to limit the propagation of the messages by using a
   random time-to-live for the majority of the beacon nodes. In the second
   phase of the algorithm, the nodes select random waiting periods for
   correcting their position estimates based on the information received
   from neighbouring nodes. We propose the use of Weighted Moving Average
   when the nodes have received multiple position corrections from a
   neighbouring node in order to emphasize the corrections with a high
   confidence. In addition, in the refinement phase, the algorithm employs
   low duty-cycling for the nodes that have low confidence in their
   position estimates, with the goal of reducing their impact on
   localization of neighbouring nodes and preserving their energy. Our
   simulation results indicate that LIP is not only scalable, but it is
   also capable of providing localization accuracy comparable to the Robust
   Positioning Algorithm, while significantly reducing the number of
   messages exchanged, and achieving energy savings.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic routing is a promising research area in the context of
   wireless network communications. Security and trustworthy of routing in
   this field, however, needs to be considerably researched. In this paper,
   a novel trust establishment algorithm is proposed, designed, and
   implemented specifically for opportunistic routing protocols which
   benefits from direct interactions between wireless nodes. The proposed
   trust model benefits from a novel watchdog mechanism considering not
   only forwarding behaviour of nodes but also the quality of links between
   them. Furthermore, three different metrics for next hop selection is
   introduced enabling nodes to select their next hop forwarders more
   sophisticatedly using quality of links, geographical location of nodes,
   and their trust level. Extensive simulation results represent that
   proposed model can significantly improve the performance of network
   communications when malicious nodes try to collapse the system.}},

Abstract = {{Biobutanol has attracted significant interest in recent decades and is
   seriously considered as a potential biofuel to partly replace gasoline.
   However, some production challenges must be addressed to make butanol
   economically viable such as the low product concentration and product
   toxicity inhibiting the microorganism. To alleviate these limitations,
   several in situ or ex situ separation techniques have been investigated
   in view of their integration to the biobutanol production process to
   enhance its economic viability. One of these techniques is adsorption
   which is one of the most energy-efficient techniques used for biobutanol
   separation. Considering the number of chemical species present in the
   ABE fermentation broth, it is essential to develop multicomponent
   adsorption isotherms for all components as a first step to design a high
   performance adsorption process. Few multicomponent isotherm models have
   been proposed such as multicomponent Langmuir and Freundlich. In this
   study, these two models as well as artificial neural networks were used
   to model the isotherms of each component in an ABE fermentation broth as
   a function of the equilibrium concentrations of all components for
   activated carbon F-400. Results showed that the multicomponent Langmuir
   model was not accurate due to the many simplifying assumptions. The
   multicomponent Freundlich and feedforward neural network (FFNN) isotherm
   models were able to predict the behavior of multicomponent systems very
   well. Indeed, the predictive model of the experimental data had a
   coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.97 and 0.99, for multicomponent
   Freundlich and FFNN isotherm models, respectively.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDRAULIC ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{River ice complicates river hydraulics and morphodynamics by adding a
   new boundary layer to the top of the flow. This boundary layer affects
   the velocity distribution throughout the depth due to increased flow
   resistance, and varies the local boundary shear stress on the bed (lower
   boundary) by adding new shear stress on the upper boundary (under
   surface of the ice). Variation of shear stress plays an important role
   in incipient motion of upper and lower boundary materials: sediment
   motion and transport are directly affected by local boundary shear
   stress, as are ice cover thickness, condition, and progression. This
   paper provides estimates of upper and lower boundary shear stress during
   stable ice cover and the important stage of ice cover breakup using
   available methods based on continuous field measurements of velocity
   profiles obtained with a bottom-mounted acoustic Doppler current
   profiler in the Nelson River, Canada. Boundary shear stresses varied
   dynamically with transformation of the ice cover, including the presence
   and removal of slush ice and formation of the ice jams. Estimated upper
   boundary shear stress varied between 0.52 and 23.87N/m2, whereas lower
   boundary shear stress varied between 1.51 and 2.40N/m2, with the highest
   values observed during breakup. These values are compared with estimates
   from previous laboratory experiments.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of ion-exchange resin for ammonia removal from aqueous

   resin was effective in removing ammonia from aqueous solution. Factorial
   design and response surface methodology were applied to evaluate and
   optimize the effects of pH, resin dose, contact time, temperature and
   initial ammonia concentration. Low pH condition was preferred with the
   optimum pH found to be 6. High resin dose generated high removal rate
   and low exchange capacity. Results of factorial design and response
   surface methodology showed that temperature was not a significant
   parameter. The model prediction was in good agreement with observed data
   (R-2 = 0.957). The optimum Q(e) was 28.78 mg/g achieved at pH = 6 and
   initial TAN concentration of 3000 mg/L. The kinetics followed the
   pseudo-second-order kinetic model (R-2 = 0.999). Equilibrium data were
   fitted to Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm models with Langmuir model
   providing a slightly better predication (R-2 = 0.996). The resin was

Abstract = {{In this work, polysulfone (PSf)/hydrous ferric oxide nanoparticles (HFO
   NPs) ultrafiltration mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) were prepared for
   adsorptive removal of lead (Pb) (II) from aqueous solution. The
   morphologies and physiochemical properties of prepared HFO NPs and MMMs
   were characterized using TEM, BET, XRD, FTIR, SEM, AFM, pure water flux
   analysis, contact angle measurement and membrane porosity analysis. The
   results revealed that the self-synthesized HFO NPs possessed' a specific
   surface area (SSA) of 233.49 m(2)/g. Increasing weight ratio of HFO NPs
   in PSf membranes significantly enhanced membrane pure water flux from
   229.5 L/m(2) h to 942.1 L/m(2) h, attributed by the improved membrane
   hydrophilicity (contact angle 8.0 degrees) coupled with greater surface
   roughness (74.8 nm) and overall porosity (88.8\%). Adsorption study
   showed that removal of Pb(II) was strongly dependent on pH in which the
   optimum pH was 6.5-7.0. Membrane M-1.5 (mass ratio of 1.5 HFO NPs:PSf)
   possessed the highest adsorption capacity of Pb(II) which was 13.2 mg/g.
   The adsorption mechanism of Pb(II) onto PSf/HFO MMMs was best fitted to
   Langmuir isotherm whereas the kinetic mechanism was best described by
   pseudo-second order model. The UF filtration study showed that this
   adsorptive MMMs produced permeate of high quality with Pb(II) content
   (<15 mu g/L). The recovery of 96\% demonstrated by the MMMs confirmed
   the superior potential of dual-function membrane for heavy metals
   removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING}},

Abstract = {{A novel and generic multi-objective design paradigm is proposed which
   utilizes quantum-behaved PSO (QPSO) for deciding the optimal
   configuration of the LQR controller for a given problem considering a
   set of competing objectives. There are three main contributions
   introduced in this paper as follows. (1) The standard QPSO algorithm is
   reinforced with an informed initialization scheme based on the simulated
   annealing algorithm and Gaussian neighborhood selection mechanism. (2)
   It is also augmented with a local search strategy which integrates the
   advantages of memetic algorithm into conventional QPSO. (3) An
   aggregated dynamic weighting criterion is introduced that dynamically
   combines the soft and hard constraints with control objectives to
   provide the designer with a set of Pareto optimal solutions and lets her
   to decide the target solution based on practical preferences. The
   proposed method is compared against a gradient-based method, seven
   meta-heuristics, and the trial-and-error method on two control
   benchmarks using sensitivity analysis and full factorial parameter
   selection and the results are validated using one-tailed T-test. The
   experimental results suggest that the proposed method outperforms
   opponent methods in terms of controller effort, measures associated with
   transient response and criteria related to steady-state. (C) 2015

Title = {{Rendezvous with constant memory}},
Journal = {{THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{621}},
Pages = {{57-72}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{We study the impact that persistent memory has on the classical
   rendezvous problem of two mobile computational entities, called robots,
   in the plane. It is well known that, without additional assumptions,
   rendezvous is impossible if the entities are oblivious (i.e., have no
   persistent memory) even if the system is semi-synchronous (SSYNCH). It
   has been recently shown that rendezvous is possible even if the system
   is asynchronous (ASYNCH) if each robot is endowed with O(1) bits of
   persistent memory, can transmit O(1) bits in each cycle, and can
   remember (i.e., can persistently store) the last received transmission.
   This setting is overly powerful.
   In this paper we weaken that setting in two different ways: (1) by
   maintaining the 0(1) bits of persistent memory but removing the
   communication capabilities, a setting we call finite-state (FSTATE); and
   (2) by maintaining the ability of transmitting 0(1) bits and remembering
   the last received message, but removing the ability of an agent to
   remember its previous activities, a setting we call finite-communication
   (FCOMM). Note that, even though its use is very different, in both
   settings, the amount of persistent memory of a robot is a constant
   number of bits.
   We investigate the rendezvous problem in these two weaker settings. We
   model both settings as a system of robots endowed with visible lights,
   each with a constant number of colors: in FSTATE, a robot can only see
   its own light, while in FCOMM a robot can only see the other robot's
   light. Among other things, we prove that, with rigid movements,
   finite-state robots can rendezvous in SSYNCH, and that
   finite-communication robots are able to rendezvous even in ASYNCH. All
   proofs are constructive: in each setting, we present a protocol that
   allows the two robots to rendezvous in finite time. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Carrier effects on tertiary nitrifying moving bed biofilm reactor: An

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly stricter ammonia and nitrogen release regulations with
   respect to wastewater effluents are creating a need for tertiary
   treatment systems. The moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) is being
   considered as an upgrade option for an increasing number of wastewater
   treatment facilities due to its small footprint and ease of operation.
   Despite the MBBRs creation as a system to remove nitrogen, recent
   research on MBBR systems showing that the system's performance is
   directly related to carrier surface area and is irrespective of carrier
   shape and type has been performed exclusively on chemical oxygen demand
   (COD) removal systems. Furthermore, the influence of carrier type on the
   solids produced by MBBR systems has also been exclusively studied for
   COD removal systems. This work investigates the effects of three
   specific carrier types on ammonia removal rates, biofilm morphology,
   along with solids production and settleability of tertiary nitrifying
   MBBR systems. The study concludes that carrier type has no significant
   effect on tertiary nitrifying MBBR system performance under steady,
   moderate loading conditions. The research does however highlight the
   propensity of greater surface area to volume carriers to become clogged
   under high loading conditions and that the high surface area carriers
   investigated in this study required longer adjustment periods to changes
   in loading after becoming clogged.}},

   biofilm across carrier type and loading}},
Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{235-243}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{This study investigates the effects of three specific moving bed biofilm
   reactor (MBBR) carrier types and two surface area loading rates on
   biofilm thickness, morphology and bacterial community structure of post
   carbon removal nitrifying MBBR systems along with the effects of carrier
   type and loading on ammonia removal rates and effluent solids
   settleability. The meso and micro analyses show that the AOB kinetics
   vary based on loading condition, but irrespective of carrier type. The
   meso-scale response to increases in loading was shown to be an increase
   in biofilm thickness with higher surface area carriers being more
   inclined to develop and maintain thicker biofilms. The pore spaces of
   these higher surface area to volume carriers also demonstrated the
   potential to become clogged at higher loading conditions. Although the
   biofilm thickness increased during higher loading conditions, the
   relative percentages of both the embedded viable and non-viable cells at
   high and conventional loading conditions remained stable; indicating
   that the reduced ammonia removal kinetics observed during carrier
   clogging events is likely due to the observed reduction in the surface
   area of the attached biofilm. Microbial community analyses demonstrated
   that the dominant ammonia oxidizing bacteria for all carriers is
   Nitrosomonas while the dominant nitrite oxidizing bacteria is
   Nitrospira. The research showed that filamentous species were abundant
   under high loading conditions, which likely resulted in the observed
   reduction in effluent solids settleability at high loading conditions as
   opposed to conventional loading conditions. Although the settleability
   of the effluent solids was correlated to increases in abundances of
   filamentous organisms in the biofilm, analyzed using next generation
   sequencing, the ammonia removal rate was not shown to be directly
   correlated to specific meso or micro-scale characteristics. Instead post
   carbon removal MBBR ammonia removal kinetics were shown to be related to
   the viable AOB cell coverage of the carriers; which was calculated by
   normalizing the surface area removal rate by the biofilm thickness, the
   bacterial percent abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria and the
   percentage of viable cells. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work amorphous FeC films were deposited on thin sheets of
   interstitial free steel using physical vapor deposition. Annealing
   treatments were then carried out to diffuse C from the coating into the

   increase with annealing temperature from similar to 120 MPa at 25
   degrees C up to a maximum of 300 MPa at 630 degrees C without any
   significant loss of ductility. At 710 degrees C, a decrease in yield
   strength was related to the coarsening of carbides inside the IF steel
   (confirmed by atom probe tomography), and the associated reduction in
   the matrix solid solution carbon concentration (confirmed by
   thermoelectric power measurements). The through-thickness carbon
   diffusion profile was predicted using Fick's law and validated by Knoop
   hardness measurements. Yield strength predictions were accurate if the
   crystallization of the FeC film was taken into account as it controls

Abstract = {{Let q be a prime power and F-q be the finite field with q elements. A
   q-ary m-sequence is a linear recurrence sequence of elements from F-q
   with the maximum possible period. A covering array CA(N; t, k, v) of
   strength t is a N x k array with entries from an alphabet of size v,
   with the property that any N x m subarray has at least one row equal to
   every possible m-tuple of the alphabet. The covering array number CAN
   (t, k, v) is the minimum number N such that a CA(N; t, k, v) exists.
   Finding upper bounds for covering array numbers is one of the most
   important questions in this research area. Raaphorst, Moura and Stevens
   give a construction for covering arrays of strength 3 using m-sequences
   that improves upon some previous best bounds for covering array numbers.
   In this paper we introduce a method that generalizes this construction
   to strength greater than or equal to 4. Our implementation of this
   method returned new covering arrays and improved upon 38 previously best
   known covering array numbers. The new covering arrays are given here by
   listing the essential elements of their construction. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The application of microwave (MW) radiation followed by aeration (A) for
   the purpose of ammonia removal from both synthetic solutions and
   landfill leachate was investigated in this study. 100 mL of synthetic
   solution or landfill leachate was subjected to MW radiation for 30, 45,
   60, 90 and 120 s under 50 and 100\% power output level and a pH of
   10,10.5 and 11. The samples were then aerated for 10 min. The initial,
   after MW application and final total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) were
   measured. Results confirmed that the sequential microwave/aeration
   process was an effective approach for removal of ammonia from aqueous
   systems. Maximum ammonia removal of 81.7\% for 100 mL synthetic solution
   and 70\% for 100 mL landfill leachate was achieved by applying 78 KJ
   microwave energy output and 10 min aeration. Factorial design and
   response surface methodology were applied to evaluate and optimize the
   effects of pH, MW energy level and microwave power output. When applying
   the same energy output to the batch tests, the effect of varying MW
   power output is negligible. For 100 mL synthetic ammonia solution, the
   optimum pH and MW energy output level for ammonia removal were 11 and 78
   KJ and the maximum ammonia removal efficiency predicted for the
   synthetic solution is 76.3\%. R-2 of 0.941 indicates that the observed
   results fitted well with the model prediction. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

   hip in patients with bilateral cam-type deformities}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{33}},
Pages = {{13-19}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Background: It is still unclear why many individuals with bilateral cam
   deformities demonstrate only unilateral symptoms of femoroacetabular
   impingement, thus symptoms may be attributed to additional anatomical
   parameters. The purpose was to examine patients with bilateral cam
   deformities, with unilateral symptoms, and compare anatomical hip joint
   parameters between their affected (symptomatic) hip and their
   contralateral, unaffected (asymptomatic) hip.
   Methods: Twenty participants (n = 20) with unilateral symptoms, but
   bilateral cam deformities, underwent CT imaging to measure their
   affected and unaffected hip's: axial and radial alpha angles, femoral
   head-neck offset, femoral neck-shaft angle, medial proximal femoral
   angle, femoral torsion, acetabular version, center-edge angle; and a
   physical examination (hip flexion, straight-leg raise, internal
   rotation, external rotation) to ascertain clinical signs.
   Findings: The affected hips demonstrated limited motions during physical
   examination, compared with unaffected hips (effect size = 0.550 to
   0.955). The affected hips had significantly lower femoral neck-shaft
   angles (mean 125 degrees (SD 3)) and lower medial proximal femoral
   angles (mean 79 degrees (SD 4)), compared with the unaffected hips (mean
   127 degrees (SD 3), P = 0.001, effect size = 0.922; and mean 81 degrees
   (SD 4), P = 0.011, effect size = 0.632; respectively). There were no
   differences in cam deformity parameters (axial and radial alpha angles,
   femoral head-neck offset), femoral torsion, acetabular version, and
   center-edge angle, between affected and unaffected hips.
   Interpretation: A decreased femoral neck-shaft angle or medial proximal
   femoral angle can be implemented as a diagnostic predictor, to determine
   which hip may be at a greater risk of developing early symptoms. (C)

Abstract = {{Networks that lack continuous end-to-end connections among their nodes
   due to node mobility, constrained power sources, or limited data storage
   space are called DTNs. To overcome the intermittent connectivity, DTN
   nodes store and carry the data packets they receive until they come into
   communication range of each other. In addition, they spread multiple
   copies of the same packet on the network to increase the delivery
   probability. In recent years, several routing protocols have been
   developed specifically for DTNs. These protocols vary in the number of
   copies they spread and the information they use to guide the packets to
   their destinations. There have been some reviews of those protocols, but
   no performance comparison has been conducted. In this article, we study
   four well-known DTN routing protocols: EPIDEMIC, Spray-and-Wait,
   PROPHET, and MAXPROP. We introduce a procedural form to present the
   protocols. We measure the performance of the protocols in terms of
   packet delivery, delivery cost, and average packet delay. We compare the
   protocols' performance together with the results of optimal routing
   using real-life scenarios of vehicles and pedestrians roaming in a city.
   We conduct several simulation experiments to show the impact of changing
   buffer capacity, packet lifetime, packet generation rate, and number of
   nodes on the performance metrics. The article is concluded by providing
   guidelines to develop an efficient DTN routing protocol. To the best of
   our knowledge, this work is the first to provide a detailed performance
   comparison among the diverse collection of DTN routing protocols.}},

Abstract = {{The measurement of noise exposure from communication headsets poses a
   methodological challenge. Although several standards describe methods
   for general noise measurements in occupational settings, these are not
   directly applicable to noise assessments under communication headsets.
   For measurements under occluded ears, specialized methods have been
   specified by the International Standards Organization (ISO 11904) such
   as the microphone in a real ear and manikin techniques. Simpler methods
   have also been proposed in some national standards such as the use of
   general purpose artificial ears and simulators in conjunction with
   single number corrections to convert measurements to the equivalent
   diffuse field. However, little is known about the measurement agreement
   between these various methods and the acoustic manikin technique. Twelve
   experts positioned circum-aural, supra-aural and insert communication
   headsets on four different measurement setups (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3.3
   artificial ears, and acoustic manikin). Fit-refit measurements of four
   audio communication signals were taken under quiet laboratory
   conditions. Data were transformed into equivalent diffuse-field sound
   levels using third-octave procedures. Results indicate that the Type 1
   artificial ear is not suited for the measurement of sound exposure under
   communication headsets, while Type 2 and Type 3.3 artificial ears are in
   good agreement with the acoustic manikin technique. Single number
   corrections were found to introduce a large measurement uncertainty,
   making the use of the third-octave transformation preferable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a very efficient, integrated framework for seismic
   analyses of long-span cable-stayed bridges. The efficiency comes from
   the dramatic reduction in formation time and the degrees of freedom
   (DOF) associated with the structure, using the integrated finite strip
   method (IFSM) along with the application of a very robust and efficient
   time history method (THM) using the Newmark scheme for dynamic analysis
   of the bridge structure. The previous versions of the finite strip
   method are limited to modeling the bridge deck only, whereas other
   structural components are replaced by assumed boundary conditions. Using
   the IFSM, all components of the long-span cable-stayed bridge can be
   modeled in a unified system, and consequently, the real dynamic behavior
   including the interactions between deck, piers, and cables can be
   perfectly considered. To verify the solution, the geometric and dynamic
   properties of the Kap Shui Mun (KSM) Bridge, as a real example of a
   long-span cable-stayed bridge, are derived by the proposed finite strip
   method. Then, the seismic response of KSM Bridge under uniform and
   nonuniform earthquake loadings is investigated by using the THM. The
   results show that the IFSM can be applied successfully for seismic
   analysis of long-span cable-stayed bridges, and the analysis can be
   performed in a minimal amount of time.}},

Abstract = {{The Urban Rapid Assessment Tool (RAT) integrates recent advances in
   virtual environments and mobile smart devices to facilitate the rapid
   visual screening (RVS) of building structural parameters outlined in
   FEMA 154 and FEMA 310. These advanced parameters support Tier-1 and
   Tier-2 earthquake loss estimations in programs such as Hazus and
   CanRisk. Urban RAT includes two software components that use a common
   database schema: Urban RAT Desktop integrates the virtual environment of
   Street View within the geographic information system ArcGIS and, Urban
   RAT mobile, an equivalent on-site data collection application for the
   Android operating system. Structural parameters observed on a sample of
   113 buildings using both Urban RAT Desktop and Urban RAT Mobile show
   significant agreement. As such, virtual assessment is a viable proxy for
   field-based RVS, making Urban RAT effective and efficient for rapid
   structural data collection to support detailed loss estimation studies
   in urban regions. Developed and tested during 2011-2013, the advantages
   of the Urban RAT tool are defined and discussed in the context of
   traditional sidewalk surveys and contrasted with other existing data

Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{965-986}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Use case map (UCM) is a modeling language designed to bridge the gap
   between requirements and high-level design artifacts. UCM graphical
   models describe functional requirements as scenarios using a structure
   of components. UCM specifies multiple scenarios abstractly in a single
   integrated view that facilitates understanding of the system-to-be and
   the early detection of inconsistent scenarios. However, once
   requirements have been expressed as scenarios, unified modeling language
   (UML) sequence diagrams are suitable for developing and presenting the
   details of interactions and help in the transition to a more formal
   level of refinement. Typically, system analysts are responsible for this
   transition, and they usually perform it manually, which makes subsequent
   design models prone to mistakes. As a result, system analysts may design
   an application that does not accurately realize the behavior specified
   in UCMs. There is therefore a need to develop a technique to transform
   UCM models to UML design artifacts. UML sequence diagrams are one of the
   most popular UML artifacts for dynamic modeling. In this paper, we
   present a model transformation approach from UCM notation to a UML
   sequence diagram to facilitate the transition from requirements to
   high-level design artifacts. We also present an application of the
   proposed model transformation to an elevator control system.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced knowledge of the effect of the initial temperatures of cemented
   paste backfill (CPB) on its strength development and self-desiccation
   ability is needed to provide a rational basis for mixture proportioning
   as well as the cost-effective design of CPB structures and speeding up
   of the mining cycle. An experimental testing and monitoring program has
   been undertaken to determine the influence of various initial
   temperatures (2 degrees C, 20 degrees C, 35 degrees C and 50 degrees C)
   on the strength development and evolution of the self-desiccation
   (measured by the volumetric water content and suction) of the CPB that
   contains sodium silicate as the admixture (S-CPB) at early ages (up 28
   days). The evolution of the temperature, electrical conductivity (gives
   information about the cement hydration progress), volumetric water
   content and suction of S-CPB samples with the specified initial
   temperatures have been monitored for 28 days. Moreover, mechanical tests
   and microstructural analyses are performed on these S-CPB specimens
   after specific curing times (6 h, 1 day, 3 days, 7 days and 28 days).
   The results obtained show that the initial backfill temperature has a
   significant influence on the curing temperature of S-CPB, its strength
   development and self-desiccation. Furthermore, the results reveal that
   the temperature-time history, cement hydration, self-desiccation and
   strength development of S-CPB are strongly coupled. The initial SCPB and
   these couplings should be taken into account for a safe and economical
   design of S-CPB structures and the speeding up of mining cycles. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{150}},
Pages = {{42-53}},

Abstract = {{This work compares and predicts the response of roof edge components to
   wind load. The edge components consist of three different parapet coping
   configurations on the edge of a commercial building's roof system.
   Full-scale highly non-Gaussian data acquired on a low-rise building is
   used for analysis. The comparison shows that strong suction is observed
   on the front flashing of all configurations, contrarily to what is
   specified in building codes. The prediction of the edge component
   response to wind load is accomplished with both a Gumbel distribution
   model and a translation method recently proposed in the literature,
   which estimate the extreme value distribution of the pressure
   coefficient. A Gumbel model is commonly used to represent the
   distribution of the peak pressure coefficient. The model parameters are
   determined from observed peaks, defining the Gumbel method. Recent work
   has proposed an alternative, the translation method, using the pressure
   coefficient entire time history instead, modeled as a translation from a
   Gaussian random process. Major gains include accurate and stable
   performance for strongly non-Gaussian data. The present results show
   that the translation method produces a more realistic estimate of the
   peak pressure coefficient distribution than the Gumbel method. (C) 2016

   cemented paste backfill}},
Journal = {{CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the sulphate
   effect on the early age (1, 3, 7 and 28 days) strength and
   self-desiccation of cemented paste backfill (CPB). The CPB specimens
   have an initial sulphate concentration of 0, 5000, 15,000 and 25,000 ppm
   and are cured at room temperature (20 degrees C). Tests on the
   mechanical properties were conducted on the CPB, while microstructural
   analyses were performed on the CPB and cement paste samples. Suction and
   electrical conductivity monitoring were also performed on the CPB
   specimens with different sulphate contents. The results show that
   sulphate has a significant effect on the early age strength and
   self-desiccation of CPB. In the early ages, sulphate can have negative
   effects, i.e., leads to a decrease in the CPB strength and reduction in
   the intensity and rate of self-desiccation within the CPB. The magnitude
   of these effects depends on the initial sulphate concentration. The
   inhibition of cement hydration by sulphate ions is a key reason for the
   observed decrease in CPB strength and self-desiccation intensity or
   rate. Ettringite formation, changes in the pore structure and sulphate
   absorption by C-S-H are found as additional negative factors that affect
   CPB strength. This study has demonstrated that the effect of sulphate on
   the early strength and self-desiccation of CPB is an important factor
   for consideration in the designing of cost-effective, safe and durable
   CPB structures as well as for reducing the mining cycle time; in other
   words, increasing mining productivity. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Geotechnical Response of Compost Biocover Columns under Freeze-Thaw
   Conditions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COLD REGIONS ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Biocovers are a promising technology for mitigating methane (CH4)
   emission from landfills. The geotechnical performance of the biocover
   material is one of the design criteria of biocovers. However, current
   understanding of the geotechnical behavior of biocovers under
   freeze-thaw conditions is limited. In the present paper, the effects of
   freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) on the geotechnical (thermal, hydraulic, and
   mechanical) properties of compost-based biocovers are investigated by
   column experiments. In the experiments, three columns are developed,
   prepared, and treated by a period of methane injection (0 FTCs) after 1
   FTC and 2 FTCs in three respective stages. In addition, extensive
   laboratory testing is carried out on the biocover samples with regard to
   their thermal (thermal conductivity); hydraulic (hydraulic
   conductivity); and mechanical (compressibility and shear strength) and
   physical properties (e.g., grain size distribution, moisture content).
   The results show that the FTCs induced changes in a number of the
   geotechnical properties of the biocover. However, these changes are
   mostly located in the top layer of the biocover (0-15 cm). It was found
   that FTCs significantly increased the hydraulic conductivity of the top
   layer of the biocover, whereas they slightly decreased the thermal
   conductivity of this layer. As for mechanical and physical factors, the
   average grain size of the compost surface slightly decreased throughout
   the stages, while the friction angles of the bottom and middle layers of
   the compost-based biocover were not significantly affected. The results
   presented in this paper will contribute to better design of landfill
   biocovers in cold regions. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Intelligent bearing fault signature extraction via iterative oscillatory
   behavior based signal decomposition (IOBSD)}},
Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{40-55}},
Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{A typical vibration signal from a defective bearing is composed of
   fault-induced transients (i.e., fault signature), resonance, multiple
   vibration interferences and background noise. Extracting the
   fault-induced transients from such signals is the primary goal for
   bearing fault diagnosis. This paper proposes an intelligent oscillatory
   behavior based signal decomposition (OBSD) method for this purpose. The
   OBSD technique exploits both the signal separation capability of
   morphological component analysis (MCA) and the basis creation potential
   of tunable Q-factor wavelet transform (TQWT). To generate proper bases
   for each individual signal component, the Q-factor determination and
   tuning strategies for the TQWT are developed in this study. In the
   presence of multiple interferences, one-time OBSD may not be sufficient
   to extract fault feature successfully. As such, an iterative OBSD
   (IOBSD) procedure is proposed. With the proposed method, a vibration
   signal can be decomposed into three signal components, i.e.,
   low-oscillation component (fault signature presenting non-oscillation),
   high-oscillation component (interferences manifesting sustained
   oscillation) and residual (noise), according to their oscillatory
   behaviors. Bearing faults can then be reliably detected. The main
   features of the proposed method include: (1) it can remove in-band
   interference and noise that cannot be removed by the widely used
   frequency-based approaches, as it is frequency-independent in nature,
   (2) it can extract fault signatures from heavily interference-obscured
   signals without filtering the signals, and (3) it does not require the
   prior information of the signals. With these features, the IOBSD method
   can substantially reduce human involvement and facilitate its
   implementation in a fault detection expert system, particularly in an
   environment with various interferences. The IOBSD method has been
   favorably compared with one of the popular filtering techniques, i.e.,
   SK method. The effectiveness of the proposed method has also been tested
   by simulation and experiments. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Elevation of operating pressure in gas-solid fluidized beds affects the
   bed hydrodynamics, which in turn could affect the extent of bed
   electrification and reactor wall coating due to electrostatic charge
   generation. In this work, a pilot plant high-pressure gas-solid
   fluidization system housing the Faraday cup electrostatic charge
   measurement technique is introduced in order to study the underlying
   mechanism of electrostatic charge generation causing fluidized bed wall
   fouling at pressures up to 25 barg. A previously developed on-line
   electrostatic charge measurement technique containing two Faraday cups
   was successfully implemented in the high-pressure system. The effect of
   operating pressure on gas-solid fluidized bed electrification was
   examined under operating pressures of 0 and 25 bar (gauge) by fluidizing
   polyethylene resin directly received from a commercial reactor.
   Experimental results showed that the magnitude of reactor wall coating
   increased with the increase of operating pressure. The wall coating
   contained positively as well as negatively charged particles indicating
   the occurrence of bipolar charging within the fluidized bed. Finally,
   based on the experimental results obtained in this work the mechanism of
   fluidized bed column wall coating formation was discussed. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Calcium looping is a post-combustion carbon capture technology which
   uses natural limestone as a sorbent. The carrying capacity of the
   natural limestone, as a CO2 sorbent, decays with each
   calcination/carbonation cycle. Steam has been shown to decrease the
   carrying capacity decay and can also be used to reactivate spent
   sorbent. A testing campaign with continuous CO2 capture and various
   levels of steam in the oxy-fired calciner was completed in a 100 kW(th)
   dual-fluidized bed pilot plant. The calciner was operated with steam
   concentrations of 0 vol.\%, 15 vol.\% and 65 vol.\% at the inlet of the
   windbox and at 850 degrees C and 910 degrees C at the highest steam
   concentration. The increase in steam in the calcinet decreased the fresh
   sorbent make-up requirement; for instance a 78\% reduction in the
   make-up was required with 65 vol.\% steam in the calciner relative to
   the no-steam case. Reducing the temperature of calcination with 65
   vol.\% steam did not further reduce the make-up requirement The
   decreased decay in sorbent carrying capacity was attributed to a stable
   pore structure resulting from the increase in steam concentration and
   the corresponding reduction of the CO2 concentration in the calciner.
   The reduced CO2-induced sintering resulted in an increased surface area
   and pore volume which was stable over many calcination/carbonation
   cycles. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Evaluation of Microflow Digital Imaging Particle Analysis for
   Sub-Visible Particles Formulated with an Opaque Vaccine Adjuvant}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 29}},
Abstract = {{Microflow digital imaging (MDI) has become a widely accepted method for
   assessing sub-visible particles in pharmaceutical formulations however,
   to date; no data have been presented on the utility of this methodology
   when formulations include opaque vaccine adjuvants. This study evaluates
   the ability of MDI to assess sub-visible particles under these
   conditions. A Fluid Imaging Technologies Inc. FlowCAM1 instrument was
   used to assess a number of sub-visible particle types in solution with
   increasing concentrations of AddaVax, a nanoscale squalene-based
   adjuvant. With the objective (10X) used and the limitations of the
   sensor resolution, the instrument was incapable of distinguishing
   between sub-visible particles and AddaVax T droplets at particle sizes
   less than 5 mu m. The instrument was capable of imaging all particle
   types assessed (polystyrene beads, borosilicate glass, cellulose,
   polyethylene protein aggregate mimics, and lysozyme protein aggregates)
   at sizes greater than 5 mu m in concentrations of AddaVax T up to 50\%
   (vol: vol). Reduced edge gradients and a decrease in measured particle
   sizes were noted as adjuvant concentrations increased. No significant
   changes in particle counts were observed for polystyrene particle
   standards and lysozyme protein aggregates, however significant
   reductions in particle counts were observed for borosilicate (80\% of
   original) and cellulose (92\% of original) particles. This reduction in
   particle counts may be due to the opaque adjuvant masking translucent
   particles present in borosilicate and cellulose samples. Although the
   results suggest that the utility of MDI for assessing sub-visible
   particles in high concentrations of adjuvant may be highly dependent on
   particle morphology, we believe that further investigation of this
   methodology to assess sub-visible particles in challenging formulations
   is warranted.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrophobic anticancer drug, raloxifene hydrochloride (RH) is
   intercalated into a series of magnesium aluminum layered double
   hydroxides (LDHs) with various charge density anions through ion
   exchange technique for controlled drug delivery. The particle nature of
   the LDH in presence of drug is determined through electron microscopy
   and surface morphology. The release of drug from the RH intercalated
   LDHs was made very fast or sustained by altering the exchangeable anions
   followed by the modified Freundlich and parabolic diffusion models. The
   drug release rate is explained from the interactions between the drug
   and LDHs along with order-disorder structure of drug intercalated LDHs.
   Nitrate bound LDH exhibits greater interaction with drug and sustained
   drug delivery against the loosely interacted phosphate bound LDH-drug,
   which shows fast release. Cell viability through MTT assay suggests drug
   intercalated LDHs as better drug delivery vehicle for cancer cell line
   against poor bioavailability of the pure drug. In vivo study with mice
   indicates the differential tumor healing which becomes fast for greater
   drug release system but the body weight index clearly hints at damaged
   organ in the case of fast release system. Histopathological experiment
   confirms the damaged liver of the mice treated either with pure drug or
   phosphate bound LDH-drug, fast release system, vis-a-vis normal liver
   cell morphology for sluggish drug release system with steady healing
   rate of tumor. These observations clearly demonstrate that nitrate bound
   LDH nanoparticle is a potential drug delivery vehicle for anticancer
   drugs without any side effect. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{In this study, a low-loss and compact planar power combiner for solid
   state power amplifiers (SSPAs) is proposed. It combines eight power
   amplifier modules with low insertion loss (IL) and high reliability by
   utilising a novel magic-Tee configuration and E-plane bend along with a
   suitable microstrip-to-waveguide transition. The fabricated prototype
   was implemented through automatic milling machines to produce three
   planar layers that form the final structure. This novel approach enabled
   precise fabrication, simple assembly of the SSPAs as well as low-cost
   manufacturing in comparison with existing traditional approaches. This
   process is suitable for SSPAs operating from 4 to 40 GHz. The combined
   IL of the implemented combiner network is less than 0.6 dB at Ka-band,
   0.5 dB at Ku-band, and 0.4 dB at X-band while exhibiting a 10\%
   fractional bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{The fluorescent dye DAPI is useful for its association with and
   consequent amplification of an similar to 460 nm emission maximum upon
   binding to dsDNA. Labelling with higher DAPI concentrations is a
   technique used to reveal Pi polymers {[}polyphosphate (polyP)], with a
   red-shift to similar to 520-550 nm fluorescence emission. DAPI-polyP
   emissions of similar to 580 nm are also generated upon 415 nm
   excitation. Red-shifted DAPI emission has been associated with polyP and
   RNA and has more recently been reported with polyadenylic acid (polyA),
   specific inositol phosphates (IPs) and heparin. We find that amorphous
   calcium phosphate (ACP) also demonstrates red-shifted DAPI emission at
   high DAPI concentrations. This DAPI spectral shift has been attributed
   to DAPI-DAPI electrostatic interactions enabled by molecules with high
   negative charge density that increase the local DAPI concentration and
   favour DAPI molecular proximity, as observed by increasing the
   dye/phosphate ratio. Excitation of dry DAPI (similar to 360 nm)
   confirmed a red-shifted DAPI emission. Whereas enzymatic approaches to
   modify substrates can help define the nature of DAPI fluorescence
   signals, multiple approaches beyond red-shifted DAPI excitation/emission
   are advised before conclusions are drawn about DAPI substrate
   identification.}},

Abstract = {{A symmetrical radio over a colorless wavelength-division multiplexing
   passive optical network with wavelength reuse based on polarization
   multiplexing and coherent detection incorporating digital phase noise
   cancellation is proposed and experimentally demonstrated. For the
   downlink, two optical signals are intensity modulated by two different
   16-QAM downstream microwave vector signals that are polarization
   multiplexed at the optical line terminal (OLT). Then, the two
   orthogonally polarized optical signals are transmitted to the optical
   network unit (ONU). At the ONU, one of the two orthogonally polarized
   optical signals is selected to be reused for the uplink transmission.
   Then, the reused optical signal is split into two channels by a 3-dB
   coupler. One portion of the reused optical signal is phase modulated by
   a 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signal, while the other portion is
   intensity modulated by another 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signal.
   Again, the two portions of the optical signals are polarization
   multiplexed and transmitted back to the OLT. At the OLT, a coherent
   receiver with a digital signal processing (DSP) unit is used to detect
   the upstream optical signals. Two DSP algorithms are developed to
   recover the two 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signals. The
   transmission of two 2.5-Gb/s 16-QAM downstream microwave vector signals
   and two 2.5-Gb/s 16-QAM upstream microwave vector signals over a 10.5-km
   single-mode fiber is experimentally demonstrated. The error vector
   magnitudes for both the down and upstream transmissions are measured to
   be 7.3\% and 8.65\%, which are good enough to achieve error-free
   transmission with forward error correction.}},

Title = {{Predicting Modulation in Corticomotor Excitability and in Transcallosal
   Inhibition in Response to Anodal Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Responses to neuromodulatory protocols based either on
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) or transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) are known to be highly variable between individuals.
   In this study, we examined whether variability of responses to anodal
   tDCS (a-tDCS) could be predicted from individual differences in the
   ability to recruit early or late indirect waves (I-waves), as reflected
   in latency differences of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) evoked by TMS
   of different coil orientation.
   Methods: Participants (n = 20) first underwent TMS to measure latency of
   MEPs elicited at different coil orientations (i.e., PA,
   posterior-anterior; AP, anterior-posterior; LM, latero-medial). Then,
   participants underwent a-tDCS (20 min @ 2 mA) targeting the primary
   motor cortex of the contralateral preferred hand (right, n = 18).
   Individual responses to a-tDCS were determined by monitoring changes in
   MEP amplitude at rest and in the duration of the contralateral silent
   period (cSP) and ipsilateral silent period (iSP) during contraction; the
   latter providing an index of the latency and duration of transcallosal
   inhibition (LTI and DTI).
   Results: Consistent with previous reports, individual responses to
   a-tDCS were highly variable when expressed in terms of changes in MEP
   amplitude or in cSP duration with similar to 50\% of the participants
   showing either little or no modulation. In contrast, individual
   variations in measures of transcallosal inhibition were less variable,
   allowing detection of significant after-effects. The reduced LTI and
   prolonged DTI observed post-tDCS were indicative of an enhanced
   excitability of the transcallosal pathway in the stimulated hemisphere.
   In terms of predictions, AP-LM latency differences proved to be good
   predictors of responses to a-tDCS when considering MEP modulation.
   Conclusion: The present results corroborate the predictive value of
   latency differences derived from TMS to determine who is likely to
   express-canonical{''} responses to a-tDCS in terms of MEP modulation.
   The results also provide novel suggestive evidencethat a-tDCS can
   modulate the excitability of the transcallosal pathway of the stimulated
   hemisphere.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, treatment of spent wash from distilleries was
   studied using graphene oxide (GO) flakes incorporated in
   polyethersulfone (PES) mixed matrix membranes (MMMs). Two different
   additives such as polyacrylic acid (PAA) and lithium chloride (LiCl)
   were also used separately in the casting dope solution of PES/GO. GO TEM
   analysis revealed that particles are wrinkled sheets-like multilayer
   structure. Multilayer structures exhibit better intercalate with polymer
   matrix to produce hybrid nanocomposite membranes. The TGA analysis has
   shown that GO has good miscibility in PES membrane. Water flux has been
   improved progressively for the additive combined GO incorporated PES
   MMMs. Further, contact angle value of the neat PES membrane showed 70.8
   degrees which was significantly reduced up to 58.4 degrees for
   PES/GO/PAA membrane. This ensures that membrane surface hydrophilicity
   was improved considerably due to the existence of both groups, GO and
   PM. Moreover, the membrane performance was evaluated in terms of
   permeate flux, flux recovery ratio and color removal efficiency for
   synthetic melanoidin solution as well as distillery spent wash effluent.
   A maximum of 54\% color removal was observed for distillery spent wash

Abstract = {{An improved coherent optical receiver architecture that compensates for
   a random drift in the state of polarization (SOP) of both the signal and
   the local oscillator (LO) is presented for the first time. The proposed
   architecture comprises two conventional coherent optical receiver
   front-ends in tandem, where the SOP of the LO is first divided into its
   two orthogonal components and then distributed to each coherent optical
   receiver front-end module. Two distinct methods of polarization
   diversity recovery of the modulation based on the MRC technique and an
   eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition of the covariance matrix have been
   used to effectively recover the transmitted signal. The concept is
   validated by numerical simulations, where a differential quadrature
   phase-shift keyed (DQPSK) modulated signal with a random time-varying
   SOP is first generated. After its mixing with a LO also possessing a
   random time-varying SOP, the algorithms that have been developed are

Abstract = {{Long-span suspension bridges have evolved through the years and with
   them, the bridge girder decks improved as well, changing their shapes
   from standard box-deck girders to twin box and multi-box decks sections.
   The aerodynamic characteristics of the new generation of twin and
   multiple-decks are investigated nowadays, to provide the best design
   wind speeds and the optimum dimensions such bridges could achieve. The
   multi-box Megane bridge deck is one of the new generation bridge decks,
   consisting of two side decks for traffic lanes and two middle decks for
   railways, linked between them with connecting beams. Three-dimensional
   CFD simulations were performed by employing the Large Eddy Simulation
   (LES) algorithm with a standard Smagorinsky subgrid-scale model, for Re
   = 9.3 x 10(7) and angles of attack alpha = -4 degrees, -2 degrees, 0
   degrees, 2 degrees and 4 degrees. Also, a wind tunnel experiment was
   performed for a scaled model, 1:80 of the Megane bridge deck section,
   for Re = 5.1 x 10(5) and the aerodynamic static coefficients were found
   to be in good agreement with the results obtained from the CFD-LES
   model. However the aerodynamic coefficients determined individually,
   from the CFD-LES model, for each of the traffic and railway decks of the
   Megane bridge, varied significantly, especially for the downstream
   traffic deck. Also the pressure distribution and the effect of the
   spacing between the connecting beams, on the wind speed profiles showed
   a slight increase in turbulence above the downstream traffic and railway
   decks.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater wireless sensor networks (UWSNs) have been showed as a
   promising technology to monitor and explore the oceans in lieu of
   traditional undersea wireline instruments. Nevertheless, the data
   gathering of UWSNs is still severely limited because of the acoustic
   channel communication characteristics. One way to improve the data
   collection in UWSNs is through the design of routing protocols
   considering the unique characteristics of the underwater acoustic
   communication and the highly dynamic network topology. In this paper, we
   propose the GEDAR routing protocol for UWSNs. GEDAR is an anycast,
   geographic and opportunistic routing protocol that routes data packets
   from sensor nodes to multiple sonobuoys (sinks) at the sea's surface.
   When the node is in a communication void region, GEDAR switches to the
   recovery mode procedure which is based on topology control through the
   depth adjustment of the void nodes, instead of the traditional
   approaches using control messages to discover and maintain routing paths
   along void regions. Simulation results show that GEDAR significantly
   improves the network performance when compared with the baseline
   solutions, even in hard and difficult mobile scenarios of very sparse
   and very dense networks and for high network traffic loads.}},

Abstract = {{Formation, propagation, and recession of ice cover introduce a dynamic
   boundary layer to the top of rivers during northern winters. Ice cover
   affects water velocity magnitude and distribution, water level and
   consequently conveyance capacity of the river. In this research, total
   resistance, i.e., composite resistance, is studied for a 4 month period
   including stable ice cover, breakup, and open water stages in Lower
   Nelson River (LNR), northern Manitoba, Canada. Flow and ice
   characteristics such as water velocity and depth and ice thickness and
   condition were measured continuously using acoustic techniques. An
   Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) and Shallow Water Ice Profiling
   Sonar (SWIPS) were installed simultaneously on a bottom mount and
   deployed for this purpose. Total resistance to the flow and boundary
   roughness are estimated using measured bulk hydraulic parameters. A
   novel method is developed to calculate composite resistance directly
   from measured under ice velocity profiles. The results of this method
   are compared to the measured total resistance and to the calculated
   composite resistance using formulae available in literature. The new
   technique is demonstrated to compare favorably to measured total
   resistance and to outperform previously available methods.}},

Title = {{Regression models to predict hip joint centers in pathological hip
   population}},
Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{48-54}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The purpose was to investigate the validity of Harrington's and Davis's
   hip joint center (HJC) regression equations on a population affected by
   a hip deformity, (i.e., femoroacetabular impingement). Sixty-seven
   participants (21 healthy controls, 46 with a cam-type deformity)
   underwent pelvic CT imaging. Relevant bony landmarks and geometric HJCs
   were digitized from the images, and skin thickness was measured for the
   anterior and posterior superior iliac spines. Non-parametric statistical
   and Bland-Altman tests analyzed differences between the predicted HJC
   (from regression equations) and the actual HJC (from CT images). The
   error from Davis's model (25.0 +/- 6.7 mm) was larger than Harrington's
   (12.3 +/- 5.9 mm, p < 0.001). There were no differences between groups,
   thus, studies on femoroacetabular impingement can implement conventional
   regression models. Measured skin thickness was 9.7 +/- 7.0 mm and 19.6
   +/- 10.9 mm for the anterior and posterior bony landmarks, respectively,
   and correlated with body mass index. Skin thickness estimates can be
   considered to reduce the systematic error introduced by surface markers.
   New adult-specific regression equations were developed from the CT
   dataset, with the hypothesis that they could provide better estimates
   when tuned to a larger adult-specific dataset. The linear models were
   validated on external datasets and using leave-one-out cross-validation
   techniques; Prediction errors were comparable to those of Harrington's
   model, despite the adult-specific population and the larger sample size,
   thus, prediction accuracy obtained from these parameters could not be
   improved. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The promotional role of oxide supports (CeO2, SnO2, TiO2) on ethanol
   electrooxidation in alkaline media over Pd nanoparticles (NPs) is
   presented and compared to Pd on carbon. XPS revealed a shift to lower
   binding energy of the Pd3d peak when Pd NPs were deposited on metal
   oxides, implying a charge transfer from the oxides to the Pd. The
   catalytic activity of the supported NPs for ethanol electrooxidation was
   assessed by using cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. The
   electrooxidation products were monitored insitu, using polarization
   modulation-infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS), which
   revealed that the supports influence the selectivity of reactions on Pd.
   Pd/CeO2 has superior selectivity towards breaking the C-C bond to
   produce CO2 compared to the other three supports. Acetate, as a product,
   was evident on all of the catalysts, but at different ratios. Pd
   supported on metal oxides showed higher activity and, in particular,
   CeO2 and SnO2 stand out as the best supports.}},

   were determined and used to design fed-batch bioreactor-based processes.
   In fed-batch cultures, fructose supported higher biomass concentrations

Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sensor networks are widely used in various domains like the intelligent
   transportation systems. Users issue queries to sensors and collect
   sensing data. Due to the low quality sensing devices or random link
   failures, sensor data are often noisy. In order to increase the
   reliability of the query results, continuous queries are often employed.
   In this work we focus on continuous holistic queries like Median.
   Existing approaches are mainly designed for non-holistic queries like
   Average. However, it is not trivial to answer holistic ones due to their
   non-decomposable property. We first propose two schemes based on the
   data correlation between different rounds, with one for getting the
   exact answers and the other one for deriving the approximate results. We
   then combine the two proposed schemes into a hybrid approach, which is
   adaptive to the data changing speed. We evaluate this design through
   extensive simulations. The results show that our approach significantly
   reduces the traffic cost compared with previous works while maintaining
   the same accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Adynamic bone is the most frequent type of bone lesion in patients with
   chronic kidney disease; long-term use of antiresorptive therapy may also
   lead to the adynamic bone condition. The hallmark of adynamic bone is a
   loss of bone turnover, and a major clinical concern of adynamic bone is
   diminished bone quality and an increase in fracture risk. Our current
   study aims to investigate how bone quality changes with age in our
   previously established mouse model of adynamic bone. Young and old mice
   (4 months old and 16 months old, respectively) were used in this study.
   Col2.3tk (DTK) mice were treated with ganciclovir and pamidronate to
   create the adynamic bone condition. Bone quality was evaluated using
   established techniques including bone histomorphometry, microcomputed
   tomography, quantitative backscattered electron imaging, and
   biomechanical testing. Changes in mineral and matrix properties were
   examined by powder X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Aging
   controls had a natural decline in bone formation and resorption with a
   corresponding deterioration in trabecular bone structure. Bone turnover
   was severely blunted at all ages in adynamic animals, which preserved
   trabecular bone loss normally associated with aging. However, the
   preservation of trabecular bone mass and structure in old adynamic mice
   did not rescue deterioration of bone mechanical properties. There was
   also a decrease in cortical bone toughness in old adynamic mice that was
   accompanied by a more mature collagen matrix and longer bone crystals.
   Little is known about the effects of metabolic bone disease on bone
   fracture resistance. We observed an age-related decrease in bone
   toughness that was worsened by the adynamic condition, and this decrease
   may be due to material level changes at the tissue level. Our mouse
   model may be useful in the investigation of the mechanisms involved in
   fractures occurring in elderly patients on antiresorptive therapy who
   have very low bone turnover. (c) 2015 American Society for Bone and

   task. Repeatability and between subject similarity were evaluated for
   each method using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). High
   repeatability was found for CNMF (>0.99; 0.99-1.0) compared to NMF (>
   0.26; range 0.26-0.98). Reasonable consistency across subjects was
   improved using the CNMF over the NMF approach. CNMF was found to be a
   more reliable approach than NMF and suitable for between subject

Abstract = {{The measurement of the speech-evoked auditory brainstem response (speech
   ABR) is a promising technique for evaluating auditory function. However,
   the speech ABR is severely contaminated by background noise related to
   other brain electrical activity. The most commonly used method to
   enhance the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the response is coherent
   averaging, while recently adaptive filtering has also been reported. All
   of the applied methods are based on linear operations, but since the
   assumption of linearity may not be valid for neural activity, linear
   methods may not be adequate. In this paper, we present a new nonlinear
   adaptive noise cancellation (ANC) based on a multilayer perceptron
   neural network to enhance the speech ABR and compare its performance
   with a linear ANC algorithm based on least mean squares adaptive
   filtering. The effectiveness of the methods is tested using speech ABR
   data and is based on two different types of SNR measures, the local SNR
   at the fundamental frequency of the response and the overall SNR. The
   results show that the nonlinear neural network-based ANC can reduce the
   required recording time and performs better than the linear ANC
   especially when the SNR of the recorded speech ABR is low.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Two finite-element formulations are developed for the general
   distortional analysis of beams with monosymmetric sections. In the first
   formulation, cubic and linear Hermitian polynomials are adopted to
   interpolate the nodal displacements; whereas in the second formulation,
   shape functions that exactly satisfy the governing field equations were
   used. Because the distortional lateral-torsional and the
   longitudinal-transverse responses are fully uncoupled, separate finite
   elements were developed for both types of behaviors. A comparison with
   other finite-element solutions and a recently developed distortional
   theory established the validity of the present formulations. A study was
   then performed on the stability and convergence characteristics of both
   elements. The new elements were then adopted to solve linearly static
   analysis of simple beams and beams with overhangs. The formulation is
   shown to reliably capture the difference in behavior between stiffened
   and unstiffened beams. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Title = {{Projection of Significant Wave Height in a Coastal Area under RCPs
   Climate Change Scenarios}},
Journal = {{NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This article provides multimodel and multiscenario projections of
   significant wave height for the Qatar coast. Significant wave height is
   used for practical purposes such as offshore and coastal structure
   design as well as transport of marine and lake pollutants. It is mainly
   driven by near-surface wind speed. In this paper, the outputs of the
   different general circulation models (GCMs), under RCP (representative
   concentration pathways) emission scenarios RCP26, RCP45, RCP60, and
   RCP85, were used to project the monthly probability distribution of wind
   speed over the coastal areas. The simulations are part of the Coupled
   Model Intercomparison Project-Phase5 (CMIP5) experiment. Two statistical
   downscaling techniques are used: the Quantile-Quantile transformation
   and nearest neighbor search. Observed wind speed at the Doha Airport
   station was used as a proxy for wind speed over Qatar coast. The
   GCM-simulated wind speeds as well as minimum and maximum temperatures
   were used as predictors while the observed wind speed is used as
   predictand in the nearest neighbor method. In the Quantile-Quantile
   approach, the GCM-simulated wind speed is the sole predictor. These two
   techniques were assessed by comparing the probability distribution of
   the observed and corrected (downscaled) wind-fields. Finally, the
   projected wind speed was used to estimate the expected changes in
   significant wave height under climate change. Results show that: (1)
   both methods can reasonably reproduce the shape of the daily wind-speed
   probability distribution function at the study location but the nearest
   neighbor method is inappropriate for extreme wind speed estimation in
   the future; and (2) the Quantile-Quantile method suggests that
   significant wave height can increase up to 40\% on the Qatar coast. (C)

Abstract = {{Membrane distillation (MD) is a promising separation technique capable
   of being used in the desalination of marine and brackish water.
   Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) flat sheet nano-composite membranes
   were surface modified by coating with electro-spun PVDF nano-fibres to
   increase the surface hydrophobicity. For this purpose, the nan-composite
   membrane containing 7 wt.\% super hydrophobic SiO2 nano-particles, which
   showed the highest flux in our previous work, was first subjected to
   pore size augmentation by increasing the concentration of the pore
   forming agent (Di ionized water). Then, the prepared flat sheet
   membranes were subjected to nanofibres coating by electro-spinning. The
   uncoated and coated composite fabricated membranes were characterized
   using contact angle, liquid entry pressure of water, and scanning
   electron microscopy. The membranes were further tested for 6 h
   desalination by direct contact membrane distillation (DCMD) and vacuum
   membrane distillation (VMD), with a 3.5 wt.\% synthetic NaClaq as the
   feed. In DCMD the feed liquid and permeate side temperature were
   maintained at 27.5 degrees C and 15 degrees C, respectively. For VMD,
   the feed liquid temperature was 27 degrees C and a vacuum of 94.8 kPa
   was applied on the permeate side. The maximum permeate flux achieved was
   3.2 kg/m(2).h for VMD and 6.5 kg/m(2).h for DCMD. The salt rejection
   obtained was higher than 99.98\%. The coated membranes showed a more
   stable flux than the uncoated membranes indicating that the double
   layered membranes have great potential in solving the pore wetting
   problem in MD. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) is a useful method for characterizing
   fuels. In the past it has been applied to the study of refuse derived
   fuel (RDF) and related materials. However, the heterogeneity of RDF
   makes the preparation of small representative samples very difficult and
   this difficulty has limited the effectiveness of TGA for
   characterization of RDF. A TGA method was applied to a variety of
   materials prepared from a commercially available RDF using a variety of
   procedures. Applicability of TGA method to the determination of the
   renewable content of RDF was considered. Cryogenic ball milling was
   found to be an effective means of preparing RDF samples for TGA. When
   combined with an effective sample preparation, TGA could be used as an
   alternative method for assessing the renewable content of RDF. Crown

Abstract = {{A novel Ag2O/Ag3VO4/Ag4V2O7 photocatalyst was synthesized by adjusting
   the molar ratio of silver-vanadium (Ag-V) in a facile hydrothermal
   method to obtain multi-phase Ag2O/Ag3O4/Ag4V2O7 photocatalyst. The
   photocatalytic activity of the prepared samples was quantified by the
   degradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) model organic pollutant under visible
   light irradiation. Compared to pure Ag3VO4, Ag4V2O7 and P25 TiO2,
   respectively, the as-synthesized multi-phase Ag2O/Ag3VO4/Ag4V2O7 powders
   gave rise to a significantly higher photocatalytic activity, achieving
   up to 99\% degradation of RhB in 2 h under visible light. This enhanced
   photocatalytic performance was attributed to the effect of the
   multiphase Ag2O/Ag3VO4/Ag4V2O7 photocatalyst and the surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) of the incorporated metallic silver (Ag-0) nanoparticles
   (NPs) generated during the photocatalysis, as evidenced by post-use
   characterization, resulting in improved visible light absorption and
   electron-hole (e(-)-h(+)) separation. A mechanism was proposed for the
   photocatalytic degradation of RhB on the surface of Ag2O/Ag3VO4/Ag4V2O7.

Abstract = {{The focus of this work is the identification and analysis of the flow
   structures found in pyramidal pin fin arrays produced using the Masked
   Cold Gas Dynamic Spraying (MCGDS) additive manufacturing process. The
   observed flow structures are described, with classic double
   recirculation patterns being identified. The turbulence intensity levels
   of the flow in the axial flow channels was measured and it was found
   that although the flow rates considered in this work correspond to low
   Reynolds numbers (500-3000), significant turbulence intensity levels are
   found. Furthermore, these levels increase as the flow progresses
   downstream, even though the large scale flow structures are well
   established after a few rows (as little as two in this case). A slight
   misalignment of the axial and transverse flow channels resulting from
   imperfections in the masks caused a bypass flow structure to arise in
   the wake of the pin fins, replacing the double recirculation pattern
   observed when there is no such misalignment. A CFD model was used to
   investigate the effect of these misalignments on heat transfer
   efficiency and predicted that there would be no significant effect in
   the configurations studied. Finally, this work shows the importance of
   not only considering the flow structures in the fin's wake, but also the
   effect of these structures on the turbulence levels of the axial flow
   channels, which could significantly affect the thermal and hydrodynamic
   performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Bearing fault diagnosis under variable rotational speed via the joint
   application of windowed fractal dimension transform and generalized
   demodulation: A method free from prefiltering and resampling}},
Journal = {{MECHANICAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68-69}},
Pages = {{15-33}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The conventional way for bearing fault diagnosis under variable
   rotational speed generally includes prefiltering, resampling based on
   shaft rotating frequency and order spectrum analysis. However, its
   application is confined by three major obstacles: a) knowledge-demanding
   parameter determination required by prefiltering, b) unavailable shaft
   rotating frequency for resampling as it is coupled with instantaneous
   fault characteristic frequency (IFCF) by a fault characteristic
   coefficient (FCC) which cannot be decided without knowing what fault
   actually exists, and c) complicated and error-prone resampling process.
   As such, we propose a new method to address these problems. The proposed
   method free from prefiltering and resampling mainly contains the
   following steps: a) extracting envelope by windowed fractal dimension
   (FD) transform, requiring no prefiltering, b) with the envelope signal,
   performing short time Fourier transform (STFT) to get a clear time
   frequency representation (TFR), from which the IFCF and the basic
   demodulator for generalized demodulation (GD) can be obtained, c)
   applying the generalized demodulation to the envelope signal with the
   current demodulator, converting the trajectory of the current
   time-frequency component into a linear path parallel to the time axis,
   d) frequency analyzing the demodulated signal, followed by searching the
   amplitude of the constant frequency where the linear path is situated.
   Updating demodulator via multiplying the basic demodulator by different
   real numbers (i.e., coefficient lambda) and repeating the steps (c)-(d),
   the resampling-free order spectrum is then obtained. Based on the
   resulting spectrum, the final diagnosis decision can be made. The
   proposed method for its implementation on the example of simulated data
   is presented. Finally, experimental data are employed to validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed technique. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Algorithm design for parallel implementation of the SMC-PHD filter}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{119}},
Pages = {{115-127}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) implementation of the probability
   hypothesis density (PHD) filter suffers from low computational
   efficiency since a large number of particles are often required,
   especially when there are a large number of targets and dense clutter.
   In order to speed up the computation, an algorithmic framework for
   parallel SMC-PHD filtering based on multiple processors is proposed. The
   algorithm makes full parallelization of all four steps of the SMC-PHD
   filter and the computational load is approximately equal among parallel
   processors, rendering a high parallelization benefit when there are
   multiple targets and dense clutter. The parallelization is theoretically
   unbiased as it provides the same result as the serial implementation,
   without introducing any approximation. Experiments on multi-core
   computers have demonstrated that our parallel implementation has gained
   considerable speedup compared to the serial implementation of the same
   algorithm. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{All-optical signal processing has been considered a solution to overcome
   the bandwidth and speed limitations imposed by conventional

   reconfigured to perform signal processing functions including ordinary
   differential equation solving and temporal intensity differentiation.
   The reconfigurability is achieved by controlling the injection currents.

Title = {{Hip Joint Stresses Due to Cam-Type Femoroacetabular Impingement: A
   Systematic Review of Finite Element Simulations}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{Background
   The cam deformity causes the anterosuperior femoral head to obstruct
   with the acetabulum, resulting in femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) and
   elevated risks of early osteoarthritis. Several finite element models
   have simulated adverse loading conditions due to cam FAI, to better
   understand the relationship between mechanical stresses and cartilage
   degeneration. Our purpose was to conduct a systematic review and examine
   the previous finite element models and simulations that examined hip
   joint stresses due to cam FAI.
   Methods
   The systematic review was conducted to identify those finite element
   studies of cam-type FAI. The review conformed to the Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and studies
   that reported hip joint contact pressures or stresses were included in
   the quantitative synthesis.
   Results
   Nine articles studied FAI morphologies using finite element methods and
   were included in the qualitative synthesis. Four articles specifically
   examined contact pressures and stresses due to cam FAI and were included
   in the quantitative synthesis. The studies demonstrated that cam FAI
   resulted in substantially elevated contact pressures (median = 10.4 MPa,
   range = 8.5-12.2 MPa) and von Mises stresses (median 15.5 MPa, range =
   15.0-16.0 MPa) at the acetabular cartilage; and elevated maximum-shear
   stress on the bone (median = 15.2 MPa, range = 14.3-16.0 MPa), in
   comparison with control hips, during large amplitudes of hip motions.
   Many studies implemented or adapted idealized, ball-and-cup, parametric
   models to predict stresses, along with homogeneous bone material
   properties and in vivo instrumented prostheses loading data.
   Conclusion
   The formulation of a robust subject-specific FE model, to delineate the
   pathomechanisms of FAI, remains an ongoing challenge. The available

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are getting popular for their deployment
   in unattended environments, where a registered user can log in to the
   network and access data collected from the desired sensor. Because of
   limited resources and computation power in sensor nodes, an
   authentication protocol should be simple and efficient. M.L. Das
   proposed a two-factor authentication scheme for WSNs. Because his scheme
   uses only one-way hash function and XOR operation, it is well suited for
   resource-constrained environments. Because of some flaws in Das's
   scheme, several improved schemes have been introduced. In this paper, we
   show that Das's scheme and its derivatives not only have security
   imperfections but also do not provide key agreement. To overcome their
   security shortcomings, we propose a novel user authentication scheme
   with key agreement for WSN. We furnish security analysis of the proposed
   protocol to show its robustness to various attacks as well as analyze
   its performance to determine its efficiency. We provide protocol
   analysis and verification of the proposed protocol. Compared with the
   existing schemes, it is more robust and offers better security.

Abstract = {{The combined effect of strontium and bismuth on the flake-to-fibrous
   transition associated with eutectic silicon in near-eutectic
   Al-11.7Si-1.8Cu-0.8Zn-0.6Fe-0.3Mg alloys, in both normal and interrupted
   solidification, on the macro, micro and nano-scale has been
   investigated. The results revealed that an interaction occurred between
   Sr and Bi at a certain threshold weight ratio of Sr/Bi, whereby the fine
   fibrous Si changed into coarse flake-like morphology. This interaction
   led to a dramatic change of both the nucleation and growth modes of
   eutectic Si. Interrupted quenching and electron back-scatter diffraction
   observations showed that fibrous Si nucleates independently between
   aluminium dendrites whereas flake Si nucleates epitaxially adjacent to
   the dendrites. TEM observations showed a decrease of twin density and
   increase of twin spacing associated with the fibrous-to-flake
   transition. Moreover, eutectic coherency point revealed a shorter time
   for the growth of eutectic grain in fibrous silicon. Formation of the
   pre-eutectic ternary compound of Bi2Mg2Sr is proposed to be responsible
   for the deactivation of Sr and consequently fibrous-to-flake transition
   of silicon. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Evaluation of a smartphone human activity recognition application with
   able-bodied and stroke participants}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Background: Mobile health monitoring using wearable sensors is a growing
   area of interest. As the world's population ages and locomotor
   capabilities decrease, the ability to report on a person's mobility
   activities outside a hospital setting becomes a valuable tool for
   clinical decision-making and evaluating healthcare interventions.
   Smartphones are omnipresent in society and offer convenient and suitable
   sensors for mobility monitoring applications. To enhance our
   understanding of human activity recognition (HAR) system performance for
   able-bodied and populations with gait deviations, this research
   evaluated a custom smartphone-based HAR classifier on fifteen
   able-bodied participants and fifteen participants who suffered a stroke.
   Methods: Participants performed a consecutive series of mobility tasks
   and daily living activities while wearing a BlackBerry Z10 smartphone on
   their waist to collect accelerometer and gyroscope data. Five features
   were derived from the sensor data and used to classify participant
   activities (decision tree). Sensitivity, specificity and F-scores were
   calculated to evaluate HAR classifier performance.
   Results: The classifier performed well for both populations when
   differentiating mobile from immobile states (F-score > 94 \%). As
   activity recognition complexity increased, HAR system sensitivity and
   specificity decreased for the stroke population, particularly when using
   information derived from participant posture to make classification
   decisions.
   Conclusions: Human activity recognition using a smartphone based system
   can be accomplished for both able-bodied and stroke populations;
   however, an increase in activity classification complexity leads to a
   decrease in HAR performance with a stroke population. The study results
   can be used to guide smartphone HAR system development for populations
   with differing movement characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{Films based on methylcellulose (MC) and pectin (PEC) of different ratios
   were prepared. MC/PEC (90:10) (MP10) gave the best results in terms of
   mechanical properties. Sodium montmorillonite (MMT) (1,3 and 5 wt\%) was
   incorporated in the MP10 matrix. The resulting films were characterized
   by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy, and it was
   found that nanocomposites were intercalated in nature. Mechanical
   studies established that addition of 3 wt\% MMT gave best results in
   terms of mechanical properties. However, thermo-gravimetric and dynamic
   mechanical analysis proved that decomposition and glass transition
   temperature increased with increasing MMT concentration from 1 to 5
   wt\%. It was also observed that moisture absorption and water vapor
   permeability studies gave best result in the case of 3 wt\% MMT. Optical
   clarity of the nanocomposite films was not much affected with loading of
   MMT. In vitro drug release studies showed that MC/PEC/MMT based films
   can be used for controlled transdermal drug delivery applications. (C)

   ribbon resonator, by tuning the graphene Fermi level (via an applied
   gate voltage) and by altering the intensity of the incident THz wave. We
   determine the intensity-dependent increase in the refractive index of a
   Kerr nonlinear medium bounding graphene, via self-phase modulation and
   via the more efficient process of cross-phase modulation, revealing a
   noticeable red-shift in the resonant frequencies of the ribbon
   resonator. These concepts lead to ultrafast switching of SPP
   transmission through the ribbon (from a high to a low state). Using Kerr
   nonlinear media to bound graphene increases the tunability of
   graphene-based devices, enabling nonlinear plasmonic and ultrafast
   processing in the THz regime. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Consider a team of asynchronous agents that must explore an unknown
   graph G in presence of a black hole, a node which destroys all incoming
   agents without leaving any observable trace. Inter-agent communication
   and coordination is achieved using tokens that agents can pick up,
   carry, and drop on the nodes. It is known that, if the agents have a map
   of G, the problem can be solved with a constant number of tokens. The
   question we study is under what conditions it is possible to explore
   with 0 (1) tokens if the agents have no map of G. The contribution of
   this paper is to provide a definite answer to this question. We first
   prove the unexpected negative result that if only a constant number of
   tokens are available, then Delta + 1 agents are not sufficient, where
   Delta is the maximum node degree. We also prove that, regardless of the
   team size, two tokens are not sufficient. In other words, any solution
   protocol using a constant number of tokens, must use at least Delta + 2
   agents and at least three tokens.
   We then show that these bounds are tight by presenting a protocol that
   allows the exploration of an unknown anonymous dangerous graph using
   only three tokens and Delta + 2 agents. At the core of our solution is a
   novel token-based asynchronous communication protocol, which is of
   independent interest.
   Our algorithm assumes that the number of agents is known; in case the
   number of agents is sufficient but unknown, we show that the problem has
   a simple solution that uses only five tokens. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Hydrophobic membrane is desired to avoid pore wetting phenomenon in
   membrane distillation (MD). In the present paper, highly hydrophobic
   Hyflon AD60/PVDF composite hollow fiber membranes were prepared by
   coating a copolymer (Hyflon AD60) of tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) and
   2,2,4-trifluoro-5-trifluoro methoxy-1,3-dioxole (TTD) on poly(vinylidene
   fluoride) (PVDF) membranes. The effects of Hyflon AD60 concentration,
   coating time, heat-treatment temperature and heat-treatment time on the
   structures and performances of Hyflon AD60/PVDF composite hollow fiber
   membranes in vacuum membrane distillation (VMD) process were
   investigated. The results show that the hydrophobicity of PVDF hollow
   fiber membrane was significantly improved by coating Hyflon AD60. The
   optimized Hyflon AD60 concentration, coating time, heat-treatment
   temperature and heat-treatment time were 0.1 wt\%, 10-20 min, 40-50
   degrees C and 9 h, respectively. Employing NaCl solution with
   concentration of 35 g x L-1, under a vacuum of 0.09 MPa and feed
   temperature of 70 degrees C, the water flux and salt rejection of the
   composite hollow fiber membrane in VMD process reached to approximately
   10 kg x m(-2) x h(-1) and higher than 99.9 \%, respectively, and kept
   stable, indicating that Hyflon AD60/PVDF composite membrane is an
   excellent candidate for operation in VMD operation. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Effects of hydrophilic silica nanoparticles and Non-Woven Fabric (NWF)
   backing material on the properties and performance of the Polyvinylidene
   Fluoride (PVDF) membrane have been studied in this work. The
   nanocomposite membranes were prepared by the phase inversion method and
   characterized in terms of surface pore size, cross-sectional morphology,
   thickness, porosity, surface roughness and hydrophobicity. The
   fabricated membranes were subjected to Vacuum Membrane Distillation
   (VMD) experiments and their performance was evaluated through measuring
   the pure water flux and salt rejection. According to the results,
   effects of the hydrophilic nano-additives and NWF polyester enabled much
   higher VMD flux than the neat PVDF membrane when an appropriate amount
   of the nano-filler was added, possibly due to increase in the surface
   pore size and the reduction of the sponge-like layer thickness. The
   supported nanocomposite membranes possessed appropriate Liquid Entry
   Pressure (LEPw) and mechanical strength, which make the membrane
   applicable in VMD process. When 7.0 wt.\% of the silica nanoparticles
   was incorporated in a NWF supported membrane, the pure water flux became
   12749.6 g/m(2) h at feed temperature of 27.5 degrees C and permeate side
   pressure of 1.2 kPa, representing a 2456\% increase from the neat PVDF

   temperature and electrical conductivity are monitored for a period of
   150 days of curing. The testing and monitoring programmes are conducted
   in undrained conditions, with and without pressure application. The
   obtained results show that the curing stress affects the
   hydro-mechanical behaviour of CPB for up to 28 days. Within this curing
   period, the CPB exhibits enhanced hydro-mechanical performance. However,
   application of sustained excessive curing stress onto the CPB samples
   induces the propagation of microcracks in the backfill structure, thus
   causing lower mechanical strength and higher fluid permeability at the
   more advanced ages. Furthermore, the mineralogical and chemical
   compositions of the tailings (e.g., sulfidic tailings) can significantly
   alter the mechanical strength properties (uniaxial compressive strength
   and elastic modulus) and the permeability of the CPB. The evolution of
   coupled factors and characteristics of the CPB at an early age control
   and influence its long-term behaviour and performance.}},

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional numerical model of inclined turbulent jets with
   negatively buoyant discharge into stationary ambient water is presented
   in this paper to study certain jet parameters with turbulence schemes
   that have not been employed before in this context such as standard
   Boussinesq gradient diffusion hypothesis and general gradient diffusion
   hypothesis to account for the buoyancy-induced turbulence generation.
   Two jet discharge angles have been chosen for this study: 30 degrees and
   45 degrees with the horizontal. These two angles are chosen in this
   study due to lower terminal rise heights for 30 degrees and 45 degrees,
   a fact which is critically important for discharges of effluent into
   shallow waters compared to higher angles than these values. The
   spatio-temporal jet evolutions for these cases have been modeled using
   OpenFOAM open-source CFD code, which is based on Finite-Volume Method.
   Results presented in this paper deal with the geometrical and flow
   properties of the inclined dense jets. The densimetric Froude number of
   the effluent at the nozzle ranges between 10 and 34. Two
   Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes turbulence models are applied to
   evaluate the accuracy of the numerical predictions: the realizable

Abstract = {{In contrast to many image watermarking schemes, the suggested method is
   implemented in the JPEG compressed domain with no transcoding or
   decompression. Therefore, this scheme is highly efficient in real-time
   applications and suitable for multimedia information, which is rarely
   available in an uncompressed form. The proposed watermarking scheme is
   very flexible, and can be tailored to meet the requirements of different
   real applications. In order to attain a real-time watermarking
   capability, the proposed system avoids many of the computation steps
   associated with JPEG compression. Specifically, the forward and inverse
   DCT do not require to be calculated, nor do any of the computations
   associated with quantization. Robustness against JPEG compression and
   additive noise attacks is achieved with the proposed system. A further
   advantage of the suggested technique is that it allows a watermark to be
   detected in an image without referencing to the original image, or to
   any other information used in the watermark embedding process. At the
   decoder, only entropy decoding is enough to detect watermark and other
   steps of image decoding are not necessary for detection. The
   experimental results show how different capacity can be achieved in the
   range of 1 to 4096 bits for a grayscale 512x512x8 bit image. The
   watermarking algorithm reduces the quality about 0.65 dB, which is
   excellent for a watermarking system in compressed domain.}},

Abstract = {{In heterogeneous networks (HetNets) users are usually distributed
   non-uniformly. Analysis of the impact of non-uniformity of user
   distribution on HetNets is essential for designing efficient networks.
   This paper proposes a non-uniform user distribution model in which the
   user density depends on the distance to the associated base stations
   (BSs). Moreover, different tiers, such as macro cells, pico cells or
   femto cells, may have different user densities with different level of
   attraction to their associated BSs. Our proposed non-uniform user
   distribution model covers many possible combinations. We give an
   accurate performance analysis of the downlink coverage probability. The
   numerical evaluations show that our analysis can produce results that
   closely match the simulation results.}},

   that the problem is (non-uniformly) fixed-parameter tractable for
   tree-depth. We also provide several natural classes of bipartite planar

   dual graphs of arrangements of monotone curves, that always have 3-track

Abstract = {{It is known that every proper minor-closed class of graphs has bounded
   stack-number (a.k.a. book thickness and page number). While this
   includes notable graph families such as planar graphs and graphs of
   bounded genus, many other graph families are not closed under taking
   minors. For fixed g and k, we show that every n-vertex graph that can be
   embedded on a surface of genus g with at most k crossings per edge has
   stack-number O(log n); this includes k-planar graphs. The previously
   best known bound for the stack-number of these families was O(root n),
   except in the case of 1-planar graphs. Analogous results are proved for
   map graphs that can be embedded on a surface of fixed genus. None of
   these families is closed under taking minors. The main ingredient in the
   proof of these results is a construction proving that n-vertex graphs
   that admit constant layered separators have O(log n) stack-number.}},

Abstract = {{A geometric graph is angle-monotone if every pair of vertices has a path
   between them that-after some rotation-is x-and y-monotone.
   Angle-monotone graphs are root 2-spanners and they are increasing-chord
   graphs. Dehkordi, Frati, and Gudmundsson introduced angle-monotone
   graphs in 2014 and proved that Gabriel triangulations are angle-monotone
   graphs. We give a polynomial time algorithm to recognize angle-monotone
   geometric graphs. We prove that every point set has a plane geometric
   graph that is generalized angle-monotone-specifically, we prove that the
   half-theta(6)-graph is generalized angle-monotone. We give a local
   routing algorithm for Gabriel triangulations that finds a path from any
   vertex s to any vertex t whose length is within 1+root 2 times the
   Euclidean distance from s to t. Finally, we prove some lower bounds and
   limits on local routing algorithms on Gabriel triangulations.}},

Abstract = {{Netflix, Hulu, etc are some of the most popular video content streaming
   services that are increasingly being accessed through many popular
   consumer devices such as Apple TV, XBox, Wii, etc. It has now become
   possible to conveniently interact with the video contents by using the
   input hardwares that these devices provide. We emulate the setups that
   many of these popular platforms provide in order to develop learning
   based video interaction games. The games leverage the user interaction
   feature with the video contents. In the award winning learning
   television series such as Mickey Mouse ClubHouse, WordWorld, Super Why
   etc., the protagonists present learning based questions by using various
   scenarios and viewers learn the answers passively as they wait. In order
   to foster active participation of the viewers, we author the movie with
   learning questions at particular timelines of the video and provide
   interaction options. In those specified timelines, the learners interact
   with the presented questions by using Wii's pointMe or XBox Kinect's
   gesture based interactions and input answers. The interactions assist
   the learners to engage with the video contents and make it possible to
   actively participate in the learning process. In order to examine the
   suitability of the proposed approach, we perform usability experiments
   in a technology-augmented learning space and report our findings.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, metal support interaction (MSI) has been demonstrated to be
   closely related to electrochemical promotion of catalysis (EPOC) in the
   functionality of the process through spillover/backspillover of ionic
   species to/from the conductive support. In the present work, the
   interaction that iridium oxide (IrOx) nanoparticles have with two mixed
   ionic-electronic conducting (MIEC) materials (i.e., ceria, CeO2 and
   titania, TiO2) for ethylene oxidation is evaluated. To this end, the
   open circuit catalytic oxidation of ethylene as well as steady-state
   polarization measurements were carried out for free-standing
   (unsupported) IrOx and ceria- and titania-supported IrOx (similar to 1
   nm). The presence of these two supports was found to increase the
   catalytic reaction rate when compared to the free-standing IrOx and
   decrease the electrochemical reaction rate at the three-phase boundary,
   as confirmed by the exchange current density (i(o)). In the light-off
   experiments, the IrOx/CeO2 catalyst showed a higher reaction rate until
   300 degrees C; however IrOx/TiO2 was superior at 350 degrees C. It was
   also shown that the catalysts with lower i(o) resulted in higher
   open-circuit reaction rates due to the larger amount of
   thermally-induced backspillover promoters to the gas exposed catalyst
   surface, in agreement with the EPOC phenomenon.}},

Abstract = {{As an important component of Smart Cities, transportation system plays a
   critical role to address the sustainability and mobility of the society.
   One key concern is that the number of vehicles continuously increases
   faster than the available infrastructure, as well as the traffic
   congestion is a difficult issue to deal with. Several solutions to
   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been proposed to identify
   congestion and re-route the vehicles afterwards. In this direction, this
   work introduces SPARTAN, a fully distributed ITS solution, which
   notifies drivers about congested areas through Vehicle-to-Vehicle
   communication and employs a real-time decision making mechanism used to
   reroute vehicles to avoid the congested areas. Simulation results show
   the effectiveness of SPARTAN in calculating new routes and disseminating
   them to vehicles that approaching a congestion area. As a consequence,
   SPARTAN reduces the travel time and the congestion time in urban
   scenarios when compared to existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Using drone base stations (drone-BSs) in wireless networks has started
   attracting attention. Drone-BSs can assist the ground BSs in both
   capacity and coverage enhancement. One of the important problems about
   integrating drone-BSs to cellular networks is the management of their
   placement to satisfy the dynamic system requirements. In this paper, we
   propose a method to find the positions of drone-BSs in an area with
   different user densities using a heuristic algorithm. The goal is to
   find the minimum number of drone-BSs and their 3D placement so that all
   the users are served. Our simulation results show that the proposed
   approach can satisfy the quality-of-service requirements of the network.}},

   probability over Nakagami-m fading channels. At the relay node of the
   proposed system, physical-layer-network-coding technique and
   variable-gain full-duplex amplify-and-forward relaying method are
   combined for two-way transmission. End-to-end
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (SINR) expression is derived for
   different power transmissions at the source and relay nodes. New exact
   outage probability expression is obtained in a single-integral form by
   using cumulative distribution function of the end-to-end SINR. The
   analytical results are verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. We also
   provide lower-bound and asymptotic expressions in closed-form for the
   outage performance. It is shown that the outage performance of the
   system is enhanced as long as either the transmit power or the
   efficiency of LI cancellation process increases. We also observe that
   the outage probability converges to an error floor due to the residual

Abstract = {{Information delivery using chemical molecules is an integral part of
   biology at multiple distance scales and has attracted recent interest in
   bioengineering and communication. The collective signal strength at the
   receiver (i.e., the expected number of observed molecules inside the
   receiver), resulting from a large number of transmitters at random
   distances (e.g., due to mobility), can have a major impact on the
   reliability and efficiency of the molecular communication system.
   Modeling the collective signal from multiple diffusion sources can be
   computationally and analytically challenging. In this paper, we present
   the first tractable analytical model for the collective signal strength
   due to randomly-placed transmitters, whose positions are modelled as a
   homogeneous Poisson point process in three-dimensional (3D) space. By
   applying stochastic geometry, we derive analytical expressions for the
   expected number of observed molecules at a fully absorbing receiver and
   a passive receiver. Our results reveal that the collective signal
   strength at both types of receivers increases proportionally with
   increasing transmitter density. The proposed framework dramatically
   simplifies the analysis of large-scale molecular systems in both
   communication and biological applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a cooperative diffusion-based molecular communication
   system is considered where distributed receivers collaboratively
   determine a transmitter's signal. In this system, the receivers first
   make local hard decisions about the current transmitted bit and then
   report these decisions to a fusion center (FC). The FC combines the
   local hard decisions to make a global decision using an N-out-of-K
   fusion rule. Asymmetric and symmetric topologies are considered and for
   each topology, two reporting scenarios, namely, perfect reporting and
   noisy reporting, are addressed. Closed-form analytical expressions for
   the expected global error probability are derived for all considered
   topologies and scenarios. Numerical and simulation results show that
   system reliability can be greatly improved by combining the detection
   information of distributed receivers.}},

Abstract = {{The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm makes the Internet more pervasive,
   interconnecting objects of everyday life, and is a promising solution
   for the development of next-generation services. Smart cities exploit
   the most advanced information technologies to improve and add value to
   existing public services. Applying the IoT paradigm to smart cities is
   fundamental to build sustainable Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT) platforms. Having citizens involved in the process
   through mobile crowdsensing (MCS) techniques unleashes potential
   benefits as MCS augments the capabilities of the platform without
   additional costs. Recruitment of participants is a key challenge when
   MCS systems assign sensing tasks to the users. Proper recruitment both
   minimizes the cost and maximizes the return, such as the number and the
   accuracy of accomplished tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel user
   recruitment policy for data acquisition in mobile crowdsensing systems.
   The policy can be employed in two modes, namely sociability-driven mode
   and distance-based mode. Sociability stands for the willingness of users
   in contributing to sensing tasks. Performance evaluation, conducted in a
   real urban environment for a large number of participants, reveals the
   effectiveness of sociability-driven user recruitment as the average
   number of recruited users improves by at least a factor of two.}},

Abstract = {{A Vehicular Cloud generally focuses on several aspects, which include
   providing a set of computational services at low cost to vehicle
   drivers; minimizing traffic congestion, accidents, travel time, and
   environmental pollution; and ensuring the use of low energy and
   real-time services of software, platforms, and infrastructure with QoS
   to drivers. The largest challenge in vehicular mobile Clouds consists of
   creating a mechanism for management and search resources that does not
   depend on roadside infrastructure, which consequently requires the
   spontaneous and dynamic creation of a Cloud through the resources shared
   by vehicles. Therefore, the system must enable collaboration and
   cooperation between vehicles so that they may establish connections to
   provide resources. To address this challenge, we propose a peer-to-peer
   protocol to assist in the discovery and management of resources in a
   vehicular mobile Cloud without depending on the support of a roadside
   infrastructure so that vehicles are expected to organize themselves and
   establish collaborations to manage and share their resources. Simulation
   results show that the proposed approach introduces a short search time
   of approximately 0.5 (ms) to seek resources in one hop and approximately
   0.9 (ms) to seek more of a hop in resources. Furthermore, the proposed
   protocol enables a high availability of resources, about 87\%.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical comparison of active and passive
   receiver models in diffusive molecular communication. In the active
   model, molecules are absorbed when they collide with the receiver
   surface. In the passive model, the receiver is a virtual boundary that
   does not affect molecule behavior. Two approaches are presented to
   derive transforms between the receiver signals. As an example, two
   models for an unbounded diffusion-only molecular communication system
   with a spherical receiver are unified. As time increases in the
   three-dimensional system, the transform functions have constant scaling
   factors, such that the receiver models are effectively equivalent.
   Methods are presented to enable the transformation of stochastic
   simulations, which are used to verify the transforms and demonstrate
   that transforming the simulation of a passive receiver can be more
   efficient and more accurate than the direct simulation of an absorbing
   receiver.}},

Abstract = {{Delay-tolerant sensor networks (DTSNs) require efficient MAC
   transmission strategies that include energy constraint, relaxed latency,
   mobility support and diverse traffic load. Reservation-based and
   contention-based MAC schemes are used to improve throughput and energy
   consumption. In this paper, we propose a traffic adaptive,
   energy-efficient MAC protocol to achieve better data transmissions and
   as energy consumption, in order to satisfy the requirements in DTSN. In
   our protocol, reservation and contention modes are adjustable, in order
   to adapt to the traffic load with a suitable duty cycle length for
   achieving energy efficiency. The simulation results of our protocol
   demonstrate better performance in terms of energy efficiency and traffic
   adaptability than the schedule-based MAC protocol TDMA, the
   contention-based protocol CSMA, and the traffic adaptive protocol TRAMA
   under mobile DTSN environments.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous cellular networks (HetNets), even in 5G systems, are
   plagued by the problem of intra-cell interference, i.e., a strong
   interfering transmission from a macro BS (MBS) interferes at all the
   users associated to the several small cells of the HetNet. This
   phenomenon may significantly reduce the spectral efficiency. With the
   dominating presence of bandwidth-hungry video in cellular systems,
   making the most out of the available spectrum resources is critical for
   the mobile operators. In this paper, we present a cooperative protocol
   that can ensure spectral efficient delivery of high quality video in
   HetNets. The key characteristic is that the transmitted information from
   a small cell base station is decoded at several users in the small cell
   when the MBS also transmits. The users that decode act subsequently as
   relays to the final user. Our novel protocol is supported by a new
   optimization framework for resource allocation in the HetNet and rate
   allocation at the video source. Performance results indicate that the
   presence of users, a previously unexploited dimension in HetNets, offers
   significant SE gains.}},

Abstract = {{Widespread use of connected smart devices that are equipped with various
   built-in sensors has introduced the mobile crowdsensing concept to the
   IoT-driven information and communication applications. Mobile
   crowdsensing requires implicit collaboration between the
   crowdsourcer/recruiter platforms and users. Additionally, users need to
   be incentivized by the crowdsensing platform because each party aims to
   maximize their utility. Due to the participatory nature of data
   collection, trustworthiness and truthfulness pose a grand challenge in
   crowdsensing systems in the presence of malicious users, who either aim
   to manipulate sensed data or collaborate unfaithfully with the
   motivation of maximizing their income. In this paper, we propose a
   game-theoretic approach for trustworthiness-driven user recruitment in
   mobile crowdsensing systems that consists of three phases: i) user
   recruitment, ii) collaborative decision making on trust scores, and iii)
   badge rewarding. Our proposed framework incentivizes the users through a
   sub-game perfect equilibrium (SPE) and gamification techniques. Through
   simulations, we show that the platform and user utilities, defined in
   terms of costs and revenues, can be improved respectively by up to the
   order of 50\% and of at least 15\% when compared to fully-distributed
   and user-centric trustworthy crowdsensing.}},

Abstract = {{Low transmit power base stations (BSs) with flexible cell extension are
   included in wireless networks in order to support hot spots and cell
   edge coverage. Densification of different kind of BSs is one of the most

   Evaluation of the system performance in heterogeneous cellular networks
   is a crucial topic. In the literature, many papers study the performance
   analysis over Rayleigh fading to provide theoretical expressions such as
   the coverage probability, mean throughput and average rate. However,
   performance analysis for general fading is very limited. In this paper,
   the coverage probability over general fading is discussed and the
   derivation of downlink coverage probability over Nakagami-m fading is
   explained. To validate our analysis, we perform Monte Carlo simulations
   and the results closely match. The impacts of the key parameters, such
   as transmit power, BS density, cell extension bias, path loss component,
   distance to the BS are demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of computing and mobile devices makes the problem of user
   identification and verification an essential requirement for many
   applications. Haptics devices include the sense of touch in the form of
   kinesthetic and tactile feedback which provide additional features
   within handwritten signatures. However, they generate high dimensional
   data and dimensionality reduction techniques become useful for data
   mining, machine learning and visualization.
   Nonlinear transformations have been used for this, but in present day
   scenarios (Big Data, the Internet of Things, massive data streams, etc.)
   the computation becomes more complex, time consuming or impractical.
   Moreover, the relationships between the features of the original and the
   target spaces are more difficult to uncover. Extreme Learning Machines
   (ELM) are used for approximating nonlinear manifold learning methods in
   two ways: as a functional representation for implicit methods, and as
   simpler surrogate models for explicit mapping techniques. In the context
   of Haptic handwritten signatures, five implicit and explicit nonlinear
   transformation methods are investigated. In all cases it was found that
   ELM approximations to the mappings obtained with the original methods
   exhibit very good behavior and can be used either as functional
   representations for the implicit methods or as simpler surrogate models
   for explicit techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Endowing Decision Support Systems (DSSs) with a risk-aware view of the
   environment they operate in is critical to maintaining an acceptable
   level of Situational Awareness (SAW) as well as helping decision makers
   arrive at more accurate and timely conclusions. In particular,
   determining the situational elements that are presently impacting the
   system behaviour and to what extent-leads to a refined SAW picture and
   ensures valuable knowledge propagation to the upstream layers of the
   underlying fusion/decision making process.
   In this paper, we augment an existing Risk Management Framework (RMF)
   with a set of atomic risk models capturing different situational
   elements. Contextual information feeding the DSS is employed to either
   activate one or more of these models or tailor their internal risk
   assessment. We show how context-aware dynamic risk management can be
   achieved in a DSS governed by the proposed architecture. Two maritime
   scenarios (vessel encountering active weather and vessel navigating in a
   piracy-infested region) serve to illustrate the advantages of the
   proposed context-aware methodology in terms of improved situational
   understanding, system interpretability, support to other fusion
   processes (e.g., threat assessment) and computational tractability. To
   the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that contextual
   information is used to drive the risk assessment module of a DSS. The
   methodology is not exclusive to the maritime arena and can be easily
   extrapolated to other domains.}},

   sites. These visits can be driven by email, web search results or links
   from other web pages. In all cases, however, the user is required to
   take some action, such as clicking on a desired Uniform Resource Locator
   (URL). In order to identify these malicious sites, the web security
   community has developed blacklisting services. These blacklists are in
   turn constructed by an array of techniques including manual reporting,
   honeypots, and web crawlers combined with site analysis heuristics.
   Inevitably, many malicious sites are not blacklisted either because they
   are too recent or were never or incorrectly evaluated.
   In this paper, we address the detection of malicious URLs as a binary
   classification problem and study the performance of several well-known
   classifiers, namely Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Multi-Layer
   Perceptron, Decision Trees, Random Forest and k-Nearest Neighbors.
   Furthermore, we adopted a public dataset comprising 2.4 million URLs
   (instances) and 3.2 million features. The numerical simulations have
   shown that most classification methods achieve acceptable prediction
   rates without requiring either advanced feature selection techniques or
   the involvement of a domain expert. In particular, Random Forest and
   Multi-Layer Perceptron attain the highest accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in unsupervised learning have allowed the efficient learning of
   feature representations directly from large sets of unlabeled data
   instead of using traditional handcrafted features. However, improving
   algorithms to increase the quality of these representations in the
   absence of labeled data is still an area of active research. This paper
   evaluates visual features learned through unsupervised learning,
   specifically comparing regularization and preprocessing methods using
   Gaussian filters on a single-layer network. Using the restricted
   Boltzmann machine as the unsupervised learning mechanism, features
   emerging through training on natural videos, with different biasing and
   preprocessing based on Gaussian filters, are compared by metrics to
   measure invariance as well as classification performance on standard
   datasets. When Gaussian filters are convolved with adjacent hidden layer
   activations from a single example during training, topographies begin to
   emerge where adjacent features become tuned to slightly varying stimuli.
   1D, 2D, and 3D topographies are compared. When a Gaussian low-pass
   filter is applied to activations from a single hidden node across frames
   drawn from video, features that are more invariant to transformations
   are produced. Finally, when Gaussian filters are applied to the visible
   nodes, images become blurrier; learning from these images also leads to
   invariant features. The networks are trained using the Hollywood2 video
   dataset, and tested on image classification of the static CIFAR-10 and
   STL-10 datasets. To prove that the improvements are independent of the
   dataset, the networks are shown to produce similar results when trained
   on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The induction of topography or simple image
   blurring via Gaussian filters during training produce better
   discriminative features as evidenced by the consistent and notable
   increase in classification results that they produce. Also, in the
   visual domain, invariant features are desirable such that objects can be
   classified accurately despite transformations. It is found that most of
   the compared methods produce more invariant features, however,
   classification accuracy does not correlate to invariance.}},

Abstract = {{GaAs phototransducers with 5 to 12 p/n junctions are shown to
   demonstrate breakthrough performance in optical conversion efficiency
   ranging from 65\% to just under 70\%. In particular, for a
   current-matched 12 junction device we have recorded an efficiency of
   66.5\% at V-oc = 14.46V (open circuit voltage) with an approximately 650
   suns / 841 nm monochromatic source. Our simulations reproduce the PV
   characteristics of the physical devices with good (similar to \%)
   accuracy for V-oc and I-sc (short circuit current), which allows us to
   numerically study the influence of experimental conditions and design
   factors on device performance. Moreover, our simulations suggest that
   measured efficiencies are very close to the theoretical limits of the
   heterostructures under consideration. Our focus in these proceedings is
   twofold: a) to present an overview of the results of these experiments
   as well as b) study the factors which limit simulated device performance

Title = {{Location-Aware Authorization Scheme for Emergency Response}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{4590-4608}},
Abstract = {{Effective emergency (such as a hurricane, a building on fire, and so on)
   response requires accurate, relevant, timely, and location-aware
   information (e.g., environmental information, health records, and so
   on). Acquiring information in such critical situations encounters
   substantial challenges, such as large volume of data processing,
   unstructured data, privacy, authorized data access, and so forth. Among
   the issues, access authorization has received little attention. Existing
   solutions for data authorization either do not scale well or merely
   consider a Break-the-Glass concept in which a master key is provided to
   the first responders (FRs) to decrypt the corresponding ciphertext. This
   may not only enable unauthorized users to access information, but it may
   also overwhelm FRs by the large volume of accessible data. To jointly
   address the aforementioned issues, this paper proposes a location-aware
   authorization scheme that enables FRs to access information provided
   that they are within a predefined distance from data owners at the time
   of an emergency. We innovatively integrate attribute-based encryption
   with broadcast encryption to incorporate dynamic attributes (i.e.,
   location and time) into an access policy. Such attributes act as filters
   to eliminate data irrelevant to an ongoing emergency. As a result, our
   scheme provides authorized access to accurate, relevant, timely, and
   location-aware information. We provide extensive security analysis and
   performance evaluations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme.
   The analysis shows that the scheme imposes constant communication and
   decryption computation overheads. Furthermore, the proposed scheme is
   proven chosen plain-text attack selectively secure based on m-bilinear
   Diffie-Hellman exponent assumption. It also addresses the key escrow
   problem.}},

Abstract = {{Knee-ankle-foot orthoses (KAFOs) are full leg braces for individuals
   with knee extensor weakness, designed to support the person during
   weight bearing activities by preventing knee flexion. KAFOs typically
   result in an unnatural gait pattern and are primarily used for level
   ground walking. A novel variable resistance orthotic knee joint, the
   Ottawalk-Variable Speed (OWVS), was designed to address these
   limitations. This paper presents a pilot test to evaluate the OWVS
   functional performance during walking and stair descent. A carbon-fiber
   KAFO was adjusted for an able-bodied participant by a certified
   orthotist, with a standard orthotic single axis knee joint on the medial
   side and the OWVS on the lateral side. The participant performed level
   ground walking (stance-control, open, closed) and stair descent tests.
   The operator was able to manually switch between closed mode in terminal
   swing to open mode in terminal stance for stance-control walking. Knee
   angle kinematics were similar between open and stance control modes. For
   stair descent, resistance settings supported the participant as they
   lowered their body to the next step, but with smaller range of motion
   compared to the open setting. The Ottawalk-Variable Speed design
   successfully controls knee flexion during stance and stair descent, with
   one lateral control joint. Mode switching was fast and appropriate. This
   microprocessor controlled SCKAFO has a low profile that fits beneath
   clothing and the variable resistance design will allow people to
   negotiate different terrain types.}},

Abstract = {{An exploratory analysis is carried out to investigate the feasibility of
   using BioImpedance Spectroscopy (BIS) parameters, measured on scalp, as
   real-time feedback during Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation
   (tDCS). TDCS is shown to be a potential treatment for neurological
   disorders. However, this technique is not considered as a reliable
   clinical treatment, due to the lack of a measurable indicator of
   treatment efficacy. Although the voltage that is applied on the head is
   very simple to measure during a tDCS session, changes of voltage are
   difficult to interpret in terms of variables that affect clinical
   outcome. BIS parameters are considered as potential feedback parameters,
   because: 1) they are shown to be associated with the DC voltage applied
   on the head, 2) they are interpretable in terms of conductive and
   capacitive properties of head tissues, 3) physical interpretation of BIS
   measurements makes them prone to be adjusted by clinically controllable
   variables, 4) BIS parameters are measurable in a cost-effective and safe
   way and do not interfere with DC stimulation.
   This research indicates that a quadratic regression model can predict
   the DC voltage between anode and cathode based on parameters extracted
   from BIS measurements. These parameters are extracted by fitting the
   measured BIS spectra to an equivalent electrical circuit model. The
   effect of clinical tDCS variables on BIS parameters needs to be
   investigated in future works. This work suggests that BIS is a potential
   method to be used for monitoring a tDCS session in order to adjust,
   tailor, or personalize tDCS treatment protocols.}},

   when the boundary of P is between two concentric spheres of radii gamma

   theta, we prove that the skeleton is a t-spanner, where t depends only
   on R/r and theta. One of the ingredients in the proof is a tight upper
   bound on the geometric dilation of a convex cycle that is contained in

Abstract = {{In this work, a strategic deep trenching with theoretical optimization
   is adopted to reach a successful reflective effect of WTC structure. The
   experimental results are within the reasonable range. We select the SOS
   refractive index difference of 0.75\%, waveguide core size of 5.5 mu m x
   5.5 mu m. We know, only the trench bottom is at the same depth as the
   waveguide core, the side-wall can reflect the guided-mode from an input
   waveguide to an output waveguide, so set the trenching depth of 26 mu m,
   which is realized with the inductively coupled plasma (ICP) dry etching
   technique. Such a deep trenching process has to face the critic
   challenge in the bottom position and angle of trench side-wall as well
   as the roughness. At 1.55 mu m wavelength, we have experimentally
   observed the output guided-mode and then measure the average optical
   loss of each WTC structure is 11 dB, implying that an optical reflective
   efficiency of 8\% has been reached.}},

Abstract = {{Consequent to authors' previous work on developing a coverage control
   algorithm using multiple autonomous agents/robots, this paper focuses on
   implementing real-time simulations of the previously published coverage
   control algorithm using differential drive mobile robots. Mobile robots
   are deployed in a planar area subject to a suitable nonuniform scalar
   metric. In particular, we deploy multiple P3-DX differential drive
   mobile robots in a two-dimensional planar workspace to be covered where
   the non-uniform metric is defined by density function representing
   scalar measure. A platoon of P3-DX robots is spatially deployed in the
   workspace in such a way that the area coverage is maximized with respect
   the scalar field (density). The density in the workspace defines the
   importance of a point in that workspace. The implementation of the
   coverage optimization algorithm takes advantage of the Voronoi
   tessellation technique to partition the workspace. Each robot then moves
   towards the centroid of the partition (called herein Voronoi cell) it is
   responsible for. The robots are equipped with multiple sensors. Hence,
   the objective is to converge a set of P3-DX robots in a workspace such
   that the coverage is maximized taking into consideration the robots'
   sensory performance and nonuniform density defined throughout the
   workspace. The asymptotic convergence is validated by a set of computer
   simulations using a commercially available robot simulator that mimics a
   real scenario in an indoor workspace.}},

Abstract = {{The notion of a conceptual model is present in any discussion about the
   modelling and simulation process within the discrete event dynamic
   system domain (Robinson 2011). This paper presents an overview on an
   activity-based conceptual modelling framework: Activity Based Conceptual
   modelling = ABCmod (Birta and Arbez 2013). It transforms the general
   notion of a conceptual model to into a specific conceptual modelling
   artefact. The ABCmod framework encompasses the naturalness of the
   activity perspective which has considerable intuitive appeal (Pidd 2004a
   and 2004b). ABCmod accommodates both the structural and the behavioral
   aspects that are fundamental components of any conceptual model and
   provides a collection of constructs both for handling input/output and
   for dealing with special circumstances such as pre-emption, interruption
   and balking. We provide an overview of the framework and illustrate many
   of its features in examples.}},

Abstract = {{We present a fully automated technique to detect nondeterminism in state
   diagrams. Although nondeterminism is a tool often adopted by requirement
   engineers for specification of a system under development (SUD), it is
   normally undesirable in actual implementation. Discovering
   nondeterminism manually is infeasible for industrial-sized systems.
   Solutions in the literature lack the capability to analyze
   infinite-state systems. We leverage the nuXmv model checker to analyze
   unbounded domains and implement an algorithm that systematically
   computes a minimal set of comparable transitions for the SUD yet
   eliminates false positives by model checking. To validate our approach,
   we analyze a real-world system and report discovered cases of
   nondeterminism. We employ Umple's capability to convert state machines
   to nuXmv.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic Routing (OR) protocols are known as a promising research
   area with the aim of delivering data packets to their destination more
   reliably. Security of such protocols, however, is still an open, and
   challenging research problem. In this paper, we propose an enhancement
   on OR protocols which benefits from an appropriate candidate
   coordination mechanism, and assists in salvaging data packets that are
   dropped by malicious nodes. More precisely, an analytical approach is
   proposed using Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) to model a packet
   salvaging mechanism in an OR-based wireless network, while malicious
   nodes attempt in degrading the network performance. The proposed model
   demonstrates how back-up candidates in the candidate set can help in
   salvaging dropped packets by supervising the behavior of other peers in
   the candidate set. Different network parameters including packet
   delivery, drop, salvage, and direct-delivery ratio are then extracted
   from the introduced model. Furthermore, the model is applied on a
   well-known OR protocol and is evaluated using both analytical approach,
   and network simulations. Evaluation results represent that the
   introduced model can dramatically boost the performance of a wireless
   network by delivering greater number of packets to their destination
   compared to a baseline protocol.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes and evaluates a multi-objective strongly typed
   genetic programming algorithm for the discovery of network expressions
   in DNA sequences. Using 13 realistic data sets, we compare the results
   of our tool, MotifGP, to that of DREME, a state-of-the-art program.
   MotifGP outperforms DREME when the motifs to be sought are long, and the
   specificity is distributed over the length of the motif. For shorter
   motifs, the performance of MotifGP compares favourably with the
   state-of-the-art method. Finally, we discuss the advantages of
   multi-objective optimization in the context of this specific motif
   discovery problem.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic annotation technologies support the extraction of legal
   concepts, for example rights and obligations, from legal documents. For
   software engineers, the final goal is to identify compliance
   requirements a software system has to fulfill in order to comply with a
   law or regulation. That implies analyzing and annotating legal documents
   in prescriptive natural language, still an open problem for research in
   the field. In this paper we describe GaiusT 2.0, a system for extracting
   requirements from legal documents. GaiusT 2.0 is the result of the
   evolution of GaiusT, and has been designed and implemented as a
   web-based system intended to semi-automate the extraction process.
   Results of the application of GaiusT 2.0 show that the new version
   improves performance of the extraction process and also makes the tool
   more usable.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) has attracted significant attention
   from cloud research communities. While compute and storage resource
   management has been developed and studied to a greater extent, the use
   of network resource management in the context of IaaS is still in its
   early stages. There is a need for a comprehensive virtualization
   framework capable of providing users with low-level network and compute
   resource control while improving underlying resource utilization. We
   propose a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) IaaS framework that
   explicitly integrates network virtualization, including computing and
   storage, into a cloud platform. Our proposed framework abstracts
   data-center compute and network resources into a virtualized pool of
   resources, links them to logically compose virtual networks, and
   performs automated configurations to serve IaaS requests from users. We
   designed and constructed an SDN test-bed to verify the operation of the
   proposed framework. We successfully demonstrated our system's ability to
   meet our design objectives: (i) providing high degree of control over
   connectivity and Quality of Service (QoS), (ii) fully automated service
   delivery, (iii) fast and low overhead resource provisioning. We
   evaluated the feasibility and scalability of the proposed framework
   using statistics gathered from its deployment.}},

   Crowdsourced knowledge is an essential resource for many developers yet
   it can raise concerns about the quality of the shared content. Most
   existing research efforts address the quality of answers posted by Q\&A
   community members. In this paper, we explore the quality of questions
   and propose a method of predicting the score of questions on Stack
   Overflow based on sixteen factors related to questions' format, content
   and interactions that occur in the post. We performed an extensive
   investigation to understand the relationship between the factors and the
   scores of questions. The multiple regression analysis shows that the
   question's length of the code, accepted answer score, number of tags and
   the count of views, comments and answers are statistically significantly
   associated with the scores of questions. Our findings can offer insights
   to community-based Q\&A sites for improving the content of the shared

Abstract = {{Semiotic engineering is based upon the semiotic theory of Human-Computer
   Interaction (HCI), which focuses on communication between designers and
   users. Semiotic engineering tries to improve users' interpretation
   through metacommunication and emphasizes that designers should play the
   role of legitimate interlocutors in interactive systems. On the other
   hand, there is a gap in software engineering on how to obtain systems
   specifications efficiently, how to create easy-to-understand and
   communicative models, and how to produce comprehensive modeling
   languages and development processes. In this paper, we explore several
   contributions of semiotic engineering to software engineering and
   discuss how the theory can facilitate the creation of comprehensive
   artifacts. We also discuss semiotic engineering for assessing and
   improving software modeling languages, in our case UML. We anticipate
   that our work would lead to the semiotic theory becoming recognized as a
   central theory driving software engineering research and practice.}},

Abstract = {{Identification and quantification of foodborne pathogens are becoming
   increasingly important to public health and food safety since the
   majority of foodborne illnesses and deaths are caused by pathogenic
   bacteria. Conventional methods for foodborne pathogen detection are
   time-consuming and laborious due to the requirement of a series of
   processes including cell enrichment, isolation and morphological
   identification. Therefore the demand for rapid, sensitive, inexpensive
   and convenient approaches to detect foodborne pathogenic bacteria has
   emerged in recent years. Among the new approaches, microfluidic
   chip-based detection has generated growing interest because of the
   miniaturized size, improved sensitivity and reduced detection time of
   the devices. In addition, the applications of nanomaterials and magnetic
   microbeads have further facilitated target recognition and signal
   transduction processes in microfluidic pathogen detection. The
   lab-on-a-chip technique has developed into an alternative to
   conventional methods to detect foodborne pathogens owing to its
   potentials to offer desired sensitivity and to respond in a short test
   time. Most recently, smartphones and 3-D printing technologies are
   attracting growing attention for enhanced detection performances. This
   paper reviews the most recent developments and trends in miniaturized
   microfluidic devices based on different recognition principles and
   signal amplification methods to detect foodborne pathogens. In
   particular, emphasis will be put on those that offer both rapid
   detection result turn-around and ultra-low detection limit of 10(2) to
   10(3) cells per mL or even single-cell detection.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a framework used for decision support by
   intelligent agents in transportation environments: assisting drivers in
   making effective travel decisions based on traffic reports provided by
   peers. Operating with a proposed multifaceted trust model for judging

   ontological representation that makes possible the kind of detailed
   trust modeling essential for the decision making. In so doing, we are
   offering a framework that clarifies the representation and the messaging
   required to enable the trust-based decision making to be run. We
   demonstrate how this representation assists in the clarification of
   knowledge provenance and how it can be employed in real-time. We outline
   the effectiveness of the framework through an extensive simulation of
   travel time by vehicles controlled with our specific trust modeling. As
   such, we are able to demonstrate the importance of our ontological
   representation in enabling multi-faceted trust modeling, leading to
   important advice for the field of multiagent trust for decision support.}},

Abstract = {{Oscillatory Behavior-based Signal Decomposition (OBSD) is a new
   technique which employs Morphological Component Analysis (MCA) and the
   Tunable Q-factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT) to decompose a signal into
   components consisting of different oscillatory behaviors rather than
   different frequency bands or scales. Due to the low oscillatory
   transients of bearing fault-induced signals, this method shows promise
   for application to effectively extract bearing fault signatures from raw
   signals contaminated by interferences and noise. In this paper, the
   application of OBSD to bearing fault signature extraction is
   investigated. It is shown that the quality of the results obtained via
   the OBSD is highly dependent on the selection of method-related
   parameters. The effects of each parameter on the performance of the OBSD
   for bearing fault signature extraction are investigated. The analysis is
   also validated by implementing the OBSD on experimental data collected
   from a test rig with a defective bearing.}},

Abstract = {{Vibration analysis is currently the most efficient, non-invasive way to
   monitor the condition of the gears. Faults in gears can be of two
   distinct types, distributed or local. Many fault detection methods are
   effective for one type of fault or the other but not both. Also, many
   methods have the inconvenience that they are not simple and/or require
   initial information about the state of gear. In this paper, several
   methods are proposed with the objective of finding a filter-free, simple
   and efficient method for the detection of both types of faults. The
   calculus enhanced energy operator (CEEO), previously designed for fault
   detection in bearings, is proposed here for the first time on gears. Two
   new methods, the EO123 and EO23, based on the original energy operator
   are also proposed and evaluated. All the proposed methods are filter
   free, computationally simple and can handle a certain level of noise and
   interference. With the exception of low rotational frequencies of the
   gears, it is demonstrated via simulated and experimentally obtained
   signals that the CEEO method can handle noise better than the other
   proposed methods and that the E023 method can handle interference better
   than the others. Different conditions determine the effectiveness of the
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{The advent of affordable virtual reality (VR) headmounted displays
   (HMDs) has sparked significant research activity for creating new
   principles and algorithms to enable the display of VR content on these
   devices. However, the development of current VR content is mostly
   limited to experts using proprietary tools and protocols. A major goal
   of VR is to allow multiple people to meet and collaborate in the same
   virtual space, but the implementation time and complexity of creating
   multi-user 3D environments and games is presently a large barrier to
   entry for developers. This paper presents a web-based architecture that
   combines a 3D graphics framework using HTML-like markup with a Document
   Object Model (DOM) synchronization technique to enable the simple
   creation of social, user generated, and persistent virtual worlds. By
   ensuring that relevant 3D scene data remains in the DOM and that
   synchronization takes place using a novel DOM synchronization mechanism,
   a social VR experience is created that allows multiple users to
   collaboratively modify the 3D environment in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{In a multilabel classification problem, each object gets associated with
   multiple target labels. Graded multilabel classification (GMLC) problems
   go a step further in that they provide a degree of association between
   an object and each possible label. The goal of a GMLC model is to learn
   this mapping while minimizing a certain loss function. In this paper, we
   tackle GMLC problems from a Granular Computing perspective for the first
   time. The proposed schemes, termed as partitive granular cognitive maps
   (PGCMs), lean on Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) whose input concepts
   represent cluster prototypes elicited via Fuzzy C-Means whereas the
   output concepts denote the set of existing labels. We consider three
   different linkages between the FCM's input and output concepts and learn
   the causal connections (weight matrix) through a Particle Swarm
   Optimizer (PSO). During the exploitation phase, the membership grades of
   a test object to each fuzzy cluster prototype in the PGCM are taken as
   the initial activation values of the recurrent network. Empirical
   results on 16 synthetically generated datasets show that the PGCM
   architecture is capable of accurately solving GMLC instances.}},

   shows its advantages in establishing reliability model and conducting
   reliability analysis for complex Phased -Mission Nuclear Power

Abstract = {{This paper presents details regarding the design of two state feedback
   control (SFC) solutions for the position control of a mechatronics
   application represented by the Model 220 Industrial Plant Emulator.
   Since SFC is not effective in terms of zero steady-state control error,
   the SFC structure of both solutions is inserted in a control loop that
   contains a PID controller with or without low-pass filter. This leads to
   the two SFC solutions proposed in this paper and dedicated to
   mechatronics applications with variable moment of inertia. The PID
   controllers are tuned by the Modulus Optimum method to ensure high
   control system performance expressed as increased phase margins and
   improved tracking performance. The performance of the proposed SFC
   solutions is illustrated by case studies that deal with experimentally
   identified parameters in two situations, rigid body dynamics and
   flexible drive dynamics. Simulation and experimental results obtained
   for the three significant values of the moment of inertia of the load
   disk are given.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a latency-aware trust system placement scheme for
   smart grid SCADA networks. Trust systems are specialized security
   devices that are deployed to provide cyber protection to supervisory
   control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Their functionalities
   include firewalling and intrusion detection. They are capable of
   monitoring both types of traffic, ingress and egress. Only a selected
   number of nodes are equipped with trust systems due to budgetary
   constraints. Those nodes are known as the trust nodes. As trust nodes
   are responsible for distributing time critical messages, it is important
   to consider the impact of latency in the selection of trust nodes.
   Network segmentation is a commonly used way of trust node computations.
   This paper proposes a latency-aware segmentation approach that exploits
   the graph theoretic properties of minimum spanning trees (MSTs).
   Numerical results are obtained through case studies for the IEEE BUS 118
   test system topology. The results reveal that the proposed scheme is
   capable of reducing the impact of latency.}},

   that includes spatial dependency is still rather limited. In this paper,
   we introduce a nonuniformly distributed UE model based on the available
   K-tier heterogeneous network. The user model contains an adjustable
   parameter p which represents the spatial dependency between BSs and
   social attractors (SAs) such as bus stops, restaurants, shopping centers
   and so on. UEs are uniformly distributed around SAs in a given radius.
   The expression of the coverage probability is derived. The results

Abstract = {{By exploiting the ever-expanding amount of data on smart devices and

   employed to increase the security of access. However, with the
   popularity of social networks, identification based on behavior over
   social networks is emerging as a novel concept. In this paper, We use
   real traces of data collected over several months. The feature set used
   in the paper includes location of users, their data usage, number of
   sessions and session duration for Facebook, Linkedin, WhatsApp, Skype
   and Twitter applications. The collected feature set is aggregated over

   two challenges encountered even when the problem is constrained. The

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel algorithm for radar-based estimation of
   vital signs in a noncontact, privacy friendly manner while subjects are
   in motion. Unlike the traditional methods that merely use the Fourier
   spectrum of the output of the radar receiver to obtain estimates of
   breathing and heart rates, the proposed algorithm uses time-frequency
   approach. From the Time-Frequency Representation (TFR) of the output of
   a pseudo-random binary Phase Modulated Continuous Wave (PMCW) radar,
   frequency of the maximum amplitude at every time instant is estimated
   and a timeseries of dominant frequencies is formed. MUSIC algorithm is
   then applied to estimate the vital signs from this series. The proposed
   algorithm is demonstrated using simulated and real data. Simulated data
   is obtained through modeling the output of a PMCW radar. Real data is
   obtained by monitoring a walking subject for 10 minutes in a realistic
   setting with a 24.125 GHz PMCW radar. The vital sign estimates obtained
   using the proposed method are found to match closely the estimates from
   wearable devices that were applied to provide the ground truth for
   breathing and heart rates.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate knowledge of the solar resource is required for solar energy
   generation projects, including preferably data for both the direct
   normal (DNI) and diffuse horizontal (DHI) components of irradiance, but
   in many solar datasets, only a single global horizontal (GHI) may be
   available. This paper undertakes the evaluation of three
   models-Reindl{*}, BRL and DISC - which estimate DNI and DHI in such
   cases. The models are tested against actual data from Boulder, USA, and
   Al-Hanakiyah, Saudi Arabia. Generally, a good correlation between hourly
   measured or calculated DNI and hourly modeled DNI is observed for the
   three models in Boulder and Al-Hanakiyah. The three models overestimate
   DNI in Al\_Hanakiyah while Reindl{*} and BRL model exhibit less bias for
   estimating DNI in Boulder. The results show that the BRL model
   outperforms other models in Boulder with RMSE of 121 W/m(2) and standard
   deviation (sigma) of 121 W/m(2). Overestimation of DNI has been noticed
   in BRL and Reindl{*} models with values that exceed 1100 W/m(2). On the
   other hand, Reindl{*} model's performance is better with MBE of 28
   W/m(2)., MAE of 63 W/m(2), and RMSE of 86 W/m(2) in Al-Hanakiyah. Other
   locations such as Ottawa, Canada and Ma'an, Jordan as well as DIRINT
   model will be included to evaluate the performance of each model under
   different weather conditions in the future.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates the design of a rectenna to operate over wide
   dynamic input power range. It utilizes an adaptive reconfigurable
   rectifier to overcome the issue of early breakdown voltage in
   conventional rectifiers. A depletion-mode field-effect transistor has
   been introduced to operate as a switch and compensate at low and high
   input power levels for the rectifier. In addition, a meandered monopole
   antenna has been exploited to collect RF energy. The rectifier design
   achieves 40\% of RF-DC power conversion efficiency over a wide dynamic
   input power range from -17 dBm to 27 dBm and the antenna exhibits a
   directivity of 1.92 dBi as well as a return loss of -33 dB. The rectenna
   is designed to operate in the 900 MHz ISM band and suitable for Wireless
   Power Transfer (WPT) applications.}},

Abstract = {{Appropriate control strategies for power sharing between multiple
   generation units operating in parallel are required to create a stable
   AC microgrid bus. In this paper, we explore the droop control strategy,
   implemented by power electronics units, to maintain a stable AC bus
   voltage without the need for a separate (central) communication layer.
   In particular, our suggested control method is based on adaptive
   control. Fundamentally in microgrids, due to the effects of feeder and
   line impedance, the droop control method is subject to real and reactive
   power coupling and steady-state reactive power sharing errors, and in
   particular for complex microgrid configurations, the reactive power
   sharing poses certain challenges. To improve the reactive power sharing
   equalization, an enhanced adaptive strategy has been utilized to
   calculate a droop coefficient for reactive power control, where the
   reactive power error has been compensated through the injection of small
   real power disturbances. Root locus analysis of a representative
   microgrid has been undertaken to confirm that stable solutions are
   feasible.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies cyber security planning issues in
   resource-constrained smart grid networks. In particular, it proposes a
   centrality-based trust system placement scheme for energy SCADA systems.
   It aims to utilize centrality measurements to improve cyber protection
   in resource-constrained scenarios. The role of centrality measurements
   is to rank nodes based on their importance in a network. Trust systems
   are specialized security devices that are capable of firewalling and
   network intrusion detection. They monitor both types of traffic, ingress
   and egress. They are mainly deployed to provide cyber protection to
   supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems. Due to
   budgetary constraints, only a selected number of nodes are equipped with
   trust systems. Those nodes are known as the trust nodes. The proposed
   scheme uses linear programming problem (LPP) formulations to select the
   trust nodes. Numerical results are obtained through case studies for the
   IEEE BUS 30 and BUS 57 test system topologies. The results reveal that
   the proposed scheme is capable of improving quality of cyber protection

Abstract = {{The key elements for understanding power consumption of a typical home
   are related to the activities that users are performing, the time at
   which appliances are used, and the interdependencies with other
   appliances that may be used concurrently. This information can be
   extracted from context rich smart meters big data. However, the main
   challenge is how to mine complex interdependencies among different
   appliances usage within a home where multiple concurrent data streams
   are occurring. Furthermore, generation of energy consumption data from a
   smart meter is an ongoing continuous process and over period of time
   inter-appliance associations can change or new ones can establish. In
   this paper, we propose incremental mining of frequent power consumption
   patterns from smart meters big data. Our model exploits the benefits of
   pattern growth strategy and mine in quantum of 24 hour period, i.e.
   frequent patterns are extracted from data comprising of appliance usage
   tuples for 24 hours period, in a progressive manner. The details and the

Abstract = {{Policy specification languages such as XACML often provide mechanisms to
   resolve dynamic conflicts that occur when trying to determine if a
   request should be permitted or denied access by a policy. Examples
   include ``deny-overrides{''} or ``first-applicable.{''} Such algorithms
   are primitive and potentially a risk for corporate computer security.
   While they can be useful for resolving dynamic conflicts, they are not
   justified for conflicts that can be easily detected statically. It is
   better to find those at compile time and remove them before run time.
   Many different approaches have been used for static conflict detection.
   However, most of them do not scale well because they rely on pair-wise
   comparison of the access control logic of policies and rules. We propose
   an extension of a Prolog-based expert system approach due to Eronen and
   Zitting. This approach uses constraint logic programming techniques
   (CLP), which are well-adapted to hierarchical XACML policy logic and
   avoid pair-wise comparisons altogether by taking advantage of Prolog's
   built-in powerful indexing system. We demonstrate that expert systems
   can indeed detect conflicts statically, even those that are generally
   believed to only be detectable at run time, by inferring the values of
   attributes that would cause a conflict. As a result, relying on the
   XACML policy combining algorithms can be avoided in most cases except in
   federated systems. Finally we provide performance measurements for two
   different architectures represented in Prolog and give some analysis.}},

   systems. One alternative to deploy such systems is the use of Federated
   Identity Management systems. We argue that it is possible to use
   identity federations to automate the digital certificate issuance and
   use these certificates to authenticate back into federations. We use the
   data provided by the user's identity provider to build his certificate,
   reducing the costs of maintaining several registration authorities and
   simplifying the certificate issuance process. Making the process simpler
   to the users, we also encourage them to request and use their
   certificates. In special, the use of digital certificates for
   authentication can improve the usability and security of the
   authentication process. Furthermore, we present a prototype proving the
   feasibility of our proposal, as well as a discussion of the security and

   inventory management as a service for supply chain stakeholders. The
   offered service will enable all stakeholders in a supply chain to
   minimize both their ordering costs and their shortage costs, while
   managing their inventories. The proposed cloud-based platform stores all
   the data, relating to a given product item, released by the involved
   stakeholders throughout its life cycle; from its manufacture up to its
   retail, passing through its distribution, storage, etc. The objective of
   the offered service is to provide stakeholders, in a supply chain, with
   efficient replenishment schemes derived collaboratively on the basis of
   real-time information flow, including retail information. A stakeholder
   calls the proposed service in order to compute a real-time optimal
   ``inventory threshold{''}, with regard to a given product category, to
   be considered in its replenishment policy. By optimal we mean that it
   minimizes the stock disruption likelihood, while minimizing the
   allocated resources in term of storage space and inventory cash value.
   The computation of the optimal parameters is based on a probabilistic
   model. Analytical results illustrate the efficiency of the inventory
   optimization service offered by our proposed cloud-centric platform.}},

Abstract = {{The choice of a suitable path for packet transmission represents a
   fundamental issue to any routing protocol. The principle of choosing the
   shortest path is also no longer a good option for route selection since
   many other aspects may influence communication performance. In that
   sense, the link quality of the path is more important than the length of
   the path in a wireless network because of the unstable conditions of the
   channel. Expected Transmission Count (ETX) is a widely-used routing
   metric, which servers into the selection of the path with fewer
   transmissions for a successful packet delivery. However, other factors
   should be also considered for route selection, such as the
   re-transmission delay. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis on the
   effect of the link layer delay to the transmission throughput is
   presented and discussed. Given the analysis outcome, this work proposes
   a routing metric based on the link layer delay for IEEE 802.11. This
   metric allows to determine the delay of each hop along the path to
   evaluate the quality of the path as whole. Experimental simulation
   results reveal that the proposed routing metric achieves better results
   when compared to two other known approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity of a fixed Gaussian MIMO channel and the optimal
   transmission strategy under the total power (TP) constraint and full
   channel state information are well-known. This problem remains open in
   the general case under individual per-antenna (PA) power constraints,
   while some special cases have been solved. These include a full-rank
   solution for the MIMO channel and a general solution for the MISO
   channel. In this paper, the Gaussian MISO channel is considered and its
   capacity as well as optimal transmission strategies are determined in a
   closed form under the joint total and per-antenna power constraints in
   the general case. In particular, the optimal strategy is hybrid and
   includes two parts: first is equal-gain transmission and second is
   maximum-ratio transmission, which are responsible for the PA and TP
   constraints respectively. The optimal beamforming vector is given in a
   closed-form and an accurate yet simple approximation to the capacity is
   proposed.}},

Abstract = {{A discrete compound channel with memory is considered, where no
   stationarity, ergodicity or information stability is required, and where
   the uncertainty set can be arbitrary. When the discrete noise is
   additive but otherwise arbitrary and there is no cost constraint on the
   input, it is shown that the causal feedback does not increase the
   capacity. This extends the earlier result obtained for general channels
   with full transmitter (Tx) channel state information (CSI). It is
   further shown that, for this compound setting and under a mild technical
   condition on the additive noise, the addition of the full Tx CSI does
   not increase the capacity either, so that the worst-case and compound
   channel capacities are the same, thus revealing a saddle-point property.}},

Abstract = {{Data streams, where an instance is only seen once and where a limited
   amount of data can be buffered for processing at a later time, are
   omnipresent in today's real-world applications. In this context,
   adaptive online ensembles that are able to learn incrementally have been
   developed. However, the issue of handling data that arrives
   asynchronously has not received enough attention. Often, the true class
   label arrives after with a time-lag, which is problematic for existing
   adaptive learning techniques. It is not realistic to require that all
   class labels be made available at training time. This issue is further
   complicated by the presence of late-arriving, slowly changing dimensions
   (i.e., late-arriving descriptive attributes). The aim of active learning
   is to construct accurate models when few labels are available. Thus,
   active learning has been proposed as a way to obtain such missing labels
   in a data stream classification setting. To this end, this paper
   introduces an active online ensemble (AOE) algorithm that extends online
   ensembles with an active learning component. Our experimental results
   demonstrate that our AOE algorithm builds accurate models against much
   smaller ensemble sizes, when compared to traditional ensemble learning
   algorithms. Further, our models are constructed against small,
   incremental data sets, thus reducing the number of examples that are
   required to build accurate ensembles.}},

Abstract = {{In this contribution, a new binaural beamforming algorithm for hearing
   aids is introduced in order to generate binaural outputs with a good
   trade-off between noise reduction and binaural noise cues preservation.
   This includes cues preservation for the directional noise sources as
   well as diffuse-like background noise. The new algorithm is based on
   selection and mixing processes in the Time-Frequency domain (T-F) and is
   applicable for realistic T-F decompositions. The selection and mixing
   are done with a classification algorithm based on the complex coherence
   between the standard beamformer outputs and other available signals. To
   validate the performance of the proposed algorithm, simulations have
   been performed using recorded signals provided by a hearing aid
   manufacturer. The results indicate that the proposed algorithm can
   provide a good trade-off between noise reduction and binaural noise cues
   preservation, even for complex acoustic environments.}},

Abstract = {{Steganographic capacity is the maximum amount of data that can be
   communicated over a channel before a passive adversary's ability to
   detect the communication reaches a given threshold. In this work, a
   closed-form expression for the steganographic capacity of
   low-probability of detection (LPD) systems is derived for real-world
   communication channels, i.e., continuous, memoryless, and band-limited,
   when the adversary uses an optimal energy detector to identify the
   communication. Our derivation of the steganographic capacity is based on
   approximations for the true probability density functions when covert
   communication is taking place and when it is not, and we show that the
   maximum absolute percentage error between the true and approximate
   density functions is small under LPD conditions, i.e., low
   signal-to-noise ratio. Furthermore, we show the results of a case study
   where we determine the steganographic capacity of a covert-acoustic LPD

Abstract = {{Credible BGP (C-BGP) is a lightweight alternative to secure BGP. Its
   main design objective is to address signature verification costs and
   deployment challenges associated with S-BGP. To this end, C-BGP defines
   a control layer of trusted ASes that is comprised of major Autonomous
   Systems (ASes) in the network. In this environment a non-trusted AS has
   to verify only the signatures of intermediate ASes between itself and
   the last trusted AS in the AS-PATH. Similarly, the address prefix is
   validated only if it was not previously validated by a trusted AS. This
   scheme works very well as long as the trusted ASes are indeed always
   trustworthy. In this paper we aim to study security impact of malicious
   trusted AS(es) in the network. We develop original and detailed
   analytical and simulation models to study the security of C-BGP and
   demonstrate that it promises very significant savings in terms of
   computational overhead and acceptable security performance in the
   presence of malicious ASes in the network.}},

Abstract = {{Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) transport networks based
   on fixed spectrum grids with Single Line Rate (SLR) wavelengths have
   difficulty managing the exponential growth and heterogeneity of data
   traffic, and the rapidly expanding Data Center Interconnect (DCI)
   market. Alternatively, higher scalability can be achieved by adopting
   Mixed Line Rate (MLR) architecture and Elastic Optical Network (EON)
   architecture, which is enabled through the use of Optical Orthogonal
   Frequency Division Multiplexing (O-OFDM) technology. In this paper, we
   develop heuristics for the design and planning of optical transport
   networks using the aforementioned architecture options. We use these
   heuristics to compare the total cost of the innovative elastic network
   with respect to conventional DWDM networks (SLR and MLR) operating in
   different reference network models, and under different traffic
   patterns. Our simulation results provide equipment vendors and network
   operators economic-related insight regarding the cost benefits of the
   elastic OFDM-based paradigm for the operation of future-proof data
   center optical networking.}},

Abstract = {{Electromagnetic radiation signals from computer displays can be a
   computer security risk if the radiation signal is intercepted and
   reconstructed. In addition to the information displayed by the computer,
   electromagnetic radiation leaks the information of the computer itself
   which is more important for some attackers, protectors and security
   inspection workers. In this paper, we demonstrate that electromagnetic
   radiation signals of computer LCD vary considerably between different
   devices and analyzed the reason by checking main circuits of computer
   LCD. Furthermore, this paper proposes the concept of the emanation
   fingerprint and uses high-order cumulants to extract the features of
   computer LCD emanations to construct the emanation fingerprint. The
   proposed fingerprint algorithm (EF algorithm) can realize the individual
   recognition of computer LCDs automatically and accurately without
   reconstruction of the display image.}},

Abstract = {{The convergence of the proliferation of inexpensive high quality video
   cameras, the current global security-aware environment, and increasing
   capability of newer generation computer hardware enables the use of
   computational resources to aid human operators in the video surveillance
   task by not only alerting on scene change detection, but providing
   alerts based on object classification. Current techniques used in
   real-time classification of video objects tend to use fast classifiers,
   such as linear support vector machines and decision trees due to the
   historic limitation of computational resources. Furthermore, the
   features fed to these classifiers tend to be small in size or sparse,
   again, due to limited computational resources. The new computational
   devices, which are now readily available, provide the resources to
   enable non-linear classification techniques, such as complex neural
   networks operating on large dense feature vectors, and convolutional
   neural networks. In this paper, we compare and evaluate several neural
   network architectures and their corresponding features that are capable
   of classifying several video objects in real-time against the Pascal
   2007 dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks provide a way to monitor a region of interest.
   Incorporating a robot into the sensor network provides a basis for other
   types of functionality to be added. One possibility is the replacement
   of damaged sensors with excess sensors within the wireless sensor
   network. This scenario has been defined as the ``Robot-Assisted Sensor
   Relocation{''} (RASR) problem and focused only on minimizing the length
   of the trajectory taken by the robot. RASR has been recently expanded on
   as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem to examine a more
   realistic scenario by considering the reliability and placement location
   of the passive sensors used for replacement; this new problem is termed
   ``Reliable Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation (RRASR). In this paper, the
   possibility of multiple robots servicing the sensor network is
   considered and the RRASR problem formulation is modified accordingly. In
   addition, load balancing of robots by adding an objective function to
   the MOO representation is included. We refer to this multi-robot version
   as Reliable Multiple Robot-Assisted Sensor Relocation. The performance
   of six state-of-the-art evolutionary MOO algorithms using sensor
   networks of varying sizes and inflicted damage levels is examined.}},

Abstract = {{Modern web frameworks and backend-as-a-service providers make it

   However, it remains difficult for users to dynamically discover and
   instantly make use of the data provided by the plethora of REST APIs in

   reference architecture built on the idea of a scalable NoSQL database
   that allows multiple subscribers to receive instant notifications of
   database changes through the use of a ``livequery{''}. By keeping one
   WebSocket connection open between each client web browser and an Object
   Synchronization Server, this paper shows how data from multiple

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an approach to the optimal fuzzy modeling of a
   nonlinear servo system application represented by an electromagnetic
   actuated clutch system. The nonlinear model of the process is first
   linearized around several operating points of the input-output static
   map of the process. Discrete-time Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy models of
   the process are derived on the basis of the modal equivalence principle,
   and the rule consequents of these T-S fuzzy models contain the
   linearized state-space models of the process. Optimization problems are
   defined which aim the minimization of objective functions (OFs) defined
   as the mean of squared modeling errors (the difference between the
   process output and the fuzzy model output). The variables of the OFs are
   represented by a part of the parameters of the input membership
   functions. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm solves the
   optimization problem and gives the optimal T-S fuzzy models. A set of
   simulation results is included to validate the PSO algorithm-based
   modeling approach and the optimal T-S fuzzy models for the
   electromagnetic actuated clutch system.}},

Abstract = {{Exercises have become an important part of many people's daily life.
   However, inappropriate exercises cannot help exercisers build desired
   muscles, and may even get them hurt. In this paper, we proposed a 3D
   plank-coaching system to guide plank exercisers through fusing
   multimodal data and providing proper haptic feedback to them. Our
   proposed system can measure and fuse the user's muscle movements,
   posture, and several physiological parameters information, which are
   collected from Electromygraphy (EMG) sensors, Kinect v2 sensors,
   Electrocardiography (ECG) sensors, and thermometer. Based on comparison
   results between the user's fused data and the standard data, our system
   can activate the corresponding vibrotactile actuators, embedded in our
   developed haptic clothes, to suggest the correct adjustments. As a
   result, our system can improve the user' plank exercise quality and
   decrease his/her injury risk.}},

Abstract = {{Aeronautical ad hoc networks (AANETs) can have a hybrid topology of
   intermittently connected clusters and mesh network. The hybrid network
   topology compounded with highly dynamic nature of AANET leads to
   variable connectivity in the network. The connectivity in the network
   for direct air-to-air communication between aircrafts is primarily a
   function of velocity of air vehicles, position of air vehicles,
   direction of flight, range of communication and congestion. In this
   paper, we present a connectivity prediction model for the AANET. The
   proposed model does a space time analysis of connectivity in the regions
   of AANET. The model can identify areas of low connectivity in a region
   by grading connectivity in the AANET. The connectivity prediction
   complements the change in state of an aircraft as it joins the AANET in
   a cluster or mesh. The model directs idle or migrating members of the
   network to the higher regions of connectivity. Connectivity gradation
   reduces network setup time in the events of network disruptions,
   strengthening the network's self-healing capability. FCM clustering is
   used for translating 3D topology of the network in conjunction with
   network traffic to multiple domains, that represent an aircraft.}},

Abstract = {{With regulations influencing almost all societal interactions, divergent
   views about their relevance and performance exist today. In
   consideration of the time and cost implication involved in complying,
   regulated parties often complain of overregulation. Governments,
   motivated to ensure the safety, security and prosperity of their
   communities, insist on effective and efficient regulations and advocate
   for more. Additionally, citizens and interest groups advocate for more
   or fewer regulations depending on perceived benefits to them. This
   scenario puts pressure on regulators mandated to administer regulations.
   They are required to be transparent and accountable in showing the
   performance of regulations while accommodating the concerns of different
   stakeholders involved. In this regard, this doctoral research proposes a
   framework that regulators can use to show the performance of their
   regulations through modeling and measuring regulations and evaluating
   and reporting their outcomes. The Regulator-Oriented Regulatory
   Intelligence Framework (RORIF) adopts a regulatory intelligence approach
   that involves the use of data and takes advantage of the capabilities of
   existing Business Intelligence and analytical tools.}},

Abstract = {{Human motion analysis has numerous applications ranging from gait
   analysis to prosthetic manufacturing. Amongst various techniques, use of
   retroreflective markers placed on skin to estimate the underlying bone
   movement is well established. Most commonly used movement types such as
   flexion, abduction and circumduction often suffer from measurement
   errors due to displacement of markers placed on skin with respect to
   underlying bone. Hence, its use is limited in clinical and biomechanical
   applications. Here, we are elaborating the possibility of using
   ultrasound imaging as an ad hoc to track the movement of underlying
   femur bone during these movements. It is shown that the bone
   displacement varies significantly amongst subjects, movement type and
   probe placement on thigh. This will open the grounds of getting patient
   specific joint movements with more accuracy than motion capture alone.
   The approximated fitting of marker data is often useful but they are not
   seamlessly accurate. Previously {[}17] we have highlighted the use of
   ultrasound imaging to compensate the soft tissue error in finding
   functional hip joint centre through flexion movement. In this paper we
   have explained our methodology of extracting bone edges and tracking the
   underlying bone displacement using ultrasound imaging to compare how
   different movement types affect internal bone movements for different
   subjects which can be extended to be applied to other applications of
   human joint research.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate blood pressure (BP) measurement is critical in the diagnosis
   and management of hypertension, as an error of 5 mmHg can be responsible
   for doubling or halving the number of patients diagnosed with this
   condition. Sensor drift, due to changing environmental factors, such as
   ambient temperature, can contribute to the inaccuracy. Studies also show
   that long term sensor drift, or ageing, can lead to a change of almost 9
   mmHg in blood pressure measurement during the first three months of
   usage. In this work, a new stage is added to current cuff-based BP
   devices. This stage is responsible for adjusting the pressure reading
   before displaying it to end users, by monitoring changes in the ambient
   temperature and sensor ageing and adaptively compensating for these
   inaccuracies. These sources of inaccuracy are suppressed using
   algorithms based on Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD), which has the
   feature of removing unwanted noise components without affecting the
   phase or the frequency distribution of the measured signal.}},

   pulse can be modeled and consequently noise and artifacts can be
   reduced. As each sinusoid is precisely expressed by its amplitude, phase
   and frequency, the proposed method provides a compressed representation
   of the oscillometric pulses. We show that the proposed method achieves a
   compression ratio of 60/HR F-s/2N+4', Where HR 2N+4, HR is the heart
   rate in beats/min, F-S is the sampling frequency in Hz, and N is the
   number of harmonics considered in the model. New methods for detecting,
   replacing, and correcting the outliers based on the characteristics of
   the outlier neighboring pulses are also proposed in this paper.}},

   broadband negative refraction passband from 41GHz to 62GHz with very low
   dispersion from 47GHz to 57GHz. In addition, the retrieved refractive
   index is examined by Kramers-Kronig relations. The metamaterial with

Abstract = {{This paper deals with the testing of distributed systems. An
   implementation under test is checked for conformance with the properties
   defined by a reference specification. Since distributed systems usually
   have multiple interfaces, the reference specification will not define
   the order of all pairs of interactions taking place at different
   interfaces. Therefore a specification formalism supporting the
   definition of partial orders is required. Different such formalisms are
   compared in this paper, including MSC-Charts (or Interaction Overview
   Diagrams). A variation of this formalism, called Partial-Order-Charts
   (PO-Charts) is proposed which makes abstraction from the exchange of
   messages. It concentrates on the specification of partial orders between
   local actions in different system components. It is shown that the
   partial-order testing approach introduced for a single partial order
   specification can be adapted to testing PO-Charts which define various
   combinations of different partial orders which are sequenced by strict
   or week sequencing, including loops. Various examples are given to
   compare this testing approach with state machine testing methods which
   can be applied for bounded PO-Charts for which one can derive an
   equivalent state machine. The testing complexities and fault model
   assumptions of these two approaches are compared.}},

Abstract = {{Previous experiments have revealed that shock waves driven through
   dissipative gases may become unstable, for example, in granular gases.
   The mechanisms controlling these instabilities are not well understood.
   Two-dimensional event-driven Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were
   previously completed to investigate the stability of piston driven shock
   waves through dilute granular gases. By considering viscoelastic
   collisions, allowing for finite dissipation within the shock wave,
   instabilities were found in the form of distinctive high density
   non-uniformities and convective rolls within the shock structure. This
   work is now extended to the continuum level. Euler and Navier-Stokes
   equations for granular gases are modelled with a modified cooling rate
   to include an impact threshold necessary for inelastic collisions. The
   shock structure predicted by the continuum formulation is found in good
   agreement with the structure obtained by MD. Introducing strong
   perturbations to the incoming density field, in accordance with the
   spacial fluctuations in the upstream state seen in MD, yields similar
   instabilities as those previously observed. While the inviscid model
   predicts a highly turbulent structure from these perturbations, the
   inclusion of viscosity and heat conductivity yields comparable
   wavelengths of pattern formations to those seen in MD.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a novel maximum-entropy-based 14-moment interpolative
   closure is examined for multidimensional flows via validation of the
   closure for several established benchmark problems. Despite its
   consideration of heat transfer, this 14-moment closure contains
   closed-form expressions for the closing fluxes, unlike the
   maximum-entropy models on which it is based. While still retaining
   singular behaviour in some regions of realizable moment space, the
   interpolative closure proves to have a large region of hyperbolicity
   while remaining computationally tractable. Furthermore, the singular
   nature has been shown to be advantageous for practical simulations. The
   multi-dimensional cases considered here include Couette flow, heat
   transfer between infinite parallel plates, subsonic flow past a circular
   cylinder, and lid-driven cavity flow. The 14-moment predictions are
   compared to analytical, DSMC, and experimental results as well the
   results of other closures. For each case, a range of Knudsen numbers are
   explored in order to assess the validity and accuracy of the closure in
   different regimes. For Couette flow and heat transfer between flat
   plates, it is shown that the closure predictions are consistent with the
   expected analytical solutions in all regimes. In the cases of flow past
   a circular cylinder and lid-driven cavity flow, the closure is found to
   give more accurate results than the related lower-order maximum-entropy
   Gaussian and maximum-entropy-based regularized Gaussian closures. The
   ability to predict important non-equilibrium phenomena, such as a
   counter-gradient heat flux, is also established.}},

Abstract = {{Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is highly prevalent among women, and
   is associated with biomechanical defects in the urogenital system.
   Current approaches to quantifying urogenital mechanics are limited. The
   purpose of this research is to develop semi-automated software that
   compensates for in-plane translational and rotational probe motion
   during kinematic analyses based on dynamic sagittal-plane ultrasound
   imaging. Coordinate systems were constructed in each video frame in
   order to build transformation matrices that would compensate for probe
   motion. Once the transformation matrices were applied to each frame,
   kinematics could be calculated. The kinematics of the bladder neck (BN)
   and anorectal angle (ARA) were calculated in a female presenting with
   mild SUI performing a double-barrel cough. Displacement and velocity
   curves were similar to those reported in the literature, while
   accelerations were difficult to compare due to differences between our
   task and the only task analyzed in the literature. The results appear to
   reflect adequate pelvic floor muscle activation, indicating that in this
   woman, SUI may be due to another urogenital defect, such as urethral
   hypermobility or sphincter deficiency. This paper presents a proof of
   concept for software development. As a next step, inter-and intra-user
   reliability of the software output will be evaluated.}},

Abstract = {{Triaxial inertial sensor data was measured at the wrist and mid-lower
   back location during a 2-minute walk test. A Microsoft Band 2 was used
   to acquire gait data at the wrist and a Samsung Galaxy S5 smartphone was
   placed at the posterior pelvis. Accelerometer and gyroscope signals did
   not correlate well between the two locations. Important gait parameters
   at the wrist may lead to a better understanding of human locomotion
   profile due to periodic trends observed in wrist data. Turn detection
   accuracy was 86.0 +/- 23.1\% and 78.3 +/- 20.2\% for the MSB2 and
   smartphone, respectively. Turn detection showed that the smartphone
   y-axis gyroscope had more distinct peaks. Turn peak analysis showed that

Abstract = {{Current ankle assist devices aim to improve the user's walking ability
   and stability. Despite the success of classical ankle orthoses and
   powered exoskeletons, these devices are still facing challenges that
   drive their continued development. This paper will first introduce the
   distinct types of ankle devices for walking assist. Then, three common
   approaches used in the design and development of these devices will be
   discussed and analyzed. These are inverse dynamics, the inverted
   pendulum model, and the design based on joint quasi-stiffness.
   The inverse dynamics approach simplifies all soft tissue contributions
   to a single force moment couple regardless of the source of the forces,
   thus making the prediction of metabolic cost very difficult. The
   inverted pendulum model is focused on the conservation of energy as the
   center of mass advances. It assumes rigid limb support and does not
   consider the ankle joint or the advancement of the center of pressure
   along the foot. The quasi-stiffness design approach attempts to
   translate the ankle stiffness into a combination of linear zones in
   order to be easily replicated with mechanical spring elements. The
   stiffness of the biological ankle is highly variable and dependent upon
   the speed of walking. Therefore devices using mechanical springs with
   non variable stiffness characteristics will only be effective within a
   narrow range of walking speeds.
   The current challenges faced by passive walking assist devices may be
   due to the methods used to assess the requirements of the body. If the
   parameters advised by these analytical approaches do not match the needs
   of the human body, the resulting devices will be inherently flawed.}},

Abstract = {{The Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) is
   an integrated algorithm employed in the Enhanced Distributed Channel
   Access (EDCA) in the IEEE 802.11p protocol. CSMA/CA manages the access
   of packets to the medium and its main role is to avoid collisions among
   them. An essential process of CSMA/CA is the backoff period in which the
   packets has to wait for a random number of Time Slots (TS) before
   attempting to access the medium. The backoff operation is based on a
   simple deterministic approach that does not consider the status of the
   medium at the time of transmission. In this paper, we propose an
   Adaptive Backoff Algorithm (ABA). ABA is based on a probabilistic
   approach that takes into account the current situation of the medium.
   ABA is calculated as a function of the packets probability of collision.
   We present two algorithms ABA1 and ABA2, the function of the former is
   directly proportional to the collision probability however the function
   of the latter is exponentially dependent on the collision probability.
   We develop a Markov-based analytical model to evaluate ABA1 and ABA2,
   and study the performance of each system.}},

Abstract = {{Optimized task allocation in robotic sensor networks is a crucial yet
   complex problem. A successful allocation must efficiently and rapidly
   coordinate agents to resolve a greater objective while being resilient
   to incomplete contextual information. Prior work introduced a two-step
   task allocation process which first determines a set of suitable robots
   via an auction, then optimizes the task allocation for these agents with
   the use of multiobjective evolutionary algorithms. The first step has
   had success but often yields suboptimal sets in certain conditions, this
   limitation can be traced back to the auctioning protocol's simplicity,
   which then constraints the set of potential coalitions sought by the
   optimizer.
   We introduce two new auction protocols which are able to choose optimal
   agents. These protocols are resilient to communication failures, can
   rapidly determine optimal sets and can select agents based on multiple
   factors. A valuation system which renders agents aware of the value of
   entities is also introduced. Finally, a rigorous experimentation is
   designed to evaluated the performance of the different protocols in
   multiple scenarios.
   In the experiment, both proposed protocols in conjunction with the
   valuation system proved to he efficient methods to select appropriate
   agents. In both sparse and dense network scenarios, the proposed
   protocols performed better than the current implementation in terms of
   selecting appropriate coalitions, at the cost of time and network
   utilization.}},

Abstract = {{Humans have various complex postures and movements. Considerable
   attention is given to the problem of recognizing a human fall. However,
   the recognition rates must be further improved, for practical
   applications, from that obtained in the previous research. In this
   paper, a new recognition method, based on the analysis of a human fall,
   is provided. Furthermore, five eigenvectors that describe a fall are
   defined i.e. the aspect ratio, effective area ratio, human point margin,
   body axis angle, and centrifugal rate of the body contour. Then, a
   support vector machine based on the Gauss radial basis function is
   trained to obtain a better identification result. The simulation results
   show that the model, though the combination of the five eigenvectors,
   has a recognition rate of 94.5\%, which is a significant improvement as
   compared to the previous research.}},

Abstract = {{The ascending increase in the numbers of Plug-in Electric Vehicles
   (PEVs) in the world brought forward many new challenges to the power
   grid and utility networks. Some of these challenges are related to
   finding and managing additional power resources for these PEVs. Green
   power is one of the alternatives but, we still need to find a cheap way
   to store this power, PEVs could play a significant role in storing power
   at a certain time and use it at another time. Never the less, it can
   play the same role with electric power from grids so it can store power
   from off peak time to peak time. This role might help the grid to
   fulfill the growing demands. In this paper, we propose flexible charging
   and discharging algorithm that effectively addresses and solves the
   problem of power demand on peak time using the PEV's batteries as a
   source for backup energy storage. The results show significant
   enhancement in the power consumption without affecting the performance
   of electric vehicle.}},

Abstract = {{In a Public Safety (PS) situation, agents may require critical and
   personally identifiable information. Therefore, not only does context
   and location-aware information need to be available, but also the
   privacy of such information should be preserved. Existing solutions do
   not address such a problem in a PS environment. This paper proposes a
   framework in which anonymized Personal Information (PI) is accessible to
   authorized public safety agents under a PS circumstance. In particular,
   we propose a secure data storage structure along with privacy-preserving
   mobile search framework, suitable for Public Safety Networks (PSNs). As
   a result, availability and privacy of PI are achieved simultaneously.
   However, the design of such a framework encounters substantial
   challenges, including scalability, reliability of the data, computation
   and communication and storage efficiency, etc. We leverage Secure
   Indexing (SI) methods and modify Bloom Filters (BFs) to create a secure
   data storage structure to store encrypted meta-data. As a result, our
   construction enables secure and privacy-preserving multi-keyword search
   capability. In addition, our system scales very well, maintains
   availability of data, imposes minimum delay, and has affordable storage
   overhead. We provide extensive security analysis, simulation studies,
   and performance comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions to
   demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.
   To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to address such
   issues in the context of PSNs.}},

Abstract = {{The detection and recognition of Traffic Signs (TSs) by smart vehicles
   is of great interest. In this paper, we present a novel TSs localisation
   and recognition system using client-server architecture. To the best of
   our knowledge, this is the first architecture that uses non vision-based
   techniques to detect and recognise TSs. To discover TSs in lanes using
   our architecture, each travelling vehicle (known as client in our
   architecture) begins by sending a request, which contains its
   geographical position, to the data server. This server then sends all
   nearby TSs, found within a given radius in the lane, to the requester.
   Finally, we apply a filtering algorithm to select appropriate TSs from
   the previously found set of TSs. Our system can be used in a conjunction
   with a traditional vision-based system to further increase the accuracy
   of the whole system.}},

Abstract = {{The accelerated growth of applications and services in intelligent
   transportation systems (ITS) are driven by interests from the public and
   private sectors. The intent to utilize the on-board resources, along
   with the advanced methods of managing the available computing
   capabilities in the conventional cloud, has led to the high popularity
   of Vehicular Clouds. Likewise in Vehicular Networks, vehicles provide
   the building blocks for forming these particular clouds, which can
   enable a large number of applications and services that can benefit the
   whole transportation system, as well as the drivers, passengers, and
   pedestrians. However, due to its high mobility, Vehicular Clouds show
   several inherent challenges, which increase complexity and restrict the
   design of solutions. Determining the number of vehicles and their time
   of availability in a given region through a model works as a critical
   stepping stone for enabling vehicular clouds, as well as any other
   system involving vehicles moving over the traffic network. Therefore, by
   implementing proper traffic models, we present a comprehensive
   stochastic analysis about the distribution of the number of vehicles
   inside a road segment in this paper. According to real parameters, we
   show that certain classes of applications are feasible even for highly
   mobile scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Soil trenching is extensively used in geotechnical, mining, tunneling
   and geo-environmental infrastructures. Safe height and stand-up time are
   two key factors that are required for the rational design of soil
   trenches. Rainfall infiltration has a significant influence on the safe
   height and stand-up time of unsaturated soil trenches since it can
   significantly alter the shear strength of soils by influencing the
   matric suction. In other words, predicting the variation of matric
   suction of soils associated with rainfall infiltration is vital to the
   design of unsaturated soil trenches. In this paper, finite element
   analysis is carried out to reproduce the variation of matric suction
   profile in unsaturated soil trenches associated with rainfall
   infiltration using the published results of a full scale instrumented
   test trench at the site of BBRI at Limelette, Belgium. The analysis
   results showed that the variation of matric suction in unsaturated soil
   trenches can be reliably estimated using the information of
   environmental factors such as the rainfall measurements.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the formalization of a correctness proof for a conflict
   detection algorithm for XACML (eXtensible Access Control Markup
   Language). XACML is a standardized declarative access control policy
   language that is increasingly used in industry. In practice it is common
   for rule sets to grow large, and contain unintended errors, often due to
   conflicting rules. A conflict occurs in a policy when one rule permits a
   request and another denies that same request. Such errors can lead to
   serious risks involving both allowing access to an unauthorized user as
   well as denying access to someone who needs it. Removing conflicts is
   thus an important aspect of debugging policies, and the use of a
   verified algorithm provides the highest assurance in a domain where
   security is important. In this paper, we focus on several complex XACML
   constructs, including time ranges and integer intervals, as well as ways
   to combine any number of functions using the boolean operators and, or,
   and not. The latter are the most complex, and add significant expressive
   power to the language. We propose an algorithm to find conflicts and
   then use the Coq Proof Assistant to prove the algorithm correct. We
   develop a library of tactics to help automate the proof.}},
