Abstract = {{Morphology applies certain simple rules and shapes, such as squares,
   circles, diamonds, cubes and spheres, to process images. The objective
   is usually to identify features of interest in images as a prelude to
   performing high-level inspection, or machining, functions. Navigating
   around complex objects is facilitated using `anchor point' features
   detected by morphology. The chapter begins by defining four basic
   morphology operations for binary images: erosion, dilation, opening, and
   closing. The application of these operations to analysing images from
   real-world vision tasks is discussed, as are techniques for fast
   implementation. Further operations akin to morphology are also
   described, including skeletonisation, hit-and-miss transform, and binary
   template matching. The extension of binary morphology into grey-scale
   morphology is also described and illustrated.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR THERAPY-NUCLEIC ACIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Researchers have long recognized that the random introduction of new DNA
   into the genome could result in unpredictable genetic effects due to
   bilateral influences between transgenic and endogenous sequences. Hence,
   precise editing or replacement of mutant genes has been a major goal of
   gene therapy since its inception. That goal looked possible with the
   publication of studies demonstrating that targeted cleavage of
   chromosomal sequences and enhanced homologous recombination (HR) could
   be achieved using chimeric molecules composed of a nuclease domain and
   separate, designer DNA-recognition domains.(1,2) Zinc-finger nucleases
   (ZFNs) are artificial endonucleases that consist of a FokI cleavage
   domain tethered to engineered Cys(2)His(2) zinc-finger, DNA-binding
   polypeptides.(3-5) ZFNs have gained considerable momentum and are widely
   considered the most mature nuclease technology in the gene therapy
   field.(6) However, after 15 years in the spotlight, a new chimeric
   nuclease has emerged, Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) Effector
   Nucleases (TALENs).(7-10) Here, we describe functional and design
   characteristics of ZFNs and TALENs and discuss their expanding role as
   tools for research and gene therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs) are persistent
   virtual environments where millions of players interact in an online
   manner. Game logs capture player activities in great detail and user
   behavior modeling approaches can help to build accurate models of player
   behavior from these logs. We are interested in modeling player churn
   behavior and we use a lifecycle-based approach for this purpose. In a
   player lifecycle-based approach, we analyze the activity traits of
   churners in the weeks leading up to their point of leaving the game and
   compare it with the activity traits of a regular player. We identify
   several intuitive yet distinct behavioral profiles associated with
   churners and active players which can discriminate between the two
   populations. We use these insights to propose three semantic dimensions
   of engagement, enthusiasm and persistence to construct derived features.
   Using three session-related variables and the features derived from
   them, we are able to achieve good classification performance with the
   churn prediction models. Finally, we propose a distance-based
   classification scheme, which we call wClusterDist, which benefits from
   these distinct behavioral profiles of the two populations. Experimental
   results show that the proposed classification scheme is well-suited for
   this problem formulation and its performance is better than or
   comparable to other traditional classification schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of gold farmer detection is the problem of detecting players
   with illicit behaviors in massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) and
   has been studied extensively. Detecting gold farmers or other deviant
   actors in social systems is traditionally understood as a binary
   classification problem, but the issue of false negatives is significant
   for administrators as residual actors can serve as the backbone for
   subsequent clandestine organizing. In this paper we address this gap in
   the literature by addressing the problem of false negative estimation
   for gold farmers in MMOs by employing the capture-recapture technique
   for false negative estimation and combine it with graph clustering
   techniques to determine ``hidden{''} gold farmers in social networks of
   farmers and normal players. This paper redefines the problem of gold
   farming as a false negative estimation problem and estimates the gold
   farmers in co-extensive MMO networks, previously undetected by the game
   administrators. It also identifies these undetected gold farmers using
   graph partitioning techniques and applies network data to address rare
   class classification problem. The experiments in this research found
   53\% gold farmers who were previously undetected by the game
   administrators.}},

   to reduce the computational complexity of sparsity methods and improve
   the selection of the regularization parameter, a beam-space technique is
   used to Sparse Spectral Fitting method. Firstly, we use the beamforming
   matrix to transfer element-space data to beam-space. Then, the output
   covariance matrix of beam-space domain will replace the original
   covariance matrix. Finally, we estimate the DOA and power by exploiting
   a sparse representation of the power spectrum. Simulation examples are
   presented to demonstrate the effective of the proposed method. The
   beam-space method not only remains the performances of DOA and power
   estimation of SpSF, but also is much less sensitive to its

Abstract = {{An identification procedure is developed for obtaining spectral
   radiative properties of highly scattering dispersed materials such as
   porous ceramics. Traditional techniques based on measurements of the
   directional-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance are of limited
   use because of difficulties in fabricating sufficiently thin and
   mechanically stable samples to obtain reliable values of
   directional-hemispherical transmittance. However, one can use the
   directional-hemispherical reflectance measurements for optically thick
   samples to obtain the transport scattering albedo. A one-dimensional
   analytical solution employs the modified two-flux approximation for the
   identification of transport scattering albedo. An additional
   transmittance measurement is required to identify the transport
   extinction coefficient. Bi-normal narrow cone transmittance is measured
   for this purpose. Because the one-dimensional analytical solution is not
   applicable to model the bi-normal narrow cone transmittance, Monte Carlo
   ray-tracing technique is used to identify the transport extinction
   coefficient. The identification procedure is applied to obtain
   near-infrared radiative properties of porous ceria ceramics used in
   solar thermochemical reactors. The identified transport scattering
   coefficient is shown to be in good agreement with theoretical estimates
   based on the Mie theory for polydisperse pores and grains. This verifies
   the applicability of a model based on independent scattering and Mie
   theory for theoretical predictions of radiative properties of two types
   of ceria ceramics with porosity of 0.08 and 0.72, and for extrapolating
   the properties of both ceramics in a limited near-infrared range to the
   range of significant absorption.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the problem of global synchronization for

   impulsive synchronization of the network by changing the differences

   main idea discussed in this paper, regardless of whether there is a
   synchronized or desynchronized impulses for the dynamical networks. In
   the previous literature, results are devoted to investigating criterion
   for synchronization with impulsive control on all the nodes in dynamical
   networks. Thus some questions arises: What is the relation between
   strength of impulsive signal and the impulsive interval? How do the
   chosen pinning nodes affect the dynamics of the network? In this paper,
   a synchronization criterion is derived for impulsive dynamical networks
   for pinning control, and clear relations between the strength of
   impulsive signal, the impulsive interval, and pinning nodes are
   provided. Numerical examples are given at last to show the effectiveness

Abstract = {{Several newly approved protein-based therapeutics in the past decade are
   manufactured in modern production plants with automated systems for
   process control and comprehensive data archival. The hundreds of process
   parameters and key output variables for several production batches in
   the vast historical databases provide a valuable resource to improve
   process understanding and robustness. Multivariate data analysis is a
   critical process analytical technology tool to unearth any hidden
   patterns within process trends and identify key parameters for enhancing
   process performance and product quality. Cell culture process data from
   more than hundred ``trains{''} comprising production as well as inoculum
   bioreactors was investigated in this study. Each batch encompasses over
   130 on-line and off-line temporal parameters. A maximum margin support
   vector algorithm was coupled with a kernel-based machine learning
   approach to develop multivariate predictive models for critical cell
   culture performance parameters. A differential weighting scheme was
   incorporated in the model to prioritize the process parameters with
   strong associations with process outcome and to identify key performance
   indicators at every stage of the production train. Model evaluations
   indicate that cell culture performance can be accurately predicted
   several days before harvest and downstream purification. Further,
   multiple parameters in the inoculum and early stages of production
   bioreactors were identified as precocious markers of the final process
   outcome. This process-data driven approach for knowledge discovery in
   manufacturing processes represents an important step towards
   implementing a real-time decision making scheme based on critical
   product and process traits.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method of capturing more energy from the
   wind using short term energy storage in a hydrostatic wind turbine. A
   hydrostatic transmission not only provides reliable operation but also
   enables robust energy management features like energy regeneration using
   hydraulic accumulators. In this study, turbulence-induced wind power
   transients occurring near rated power are exploited to extract more
   energy from the wind. Wind characteristics are analyzed to develop
   models to quantify the potential energy loss due to wind turbulence and
   energy gains from short term storage. A control strategy to achieve the
   above objective is proposed. A mathematical model for a proposed energy
   storage configuration is developed in MATLAB/Simulink. Results show that
   in a 50 kW mid-size wind turbine, the Annual Energy Production (AEP) can
   be increased by nearly 4\% with a 60 liter accumulator.}},

Abstract = {{The heterogeneous oxidation of Zn(g) is considered as an improved
   approach to the production of H-2 and CO in the two-step Zn/ZnO solar
   thermochemical cycle. The rate of Zn(g) oxidation by H2O and CO2 is
   measured gravimetrically in a quartz tubular flow reactor for
   temperatures between 800 and 1150 K, Zn(g) concentrations up to 36
   mol\%, and H2O/CO2 concentrations up to 45 mol\%. The rate of the
   heterogeneous oxidation of Zn(g) by both H2O and CO2 is on the order of
   10(-8)-10(-5) mol cm(-2) s(-1). For similar oxidizing conditions, H2O
   oxidizes Zn(g) three times as fast as CO2, indicative of a lower
   heterogeneous oxidation activation energy in the H2O system. Less than
   one second is required to convert more than 85\% of Zn to ZnO for all
   temperatures in both the H2O and CO2 reacting systems.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of a reactor designed for the hydrolysis of Zn in the
   two-step Zn/ZnO solar thermochemical cycle for hydrogen production is
   explored. Technically, complete hydrolysis of Zn in the hydrogen
   production step remains a major barrier to implementation, and much
   attention has been given to Zn nanoscale reacting aerosols as a
   solution. The success of this continuous process depends on achieving
   high particle yields and high conversions in the aerosol. A key
   challenge is to control the flow field in aerosol reactors to keep the
   particles entrained in the flow without deposition on the reactor wall.
   The ability of a new reactor concept based on transverse jet fluid
   dynamics to control the flow field and rapidly cool the Zn vapor is
   investigated. In the transverse jet reactor, evaporated Zn entrained in
   an Ar carrier gas issues vertically into the horizontal tubular reactor
   through which cooler H2O and Ar flow. Particles are formed in the
   presence of steam at similar to 450K. The trajectory of the jet is
   controlled via the effective velocity ratio, R, which is the square root
   of the ratio of the kinetic energy of the jet to that of the cross-flow.
   A computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model indicates that the trajectory
   of the jet can be controlled so that the majority of the Zn mass is
   directed down the center of the reactor, not near the reactor walls for
   R = 4.25 to R = 4.5. Experimentally, maximum particle yields of 93\% of
   the mass entering the reactor are obtained at R = 4.5.}},

Abstract = {{The redox chemistry of nonstoichiometric metal oxides can be used to
   produce chemical fuels by harnessing concentrated solar energy to split
   water and/or carbon dioxide. In such a process, it is desirable to use a
   porous reactive substrate for increased surface area and improved gas
   transport. The present study develops a macroscopic-scale model of
   porous ceria undergoing thermal reduction. The model captures the
   coupled interactions between the heat and mass transfer and the
   heterogeneous chemistry using a local thermal non-equilibrium (LINE)
   formulation of the volume averaged conservation of mass and energy
   equations in an axisymmetric cylindrical domain. The results of a
   representative test case simulation demonstrate strong coupling between
   gas phase mass transfer and the chemical kinetics as well as the
   pronounced impact of optical thickness on the temperature distribution

Abstract = {{Premixed compression ignition (CI) combustion has attracted increasing
   research effort recently due to its potential to achieve both high
   thermal efficiency and low emissions. Dual-fuel strategies for enabling
   premixed CI have been a focus using a low reactivity fumigant and direct
   diesel injection to control ignition. Alternative fuels like hydrogen
   and ethanol have been used as fumigants in the past but typically with
   diesel injection systems that did not allow the same degree of control
   or mixing enabled by modem common rail systems. In this work we
   experimentally investigated hydrogen, ethanol and gasoline as fumigants
   and examined three levels of fumigant energy fraction (PEP) using
   gasoline over a large direct diesel injection timing range with a single
   cylinder diesel engine. It was found that the operable diesel injection
   timing range at constant FEF was dependent on the fumigant's propensity
   for autoignition. Peak indicated gross cycle efficiency occurred with
   advanced diesel injection timing and aligned well with combustion
   phasing near TDC as we found in an earlier work. The use of hydrogen as
   a fumigant resulted in very low HC emissions compared with ethanol and
   gasoline, establishing that they mainly result from incomplete
   combustion of the fumigated fuel. Hydrogen emissions were independent of
   diesel injection timing and HC emissions were strongly linked to
   combustion phasing, giving further indication that squish and crevice
   flows are responsible for partially burned species from fumigation
   combustion.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced premixed compression ignition (CI) combustion using fumigation
   has been shown to yield significant improvements in indicated efficiency
   over traditional diesel combustion strategies while simultaneously
   reducing engine-out soot and NOx emissions. To better interpret these
   findings, a breakdown of the ways in which actual performance deviates
   from ideal engine cycles is helpful. Non-ideal combustion phasing is one
   cause of such deviations. In this paper, the centroid of the calculated
   apparent heat release rate is used to estimate an adjusted maximum
   possible thermal efficiency based on constant volume combustion using an
   effective compression ratio concept. Using these metrics, experimental
   engine data are evaluated from a single cylinder direct-injection diesel
   engine operating in premixed CI mode enabled by gasoline fumigation and
   a diesel pilot injection. Indicated gross cycle efficiency was found to
   be higher for premixed fumigation compared with a conventional diesel
   condition at the same load. A key finding of the work is that the peak
   indicated cycle efficiency for fumigated premixed CI combustion occurs
   with combustion phased very close to TDC. Shorter heat release duration
   and lower heat losses from the cylinder are thought to be the cause of
   differences in cycle efficiency between conventional combustion and
   premixed CI fumigation modes.}},

Abstract = {{Monocytes/Macrophages have long been recognized as key players in
   inflammation and wound healing and are often employed in vitro to gain
   an understanding of the inflammatory response to biomaterials. Previous
   work has demonstrated a drastic decrease in primary monocyte adherent
   density on biomaterial surfaces coupled with a change in monocyte
   behavior over time. However, the mechanism responsible for this decrease
   remains unclear. In this study, we explored active detachment and
   cellular death as possible regulating factors. Specifically,
   extracellular TNF-alpha and ROS production were analyzed as potential
   endogenous stimulators of cell death. MMPs, but not calpains, were found
   to play a key role in active monocyte detachment. Monocyte death was
   found to peak at 24 h and occur by both apoptosis and necrosis as
   opposed to polymorphonuclear leukocyte death which mainly occurred
   through apoptosis. Finally, TNF-alpha and ROS production were not found
   to have a causal relationship with monocyte death on TCPS or PEG
   surfaces. The occurrence of primary monocyte apoptosis/necrosis as well
   as active detachment from a material surface has implications not only
   in in vitro study, but also in the translation of the in vitro
   inflammatory response of these cells to in vivo applications. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A 9-cm wavelength in the human brain at the 400-MHz Larmor frequency for
   9.4-T leads to pronounced B-1 field contours and consequential image
   inhomogeneity. The objective of this study was to develop a new
   technique to control this nonuniformity by designing the phase and
   magnitude of radiofrequency (RF) power emanating from RF coil antenna
   elements in a multichannel transceiver array. Nonuniformity was used to
   steer a constructively interfering B-1 field node to spatially correlate
   with an anatomic region of interest. This work outlines a convex
   (quadratically constrained quadratic problem) formulation of the B-1
   localization problem and the benefits of such a formulation. This convex
   formulation was used to design antenna excitation magnitude and phase.
   Localization is demonstrated in simulated finite difference time domain

Abstract = {{Disordered regions within proteins have increasingly been associated
   with various cellular functions. Identifying the specific roles played
   by disorder in these functions has proved difficult. However, the
   development of reliable prediction algorithms has expanded the study of
   disorder from a few anecdotal examples to a proteome-wide scale.
   Moreover, the recent omics revolution has provided the sequences of
   numerous organisms as well as thousands of genome-wide data sets
   including several types of interactomes. Here, we review the literature
   regarding genome-wide studies of disorder and examine how these studies
   give rise to new characterizations and categories of this elusive
   phenomenon.}},

Title = {{Influence of Suspending Liquid, Impactor Type, and Substrate on

Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Size-selective sampling methods for detecting viral aerosols are needed
   to assess the risk of airborne transmission of disease. Andersen and
   MOUDI nonviable cascade impactors were used to separate test aerosols
   containing MS2 bacteriophage or adenovirus into size fractions spanning
   much of the human respirable range. Culture-based methods and a
   fluorescent tracer dye allowed quantification of the viral particles
   that remained infective after being aerosolized into a test apparatus
   and collected by the impactors. In addition, various suspension fluids
   and impaction surfaces were evaluated for their effect on virus
   viability. Both the Andersen and MOUDI impactors were able to sample
   live viruses from test aerosols, although the relative recovery rate of
   MS2 was higher than adenovirus (P < 0.001). The MS2 and adenovirus
   aerosols were sensitive to different test factors. MS2 recovery was
   dependent on the suspension fluid (P < 0.0001) and RH (P = 0.001),
   whereas adenovirus recovery was dependent on aerodynamic particle size
   (P < 0.001). Relative recovery of adenovirus was highest in the 0.56-1.9
   mu m diameter range. The results confirm that nonviable cascade
   impactors are capable of size-separating and detecting aerosolized
   viruses in the human respirable range, and that MS2 and adenovirus can
   retain viability after nebulization under experimental conditions. The
   findings cast doubt, however, on the suitability of MS2 as a general
   surrogate for human and animal viruses.}},

Title = {{Modification of Laminar Flow Ultrafine Condensation Particle Counters
   for the Enhanced Detection of 1 nm Condensation Nuclei}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{309-315}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes simple modifications to thermally diffusive laminar
   flow ultrafine condensation particle counters (UCPCs) that allow
   detection of similar to 1 nm condensation nuclei with much higher
   efficiencies than have been previously reported. These non-destructive
   modifications were applied to a commercial butanol-based UCPC (TSI
   3025A) and to a diethylene glycol-based UCPC (UMN DEG-UCPC). Size and
   charge dependent detection efficiencies using the modified UCPCs (BNL
   3025A and BNL DEG-UCPC) were measured with high resolution mobility
   classified aerosols composed of NaCl, W, molecular ion standards of
   tetraalkyl ammonium bromide, and neutralizer-generated ions. With
   negatively charged NaCl aerosol, the BNL 3025A and BNL DEG-UCPC achieved
   detection efficiencies of 37\% (90x increase over TSI 3025A) at 1.68 nm
   mobility diameter (1.39 nm geometric diameter) and 23\% (8x increase
   over UMN DEG-UCPC) at 1.19 nm mobility diameter (0.89 nm geometric
   diameter), respectively. Operating conditions for both UCPCs were
   identified that allowed negatively charged NaCl and W particles, but not
   negative ions of exactly the same mobility size, to be efficiently
   detected. This serendipitous material dependence, which is not
   fundamentally understood, suggests that vapor condensation might
   sometimes allow for the discrimination between air ``ions{''} and
   charged ``particles.{''} As a detector in a scanning mobility particle
   spectrometer (SMPS), a UCPC with this strong material dependence would
   allow for more accurate measurements of sub-2 nm aerosol size
   distributions due to the reduced interference from neutralizer-generated
   ions and atmospheric ions, and provide increased sensitivity for the
   determination of nucleation rates and initial particle growth rates.}},

Title = {{Measurement of Metal Nanoparticle Agglomerates Generated by Spark

Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{333-346}},
Abstract = {{Nanoparticle agglomerates play an essential role in the manufacturing of
   many nanomaterials and are commonly found in combustion products.
   Conventional aerosol instruments based on equivalent spheres are not
   directly applicable to the measurement of nanoparticle agglomerates. The
   increasing interest in real-time assessment of the structure of
   engineered nanoparticle agglomerates and the mass concentration of
   potentially hazardous agglomerates (e. g., diesel soot, welding fume)
   makes an instrument devoted to online structure and mass measurements
   for nanoparticle agglomerates highly desirable. A recently developed
   instrument, universal nanoparticle analyzer (UNPA), utilizes the close
   relation between agglomerate structure and unipolar charging properties
   and infers agglomerate structure from measurement of the average charge
   per agglomerate. It was used in this study to characterize in situ the
   structure of metal nanoparticle agglomerates generated by spark
   discharge, to study the effects of sintering on the structure of these
   agglomerates, and to make real-time assessment of their airborne mass
   concentration. The primary particles sizes measured by UNPA for the gold
   (Au), silver (Ag), and nickel (Ni) agglomerates are in reasonable
   agreement with the TEM (transmission electron microscopy) sizing
   results, d(p) = 7.9 +/- 1.5, 11.8 +/- 3.2, and 6.6 +/- 1.0 nm,
   respectively. In addition, findings from the study of agglomerate
   structural change during sintering using the UNPA sensitivity coincide
   with results from TEM and mobility analyses. With regard to the mass
   concentration of silver agglomerates at room temperature, good agreement
   was found under our experimental conditions between results given by
   UNPA, the effective density, and the gravimetric measurement.}},

   Solutions}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{354-360}},
Abstract = {{It has been difficult to produce physically and chemically pure
   nanoparticles from a particle solution in deionized (DI) water by
   atomization due to residue from impurities in the DI water. In this
   study, we show that further purification of DI water by reverse osmosis
   (RO) membrane filtration under high pressure (900 psi) substantially
   reduces solvent impurities when submicrometer and nanosized particles
   are atomized. Comparison of size distributions among several types of DI
   water showed that the production of residual particles significantly
   decreased by a factor of similar to 11 (by number) after the RO
   filtration of regular DI water from commercially available DI water.
   Mixing states of aerosolized particles produced from particle solutions
   were examined by using the hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility
   analyzer technique and transmission electron microscopy/energy
   dispersive spectroscopy. We found that residual particles were
   externally mixed with particles of interest during the aerosolization
   and drying process and that impurities in DI water can beadded onto the
   target particles (i.e., internally mixed). By removing impurities in DI
   water by the RO filtration, the effect of impurities for the production
   of clean nanoparticles was significantly reduced, suggesting that the
   atomization method can still be a promising tool to produce pure
   nanoparticles in a simple and inexpensive way.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous films comprised of highly c-oriented aluminophosphate AlPO4-5
   or cobalt-substituted AlPO4-5 (CoAPO-5) were grown on porous supports
   and subjected to heat treatment in order to investigate the potential
   for membrane applications. A study in the early stages of in-plane
   crystalline intergrowth revealed a potential mechanism for flake-like
   crystal formation between the original oriented columnar crystals.
   Variations in metal substitution (AlPO4-5, CoAPO-5), support (glass,
   silicon, porous alumina), and calcination method (conventional, rapid
   thermal processing) were chosen to examine the conditions by which
   structural integrity was compromised following secondary (or tertiary)
   growth, resulting in reduced membrane functionality. Through the use of
   rapid thermal processing, the structure debilitation could be partially
   avoided. The membrane quality was inspected through pervaporation
   measurements consisting of a liquid hydrocarbon feed of n-heptane and
   1,3,5-triisopropylbenzene. By investigating the effect of template
   removal on the oriented, columnar crystalline structure, useful insight

Abstract = {{Wide- (WF) and high-frequency (HF) small-signal models are presented for
   pulsewidth-modulated dc-dc buck converter power stage. An exact
   duty-ratio-to-inductor-current transfer function is derived using the WF
   model and compared to an approximate transfer function derived using the
   HF model for the buck converter power stage in continuous conduction
   mode. The theoretical results are validated using experimental results.}},
