Title = {{Effect of extensional viscosity on cocontinuity of immiscible polymer
   blends}},

Abstract = {{Cocontinuous blends were prepared from polyethylene (PE) and polylactic
   acid (PLA). The extensional and shear rheological properties of PE and
   PLA were independently tuned by varying long chain branching
   architecture. Shear rheological properties of the blend components were
   characterized by capillary and oscillatory rheometry. Extensional
   rheological properties were characterized by orifice entrance pressure
   drop and sheet wind-up. It was found that branching significantly
   increased zero-shear viscosity and extensional viscosity, but did not
   alter the shear viscosity at the shear rates typically observed in
   mixing flows. Adding a branched polymer to the blend allowed the other
   blend component to percolate into a continuous network with less
   material. Blending with two branched materials significantly broadened
   the range of cocontinuous compositions from 39-59 vol. \% with a
   linear/linear blend to 25-76 vol. \% for a branched/branched blend. This
   was attributed to the ability of a strain hardening matrix to promote
   elongation, and hence percolation, of the minor phase. Domain size was
   minimized when a slight amount of strain hardening was introduced, as
   this allowed formation of narrow features while stabilizing them against
   fiber breakup. All blends showed a rate of morphological coarsening
   during annealing inversely proportional to zero-shear rate viscosity,
   suggesting that quiescent coarsening flows are dictated by low-rate
   shear flow properties and not extensional properties. We find that our
   results and coarsening rates in the literature show the same linear
   dependence on the ratio of interfacial tension to log volume average
   zero-shear viscosity with a coefficient of similar to 0.03, indicating a
   simple universal relation. (C) 2015 The Society of Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{The performances of heterojunction-based electronic devices are
   extremely sensitive to the interfacial electronic band structure. Here
   we report a largely enhanced performance of photoelectrochemical (PEC)
   photoanodes by ferroelectric polarization-endowed band engineering on
   the basis of TiO2/BaTiO3 core/shell nanowires (NWs). Through a one-step
   hydrothermal process, a uniform, epitaxial, and spontaneously poled
   barium titanate (BTO) layer was created on single crystalline TiO2 NWs.
   Compared to pristine TiO2 NWs, the 5 nm BTO-coated TiO2 NWs achieved
   67\% photocurrent density enhancement. By numerically calculating the
   potential distribution across the TiO2/BTO/electrolyte heterojunction
   and systematically investigating the light absorption, charge injection
   and separation properties of TiO2 and TiO2/BTO NWs, the PEC performance
   gain was proved to be a result of the increased charge separation
   efficiency induced by the ferroelectric polarization of the BTO shell.
   The ferroelectric polarization could be switched by external electric
   field poling and yielded PEC performance gain or loss based on the
   direction of the polarization. This study evidence that the piezotronic
   effect (ferroelectric or piezoelectric potential-induced band structure
   engineering) holds great promises in improving the performance of PEC
   photoelectrodes in addition to chemistry and structure optimization.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades, extensive research on single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs) has elucidated their many extraordinary
   properties(1-3), making them one of the most promising candidates for
   solution-processable, high-performance integrated circuits(4,5). In
   particular, advances in the enrichment of high-purity semiconducting
   SWCNTs6-8 have enabled recent circuit demonstrations including
   synchronous digital logic(9), flexible electronics(10-14) and
   high-frequency applications(15). However, due to the stringent
   requirements of the transistors used in complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) logic as well as the absence of
   sufficiently stable and spatially homogeneous SWCNT thin-film
   transistors(16-18), the development of large-scale SWCNT CMOS integrated
   circuits has been limited in both complexity and functionality(19-21).
   Here, we demonstrate the stable and uniform electronic performance of
   complementary p-type and n-type SWCNT thin-film transistors by
   controlling adsorbed atmospheric dopants and incorporating robust
   encapsulation layers. Based on these complementary SWCNT thin-film
   transistors, we simulate, design and fabricate arrays of low-power
   static random access memory circuits, achieving large-scale integration
   for the first time based on solution-processed semiconductors.}},

Title = {{Functional Effects of a Tissue-Engineered Cardiac Patch From Human

Abstract = {{A tissue-engineered cardiac patch provides a method to deliver
   cardiomyoctes to the injured myocardium with high cell retention and
   large, controlled infarct coverage, enhancing the ability of cells to
   limit remodeling after infarction. The patch environment can also yield
   increased survival. In the present study, we sought to assess the
   efficacy of a cardiac patch made from human induced pluripotent stem
   cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to engraft and limit left
   ventricular (LV) remodeling acutely after infarction. Cardiac patches
   were created from hiPSC-CMs and human pericytes (PCs) entrapped in a
   fibrin gel and implanted acutely onto athymic rat hearts. hiPSC-CMs not
   only remained viable after in vivo culture, but also increased in number
   by as much as twofold, consistent with colocalization of human nuclear
   antigen, cardiac troponin T, and Ki-67 staining. CM+PC patches led to
   reduced infarct sizes compared with myocardial infarction-only controls
   at week 4, and CM+PC patch recipient hearts exhibited greater fractional
   shortening over all groups at both land 4 weeks after transplantation.
   However, a decline occurred in fractional shortening for all groups over
   4 weeks, and LV thinning was not mitigated. CM+PC patches became
   vascularized in vivo, and microvessels were more abundant in the host
   myocardium border zone, suggesting a paracrine mechanism for the
   improved cardiac function. PCs in a PC-only control patch did not
   survive 4 weeks in vivo. Our results indicate that cardiac patches
   containing hiPSC-CMs engraft onto acute infarcts, and the hiPSC-CMs
   survive, proliferate, and contribute to a reduction in infarct size and
   improvements in cardiac function.}},

Abstract = {{The bifunctional wax ester synthase/acyl-coenzyme A:diacylglycerol
   acyltransferase (WS/DGAT or wax ester synthase) catalyzes the terminal
   reaction in the bacterial wax ester biosynthetic pathway, utilizing a
   range of alcohols and fatty acyl-CoAs to synthesize the corresponding
   wax ester. The wild-type wax ester synthase Maqu\_0168 from Marinobacter
   aquaeolei VT8 exhibits a preference for longer fatty alcohols, while
   applications with smaller alcohols would yield products with desired
   biotechnological properties. Small and medium chain length alcohol
   substrates are much poorer substrates for the native enzyme, which may
   hinder broad application of the wax ester synthase in many proposed
   biosynthetic schemes. Developing approaches to improve enzyme activity
   toward specific smaller alcohol substrates first requires a clear
   understanding of which amino acids of the primary sequences of these
   enzymes contribute to substrate specificity in the native enzyme. In
   this report, we surveyed a range of potential residues and identified
   the leucine at position 356 and methionine at position 405 in Maqu\_0168
   as residues that affected selectivity toward small, branched, and
   aromatic alcohols when substituted with different amino acids. This
   analysis provides evidence of residues that line the binding site for
   wax ester synthase, which will aid rational approaches to improve this
   enzyme with specific substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical stresses on the myocyte nucleus have been associated with
   several diseases and potentially transduce mechanical stimuli into
   cellular responses. Although a number of physical links between the
   nuclear envelope and cytoplasmic filaments have been identified,
   previous studies have focused on the mechanical properties of individual
   components of the nucleus, such as the nuclear envelope and lamin
   network. The mechanical interaction between the cytoskeleton and
   chromatin on nuclear deformability remains elusive. Here, we
   investigated how cytoskeletal and chromatin structures influence nuclear
   mechanics in cardiac myocytes. Rapid decondensation of chromatin and
   rupture of the nuclear membrane caused a sudden expansion of DNA, a
   consequence of prestress exerted on the nucleus. To characterize the
   prestress exerted on the nucleus, we measured the shape and the
   stiffness of isolated nuclei and nuclei in living myocytes during
   disruption of cytoskeletal, myofibrillar, and chromatin structure. We
   found that the nucleus in myocytes is subject to both tensional and
   compressional prestress and its deformability is determined by a balance
   of those opposing forces. By developing a computational model of the
   prestressed nucleus, we showed that cytoskeletal and chromatin
   prestresses create vulnerability in the nuclear envelope. Our studies
   suggest the cytoskeletal-nuclear-chromatin interconnectivity may play an
   important role in mechanics of myocyte contraction and in the
   development of laminopathies by lamin mutations.}},

Abstract = {{Although partial migration, a phenomenon in which some individuals in a
   population conduct seasonal migrations while others remain resident, is
   common among animals, its importance in facilitating biological
   invasions has not been demonstrated. To illustrate how partial migration
   might facilitate invasions in spatially complex habitats, we developed
   an individual-based model of common carp Cyprinus carpio in systems of
   lakes and winterkill-prone marshes in the Upper Mississippi River Basin
   (UMRB). Our model predicted that common carp are unable to become
   invasive in lakes of the UMRB unless they conduct partial migrations
   into winterkill-prone marshes in which recruitment rates are high in the
   absence of native predators that forage on carp eggs and larvae. Despite
   low dispersal rates of juveniles and higher mortality rates of migrants,
   partial migration was adaptive across a wide range of migration rates
   and winterkill frequencies. Partial migration rates as low as 10\% and
   winterkill occurrence as infrequent as once in 20 years were sufficient
   to cause invasiveness because of carp's reproductive potential and
   longevity. Consistent with the results of our model, empirical data
   showed that lake connectivity to winterkill-prone marshes was an
   important driver of carp abundance within the study region. Our results
   demonstrate that biological invasions may be driven by a small,
   migratory contingent of a population that exploits more beneficial
   reproductive habitats.}},

Abstract = {{In a locally recoverable or repairable code, any symbol of a codeword
   can be recovered by reading only a small (constant) number of other
   symbols. The notion of local recoverability is important in the area of
   distributed storage where a most frequent error-event is a single
   storage node failure (erasure). A common objective is to repair the node
   by downloading data from as few other storage nodes as possible. In this
   paper, we bound the minimum distance of a code in terms of its length,
   size, and locality. Unlike the previous bounds, our bound follows from a
   significantly simple analysis and depends on the size of the alphabet
   being used. It turns out that the binary Simplex codes satisfy our bound
   with equality; hence, the Simplex codes are the first example of an
   optimal binary locally repairable code family. We also provide
   achievability results based on random coding and concatenated codes that
   are numerically verified to be close to our bounds.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a model of a distributed storage system that
   is locally recoverable from any single server failure. Unlike the usual
   local recovery model of codes for distributed storage, this model
   accounts for the fact that each server or storage node in a network is
   connectable to only some, and not all other, nodes. This may happen for
   reasons such as physical separation, inhomogeneity in storage platforms,
   and so forth. We estimate the storage capacity of both undirected and
   directed networks under this model and propose some constructive
   schemes. From a coding theory point of view, we show that this model is
   approximately dual of the well-studied index coding problem.
   Furthermore, in this paper, we extend the above model to handle multiple
   server failures. Among other results, we provide an upper bound on the
   minimum pairwise distance of a set of words that can be stored in a
   graph with the local repair guarantee. The well-known impossibility
   bounds on the distance of locally recoverable codes follow from our
   result.}},

Abstract = {{Cerebral ischemia sets off a cascade of neuronal and metabolic responses
   to preserve brain viability. An understanding of the temporal evolution
   of these changes during and after ischemia, and their correlation with
   hemodynamic changes, is essential. In this study, a 12-min whole-brain
   ischemia based on the four-blood-vessel occlusion model was employed in
   rats. Using a high-temporal-resolution simultaneous H-1-P-31 MRS
   acquisition sequence at 9.4T, we investigated dynamic occlusion and
   reperfusion responses in cerebral lactate (Lac), phosphocreatine (PCr),
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP), pH, and blood oxygenation level dependence
   (BOLD), together with changes in neuronal field potential activity. We
   reveal tightly coupled dynamics between hemodynamic, metabolic, and
   neuronal responses to ischemia. Neuronal activity, BOLD, PCr, Lac, and
   pH changed immediately following occlusion, indicating reduced energy
   substrates and consumption, and increased glycolysis to maintain
   cellular ATP levels, which started to decrease 2.2min after the onset of
   occlusion. ATP stores were then gradually consumed to maintain a minimum
   housekeeping neuronal activity level. By correlating dynamic changes of
   brain activity, BOLD, and energy metabolism, new insights into the
   brain's survival ability and mechanisms during an acute ischemic attack
   from the perspectives of cerebral metabolism, neuroenergetics, and
   neuronal activity were gained. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{Metallic thin films are widely used and relied upon for various
   technologies. Direct measurements of fracture toughness are rare for
   metallic thin films and existing methods for obtaining these
   measurements often do not provide characterization of the cracking
   process for determination of crack growth mechanisms. To rectify this,
   we explore a new technique which utilizes doubly clamped, in-situ
   three-point bend testing of micro-scale and nano-scale specimens. This
   is done by in-situ scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing for specimens with
   thicknesses of 2500 nm (SEM), 500 nm (SEM) and 100 nm (TEM). For in-situ
   TEM, a novel notching method is employed using the converged electron
   beam which achieves a notch radius of approximately 5 nm. Additionally,
   we present supporting characterization using Electron Backscatter
   Diffraction (EBSD) for 2500 nm thick specimens as a demonstration of the
   potential of this technique for understanding local deformation.
   Analysis of the acquired data presents several issues that require
   addressing, and recommendations for future improvements are given.}},

Abstract = {{In the taxicab industry, a long-standing challenge is how to reduce
   taxicabs' miles spent without fares, i.e., cruising miles. The current
   solutions for this challenge usually depend on passengers to actively
   provide their locations in advance for pickups. To address this
   challenge without the burden on passengers, in this paper, we propose a
   cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to find efficient routes
   to pick up passengers to reduce cruising miles. According to the
   real-time pick-up events from nearby taxicabs, pCruise characterizes a
   cruising process with a cruising graph, and assigns weights on edges of
   the cruising graph to indicate the utility of cruising corresponding
   road segments. Our weighting process considers the number of nearby
   passengers and taxicabs together in real-time, aiming at two scenarios
   where taxicabs are explicitly or implicitly coordinated with each other.
   Based on a weighted cruising graph, when a taxicab becomes vacant,
   pCruise provides a distributed online scheduling strategy to obtain and
   update an efficient cruising route with the minimum length and at least
   one arriving passenger. We evaluate pCruise based on a real-world GPS
   dataset from a Chinese city Shenzhen with 14,000 taxicabs. The
   evaluation results show that pCruise assists taxicab drivers to reduce
   cruising miles by 42 percent on average.}},

Abstract = {{Infiltration rates into field soils have a large variability, and a
   statistical value that represents the overall infiltration in a site is
   needed. The Green-Ampt equation was used to develop a one-dimensional,
   multisoil model to predict the water surface drawdown in an
   infiltration-based stormwater control measure (SCM) as a function of
   time. Results were used to compare the accuracy of assuming the SCM was
   comprised of a single soil with an overall effective saturated hydraulic
   conductivity set equal to (1) the geometric mean of the spatially
   distributed hydraulic conductivity values of the multisoil SCM, (2) the
   arithmetic mean of the hydraulic conductivity values, and (3) a best-fit
   hydraulic conductivity value. Results indicated that the use of the
   geometric mean consistently underestimated infiltration and use of the
   arithmetic mean consistently overestimated infiltration. A relationship
   to more consistently and accurately predict the best-fit value of
   saturated hydraulic conductivity used a weighted sum of 0.32 times the
   arithmetic mean and 0.68 times the geometric mean. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Silicon is one of the most technologically important materials, used
   extensively in electronics, solar cells, micro-electro-mechanical
   systems (MEMS) based devices and more. Yet its mechanical properties are
   not well understood at the nanoscale where it is often utilized.
   Experimental measurements under a variety of loading conditions are
   needed, and compression experiments are particularly lacking. Here, the
   elastic plastic response of 20-65 nm cubic Si nanocubes under uniaxial
   compression is investigated. The purely elastic limit of these nanocubes
   is observed to be up to 0.07 true strain at 7 GPa true stress with an
   upper yield point of 0.20 true strain and 11 GPa true stress.
   Investigation of the nature of dislocations generated during deformation
   of these nanocubes using post-mortem analysis in the TEM provides
   evidence that leading partial dislocations are the dominant source of
   plasticity at this scale. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Heat transfer coefficients in a set of three symmetrically heated narrow
   gap channels arranged in line are reported at power densities of 1
   kW/cm(3) and wall heat flux of 3-40 W/cm(2). This configuration emulates
   an electronics system wherein power dissipation can vary across an array
   of processors, memory chips, or other components. Three pairs of
   parallel ceramic resistance heaters in a nearly adiabatic housing form
   the flow passage, and length-to-gap ratios for each pair of heaters are
   34 at a gap of 0.36 mm. Novec (TM) 7200 and 7300 are used as the heat
   transfer fluids. Nonuniform longitudinal power distributions are
   designed with the center heater pair at 1.5X and 2X the level of the
   first and third heater pairs. At all levels of inlet subcooling,
   single-phase heat transfer dominates over the first two heater pairs,
   while the third pair exhibits significant increases because of the
   presence of flow boiling. Reynolds numbers range from 250 to 1200, Weber
   numbers from 2 to 14, and boiling numbers from O(10(-4)) to O(10(-3)).
   Exit quality can reach 30\% in some cases. Overall heat transfer
   coefficients of 40 kW/m(2) K are obtained. Pressure drops for both Novec
   (TM) heat transfer fluids are approximately equal at a given mass flux,
   and a high ratio of heat transfer to pumping power (coefficient of
   performance (COP)) is obtained. With a mass flux of 250 kg/m(2) s,
   heater temperatures can exceed 95 degrees C, which is the acceptable
   limit of steady operation for contemporary high performance electronics.
   Thus, an optimal operating point involving power density, power
   distribution, mass flux, and inlet subcooling is suggested by the data
   set for this benchmark multiheater configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse models have proven to be extremely successful in image processing
   and computer vision. However, a majority of the effort has been focused
   on sparse representation of vectors and low-rank models for general
   matrices. The success of sparse modeling, along with popularity of
   region covariances, has inspired the development of sparse coding
   approaches for these positive definite descriptors. While in earlier
   work, the dictionary was formed from all, or a random subset of, the
   training signals, it is clearly advantageous to learn a concise
   dictionary from the entire training set. In this paper, we propose a
   novel approach for dictionary learning over positive definite matrices.
   The dictionary is learned by alternating minimization between sparse
   coding and dictionary update stages, and different atom update methods
   are described. A discriminative version of the dictionary learning
   approach is also proposed, which simultaneously learns dictionaries for
   different classes in classification or clustering. Experimental results
   demonstrate the advantage of learning dictionaries from data both from
   reconstruction and classification viewpoints. Finally, a software
   library is presented comprising C++ binaries for all the positive
   definite sparse coding and dictionary learning approaches presented
   here.}},

Abstract = {{The particle filtration efficiency of activated carbons (ACs), which are
   widely used to remove gaseous contaminants by adsorption, was
   investigated experimentally with different kinds of nanoparticles from 3
   to 30 nm. While the chemical composition of nanoparticles did not change
   the filtration efficiency, the face velocity did significantly. The
   single sphere efficiency according to the size of nanoparticles was a
   function of Peclet number (Pe), and the power-law exponent of Pe was
   about -0.5. This value was between those of packed-beds (-2/3) and
   nanofibers (-0.43), which might be caused by the deposition of
   nanoparticles into pores of the ACs through diffusion. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{441-450}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Airborne carbon nanotubes (CNTs) pose a health threat at workplaces and
   play more and more important roles in toxicity studies, yet data and
   model on their detailed characteristics are lacking. Thus we
   investigated aerosolized multiwalled CNTs (MWCNTs) by tandem measurement
   of the mass and mobility size in order to characterize the MWCNT
   agglomerates. The results revealed a fractal-like relationship between
   the mass and mobility size in the range 50-500 nm indicating quite
   compact agglomerate structure, and an effective density in the range of
   0.51-0.83 g/cm(3). With the tube diameters and intrinsic density, the
   tube length in an agglomerate was determined reliably from the mass. We
   developed a model to compute the porosity and geometrical outer diameter
   of the agglomerates and derived the fractal relation between the mass
   and the outer diameter with a fractal dimension of 2.6, which agreed
   well with fractal dimensions of bulk CNT assemblies determined by other
   analytical methods. The effective density based on the outer diameter
   was in the range of 0.11-0.35 g/cm(3) and decreased with the increasing
   agglomerate size. Electron macroscopic images of the aerosolized MWCNTs
   provided comparable data for the outer diameter and fractal dimension.

Abstract = {{Distribution microgrids are being challenged by reverse power flows and
   voltage fluctuations due to renewable generation, demand response, and
   electric vehicles. Advances in photovoltaic (PV) inverters offer new
   opportunities for reactive power management provided PV owners have the
   right investment incentives. In this context, reactive power
   compensation is considered here as an ancillary service. Accounting for
   the increasing time-variability of distributed generation and demand, a
   stochastic reactive power compensation scheme is developed. Given
   uncertain active power injections, an online reactive control scheme is
   devised. This scheme is distribution-free and relies solely on power
   injection data. Reactive injections are updated using the Lagrange
   multipliers of a second-order cone program. Numerical tests on an
   industrial 47-bus microgrid and the residential IEEE 123-bus feeder
   corroborate the reactive power management efficiency of the novel
   stochastic scheme over its deterministic alternative, as well as its
   capability to track variations in solar generation and household demand.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations are used to investigate the vapor-to-liquid nucleation of
   water for several different force fields at various sets of physical
   conditions. The nucleation free energy barrier is found to be extremely
   sensitive to the force field at the same absolute conditions. However,
   when the results are compared at the same supersaturation and reduced
   temperature or the same metastability parameter and reduced temperature,
   then the differences in the nucleation free energies of the different
   models are dramatically reduced. This finding suggests that comparisons
   of experimental data and computational predictions are most meaningful

   the phase diagram of a given computational model, but such information
   is usually not available for models where the interaction energy is

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{APOBEC3G (A3G) protein has antiviral activity against HIV and other
   pathogenic retroviruses. A3G has two domains: a catalytic C-terminal
   domain (CTD) that deaminates cytidine, and a N-terminal domain (NTD)
   that binds to ssDNA. Although abundant information exists about the
   biological activities of A3G protein, the interplay between sequence
   specific deaminase activity and A3G binding to ssDNA remains
   controversial. We used the topographic imaging and force spectroscopy
   modalities of Atomic Force Spectroscopy (AFM) to characterize the
   interaction of A3G protein with deaminase specific and nonspecific ssDNA
   substrates. AFM imaging demonstrated that A3G has elevated affinity for
   deaminase specific ssDNA than for nonspecific ssDNA. AFM force
   spectroscopy revealed two distinct binding modes by which A3G interacts
   with ssDNA. One mode requires sequence specificity, as demonstrated by
   stronger and more stable complexes with deaminase specific ssDNA than
   with nonspecific ssDNA. Overall these observations enforce prior studies
   suggesting that both domains of A3G contribute to the sequence specific
   binding of ssDNA.}},

Abstract = {{We utilize ultrafast time-resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy as a
   direct, sensitive, and non-contact all-optical probe to investigate the
   hot-carrier relaxation and cooling dynamics of buckled epitaxial
   graphene. This special form of graphene is grown epitaxially on
   nitrogen-seeded single-crystal silicon carbide (SiC(000 (1) over bar))
   substrates by thermal decomposition of Si atoms. The pre-deposited
   interfacial nitrogen atoms pin the first graphene layer to the SiC
   substrate, and cause it and subsequent graphene layers to buckle into
   nanoscale folds, which opens an energy gap of up to similar to 0.7 eV.
   We observe a remarkable increase of up to two orders of magnitude in the
   relaxation rate of the THz carrier dynamics of this semiconducting form
   of epitaxial graphene relative to pristine epitaxial graphene, which we
   attribute to a large enhancement of the optical-phonon-mediated carrier
   cooling and recombination over a wide range of electron temperatures due
   to the finite bandgap. Our results suggest that the introduced bandgap
   is spatially non-homogenous, with local values close to the optical
   phonon energy of similar to 200 meV, which allows the conduction and the
   valence band to be bridged by optical phonon emission. We also
   demonstrate that carrier relaxation times can be modified by orders of
   magnitude by careful bandgap engineering, which could find application
   in novel graphene-based devices that incorporate both metallic and
   semiconducting forms of graphene. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Scaling of liquid-drop impact craters in wet granular media}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 26}},
Abstract = {{Combining high-speed photography with laser profilometry, we study the
   dynamics and the morphology of liquid-drop impact cratering in wet
   granular media-a ubiquitous phenomenon relevant to many important
   geological, agricultural, and industrial processes. By systematically
   investigating important variables such as impact energy, the size of
   impinging drops, and the degree of liquid saturation in granular beds,
   we uncover a scaling law for the size of impact craters. We show that
   this scaling can be explained by considering the balance between the
   inertia of impinging drops and the strength of impacted surface. Such a
   theoretical understanding confirms that the unique energy partition
   originally proposed for liquid-drop impact cratering in dry granular
   media also applies for impact cratering in wet granular media. Moreover,
   we demonstrate that compressive stresses, instead of shear stresses,
   control the process of granular impact cratering. Our study enriches the
   picture of generic granular impact cratering and sheds light on the
   familiar phenomena of raindrop impacts in granular media.}},

Abstract = {{Superparamagnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) have been utilized in biomedical
   sensing, detection, therapeutics, and diagnostics due to their unique
   magnetic response under different driving fields. In this letter, we
   report a multi-tracer tracking method that uses different kinds of MNPs
   as magnetic tracers along with two alternating magnetic fields that can
   be potentially used to build magnetic-based flow cytometry. By applying
   two driving fields at frequency f(H) and f(L) to MNPs, the response
   signal is measured at the combinatorial frequencies such as f(H) +/-
   2f(L) (3rd harmonics), f(H) +/- 4f(L) (5th harmonics), f(H) +/- f(L)
   (7th harmonics), and so on. Each MNP has its own signature of phase and
   amplitude, and it is possible to differentiate individual MNPs in a
   mixture. We theoretically demonstrated colorizing up to 4-MNP tracers in
   one mixture with an error rate lower than 10\%. The performance of
   multi-tracer imaging can be optimized by increasing the driving field
   frequency, choosing MNPs with higher saturation magnetization, and using
   MNP tracers with more centralized size distribution. (C) 2015 AIP

Title = {{Nature of the Volume Isotope Effect in Ice}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{The substitution of hydrogen (H) by deuterium (D) in ice Ih and in its
   H-ordered version, ice XI, produces an anomalous form of volume isotope
   effect (VIE), i.e., volume expansion. This VIE contrasts with the normal
   VIE (volume contraction) predicted in ice-VIII and in its H-disordered
   form, ice VII. Here we investigate the VIE in ice XI and in ice VIII
   using first principles quasiharmonic calculations. We conclude that
   normal and anomalous VIEs can be produced in ice VIII and ice XI in
   sequence by application of pressure (ice XI starting at negative
   pressures) followed by a third type-anomalous VIE with zero-point volume
   contraction. The latter should also contribute to the isotope effect in
   the ice VII -> ice X transition. The predicted change between normal and
   anomalous VIE in ice VIII at 14.3 GPa and 300 K is well reproduced
   experimentally in ice VII using x-ray diffraction measurements. The
   present discussion of the VIE is general, and conclusions should be
   applicable to other solid phases of H2O, possibly to liquid water under
   pressure, and to other H-bonded materials.}},

Abstract = {{A 3D printing methodology for the design, optimization, and fabrication
   of a custom nerve repair technology for the regeneration of complex
   peripheral nerve injuries containing bifurcating sensory and motor nerve
   pathways is introduced. The custom scaffolds are deterministically
   fabricated via a microextrusion printing principle using 3D models,
   which are reverse engineered from patient anatomies by 3D scanning. The
   bifurcating pathways are augmented with 3D printed biomimetic physical
   cues (microgrooves) and path-specific biochemical cues (spatially
   controlled multicomponent gradients). In vitro studies reveal that 3D
   printed physical and biochemical cues provide axonal guidance and
   chemotractant/chemokinetic functionality. In vivo studies examining the
   regeneration of bifurcated injuries across a 10 mm complex nerve gap in
   rats showed that the 3D printed scaffolds achieved successful
   regeneration of complex nerve injuries, resulting in enhanced functional
   return of the regenerated nerve. This approach suggests the potential of
   3D printing toward advancing tissue regeneration in terms of: (1) the
   customization of scaffold geometries to match inherent tissue anatomies;
   (2) the integration of biomanufacturing approaches with computational
   modeling for design, analysis, and optimization; and (3) the enhancement
   of device properties with spatially controlled physical and biochemical
   functionalities, all enabled by the same 3D printing process.}},

Title = {{A novel channel selection method for optimal classification in different
   motor imagery BCI paradigms}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING ONLINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{Background: For sensorimotor rhythms based brain-computer interface
   (BCI) systems, classification of different motor imageries (MIs) remains
   a crucial problem. An important aspect is how many scalp electrodes
   (channels) should be used in order to reach optimal performance
   classifying motor imaginations. While the previous researches on channel
   selection mainly focus on MI tasks paradigms without feedback, the
   present work aims to investigate the optimal channel selection in MI
   tasks paradigms with real-time feedback (two-class control and
   four-class control paradigms).
   Methods: In the present study, three datasets respectively recorded from
   MI tasks experiment, two-class control and four-class control
   experiments were analyzed offline. Multiple frequency-spatial
   synthesized features were comprehensively extracted from every channel,
   and a new enhanced method IterRelCen was proposed to perform channel
   selection. IterRelCen was constructed based on Relief algorithm, but was
   enhanced from two aspects: change of target sample selection strategy
   and adoption of the idea of iterative computation, and thus performed
   more robust in feature selection. Finally, a multiclass support vector
   machine was applied as the classifier. The least number of channels that
   yield the best classification accuracy were considered as the optimal
   channels. One-way ANOVA was employed to test the significance of
   performance improvement among using optimal channels, all the channels
   and three typical MI channels (C3, C4, Cz).
   Results: The results show that the proposed method outperformed other
   channel selection methods by achieving average classification accuracies
   of 85.2, 94.1, and 83.2 \% for the three datasets, respectively.
   Moreover, the channel selection results reveal that the average numbers
   of optimal channels were significantly different among the three MI
   paradigms.
   Conclusions: It is demonstrated that IterRelCen has a strong ability for
   feature selection. In addition, the results have shown that the numbers
   of optimal channels in the three different motor imagery BCI paradigms
   are distinct. From a MI task paradigm, to a two-class control paradigm,
   and to a four-class control paradigm, the number of required channels
   for optimizing the classification accuracy increased. These findings may
   provide useful information to optimize EEG based BCI systems, and
   further improve the performance of noninvasive BCI.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal effects in optical substrates are vitally important in
   determining laser damage resistance in long-pulse and continuous-wave
   laser systems. Thermal deformation waves in a soda-lime-silica glass
   substrate have been measured using high-speed interferometry during a
   series of laser pulses incident on the surface. Two-dimensional images
   of the thermal waves were captured at a rate of up to six frames per
   thermal event using a quantitative phase measurement method. The system
   comprised a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, along with a high-speed camera
   capable of up to 20,000 frames-per-second. The sample was placed in the
   interferometer and irradiated with 100 ns, 2 kHz Q-switched pulses from
   a high-power Nd:YAG laser operating at 1064 nm. Phase measurements were
   converted to temperature using known values of thermal expansion and
   temperature-dependent refractive index for glass. The thermal decay at
   the center of the thermal wave was fit to a function derived from first
   principles with excellent agreement. Additionally, the spread of the
   thermal distribution over time was fit to the same function. Both the
   temporal decay fit and the spatial fit produced a thermal diffusivity of
   5 x 10(-7) m(2)/s. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{We report electrical measurements of the current-induced spin
   polarization of the surface current in topological insulator devices
   where contributions from bulk and surface conduction can be disentangled
   by electrical gating. The devices use a ferromagnetic tunnel junction
   (permalloy/Al2O3) as a spin detector on a back-gated (Bi, Sb)(2)Te-3
   channel. We observe hysteretic voltage signals as the magnetization of
   the detector ferromagnet is switched parallel or antiparallel to the
   spin polarization of the surface current. The amplitude of the detected
   voltage change is linearly proportional to the applied dc bias current
   in the (Bi, Sb)(2)Te-3 channel. As the chemical potential is tuned from
   the bulk bands into the surface state band, we observe an enhancement of
   the spin-dependent voltages up to 300\% within the range of the
   electrostatic gating. Using a simple model, we extract the spin
   polarization near charge neutrality (i.e., the Dirac point).}},

Abstract = {{Among all the 3D optical flow diagnostic techniques, digital inline
   holographic particle tracking velocimetry (DIH-PTV) provides the highest
   spatial resolution with low cost, simple and compact optical setups.
   Despite these advantages, DIH-PTV suffers from major limitations
   including poor longitudinal resolution, human intervention (i.e.
   requirement for manually determined tuning parameters during tracer
   field reconstruction and extraction), limited tracer concentration, and
   expensive computations. These limitations prevent this technique from
   being widely used for high resolution 3D flow measurements. In this
   study, we present a novel holographic particle extraction method with
   the goal of overcoming all the major limitations of DIH-PTV. The
   proposed method consists of multiple steps involving 3D deconvolution,
   automatic signal-to-noise ratio enhancement and thresholding, and
   inverse iterative particle extraction. The entire method is implemented
   using GPU-based algorithm to increase the computational speed
   significantly. Validated with synthetic particle holograms, the proposed
   method can achieve particle extraction rate above 95\% with fake
   particles less than 3\% and maximum position error below 1.6 particle
   diameter for holograms with particle concentration above 3000
   particles/mm(3). The applicability of the proposed method for DIH-PTV
   has been further validated using the experiment of laminar flow in a
   microchannel and the synthetic tracer flow fields generated using a DNS
   turbulent channel flow database. Such improvements will substantially
   enhance the implementation of DIH-PTV for 3D flow measurements and
   enable the potential commercialization of this technique. (C) 2015

Title = {{Multiparametric MRI of Epiphyseal Cartilage Necrosis (Osteochondrosis)
   with Histological Validation in a Goat Model}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Purpose
   To evaluate multiple MRI parameters in a surgical model of
   osteochondrosis (OC) in goats.
   Methods
   Focal ischemic lesions of two different sizes were induced in the
   epiphyseal cartilage of the medial femoral condyles of goats at 4 days
   of age by surgical transection of cartilage canal blood vessels. Goats
   were euthanized and specimens harvested 3, 4, 5, 6, 9 and 10 weeks
   post-op. Ex vivo MRI scans were conducted at 9.4 Tesla for mapping the
   T-1, T-2, T-1 rho, adiabatic T-1 rho and T-RAFF relaxation times of
   articular cartilage, unaffected epiphyseal cartilage, and epiphyseal
   cartilage within the area of the induced lesion. After MRI scans,
   safranin O staining was conducted to validate areas of ischemic necrosis
   induced in the medial femoral condyles of six goats, and to allow
   comparison of MRI findings with the semi-quantitative proteoglycan
   assessment in corresponding safranin O-stained histological sections.
   Results
   All relaxation time constants differentiated normal epiphyseal cartilage
   from lesions of ischemic cartilage necrosis, and the histological
   staining results confirmed the proteoglycan (PG) loss in the areas of
   ischemia. In the scanned specimens, all of the measured relaxation time
   constants were higher in the articular than in the normal epiphyseal
   cartilage, consistently allowing differentiation between these two
   tissues.
   Conclusions
   Multiparametric MRI provided a sensitive approach to discriminate
   between necrotic and viable epiphyseal cartilage and between articular
   and epiphyseal cartilage, which may be useful for diagnosing and
   monitoring OC lesions and, potentially, for assessing effectiveness of
   treatment interventions.}},

Abstract = {{One-dimensional (1-D) and two-dimensional (2-D) frequency estimation for
   a single complex sinusoid in white Gaussian noise is a classic signal
   processing problem with numerous applications. It is revisited here
   through a new unitary principal-singular-vector utilization modal
   analysis (PUMA) approach, which is realized in terms of real-valued
   computations. The 2-D unitary PUMA is first formulated as an iteratively
   weighted least squares optimization problem. Recognizing that only one
   iteration is sufficient when 2-D unitary PUMA is initialized using least
   squares, a computationally attractive closed-form solution is then
   obtained. A variant of 2-D unitary PUMA is also developed for the 1-D
   case. Due to the real-valued computations and closed-form expression for
   the frequency estimate, the unitary PUMA is more computationally
   efficient than a number of state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the
   asymptotic variances of 1-D and 2-D unitary PUMA estimators are
   theoretically derived, and numerical results are included to demonstrate
   the effectiveness of the proposed methods.}},

Abstract = {{Tensor factorization has proven useful in a wide range of applications,
   from sensor array processing to communications, speech and audio signal
   processing, and machine learning. With few recent exceptions, all tensor
   factorization algorithms were originally developed for centralized,
   in-memory computation on a single machine; and the few that break away
   from this mold do not easily incorporate practically important
   constraints, such as non-negativity. A new constrained tensor
   factorization framework is proposed in this paper, building upon the
   Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMoM). It is shown that
   this simplifies computations, bypassing the need to solve constrained
   optimization problems in each iteration; and it naturally leads to
   distributed algorithms suitable for parallel implementation. This opens
   the door for many emerging big data-enabled applications. The
   methodology is exemplified using non-negativity as a baseline
   constraint, but the proposed framework can incorporate many other types
   of constraints. Numerical experiments are encouraging, indicating that
   ADMoM-based non-negative tensor factorization (NTF) has high potential
   as an alternative to state-of-the-art approaches.}},

Month = {{OCT 15}},
Abstract = {{Fourier's law leads to a diffusive model of heat transfer in which a
   thermal signal propagates infinitely fast and the only material
   parameter is the thermal conductivity. In micro- and nano-scale systems,
   non-Fourier effects involving coupled diffusion and wavelike propagation
   of heat can become important. An extension of Fourier's law to account
   for such effects leads to a Jeffreys-type model for heat transfer with
   two relaxation times. We propose a new Thermal Parameter Identification
   (TPI) method for obtaining the Jeffreys-type thermal parameters from
   molecular dynamics simulations. The TPI method makes use of a nonlinear
   regression-based approach for obtaining the coefficients in analytical
   expressions for cosine and sine-weighted averages of temperature and
   heat flux over the length of the system. The method is applied to argon
   nanobeams over a range of temperature and system sizes. The results for
   thermal conductivity are found to be in good agreement with standard
   Green-Kubo and direct method calculations. The TPI method is more
   efficient for systems with high diffusivity and has the advantage, that
   unlike the direct method, it is free from the influence of thermostats.
   In addition, the method provides the thermal relaxation times for argon.
   Using the determined parameters, the Jeffreys-type model is able to
   reproduce the molecular dynamics results for a short-duration heat pulse
   where wavelike propagation of heat is observed thereby confirming the
   existence of second sound in argon. An implementation of the TPI method
   in MATLAB is available as part of the online supplementary material. (C)

Title = {{Towards intrinsic graphene biosensor: A label-free, suspended single

Abstract = {{Graphene biosensors reported so far are based on polycrystalline
   graphene flakes which are anchored on supporting substrates. The
   influence of grain boundary and the scattering from substrate
   drastically degrade the properties of graphene and conceal the
   performance of intrinsic graphene as a sensor. Here we report a
   label-free biosensor based on suspended single crystalline graphene
   (SCG), which can get rid of grain boundary and substrate scattering,
   revealing the biosensing mechanism of intrinsic graphene for the first
   time. Monolayer SCG flakes were derived from low pressure chemical vapor
   deposition (LPCVD) method. Multiplex detection of three different lung
   cancer tumor markers was realized. The suspended structure can largely
   improve the sensitivity and detection limit (0.1 pg/ml) of the sensor,
   and the single crystalline nature of SCG enable the biosensor to have
   superior uniformity compared to polycrystalline ones. The SCG sensors
   exhibit superb specificity and large linear detection range from 1 pg/ml
   to 1 mu g/ml, showing the prominent advantages of graphene as a sensing
   material. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The weight-average molecular weight M-w, z-average radius of gyration
   R-g, and second virial coefficient A(2) have been determined between 15
   and 52 degrees C for dilute aqueous solutions of methylcellulose (MC)
   with three different molecular weights and constant degree of
   substitution (DS) of 1.8 using static light scattering. These
   measurements, conducted within 1 h of heating the homogeneous solutions
   from 5 degrees C, reveal that the theta temperature for MC in water is
   T-0 = 48 +/- 2 degrees C, with A(2) < 0 for T > T-theta, indicative of
   lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior. However, after
   annealing a solution for 2 days at 40 degrees C evidence of high
   molecular weight aggregates appears through massive increases in the
   apparent M-w and R-g, a process that continues to evolve for at least 12
   days. Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy images obtained from a
   solution aged for 3 weeks at 40 degrees C reveal the presence of micron
   size fibrils with a diameter of 16 +/- 4 nm, structurally analogous to
   the fibrils that form upon gelation of aqueous MC solutions at higher
   concentrations and elevated temperatures. Growth of fibrils from a
   solution characterized by a positive A(2) indicates that semiflexible MC
   dissolved in water is metastable at T < T-theta, even though the solvent
   quality is apparently good. The minimum temperature required for MC
   solutions to aggregate is estimated to be 30 degrees C, based on the
   rate-independent gel-to-solution transition determined by
   small-amplitude oscillatory shear measurements conducted while cooling
   0.5 and 5.0 wt \% solutions. These results cannot be explained based
   solely on separation into two isotropic phases upon heating using
   classical Flory-Huggins solution theory. We speculate that the
   underlying equilibrium phase behavior of aqueous MC solutions involves a
   nematic order parameter.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoelectric materials have great potential to revolutionize
   electronic devices due to the coupling of their electric and magnetic
   properties. Thickness varying La0.7Sr0.3MnO3
   (LSMO)/PbZro(0.2)Ti(0.8)O(3) (PZT) heterostructures were built and
   measured in this article by valence sensitive x-ray absorption
   spectroscopy. The sizing effects of the heterostructures on the LSMO/PZT
   magnetoelectric interfaces were investigated through the behavior of Mn
   valence, a property associated with the LSMO magnetization. We found
   that Mn valence increases with both LSMO and PZT thickness.
   Piezoresponse force microscopy revealed a transition from monodomain to
   polydotnain structure along the PZT thickness gradient. The
   ferroelectric surface charge may change with domain structure and its
   effects on Mn valence were simulated using a two-orbital double-exchange
   model. The screening of ferroelectric surface charge increases the
   electron charges in the interface region, and greatly changes the
   interfacial Mn valence, which likely plays a leading role in the
   intetfacial magnetoelectric coupling. The LSMO thickness dependence was
   examined through the combination of two detection modes with drastically
   different attenuation depths. The different length scales of these
   techniques' sensitivity to the atomic valence were used to estimate the
   depth dependence Mn valence. A smaller interfacial Mn valence than the
   bulk was found by globally fitting the experimental results. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A new method for generating metal clusters in the gas phase is described
   and characterized in this work. The method is based on material
   evaporation by spark ablation at atmospheric pressure. The
   characterization of atomic clusters was done by measuring their
   electrical mobility. The measured mobilities were compared with values
   found in literature in order to identify the cluster species. We show
   that silver clusters consisting from one up to 25 atoms can be produced
   in helium at atmospheric pressure. In addition, the effect of oxygen
   concentration on the resulting cluster mobility distribution was
   investigated. Results show that at higher oxygen level, the mobility
   distribution is dominated by the abundance of stable clusters (i.e.,
   magic number clusters). This can be attributed to an oxidation etching
   effect.

Abstract = {{Spray-dried dispersions (SDDs) are fascinating polymer-drug mixtures
   that exploit the amorphous state of a drug to dramatically elevate its
   apparent aqueous solubility above equilibrium. For practical usage in
   oral delivery, understanding how polymers mechanistically provide
   physical stability during storage and prevent supersaturated drugs from
   succumbing to precipitation during dissolution remains a formidable
   challenge. To this end, we developed a versatile polymeric platform with
   functional groups analogous to hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate
   succinate (HPMCAS, a heterogeneous leading excipient candidate for SDDs)
   and studied its interactions with Biopharmaceutical Classification
   System Class II drug models probucol, danazol, and phenytoin at various
   dosages. By conducting reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer
   polymerizations with monomeric components chemically analogous to
   HPMCAS, we synthetically dismantled the highly polydisperse architecture
   of HPMCAS into well-defined polymer systems (i.e., targetable M-n, D <
   1.3, tunable T-g). In the powdered SDD form, by wide-angle X-ray
   diffraction all HPMCAS analogs yielded amorphous danazol and phenytoin
   up to 50 wt \% loading, whereas for probucol, hydrophobic methoxy
   functionality and high polymeric Tg were key to inhibit immediate
   partitioning into crystalline domains. Nonsink in vitro dissolution
   tests revealed distinct release profiles. The polymer containing only
   acetyl and succinoyl substituents spray-dried with probucol increased
   the area under the dissolution curve by a factor of 180, 112, and 26
   over pure drug at 10, 25, and 50 wt \% loading, respectively. For
   crystallization-prone danazol and phenytoin, we observed that the
   water-soluble polymer with hydroxyl groups inhibited crystal growth and
   enabled high burst release and supersaturation maintenance. Our findings
   provide fundamental insight into how excipient microstructures can
   complex with drugs for excipient formulation applications.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Exposure to air pollution has been consistently associated
   with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, but mechanisms remain
   uncertain. Associations with blood pressure (BP) may help to explain the
   cardiovascular effects of air pollution.
   Objective: We examined the cross-sectional relationship between
   long-term (annual average) residential air pollution exposure and BP in
   the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences' Sister Study, a
   large U.S. cohort study investigating risk factors for breast cancer and
   other outcomes.
   Methods: This analysis included 43,629 women 35-76 years of age,
   enrolled 2003-2009, who had a sister with breast cancer. Geographic
   information systems contributed to satellite-based nitrogen dioxide
   (NO2) and fine particulate matter (<= 2.5 mu m; PM2.5) predictions at
   participant residences at study entry. Generalized additive models were
   used to examine the relationship between pollutants and measured BP at
   study entry, adjusting for cardiovascular disease risk factors and
   including thin plate splines for potential spatial confounding.
   Results: A 10-mu g/m(3) increase in PM2.5 was associated with 1.4-mmHg
   higher systolic BP (95\% CI: 0.6, 2.3; p < 0.001), 1.0-mmHg higher pulse
   pressure (95\% CI: 0.4, 1.7; p = 0.001), 0.8-mmHg higher mean arterial
   pressure (95\% CI: 0.2, 1.4; p = 0.01), and no significant association
   with diastolic BP. A 10-ppb increase in NO2 was associated with a
   0.4-mmHg (95\% yCI: 0.2, 0.6; p < 0.001) higher pulse pressure.
   Conclusions: Long-term PM2.5 and NO2 exposures were associated with
   higher blood pressure. On a population scale, such air pollution-related
   increases in blood pressure could, in part, account for the increases in
   cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality seen in prior studies.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used nonionizing and
   noninvasive diagnostic instrument to produce detailed images of the
   human body. The radio-frequency (RF) coil is an essential part of MRI
   hardware as an RF front-end. RF coils transmit RF energy to the subject
   and receive the returning MR signal. This paper presents an
   MRI-compatible hardware design of the new automatic frequency tuning and
   impedance matching system. The system automatically corrects the detuned
   and mismatched condition that occurs due to loading effects caused by
   the variable subjects (i.e., different human heads or torsos). An
   eight-channel RF transceiver head coil with the automatic system has
   been fabricated and tested at 7 Tesla (T) MRI system. The automatic
   frequency tuning and impedance matching system uses digitally controlled
   capacitor arrays with real-time feedback control capability. The
   hardware design is not only compatible with current MRI scanners in all
   aspects but also it operates the tuning and matching function rapidly
   and accurately. The experimental results show that the automatic
   function increases return losses from 8.4 dB to 23.7 dB (maximum
   difference) and from 12.7 dB to 19.6 dB (minimum difference) among eight
   channels within 550 ms. The reflected RF power decrease from 23.1\% to
   1.5\% (maximum difference) and from 5.3\% to 1.1\% (minimum difference).
   Therefore, these results improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in MR
   images with phantoms.}},

Title = {{Interpolation effects in tabulated interatomic potentials}},
Journal = {{MODELLING AND SIMULATION IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Empirical interatomic potentials are widely used in atomistic
   simulations due to their ability to compute the total energy and
   interatomic forces quickly relative to more accurate quantum
   calculations. The functional forms in these potentials are sometimes
   stored in a tabulated format, as a collection of data points
   (argument-value pairs), and a suitable interpolation (often
   spline-based) is used to obtain the function value at an arbitrary
   point. We explore the effect of these interpolations on the potential
   predictions by calculating the quasi-harmonic thermal expansion and
   finite-temperature elastic constant of a one-dimensional chain compared
   with molecular dynamics simulations. Our results show that some
   predictions are affected by the choice of interpolation regardless of
   the number of tabulated data points. Our results clearly indicate that
   the interpolation must be considered part of the potential definition,
   especially for lattice dynamics properties that depend on higher-order
   derivatives of the potential. This is facilitated by the Knowledgebase
   of Interatomic Models (KIM) project, in which both the tabulated data
   ('parameterized model') and the code that interpolates them to compute
   energy and forces ('model driver') are stored and given unique citeable
   identifiers. We have developed cubic and quintic spline model drivers
   for pair functional type models (EAM, FS, EMT) and uploaded them to the
   OpenKIM repository (https://openkim.org).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider solving multiple-block separable convex
   minimization problems using alternating direction method of multipliers
   (ADMM). Motivated by the fact that the existing convergence theory for
   ADMM is mostly limited to the two-block case, we analyze in this paper,
   both theoretically and numerically, a new strategy that first transforms
   a multi-block problem into an equivalent two-block problem (either in
   the primal domain or in the dual domain) and then solves it using the
   standard two-block ADMM. In particular, we derive convergence results
   for this two-block ADMM approach to solve multi-block separable convex
   minimization problems, including an improved O(1/is an element of)
   iteration complexity result. Moreover, we compare the numerical
   efficiency of this approach with the standard multi-block ADMM on
   several separable convex minimization problems which include basis
   pursuit, robust principal component analysis and latent variable
   Gaussian graphical model selection. The numerical results show that the
   multiple-block ADMM, although lacks theoretical convergence guarantees,
   typically outperforms two-block ADMMs.}},

Abstract = {{The relative ease, speed, and biological scope of clustered regularly
   interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated
   Protein9 (Cas9)-based reagents for genomic manipulations are
   revolutionizing virtually all areas of molecular biosciences, including
   functional genomics, genetics, applied biomedical research, and
   agricultural biotechnology. In plant systems, however, a number of
   hurdles currently exist that limit this technology from reaching its
   full potential. For example, significant plant molecular biology
   expertise and effort is still required to generate functional expression
   constructs that allow simultaneous editing, and especially
   transcriptional regulation, of multiple different genomic loci or
   multiplexing, which is a significant advantage of CRISPR/Cas9 versus
   other genome-editing systems. To streamline and facilitate rapid and
   wide-scale use of CRISPR/Cas9-based technologies for plant research, we
   developed and implemented a comprehensive molecular toolbox for
   multifaceted CRISPR/Cas9 applications in plants. This toolbox provides
   researchers with a protocol and reagents to quickly and efficiently
   assemble functional CRISPR/Cas9 transfer DNA constructs for monocots and
   dicots using Golden Gate and Gateway cloning methods. It comes with a
   full suite of capabilities, including multiplexed gene editing and
   transcriptional activation or repression of plant endogenous genes. We
   report the functionality and effectiveness of this toolbox in model
   plants such as tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana), Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis
   thaliana), and rice (Oryza sativa), demonstrating its utility for basic

Abstract = {{This paper examines the impact of location and load shape selection on
   microgrid optimal design. 96 unique combinations of location and load
   shape are considered to provide a broader scope than any previous work
   in microgrid design sensitivity analysis. In addition, the level of
   autonomy from the macrogrid is considered as a tunable parameter in the
   optimization. A generic system is considered consisting of
   photovoltaics, wind turbine, microturbines, electric and natural gas
   boilers, thermal storage, and a battery bank. The microgrid is
   grid-connected and designed to supply both heat and power. A mixed
   integer linear program is used to minimize the expected cost of energy
   supply over a 20 year horizon. Trends in the design results are
   discussed and important input parameters that depend on the location and
   load shape are identified. Finally, a procedure to quantify these trends
   and predict optimal design results in new locations is proposed. (C)

   Multibit Decision}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes, as the first provable capacity-achieving error-correcting
   codes, have received much attention in recent years. However, the
   decoding performance of polar codes with traditional
   successive-cancellation (SC) algorithm cannot match that of the
   low-density parity-check or Turbo codes. Because SC list (SCL) decoding
   algorithm can significantly improve the error-correcting performance of
   polar codes, design of SCL decoders is important for polar codes to be
   deployed in practical applications. However, because the prior latency
   reduction approaches for SC decoders are not applicable for SCL
   decoders, these list decoders suffer from the long-latency bottleneck.
   In this paper, we propose a multibit-decision approach that can
   significantly reduce latency of SCL decoders. First, we present a
   reformulated SCL algorithm that can perform intermediate decoding of 2 b
   together. The proposed approach, referred as 2-bit reformulated SCL
   (2b-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the latency of SCL decoder from (3n - 2)
   to (2n - 2) clock cycles without any performance loss. Then, we extend
   the idea of 2-b-decision to general case, and propose a general decoding
   scheme that can perform intermediate decoding of any 2(K) bits
   simultaneously. This general approach, referred as 2(K) -bit
   reformulated SCL (2(K) b-rSCL) algorithm, can reduce the overall
   decoding latency to as short as n/2(K-2) - 2 cycles. Furthermore, on the
   basis of the proposed algorithms, very large-scale integration
   architectures for 2b-rSCL and 4b-rSCL decoders are synthesized. Compared
   with a prior SCL decoder, the proposed (1024, 512) 2b-rSCL and 4b-rSCL
   decoders can achieve 21\% and 60\% reduction in latency, 1.66 and 2.77
   times increase in coded throughput with list size 2, and 2.11 and 3.23
   times increase in coded throughput with list size 4, respectively.}},

Title = {{Leveraging Transactional Execution for Memory Consistency Model
   Emulation}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{System emulation is widely used in today's computer systems. This
   technology opens new opportunities for resource sharing as well as
   enhancing system security and reliability. System emulation across
   different instruction set architectures (ISA) can enable further
   opportunities. For example, cross-ISA emulation can enable workload
   consolidation over a wide range of microprocessors and potentially
   facilitate the seamless deployment of new processor architectures. As
   multicore and manycore processors become pervasive, it is important to
   address the challenges toward supporting system emulation on these
   platforms. A key challenge in cross-ISA emulation on multicore systems
   is ensuring the correctness of emulation when the guest and the host
   memory consistency models differ. Many existing cross-ISA system
   emulators are sequential, thus they are able to avoid this problem at
   the cost of significant performance degradation. Recently proposed
   parallel emulators are able to address the performance limitation;
   however, they provide limited support for memory consistency model
   emulation.
   When the host system has a weaker memory consistency model compared to
   the guest system, the emulator can insert memory fences at appropriate
   locations in the translated code to enforce the guest memory ordering
   constraints. These memory fences can significantly degrade the
   performance of the translated code. Transactional execution support
   available on certain recent microprocessors provides an alternative
   approach. Transactional execution of the translated code enforces
   sequential consistency (SC) at the coarse-grained transaction level,
   which in turn ensures that all memory accesses made on the host machine
   conform to SC. Enforcing SC on the host machine guarantees that the
   emulated execution will be correct for any guest memory model. In this
   article, we compare and evaluate the overheads associated with using
   transactions and fences for memory consistency model emulation on the
   Intel Haswell processor. Our experience of implementing these two
   approaches on a state-of-the-art parallel emulator, COREMU, demonstrates
   that memory consistency model emulation using transactions performs
   better when the transaction sizes are large enough to amortize the
   transaction overhead and the transaction conflict rate is low, whereas
   inserting memory fences is better for applications in which the
   transaction overhead is high. A hybrid implementation that dynamically
   determines which approach to invoke can outperform both approaches. Our
   results, based on the SPLASH-2 and the PARSEC benchmark suites,
   demonstrate that the proposed hybrid approach is able to outperform the
   fence insertion mechanism by 4.9\% and the transactional execution
   approach by 24.9\% for two-thread applications, and outperform them by
   4.5\% and 44.7\%, respectively, for four-threaded execution.}},

Title = {{On Optimizing Airline Ticket Purchase Timing}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Proper timing of the purchase of airline tickets is difficult even when
   historical ticket prices and some domain knowledge are available. To
   address this problem, we introduce an algorithm that optimizes purchase
   timing on behalf of customers and provides performance estimates of its
   computed action policy. Given a desired flight route and travel date,
   the algorithm uses machine-learning methods on recent ticket price
   quotes from many competing airlines to predict the future expected
   minimum price of all available flights. The main novelty of our
   algorithm lies in using a systematic feature-selection technique, which
   captures time dependencies in the data by using time-delayed features,
   and reduces the number of features by imposing a class hierarchy among
   the raw features and pruning the features based on in-situ performance.
   Our algorithm achieves much closer to the optimal purchase policy than
   other existing decision theoretic approaches for this domain, and meets
   or exceeds the performance of existing feature-selection methods from
   the literature. Applications of our feature-selection process to other
   domains are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Di- and trichloroisocyanuric acids are widely used as water disinfection
   agents, but cyanuric acid accumulates with repeated additions and must
   be removed to maintain free hypochlorite for disinfection. This study
   describes the development of methods for using a cyanuric acid-degrading
   enzyme contained within nonliving cells that were encapsulated within a
   porous silica matrix. Initially, three different bacterial cyanuric acid
   hydrolases were compared: TrzD from Acidovorax citrulli strain 12227,
   AtzD from Pseudomonas sp. strain ADP, and CAH from Moorella
   thermoacetica ATCC 39073. Each enzyme was expressed recombinantly in
   Escherichia coli and tested for cyanuric acid hydrolase activity using
   freely suspended or encapsulated cell formats. Cyanuric acid hydrolase
   activities differed by only a 2-fold range when comparing across the
   different enzymes with a given format. A practical water filtration
   system is most likely to be used with nonviable cells, and all cells
   were rendered nonviable by heat treatment at 70 degrees C for 1 h. Only
   the CAH enzyme from the thermophile M. thermoacetica retained
   significant activity under those conditions, and so it was tested in a
   flowthrough system simulating a bioreactive pool filter. Starting with a
   cyanuric acid concentration of 10,000 mu M, more than 70\% of the
   cyanuric acid was degraded in 24 h, it was completely removed in 72 h,
   and a respike of 10,000 mu M cyanuric acid a week later showed identical
   biodegradation kinetics. An experiment conducted with water obtained
   from municipal swimming pools showed the efficacy of the process,
   although cyanuric acid degradation rates decreased by 50\% in the
   presence of 4.5 ppm hypochlorite. In total, these experiments
   demonstrated significant robustness of cyanuric acid hydrolase and the
   silica bead materials in remediation.}},

Abstract = {{A wideband signal sensor is an essential component to enable cognitive
   radio and dynamic spectrum access techniques, providing real-time
   detection and modulation classification in a wideband environment of
   interest. The problem is challenging, requiring a processing suite
   incorporating detection, estimation, and classification, with stringent
   power objectives to enable widespread use in untethered battery powered
   devices. This article provides an overview of an integrated
   system-on-chip extremely low-power solution, including a wideband
   mixed-signal front-end, an algorithm suite that incorporates a blind
   hierarchical modulation classifier, and an ASIC implementation that
   employs dynamic voltage-frequency scaling and parallel processing that
   achieves measured energy efficiency ranging between 11.9 GOPS/mW and
   13.6 GOPS/mW for full channel feature extraction, resulting in power
   consumption of 20.1 similar to 22.6 mW depending on the number of
   signals and signal bandwidth. The system bandwidth is selectable at 5,
   50, and 500 MHz; in the 500 MHz case an efficient analog 8-point FFT
   channelizer relaxes the A/D requirement. The sensor can blindly detect
   and process up to 32 concurrent non-overlapping signals, with a variety

Abstract = {{The performance of multichannel transmit coil layouts and parallel
   transmission (pTx) RF pulse design was evaluated with respect to
   transmit B-1 (B-1(+)) homogeneity and specific absorption rate (SAR) at
   3 T for a whole body coil. Five specific coils were modeled and
   compared: a 32-rung birdcage body coil (driven either in a fixed
   quadrature mode or a two-channel transmit mode), two single-ring
   stripline arrays (with either 8 or 16 elements), and two multi-ring
   stripline arrays (with two or three identical rings, stacked in the z
   axis and each comprising eight azimuthally distributed elements). Three
   anatomical targets were considered, each defined by a 3D volume
   representative of a meaningful region of interest (ROI) in routine
   clinical applications. For a given anatomical target, global or local
   SAR controlled pTx pulses were designed to homogenize RF excitation
   within the ROI. At the B-1 (+) homogeneity achieved by the quadrature
   driven birdcage design, pTx pulses with multichannel transmit coils
   achieved up to about eightfold reduction in local and global SAR. When
   used for imaging head and cervical spine or imaging thoracic spine, the
   double-ring array outperformed all coils, including the single-ring
   arrays. While the advantage of the double-ring array became much less
   pronounced for pelvic imaging, with a substantially larger ROI, the pTx
   approach still provided significant gains over the quadrature birdcage
   coil. For all design scenarios, using the three-ring array did not
   necessarily improve the RF performance. Our results suggest that pTx
   pulses with multichannel transmit coils can reduce local and global SAR
   substantially for body coils while attaining improved B-1 (+)
   homogeneity, particularly for a ``z-stacked{''} double-ring design with
   coil elements arranged on two transaxial rings. Copyright (C) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) topological insulators are known for their strong
   spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and the existence of spin-textured surface
   states that might be potentially exploited for ``topological
   spintronics.{''} Here, we use spin pumping and the inverse spin Hall
   effect to demonstrate successful spin injection at room temperature from
   a metallic ferromagnet (CoFeB) into the prototypical 3D topological
   insulator Bi2Se3. The spin pumping process, driven by the magnetization
   dynamics of the metallic ferromagnet, introduces a spin current into the
   topological insulator layer, resulting in a broadening of the
   ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) line width. Theoretical modeling of spin
   pumping through the surface of Bi2Se3, as well as of the measured
   angular dependence of spin-charge conversion signal, suggests that
   pumped spin current is first greatly enhanced by the surface SOC and
   then converted into a dc-voltage signal primarily by the inverse spin
   Hall effect due to SOC of the bulk of Bi2Se3. We find that the FMR line
   width broadens significantly (more than a factor of 5) and we deduce a
   spin Hall angle as large as 0.43 in the Bi2Se3 layer.}},

Abstract = {{The future of regenerative medicine relies on our ability to control
   stem cell fate in order to produce functional tissues. Stem cells are
   the preferred cell source for tissue engineering endeavors and
   regenerative medicine therapies due to their high potency and capacity
   for expansion. However, their potency also makes them very difficult to
   control, as they are in a constant state of flux. Therefore, in order to
   advance research in regenerative medicine, it is necessary to be able to
   monitor cell state and phenotype both in vitro and in vivo. This review
   will detail the imaging technologies currently in use to monitor stem
   cell phenotype, migration, and differentiation. In addition to providing
   examples of the most recent work in this area, we will also discuss the
   future of imaging technologies for regenerative medicine, and how
   current imaging modalities might be utilized to image specific cell
   functionality in order to track stem cell fate. The research area of
   imaging stem cells is progressing toward identifying mature and
   differentiating cells not only by phenotypic markers, but also by
   visualizing cell function. Many of the cutting-edge modalities detailed
   in this review have the potential to be harnessed toward this goal.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper an interactive parametric design-through-analysis platform
   is proposed to help design engineers and analysts make more effective
   use of Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) to improve their product design and
   performance. We develop several Rhinoceros (Rhino) plug-ins to take
   input design parameters through a user-friendly interface, generate
   appropriate surface and/or volumetric models, perform mechanical
   analysis, and visualize the solution fields, all within the same
   Computer-Aided Design (CAD) program. As part of this effort we propose
   and implement graphical generative algorithms for IGA model creation and
   visualization based on Grasshopper, a visual programming interface to
   Rhino. The developed platform is demonstrated on two structural
   mechanics examples an actual wind turbine blade and a model of an
   integrally bladed rotor (IBR). In the latter example we demonstrate how
   the Rhino functionality may be utilized to create conforming volumetric
   models for IGA. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{37}},

Abstract = {{High-speed I/O channels require adaptive techniques to optimize the
   settings for filter tap weights at decision feedback equalization (DFE)
   read channels to compensate for channel inter-symbol interference (ISI)
   and crosstalk from multiple adjacent channels. Both ISI and crosstalk
   tend to vary with channel length, process, and temperature variations.
   Individually optimizing parameters such as those just mentioned leads to
   suboptimal solutions. We propose a joint optimization technique for
   crosstalk cancellation (XTC) at DFE to compensate for both ISI and XTC
   in high-speed I/O channels. The technique is used to compensate for
   between 15.7 dB and 19.7 dB of channel loss combined with a variety of
   crosstalk strengths from 60 mV(p-p), to 180 mV(p-p) adaptively, where
   the transmit non-return-to-zero signal amplitude is a constant 500
   mV(p-p).}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the feasibility of lipid production of Chlorella
   sp. from waste materials. Lipid-extracted microalgal biomass residues
   (LMBRs) and molasses were hydrolyzed, and their hydrolysates were
   analyzed. Five different hydrolysate mixture ratios (w/w) of
   LMBRs/molasses (1/0, 1/1, 1/4, 1/9, and 0/1) were used to cultivate
   Chlorella sp. The results showed that carbohydrate and protein were the
   two main compounds in the LMBRs, and carbohydrate was the main compound
   in the molasses. The highest biomass concentration of 5.58 g/L, Y
   (biomass/sugars) of 0.59 g/g, lipid productivity of 335 mg/L/day, and Y
   (lipids/sugars) of 0.25 g/g were obtained at the hydrolysate mixture
   ratio of LMBRs/molasses of 1/4. High C/N ratio promoted the conversion
   of sugars into lipids. The lipids extracted from Chlorella sp. shared
   similar lipid profile of soybean oil and is therefore a potential viable
   biodiesel feedstock. These results showed that Chlorella sp. can utilize
   mixed sugars and amino acids from LMBRs and molasses to accumulate
   lipids efficiently, thus reducing the cost of microalgal biodiesel
   production and improving its economic viability.}},

Abstract = {{Moisture transport in a food system involving two different materials of
   unequal moisture content was modeled with water activity as the driving
   force using a porous media framework. This model was applied to a
   bread-barbecue chicken pocket sandwich stored in isothermal conditions.
   The model successfully predicted the equilibrium condition, where the
   two materials, bread and chicken, reached the same water activity, but
   not the same water content. The transient changes in the moisture
   content in the bread and chicken were predicted and shown to be
   significantly affected by air gap between the bread and chicken. The
   prediction process was also sensitive to the Darcy permeability values
   for the materials. The modeling framework presented for a sandwich
   system is very general and can easily be extended to other
   multicomponent food systems. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{CrBPF1 overexpression alters transcript levels of terpenoid indole
   alkaloid biosynthetic and regulatory genes}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) biosynthesis in Catharanthus roseus is a
   complex and highly regulated process. Understanding the biochemistry and
   regulation of the TIA pathway is of particular interest as it may allow
   the engineering of plants to accumulate higher levels of
   pharmaceutically important alkaloids. Toward this end, we generated a
   transgenic C. roseus hairy root line that overexpresses the CrBPF1
   transcriptional activator under the control of a beta-estradiol
   inducible promoter. CrBPF1 is a MYB-like protein that was previously
   postulated to help regulate the expression of the TIA biosynthetic gene
   STR. However, the role of CrBPF1 in regulation of the TIA and related
   pathways had not been previously characterized. In this study,
   transcriptional profiling revealed that overexpression of CrBPF1 results
   in increased transcript levels for genes from both the indole and
   terpenoid biosynthetic pathways that provide precursors for TIA
   biosynthesis, as well as for genes in the TIA biosynthetic pathway. In
   addition, overexpression of CrBPF1 causes increases in the transcript
   levels for 11 out of 13 genes postulated to act as transcriptional
   regulators of genes from the TIA and TIA feeder pathways. Interestingly,
   overexpression of CrBPF1 causes increased transcript levels for both TIA
   transcriptional activators and repressors. Despite the fact that CrBPF1
   overexpression affects transcript levels of a large percentage of TIA
   biosynthetic and regulatory genes, CrBPF1 overexpression has only very
   modest effects on the levels of the TIA metabolites analyzed. This
   finding may be due, at least in part, to the up-regulation of both
   transcriptional activators and repressors in response to CrBPF1
   overexpression, suggesting that CrBPF1 may serve as a ``fine-tune{''}
   regulator for TIA biosynthesis, acting to help regulate the timing and
   amplitude of TIA gene expression.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Objective quantification of surgical skill is imperative as
   we enter a healthcare environment of quality improvement and
   performance-based reimbursement. The gold standard tools are
   infrequently used due to time-intensiveness, cost inefficiency, and lack
   of standard practices. We hypothesized that valid performance scores of
   surgical skill can be obtained through crowdsourcing. Methods: Twelve
   surgeons of varying robotic surgical experience performed live porcine
   robot-assisted urinary bladder closures. Blinded video-recorded
   performances were scored by expert surgeon graders and by Amazon's
   Mechanical Turk crowdsourcing crowd workers using the Global Evaluative
   Assessment of Robotic Skills tool assessing five technical skills
   domains. Seven expert graders and 50 unique Mechanical Turkers (each
   paid \$0.75/survey) evaluated each video. Global assessment scores were
   analyzed for correlation and agreement. Results: Six hundred Mechanical
   Turkers completed the surveys in less than 5 hours, while seven surgeon
   graders took 14 days. The duration of video clips ranged from 2 to 11
   minutes. The correlation coefficient between the Turkers' and expert
   graders' scores was 0.95 and Cronbach's Alpha was 0.93. Inter-rater
   reliability among the surgeon graders was 0.89. Conclusion:
   Crowdsourcing surgical skills assessment yielded rapid inexpensive
   agreement with global performance scores given by expert surgeon
   graders. The crowdsourcing method may provide surgical educators and
   medical institutions with a boundless number of procedural skills
   assessors to efficiently quantify technical skills for use in trainee
   advancement and hospital quality improvement.}},

Abstract = {{Both electric fields and temperature gradients can destabilize the
   surface of a thin liquid film and lead to the self-assembly of patterns
   composed of pillar-like structures. Such instabilities offer a
   relatively simple way to tailor the surface topography of coatings,
   which in turn can be used to influence coating appearance, texture, and
   functionality. The present work explores how the simultaneous
   application of an electric field and temperature gradient can be used to
   further influence thin-liquid-film instabilities. Both perfect and leaky
   dielectric materials are considered, and lubrication theory is applied
   to develop a system of nonlinear partial differential equations for the
   interfacial height and charge. Linear stability analysis of the
   lubrication equations shows that in perfect dielectric films, thermal
   effects tend to dominate the process, often rendering the electric field
   unimportant. However, in leaky dielectric films, both the thermal and
   electric fields play important roles and together can produce an
   increase in the growth rate and a reduction in the dominant wavelength
   of the instability. Nonlinear simulations of the lubrication equations
   show that the predictions of the linear theory hold even when the
   interfacial perturbations are no longer small. The effects of
   viscoelasticity are considered within the linear theory, and it is found
   that the growth rate of the instability, but not the length scale,
   depends on the rheological parameters. The findings of this work suggest
   that the simultaneous use of an electric field and temperature gradient
   will allow thin films to be patterned at length scales not accessible
   when only one of these destabilizing forces is used.}},

Abstract = {{Observer design for dynamical systems with both known and unknown
   time-varying parameters is of significant interest in a number of
   real-world applications. This class of systems has been rarely addressed
   in the existing literature. This paper develops an interval observer
   design methodology for linear parameter varying (LPV) systems with
   parametric uncertainty. With information on upper and lower bounds of
   the uncertain parameters, an interval observer that produces an envelope
   covering all possible state trajectories is presented. The application
   of the proposed algorithm in an important vehicle state estimation
   problem which aims at minimizing the worst-case envelope of the
   side-slip-angle estimate in the presence of uncertain tire cornering
   stiffness parameters and varying vehicle speed is presented. The
   obtained observer is evaluated in simulation using CarSim, a commercial
   industry-standard vehicle simulation software. The results verify the
   value of the developed observer design method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A general approach is presented to analyze the worst case input/output
   gain for an interconnection of a linear parameter varying (LPV) system
   and an uncertain or nonlinear element. The LPV system is described by
   state matrices that have an arbitrary, that is not necessarily rational,
   dependence on the parameters. The input/output behavior of the
   nonlinear/uncertain block is described by an integral quadratic
   constraint (IQC). A dissipation inequality is proposed to compute an
   upper bound for this gain. This worst-case gain condition can be
   formulated as a semidefinite program and efficiently solved using
   available optimization software. Moreover, it is shown that this new
   condition is a generalization of the well-known bounded real lemma type
   result for LPV systems. The results contained in this paper complement
   known results that apply IQCs for analysis of LPV systems whose state
   matrices have a rational dependence on the parameters. The effectiveness
   of the proposed method is demonstrated on simple numerical examples.

Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulation (LES) of a three-dimensional, turbulent free
   surface flow past a stream restoration structure with arbitrarily
   complex geometries is presented. The three-dimensional, incompressible,
   spatially filtered Navier-Stokes and continuity equations are solved in
   generalized curvilinear coordinates. For the solution of mixed air-water
   flows, the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB)-level set method
   developed previously is used and extended to carry out LES. Complex
   solid geometries are handled by the sharp-interface CURVIB method, and
   the subgrid scale stress terms arising from the spatial filtering of the
   Navier-Stokes equations are closed by the dynamic Smagorinsky model. To
   demonstrate the potential of the CURVIB-LES-level set model for
   simulating real-life, turbulent free surface flows involving arbitrarily
   complex geometries, LES is carried out for the flow past a complex rock
   structure that is fully submerged in water in a laboratory flume. The
   simulations show that the method is able to predict the time-averaged
   value as well as the root-mean-square fluctuations of water surfaces
   with good accuracy. Moreover, it is seen that the free surface flow at a
   high Froude number causes a significant level of fluctuations of water
   surface elevation and velocity at the water surface. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{Despite attempts to generate interest in science and technology careers,
   US students continue to show reduced interest in science, technology,
   engineering and mathematics (STEM) majors at the collegiate level. If
   girls are not engaged in STEM learning by the middle school level,
   studies show that they are even less likely to choose a science- or
   engineering-related major. This article presents results from a workshop
   for 7th and 8th grade girls designed to promote knowledge building in
   the area of sustainability and alternative energy use in transportation
   and to stimulate greater interest in STEM subjects. The workshop based
   on research conducted at University X focused on basic concepts of
   electric vehicles and electric vehicles' batteries. Tests were conducted
   to evaluate the students' knowledge and perceptions of electric vehicles
   and to determine the impact of the workshop. Early exposure to
   meaningful engineering experiences for these young girls may boost
   interest and the eventual pursuit of engineering and technology

Abstract = {{Components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) have recently been shown to
   influence stem cell specification. However, it has been challenging to
   assess the spatial and temporal dynamics of stem cell-ECM interactions
   because most methodologies utilized to date require sample destruction
   or fixation. We examined the efficacy of utilizing the endogenous
   optical signals of two important ECM proteins, elastin (Eln), through
   autofluorescence, and type I collagen (ColI), through second harmonic
   generation (SHG), during mouse embryonic stem cell differentiation.
   After finding favorable overlap between antibody labeling and the
   endogenous fluorescent signal of Eln, we used this endogenous signal to
   map temporal changes in Eln and ColI during murine embryoid body
   differentiation and found that Eln increases until day 9 and then
   decreases slightly by day 12, while Col1 steadily increases over the
   12-day period. Furthermore, we combined endogenous fluorescence imaging
   and SHG with antibody labeling of cardiomyocytes to examine the spatial
   relationship between Eln and ColI accumulation and cardiomyocyte
   differentiation. Eln was ubiquitously present, with enrichment in
   regions with cardiomyocyte differentiation, while there was an inverse
   correlation between ColI and cardiomyocyte differentiation. This work
   provides an important first step for utilizing endogenous optical
   signals, which can be visualized in living cells, to understand the
   relationship between the ECM and cardiomyocyte development and sets the
   stage for future studies of stem cell-ECM interactions and dynamics
   relevant to stem cells as well as other cell and tissue types.}},

Abstract = {{Researchers use protocols to screen for suspicious survey submissions in

   cross-validation process detected invalid entries. Data were from the
   Sexually Explicit Media Study, an Internet-based HIV prevention survey
   of men who have sex with men. Using our protocol, 146 (11.6 \%) of 1254
   entries were identified as invalid. Most indicated changes to the
   screening questionnaire to gain entry (n = 109, 74.7 \%), matched other
   submissions' payment profiles (n = 56, 41.8 \%), or featured an IP
   address that was recorded previously (n = 43, 29.5 \%). We found few
   demographic or behavioral differences between valid and invalid samples,
   however. Invalid submissions had lower odds of reporting HIV testing in
   the past year (OR 0.63), and higher odds of requesting no payment
   compared to check payments (OR 2.75). Thus, rates of HIV testing would
   have been underestimated if invalid submissions had not been removed,
   and payment may not be the only incentive for invalid participation.}},

Abstract = {{We present an algorithm for morphing shape and view-dependent texture
   that utilizes an unstructured lumigraph representation to (1) gracefully
   handle topological changes, (2) create plausible appearance
   transformations, and (3) provide user control independent from the
   underlying mesh structure. It works by reducing the otherwise complex
   problem of a 3D shape and material morph into multiple simpler 2D
   morphs. The shape morph operates on 2D depth maps and then reconstructs
   a conventional mesh, making it insensitive to the input geometry
   quality. Our morphing algorithm robustly handles topology changes and
   outputs complete meshes and lumigraphs for later use. We show how 2D
   image morphs can be computed from 3D correspondences, while eliminating
   ambiguities that might result in the projected 2D morphs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{An efficient fan drive system based on a novel pressure-controlled
   hydraulic transmission (PCT) is studied in this paper. The new
   transmission uses a double-acting vane pump with a floating ring. By
   coupling the floating ring to an output shaft, the vane pump becomes a
   hydraulic transmission. The new transmission combines pumping and
   motoring functions in one unit, making it much simpler than a
   conventional hydrostatic transmission (HST). By controlling the pressure
   in the PCT, the output shaft torque and speed can be adjusted. In this
   paper, the fundamental principle of the new transmission is studied,
   with the focus on how the output shaft torque is influenced by the
   control pressure. To demonstrate its advantages, the new transmission is
   applied to a fan drive system, and the transmission efficiency is
   compared to an HST. Experimental results show that the input power of
   the fan drive system with the PCT is lower than that with an HST. By
   feeding the control flow to a hydraulic motor coupled to the output
   shaft of the PCT, a pressure-controlled hydromechanical transmission is
   constituted and the test result shows higher transmission efficiency
   than a PCT.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for view-dependent cloth simulation using
   dynamically adaptive mesh refinement and coarsening. Given a prescribed
   camera motion, the method adjusts the criteria controlling refinement to
   account for visibility and apparent size in the camera's view.
   Objectionable dynamic artifacts are avoided by anticipative refinement
   and smoothed coarsening, while locking in extremely coarsened regions is
   inhibited by modifying the material model to compensate for unresolved
   sub-element buckling. This approach preserves the appearance of detailed
   cloth throughout the animation while avoiding the wasted effort of
   simulating details that would not be discernible to the viewer. The
   computational savings realized by this method increase as scene
   complexity grows. The approach produces a 2x speed-up for a single
   character and more than 4x for a small group as compared to
   view-independent adaptive simulations, and respectively 5x and 9x
   speed-ups as compared to non-adaptive simulations.}},

Abstract = {{The first global survey of bariatric/metabolic surgery based on data
   from the nations or national groupings of the International Federation
   for the Surgery of Obesity and Metabolic Diseases (IFSO) was published
   in 1998, followed by reports in 2003, 2009, 2011, and 2012. In this
   survey, we report a global overview of worldwide bariatric surgery in
   2013.
   A questionnaire evaluating the number and the type of bariatric
   procedure performed in 2013 was emailed to all members of bariatric
   societies belonging to IFSO. Trend analyses from 2003 to 2013 were also
   performed.
   There were 49/54 (90.7 \%) responders; 37 of the 49 with national
   registries. The total number of bariatric procedures performed worldwide
   in 2013 was 468,609, 95.7 \% carried out laparoscopically. The highest
   number (n = 154,276) was from the USA/Canada region. The most commonly
   performed procedure in the world was Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), 45
   \%; followed by sleeve gastrectomy (SG), 37 \%; and adjustable gastric
   banding (AGB), 10 \%. Most significant were the rise in prevalence of SG
   from 0 to 37 \% of the world total from 2003 to 2013, and the fall in
   AGB of 68 \% from its peak in 2008 to 2013.
   SG is currently the most frequently performed procedure in the
   USA/Canada and in the Asia/Pacific regions, and second to RYGB in the

Title = {{Synthesizing cubes to satisfy a given intersection pattern}},
Journal = {{DISCRETE APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{193}},
Pages = {{11-38}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{In two-level logic synthesis, the typical input specification is a set
   of minterms defining the on set and a set of minterms defining the don't
   care set of a Boolean function. The problem is to synthesize an optimal
   set of product terms, or cubes, that covers all the minterms in the on
   set and some of the minterms in the don't care set. In this paper, we
   consider a different specification: instead of the on set and the don't
   care set, we are given a set of numbers, each of which specifies the
   number of minterms covered by the intersection of one of the subsets of
   a set of lambda cubes. We refer to the given set of numbers as an
   intersection pattern. The problem is to determine whether there exists a
   set of lambda cubes that satisfies the given intersection pattern and,
   if it exists, to synthesize the set of cubes. We show a necessary and
   sufficient condition for the existence of lambda cubes to satisfy a
   given intersection pattern. We also show that the synthesis problem can
   be reduced to the problem of finding a non-negative solution to a set of
   linear equations and inequalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   polynomial-time via Semidefinite Relaxation followed by spectral
   factorization. Furthermore, if the matrices are circulant, then the QCQP

Abstract = {{SrTiO3 (STO) epitaxial thin films and heterostructures are of
   considerable interest due to the wide range of functionalities they
   exhibit. The alloy perovskite (LaAlO3)(0.3)-(Sr2AlTaO6)(0.7) (LSAT) is
   commonly used as a substrate for these material structures due to its
   structural compatibility with STO and the strain-induced ferroelectric
   response in STO films grown on LSAT. However, surprisingly little is
   known about the electronic properties of the STO/LSAT interface despite
   its potentially important role in affecting the overall electronic
   structure of system. We examine the band alignment of STO/LSAT
   heterostructures using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy for epitaxial
   STO films deposited using two different molecular beam epitaxy
   approaches. We find that the valence band offset ranges from -0.2(1) eV
   to -0.2(1) eV depending on the film surface termination. From these
   results, we extract a conduction band offset from -2.4(1) eV to -2.8(1)
   eV, indicating that the conduction band edge is more deeply bound in STO
   and that LSAT will not act as a sink or trap for electrons in the
   supported film or multilayer. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{The power output of an organic photovoltaic cell (OPV) depends on the
   relationship between device voltage and charge carrier recombination
   rate. Suppressing recombination until higher voltages allows for
   increased photocurrent leading to a concomitant increase in power
   generated. Despite the important role played by recombination in OPVs,
   its dependence on voltage remains understudied. This is mainly because
   most techniques used to measure recombination rates are only applicable
   under open-circuit conditions. In order to address recombination away
   from open-circuit, a modified charge extraction technique is used to
   empirically determine the relationship between charge carrier density
   and device voltage. This relationship, in conjunction with the device
   photocurrent density-voltage characteristic, is sufficient to connect
   the recombination rate at open-circuit to any operating voltage. (C)

Title = {{Accurate and precise determination of critical properties from Gibbs
   ensemble Monte Carlo simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 21}},
Abstract = {{Since the seminal paper by Panagiotopoulos {[}Mol. Phys. 61, 813
   (1997)], the Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) method has been the most
   popular particle-based simulation approach for the computation of
   vapor-liquid phase equilibria. However, the validity of GEMC simulations
   in the near-critical region has been questioned because rigorous
   finite-size scaling approaches cannot be applied to simulations with
   fluctuating volume. Valleau {[}Mol. Simul. 29, 627 (2003)] has argued
   that GEMC simulations would lead to a spurious overestimation of the
   critical temperature. More recently, Patel et al. {[}J. Chem. Phys. 134,
   024101 (2011)] opined that the use of analytical tail corrections would
   be problematic in the near-critical region. To address these issues, we
   perform extensive GEMC simulations for Lennard-Jones particles in the
   near-critical region varying the system size, the overall system
   density, and the cutoff distance. For a system with N = 5500 particles,
   potential truncation at 8s and analytical tail corrections, an
   extrapolation of GEMC simulation data at temperatures in the range from
   1.27 to 1.305 yields T-c = 1.3128 +/- 0.0016, rho(c) = 0.316 +/- 0.004,
   and p(c) = 0.1274 +/- 0.0013 in excellent agreement with the
   thermodynamic limit determined by Potoff and Panagiotopoulos {[}J. Chem.
   Phys. 109, 10914 (1998)] using grand canonical Monte Carlo simulations
   and finite-size scaling. Critical properties estimated using GEMC
   simulations with different overall system densities (0.296 <= rho(t) <=
   0.336) agree to within the statistical uncertainties. For simulations
   with tail corrections, data obtained using r(cut) = 3.5s yield Tc and pc
   that are higher by 0.2\% and 1.4\% than simulations with r(cut) <= 5 and
   8 sigma but still with overlapping 95\% confidence intervals. In
   contrast, GEMC simulations with a truncated and shifted potential show
   that r(cut) = 8 sigma is insufficient to obtain accurate results.
   Additional GEMC simulations for hard-core square-well particles with
   various ranges of the attractive well and for n-decane molecules
   represented by the TraPPE force field yield data that support the trends
   observed for Lennard-Jones particles. The finite-size dependence of the
   critical properties obtained from GEMC simulations is significantly
   smaller than those from grand-canonical ensemble simulations. Thus, when
   resources are not available for a rigorous finite-size scaling study,
   GEMC simulations provide a straightforward route to determine fairly
   accurate critical properties using relatively small system sizes. (C)

Abstract = {{Strong coherent interactions between colocalized optical and mechanical
   eigenmodes of various cavity optomechanical systems have been explored
   intensively toward quantum information processing using both photons and
   phonons. In contrast to localized modes, propagating mechanical waves
   are another form of phonons that can be guided and manipulated like
   photons in engineered phononic structures. Here, we demonstrate
   sideband-resolved coupling between multiple photonic nanocavities and
   propagating surface acoustic waves up to 12 GHz. Coherent and strong
   photon-phonon interaction is manifested with electro-optomechanically
   induced transparency, absorption, and amplification, and phase-coherent
   interaction in multiple cavities. Inside an echo chamber, it is shown
   that a phonon pulse can interact with an embedded nanocavity for
   multiple times. Our device provides a scalable platform to
   optomechanically couple phonons and photons for microwave photonics and
   quantum photonics. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Predicting an individual's risk of experiencing a future clinical
   outcome is a statistical task with important consequences for both
   practicing clinicians and public health experts. Modern observational
   databases such as electronic health records provide an alternative to
   the longitudinal cohort studies traditionally used to construct risk
   models, bringing with them both opportunities and challenges. Large
   sample sizes and detailed covariate histories enable the use of
   sophisticated machine learning techniques to uncover complex
   associations and interactions, but observational databases are often
   messy', with high levels of missing data and incomplete patient
   follow-up. In this paper, we propose an adaptation of the well-known
   Naive Bayes machine learning approach to time-to-event outcomes subject
   to censoring. We compare the predictive performance of our method with
   the Cox proportional hazards model which is commonly used for risk
   prediction in healthcare populations, and illustrate its application to
   prediction of cardiovascular risk using an electronic health record
   dataset from a large Midwest integrated healthcare system. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{Vascular smooth muscle cells' primary function is to maintain vascular
   homeostasis through active contraction and relaxation. In diseases such
   as hypertension and atherosclerosis, this function is inhibited
   concurrent to changes in the mechanical environment surrounding vascular
   smooth muscle cells. It is well established that cell function and
   extracellular mechanics are interconnected; variations in substrate
   modulus affect cell migration, proliferation, and differentiation. To
   date, it is unknown how the evolving extracellular mechanical
   environment of vascular smooth muscle cells affects their contractile
   function. Here, we have built upon previous vascular muscular thin film
   technology to develop a variable-modulus vascular muscular thin film
   that measures vascular tissue functional contractility on substrates
   with a range of pathological and physiological moduli. Using this
   modified vascular muscular thin film, we found that vascular smooth
   muscle cells generated greater stress on substrates with higher moduli
   compared to substrates with lower moduli. We then measured protein
   markers typically thought to indicate a contractile phenotype in
   vascular smooth muscle cells and found that phenotype is unaffected by
   substrate modulus. These data suggest that mechanical properties of
   vascular smooth muscle cells' extracellular environment directly
   influence their functional behavior and do so without inducing phenotype
   switching. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{High-Throughput Ligand Discovery Reveals a Sitewise Gradient of
   Diversity in Broadly Evolved Hydrophilic Fibronectin Domains}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 18}},
Abstract = {{Discovering new binding function via a combinatorial library in small
   protein scaffolds requires balance between appropriate mutations to
   introduce favorable intermolecular interactions while maintaining
   intramolecular integrity. Sitewise constraints exist in a non-spatial
   gradient from diverse to conserved in evolved antibody repertoires; yet
   non-antibody scaffolds generally do not implement this strategy in
   combinatorial libraries. Despite the fact that biased amino acid
   distributions, typically elevated in tyrosine, serine, and glycine, have
   gained wider use in synthetic scaffolds, these distributions are still
   predominantly applied uniformly to diversified sites. While select sites
   in fibronectin domains and DARPins have shown benefit from sitewise
   designs, they have not been deeply evaluated. Inspired by this disparity
   between diversity distributions in natural libraries and synthetic
   scaffold libraries, we hypothesized that binders resulting from
   discovery and evolution would exhibit a non-spatial, sitewise gradient
   of amino acid diversity. To identify sitewise diversities consistent
   with efficient evolution in the context of a hydrophilic fibronectin
   domain, >10(5) binders to six targets were evolved and sequenced.
   Evolutionarily favorable amino acid distributions at 25 sites reveal
   Shannon entropies (range: 0.3-3.9; median: 2.1; standard deviation: 1.1)
   supporting the diversity gradient hypothesis. Sitewise constraints in
   evolved sequences are consistent with complementarity, stability, and
   consensus biases. Implementation of sitewise constrained diversity
   enables direct selection of nanomolar affinity binders validating an
   efficient strategy to balance inter-and intra-molecular interaction
   demands at each site.}},

   through a flexible polymer tube}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{338}},
Pages = {{418-421}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{A new tribometer has been developed for the measurement of sliding
   friction between a stationary flexible polymeric sleeve and a rigid
   metallic rod that moves longitudinally within the sleeve. The tribometer
   enables both the normal and pull forces to be controlled and measured to
   high accuracy. The pull force was provided by an adaptation of a tensile
   testing machine which imparts a precisely controlled linear motion to
   the sliding tribopartner. Direct measurement of the normal force at the
   interface between the tribopartners is not necessary since it can be
   determined to very high accuracy by the innovative use of numerical
   simulation. Prior to its application to a specific physical situation,
   numerous replicate experiments were performed which demonstrated
   virtually perfect reproducibility. The tribmeter was applied to
   determine the relationship between the extent of plasma processing of
   the bore of a flexible polymeric tube and the coefficient of friction
   between the tube and a stainless steel rod sliding within the silicone
   tube. This situation frequently arises in connection with therapeutic
   biomedical devices. The coefficients of friction determined from the
   experiments displayed a monotonic decrease as the extent of processing
   increased. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Experimental study of heat transfer enhancement in a liquid piston
   compressor/expander using porous media inserts}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{154}},
Pages = {{40-50}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{The efficiency and power density of gas compression and expansion are
   strongly dependent on heat transfer during the process. Since porous
   media inserts can significantly increase heat transfer surface area,
   their addition to a liquid piston compressor/expander has been
   hypothesized to reduce the time to complete the compression or expansion
   process and hence the power density for a given thermodynamic
   efficiency; or to increase the thermodynamic efficiency at a fixed power
   density. This paper presents an experimental investigation on heat
   transfer with porous inserts during compression for a pressure ratio of
   10 and during expansion for a pressure ratio of 6. A baseline case
   without inserts and five cases with different porous inserts are tested
   in a compression experiment: 3 interrupted ABS inserts with plate
   spacing of 2.5, 5, and 10 mm and 2 aluminum foam inserts sized with 10
   and 40 pores per inch. The 2.5 mm and 5 mm interrupted plate inserts
   were also tested in expansion experiments. Porous inserts are found, in
   compression, to increase power-density by 39-fold at 95\% efficiency and
   to increase efficiency by 18\% at 100 kW/m(3) power density; in
   expansion, power density is increased three fold at 89\% efficiency, and
   efficiency is increased by 7\% at 150 kW/m(3). Surface area increase is
   found to be the predominant cause in the improvement in performance.
   Thus, a liquid piston compressor/expander together with a porous medium
   may be used in applications requiring high compression ratios, high
   efficiencies, and high power density such as in an open-accumulator
   compressed air energy storage (CAES) system or a compressor for
   compressed natural gas (CNG). (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{gamma'-Fe4N thin films with good soft magnetic properties were
   successfully prepared on single crystal Si (1 0 0) and GaAs(1 0 0)
   substrates with Fe buffer layer by facing target magnetron sputtering.
   The microstructure and magnetic properties of the samples at low
   temperature were investigated. Both structural and magnetic properties
   of the films were shown to be influenced by the substrate. Specifically,
   the film deposited on the GaAs exhibited a strong preferred orientation
   along the (1 0 0) plane, while the film deposited on Si exhibited higher
   saturation magnetization (Ms) and lower coercivity (Hc). The results
   suggest that the coercivity is probably related to the intrinsic stress
   and that Ms increases whereas Hc decreases with decreasing lattice
   mismatch. The Mr/Ms ratio decreased with decreasing temperature due to
   the effect of the thermal disturbance on the magnetization. Both films
   had a single easy magnetized direction parallel to the substrate plane.

Abstract = {{The biodiesel industry generates glycerol as a main by-product, and the
   conversion of glycerol to value-added products is an important issue.
   Glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) can catalyze the conversion of glycerol to
   dihydroxyacetone (DHA), which is used as a tanning agent in cosmetics
   and is much more expensive than glycerol. In this study, GDH was
   adsorbed into magnetically-separable mesoporous silica with 38 nm
   mesocellular pores connected via 18 nm window rhesopores (adsorbed GDH,
   called ADS), and further crosslinked via a simple glutaraldehyde
   treatment to prepare nanoscale enzyme reactors of GDH (NERs of GDH,
   called NER). When the stabilities of free and immobilized GDH were
   monitored in an aqueous buffer under shaking (200 rpm), the residual
   activities of the free GDH and ADS could no longer be detected after 8
   days and 22 days, respectively, while the NER maintained 64\% of its
   initial activity even after 24-day incubation. The time-dependent
   conversion of glycerol to DHA was measured for both ADS and NER not only
   by analyzing the generation of NADH spectrophotometrically (340 nm) but
   also via the HPLC analysis measuring the increase of the DHA peak.
   Magnetically-separable NER maintained 39\% of its initial activity after
   seven cycles of repeated use, while the residual activity of ADS dropped
   to 13\% of its initial activity after only two recycled uses. (C) 2015

Title = {{Analysis of heterogeneous water vapor uptake by metal iodide cluster
   ions via differential mobility analysis-mass spectrometry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{The sorption of vapor molecules onto pre-existing nanometer sized
   clusters is of importance in understanding particle formation and growth
   in gas phase environments and devising gas phase separation schemes.
   Here, we apply a differential mobility analyzer-mass spectrometer based
   approach to observe directly the sorption of vapor molecules onto iodide
   cluster ions of the form (MI)(x)M+ (x = 113, M = Na, K, Rb, or Cs) in
   air at 300 K and with water saturation ratios in the 0.01-0.64 range.
   The extent of vapor sorption is quantified in measurements by the shift
   in collision cross section (CCS) for each ion. We find that CCS
   measurements are sensitive enough to detect the transient binding of
   several vapor molecules to clusters, which shift CCSs by only several
   percent. At the same time, for the highest saturation ratios examined,
   we observed CCS shifts of up to 45\%. For x < 4, cesium, rubidium, and
   potassium iodide cluster ions are found to uptake water to a similar
   extent, while sodium iodide clusters uptake less water. For x >= 4,
   sodium iodide cluster ions uptake proportionally more water vapor than
   rubidium and potassium iodide cluster ions, while cesium iodide ions
   exhibit less uptake. Measured CCS shifts are compared to predictions
   based upon a Kelvin-Thomson-Raoult (KTR) model as well as a Langmuir
   adsorption model. We find that the Langmuir adsorption model can be fit
   well to measurements. Meanwhile, KTR predictions deviate from
   measurements, which suggests that the earliest stages of vapor uptake by
   nanometer scale species are not well described by the KTR model. (C)

Title = {{Study of the stability against toppling of rock blocks with rounded

Journal = {{ENGINEERING GEOLOGY}},

Volume = {{195}},
Pages = {{172-184}},

Abstract = {{Rounding of edges in rock blocks is a characteristic feature of
   spheroidal weathering. The objective of this paper is to examine the
   influence of edge rounding for rectangular prismatic blocks on the
   mechanical stability of the blocks against toppling at both laboratory
   and field scales. Equations for computing factors of safety against
   toppling and sliding for rectangular prismatic blocks resting on
   inclined surfaces are discussed first. The equations consider the
   situation of blocks with sharp edges and with assumed circular rounded
   edges. The analytical formulae show that rounding of the edges does not
   have influence on the factor of safety against sliding, but has
   influence on the factor of safety against toppling. In the latter case,
   the equations that do not account for rounding of the edges are shown to
   overpredict the stability conditions of the rock blocks against
   toppling. Results from a series of laboratory tests using a tilt table
   to estimate the factor of safety at the critical condition for toppling
   of blocks at laboratory scale are discussed next. The laboratory results
   show that for rock blocks with rounded edges produced by a process of
   abrasion in a slake durability machine, an overestimation of up to 30\%
   or more for the factor of safety against toppling is expected when using
   classical stability formulae that disregard the curvature of the edges.
   Finally, stability analysis of large natural rock blocks in the field
   that show spheroidal weathering, confirm the overestimation of stability
   conditions predicted by the formulae that do not account for the
   rounding of the edges. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{The plasticity and immunomodulatory capacity of mesenchymal stem cells
   (MSCs) have spurred clinical use in recent years. However, clinical
   outcomes vary and many ascribe inconsistency to the tissue source of
   MSCs. Yet unconsidered is the extent of heterogeneity of individual MSCs
   from a given tissue source with respect to differentiation potential and
   immune regulatory function. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq to assess
   the transcriptional diversity of murine mesenchymal stem cells derived
   from bone marrow. We found genes associated with MSC multipotency were
   expressed at a high level and with consistency between individual cells.
   However, genes associated with osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic,
   neurogenic and vascular smooth muscle differentiation were expressed at
   widely varying levels between individual cells. Further, certain genes
   associated with immunomodulation were also inconsistent between
   individual cells. Differences could not be ascribed to cycles of
   proliferation, culture bias or other cellular process, which might alter
   transcript expression in a regular or cyclic pattern. These results
   support and extend the concept of lineage priming of MSCs and emphasize
   caution for in vivo or clinical use of MSCs, even when immunomodulation
   is the goal, since multiple mesodermal (and even perhaps ectodermal)
   outcomes are a possibility. Purification might enable shifting of the
   probability of a certain outcome, but is unlikely to remove multilineage
   potential altogether.}},

   Skills and Predict Team Performance}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 9}},
Abstract = {{Player tracking data represents a revolutionary new data source for
   basketball analysis, in which essentially every aspect of a player's
   performance is tracked and can be analyzed numerically. We suggest a way
   by which this data set, when coupled with a network-style model of the
   offense that relates players' skills to the team's success at running
   different plays, can be used to automatically learn players' skills and
   predict the performance of untested 5-man lineups in a way that accounts
   for the interaction between players' respective skill sets. After
   developing a general analysis procedure, we present as an example a
   specific implementation of our method using a simplified network model.
   While player tracking data is not yet available in the public domain, we
   evaluate our model using simulated data and show that player skills can
   be accurately inferred by a simple statistical inference scheme.
   Finally, we use the model to analyze games from the 2011 playoff series
   between the Memphis Grizzlies and the Oklahoma City Thunder and we show
   that, even with a very limited data set, the model can consistently
   describe a player's interactions with a given lineup based only on his
   performance with a different lineup.}},

Abstract = {{J-hook vanes are geometrically complex rock structures that are used
   extensively in stream and river restoration. We employ the St Anthony
   Falls Laboratory Virtual StreamLab (VSL3D) code to elucidate the flow
   and transport phenomena induced by such structures in large rivers and
   develop design guidelines based on this physical understanding. The
   unsteady Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes module of the VSL3D model with
   the k - closure is used to carry out coupled hydro-morphodynamic
   simulations in waterways with complex hydraulic structures. We construct
   two virtual river geometries, representative of gravel and sand-bed
   rivers in nature, and employ them for developing design guidelines for
   J-hook vanes. We systematically simulate numerous arrangements of J-hook
   vanes to understand physical mechanisms via which such structures modify
   turbulent flow and sediment transport processes depending on river
   environment and structure layout. The resulting physical insights are
   then distilled into a set of physics-based design guidelines for optimal
   structure design and placement in large rivers.}},

Abstract = {{Surface properties of aqueous solutions are important for environments
   as diverse as atmospheric aerosols and biocellular membranes.
   Previously, we developed a surface tension model for both electrolyte
   and nonelectrolyte aqueous solutions across the entire solute
   concentration range (Wexler and Dutcher, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2013, 4,
   1723-1726). The model differentiated between adsorption of solute
   molecules in the bulk and surface of solution using the statistical
   mechanics of multilayer sorption solution model of Dutcher et al. (J.
   Phys. Chem. A 2013, 117, 3198-3213). The parameters in the model had
   physicochemical interpretations, but remained largely empirical. In the
   current work, these parameters are related to solute molecular
   properties in aqueous solutions. For nonelectrolytes, sorption
   tendencies suggest a strong relation with molecular size and functional
   group spacing. For electrolytes, surface adsorption of ions follows ion
   surface-bulk partitioning calculations by Pegram and Record (J. Phys.
   Chem. B 2007, 111, 5411-5417).}},

Abstract = {{For infants born with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), liquid bolus
   delivery of surfactant administered through an endotracheal tube is
   common practice. While this method is generally effective, complications
   such as transient hypoxia, hypercapnia, and altered cerebral blood flow
   may occur. Aerosolized surfactant therapy has been explored as an
   alternative. Unfortunately, past efforts have led to disappointing
   results as aerosols were generated outside the lungs with significant
   pharyngeal deposition and minimal intrapulmonary instillation. A novel
   aerosol generator (Microjet) is evaluated herein for intrapulmonary
   aerosol generation within an endotracheal tube and tested with Curosurf
   and Infasurf surfactants. Compared with other aerosol delivery devices,
   this process utilizes low air flow (range 0.01-0.2L min(-1)) that is
   ideal for limiting potential barotrauma to the premature newborn lung.
   The mass mean diameter (MMD) of the particles for both tested
   surfactants was less than 4m, which is ideal for both uniform and distal
   lung delivery. As an indicator of phospholipid function, surfactant
   surface tension was measured before and after aerosol formationwith no
   significant difference. Moreover, this device has an outside diameter of
   <1mm, which permits insertion into an endotracheal tube (of even 2.0mm).
   In the premature infant where intravenous access is either technically
   challenging or difficult, aerosol drug delivery may provide an
   alternative route in patient resuscitation, stabilization, and care.
   Other potential applications of this type of device include the delivery
   of nutrients, antibiotics, and analgesics via the pulmonary
   route.Copyright 2015 American Association for Aerosol Research}},

Abstract = {{Ambient air pollution in China has worsened following dramatic increases
   in industrialization, automobile use and energy consumption.
   Particularly bothersome is the increase in the PM2.5 fraction of
   pollutants. This fraction has been associated with increasing rates of
   cardio-respiratory disease in China and elsewhere. Ambient pollutant
   levels have been described in many of China's cities and are comparable
   to previous levels in southern California. Lung cancer mortality in
   China has increased since the 1970s and has been higher in men and in
   urban areas, the exact explanation for which has not been determined.
   The estimation of individual risk for Chinese citizens living in areas
   of air pollution will require further research. Occupational cohort and
   case-control designs each have unique attributes that could make them
   helpful to use in this setting. Other important future research
   considerations include detailed exposure assessment and the possible use
   of biomarkers as a means to better understand and manage the threat
   posed by air pollution in China.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to measure the long-term odor emissions
   and corresponding concentrations and emissions of 20 odorous volatile
   organic compounds (VOCs). This study was an add-on study to the National
   Air Emission Monitoring Study (NAEMS). Odor and odorous gas measurements
   at four NAEMS sites, including dairy barns in Wisconsin (WI5B) and
   Indiana (IN5B), a swine finisher barn in Indiana (IN3B), and swine
   gestation and farrowing barns in Iowa (IA4B), were conducted from
   November 2007 to May 2009. The odorous gas samples were collected every
   two weeks using sorbent tubes (samples were collected twice each season
   of the year, with the exception of spring 2009 when samples were
   collected three times) and analyzed by gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O). In this article, we summarize the
   measured gas concentrations and emissions of the 20 target VOCs from
   each of the four sites. The average total odorous VOC concentrations for
   the entire sampling period were 276, 96.9, 1413 and 394 mu g dsm(-3) for
   WI5B, IN5B, IN3B, and IA4B, respectively. For the swine sites, the
   highest seasonal average total odorous VOC concentrations for each barn
   were observed during spring (1890 mu g dsm(-3) for IN3B and 458 mu g
   dsm(-3) for IA4B). For the dairy sites, the highest seasonal average
   total odorous VOC concentrations were observed in winter at WI5B (446 mu
   g dsm(-3)) and in summer at IN5B (129 mu g dsm(-3)). The average total
   emission rates for the 20 odorous VOCs were 290 mg h(-1) AU(-1) (WI5B),
   36.0 mg h(-1) AU(-1) (IN5B), 743 mg h(-1) AU(-1) (IN3B), 33.9 mg h(-1)
   AU(-1) (IA4B swine gestation barns), and 91.7 mg h(-1) AU(-1) (IA4B
   swine farrowing room). The average seasonal total odorous VOC emission
   rates were highest during summer at WI5B (805 mg h(-1) AU(-1)), IN5B
   (121 mg h(-1) AU(-1)), and IN3B (1250 mg h(-1) AU(-1)) and during spring
   at IA4B (95.8 mg h(-1) AU(-1)). The emissions of specific VOCs varied
   between seasons, sites, and species. To date, this is the most
   comprehensive VOC measurement survey of odorous compound emission rates
   from commercial livestock buildings.}},

Abstract = {{Simultaneous chemical and sensory analyses using gas chromatography-mass
   spectrometry-olfactometry (GC-MS-O) for air samples collected at barn
   exhaust fans were used for quantification and ranking of the odor
   impacts of target odorous gases. Fifteen target odorous VOCs (odorants)
   were selected Air samples were collected at dairy barns in Wisconsin and
   Indiana and at swine barns in Iowa and Indiana over a one-year period
   The livestock facilities with these barns participated in the National
   Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). Gas concentrations, odor
   character and intensity, hedonic tone, and odor peak area of the target
   odorants in air samples were measured simultaneously with GC-MS-O. The
   four individual odorants emitted from both dairy and swine sites with
   the largest odor impacts (measured as odor activity value, OAV) were
   4-methyl phenol, butanoic acid, 3-methyl butanoic acid, and indole. The
   total odor (limited to target VOCs and referred to as the measured
   concentrations, odor intensities, and OAVs) emitted from the swine sites
   was generally greater than that from the dairy sites. The Weber-Fechner
   law was used to correlate measured odor intensities with chemical
   concentrations. Odorants with higher mean OAV followed the Weber-Fechner
   law much better than odorants with lower mean OAV. The correlations
   between odor intensities and chemical concentrations were much better
   for the swine sites (typically p < 0.05 and R-2 = 0.16 to 0.51) than for
   the dairy sites (typically p > 0.05 and R-2 < 0.15). Linking specific
   gases to odor could assist in the development and evaluation of odor
   mitigation technologies for solving livestock odor nuisance problems.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{This article focuses on the influence of noise and vibration on chest
   sound measurements with a piezoelectric stethoscope. Two types of
   vibrations, namely inputs through the patient chest and disturbances
   from the physician, influence the acoustic measurement. The goal of this
   work is to develop a model to understand the propagation of these
   vibrational noises through the stethoscope and to the piezoelectric
   sensing element. Using the model, methods to reduce the influence of
   disturbances acting on the stethoscope from the physician handling the
   device are explored.
   A multi-DOF rigid body vibration model consisting of discrete connected
   components is developed for the piezoelectric stethoscope. Using a
   two-port lumped parameter model, the mechanical vibrations are related
   to the resulting electrical signal. The parameterized state space model
   is experimentally validated and its parameters are identified by using a
   thorax simulator and vibration shaker. Based on predictions from the
   model, the introduction of vibration isolation to reduce the influence
   of physician noise on the transducer is then pursued. It is shown that
   direct vibration isolation between the transducer and the rest of the
   stethoscope structure leads to a reduction in coupling with the
   patient's chest. However, if isolation is instead introduced between the
   transducer housing and the rest of the stethoscope, then vibration
   isolation from the physician is achieved with far less reduction in
   patient coupling. Experimental results are presented to study the
   influence of the proposed design changes and confirm the predicted model
   behavior.}},

   choosing proper discretization schemes to numerically solve

   desirable properties of the discretization schemes. We use the recently
   developed alpha point-queue model as an example. We first develop
   theoretical results to prove the consistency, stability and convergence
   of the implicit and explicit discretization schemes for solving the
   alpha point-queue model. We then conduct numerical experiments to show
   such results accordingly. We also discuss the implications of the

Abstract = {{We develop an approximation scheme, called ``pseudo-derivative (PD){''}
   to solving the dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) problem. The PD
   approximation can convert time-varying, state dependent delays usually
   involved in DUE to a constant time delay. We study the properties of the
   proposed PD and the resulting approximate DUE (ADUE) problem after
   applying the approximation. Some issues of the ADUE, such as the
   possible violation of the flow conservation at network nodes are also
   discussed and resolved. It turns out that the original DUE problem can
   be solved iteratively with an ADUE solved in each iteration. Numerical
   results are shown on a small test network and the Sioux Falls network.
   The results show that the iterative algorithm can converge to some
   reasonable solution, although a formal convergence proof result is not
   established in the paper.}},

Abstract = {{Although the boundedly rational (BR) day-to-day dynamic proposed in Guo
   and Liu (Transp Res B 45(10):1606-1618, 2011) managed to model drivers'
   transient behaviour under disequilibrium in response to a network
   change, its stability property remains unanswered. To better understand
   the boundedly rational (BR) dynamic, this paper initiates the stability
   analysis of the BR dynamic. As we will show, the BR dynamic is a
   piecewise affine linear system consisting of multiple subsystems. The
   conventional Lyapunov theorem commonly used in the literature cannot be
   applied and thus a multiple Lyapunov method is adopted. The multiple
   Lyapunov method requires that the Lyapunov values decrease when
   trajectories evolve as time elapses and the decreasing rate is bounded
   above. We can show that within each subsystem, the Lyapunov function
   decreases at an exponential rate. Meanwhile, when trajectories reach
   boundaries between subsystems, they can either slide or switch and the
   Lyapunov value also changes across subsystems at a negative rate.
   Therefore, the BR dynamic is stable. A small network example is given to
   illustrate this method.}},

   control also adjusts its plan from day to day in response to the route
   choices of travelers. We show that this joint dynamical system has a set
   of fixed points in which both the user equilibrium is achieved and the
   traffic signal converges to a fixed-time plan. We address equilibrium
   stability and convergence of this joint dynamical system through
   analyzing the Jacobian matrix associated with each fixed point. We
   demonstrate the attraction domains of this joint problem and illustrate
   their importance and relevance for designing adaptive traffic control

   efficiency, temporal and energy spreads, and effects of laser-pulse

Abstract = {{The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used in
   solving structured convex optimization problems. Despite its success in
   practice, the convergence of the standard ADMM for minimizing the sum of
   N (N >= 3) convex functions, whose variables are linked by linear
   constraints, has remained unclear for a very long time. Recently, Chen
   et al. (Math Program, doi: 10.1007/s10107-014-0826-5, 2014) provided a
   counter-example showing that the ADMM for N >= 3 may fail to converge
   without further conditions. Since the ADMM for N >= 3 has been very
   successful when applied to many problems arising from real practice, it
   is worth further investigating under what kind of sufficient conditions
   it can be guaranteed to converge. In this paper, we present such
   sufficient conditions that can guarantee the sublinear convergence rate
   for the ADMM for N >= 3. Specifically, we show that if one of the
   functions is convex (not necessarily strongly convex) and the other N-1
   functions are strongly convex, and the penalty parameter lies in a
   certain region, the ADMM converges with rate O(1/t) in a certain ergodic
   sense and o(1/t) in a certain non-ergodic sense, where t denotes the
   number of iterations. As a by-product, we also provide a simple proof
   for the O(1/t) convergence rate of two-block ADMM in terms of both
   objective error and constraint violation, without assuming any condition
   on the penalty parameter and strong convexity on the functions.}},

Abstract = {{Phase change thermotropic materials have been proposed as a low cost
   method to provide passive overheat protection for polymer solar thermal
   absorbers. One challenge to their development is control of the size of
   the phase change particles dispersed within the matrix. Here we explore
   encapsulation as a means to resolve this challenge with a focus on the
   selection of materials, including the encapsulating shell, to achieve
   desirable optical behavior. Hydroxystearic acid (HSA) particles in a
   matrix of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is down selected from
   candidate materials based on its optical properties and the melt
   temperature of the dispersed phase. The optical properties
   (normal-hemispherical transmittance, reflectance, and absorptance) as a
   function of the properties of the encapsulation shell and the particle
   volume fraction are predicted at a wavelength of 589 nm using a Monte
   Carlo ray tracing model. A range of shell relative refractive indices,
   from 0.95 to 1, and thicknesses, up to 35 nm, can be employed to achieve

Abstract = {{To create functional tissues having complex structures, bottom-up
   approaches to assembling small tissue modules into larger constructs
   have been emerging. Most of these approaches are based on chemical
   reactions or physical interactions at the interface between tissue
   modules. Here we report a biological assembly approach to integrate
   small tissue modules through endothelial capillary network formation.
   When adjacent tissue modules contain appropriate extracellular matrix
   materials and cell types that support robust endothelial capillary
   network formation, capillary tubules form and grow across the interface,
   resulting in assembly of the modules into a single, larger construct. It
   was shown that capillary networks formed in modules of dense fibrin gels
   seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and
   mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs); adjacent modules were firmly assembled
   into an integrated construct having a strain to failure of 117 +/- 26\%,
   a tensile strength of 2208 +/- 83 Pa and a Young's modulus of 2548 +/-
   574 Pa. Under the same culture conditions, capillary networks were
   absent in modules of dense fibrin gels seeded with either HUVECs or MSCs
   alone; adjacent modules disconnected even when handled gently. This
   biological assembly approach eliminates the need for chemical reactions
   or physical interactions and their associated limitations. In addition,
   the integrated constructs are prevascularized, and therefore this
   bottom-up assembly approach may also help address the issue of
   vascularization, another key challenge in tissue engineering. Copyright

Title = {{A Self-Aligned Strategy for Printed Electronics: Exploiting Capillary
   Flow on Microstructured Plastic Surfaces}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Printing is a promising route for high-throughput processing of
   electronic devices on large-area, flexible substrates by virtue of its
   integration into roll-to-roll production formats. However, multilayered
   electronic devices require materials registration with micrometer-level
   tolerances, which is a serious challenge for continuous manufacturing.
   Here, a novel, self-aligned manufacturing approach is introduced that
   allows precision patterning of multilayered electronic devices by inkjet
   printing on microimprinted plastic substrates. Materials registration is
   achieved automatically by sequential deposition of liquid inks into
   multilevel trench networks on the substrate surface using capillary
   forces. By creating suitable multitier capillary networks, fully
   self-aligned fabrication of all the major building blocks of an
   integrated circuit, including resistors, capacitors, transistors, and
   crossovers, with excellent yields and performance metrics is
   demonstrated. The current status of inkjet and imprint technologies
   suggests that this self-aligned manufacturing strategy can be scaled up
   to large-area substrates with integration densities greater than 1000
   devices cm(-2).}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Breast cancer is a leading cause of death for women, with mortality
   resulting from metastasis. Metastases are often detected once tumour
   cells affect the function of solid organs, with a high disease burden
   limiting effective treatment. Here we report a method for the early
   detection of metastasis using an implanted scaffold to recruit and
   capture metastatic cells in vivo, which achieves high cell densities and
   reduces the tumour burden within solid organs 10-fold. Recruitment is
   associated with infiltration of immune cells, which include
   Gr1(hi)CD11b(+) cells. We identify metastatic cells in the scaffold
   through a label-free detection system using inverse spectroscopic
   optical coherence tomography, which identifies changes to nanoscale
   tissue architecture associated with the presence of tumour cells. For
   patients at risk of recurrence, scaffold implantation following
   completion of primary therapy has the potential to identify metastatic
   disease at the earliest stage, enabling initiation of therapy while the
   disease burden is low.}},

Title = {{Are cellular phone blocking applications effective for novice teen
   drivers?}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{54}},
Pages = {{75-82}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Problem: Distracted driving is a significant concern for novice teen
   drivers. Although cellular phone bans are applied in many jurisdictions
   to restrict cellular phone use, teen drivers often report making calls
   and texts while driving. Method: The Minnesota Teen Driver Study
   incorporated cellular phone blocking functions via a software
   application for 182 novice teen drivers in two treatment conditions. The
   first condition included 92 teens who ran a driver support application
   on a smartphone that also blocked phone usage. The second condition
   included 90 teens who ran the same application with phone blocking but
   which also reported back to parents about monitored risky behaviors
   (e.g., speeding). A third control group consisting of 92 novice teen
   drivers had the application and phone-based software installed on the
   phones to record cellular phone (but not block it) use while driving.
   Results: The two treatment groups made significantly fewer calls and
   texts per mile driven compared to the control group. The control group
   data also demonstrated a higher propensity to text while driving rather
   than making calls. Discussion: Software that blocks cellular phone use
   (except 911) while driving can be effective at mitigating calling and
   texting for novice teen drivers. However, subjective data indicates that
   some teens were motivated to find ways around the software, as well as
   to use another teen's phone while driving when they were unable to use
   theirs. Practical applications: Cellular phone bans for calling and
   texting are the first step to changing behaviors associated with texting
   and driving, particularly among novice teen drivers. Blocking software
   has the additional potential to reduce impulsive calling and texting
   while driving among novice teen drivers who might logically know the
   risks, but for whom it is difficult to ignore calling or texting while
   driving. (C) 2015 National Safety Council and Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Decisions involve two fundamental problems, selecting goals and
   generating actions to pursue those goals. While simple decisions involve
   choosing a goal and pursuing it, humans evolved to survive in hostile
   dynamic environments where goal availability and value can change with
   time and previous actions, entangling goal decisions with action
   selection. Recent studies suggest the brain generates concurrent
   action-plans for competing goals, using online information to bias the
   competition until a single goal is pursued. This creates a challenging
   problem of integrating information across diverse types, including both
   the dynamic value of the goal and the costs of action. We model the
   computations underlying dynamic decision-making with disparate value
   types, using the probability of getting the highest pay-off with the
   least effort as a common currency that supports goal competition. This
   framework predicts many aspects of decision behavior that have eluded a
   common explanation.}},

Title = {{An Evolutionary Approach for Identifying Driver Mutations in Colorectal
   Cancer}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The traditional view of cancer as a genetic disease that can
   successfully be treated with drugs targeting mutant onco-proteins has
   motivated whole-genome sequencing efforts in many human cancer types.
   However, only a subset of mutations found within the genomic landscape
   of cancer is likely to provide a fitness advantage to the cell.
   Distinguishing such ``driver{''} mutations from innocuous
   ``passenger{''} events is critical for prioritizing the validation of
   candidate mutations in disease-relevant models. We design a novel
   statistical index, called the Hitchhiking Index, which reflects the
   probability that any observed candidate gene is a passenger alteration,
   given the frequency of alterations in a cross-sectional cancer sample
   set, and apply it to a mutational data set in colorectal cancer. Our
   methodology is based upon a population dynamics model of mutation
   accumulation and selection in colorectal tissue prior to cancer
   initiation as well as during tumorigenesis. This methodology can be used
   to aid in the prioritization of candidate mutations for functional
   validation and contributes to the process of drug discovery.}},

Title = {{Multiscale Mechanical Model of the Pacinian Corpuscle Shows Depth and

   Indentation}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Cutaneous mechanoreceptors transduce different tactile stimuli into
   neural signals that produce distinct sensations of touch. The Pacinian
   corpuscle (PC), a cutaneous mechanoreceptor located deep within the
   dermis of the skin, detects high frequency vibrations that occur within
   its large receptive field. The PC is comprised of lamellae that surround
   the nerve fiber at its core. We hypothesized that a layered, anisotropic
   structure, embedded deep within the skin, would produce the nonlinear
   strain transmission and low spatial sensitivity characteristic of the
   PC. A multiscale finite-element model was used to model the equilibrium
   response of the PC to indentation. The first simulation considered an
   isolated PC with fiber networks aligned with the PC's surface. The PC
   was subjected to a 10 mu m indentation by a 250 mu m diameter indenter.
   The multiscale model captured the nonlinear strain transmission through
   the PC, predicting decreased compressive strain with proximity to the
   receptor's core, as seen experimentally by others. The second set of
   simulations considered a single PC embedded epidermally (shallow) or
   dermally (deep) to model the PC's location within the skin. The embedded
   models were subjected to 10 mu m indentations at a series of locations
   on the surface of the skin. Strain along the long axis of the PC was
   calculated after indentation to simulate stretch along the nerve fiber
   at the center of the PC. Receptive fields for the epidermis and dermis
   models were constructed by mapping the long-axis strain after
   indentation at each point on the surface of the skin mesh. The dermis
   model resulted in a larger receptive field, as the calculated strain
   showed less indenter location dependence than in the epidermis model.}},

Abstract = {{Today, the Mohs scale is used profusely throughout educational systems
   without any persuasive understanding of the fundamental principles. Why
   one mineral has a scratch hardness over the next culminating in a scale
   of 1 (chalk) to 10 (diamond) has no atomistic or structure-sensitive
   basis that explains this outcome. With modern computationally based
   atomistic and multiscale models, there is increasing promise of defining
   the pressure and rate-dependent parameters that will allow a fundamental
   understanding of the Mohs scale. This study principally addresses the
   combined fracture and plasticity parameters that qualitatively affect
   fracture at the nanoscale. A physical model wherein the crack tip under
   a scratch is shielded by dislocations is supported by molecular dynamics
   (MD) simulations in both ductile aluminum and brittle silicon carbide.
   Next, this model is applied to nanoindentation data from the literature
   to produce a ranking of Mohs minerals based on their fundamental
   properties. As such, what is presented here is a first step to address
   the flow and fracture parameters ultimately required to provide a figure
   of merit for scratch hardness and thus the Mohs scale.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider a cellular/infostation integrated network
   that supports on-demand data service delivery over a wireless link to
   users in a high-speed train. For the requests with different lifetimes
   and prices that they are willing to pay, we develop the optimal packet
   schedule that aims at earning the maximum revenue. To this end, we
   formulate the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). The problem
   cannot be solved efficiently by existing ILP solvers with guaranteed
   polynomial-time complexity in the worst case. By exploring the special
   structure of the formulated ILP, we propose a novel Checker algorithm
   and prove that this algorithm is guaranteed to find the offline optimal
   schedule in polynomial time. Based on the relevant insights, we further
   develop a class of online Checker algorithms that require only causal
   knowledge of service demands and wireless channel capacities. It is
   established that these online algorithms have a worstcase competitive
   ratio of 1/2, i.e., total revenue earned by them is at least half as
   much as the revenue earned by an offline optimal schedule that knows the
   complete a priori knowledge of future requests and channel conditions.
   Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the merit of the proposed
   algorithms.}},

Title = {{The Efficacy of Ankle-Foot Orthoses on Improving the Gait of Children
   With Diplegic Cerebral Palsy: A Multiple Outcome Analysis}},
Journal = {{PM\&R}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{922-929}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) prescriptions are common for
   patients diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP). Typical treatment
   objectives are to improve ankle-foot function and enhance general gait
   quality.
   Objective: To determine the effectiveness of AFOs for improving the gait
   of children with diplegic CP.
   Design: Retrospective analysis.
   Setting: Primary clinical care facility.
   Participants: Data were used from 601 visits for 378 individuals (age at
   visit: 9.8 +/- 3.8 years {[}mean +/- standard deviation]) who wore
   either a solid, hinged, or posterior leaf spring AFO design.
   Participants had a diagnosis of diplegic CP, wore the same AFO design
   bilaterally, and had 3-dimensional gait analysis data collected while
   walking both barefoot and with AFOs during a single session.
   Methods: Differences between walking with AFOs and walking barefoot were
   used as outcome measures. Statistical analysis consisted of paired
   t-tests and multivariate analysis of variance scores to determine
   significance, main effects, and interactions of AFO design, ambulation
   type (walking with/without assistive devices), and barefoot level on
   each outcome. Minimal clinically important differences from the
   literature determined clinical significance.
   Outcome Measures: Gait Deviation Index (GDI), ankle Gait Variable Score,
   knee Gait Variable Score, nondimensional speed, and nondimensional step
   length.
   Results: Only step length exhibited clinically meaningful improvements
   for the average AFO user. Changes in step length, speed, and GDI all
   were statistically significant (P < .001). Barefoot outcome levels were
   the most consistent influence on outcome changes. AFO design was shown
   to effect changes in speed and ankle function, whereas ambulation type
   was shown to affect GDI change.
   Conclusions: Current AFO prescription methodologies for children with CP
   result in consistent gait improvements for step length only. This study
   emphasizes the need to develop more effective AFO prescription
   algorithms in an effort to improve the efficacy of AFOs on general gait
   quality via optimizing patient selection or AFO design.}},

Abstract = {{A series of poly(cyclohexylethylene)-block-poly-(ethylene oxide) (CEO)
   diblock copolymers were synthesized through tandem anionic

   Solvent-annealed CEO diblock films were used to template dense arrays of

   precursor solution atop the ordered film. The substantial chemical
   dissimilarity of the two blocks enables (i) selective inclusion of the
   inorganic precursor within the PEO domain and (ii) the formation of
   exceptionally small feature sizes due to a relatively large interaction
   parameter estimated from mean-field analysis of the order disorder
   transition temperatures of compositionally symmetric samples. UV/ozone
   treatment following incorporation produces an ordered arrangement of
   oxide nanodots and simultaneously removes the block polymer template.

Abstract = {{Block polymers incorporating highly incompatible segments are termed
   ``high chi{''} polymers, where chi is the Flory-Huggins interaction
   parameter. These materials have attracted a great deal of interest
   because low molar mass versions allow for the formation of
   rnicrophase-separated domains with very small (<10 nm) feature sizes
   useful for nanopatterning at these extreme dimensions. Given that
   well-established photolithographic techniques now face difficult
   challenges of implementation at scales of 10 nm and below, the drive to
   further develop high chi block polymers is motivated by trends in the
   microelectronics industry. This Viewpoint highlights our perspective on
   this niche of block polymer self-assembly. We first briefly review the
   relevant recent literature, exploring the various block polymer
   compositions that have been specifically designed for small feature size
   patterning. We then overview the now standard method for the
   benchmarking chi values between different pairs of polymers and the
   consequences of low N and high chi on the thermodynamic aspects of
   microphase separation. Finally, we comment on restrictions going forward
   and offer our perspective on the future of this exciting area of block
   polymer self-assembly.}},

Volume = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Chirality is an important molecular property for structural analysis.
   Similarly, it has been shown that plasmonic chiral systems exhibit
   strong circular dichroism (CD) responses that can be used to determine
   the relative positions of their constituent plasmonic elements. Here we
   show that the sign of the circular dichroism spectrum in a plasmonic
   system can be controllably changed through small geometric perturbations
   that change the energetic ordering of the hybridized modes. This
   mechanism is distinct from geometrical changes that explicitly change
   the handedness of the system. In a simple system composed of two stacked
   L-shaped resonators we observe a reversal of the optical rotation
   spectral signature for small relative shifts, and we show through
   electromagnetic modeling and experiments on lithographically patterned
   samples that this is due to a rearrangement of the relative energies
   between modes. The plasmonic system allows for geometric perturbation
   along controlled directions and therefore offers more control than
   corresponding molecular examples. Interestingly, this strong sensitivity
   in the optical response encodes more spatial information into the
   optical spectrum, emphasizing the importance of chiral plasmonic
   assemblies for structural investigations on the nanoscale.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTER JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{9}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a deMOtion-based, fLash-awARe hybrid storage cache
   model, named MOLAR, to effectively integrate Flash-based Solid-State
   Disks (SSDs) into traditional dynamic random access memory (DRAM)-based
   memory storage systems where SSDs serve as the Tier-2 cache, while DRAM
   is considered as the Tier-1 cache. We found that conventional cache
   algorithms designed for DRAM perform poorly in SSDs due to the limited
   write cycles and asymmetric read/write performance of Flash memory. In
   MOLAR, a Flash-aware I/O path structure is designed to adapt the
   asymmetric read and write performance of SSDs and, moreover, to reduce
   useless write operations. A new control metric, demotion count, is
   validated to wisely select the evicted blocks from DRAM to reside in the
   SSD. Besides, for SSD can improve internal data placement from data
   access hints, the Logical Block Addresses in the SSD are grouped into
   the long-lived region and the short-lived region self-adaptively via a
   heuristic control algorithm based on the change of the block demotion
   count. Through trace-driven simulations, the overall hit ratio in MOLAR
   outperforms two traditional policies by 1.44-5.34\%. The average access
   latency in SSDs is reduced by 3.5x to 4.5x. Moreover, write
   amplification is effectively reduced by similar to 36\% in two typical
   Flash address-mapping policies.}},

Abstract = {{In content-centric networks, it is challenging how to optimally
   provision in-network storage to cache contents, to balance the tradeoffs
   between the network performance and the provisioning cost. To address
   this problem, we first propose a holistic model for intradomain networks
   to characterize the network performance of routing contents to clients
   and the network cost incurred by globally coordinating the in-network
   storage capability. We then derive the optimal strategy for provisioning
   the storage capability that optimizes the overall network performance
   and cost, and analyze the performance gains via numerical evaluations on
   real network topologies. Our results reveal interesting phenomena; for
   instance, different ranges of the Zipf exponent can lead to opposite
   optimal strategies, and the tradeoffs between the network performance
   and the provisioning cost have great impacts on the stability of the
   optimal strategy. We also demonstrate that the optimal strategy can
   achieve significant gain on both the load reduction at origin servers
   and the improvement on the routing performance. Moreover, given an
   optimal coordination level l{*}, we design a routing-aware content
   placement (RACP) algorithm that runs on a centralized server. The
   algorithm computes and assigns contents to each CCN router to store,
   which can minimize the overall routing cost, e.g., transmission delay or
   hop counts, to deliver contents to clients. By conducting extensive
   simulations using a large-scale trace dataset collected from a
   commercial 3G network in China, our results demonstrate that our caching
   scheme can achieve 4\% to 22\% latency reduction on average over the
   state-of-the-art caching mechanisms.}},

   diffusion-free MFI samples}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{329}},
Pages = {{218-228}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Self-pillared pentasil MFI (similar to 1 nm diffusion length) exhibited
   low ethene selectivity (1.1\%) at <100\% conversion for the catalytic
   reaction of dimethyl ether (DME) at 723 K and similar to 60 kPa DME
   pressure suggesting that the aromatics-based catalytic cycle is
   intrinsically suppressed in the pores of MFI under these reaction
   conditions. Co-feeding toluene or p-xylene with DME increased the number
   of chain carriers of the aromatics-based cycle, thereby enhancing its
   propagation and resulting in a 2-3-fold increase in ethene selectivity.
   Co-feeding propene or 1-hexene, however, did not have an effect on the
   product distribution, suggesting that the olefins-based hydrocarbon pool
   is saturated in the pores of MFI. At high temperature (723K) and low DME
   space velocity (<= 2.5 mol C {[}mol Al-s](-1)), conditions resulting in
   complete DME/methanol conversion, the catalyst bed comprises two stages:
   The first stage performs methanol-to-hydrocarbons chemistry in the
   presence of DME/methanol; the second stage begins after 100\% DME
   conversion is achieved and is characterized by the absence of
   DME/methanol. The aromatics-based methylation/cracking cycle is absent
   in the second stage as methylbenzenes cannot dealkylate in the absence
   of DME/methanol, and the dominant pathway to ethene formation under
   these reaction conditions is olefin inter-conversion. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Plasmonic structures can provide deep-subwavelength electromagnetic
   fields that are useful for enhancing light-matter interactions. However,
   because these localized modes are also dissipative, structures that
   offer the best compromise between field confinement and loss have been
   sought. Metallic wedge waveguides were initially identified as an ideal
   candidate but have been largely abandoned because to date their
   experimental performance has been limited. We combine state-of-the-art
   metallic wedges with integrated reflectors and precisely placed
   colloidal quantum dots (down to the single-emitter level) and
   demonstrate quantum-plasmonic waveguides and resonators with performance
   approaching theoretical limits. By exploiting a nearly 10-fold
   improvement in wedge-plasmon propagation (19 mu m at a vacuum
   wavelength, lambda(vac), of 630 nm), efficient reflectors (93\%), and
   effective coupling (estimated to be >70\%) to highly emissive (similar
   to 90\%) quantum dots, we obtain Ag plasmonic resonators at visible
   wavelengths with quality factors approaching 200 (3.3 nm line widths).
   As our structures offer modal volumes down to similar to 0.004
   lambda(3)(vac) in an exposed single-mode waveguide-resonator geometry,
   they provide advantages over both traditional photonic microcavities and
   localized-plasmonic resonators for enhancing light-matter interactions.
   Our results confirm the promise of wedges for creating plasmonic devices
   and for studying coherent quantum-plasmonic effects such as
   long-distance plasmon-mediated entanglement and strong plasmon matter
   coupling.}},

Abstract = {{Supply logistics systems for corn (Zea mays L.) stover and switchgrass
   (Panicum virgatum L.) with two collection methods, round bales and
   rectangular bales, are developed. A location in the US Midwest is
   assumed with corn grown on highly productive crop land and switchgrass
   grown on less productive land. Bales (15 \% moisture wet basis) are
   stored at local storage sites within 3.2 km (2 mi) of the field at
   harvest time. Biomass is transported to an end user within a 48 km (30
   mi) throughout the year. Round bales are converted to bulk product
   {[}bulk density of 240 kg m(-3) (15 lb ft(-3))] by tub grinding followed
   by roll-press compacting before truck transport. Rectangular bales are
   delivered by truck without processing. Total delivered cost is \$97.70
   Mg-1 (\$88.63 ton(-1)) for corn stover and \$137.87 Mg-1 (\$125.07
   ton(-1)) for switchgrass when delivered as a bulk compacted product.
   Total delivered cost is \$90.25 Mg-1 (\$81.87 ton(-1)) for corn stover
   and \$128.67 Mg-1 (\$116.73 ton(-1)) for switchgrass when delivered as
   rectangular bales. Life-cycle fossil energy consumption is higher for
   delivering switchgrass (9.9 to 13.8 \% of energy in dry matter) than for
   corn stover (5.8 to 9.5 \% of energy in dry matter). Excluding any
   potential change in soil organic carbon (SOC), life-cycle greenhouse gas
   (GHG) emissions are 59.2 to 99.8 kg CO(2)e Mg-1 for delivering corn
   stover and 231.8 to 279.6 kg CO(2)e Mg-1 for delivering switchgrass. The
   effect of change in SOC on the life-cycle GHG emissions for corn stover
   and switchgrass is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Metastasis is the leading cause of death in patients with osteosarcoma,
   the most common pediatric bone malignancy. We conducted a multistage
   genome-wide association study of osteosarcoma metastasis at diagnosis in
   935 osteosarcoma patients to determine whether germline genetic
   variation contributes to risk of metastasis. We identified an SNP,
   rs7034162, in NFIB significantly associated with metastasis in European
   osteosarcoma cases, as well as in cases of African and Brazilian
   ancestry (meta-analysis of all cases: P = 1.2 x 10(-9); OR, 2.43; 95\%
   confidence interval, 1.83-3.24). The risk allele was significantly
   associated with lowered NFIB expression, which led to increased
   osteosarcoma cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation. In
   addition, a transposon screen in mice identified a significant
   proportion of osteosarcomas harboring inactivating insertions in Nfib
   and with lowered NFIB expression. These data suggest that germline
   genetic variation at rs7034162 is important in osteosarcoma metastasis
   and that NFIB is an osteosarcoma metastasis susceptibility gene.
   SIGNIFICANCE: Metastasis at diagnosis in osteosarcoma is the leading
   cause of death in these patients. Here we show data that are supportive
   for the NFIB locus as associated with metastatic potential in
   osteosarcoma. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical absorption was employed for the harmless treatment of sulfuryl
   fluoride (SO2F2) in the simulated residual fumigant. SO2F2 was absorbed
   by sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution in a packed column. Effects of spray
   density, gas flow rate, concentration of NaOH solution, and inlet SO2F2
   volume concentration on SO2F2 removal efficiency were investigated at
   room temperature. It was found that SO2F2 could be removed completely
   when inlet SO2F2 volume concentration, spray density, gas flow rate, and
   NaOH concentration were 0.50\%, 12m(3)/(m(2)h), 0.12m(3)/h, and
   0.68mol/L, respectively. According to the two-film theory, a
   mathematical model based on Onda correlations was developed to describe
   the removal efficiency of SO2F2. Comparison between the experimental
   data and the calculated data proved that the predictability of the
   proposed model was within the maximum deviation of 8.0\%. Aqueous NaOH
   solution after absorption was analyzed. It was found that the SO2F2 was
   fixed and converted to NaF, NaSO3F, and Na2SO4.}},

Abstract = {{Sag is a coating defect that results from excessive, gravity-driven flow
   after deposition. Accordingly, characterizing resistance to sag is
   critically important. In this paper, sag resistance predicted using a
   multinotched applicator test is compared with results obtained using an
   in situ particle tracking technique that measures surface velocity. Four
   commercial latex paints dried on substrates inclined at three angles
   were investigated. The results are used to provide insight into the
   strengths and limitations of using a multinotched applicator to evaluate
   sag resistance. For coatings dried on vertical surfaces (90A degrees),
   the suggested condition for the multinotched applicator, sag lengths
   found by particle tracking show differences between paints that the
   multinotched applicator ranked as identical. At smaller angles (e.g.,
   10A degrees), the resolution of the multinotched applicator test is
   greatly enhanced owing to a reduction in the shear stress difference
   between adjacent coated lines. Based on these results, specific
   recommendations are made for successfully employing a multinotched
   applicator to evaluate sag resistance based on user-specific goals.}},

Abstract = {{Multilayer continuous liquid coating is the most efficient way to
   manufacture films that require more than one layer for optimal
   performance. Two-layer slot coating is one of the different coating
   methods largely used to deposit two thin, uniform liquid layers onto a
   moving substrate. In recent years, the operating conditions and solution
   properties which are required to avoid various coating defects have been
   discussed in the literature. However, these past studies have not
   focused on the problem of top layer dewetting, which may occur at some
   operating conditions. It is important to include in the operating window
   of the process, the region of the parameter space at which the top layer
   dewetting is avoided. In this work, we used water-based and
   alcohol-based solutions to create two-layer films over a moving
   substrate using a two-layer slot coating die. The critical operating
   condition at which top layer dewetting is observed is determined
   experimentally for different liquid viscosities, surface tensions, and
   wet thicknesses. A physical mechanism that explains the reported
   phenomenon is proposed. The results show how dewetting can be avoided by
   controlling the liquid properties (surface tension and viscosity) and
   wet thickness of each layer and will certainly help the design of
   two-layer slot coating processes.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) printing or additive manufacturing is an emerging
   technology that enables the exploration of new ideas and designs. The
   process converts a 3D digital model into a 3D object, allowing end users
   to hold and easily visualize their designs. Since 3D printed parts are
   built through layer-by-layer deposition, they exhibit limited surface
   smoothness and surface quality. By applying water-based coatings onto 3D
   printed parts, surface quality can be improved by reducing surface
   roughness and by sealing surface gaps without deforming the parts
   themselves. In this study, water-based coatings were applied to 3D
   printed parts using a computer-controlled dip coater. Surface profiles
   of 3D printed parts before and after dip coating were measured using a
   profilometer and parts were examined with optical microscopy. Two
   commercial water-based coating systems were evaluated, and the effect of
   coating speed, drying conditions, and number of coated layers on surface
   roughness of 3D printed parts was studied. The effect of printing with
   different print tips and in different orientations on surface roughness
   before and after coating was also studied. Coating liquids with higher
   solids loading were found to be most effective at smoothing or
   planarizing the 3D printed part surface.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo develop high-resolution electrical properties tomography (EPT)
   methods and investigate a gradient-based EPT (gEPT) approach that aims
   to reconstruct the electrical properties (EP), including conductivity
   and permittivity, of an imaged sample from experimentally measured B-1
   maps with improved boundary reconstruction and robustness against
   measurement noise.
   Theory and MethodsUsing a multichannel transmit/receive stripline head
   coil with acquired B-1 maps for each coil element, and by assuming
   negligible B-z component compared to transverse B-1 components, a theory
   describing the relationship between B-1 field, EP value, and their
   spatial gradient has been proposed. The final EP images were obtained
   through spatial integration over the reconstructed EP gradient.
   Numerical simulation, physical phantom, and in vivo human experiments at
   7 T have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method.
   ResultsReconstruction results were compared with target EP values in
   both simulations and phantom experiments. Human experimental results
   were compared with EP values in literature. Satisfactory agreement was
   observed with improved boundary reconstruction. Importantly, the
   proposed gEPT method proved to be more robust against noise when
   compared to previously described nongradient-based EPT approaches.
   ConclusionThe proposed gEPT approach holds promises to improve EP
   mapping quality by recovering the boundary information and enhancing
   robustness against noise. Magn Reson Med 74:634-646, 2015. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Although cancer cell fusion has been suggested as a mechanism of cancer
   metastasis, the underlying mechanisms defining this process are poorly
   understood. In a recent study, apoptotic cells were newly identified as
   a type of cue that induces signaling via phosphatidylserine receptors to
   promote fusion of myoblasts. The microenvironment of breast tumors is
   often hypoxic, and because apoptosis is greatly increased in hypoxic
   conditions, we decided to investigate whether the mechanism of breast
   cancer cell fusion with mesenchymal stem/multipotent stromal cells
   (MSCs) involves apoptosis. We used a powerful tool for identification
   and tracking of hybrids based on bimolecular fluorescence
   complementation (BiFC) and found that breast cancer cells fused
   spontaneously with MSCs. This fusion was significantly enhanced with
   hypoxia and signaling associated with apoptotic cells, especially
   between nonmetastatic breast cancer cells and MSCs. In addition, the
   hybrids showed a significantly higher migratory capacity than did the
   parent cells. Taken together, these findings describe a mechanism by
   which hypoxia-induced apoptosis stimulates fusion between MSCs and
   breast tumor cells resulting in hybrids with an enhanced migratory
   capacity that may enable their dissemination to distant sites or
   metastases. In the long run, this study may provide new strategies for
   developing novel drugs for preventing cancer metastasis.}},

Title = {{Initial white rot type dominance of wood decomposition and its

Abstract = {{Efforts to model woody debris dynamics are limited by our empirical
   understanding of the patterns and drivers of decomposition. This
   knowledge gap is significant in tropical forests, particularly in the
   dry tropics where research has been minimal and where forest
   regeneration is a management priority. Here, we coupled trait-function
   relationships in decomposing logs with indices of microbial and insect
   activity in a regenerating Costa Rican dry forest. We cut and placed
   logs (similar to 18 cm dia) of eight tree species in ground contact at
   two sites. We assessed density loss and element dynamics in sapwood and
   heartwood twice annually over two years. At time 0 and year 2, we
   measured lignin, nitrogen, structural carbohydrates, extractives, insect
   galleries, and two residue `signatures' of fungal rot type: dilute
   alkali solubility (DAS; higher for brown rot) and lignin:glucan loss
   (higher for white rot). After two years, sapwood mean density losses
   ranged from 11.6 to 44.4\% among tree species (excluding one
   thoroughly-degraded species). The best predictor of sapwood density loss
   was initial pH, but this correlation was negative, contrasting positive
   correlations proposed for temperate forests. Mean heartwood density
   losses were consistently less than those in sapwood, and although
   heartwood extractives contents were as high as 16.4\%, trait
   correlations were insignificant. Insect galleries contributed little to
   density loss (<3\%), and DAS and lignin loss patterns indicated
   dominance by white rot fungi. This was often matched by dense fungal
   zone line patterns (spalting), outlining many small territories. Perhaps
   as a consequence, element patterns were spatially variable, with overall
   trends roughly similar to those from temperate studies (e.g., Ca gain,
   P, K loss). Estimated CO2 fluxes from logs ranged from similar to 25 to
   75\% percent of annual fluxes from litter fall. This collectively
   implies an important role for wood decomposition in dry forest carbon
   cycling, and in our case, it shows an interesting pattern suggesting
   high decomposer spatial complexity but low functional diversity. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper considers a recently emerged hyperspectral unmixing
   formulation based on sparse regression of a self-dictionary multiple
   measurement vector (SD-MMV) model, wherein the measured hyperspectral
   pixels are used as the dictionary. Operating under the pure pixel
   assumption, this SD-MMV formalism is special in that it allows
   simultaneous identification of the endmember spectral signatures and the
   number of endmembers. Previous SD-MMV studies mainly focus on convex
   relaxations. In this study, we explore the alternative of greedy
   pursuit, which generally provides efficient and simple algorithms. In
   particular, we design a greedy SD-MMV algorithm using simultaneous
   orthogonal matching pursuit. Intriguingly, the proposed greedy algorithm
   is shown to be closely related to some existing pure pixel search
   algorithms, especially, the successive projection algorithm (SPA). Thus,
   a link between SD-MMV and pure pixel search is revealed. We then perform
   exact recovery analyses, and prove that the proposed greedy algorithm is
   robust to noise-including its identification of the (unknown) number of
   endmembers-under a sufficiently low noise level. The identification
   performance of the proposed greedy algorithm is demonstrated through
   both synthetic and real-data experiments.}},

Title = {{Effects of inertia and viscoelasticity on sedimenting anisotropic
   particles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{778}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{An axisymmetric particle sedimenting in an otherwise quiescent Newtonian
   fluid, in the Stokes regime, retains its initial orientation. For the
   special case of a spheroidal geometry, we examine analytically the
   effects of weak inertia and viscoelasticity in driving the particle
   towards an eventual steady orientation independent of initial
   conditions. The generalized reciprocal theorem, together with a novel
   vector spheroidal harmonics formalism, is used to find closed-form
   analytical expressions for the O(Re) inertial torque and the O(De)
   viscoelastic torque acting on a sedimenting spheroid of an arbitrary
   aspect ratio. Here, Re = UL/nu is the Reynolds number, with U being the
   sedimentation velocity, L the semi-major axis and nu the fluid kinematic
   viscosity, and is a measure of the inertial forces acting at the
   particle scale. The Deborah number, De = (lambda U)/L, is a
   dimensionless measure of the fluid viscoelasticity, with lambda being
   the intrinsic relaxation time of the underlying microstructure. The
   analysis is valid in the limit Re, De << 1, and the effects of
   viscoelasticity are therefore modelled using the constitutive equation
   of a second-order fluid. The inertial torque always acts to turn the
   spheroid broadside-on, while the final orientation due to the
   viscoelastic torque depends on the ratio of the magnitude of the first
   (N-1) to the second normal stress difference (N-2), and the sign
   (tensile or compressive) of N1. For the usual case of near-equilibrium
   complex fluids - a positive and dominant N-1 (N-1 > 0, N-2 < 0 and
   vertical bar N-1/N-2 vertical bar > 1) - both prolate and oblate
   spheroids adopt a longside-on orientation. The viscoelastic torque is
   found to be remarkably sensitive to variations in kappa in the
   slender-fibre limit (kappa >> 1), where kappa = L/b is the aspect ratio,
   b being the radius of the spheroid (semi-minor axis). The angular
   dependence of the inertial and viscoelastic torques turn out to be
   identical, and one may then characterize the long-time orientation of
   the sedimenting spheroid based solely on a critical value (El(c)) of the
   elasticity number, El = De/Re. For El < El(c) (> El(c)), inertia
   (viscoelasticity) prevails with the spheroid settling broadside-on
   (longside-on). The analysis shows that El(c) similar to O{[}(1/ln
   kappa)] for kappa >> 1, and the viscoelastic torque thus dominates for a
   slender rigid fibre. For a slender fibre alone, we also briefly analyse
   the effects of elasticity on fibre orientation outside the second-order
   fluid regime.}},

   representation for missing value estimation}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{210-223}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Missing values in real application can significantly disturb the result
   of knowledge discovery, and it is thus vital to estimate this unknown
   data accurately. This paper focuses on applying sparse representation to
   improve the quality of estimation of the absent values. Firstly, a novel
   sparse representation scheme called locality constrained sparse
   representation (LCSR) is presented, introducing locality l(1)-norm and
   l(2)-norm regularization. Taking the advantage of sparsity, smoothness
   and locality structure, LCSR is capable of automatically selecting
   instance and avoiding overfitting. Then LCSR-based missing value
   estimation (LCSR-MVE) is proposed to estimate the unobserved values
   through the linear combination of automatically selected atoms from
   dictionary due to the sparsity in reconstruction coefficient vector,
   while three dictionary constructions are also developed respectively.
   The proposed LCSR-MVE is evaluated on 6 datasets from UCI and gene
   expression databases, compared with other instance-based missing value
   estimation methods. Results show that the proposed LCSR-MVE outperforms
   other state-of-arts methods in terms of normalized root mean squared
   error (NRMSE), and is not much sensitive to the dictionary size and
   regularization parameters. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Transcriptional regulation of APOBEC3 antiviral immunity through the
   CBF-beta/RUNX axis}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A diverse set of innate immune mechanisms protects cells from viral
   infections. The APOBEC3 family of DNA cytosine deaminases is an integral
   part of these defenses. For instance, APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and
   APOBEC3H would have the potential to destroy HIV-1 complementary DNA
   replication intermediates if not for neutralization by a proteasomal
   degradation mechanism directed by the viral protein Vif. At the core of
   this complex, Vif heterodimerizes with the transcription cofactor
   CBF-beta, which results in fewer transcription complexes between
   CBF-beta and its normal RUNX partners. Recent studies have shown that
   the Vif/CBF-beta interaction is specific to the primate lentiviruses
   HIV-1 and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus), although related
   nonprimate lentiviruses still require a Vif-dependent mechanism for
   protection from host species' APOBEC3 enzymes. We provide a molecular
   explanation for this evolutionary conundrum by showing that CBF-beta is
   required for expression of the aforementioned HIV-1-restrictive APOBEC3
   gene repertoire. Knockdown and knockout studies demonstrate that
   CBF-beta is required for APOBEC3 mRNA expression in the nonpermissive T
   cell line H9 and in primary CD4(+) T lymphocytes. Complementation
   experiments using CBF-beta separation-of-function alleles show that the
   interaction with RUNX transcription factors is required for APOBEC3
   transcriptional regulation. Accordingly, the infectivity of
   Vif-deficient HIV-1 increases in cells lacking CBF-beta, demonstrating
   the importance of CBF-beta/RUNX-mediated transcription in establishing
   the APOBEC3 antiviral state. These findings demonstrate a major layer of
   APOBEC3 gene regulation in lymphocytes and suggest that primate
   lentiviruses evolved to hijack CBF-beta in order to simultaneously
   suppress this potent antiviral defense system at both transcriptional
   and posttranslational levels.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundChemotherapy is commonly used as myeloablative conditioning
   treatment to prepare patients for haematopoietic stem cell
   transplantation (HSCT). Chemotherapy leads to several side effects, with
   gastrointestinal (GI) mucositis being one of the most frequent. Current
   models of GI mucositis pathophysiology are generally silent on the role
   of the intestinal microbiome.
   AimTo identify functional mechanisms by which the intestinal microbiome
   may play a key role in the pathophysiology of GI mucositis, we applied
   high-throughput DNA-sequencing analysis to identify microbes and
   microbial functions that are modulated following chemotherapy.
   MethodsWe amplified and sequenced 16S rRNA genes from faecal samples
   before and after chemotherapy in 28 patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma
   who received the same myeloablative conditioning regimen and no other
   concomitant therapy such as antibiotics.
   ResultsWe found that faecal samples collected after chemotherapy
   exhibited significant decreases in abundances of Firmicutes (P=0.0002)
   and Actinobacteria (P=0.002) and significant increases in abundances of
   Proteobacteria (P= 0.0002) compared to samples collected before
   chemotherapy. Following chemotherapy, patients had reduced capacity for
   nucleotide metabolism (P=0.0001), energy metabolism (P=0.001),
   metabolism of cofactors and vitamins (P=0.006), and increased capacity
   for glycan metabolism (P= 0.0002), signal transduction (P=0.0002) and
   xenobiotics biodegradation (P=0.002).
   ConclusionsOur study identifies a severe compositional and functional
   imbalance in the gut microbial community associated with
   chemotherapy-induced GI mucositis. The functional pathways implicated in
   our analysis suggest potential directions for the development of
   intestinal microbiome-targeted interventions in cancer patients.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a near infrared (NIR) light-activated gene silencing method
   in undifferentiated human embryonic stem cell (hESC) using a plasmonic
   hollow gold nanoshell (HGN) as the siRNA carrier. Our modular
   biotin-streptavidin coupling strategy enables positively charged
   TAT-peptide to coat oligonucleotides-saturated nanoparticles as a stable
   colloid formation. TAT-peptide coated nanoparticles with dense siRNA
   loading show efficient penetration into a wide variety of hESC cell
   lines. The siRNA is freed from the nanoparticles and delivered to the
   cytosol by femtosecond pulses of NIR light with potentially exquisite
   spatial and temporal control. The effectiveness of this approach is
   shown by targeting GFP and Oct4 genes in undifferentiated hESC (H9). The
   accelerated expression of differentiation markers for all three germ
   layers resulting from Oct4 knockdown confirms that this method has no
   detectable adverse effects that limit the range of differentiation. This
   biocompatible and NIR laser-activated patterning method makes possible
   single cell resolution of siRNA delivery for diverse studies in stem

Abstract = {{Two common hole transporting materials,
   N,N'-di(1-naphthyl)-N,N'-diphenyl-(1,1'-biphenyl)-4,4'-diamine (NPD) and
   tris(4-carbazoyl-9-ylphenyl)amine (TCTA) are separated and purified
   using thermal gradient sublimation. Their sublimation rates are
   proportional to the tube diameter squared and inversely proportional to
   the distance from the source boat to the deposition region. The
   deposition of these materials exponentially decays with distance down
   the tube. A theory predicting these results is derived. This theory
   suggests that diffusion and surface capture are the dominant steps in
   this purification, not processes in the source boat. It provides a
   rationale for improving the separation between multiple components and
   suggests routes for producing larger quantities of these materials. (C)

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Sag is a coating phenomenon characterized by gravity-driven flow after
   deposition; excessive amounts of sag can lead to coating defects. In
   this work, a new method for evaluating and quantifying sag is
   investigated. The motion of micron-sized Lycopodium spores on an
   inclined coating surface is tracked during drying, and the resulting
   surface velocity data is used to determine sag length. This in situ
   particle tracking method is minimally invasive and permits real time
   measurements. Measured sag lengths and real time surface velocities in
   aqueous polyvinyl alcohol solution coatings compare well with a
   theoretical model. The model is also used to develop a predictive sag
   regime map, which anticipates the extent of sag given coating properties
   and process-specific parameters. This map also identifies viable
   processing windows and aids in intelligent coating design given specific
   process constraints. The predictions of the sag regime map are compared
   against experimental sag results from polyvinyl alcohol solution
   coatings as well as four commercial latex paints, revealing good
   agreement for coatings with Newtonian or `Newtonian-like' rheologies.

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{88-94}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Pediatric patients account for a small portion of the heart valve
   replacements performed, but a pediatric pulmonary valve replacement with
   growth potential remains an unmet clinical need. Herein we report the
   first tubular heart valve made from two decellularized, engineered
   tissue tubes attached with absorbable sutures, which can meet this need,
   in principle. Engineered tissue tubes were fabricated by allowing ovine
   dermal fibroblasts to replace a sacrificial fibrin gel with an aligned,
   cell-produced collagenous matrix, which was subsequently decellularized.
   Previously, these engineered tubes became extensively recellularized
   following implantation into the sheep femoral artery. Thus, a tubular
   valve made from these tubes may be amenable to recellularization and,
   ideally, somatic growth. The suture line pattern generated three
   equi-spaced leaflets in the inner tube, which collapsed inward when
   exposed to back pressure, per tubular valve design. Valve testing was
   performed in a pulse duplicator system equipped with a secondary flow
   loop to allow for root distention. All tissue-engineered valves
   exhibited full leaflet opening and closing, minimal regurgitation
   (<5\%), and low systolic pressure gradients (<2.5 mmHg) under pulmonary
   conditions. Valve performance was maintained under various trans-root
   pressure gradients and no tissue damage was evident after 2 million
   cycles of fatigue testing. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present work describes the procedures and results from the first
   temperature measurements in closed chamber detonations obtained using
   the thermoluminescence (TL) of particles specifically developed for
   temperature sensing. Li2B4O7:Ag,Cu (LBO), MgB4O7:Dy,Li (MBO) and
   CaSO4:Ce,Tb (CSO) were tested separately in a total of 12 independent
   detonations using a closed detonation chamber at the Naval Surface
   Warfare Center, Indian Head Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology
   Division (NSWC IHEODTD). Detonations were carried out using two
   different explosives: a high temperature plastic bonded explosive (HPBX)
   and a low temperature plastic bonded explosive (LPBX). The LPBX and HPBX
   charges produced temperatures experienced by the TL particles to be
   between similar to 550-670 K and similar to 700-780 K, respectively,
   depending on the shot. The measured temperatures were reproducible and
   typically higher than the thermocouple temperatures. These tests
   demonstrate the survivability of the TL materials and the ability to
   obtain temperature estimates in realistic conditions, indicating that TL
   may represent a reliable way of estimating the temperature experienced
   by free-flowing particles inside an opaque post-detonation fireball. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple and low cost fabrication method to derive

   controllable on its wetting ability (from ultrahydrophobic to
   ultra-hydrophilic) and electrical properties, even after synthesis
   processes. Significant improvement of the performances of biosensors
   based on the new graphene composites was observed. The heat shrink
   enhances the output signal of the biosensor, and the sensitivity of the
   sensor grows with the TiO2 nanoparticles. Biosensor based on the new
   graphene composites is able to detect different types of lung cancer
   biomarkers with superb detection limit and specificity. (C) 2015

   10(-3) Omega.cm, a mass density that varies with thickness from 0.12 to
   0.54 g/cm(3), and a Young's modulus between 4.72 and 5.67 GPa. The
   latter was found to be independent of thickness from 77 to 134 nm. We

Abstract = {{In order to further improve the performance of organic photovoltaic
   cells (OPVs), it is essential to better understand the factors that
   limit the open-circuit voltage (V-oc). Previous work has sought to
   correlate the value of V-oc in donor acceptor (D-A) OPVs to the
   interface energy level offset (E-DA). In this work, measurements of
   electroluminescence are used to extract the charge transfer (CT) state
   energy for multiple small molecule D-A pairings. The CT state as
   measured from electroluminescence is found to show better correlation to
   the maximum V-oc than EDA. The difference between E-DA and the CT state
   energy is attributed to the Coulombic binding energy of the CT state.
   This correlation is demonstrated explicitly by inserting an insulating
   spacer layer between the donor and acceptor materials, reducing the
   binding energy of the CT state and increasing the measured V-oc. These
   results demonstrate a direct correlation between maximum V-oc and CT
   state energy.}},

   (TFs) and DNA has been generated, but these interactions often do not
   have apparent regulatory consequences. Therefore, equating physical
   interaction data with gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is problematic.
   Here, we comprehensively assay TF activity, rather than binding, to
   construct a network of gene regulatory interactions in the C. elegans
   intestine. Bymanually observing the in vivo tissue-specific knockdown of
   921 TFs on a panel of fluorescent transcriptional reporters, we
   identified a GRN of 411 interactions between 19 promoters and 177 TFs.
   This GRN shows only a modest overlap with physical interactions,
   indicating that many regulatory interactions are indirect. We applied
   nested effects modeling to uncover the information flow between TFs in
   the intestine that converges on a small set of physical TF-promoter
   interactions. We found numerous cell non-autonomous regulatory
   interactions, illustrating tissue-to-tissue communication. Our study
   illuminates the complexity of gene regulation in the context of a living
   animal.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a functional soft material that can spontaneously repair
   damage by straightforward application of light illumination. The
   composite material is composed of a common ionic liquid (IL),
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ({[}C(4)mim]PF6), and a
   well-defined ABA triblock copolymer consisting of the IL-compatible
   poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) middle block with thermo- and photosensitive
   random copolymers combining N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) and
   4-phenylazophenyl methacrylate (AzoMA) including azobenzene chromophore
   as terminal A blocks. The composite shows a sol-gel transition under UV
   light (366 nm, 8 mW cm(-2)) irradiation at 47 degrees C, whereas that
   observed under visible light (437 nm, 4 mW cm-2) is 55 degrees C, due to
   the difference in photochromic states of the azobenzene unit. The ABA
   triblock copolymer undergoes a reversible gel-sol-gel transition cycle
   at the bistable temperature (53 degrees C), with a reversible
   association/fragmentation of the polymer network resulting from the
   photoinduced self-assembly of the ABA triblock copolymer in
   {[}C4mim]PF6. A damaged ABA ion gel shows a remarkable photohealing
   ability based on drastic changes in the fluidity of the polymer-IL
   composite triggered by light illumination. The damaged part is
   successfully repaired by shining UV light resulting in solubilization to
   fill the crack, followed by gelation to fix the crack triggered by
   visible light illumination. Tensile tests confirmed the excellent
   recovery efficiency of the resultant photohealed ABA ion gel, which was
   as high as 81\% fracture energy relative to the original sample. The
   flexible, self-supported ABA ion gel is designed for various
   applications to exhibit not only photohealing ability to improve
   operating lifetime of the material but also specific functionalities
   imparted by the IL, such as high ion conductivity, thermal stability,
   and (electro)chemical stability.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous dispersions of a poly(ethylene-alt-propylene)-b-poly(ethylene
   oxide)-b-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PON) triblock terpolymer with
   block molecular weights of 3 000-25 000-10 000 and polymer
   concentrations ranging from 1 to 5 wt \% were investigated at several
   temperatures from 25 to SS degrees C using cryogenic scanning electron
   microscopy (cryo-SEM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy
   (cryo-TEM), and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). The cryo-SEM and
   cryo-TEM micrographs revealed that PUN triblock terpolymer
   self-assembled into spherical micelles with PEP cores and PEO-PNIPAm
   coronae at room temperature and subsequently formed a twocompartment
   micellar network consisting of distinct spherical PEP and PNIPAm cores
   upon heating above the critical gelation temperature (42 degrees C). The
   formation of two discrete spherical PEP and PNIPAm hydrophobic domains
   was supported by detailed SANS analysis of the PUN triblock samples in
   D2O, as the resulting intensity profiles can be successfully fitted
   using a scattering equation based on the two-compartment network
   structure. The two-compartment structure was further confirmed using
   contrast-matching SANS experiments on a PON,12 triblock sample with
   similar block molecular weights and a partially deuterated PNIPAm block.
   An important result of the SANS profiles in the gel state was the
   emergence of two distinct scattering peaks, which could be accounted for
   by considering spatial correlations between PEP and PNIPAm micellar
   cores. This study confirms the hypothesis that the formation of
   two-compartment networks in ABC terpolymer hydrogels results in better
   gelation properties, in comparison to other physically associated
   hydrogels, and can further guide the design and development of advanced
   hydrogel systems with enhanced performance.}},

Title = {{Shear-induced segregation of particles by material density}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{Recently, shear rate gradients and associated gradients in velocity
   fluctuations (e.g., granular temperatures or kinetic stresses) have been
   shown to drive segregation of different-sized particles in a manner that
   reverses at relatively high solids fractions (< f > > 0.50). Here we
   investigate these effects in mixtures of particles differing in material
   density through computational and theoretical studies of particles
   sheared in a vertical chute where we vary the solids fraction from < f >
   = 0.2 to 0.6. We find that in sparse flows, < f > = 0.2 to 0.4, the
   heavier (denser) particles segregate to lower shear rates similarly to
   the heavier (larger) particles in mixtures of particles differing only
   in size. However, there is no segregation reversal at high f in mixtures
   of particles differing in density. At all solids fractions, heavier
   (denser) particles segregate to regions of lower shear rates and lower
   granular temperatures, in contrast with segregation of different-sized
   particles at high f, where the heavier (larger) particles segregate to
   the region of higher shear rates. Kinetic theory predicts well the
   segregation for both types of systems at low f but breaks down at higher
   f's. Our recently proposed mixture theory for high f granular mixtures
   captures the segregation trends well via the independent partitioning of
   kinetic and contact stresses between the two species. In light of these
   results, we discuss possible directions forward for a model framework
   that encompasses segregation effects more broadly in these systems.}},

Abstract = {{Hematopoietic lineage commitment is regulated by cytokines and master
   transcription factors, but it remains unclear how a progenitor cell
   chooses a lineage in the face of conflicting cues. Through transcript
   counting in megakaryocyte-erythroid progenitors undergoing
   erythropoiesis, we show that the expression levels of the
   pro-erythropoiesis transcription factor EKLF (also known as KLF1) and
   receptor EpoR are inversely correlated with their promegakaryopoiesis
   counterparts, FLI-1 and TpoR (also known as MPL). Notably, as
   progenitors commit to the erythrocyte lineage, EpoR is upregulated and
   TpoR is strongly downregulated, thus boosting the potency of the
   pro-erythropoiesis cue erythropoietin and effectively eliminating the
   activity of the pro-megakaryopoiesis cue thrombopoietin. Based on these
   findings, we propose a new model for exclusive decision making that
   explicitly incorporates signals from extrinsic cues, and we
   experimentally confirm a model prediction of temporal changes in
   transcript noise levels in committing progenitors. Our study suggests
   that lineage-specific receptor levels can modulate potencies of cues to
   achieve robust commitment decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The single-group multicast beamforming problem is NP-hard, and the
   available approximations do not always achieve favorable
   performance-complexity tradeoffs. This paper introduces a new class of
   adaptive multicast beamforming algorithms that features guaranteed
   convergence and state-of-the-art performance at low complexity. Each
   update takes a step in the direction of an inverse signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) weighted linear combination of the SNR-gradient vectors of all the
   users. Convergence of this update to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of
   proportionally fair beamforming is established. Simulations show that
   the proposed approach can enable better performance than the prior
   state-of-art in terms of multicast rate, at considerably lower
   complexity. This reveals an interesting link between max-min-fair and
   proportionally fair multicast beamforming formulations. For cases where
   there is no initial channel state information at the transmitter, an
   online algorithm is developed that simultaneously learns the user
   channel correlation matrices and adapts the beamforming vector to
   maximize the minimum (long-term average) SNR among the users, using only
   periodic binary SNR feedback from each receiver. The online algorithm
   uses the analytic center cutting plane method to quickly learn the user
   correlation matrices with limited signaling overhead.}},

   onto one 16 mm x 16 mm chip with a reaction well, and they could work
   independently and be monitored simultaneously. A detect limit of 40
   pg/mL for ST2 antigen had been achieved, and the dynamic ranges for the
   three proteins detection were up to four orders of magnitude. The GMR
   sensing platform was also selective enough to be directly used in serum
   samples. In addition, a lab-based probe station has been designed to
   implement quick lab-on-a-chip experiments instead of wire bonding. It
   has a potential application in clinical biomarkers identification and
   screening, and can be extended to fit other biosensing schemes. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A cyclic pushover test of a three-story steel plate shear wall (SPSW)
   specimen was conducted to investigate the seismic behavior of this
   system when plastic hinge was predicted to develop along the span of
   horizontal boundary elements (HBEs). The experiment demonstrated that
   the in-span plastification caused a significant accumulation of plastic
   incremental deformations of HBEs. It also allowed to experimentally
   verify that moment-rotation hysteresis curves of HBE connections in
   SPSWs are not symmetric, but rather lopsided toward one direction,
   unlike that of special moment-resisting frames. Several of special
   moment connections experienced fractures, which is attributed to a
   higher rotation range prior to fracture of those connections. A finite
   element investigation of the tested specimen showed similar overall
   behavior to that observed during the experiment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystal synthesis in nonthermal plasmas has been focused on
   elemental group IV semiconductors such as Si and Ge. In contrast, very
   little is known about plasma synthesis of compound nanocrystals and the
   time is ripe to extend this synthesis approach to nanocrystals comprised
   of two or more elements such as metal sulfides, oxides and nitrides.
   Towards this end, we studied, in an argon-sulfur plasma, the synthesis
   of ZnS, Cu2S and SnS nanocrystals from metalorganic precursors diethyl
   Zn(II), hexafluoroacetylacetonate Cu(I) vinyltrimethylsilane, and
   tetrakis(dimethylamido) Sn(IV), respectively. In situ optical emission
   spectroscopy was used to observe changes in relative concentrations of
   various plasma species during synthesis, while ex situ material
   characterization was used to examine the crystal structure, elemental
   composition and optical absorption of these nanocrystals. For a constant
   metalorganic vapor feed rate, the elemental composition of the
   nanocrystals was found to be independent of the sulfur flow rate into
   the plasma, above a small threshold value. At constant sulfur flow rate,
   the nanocrystal composition depended on the metalorganic vapor feed
   rate. Specifically, the ensemble metal atomic fraction in the
   nanocrystals was found to increase with increasing metalorganic vapor
   flow rates, resulting in more metal-rich crystal phases. The
   metalorganic feed rate can be used to control the composition and
   crystal phase of the metal-sulfide nanocrystals synthesized using this
   plasma process.}},

Title = {{An improved potential energy surface and multi-temperature
   quasiclassical trajectory calculations of N-2 + N-2 dissociation
   reactions}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Accurate modeling of high-temperature hypersonic flows in the atmosphere
   requires consideration of collision-induced dissociation of molecular
   species and energy transfer between the translational and internal modes
   of the gas molecules. Here, we describe a study of the N-2 + N-2 -> N-2
   + 2N and N-2 + N-2 -> 4N nitrogen dissociation reactions using the
   quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) method. The simulations used a new
   potential energy surface for the N-4 system; the surface is an improved
   version of one that was presented previously. In the QCT calculations,
   initial conditions were determined based on a two-temperature model that
   approximately separates the translational-rotational temperature from
   the vibrational temperature of the N-2 diatoms. Five values from 8000 K
   to 30 000 K were considered for each of the two temperatures. Over 2.4 x
   109 trajectories were calculated. We present results for
   ensemble-averaged dissociation rate constants as functions of the
   translational-rotational temperature T and the vibrational temperature
   T-v. The rate constant depends more strongly on T when T-v is low, and
   it depends more strongly on T-v when T is low. Quasibound reactant
   states contribute significantly to the rate constants, as do exchange
   processes at higher temperatures. We discuss two sets of runs in detail:
   an equilibrium test set in which T = T-v and a nonequilibrium test set
   in which T-v < T. In the equilibrium test set, high-v and
   moderately-low-j molecules contribute most significantly to the overall
   dissociation rate, and this state specificity becomes stronger as the
   temperature decreases. Dissociating trajectories tend to result in a
   major loss of vibrational energy and a minor loss of rotational energy.
   In the nonequilibrium test set, as T-v decreases while T is fixed,
   higher-j molecules contribute more significantly to the dissociation
   rate, dissociating trajectories tend to result in a greater rotational
   energy loss, and the dissociation probability's dependence on v weakens.
   In this way, as T-v decreases, rotational energy appears to compensate
   for the decline in average vibrational energy in promoting dissociation.
   In both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium test sets, in every case, the
   average total internal energy loss in the dissociating trajectories is
   between 10.2 and 11.0 eV, slightly larger than the equilibrium potential
   energy change of N-2 dissociation. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   magnetism. This is investigated here via a small-angle neutron
   scattering (SANS) study of LaCoO3-d crystals. The results provide (i)
   the surprising finding that the spin-state crossover is clearly
   reflected in SANS via quasieleastic and inelastic scattering from
   paramagnetic spin fluctuations and excitations, and (ii) evidence for
   the formation, likely around oxygen defects, of local entities known as
   magnetic excitons. The latter generate distinct magnetic scattering
   below 60 K, providing valuable quantitative information on exciton
   densities and interactions. Potential relevance to the unexpected
   ferromagnetism recently discovered in epitaxial LaCoO3 films is
   discussed.}},

Title = {{DESCENDING AND TONOTOPIC PROJECTION PATTERNS FROM THE AUDITORY CORTEX TO
   THE INFERIOR COLLICULUS}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{300}},
Pages = {{325-337}},
Month = {{AUG 6}},
Abstract = {{The inferior colliculus (IC) receives many corticofugal projections,
   which can mediate plastic changes such as shifts in frequency tuning or
   excitability of IC neurons. While the densest projections are found in
   the IC's external cortices, fibers originating from the primary auditory
   cortex (AI) have been observed throughout the IC's central nucleus
   (ICC), and these projections have shown to be organized tonotopically.
   Some studies have also found projections from other core and non-core
   cortical regions, though the organization and function of these
   projections are less known. In guinea pig, there exists a non-core
   ventrorostral belt (VRB) region that has primary-like properties and has
   often been mistaken for AI, with the clearest differentiating
   characteristic being VRB's longer response latencies. To better
   understand the auditory corticofugal descending system beyond AI, we
   investigated if there are projections from VRB to the ICC and if they
   exhibit a different projection pattern than those from AI. In this
   study, we performed experiments in ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs, in
   which we positioned 32-site electrode arrays within AI, VRB, and ICC. We
   identified the monosynaptic connections between AI-to-ICC and VRB-to-ICC
   using an antidromic stimulation method, and we analyzed their locations
   across the midbrain using three-dimensional histological techniques.
   Compared to the corticocollicular projections to the ICC from AI, there
   were fewer projections to the ICC from VRB, and these projections had a
   weaker tonotopic organization. The majority of VRB projections were
   observed in the caudal-medial versus the rostral-lateral region along an
   isofrequency lamina of the ICC, which is in contrast to the AI
   projections that were scattered throughout an ICC lamina. These findings
   suggest that the VRB directly modulates sound information within the
   ascending lemniscal pathway with a different or complementary role
   compared to the modulatory effects of AI, which may have implications
   for treating hearing disorders. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Measured rates of methyl propyl ether (MPE), an asymmetric ether,
   conversion on gamma-alumina at 623 K verify that hydration rates are
   negligible compared to disproportionation rates below 2.0 kPa of water.
   Steady state kinetic measurements establish that diethyl ether (DEE)
   disproportionation rates possess reaction orders between 0 and 1. A
   mechanism for DEE disproportionation in which ethanol monomers and
   reactive ethoxy species are the primary surface species is consistent
   with measured pressure dependencies. The intrinsic rate constant of DEE
   disproportionation is nearly identical to that of unimolecular ethanol
   dehydration, revealing the similarity in the rate-limiting steps of
   these two reactions. In-situ pyridine titration studies verify that DEE
   disproportionation and unimolecular ethanol dehydration possess similar
   site requirements and densities (0.3 and 0.2 sites nm(-2), respectively)
   while bimolecular ethanol dehydration occurs on a separate pool of

Title = {{Forecasting Seizures Using Intracranial EEG Measures and SVM in
   Naturally Occurring Canine Epilepsy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{Management of drug resistant focal epilepsy would be greatly assisted by
   a reliable warning system capable of alerting patients prior to seizures
   to allow the patient to adjust activities or medication. Such a system
   requires successful identification of a preictal, or seizure-prone
   state. Identification of preictal states in continuous long-duration
   intracranial electroenceph-alographic (iEEG) recordings of dogs with
   naturally occurring epilepsy was investigated using a support vector
   machine (SVM) algorithm. The dogs studied were implanted with a
   16-channel ambulatory iEEG recording device with average channel
   reference for a mean (st. dev.) of 380.4 (+87.5) days producing 220.2
   (+104.1) days of intracranial EEG recorded at 400 Hz for analysis. The
   iEEG records had 51.6 (+52.8) seizures identified, of which 35.8 (+30.4)
   seizures were preceded by more than 4 hours of seizure-free data.
   Recorded iEEG data were stratified into 11 contiguous, non-overlapping
   frequency bands and binned into one-minute synchrony features for
   analysis. Performance of the SVM classifier was assessed using a 5-fold
   cross validation approach, where preictal training data were taken from
   90 minute windows with a 5 minute pre-seizure offset. Analysis of the
   optimal preictal training time was performed by repeating the cross
   validation over a range of preictal windows and comparing results. We
   show that the optimization of feature selection varies for each subject,
   i.e. algorithms are subject specific, but achieve prediction performance
   significantly better than a time-matched Poisson random predictor
   (p<0.05) in 5/5 dogs analyzed.}},

Title = {{Thermal Transport in Fullerene Derivatives Using Molecular Dynamics
   Simulations}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 4}},
Abstract = {{In order to study the effects of alkyl chain on the thermal properties
   of fullerene derivatives, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
   to predict the thermal conductivity of fullerene (C-60) and its
   derivative phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). The results of
   non-equilibrium MD simulations show a length-dependent thermal
   conductivity for C-60 but not for PCBM. The thermal conductivity of
   C-60, obtained from the linear extrapolation of inverse conductivity vs.
   inverse length curve, is 0.2 W m(-1) K-1 at room temperature, while the
   thermal conductivity of PCBM saturates at similar to 0.075 W m(-1) K-1
   around 20 nm. The different length-dependence behavior of thermal
   conductivity indicates that the long-wavelength and low-frequency
   phonons have large contribution to the thermal conduction in C-60. The
   decrease in thermal conductivity of fullerene derivatives can be
   attributed to the reduction in group velocities, the decrease of the
   frequency range of acoustic phonons, and the strong scattering of
   low-frequency phonons with the alkyl chains due to the significant
   mismatch of vibrational density of states in low frequency regime
   between buckyball and alkyl chains in PCBM.}},

   energy-integrated networks (comprising of large energy recycle or

   lends them to a graph theoretic analysis, whereby weak and strong
   connections between process units arising from time scale separation are
   identified from structural information. Subsequently, a graph-theoretic
   framework for network analysis and control is developed, and connecting
   links are built to an equivalent analysis using singular perturbations.
   The proposed analysis framework is illustrated via application to a

Abstract = {{This study compares the fungal growth ratio on loaded ventilation
   filters under various temperature, relative humidity (RH), and air flow
   conditions in a controlled laboratory setting. A new full-size
   commercial building ventilation filter was loaded with malt extract
   nutrients and conidia of Cladosporium sphaerospermum in an ASHRAE
   Standard 52.2 filter test facility. Small sections cut from this filter
   were incubated under the following conditions: constant room temperature
   and a high RH of 97\%; sinusoidal temperature (with an amplitude of 10
   degrees C, an average of 23 degrees C, and a period of 24hr) and a mean
   RH of 97\%; room temperature and step changes between 97\% and 75\% RH,
   97\% and 43\% RH, and 97\% and 11\% RH every 12hr. The biomass on the
   filter sections was measured using both an elution-culture method and by
   ergosterol assay immediately after loading and every 2days up to 10days
   after loading. Fungal growth was detected earlier using ergosterol
   content than with the elution-culture method. A student's t-test
   indicated that Cladosporium sphaerospermum grew better at the constant
   room temperature condition than at the sinusoidal temperature condition.
   By part-time exposure to dry environments, the fungal growth was reduced
   (75\% and 43\% RH) or even inhibited (11\% RH). Additional loaded
   filters were installed in the wind tunnel at room temperature and an RH
   greater than 95\% under one of two air flow test conditions: continuous
   air flow or air flow only 9hr/day with a flow rate of 0.7 m(3)/s (filter
   media velocity 0.15 m/s). Swab tests and a tease mount method were used
   to detect fungal growth on the filters at day 0, 5, and 10. Fungal
   growth was detected for both test conditions, which indicates that when
   temperature and relative humidity are optimum, controlling the air flow
   alone cannot prevent fungal growth. In real applications where nutrients
   are less sufficient than in this laboratory study, fungal growth rate
   may be reduced under the same operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{By combination of a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) with a filter
   with uniform pores, namely a filter sensor, a new method for
   differentiating nanoparticles with various mass-mobility fractal
   dimensions, D-fm, was developed and validated experimentally and
   theoretically. The sensor is also able to measure the effective length
   (or maximum projected length) of nanoparticles with different shapes,
   which is an important parameter responsible for the lung deposition due
   to interception. At the same mobility diameter, it was observed that the
   compact NaCl had the highest penetration followed by partially sintered
   silver (Ag) aggregates and then the loose Ag and soot agglomerates. The
   result indicates that the stronger interception by the filter is
   correlated to the more elongated shape of the particles. A modified
   capillary tube model for predicting the penetration of Ag nanoparticles
   with different mass-mobility fractal dimensions was validated by
   experimental data. By using the validated model, this study found that
   the sensor could have a further enhanced sensitivity if the porosity and
   thickness of the filter were adjusted to 0.01 and 5 mu m, respectively.
   The penetration differences obtained from the model are as high as
   7-18\%, 14-35\%, and 24-40\% between spheres and loose agglomerates
   (D-fm = 2.1) for 50-100, 100-300, and 300-1000nm particles as the filter
   pore sizes are 0.4, 1, and 3 mu m, respectively. This new filter sensor
   can measure the effective length and mass-mobility fractal dimension in
   nearly real-time and may be applied in nanotoxicity studies and quality
   control of nanomaterial productions (e.g., by flame reactors).Copyright

Abstract = {{Although cell-free directed evolution methods have been used to engineer
   proteins for nearly two decades, selections on more complex phenotypes
   have largely remained in the domain of cell-based engineering
   approaches. Here, we review recent conceptual advances that now enable
   in vitro display of multimeric proteins, integral membrane proteins, and
   proteins with an expanded amino acid repertoire. Additionally, we
   discuss methodological improvements that have enhanced the
   accessibility, efficiency, and robustness of cell-free approaches.
   Coupling these advances with the in vitro advantages of creating
   exceptionally large libraries and precisely controlling all experimental
   conditions, cell-free directed evolution is poised to contribute
   significantly to our understanding and engineering of more complex

Abstract = {{The ozone density distribution in the effluent of a time modulated RF
   atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) is investigated by time and
   spatially resolved by UV absorption spectroscopy. The plasma jet is
   operated with an averaged dissipated power of 6.5 W and gas flow rate 2
   slm argon +2\% O-2. The modulation frequency of the RF power is 50 Hz
   with a duty cycle of 50\%. To investigate the production and destruction
   mechanism of ozone in the plasma effluent, the atomic oxygen and gas
   temperature is also obtained by TALIF and Rayleigh scattering,
   respectively. A temporal increase in ozone density is observed close to
   the quartz tube exit when the plasma is switched off due to the decrease
   in O density and gas temperature. Ozone absorption at different axial
   positions indicates that the ozone distribution is dominated by the
   convection induced by the gas flow and allows estimating the on-axis
   local gas velocity in the jet effluent. Transient vortex structures
   occurring during the switch on and off of the RF power also
   significantly affect the ozone density in the far effluent.}},

Volume = {{51}},

Pages = {{6756-6775}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We present the comprehensive discharge potential for steady
   three-dimensional flow in horizontally stratified coastal aquifers with
   a horizontal base and a vertical coastline. The gradient of this
   comprehensive potential gives the vertically integrated discharge
   throughout the aquifer, i.e., the specific discharge vector as a
   function of three-dimensional space integrated over the saturated
   portion of the aquifer. The boundary values of the comprehensive
   potential along the coast can be computed precisely, given the geometry
   of the aquifer: the hydraulic conductivities of the strata, the
   elevations of the horizontal planes that separate the strata, and the
   elevation of the impermeable base of the aquifer relative to sea level.
   Boundary conditions of the comprehensive potential may either be given
   in terms of its gradient, or computed from given heads along the
   boundaries. The governing equation of the comprehensive potential is the
   Poisson equation in areas of infiltration and the Laplace equation
   elsewhere. The computation of interface elevations, piezometric heads,
   and the vertical distribution of flow requires that an assumption be
   made regarding the relation between the comprehensive potential and
   piezometric heads. We adopt the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation for
   this purpose and make use of the Ghyben-Herzberg equation. We present
   several applications of the approach and find that the stratification
   may have a significant effect on the boundary value of the comprehensive
   potential, and thus on the flow rates in the aquifer.}},

Abstract = {{Non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harbor thousands of passenger events
   that hide genetic drivers. Even highly recurrent events in NSCLC, such
   as mutations in PTEN, EGFR, KRAS, and ALK, are detected, at most, in
   only 30\% of patients. Thus, many unidentified low-penetrant events are
   causing a significant portion of lung cancers. To detect low-penetrance
   drivers of NSCLC, a forward genetic screen was performed in mice using
   the Sleeping Beauty (SB) DNA transposon as a random mutagen to generate
   lung tumors in a Pten-deficient background. SB mutations coupled with
   Pten deficiency were sufficient to produce lung tumors in 29\% of mice.
   Pten deficiency alone, without SB mutations, resulted in lung tumors in
   11\% of mice, whereas the rate in control mice was approximately 3\%. In
   addition, thyroid cancer and other carcinomas, as well as the presence
   of bronchiolar and alveolar epithelialization, in mice deficient for
   Pten were also identified. Analysis of common transposon insertion sites
   identified 76 candidate cancer driver genes. These genes are frequently
   dysregulated in human lung cancers and implicate several signaling
   pathways. Cullin3 (Cul3), a member of a ubiquitin ligase complex that
   plays a role in the oxidative stress response pathway, was identified in
   the screen and evidence demonstrates that Cul3 functions as a tumor
   suppressor. (C) 2015 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Recorded neural data are frequently corrupted by large amplitude
   artifacts that are triggered by a variety of sources, such as subject
   movements, organ motions, electromagnetic interferences and discharges
   at the electrode surface. To prevent the system from saturating and the
   electronics from malfunctioning due to these large artifacts, a wide
   dynamic range for data acquisition is demanded, which is quite
   challenging to achieve and would require excessive circuit area and
   power for implementation. In this paper, we present a high performance
   Delta-Sigma modulator along with several design techniques and enabling
   blocks to reduce circuit area and power. The modulator was fabricated in
   a 0.18-m CMOS process. Powered by a 1.0-V supply, the chip can achieve
   an 85-dB peak signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratio (SNDR) and an 87-dB
   dynamic range when integrated over a 10-kHz bandwidth. The total power
   consumption of the modulator is 13 W, which corresponds to a
   figure-of-merit (FOM) of 45 fJ/conversion step. These competitive
   circuit specifications make this design a good candidate for building
   high precision neurosensors.}},

Abstract = {{High-frequency stimulation is known to entrain spike activity downstream
   and upstream of several clinical deep brain stimulation (DBS) targets,
   including the cerebellar-receiving area of thalamus (VPLo), subthalamic
   nucleus (STN), and globus pallidus (GP). Less understood are the
   fidelity of entrainment to each stimulus pulse, whether entrainment
   patterns are stationary over time, and how responses differ among DBS
   targets. In this study, three rhesus macaques were implanted with a
   single DBS lead in VPLo, STN, or GP. Single-unit spike activity was
   recorded in the resting state in motor cortex during VPLo DBS, in GP
   during STN DBS, and in STN and pallidal-receiving area of motor thalamus
   (VLo) during GP DBS. VPLo DBS induced time-locked spike activity in 25\%
   (n = 15/61) of motor cortex cells, with entrained cells following 7.5
   +/- 7.4\% of delivered pulses. STN DBS entrained spike activity in 26\%
   (n = 8/27) of GP cells, which yielded time-locked spike activity for 8.7
   +/- 8.4\% of stimulus pulses. GP DBS entrained 67\% (n = 14/21) of STN
   cells and 32\% (n = 19/59) of VLo cells, which showed a higher fraction
   of pulses effectively inhibiting spike activity (82.0 +/- 9.6\% and 86.1
   +/- 16.6\%, respectively). Latency of phase-locked spike activity
   increased over time in motor cortex (58\%, VPLo DBS) and to a lesser
   extent in GP (25\%, STN DBS). In contrast, the initial inhibitory phase
   observed in VLo and STN during GP DBS remained stable following
   stimulation onset. Together, these data suggest that circuit-level
   entrainment is low-pass filtered during high-frequency stimulation, most
   notably for glutamatergic pathways. Moreover, phase entrainment is not
   stationary or consistent at the circuit level for all DBS targets.}},

Title = {{Direct molecular simulation of nitrogen dissociation based on an ab
   initio potential energy surface}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The direct molecular simulation (DMS) approach is used to predict the
   internal energy relaxation and dissociation dynamics of high-temperature
   nitrogen. An ab initio potential energy surface (PES) is used to
   calculate the dynamics of two interacting nitrogen molecules by
   providing forces between the four atoms. In the near-equilibrium limit,
   it is shown that DMS reproduces the results obtained from
   well-established quasiclassical trajectory (QCT) analysis, verifying the
   validity of the approach. DMS is used to predict the vibrational
   relaxation time constant for N-2-N-2 collisions and its temperature
   dependence, which are in close agreement with existing experiments and
   theory. Using both QCT and DMS with the same PES, we find that
   dissociation significantly depletes the upper vibrational energy levels.
   As a result, across a wide temperature range, the dissociation rate is
   found to be approximately 4-5 times lower compared to the rates computed
   using QCT with Boltzmann energy distributions. DMS calculations predict
   a quasi-steady-state distribution of rotational and vibrational energies
   in which the rate of depletion of high-energy states due to dissociation
   is balanced by their rate of repopulation due to collisional processes.
   The DMS approach simulates the evolution of internal energy
   distributions and their coupling to dissociation without the need to
   precompute rates or cross sections for all possible energy transitions.
   These benchmark results could be used to develop new computational fluid
   dynamics models for high-enthalpy flow applications. (C) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{We report the results of an extensive investigation of metal molecule
   metal tunnel junctions based on oligophenylene dithiols (OPDs) bound to
   several types of electrodes (M-1- S-(C6H4)(n)-S-M-2, with 1 <= n <= 4
   and M-1,M-2 = Ag, Au, Pt) to examine the impact of molecular length (n)
   and metal work function (Phi) on junction properties. Our investigation
   includes (1) measurements by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy of
   electrode work function changes (Delta Phi = Phi(SAM) - Phi) caused by
   chemisorption of OPD self-assembled monolayers (SAMs), (2) measurements
   of junction current voltage (I-V) characteristics by conducting probe
   atomic force microscopy in the linear and nonlinear bias ranges, and (3)
   direct quantitative analysis of the full I-V curves. Further, we employ
   transition voltage spectroscopy (TVS) to estimate the energetic
   alignment epsilon(h)= E-F - E-HOMO of the dominant molecular orbital
   (HOMO) relative to the Fermi energy EF of the junction. Where
   photoelectron spectroscopy data are available, the Eh values agree very
   well with those determined by TVS. Using a single-level model, which we
   justify via ab initio quantum chemical calculations at post-density
   functional theory level and additional UV visible absorption
   measurements, we are able to quantitatively reproduce the I-V
   measurements in the whole bias range investigated (similar to 1.0-1.5 V)
   and to understand the behavior of epsilon(h) and Gamma (contact coupling
   strength) extracted from experiment. We find that Fermi level pinning
   induced by the strong dipole of the metal-S bond causes a significant
   shift of the HOMO energy of an adsorbed molecule, resulting in eh
   exhibiting a weak dependence with the work function Phi. Both of these
   parameters play a key role in determining the tunneling attenuation
   factor (beta) and junction resistance (R). Correlation among Phi, Delta
   Phi, R, transition voltage (V-t), and epsilon(h) and accurate simulation
   provide a remarkably complete picture of tunneling transport in these
   prototypical molecular junctions.}},

Abstract = {{In today's complex and dynamic supply chain markets, information systems
   are essential for effective supply chain management. Complex decision
   making processes on strategic, tactical, and operational levels require
   substantial timely support in order to contribute to organizations'
   agility. Consequently, there is a need for sophisticated dynamic product
   pricing mechanisms that can adapt quickly to changing market conditions
   and competitors' strategies. We propose a two-layered machine learning
   approach to compute tactical pricing decisions in real time. The first
   layer estimates prevailing economic conditionseconomic
   regimesidentifying and predicting current and future market conditions.
   In the second layer, we train a neural network for each regime to
   estimate price distributions in real time using available information.
   The neural networks compute offer acceptance probabilities from a
   tactical perspective to meet desired sales quotas. We validate our
   approach in the trading agent competition for supply chain management.
   When competing against the world's leading agents, the performance of
   our system significantly improves compared to using only economic
   regimes to predict prices. Profits increase significantly even though
   the prices and sales volume do not change significantly. Instead,
   tactical pricing results in a more efficient sales strategy by reducing
   both finished goods and components inventory costs.}},

Abstract = {{The development of methods for achieving precise spatiotemporal control
   over chemical and biomolecular gradients could enable significant
   advances in areas such as synthetic tissue engineering, biotic-abiotic
   interfaces, and bionanotechnology. Living organisms guide tissue
   development through highly orchestrated gradients of biomolecules that
   direct cell growth, migration, and differentiation. While numerous
   methods have been developed to manipulate and implement biomolecular
   gradients, integrating gradients into multiplexed, three-dimensional
   (3D) matrices remains a critical challenge. Here we present a method to
   3D print stimuli-responsive core/shell capsules for programmable release
   of multiplexed gradients within hydrogel matrices. These capsules are
   composed of an aqueous core, which can be formulated to maintain the
   activity of payload biomolecules, and a poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid
   (PLGA, an FDA approved polymer) shell. Importantly, the shell can be
   loaded with plasmonic gold nanorods (AuNRs), which permits selective
   rupturing of the capsule when irradiated with a laser wavelength
   specifically determined by the lengths of the nanorods. This precise
   control over space, time, and selectivity allows for the ability to
   pattern 2D and 3D multiplexed arrays of enzyme-loaded capsules along
   with tunable laser-triggered rupture and release of active enzymes into
   a hydrogel ambient. The advantages of this 3D printing-based method
   include (1) highly monodisperse capsules, (2) efficient encapsulation of
   biomolecular payloads, (3) precise spatial patterning of capsule arrays,
   (4) ``on the fly{''} programmable reconfiguration of gradients, and (5)
   versatility for incorporation in hierarchical architectures. Indeed, 3D
   printing of programmable release capsules may represent a powerful new
   tool to enable spatiotemporal control over biomolecular gradients.}},

   materials due to silicon's low cost and low toxicity. While surface
   plasmonic resonances of boron-doped and phosphorus-doped silicon nano
   crystals were recently observed, there currently is poor understanding
   of the effect of surface conditions on their plasmonic behavior. Here,
   we demonstrate that phosphorus-doped silicon nanocrystals exhibit a
   plasmon resonance immediately after their synthesis but may lose their
   plasmonic response with oxidation. In contrast, boron-doped nanocrystals
   initially do not exhibit plasmonic response but become plasmonically
   active through postsynthesis oxidation or annealing. We interpret these
   results in terms of substitutional doping being the dominant doping
   mechanism for phosphorus-doped silicon nanocrystals, with
   oxidation-induced defects trapping free electrons. The behavior of
   boron-doped silicon nanocrystals is more consistent with a strong
   contribution of surface doping. Importantly, boron-doped silicon
   nanocrystals exhibit air-stable plasmonic behavior over periods of more
   than a year.}},

Abstract = {{A number of structural coverage criteria have been proposed to measure
   the adequacy of testing efforts. In the avionics and other critical
   systems domains, test suites satisfying structural coverage criteria are
   mandated by standards. With the advent of powerful automated test
   generation tools, it is tempting to simply generate test inputs to
   satisfy these structural coverage criteria. However, while techniques to
   produce coverage-providing tests are well established, the effectiveness
   of such approaches in terms of fault detection ability has not been
   adequately studied. In this work, we evaluate the effectiveness of test
   suites generated to satisfy four coverage criteria through
   counterexample-based test generation and a random generation
   approach-where tests are randomly generated until coverage is
   achieved-contrasted against purely random test suites of equal size. Our
   results yield three key conclusions. First, coverage criteria
   satisfaction alone can be a poor indication of fault finding
   effectiveness, with inconsistent results between the seven case examples
   (and random test suites of equal size often providing similar-or even
   higher-levels of fault finding). Second, the use of structural coverage
   as a supplement-rather than a target-for test generation can have a
   positive impact, with random test suites reduced to a coverage-providing
   subset detecting up to 13.5 percent more faults than test suites
   generated specifically to achieve coverage. Finally, Observable MC/DC, a
   criterion designed to account for program structure and the selection of
   the test oracle, can-in part-address the failings of traditional
   structural coverage criteria, allowing for the generation of test suites
   achieving higher levels of fault detection than random test suites of
   equal size. These observations point to risks inherent in the increase
   in test automation in critical systems, and the need for more research
   in how coverage criteria, test generation approaches, the test oracle
   used, and system structure jointly influence test effectiveness.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The majority of reports in which microvascular network properties are
   quantified rely on manual measurements, which are time consuming to
   collect and somewhat subjective. Despite some progress in creating
   automated image analysis techniques, the parameters measured by these
   methods are limited. For example, no automated system has yet been able
   to measure support cell recruitment, which is an important indicator of
   microvascular maturity. Microvessel alignment is another parameter that
   existing programs have not measured, despite a strong dependence of
   performance on alignment in some tissues. Here we present two image
   analysis programs, a semi-automated program that analyzes cross sections
   of microvascular networks and a fully automated program that analyzes
   images of whole mount preparations. Both programs quantify standard
   characteristics as well as support cell recruitment and microvascular
   network alignment, and were highly accurate in comparison to manual
   measurements for engineered tissues containing self-assembled
   microvessels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the benefit of production/service capacity sharing for a set
   of independent firms. Firms have the choice of either operating their
   own production/service facilities or investing in a facility that is
   shared. Facilities are modeled as queueing systems with finite service
   rates. Firms decide on capacity levels (the service rate) to minimize
   delay costs and capacity investment costs possibly subject to
   service-level constraints on delay. If firms decide to operate a shared
   facility they must also decide on a scheme for sharing the capacity
   cost. We formulate the problem as a cooperative game and identify
   settings under which capacity sharing is beneficial and there is a cost
   allocation that is in the core under either the first-come, first-served
   policy or an optimal priority policy. We show that capacity sharing may
   not be beneficial in settings where firms have heterogeneous work
   contents and service variabilities. In such cases, we specify conditions
   under which capacity sharing may still be beneficial for a subset of the
   firms.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a continuous facility location problem in which our

   costs from installing the facilities, (2) backbone network costs
   incurred from connecting the facilities to each other, and (3)
   transportation costs incurred from providing services from the
   facilities to the service region. We first analyze the limiting behavior
   of this model and derive the two asymptotically optimal configurations
   of facilities: one of these configurations is the well studied honeycomb
   heuristic, and the other is an Archimedean spiral. We then give a fast
   constant-factor approximation algorithm for finding the placement of a
   set of facilities in any convex polygon that minimizes the sum of the
   three aforementioned costs.}},

Abstract = {{A niche opportunity to produce algal biofuel more cost effective from
   the effluent of piggery anaerobic digestion drives the research to make
   the effluent an ideal medium for algal growth. The pretreatment of the
   effluent became a challenge because of the requirement of non-toxic and
   eco-friendly methods compared to chemical reagents. The clarity and N/P
   ratio are two crucial factors for the pretreatment of digested effluent
   because light penetration and nutrient ratio influence the algal biomass
   accumulation. Hence, Phanerochaete chrysosporium was chosen to deal with
   the digested effluent and the growth conditions were optimized by
   response surface method. The optimal conditions for the pretreatment by
   P. chrysosporium were pH 6.26, 25 degrees C and an inoculum amount of
   9.96 mL. The decolorization and the reduction of total phosphorus
   reached 78.2 and 74.3\%, respectively, indicating the efficiency of the
   response surface method. The N/P ratio reached 14:1 and a COD reduction
   of 98.34\% at pH 8 at 35 degrees C. Therefore, P. chrysosporium is an
   effective microorganism to make the effluent from piggery anaerobic
   digestion an ideal medium for algal growth.}},

Abstract = {{Benzocliazepines (BZDs), including diazepam (DZP) and miclazolam (MDZ),
   arc drugs of choice for rapid treatment of seizure emergencies. Current
   approved use of these drugs involves administration via either
   intravenous or rectal routes. The former requires trained medical
   personnel, while the latter is socially unacceptable for many patients
   and caregivers. In recent years, efforts have been made to formulate
   BZDs for nasal administration. Because of the low solubility of these
   molecules, organic vehicles have been used to solubilize the drugs in
   the nasal products under development. However, organic solvents are
   irritating, potentially resulting in injury to nasal tissue. Here we
   report preliminary studies supporting a strategy in which water-soluble
   BZD prodrugs and a suitable converting enzyme are coadministered in an
   aqueous vehicle. Diazepam and midazolam prodrugs were synthesized and
   were readily converted to their active forms by a protease from
   Aspergillus oryzae. Using a permeation assay based on monolayers of
   Madin-Darby canine kidney 11 wild type cells, we found that
   enzymatically produced BZDs could be maintained at high degrees of
   supersaturation, enabling faster transport across the membrane than can
   be achieved using saturated solutions. This strategy not only obviates
   the need for organic solvents, but it also suggests more rapid
   absorption and earlier peak concentrations than can be otherwise
   achieved. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of actively locating a static target using mobile
   robots equipped with bearing sensors. The goal is to reduce the
   uncertainty in the target's location to a value below a given threshold
   in minimum time. Our cost formulation explicitly models time spent in
   traveling, as well as taking measurements. In addition, we consider
   distance-based communication constraints between the robots. We provide
   the following theoretical results. First, we study the properties of an
   optimal offline strategy for one or more robots with access to the
   target's true location. We derive the optimal offline algorithm and
   bound its cost when considering a single robot or an even number of
   robots. In other cases, we provide a close approximation. Second, we
   provide a general method of converting the offline algorithm into an
   online adaptive algorithm (that does not have access to the target's
   true location), while preserving near optimality. Using these two
   results, we present an online strategy proven to locate the target up to
   a desired uncertainty level at near-optimal cost. In addition to
   theoretical analysis, we validate the algorithm in simulations and
   multiple field experiments performed using autonomous surface vehicles
   carrying radio antennas to localize radio tags.}},

Abstract = {{Intramyocardial transplantation of cardiomyocytes (CMs), endothelial
   cells (ECs), and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) derived from human induced
   pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) has beneficial effects on the
   post-infarction heart. However, the mechanisms underlying the functional
   improvements remain undefined. We employed large-scale label-free
   quantitative proteomics to identify proteins that were differentially
   regulated following cellular transplantation in a swine model of
   myocardial infarction (MI). We identified 22 proteins that were
   significantly up-regulated after trilineage cell transplantation
   compared to both MI and Sham groups. Among them, 12 proteins, including
   adenylyl cyclase-associated protein 1 and tropomodulin-1, are associated
   with positive regulation of muscular contraction whereas 11 proteins,
   such as desmoplakin and zyxin, are involved in embryonic and muscular
   development and regeneration. Moreover, we identified 21 proteins
   up-regulated and another 21 down-regulated in MI, but reversed after
   trilineage cell transplantation. Proteins up-regulated after MI but
   reversed by transplantation are related to fibrosis and apoptosis.
   Conversely, proteins down-regulated in MI but restored after cell
   therapy are regulators of protein nitrosylation. Our results show that
   the functionally beneficial effects of trilineage cell therapy are
   accompanied by differential regulation of protein expression in the
   recipient myocardium, which may contribute to the improved cardiac
   function.}},

Title = {{WiseThrottling: a new asynchronous task scheduler for mitigating I/O

Abstract = {{Datacenter servers are stepping into an era marked by powerful
   multi-/many-core processors. Severe problems such as I/O contentions in
   those large-scale platforms pose an unprecedented challenge. Prior
   studies primarily considered I/O bandwidth as a major performance
   bottleneck. However, our work reveals that in many cases the fundamental
   cause of I/O contentions is the inefficiency of OS schedulers.
   Particularly, the modern system is not aware of this fact and thus
   suffers from poor I/O performance, especially for datacenter servers.
   Based on our findings, we propose a new software-based scheduling
   approach, WiseThrottling, to reduce I/O contention. WiseThrottling
   performs asynchronous and self-adjustment scheduling for concurrent
   tasks. We evaluate our approach across a wide range of
   C/OpenMP/MapReduce workloads on a 64-core server in Dawning Cluster
   datacenter. The experimental results exhibit that WiseThrottling is
   effective for reducing the I/O bottleneck and it can improve the overall
   system performance by up to 207 \%.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF WIND ENGINEERING AND INDUSTRIAL AERODYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{143}},
Pages = {{105-112}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The near-field signature of the vortical structures shed from the blade
   tips behind a 2.5 MW horizontal axis wind turbine in a stably-stratified
   atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) was quantified for the first time. This
   study utilizes wind velocity measurements from sonic anemometers
   installed on a meteorological tower, which offers continuous
   characterization of wind conditions in the field, at elevations
   coinciding with the bottom, hub and top tip heights of the turbine.
   Using the stringent criteria on wind speed, direction and steadiness, we
   are able to subsample the dataset in which the sonic anemometers are
   positioned near the edge of the turbine wake. The spectral analysis of
   this dataset shows a distinct peak at the turbine rotational frequency
   (f(T)) for hub and top tip height measurements. Based on recent
   literature, we infer that this peak is the signature of tip-vortices,
   and the shift of this signature from blade-passing frequency (3f(T)) to
   f(T) is likely to be caused by vortex grouping phenomena. Slight changes
   of mean wind direction in other data samples result in the absence of
   the spectral peak, suggesting the very local extent of tip vortices. (c)

Abstract = {{Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a devastating, fatal neurological
   disease that primarily affects spinal cord anterior horn cells and their
   axons for which there is no treatment. Here we report the use of a
   recombinant natural human IgM that binds to the surface of neurons and
   supports neurite extension, rHIgM12, as a therapeutic strategy in murine
   models of human ALS. A single 200 mu g intraperitoneal dose of rHIgM12
   increases survival in two independent genetic-based mutant SOD1 mouse
   strains (SOD1G86R and SOD1G93A) by 8 and 10 days, delays the onset of
   neurological deficits by 16 days, delays the onset of weight loss by 5
   days, and preserves spinal cord axons and anterior horn neurons.
   Immuno-overlay of thin layer chromatography and surface plasmon
   resonance show that rHIgM12 binds with high affinity to the complex
   gangliosides GD1a and GT1b. Addition of rHIgM12 to neurons in culture
   increases a-tubulin tyrosination levels, suggesting an alteration of
   microtubule dynamics. We previously reported that a single peripheral
   dose of rHIgM12 preserved neurological function in a murine model of
   demyelination with axon loss. Because rHIgM12 improves three different
   models of neurological disease, we propose that the IgM might act late
   in the cascade of neuronal stress and/or death by a broad mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss a kind of special nonconvex homogenous
   quadratic programming (HQP) and the methods to solve the HQP in an
   environment with certainty or uncertainty. In an environment with
   certainty, we first establish a strong duality between the HQP and its
   Lagrange dual problem, with the help of the fact that the Lagrange dual
   problem is equivalent to a convex semidefinite programming (SDP). Then
   we obtain a global solution to the HQP by solving the convex SDP.
   Furthermore, in an environment with uncertainty, we formulate the robust
   counterpart of the HQP to cope with uncertainty. We also establish the
   robust strong duality between the robust counterpart and its optimistic
   counterpart under a mild assumption. Since the counterpart is equivalent
   to a convex SDP under the same assumption, we can obtain a global
   solution to the robust counterpart by solving the convex SDP under the
   same assumption.}},

Abstract = {{Approximating high order tensors by low Tucker-rank tensors have
   applications in psychometrics, chemometrics, computer vision, biomedical
   informatics, among others. Traditionally, solution methods for finding a
   low Tucker-rank approximation presume that the size of the core tensor
   is specified in advance, which may not be a realistic assumption in many
   applications. In this paper we propose a new computational model where
   the configuration and the size of the core become a part of the
   decisions to be optimized. Our approach is based on the so-called
   maximum block improvement method for non-convex block optimization.
   Numerical tests on various real data sets from gene expression analysis
   and image compression are reported, which show promising performances of
   the proposed algorithms.}},

Title = {{Downstream lightening and upward heavying: Experiments with sediments
   differing in density}},
Journal = {{SEDIMENTOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{62}},

Pages = {{1384-1407}},

Abstract = {{Sorting and selective transport of particles by material density is
   important for understanding a wide range of processes, including the
   formation of mineral placers, deposition of mine tailings and routing of
   tracers and contaminants. This article describes an experimental study
   of the transport of mixtures of particles of differing density in a
   sediment-feed flume. During the runs, a downstream prograding
   wedge-shaped deposit was formed. Results show two sorting processes: (i)
   longitudinal sorting characterized by preferential deposition of heavy
   particles in the upstream part of the deposit - downstream lightening;
   and (ii) vertical sorting with less dense particles preferentially
   deposited in the lowermost portion of the migrating front - upward
   heavying. Downstream lightening is the analogue of the well-known
   downstream fining observed in the more studied case of mixtures of
   heterogeneous size with the same density. In both cases, the lighter
   particles are carried further downstream than the heavier particles.
   Upward heavying is unexpected when compared with deposits of
   heterogeneous size and same-density particles, where the heaviest (i.e.
   coarsest) particles are deposited in the lowermost part of the front.
   The physical mechanism underlying this upward heavying might be related
   to the physics of gravity-driven granular flows; the front of the
   deposit acts like a dense granular flow down an inclined plane. In this
   case, the denser particles settle away from the free surface and at the
   top of the heap, while the lighter particles flow to the bottom. As the
   front of the deposit advances, this progressively gives rise to an
   upward heavying pattern. The application of classical surface-based
   fractional bedload transport models suggests that equal mobility is not
   approached in the case of mixtures of particles with uniform size and
   different densities. This study hypothesizes that other mechanics
   related to the physics of the segregation processes in these systems
   contribute to these results.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic sensors have previously been used for position measurement only
   at very small distances between the magnet and the sensor. While they
   could potentially also be used at larger distances by exploiting
   nonlinear magnetic field functions, a serious challenge comes from
   magnetic disturbances. The presence of foreign ferromagnetic objects,
   variations in the Earth's magnetic field with location, and
   electromagnetic disturbances can cause such position estimation systems
   to have significant errors. This paper enables robust large-distance
   position estimation using redundant sensors and real-time disturbance
   estimation. Adaptive estimation algorithms that auto-calibrate magnetic
   parameters and compensate for disturbances are developed. Experimental
   results with a pneumatic cylinder demonstrate that sub-millimeter
   accuracies in position measurement can be obtained with such a system in
   spite of disturbances from external ferromagnetic objects. The developed
   sensing principle has a large number of applications, including position
   estimation in pneumatic cylinders, hydraulic actuators, spool valves,
   and many other machinery.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertension (HTN) is the single greatest risk factor for potentially
   fatal cardiovascular diseases. One cause of HTN is inappropriately
   increased sympathetic nervous system activity, suggesting that restoring
   the autonomic nervous balance may be an effective means of HTN
   treatment. Here, we studied the potential of vagus nerve stimulation
   (VNS) to treat chronic HTN and cardiac arrhythmias through stimulation
   of the right cervical vagus nerve in hypertensive rats. Dahl
   salt-sensitive rats (n = 12) were given a high salt diet to induce HTN.
   After 6 weeks, rats were randomized into two groups: HTN-Sham and
   HTN-VNS, in which VNS was provided to HTN-VNS group for 4 weeks. In vivo
   blood pressure and electrocardiogram activities were monitored
   continuously by an implantable telemetry system. After 10 weeks, rats
   were euthanized and their hearts were extracted for ex vivo
   electrophysiological studies using high-resolution optical mapping. Six
   weeks of high salt diet significantly increased both mean arterial
   pressure (MAP) and pulse pressure, demonstrating successful induction of
   HTN in all rats. After 4 weeks of VNS treatment, the increase in MAP and
   the number of arrhythmia episodes in HTN-VNS rats was significantly
   attenuated when compared to those observed in HTN-Sham rats. VNS
   treatment also induced changes in electrophysiological properties of the
   heart, such as reduction in action potential duration (APD) during rapid
   drive pacing, slope of APD restitution, spatial dispersion of APD, and
   increase in conduction velocity of impulse propagation. Overall, these
   results provide further evidence for the therapeutic efficacy of VNS in
   HTN and HTN-related heart diseases.}},

Abstract = {{This demonstration presents HadoopViz; an extensible MapReduce-based

   details of the MapReduce algorithms. We show how it is used to create
   four types of visualizations, namely, scatter plot, road network,
   frequency heat map, and temperature heat map. (2) HadoopViz is capable
   of generating big images with giga-pixel resolution by employing a
   three-phase approach of partitioning, rasterize, and merging. HadoopViz
   generates single and multi-level images, where the latter allows users
   to zoom intout to get more/less details. Both types of images are
   generated with a very high resolution using the extensible and scalable
   framework of HadoopViz.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Abstract = {{Successful operation of a miniature rotorcraft relies on capabilities
   including automated guidance, trajectory following, and teleoperation;
   all of which require accurate estimates of the vehicle's body velocities
   and Euler angles. For larger rotorcraft that operate outdoors, the
   traditional approach is to combine a highly accurate IMU with GPS
   measurements. However, for small scale rotorcraft that operate indoors,
   lower quality MEMS IMUs are used because of limited payload. In indoor
   applications GPS is usually not available, and state estimates based on
   IMU measurements drift over time. In this paper, we propose a novel
   framework for state estimation that combines a dynamic flight model, IMU
   measurements, and 3D velocity estimates computed from an onboard
   monocular camera using computer vision. Our work differs from existing
   approaches in that, rather than using a single vision algorithm to
   update the vehicle's state, we capitalize on the strengths of multiple
   vision algorithms by integrating them into a meta-algorithm for 3D
   motion estimation. Experiments are conducted on two real helicopter
   platforms in a laboratory environment for different motion types to
   demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach.}},

Abstract = {{At the core of a biomanufacturing process for recombinant proteins is
   the production cell line. It influences the productivity and product
   quality. Its characteristics also dictate process development, as the
   process is optimized to complement the producing cell to achieve the

   vector design to cell line screening, have greatly expanded our
   capability to attain producing cell lines with certain desired traits.
   Increasing availability of genomic and transcriptomic resources for
   industrially important cell lines coupled with advances in genome
   editing technology have opened new avenues for cell line development.
   These developments are poised to help biosimilar manufacturing, which
   requires targeting pre-defined product quality attributes, e.g.,
   glycoform, to match the innovator's range. This review summarizes recent
   advances and discusses future possibilities in this area.}},

Title = {{Mass transfer studies across ventilated hydrofoils: A step towards
   hydroturbine aeration}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{512-520}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The water discharged by hydropower facilities is a matter of increasing
   concern due to poor downstream water quality. The use of auto-venting
   hydroturbines has been suggested as one of the best ways to mitigate low
   dissolved oxygen levels in the downstream water. Much of the design of
   auto-venting hydroturbines is currently performed with computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations. However, there is little information
   available to test and verify the performance of these simulations
   regarding gas transfer and bubble size distribution. This paper
   investigates the performance of a water tunnel test-bed for CFD
   simulations of an auto-venting hydroturbine through the use of a
   ventilated hydrofoil. Bubble size distributions are measured by a shadow
   imaging technique and found to have a Sauter mean diameter of 0.9 mm for
   a reference case. Higher liquid velocities, a lower airflow rate and a
   higher angle of attack all resulted in a greater number of small bubbles
   and a lower weighted mean bubble size. Bubble-water oxygen transfer is
   measured by the disturbed equilibrium technique. The gas transfer model
   of Azbel (1981) is utilized to characterize the liquid film coefficient
   for oxygen transfer, with one scaling coefficient to reflect the fact
   that characteristic turbulent velocity is replaced by cross-sectional
   mean velocity. The value of the coefficient is found to stay constant at
   a particular hydrofoil configuration while it varied over a narrow range
   of 0.52-0.60 for different hydrofoil angles of attack. This suggests
   that it is an appropriate coefficient for flow over a ventilated
   hydrofoil and possibly other flow situations. These results can be used
   by investigators to test and verify their CFD model against known bubble
   size distributions and gas transfer in a water tunnel flow that has
   important similarities to an auto-venting hydroturbine. (C) 2015

Title = {{Heat transfer augmentation of a channel flow by active agitation and
   surface mounted cylindrical pin fins}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{557-567}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{With the intent of enhancing heat transfer, agitation of air flow is
   produced inside a high-aspect-ratio rectangular channel by means of a
   translationally oscillating plate. So that the test simulates channel
   flow between fins of a heat sink for cooling of electronics, the channel
   is open at one end, allowing oscillatory inflow and outflow at that end.
   At the other end where the roots of the fins that constitute the heat
   sink channel walls reside, there is a gap between the moving agitator
   plate and the channel base. Local heat transfer rates and velocity
   measurements are made within different regions of the channel. Heat
   transfer measurements are made on a channel wall augmented with
   cylindrical pin fins. They compared with equivalent measurement results
   taken on a smooth wall channel. An increase of 4-7\%, based on total
   wetted area is found in the heat transfer coefficient, generally, when
   the pin fins are introduced. The change varies according to location
   within the channel, however. For instance, the heat transfer coefficient
   in the region near the base of the fins actually decreases 4-5\% (again,
   based on total wetted area) when the pin fins are added. In this region,
   the flow passing through a tip gap between the agitator tip and the
   channel base wall, creates strong vorticity and high near-wall shear.
   These features of the flow are partially blocked by the pin fins,
   decreasing the effectiveness of the vorticity. Important to note in
   these comparisons, however, is that the pin fins offer an additional
   30\% heat transfer area. To help explain the observed trends, velocity
   measurements were taken with a single-component laser Doppler anemometer
   in the presence of pin fins as well as in the absence of pin fins. Pin
   fins lead to a loss of near-wall momentum but create greater mixing and
   three dimensionality of the near-surface flow. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Variable displacement pumps are a key component to a variety of mobile
   and industrial hydraulic systems, yet the efficiency of existing pump
   architectures is poor at low displacement. As a solution to this issue,
   a new pump architecture is proposed that eliminates the planar
   hydrodynamic joints of a conventional architecture with rolling-element
   pin joints in an adjustable linkage. This new architecture uses an
   adjustable six-bar linkage that reaches true zero displacement and has
   the same top-dead-center (TDC) position regardless of displacement. In
   this work, the linkage kinematics and dynamics are discussed, an energy
   loss model is developed and used to drive design decisions of a first
   generation prototype, and experimental results are presented to validate
   the model. It is shown that this linkage-based, variable, positive
   displacement architecture shows promise as a highly efficient
   alternative to existing pump architectures across a wide range of
   displacements.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A novel approach using neuronal potential similarity (NPS) of two
   intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) electrodes placed over the foci
   is proposed for automated early seizure detection in patients with
   refractory partial epilepsy. The NPS measure is obtained from the
   spectral analysis of space-differential iEEG signals. Ratio between the
   NPS values obtained from two specific frequency bands is then
   investigated as a robust generalized measure, and reveals invaluable
   information about seizure initiation trends. A threshold-based
   classifier is subsequently applied on the proposed measure to generate
   alarms. The performance of the method was evaluated using
   cross-validation on a large clinical dataset, involving 183 seizure
   onsets in 1785 h of long-term continuous iEEG recordings of 11 patients.
   On average, the results show a high sensitivity of 86.9\% (159 out of
   183), a very low false detection rate of 1.4 per day, and a mean
   detection latency of 13.1 s from electrographic seizure onsets, while in
   average preceding clinical onsets by 6.3 s. These high performance
   results, specifically the short detection latency, coupled with the very
   low computational cost of the proposed method make it adequate for using
   in implantable closed-loop seizure suppression systems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a framework to efficiently assess the
   reliability of fault tolerant control systems on low-cost unmanned
   aerial vehicles. The analysis is developed for a system consisting of a
   fixed number of actuators. In addition, the system includes a scheme to
   detect failures in individual actuators and, as a consequence, switch
   between different control algorithms for automatic operation of the
   actuators. Existing dynamic reliability analysis methods are
   insufficient for this class of systems because the coverage parameters
   for different actuator failures can be time-varying, correlated, and
   difficult to obtain in practice. We address these issues by combining
   new fault detection performance metrics with pivotal decomposition.
   These new metrics capture the interactions in different fault detection
   channels, and can be computed from stochastic models of fault detection
   algorithms. Our approach also decouples the high dimensional analysis
   problem into low dimensional sub-problems, yielding a computationally
   efficient analysis. Finally, we demonstrate the proposed method on a
   numerical example. The analysis results are also verified by Monte Carlo
   simulations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sonoporation is a promising technology for promoting the transfer of
   drug or gene into cells using ultrasound-mediated microbubbles that
   transiently break up the cell membrane. In this article, a model is
   established to analyze the dynamics of ultrasound-mediated microbubble
   near the cell membrane, which may be especially useful for understanding
   the mechanisms of sonoporation. In the model, the velocity potential of
   fluid on the microbubble surface and on the cell membrane is obtained by
   the unsteady Bernoulli equations, and it is solved by using the boundary
   integral equations. By numerically analyzing the model, the typical
   microbubble dynamics near the cell membrane are enumerated, which may be
   mainly governed by mechanical index. The model also established the
   connections among the parameters of ultrasound exposure, microbubble
   characteristics, and cell membrane properties in sonoporation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, catalytic fast co-pyrolysis (co-CFP) of corn stalk and
   food waste (FW) was carried out to produce aromatics using quantitative
   pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and ZSM-5
   zeolite in the hydrogen form was employed as the catalyst. Co-CFP
   temperature and a parameter called hydrogen to carbon effective ratio
   (H/C-eff ratio) were examined for their effects on the relative content
   of aromatics. Experimental results showed that co-CFP temperature of 600
   degrees C was optimal for the formation of aromatics and other organic
   pyrolysis products. Besides, H/C-eff ratio had an important influence on
   product distribution. The yield of total organic pyrolysis products and
   relative content of aromatics increased non-linearly with increasing
   H/C-eff ratio. There was an apparent synergistic effect between corn
   stalk and FW during co-CFP process, which promoted the production of
   aromatics significantly. Co-CFP of biomass and FW was an effective
   method to produce aromatics and other petrochemicals. (C) 2015 Published

Abstract = {{A novel ride-through approach for matrix converters in adjustable speed

   energy from the spinning inertia of the motor to support the motor flux

   required to isolate the input filter capacitors from the collapsed grid
   voltages. The addition of input switches, a ride-through vector control
   strategy, and post fault reconnection logic are shown to enable
   ride-through of many cycle faults without the use of an additional
   energy storage device. In this paper, the control and reconnect
   strategies are discussed followed by simulations of the system and the
   presentation of experimental results. Through a short review of power
   quality assessments, it is shown that these improvements allow matrix
   converter-based adjustable speed drives to operate in a majority of real

Pages = {{4942-4950}},

Abstract = {{Ion gels formed with ABA triblock polymers and ionic liquids (IL) have
   recently attracted significant attention. Because of their high ionic
   conductivity, high capacitance, and good mechanical integrity, ion gels
   prepared from triblock polymers of polystyrene-b-poly(methyl
   methacrylate)-b-polystyrene (SMS) and polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene
   oxide)-b-polystyrene (SOS) and an IL 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ({[}EMI]{[}TFSI]) have been
   successfully applied as the dielectric layer in thin film transistors.
   However, water absorption can negatively affect the stability of the
   dielectric layer and lead to electrical breakdown. Consequently, the
   preferred polymer of these two is SMS. However, the high glass
   transition temperature (T-g) of PMMA limits the usable SMS polymer
   concentration in order to ensure comparable ionic conductivity to that
   of SOS ion gel; this constraint limits the modulus of the gel to about
   10(3) Pa. In this work, we developed a new ABA triblock ion gel system
   using poly(ethyl acrylate) (PEA) as a low T-g and hydrophobic midblock.
   The low T-g of the midblock ensures the ionic conductivity of the
   resulting ion gels is comparable to that of SOS ion gels at polymer
   concentrations up to 50 wt \%, which is a significant improvement
   relative to the currently used SMS ion gels. Additionally, by decreasing
   the size of the midblock at constant polymer concentration, the modulus
   and ionic conductivity of the ion gels increase synergistically. This
   interesting and counterintuitive effect reflects the concurrent increase
   in the number density and chain stretching of midblocks, accompanied by
   a net reduction in midblock concentration within the conducting phase.
   We demonstrate that electrolyte gated transistors (EGTs) made with SEAS
   ion gels have improved stability under ambient humid conditions in
   comparison to those made with SOS ion gels.}},

Title = {{Visualization of Miscanthus x giganteus cell wall deconstruction
   subjected to dilute acid pretreatment for enhanced enzymatic
   digestibility}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 25}},
Abstract = {{Background: The natural recalcitrance of lignocellulosic plant cell
   walls resulting from complex arrangement and distribution of
   heterogeneous components impedes deconstruction of such cell walls.
   Dilute acid pretreatment (DAP) is an attractive method to overcome the
   recalcitrant barriers for rendering enzymatic conversion of
   polysaccharides. In this study, the internodes of Miscanthus x
   giganteus, a model bioenergy crop, were subjected to DAP to yield a
   range of samples with altered cell wall structure and chemistry. The
   consequent morphological and compositional changes and their possible
   impact on saccharification efficiency were comprehensively investigated.
   The use of a series of microscopic and microspectroscopic techniques
   including fluorescence microscopy (FM), transmission electron microscopy
   (TEM) and confocal Raman microscopy (CRM)) enabled correlative cell wall
   structural and chemical information to be obtained.
   Results: DAP of M. x giganteus resulted in solubilization of
   arabinoxylan and cross-linking hydroxycinnamic acids in a
   temperature-dependent manner. The optimized pretreatment (1\% H2SO4, 170
   degrees C for 30 min) resulted in significant enhancement in the
   saccharification efficiency (51.20\%) of treated samples in 72 h, which
   amounted to 4.4-fold increase in sugar yield over untreated samples
   (11.80\%). The remarkable improvement could be correlated to a sequence
   of changes occurring in plant cell walls due to their
   pretreatment-induced deconstruction, namely, loss in the matrix between
   neighboring cell walls, selective removal of hemicelluloses,
   redistribution of phenolic polymers and increased exposure of cellulose.
   The consequently occurred changes in inner cell wall structure including
   damaging, increase of porosity and loss of mechanical resistance were
   also found to enhance enzyme access to cellulose and further sugar
   yield.
   Conclusions: DAP is a highly effective process for improving
   bioconversion of cellulose to glucose by breaking down the rigidity and
   resistance of cell walls. The combination of the most relevant
   microscopic and microanalytical techniques employed in this work
   provided information crucial for evaluating the influence of anatomical
   and compositional changes on enhanced enzymatic digestibility.}},

Abstract = {{Small protein ligands can provide superior physiological distribution

   scaffold to push the limits of small size and robust evolution of
   stable, high-affinity ligands: 45-residue T7 phage gene 2 protein (Gp2)
   contains an alpha helix opposite a beta sheet with two adjacent loops
   amenable to mutation. De novo ligand discovery from 10 8 mutants and
   directed evolution toward four targets yielded target-specific binders
   with affinities as strong as 200 +/- 100 pM, T(m)s from 65 degrees C +/-
   3 degrees C to 80 degrees C +/- 1 degrees C, and retained activity after
   thermal denaturation. For cancer targeting, a Gp2 domain for epidermal
   growth factor receptor was evolved with 18 +/- 8 nM affinity,
   receptor-specific binding, and high thermal stability with refolding.
   The efficiency of evolving new binding function and the size, affinity,

Abstract = {{The ability to tune polymer monolith porosity on multiple length scales
   is desirable for applications in liquid separations, catalysis, and
   bioengineering. To this end, we have developed a facile synthetic route
   :to nanoporous polymer monoliths based on controlled polymerization of
   styrene and divinylbenzene from a poly(lactide) macro-chain transfer
   agent in the presence of nonreactive poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). Simple
   variations in the volume fraction and/or molar mass of PEO lead to
   either polymerization-induced microphase separation or simultaneous
   macro- and microphase separation. These processes dictate the resultant
   morphology, and allow, for control of the macro- and microstructure of
   the monoliths. Subsequent selective etching produces monoliths with
   morphologies that can be tailored from mesoporous, with control over
   mesopore size, to hierarchically, meso- and macroporous, with
   percolating macropores. This convenient synthetic route to porous
   polymer monoliths has the potential to be useful in applications where
   both rapid mass transport and a high surface area are required.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{JUL 22}},
Abstract = {{Luminescent silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) have attracted tremendous
   research interest. Their size dependent photoluminescence (PL) shows
   great promise in various optoelectronic and biomedical applications and
   devices. However, it remains unclear why the exciton emission is limited
   to energy below 2.1 eV, no matter how small the nanocrystal is. Here we
   interpret a nanosecond transient yellow emission band at 590 nm (2.1 eV)
   as a critical limit of the wavelength tunability in colloidal silicon
   nanocrystals. In the ``large size{''} regime (d > similar to 3 nm),
   quantum confinement dominantly determines the PL wavelength and thus the
   PL peak blue shifts upon decreasing the Si NC size. In the ``small
   size{''} regime (d < similar to 2 nm) the effect of the yellow band
   overwhelms the effect of quantum confinement with distinctly increased
   nonradiative trapping. As a consequence, the photoluminescence peak does
   not exhibit any additional blue shift and the quantum yield drops
   abruptly with further decreasing the size of the Si NCs. This finding
   confirms that the PL originating from the quantum confined core states
   can only exist in the red/near infrared with energy below 2.1 eV; while
   the blue/green PL originates from surface related states and exhibits
   nanosecond transition.}},

Abstract = {{Two dimensional hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) attracted attention for
   use in applications. Using equilibrium molecular dynamics, we examine
   the phonon transport in few-layer h-BN encased by silica (SiO2). We
   report large interfacial thermal resistances, of about 2.2 x 10(-8) m(2)
   K W-1, which are not sensitive to the number of h-BN layers or the SiO2
   crystallinity. The h-BN/SiO2 superlattices exhibit ultra-low thermal
   conductivities across layers, as low as 0.3 W/m K. They are structurally
   stable up to 2000 K while retaining the low-thermal conductivity
   attributes. Our simulations indicate that incorporation of h-BN layers
   and nanoparticles in silica could establish thermal barriers and heat
   spreading paths, useful for high performance coatings and electronic
   device applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are versatile nanoporous materials that
   have gained significant interest as low heat capacity, high selectivity
   sorbents for CO2 capture applications. Large-scale atomistic simulations
   for identifying high-performance MOFs are possible, but are limited to
   systems for which existing molecular mechanics force fields describe the
   interactions between the guest and framework atoms with sufficient
   accuracy. However, standard force fields are not applicable to cases
   involving coordinatively unsaturated metal centers that can strongly
   bind specific sorbate molecules. It has been previously shown that
   improved force fields can be derived from quantum mechanical
   calculations. In this work, we derived force fields for an isostructural
   series of MOFs, M-MOF-74, where M = Mn, Co, Ni, and Cu, from first
   principles. Monte Carlo calculations in the Gibbs ensemble were used to
   calculate the CO2 adsorption isotherms in order to assess the quality of
   the derived force field parameters and to determine a generally
   applicable procedure for obtaining a reliable force field for a targeted
   MOF and adsorbate system. The computed CO2 adsorption isotherms for the
   different M-MOF-74 members agree with experimental measurements at low
   loading and show that Ni-MOF-74 possesses the highest affinity toward
   CO2 and Cu-MOF-74 the weakest. In addition, we explored the source of
   open metal site and pore inaccessibility in these materials and
   quantified its impact on adsorption, especially the discrepancies often
   observed between experiments and simulations at high loadings.}},

Abstract = {{Blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) is the signature injury of
   the recent Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Here, we present a novel method to
   induce bTBI using shock wave (SW) lithotripsy. Using a lithotripsy
   machine, Wistar rats (N=70; 408.3 +/- 93g) received five SW pulses to
   the right side of the frontal cortex at 24kV and a frequency of 60Hz.
   Animals were then randomly divided into three study endpoints: 24h
   (n=25), 72h (n=19) and 168h (n=26). Neurological and behavioral
   assessments (Garcia's test, beam walking, Rotarod, and elevated plus
   maze) were performed at the baseline, and further assessments followed
   at 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168h post-injury, if applicable. We performed
   digital subtraction angiography (DSA) to assess presence of cerebral
   vasospasm due to induced bTBI. Damage to brain tissue was assessed by an
   overall histological severity (OHS) score based on depth of injury, area
   of hemorrhage, and extent of axonal injury. Except for beam walking, OHS
   was significantly correlated with the other three outcome measures with
   at least one of their assessments during the first 6h after the
   experiment. OHS manifested the highest absolute correlation coefficients
   with anxiety at the baseline and 6h post-injury (r(baseline)=-0.75,
   r(6hrs)=0.85; p<0.05). Median hemispheric differences for contrast peak
   values (obtained from DSA studies) for 24, 72, and 168h endpoints were
   3.45\%, 3.05\% and 0.2\%, respectively, with statistically significant
   differences at 1 versus 7d (p<0.05) and 3 versus 7d (p<0.01). In this
   study, we successfully established a preclinical rat model of bTBI with
   characteristics similar to those observed in clinical cases. This new
   method may be useful for future investigations aimed at understanding
   bTBI pathophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Genes in prokaryotic genomes are often arranged into clusters and
   co-transcribed into polycistronic RNAs. Isolated examples of
   polycistronic RNAs were also reported in some higher eukaryotes but
   their presence was generally considered rare. Here we developed a
   long-read sequencing strategy to identify polycistronic transcripts in
   several mushroom forming fungal species including Plicaturopsis crispa,
   Phanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor, and Gloeophyllum
   trabeum. We found genome-wide prevalence of polycistronic transcription
   in these Agaricomycetes, involving up to 8\% of the transcribed genes.
   Unlike polycistronic mRNAs in prokaryotes, these co-transcribed genes
   are also independently transcribed. We show that polycistronic
   transcription may interfere with expression of the downstream tandem
   gene. Further comparative genomic analysis indicates that polycistronic
   transcription is conserved among a wide range of mushroom forming fungi.
   In summary, our study revealed, for the first time, the genome
   prevalence of polycistronic transcription in a phylogenetic range of
   higher fungi. Furthermore, we systematically show that our long-read
   sequencing approach and combined bioinformatics pipeline is a generic
   powerful tool for precise characterization of complex transcriptomes
   that enables identification of mRNA isoforms not recovered via
   short-read assembly.}},

Abstract = {{During vesicle budding or endocytosis, biomembranes undergo a series of
   lipid- and protein-mediated deformations involving cholesterol-enriched
   lipid rafts. If lipid rafts of high bending rigidities become confined
   to the incipient curved membrane topology such as a bud-neck interface,
   they can be expected to reform as ring-shaped rafts. Here, we report on
   the observation of a disk-to-ring shape morpho-chemical transition of a
   model membrane in the absence of geometric constraints. The raft shape
   transition is triggered by lateral compositional heterogeneity and is
   accompanied by membrane deformation in the vertical direction, which is
   detected by height-sensitive fluorescence interference contrast
   microscopy. Our results suggest that a flat membrane can become curved
   simply by dynamic changes in local chemical composition and shape
   transformation of cholesterol-rich domains.}},

Abstract = {{We report the systematic characterization of anisotropic, pi-conjugated
   oligophenyleneimine (OPI) films synthesized using stepwise imine
   condensation, or click chemistry. Film synthesis began with a
   self-assembled monolayer (SAM) of 4-formylthiophenol or
   4-aminothiophenol on Au, followed by repetitive, alternate addition of
   terephthalaldehyde (benzene-1,4-dicarbaldehyde) or 1,4-benzenediamine to
   form pi-conjugated films ranging from 0.6-5.5 nm in thickness. By
   systematically capping the OPI films with a redox or halogen label, we
   were able to measure the relative surface coverage after each monomer
   addition via Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy, spectroscopic ellipsometry, reflection-absorption infrared
   spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry. Nuclear reaction analysis was also
   employed for the first time on a SAM to calculate the surface coverage
   of carbon atoms after each stepwise addition. These six different
   analysis methods indicate that the average extent of reaction is 99\%
   for each addition step. The high yield and molecular surface coverage
   confirm the efficacy of Schiff base chemistry, at least with the
   terephthalaldehyde and 1,4-benzenediamine monomers, for preparing
   high-quality molecular films with p conjugation normal to the substrate.}},

Title = {{Subject-specific computational modeling of DBS in the PPTg area}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus
   (PPTg) has been proposed to alleviate medically intractable gait
   difficulties associated with Parkinson's disease. Clinical trials have
   shown somewhat variable outcomes, stemming in part from surgical
   targeting variability, modulating fiber pathways implicated in side
   effects, and a general lack of mechanistic understanding of DBS in this
   brain region. Subject-specific computational models of DBS are a
   promising tool to investigate the underlying therapy and side effects.
   In this study, a parkinsonian rhesus macaque was implanted unilaterally
   with an 8-contact DBS lead in the PPTg region. Fiber tracts adjacent to
   PPTg, including the oculomotor nerve, central tegmental tract, and
   superior cerebellar peduncle, were reconstructed from a combination of
   pre-implant 71 MRI, post-implant CT, and post-mortem histology. These
   structures were populated with axon models and coupled with a finite
   element model simulating the voltage distribution in the surrounding
   neural tissue during stimulation. This study introduces two empirical
   approaches to evaluate model parameters. First, incremental monopolar
   cathodic stimulation (20 Hz, 90 mu s pulse width) was evaluated for each
   electrode, during which a right eyelid flutter was observed at the
   proximal four contacts (-1.0 to 1.4 mA). These current amplitudes
   followed closely with model predicted activation of the oculomotor nerve
   when assuming an anisotropic conduction medium. Second, PET imaging was
   collected OFF-DBS and twice during DBS (two different contacts), which
   supported the model predicted activation of the central tegmental tract
   and superior cerebellar peduncle. Together, subject-specific models
   provide a framework to more precisely predict pathways modulated by DBS.}},

Abstract = {{Utilization of new hierarchical zeolites comprised of small crystallites
   (<50 nm) provides enhanced processing rates in separation and catalytic
   applications. However, molecular permeation through surface pores in
   small zeolite crystals has been shown to control the overall rate,
   resulting in apparent site-to-site intracrystalline kinetics that vary
   by as much as three orders of magnitude. In this work, the external
   surface of small zeolite MFI crystals was characterized by combining
   experimental kinetics and molecular simulation to evaluate the
   hypothesis of a two-dimensional distribution of surface pores that are
   either open or closed (i.e., fraction, p(open)). The movement of benzene
   through the MFI lattice and surface was evaluated with a discrete space
   kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm with varying particle sizes (1.0 nm <= R
   <= 640 nm) and fraction of surface pore openings (10(-4) < p(open) <
   10(0)). Introduction of randomly distributed surface pore blockages was
   shown to increase the molecular path length for adsorbates exiting the
   particle while maintaining a constant apparent activation energy,
   consistent with additional molecular motion near the internal surface.
   Comparison of the dimensionless surface barrier (lambda =
   tau(Surface)/tau(Bulk)) obtained by simulation to experimental
   measurements (zero length chromatography) for silicalite-1 particles (62
   nm to 3 mu m, 50-110 degrees C) reveals that the vast majority (>99.9\%)
   of surface pores must be blocked (p(open) < 10(-3)) to justify the
   observed surface permeation rate of hydrocarbon adsorbates.}},

Month = {{JUL 14}},
Abstract = {{The processing and performance of Schottky diodes formed from arrays of
   vertical Ge nanowires (NWs) grown on Ge and Si substrates are reported.
   The goal of this work is to investigate CMOS compatible processes for
   integrating NWs as components of vertically scaled integrated circuits,
   and elucidate transport in vertical Schottky NWs. Vertical phosphorus
   (P) doped Ge NWs were grown using vapor-liquid-solid epitaxy, and nickel
   (Ni)-Ge Schottky contacts were made to the tops of the NWs.
   Current-voltage (I-V) characteristics were measured for variable ranges
   of NW diameters and numbers of nanowires in the arrays, and the I-V
   characteristics were fit using modified thermionic emission theory to
   extract the barrier height and ideality factor. As grown NWs did not
   show rectifying behavior due to the presence of heavy P side-wall doping
   during growth, resulting in a tunnel contact. After sidewall etching
   using a dilute peroxide solution, rectifying behavior was obtained.
   Schottky barrier heights of 0.3-0.4V and ideality factors close to 2
   were extracted using thermionic emission theory, although the model does
   not give an accurate fit across the whole bias range. Attempts to
   account for enhanced side-wall conduction due to non-uniform P doping
   profile during growth through a simple shunt resistance improve the fit,
   but are still insufficient to provide a good fit. Full three-dimensional
   numerical modeling using Silvaco Atlas indicates that at least part of
   this effect is due to the presence of fixed charge and acceptor like
   traps on the NW surface, which leads to effectively high ideality
   factors. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the effect of added polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene
   oxide) (SO) copolymer on the stability of oil-in-oil (O/O) emulsions
   containing polystyrene (PS) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) in
   chloroform (CHCl3) and directly visualized the location of SO in the
   emulsions by using dye-labeled SO (SO{*}) with confocal laser scanning
   microscopy (CLSM). The emulsion formed by PS/PEG/CHCl3 = 14/6/80 (wt \%)
   consisted of a droplet phase of PS in CHCl3 and a continuous phase
   containing PEG in CHCl3. SO{*}s with various molecular weights
   (M-n,M-SO) and volume fractions of the PS block in SO (f(PS)) were
   prepared via living anionic polymerization and subsequent
   end-esterification. The effect of SO on the droplet size in the
   emulsions was investigated as a function of both M-n,M-SO and f(PS).
   Increasing M-n,M-SO and decreasing f(PS) were effective at reducing the
   droplet size down to less than 1 mu m, which is 100 times smaller than
   in the absence of SO. The location of SO{*}s in the O/O emulsions was
   further investigated by CLSM. We found that the location of SO{*}s
   changed from the droplet interior to the liquid-liquid interface and
   then to the continuous phase with decreasing f(PS). We discuss the
   possible mechanism in terms of the relation of SO{*} location to the
   droplet size.}},

Abstract = {{The crystallization and mechanical properties of triblock and multiblock
   copolymers containing 70 vol \% semicrystalline poly(L-lactide) (L) and
   30 vol \% rubbery poly(ethylene-co-ethylene) (E/E-E) were investigated.
   The multiblock copolymer was synthesized directly from the triblock
   copolymer (denoted LE/EEL). Specifically, the dihydroxyl-terminated
   LE/EEL served as a macromonomer in a step-growth polymerization in which
   stoichiometric quantities of sebacoyl chloride were added, resulting in
   (LE/EEL)(< 3.6 >), a multiblock copolymer with an average of 3.6
   triblock copolymer units connected together. Additionally, triblock and
   multiblock copolymers were blended together in order to systematically
   tune < n > and uncover the role of block number on properties. Dynamic
   mechanical analysis (DMA) indicated that despite differences in < n >,
   all samples had an order-to-disorder transition temperature T-ODT
   approximate to 190 degrees C, which is above the melting temperature
   (T-m) of poly(L-lactide). Small-angle X-ray scattering measurements
   (SAXS) of the block copolymers at T-m < T < T-ODT showed that the
   samples had identical morphology (hexagonally packed cylinders) and
   domain spacing. Isothermal crystallization experiments were performed
   using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and indicated that samples
   with higher < n > had a lower percentage crystallinity after 1 h of
   crystallization, which we associate with the differences in the average
   chain architecture. Uniaxial tensile measurements demonstrate a
   brittle-to-ductile transition at < n > = 1.8 for specimens with limited
   crystallinity. Finally, the effect of crystallinity on mechanical
   properties was investigated by annealing select samples.}},

Abstract = {{Organomodified clays are known to be effective in polymer blend
   compatibilization if located preferentially at the domain interfaces,
   but little is known regarding the origin of their localization. In this
   study, we investigate the effect of organomodifier, clay loading, and
   shear environment on the compatibilization extent in nonreactive
   polyethylene (LDPE)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and reactive maleic
   anhydride functional polyethylene (PE-g-MA)/PEO polymer blends. We pose
   important questions: If clay is to compatibilize blends by interfacial
   localization, how does organomodifier affect its localization? How does
   an increase in clay loading affect the shape and elasticity of the
   interface? What is the shear intensity needed to overcome the
   equilibrium distribution of clays and delaminate it from the interface?
   We utilize laser scanning confocal microscopy and 3D image analysis to
   calculate characteristic phase size and gain unique insights into the
   connection between the clay loading and the interfacial curvature. Our
   experiments demonstrate that 1 wt \% of interfacially localized clay is
   sufficient to suppress coarsening and greatly reduce phase domains.
   However, further increase of clay loading only saw a marginal reduction
   in phase size compared to 1 wt \% clay loading. The interfacial
   curvature calculations showed that with increase in clay loadings beyond
   1 wt \% the shape of the interface does not change significantly;
   however, slight broadening of curvature distribution and increasing
   asymmetry are observed from 3D images. This can be attributed to the
   multiple layers of clay jammed at the interface at higher clay loadings.
   When reactive PE-g-MA was substituted for LDPE, graft copolymers were
   generated via in situ coupling at the interface. These copolymers
   combined with clay resulted in the smallest phase domains. In addition,
   we show that clay dispersion and localization were largely independent
   of shear intensity, which suggests that clay does not delaminate from
   the interface even in high shear environments.}},

Abstract = {{Two series of polyolefin-based bottlebrush polymers were synthesized
   using- ring-opening metathesis polymerization of
   norbomenyl-functionalized macromonomers to compare the rheology of
   systems with and without the presence of side chain entanglement. The
   first series of bottlebrushes includes atactic polypropylene (aPP)
   branches with a fixed length of M-branch = 2.05 kg/mol and variable
   backbone degree of polymerization ranging from 11 to 732 (M-w = 22-1500
   kg/mol). The branches in this series are shorter than the entanglement
   molecular weight of aPP (M-branch/M-e approximate to 0.5) The second
   series utilizes poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) (PEP) branches with
   M-branch = 6.7 kg/mol and variable backbone degree of polymerization
   ranging from 13 to 627 (M-w = 89-4200 kg/mol). The branches in this
   series exceed the entanglement molecular weight of PEP (M-branch/M-e
   approximate to 3.5). The linear viscoelastic responses of each sample
   were examined using small-amplitude oscillatory shear measurements, and
   dynamic master curves were constructed by time temperature
   superposition. Master curves of all aPP bottlebrush polymers exhibited
   relaxation spectra devoid of any entanglement plateau, despite their
   high molecular weight. Master curves of the PEP bottlebrushes displayed
   rubbery plateau regions at short relaxation times, indicating successful
   entanglement formation between PEP branches. The scaling behavior of the
   master curves reveals a transient power law scaling throughout the
   relaxation process. The dynamics are more Zimm-like a early relaxation
   times and become increasingly Rouse-like at long relaxation times. This
   transition arises due to the changing conformational character of
   bottlebrushes at different length scales. Finally, plots of the phase
   angle versus complex modulus revealed additional intrinsic
   characteristics of the bottlebrush polymers: (0 the presence of two
   distinct relaxation processes corresponding to the motion of side chains
   and of the backbone and (ii) the onset of thermorheological complexity
   as the glass transition temperature was approached. These two
   observations represent inherent material properties that are
   individually governed by the macromolecular architecture and by the
   monomer scale chemistry, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Relaxation calorimetry experiments were used to measure the temperature
   dependence of the heat capacity near the order disorder phase transition
   (ODT) in a low molecular weight) volumetrically symmetric,
   lamellae-forming, poly(1,4-isoprene-b-DL-lactide) diblock copolymer with
   M-n. = 2750 g/mol (dispersity (D) over bar = 1.10) and composition
   f(PLA) = 0.51. This enabled accurate determination of the latent heat of
   the ODT, yielding a value Delta H-ODT = 0.26 +/- 0.02 J/g, consistent
   with previous measurements using differential scanning calorimetry. The
   relatively small magnitude of the latent heat supports the results of
   recent molecular simulations and reinforces the importance of
   composition fluctuations on the thermodynamics of block polymers near
   the ODT. These thermal measurements reveal no signature of the
   fluctuation effects in the disordered state as T -> T-ODT, consistent
   with previous experimental and theoretical work, which supports the
   notion that composition fluctuations develop over a relatively wide
   range of temperatures for T > T-ODT. The finite width of the heat
   capacity peak, Delta T-ODT approximate to 1 degrees C, is shown to be
   consistent with molecular dispersity. These measurements demonstrate the
   utility of relaxation calorimetry as a quantitative semistatic thermal
   characterization tool for block polymers in the vicinity of phase
   transitions.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular interactions can be modeled as complex dynamical systems
   represented by weighted graphs. The functionality of such networks,
   including measures of robustness, reliability, performance, and
   efficiency, are intrinsically tied to the topology and geometry of the
   underlying graph. Utilizing recently proposed geometric notions of
   curvature on weighted graphs, we investigate the features of gene
   co-expression networks derived from large-scale genomic studies of
   cancer. We find that the curvature of these networks reliably
   distinguishes between cancer and normal samples, with cancer networks
   exhibiting higher curvature than their normal counterparts. We establish
   a quantitative relationship between our findings and prior
   investigations of network entropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our
   approach yields additional, non-trivial pair-wise (i.e. gene-gene)
   interactions which may be disrupted in cancer samples. The mathematical
   formulation of our approach yields an exact solution to calculating
   pair-wise changes in curvature which was computationally infeasible
   using prior methods. As such, our findings lay the foundation for an
   analytical approach to studying complex biological networks.}},

Abstract = {{Spectral-beam-combining (SBC) systems utilizing multiple volume Bragg
   gratings must be carefully analyzed to maximize channel density and
   efficiency, and thus output radiance. This analysis grows increasingly
   difficult as the number of channels in the system increases, and
   heuristic optimization techniques are useful tools for exploring the
   limits of these systems. We explore three classes of multigrating SBC
   systems: cascaded, where each grating adds a new channel to the system
   in sequence; sandwiched, where several individual gratings are placed
   together and all channels enter the system at the same facet; and
   multiplexed, where all of the gratings occupy the same holographic
   optical element (HOE). Loss mechanisms differ among these three basic
   classes, and our optimization algorithm shows that the highest channel
   density for a given minimum efficiency and fixed operating bandwidth is
   achieved for a cascaded grating system. The multiplexed grating system
   exhibits the lowest channel density under the same constraints but has
   the distinct advantage of being realized by a single HOE. For a
   particular application, one must weigh channel density and efficiency
   versus system complexity when choosing among these basic classes of SBC
   systems. Additionally, one may need to consider the effects of
   finite-width input beams. As input beam radius is reduced, angular
   clipping effects begin to dominate over spectral interference and
   crosstalk effects, limiting all three classes of SBC systems in a
   similar manner. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{HIV-1 and HIV-2 exhibit similar mutation frequencies and spectra in the
   absence of G-to-A hypermutation}},
Journal = {{RETROVIROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV-2) is often
   distinguished clinically by lower viral loads, reduced transmissibility,
   and longer asymptomatic periods than for human immunodeficiency virus
   type 1 (HIV-1). Differences in the mutation frequencies of HIV-1 and
   HIV-2 have been hypothesized to contribute to the attenuated progression
   of HIV-2 observed clinically.
   Results: To address this hypothesis, we performed Illumina sequencing of
   multiple amplicons prepared from cells infected with HIV-1 or HIV-2,
   resulting in similar to 4.7 million read pairs and the identification of
   similar to 200,000 mutations after data processing. We observed that:
   (1) HIV-2 displayed significantly lower total mutation, substitution,
   and transition mutation frequencies than that of HIV-1, along with a
   mutation spectrum markedly less biased toward G-to-A transitions, (2)
   G-to-A hypermutation consistent with the activity of APOBEC3 proteins
   was observed for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 despite the presence of Vif, (3)
   G-to-A hypermutation was significantly higher for HIV-1 than for HIV-2,
   and (4) HIV-1 and HIV-2 total mutation frequencies were not
   significantly different in the absence of G-to-A hypermutants.
   Conclusions: Taken together, these data demonstrate that HIV-2 exhibits
   a distinct mutational spectrum and a lower mutation frequency relative
   to HIV-1. However, the observed differences were primarily due to
   reduced levels of G-to-A hypermutation for HIV-2. These findings suggest
   that HIV-2 may be less susceptible than HIV-1 to APOBEC3-mediated
   hypermutation, but that the fidelities of other mutational sources (such
   as reverse transcriptase) are relatively similar for HIV-1 and HIV-2.
   Overall, these data imply that differences in replication fidelity are
   likely not a major contributing factor to the unique clinical features
   of HIV-2 infection.}},

Abstract = {{This study deciphers the topological sensitivity (TS) as a tool for the
   reconstruction and characterization of impenetrable anomalies in the
   high-frequency regime. It is assumed that the anomaly is simply
   connected and convex, and that the measurements of the scattered field
   are of the far-field type. In this setting, the formula for TS-which
   quantifies the perturbation of a cost functional due to a point-like
   impenetrable scatterer-is expressed as a pair of nested surface
   integrals: one taken over the boundary of a hidden obstacle, and the
   other over the measurement surface. Using multipole expansion, the
   latter integral is reduced to a set of antilinear forms featuring
   Green's function and its gradient. The remaining expression is distilled
   by evaluating the scattered field on the surface of an obstacle via
   Kirchhoff approximation, and pursuing an asymptotic expansion of the
   resulting Fourier integral. In this way, the TS is found to survive upon
   three asymptotic lynchpins, namely (i) the near-boundary approximation
   for sampling points close to the `exposed' surface of an obstacle; (ii)
   uniform expansions synthesizing the diffraction catastrophes for
   sampling points near caustic surfaces, lines and points; and (iii)
   stationary phase approximation. Within the framework of catastrophe
   theory, it is shown that, in the case of the full source aperture, the
   TS is asymptotically dominated by the (explicit) near-boundary
   term-which explains the previously reported reconstruction capabilities
   of this class of indicator functionals. The analysis further shows that,
   when the (Dirichlet or Neumann) character of an anomaly is unknown
   beforehand, the latter can be effectively exposed by assuming point-like
   Dirichlet perturbation and considering the sign of the leading term
   inside the reconstruction.}},

Abstract = {{Electrospray ionization (ESI) is the preferred mode of ion generation
   for mass analysis of many organic species, as alternative ionization
   techniques can lead to appreciable analyte fragmentation. For this
   reason, ESI is an ideal method for the analysis of species within
   aerosol particles. However, because of their low concentrations (similar
   to 10 mu g/m(3)) in most environments, ESI has been applied sparingly in
   aerosol particle analysis; aerosol mass spectrometers typically employ
   analyte volatilization followed by electron ionization or chemical
   ionization, which can lead to a considerable degree of analyte
   fragmentation. Here, we describe an approach to apply ESI to
   submicrometer and nanometer scale aerosol particles, which utilizes
   unipolar ionization to charge particles, electrostatic precipitation to
   collect particles on the tip of a Tungsten rod, and subsequently, by
   flowing liquid over the rod, ESI and mass analysis of the species
   composing collected particles. This technique, which we term
   electrostatic precipitation-ESI-MS (EP-ESI-MS), is shown to enable
   analysis of nanogram quantities of collected particles (from aerosol
   phase concentrations as low as 10(2) ng m(-3)) composed of cesium
   iodide, levoglucosan, and levoglucosan within a carbon nanoparticle
   matrix. With EP-ESI-MS, the integrated mass spectrometric signals are
   found to be a monotonic function of the mass concentration of analyte in
   the aerosol phase. We additionally show that EP-ESI-MS has a dynamic
   range of close to 5 orders of magnitude in mass, making it suitable for
   molecular analysis of aerosol particles in laboratory settings with
   upstream particle size classification, as well as analysis of PM 2.5
   particles in ambient air.}},

Abstract = {{Landscape evolution theory suggests that climate sets the scale of
   landscape dissection by modulating the competition between diffusive
   processes that sculpt convex hillslopes and advective processes that
   carve concave valleys. However, the link between the relative dominance
   of hillslope and valley transport processes and landscape scale is
   difficult to demonstrate in natural landscapes due to the episodic
   nature of erosion. Here, we report results from laboratory experiments
   combining diffusive and advective processes in an eroding landscape. We
   demonstrate that rainsplash-driven disturbances in our experiments are a
   robust proxy for hillslope transport, such that increasing hillslope
   transport efficiency decreases drainage density. Our experimental
   results demonstrate how the coupling of climate-driven hillslope- and
   valley-forming processes, such as bioturbation and runoff, dictates the
   scale of eroding landscapes.}},

   The results show that the scanner can provide high spatiotemporal

   0.25 ms/B-scan; similar to 8.5 x 5.5 mu m(2) in xz). The advantage of
   this method compared to monitoring a single depth profile z is a
   dramatic increase in the number of available sites that can be measured

   Evaluation of TeensTalkHealth}},
Journal = {{JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{Background: Different theoretical frameworks support the use of
   interactive websites to promote sexual health. Although several
   Web-based interventions have been developed to address sexual risk
   taking among young people, no evaluated interventions have attempted to
   foster behavior change through moderated interaction among a virtual
   network of adolescents (who remain anonymous to one another) and health
   professionals.
   Objective: The objective was to conduct a summative process evaluation
   of TeensTalkHealth, an interactive sexual health website designed to
   promote condom use and other healthy decision making in the context of
   romantic and sexual relationships.
   Methods: Evaluation data were obtained from 147 adolescents who
   participated in a feasibility and acceptability study. Video vignettes,
   teen-friendly articles, and other content served as conversation
   catalysts between adolescents and health educators on message boards.
   Results: Adolescents' perceptions that the website encouraged condom use
   across a variety of relationship situations were very high. Almost 60\%
   (54/92, 59\%) of intervention participants completed two-thirds or more
   of requested tasks across the 4-month intervention. Adolescents reported
   high levels of comfort, perceived privacy, ease of website access and
   use, and perceived credibility of health educators. Potential strategies
   to enhance engagement and completion of intervention tasks during future
   implementations of TeensTalkHealth are discussed, including tailoring of
   content, periodic website chats with health educators and anonymous
   peers, and greater incorporation of features from popular social
   networking websites.
   Conclusions: TeensTalkHealth is a feasible, acceptable, and promising
   approach to complement and enhance existing services for youth.}},

Title = {{A granularity model for balancing the structural complexity of
   manufacturing systems equipment and layout}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{7-19}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The structural complexity of a manufacturing system results primarily
   from the complexity of its equipment and their layout. The balance
   between both complexity sources can be achieved by searching for the
   best system granularity level, which yields a manufacturing system with
   the least overall structural complexity. A new system granularity
   complexity index is developed to sum up and normalize the complexity
   resulting from the system layout complexity and the equipment structural
   complexity. A previously developed layout complexity index together with
   a code-based structural complexity assessment are used to determine the
   structural complexity of standalone pieces of equipment and to arrive at
   a balance between the two sources of complexity. Cladistics analysis is
   used to hierarchically cluster required pieces of equipment and bundle
   them into more integrated equipment and machines and demonstrate the
   possible different system granularity levels. The new developed model is
   a useful tool to create specific system configuration and layout
   alternatives based on system components adjacency, and then select the
   system design with the least overall structural complexity among those
   alternatives. The results of the presented case study clearly
   demonstrated this trade-off where decomposing manufacturing systems into
   a highly granular configuration with standalone machines maximizes
   system layout complexity and minimizes equipment complexity, while at a
   low level of granularity pieces of equipment are bundled into complex
   integrated machines, lines or cells but with a very simple system
   layout. (C) 2015 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers. Published by

Abstract = {{A receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) algorithm is presented
   for extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based global navigation satellite
   system receivers. To this end, a novel method to bound the EKF mean
   position error is developed under the assumption of step and ascending
   ramp fault profiles. The calculated mean position error bound is
   subsequently used to determine EKF protection levels. Simulation results
   show that the EKF RAIM algorithm offers performance comparable to that
   of the traditional weighted least squares RAIM. Although performance
   gains may not be achieved, the proposed approach lays the foundation for
   efficient, real-time computation of protection levels for range
   residual-based RAIM with EKF. Thus, it has important extensions to
   advanced EKF-based navigation algorithms, such as vector tracking
   receivers.}},

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{River deltas belong to the most densely settled places on earth.
   Although they only account for 5\% of the global land surface, over 550
   million people live in deltas. These preferred livelihood locations,
   which feature flat terrain, fertile alluvial soils, access to fluvial
   and marine resources, a rich wetland biodiversity and other advantages
   are, however, threatened by numerous internal and external processes.
   Socio-economic development, urbanization, climate change induced sea
   level rise, as well as flood pulse changes due to upstream water
   diversion all lead to changes in these highly dynamic systems. A
   thorough understanding of a river delta's general setting and
   intra-annual as well as long-term dynamic is therefore crucial for an
   informed management of natural resources. Here, remote sensing can play
   a key role in analyzing and monitoring these vast areas at a global
   scale. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential of
   intra-annual time series analyses at dense temporal, but coarse spatial
   resolution for inundation characterization in five river deltas located
   in four different countries. Based on 250 m MODIS reflectance data we
   analyze inundation dynamics in four densely populated Asian river
   deltas-namely the Yellow River Delta (China), the Mekong Delta
   (Vietnam), the Irrawaddy Delta (Myanmar), and the Ganges-Brahmaputra
   (Bangladesh, India)-as well as one very contrasting delta: the nearly
   uninhabited polar Mackenzie Delta Region in northwestern Canada for the
   complete time span of one year (2013). A complex processing chain of
   water surface derivation on a daily basis allows the generation of
   intra-annual time series, which indicate inundation duration in each of
   the deltas. Our analyses depict distinct inundation patterns within each
   of the deltas, which can be attributed to processes such as overland
   flooding, irrigation agriculture, aquaculture, or snowmelt and
   thermokarst processes. Clear differences between mid-latitude,
   subtropical, and polar deltas are illustrated, and the advantages and
   limitations of the approach for inundation derivation are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the future, Earth will be warmer, precipitation events will be more
   extreme, global mean sea level will rise, and many arid and semiarid
   regions will be drier. Human modifications of landscapes will also occur
   at an accelerated rate as developed areas increase in size and
   population density. We now have gridded global forecasts, being
   continually improved, of the climatic and land use changes (C\&LUC) that
   are likely to occur in the coming decades. However, besides a few
   exceptions, consensus forecasts do not exist for how these C\&LUC will
   likely impact Earth-surface processes and hazards. In some cases, we
   have the tools to forecast the geomorphic responses to likely future
   C\&LUC. Fully exploiting these models and utilizing these tools will
   require close collaboration among Earth-surface scientists and
   Earth-system modelers. This paper assesses the state-of-the-art tools
   and data that are being used or could be used to forecast changes in the
   state of Earth's surface as a result of likely future C\&LUC. We also
   propose strategies for filling key knowledge gaps, emphasizing where
   additional basic research and/or collaboration across disciplines are
   necessary. The main body of the paper addresses cross-cutting issues,
   including the importance of nonlinear/threshold-dominated interactions
   among topography, vegetation, and sediment transport, as well as the
   importance of alternate stable states and extreme, rare events for
   understanding and forecasting Earth-surface response to C\&LUC. Five
   supplements delve into different scales or process zones (global-scale
   assessments and fluvial, aeolian, glacial/periglacial, and coastal
   process zones) in detail.}},

Abstract = {{Structural characterization of protein-protein interactions at molecular
   level is essential to understand biological processes and identify new
   therapeutic opportunities. However, atomic resolution structural
   techniques cannot keep pace with current advances in interactomics.
   Low-resolution structural techniques, such as small-angle X-ray
   scattering (SAXS), can be applied at larger scale, but they miss atomic
   details. For efficient application to proteinprotein complexes,
   low-resolution information can be combined with theoretical methods that
   provide energetic description and atomic details of the interactions.
   Here we present the pyDockSAXS web server
   (http://life.bsc.es/pid/pydocksaxs) that provides an automatic pipeline
   for modeling the structure of a protein-protein complex from SAXS data.
   The method uses FTDOCK to generate rigid-body docking models that are
   subsequently evaluated by a combination of pyDock energy-based scoring
   function and their capacity to describe SAXS data. The only required
   input files are structural models for the interacting partners and a
   SAXS curve. The server automatically provides a series of structural
   models for the complex, sorted by the pyDockSAXS scoring function. The
   user can also upload a previously computed set of docking poses, which
   opens the possibility to filter the docking solutions by potential
   interface residues or symmetry restraints. The server is freely
   available to all users without restriction.}},

Abstract = {{Cogeneration, also known as combined heat and power, is the simultaneous
   generation of electric and thermal energy from the same fuel source.
   Some proven benefits of cogeneration are much higher efficiencies than
   conventional power generation and its ability to facilitate distributed
   energy and lower energy costs. Also, when cogeneration is fueled with
   wood biomass, there are additional environmental benefits such as using
   a renewable energy source and lower greenhouse gas emissions. However,
   only a small number of wood product manufacturers (North American
   Industry Classification System codes 321 and 337) have adopted this
   technology. In this study, drivers, perceptions, and barriers for
   cogeneration were investigated to gain understanding of the reasons for
   the low adoption of this technology among wood product manufacturers.
   Interviews of experts and companies were conducted to identify and
   understand major topics of cogeneration adoption within the industry.
   Subsequently, a nonprobability, target survey of nonadopters was carried
   out to identify operational characteristics, perceptions about benefits
   of cogeneration, and bathers to its implementation. Findings show that
   economies of scale and coincidence between thermal and electric loads
   are some of the major factors for cogeneration feasibility. Main bathers
   identified were the initial investment and complexity, companies'
   return-on-investment requirements, utility tariff policies, and
   inadequate policies and incentives. Another major finding was a lack of
   awareness and knowledge about cogeneration, which presents organizations
   that support the forest products industry with an opportunity to provide
   education and outreach. However, because of the small sample size (52
   responses), generalization of these results to the population of
   interest is not feasible.}},

Abstract = {{Computational methods and tools that can efficiently and effectively
   analyze the temporal changes in dynamic complex relational networks
   enable us to gain significant insights regarding the entity relations
   and their evolution. This article introduces a new class of dynamic
   graph patterns, referred to as coevolving relational motifs (CRMs),
   which are designed to identify recurring sets of entities whose
   relations change in a consistent way over time. CRMs can provide
   evidence to the existence of, possibly unknown, coordination mechanisms
   by identifying the relational motifs that evolve in a similar and highly
   conserved fashion. We developed an algorithm to efficiently analyze the
   frequent relational changes between the entities of the dynamic networks
   and capture all frequent coevolutions as CRMs. Our algorithm follows a
   depth-first exploration of the frequent CRM lattice and incorporates
   canonical labeling for redundancy elimination. Experimental results
   based on multiple real world dynamic networks show that the method is
   able to efficiently identify CRMs. In addition, a qualitative analysis
   of the results shows that the discovered patterns can be used as
   features to characterize the dynamic network.}},

   favor of delta X-2 similar to D-0 using uncertainty at the 95\%

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The pairing of helical tip vortices in the wake of a two-bladed rotor is
   investigated experimentally. Time-resolved particle image velocimetry
   measurements provide a clear temporal and spatial evolution of the
   vortical structures, highlighting the transition to instability and the
   effect of tip speed ratio and helical spacing. The temporal growth rate
   of the vortex system instabilities were measured and are shown to be
   dependent on helical spacing. The evolution of filaments and their
   growth rates support the argument that the mutual inductance mode is the
   driving mechanism behind the transition to an unstable wake. The
   measurements are in agreement with maximum growth rates predicted by
   linear stability analyses of single- and double-helix arrangements. In
   addition, the wake topology due to varying rotor load through tip speed
   ratio variation is shown to play an important role in the initial
   symmetry breaking that drives the wake transition.}},

Abstract = {{Mesaconate is an intermediate in the glutamate degradation pathway of
   microorganisms such as Clostridium tetanomorphum. However, metabolic
   engineering to produce mesaconate has not been reported previously. In
   this work, two enzymes involved in mesaconate production, glutamate
   mutase and 3-methylaspartate ammonia lyase from C. tetanomorphum, were
   recombinantly expressed in Escherichia cob. To improve mesaconate
   production, reactivatase of glutamate mutase was discovered and
   adenosylcobalamin availability was increased. In addition, glutamate
   mutase was engineered to improve the in vivo activity. These efforts led
   to efficient mesaconate production at a titer of 7.81 g/L in shake flask
   with glutamate feeding. Then a full biosynthetic pathway was constructed
   to produce mesaconate at a titer of 6.96 g/L directly from glucose. In
   summary, we have engineered an efficient system in E. coli for the
   biosynthesis of mesaconate. (C) 2015 International Metabolic Engineering

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The phagocyte oxidative burst, mediated by Nox2 NADPH oxidase-derived
   reactive oxygen species, confers host defense against a broad spectrum
   of bacterial and fungal pathogens. Loss-of-function mutations that
   impair function of the Nox2 complex result in a life-threatening
   immunodeficiency, and genetic variants of Nox2 subunits have been
   implicated in pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Thus,
   alterations in the oxidative burst can profoundly impact host defense,
   yet little is known about regulatory mechanisms that fine-tune this
   response. Here we report the discovery of regulatory nodes controlling
   oxidative burst by functional screening of genes within loci linked to
   human inflammatory disease. Implementing a multi-omics approach, we
   define transcriptional, metabolic and ubiquitin-cycling nodes controlled
   by Rbpj, Pfkl and Rnf145, respectively. Furthermore, we implicate Rnf145
   in proteostasis of the Nox2 complex by endoplasmic reticulum-associated
   degradation. Consequently, ablation of Rnf145 in murine macrophages
   enhances bacterial clearance, and rescues the oxidative burst defects
   associated with Ncf4 haploinsufficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has introduced a
   ``bundled payments for care improvement{''} (BPCI) initiative. Each
   bundle pertains to a specific medical condition, a set of linked
   services, and a length of time referred to as an episode of care.
   Proposers choose bundles, design service chains, and propose target
   values of quality metrics and payments per episode. Expert panels
   evaluate proposals based on CMS-announced relative weights, but there is
   no limit on the number of proposers that may be selected. Moreover,
   there is no minimum score that will guarantee selection, which makes
   selection uncertain for proposers. We develop normative models for the
   parameter selection problems faced by potential proposers within the
   CMS' proposal selection process. Proposers have private information
   about their costs of achieving different quality targets, which
   determine their equilibrium responses. We show that an optimal strategy
   for CMS, under its current approach, may be to either announce a fixed
   threshold or keep the selection process uncertain, depending on market
   characteristics. We also formulate and solve the proposer selection
   problem as a constrained mechanism design problem, which reveals that
   CMS' current approach is not optimal. We present policy guidelines for
   government agencies pursuing bundled payment innovations.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Motivated by the need to improve fundamental understanding of the
   coating of discrete objects, the influence of surfactants on the flow of
   thin liquid films around rotating cylinders is considered in this work.
   The lubrication approximation is applied to derive three coupled
   nonlinear evolution equations describing the variation of the film
   thickness, surfactant surface concentration, and surfactant bulk
   concentration as a function of time and the angular coordinate. In the
   absence of gravitational effects, linear stability analysis reveals that
   Marangoni stresses suppress the growth rate of instabilities driven by
   centrifugal forces and hinder the leveling of perturbations to the film
   thickness. When gravitational effects are present, Marangoni stresses
   lower the critical rotation rate needed to cause motion of a liquid lobe
   around the cylinder. These stresses also lead to faster damping of
   oscillations in the film thickness at relatively short times, but if
   strong enough, it can increase the oscillation amplitude at longer
   times. In all cases examined, surfactant solubility has the effect of
   weakening the influence of Marangoni stresses. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Collagen IV networks in the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) are
   essential for the maintenance and regulation of blood filtration in the
   kidneys. The GBM contains two different types of collagen IV networks:
   {[}alpha 1(IV)](2)alpha 2(IV) and alpha 3(IV)alpha 4(IV)alpha 5(IV), the
   latter of which has a higher number of supercoils (two or more collagens
   coiling around each other). To investigate the effects of supercoiling
   on the mechanical and permeability properties of collagen IV networks,
   we generated model collagen IV networks in the GBM and reconnected them
   to create different levels of supercoiling. We found that supercoiling
   greatly increases the stiffness of collagen IV networks but only
   minimally decreases the permeability. Also, doubling the amount of
   supercoils in a network had a bigger effect than doubling the stiffness
   of the supercoils. Our results suggest that the formation of supercoils
   is a specialized mechanism by the GBM that provides with a network stiff
   and strong enough to withstand the high hydrostatic pressures of
   filtration, yet porous enough that filtration is not hindered.
   Clinically, understanding the effects of supercoiling gives us insight
   into the mechanisms of GBM failure in some disease states where the
   normal collagen IV structure is disrupted.}},

Abstract = {{A winding design approach is proposed for the bearingless ac homopolar
   and consequent pole motors that utilizes the same coils for both
   suspension force and torque production. This enables a ``pure{''}
   bearingless motor design, where the same iron and copper are used for
   both magnetic bearing operation and torque production, and can result in
   more optimal machine performance. Separate terminal connections are
   provided for suspension and torque operation; the suspension terminals
   experience no motional-emf when the rotor is centered, thereby reducing
   the required voltage rating of the bearingless drive compared to other
   ``dual purpose{''} winding designs. It is shown that only certain
   combinations of stator slots, phases, and poles yield suitable winding
   designs; most notably, the number of motor pole-pairs must be co-prime
   with the number of phases. A design procedure is proposed which allows
   the designer to simply modify end-connections of many conventional
   armature windings, including both integral- and fractional-slot
   windings; an example winding design is presented and analyzed using 3-D
   finite element analysis (FEA); and a hardware prototype has been
   constructed with experimental results included to validate the proposed
   design approach.}},

Title = {{Mining Patterns Associated With Mobility Outcomes in Home Healthcare}},

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background Mobility is critical for self-management. Understanding
   factors associated with improvement in mobility during home healthcare
   can help nurses tailor interventions to improve mobility outcomes and
   keep patients safely at home.
   Objectives The aims were to (a) identify patient and support system
   factors associated with mobility improvement during home care, (b)
   evaluate consistency of factors across groups defined by mobility status
   at the start of home care, and (c) identify patterns of factors
   associated with improvement and no improvement in mobility within each
   group.
   Methods Outcome and Assessment Information Set data extracted from a
   national convenience sample of 270,634 patient records collected from
   October 1, 2008 to December 31, 2009 from 581 Medicare-certified, home
   healthcare agencies were used. Patients were placed into groups based on
   mobility scores at admission. Odds ratios were used to index
   associations of factors with improvement at discharge. Discriminative
   pattern mining was used to discover patterns associated with improvement
   of mobility.
   Results Overall, mobility improved for 49.4\% of patients; improvement
   occurred most frequently (80\%) among patients who were able, at
   admission, to walk only with the supervision or assistance of another
   person at all times. Numerous factors associated with improvement in
   mobility outcome were similar across the groups (except for those who
   were chairfast but were able to wheel themselves independently);
   however, the number, strength, and direction of associations varied. In
   most groups, data mining-discovered patterns of factors associated with
   the mobility outcome were composed of combinations of functional and
   cognitive status and the type and amount of help required at home.
   Discussion This study provides new data mining-based information about
   how factors associated with improvement in mobility group together and
   vary by mobility at admission. These approaches have potential to
   provide new insights for clinicians to tailor interventions for
   improvement of mobility.}},

Abstract = {{The turnover frequency (TOF) of benzene synthesis from vapor phase
   anisole hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), estimated via in situ CO titration,
   was found to be invariant (1.1 +/- 0.3 X 10(-3) s(-1)) over molybdenum
   carbide (Mo2C) catalysts with varying CO chemisorption uptakes (similar
   to 70 to similar to 260 mu mol g(-1), measured ex situ at 323 K).
   Accumulation of oxygen (similar to 0.29 monolayer) over Mo2C catalysts
   was determined by an oxygen mass balance during the transient of anisole
   HDO at 423 K under ambient pressure (H-2/anisole molar ratio similar to
   110). Similar product selectivity, apparent activation energy, and TOF
   of benzene synthesis for an oxygen treated (with oxygen incorporation:
   O/Mo-bulk (molar ratio) = 0.075) and freshly prepared Mo2C catalysts (no
   exposure to air prior to kinetic measurements) demonstrate that the
   effect of oxygen at these low concentrations is solely to reduce the
   number of active sites for anisole HDO, resulting in a lower (similar to
   3 times) benzene synthesis rate per gram of catalyst for the
   oxygen-modified material. The observed benzene synthesis rates per CO
   chemisorption site for bulk molybdenum oxide (MoOx) catalysts were found
   to be similar to 10 times lower than those for Mo2C catalysts,
   suggesting that bulk molybdenum oxide phases are not associated with the
   dominant active sites for anisole HDO at 423 K under ambient pressure.}},

Abstract = {{The productivity of cell culture manufacturing for biologics has
   increased momentously in the past decades. Increasingly, the process
   research efforts are devoted into improving product quality and
   consistency. Consistent process performance and successful
   implementation of quality by design practice requires well-utilized
   process analytical technology. This review summarizes recent progress
   and current status of bioprocess monitoring. Many sensors for bioprocess
   monitoring have been available for decades while new ones, especially
   spectrometric sensors, are making their way into cell culture
   bioprocesses. On-line sampling devices have grown mature in the past
   decade thus making many instruments traditionally used for off-line
   analysis available for at-line use. With a general trend of using better
   defined medium for cell cultivation and increasing emphasis of process
   analytical tools, the spectrometric methods are also making headway in
   cell culture process monitoring. The integration of those sensing

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a strategy for the detection and triangulation of
   localized anomalies, such as defects, inclusions, or damage zones, in
   solid and structural media. The method revolves around the construction
   of sparse representations of the structure's ultrasonic wavefield
   response, which are obtained by learning instructive dictionaries that
   form a suitable basis for the response data. The resulting sparse coding
   problem is cast as a modified dictionary learning task with additional
   spatial sparsity constraints enforced on the atoms of the learned
   dictionaries, which provide them with the ability to unveil anomalous
   regions in the physical domain. The proposed methodology is
   model-agnostic, i.e., it forsakes the need for a physical model and
   requires virtually no a priori knowledge of the material properties.
   This characteristic makes the approach especially powerful for anomaly
   identification in systems with unknown or highly heterogeneous property
   distribution, for which a material model is unsuitable or unreliable.
   The method is tested against synthetically generated data as well as
   experimental data acquired using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer.}},

   most discriminatory information for severity of parkinsonian motor
   signs. Prediction errors <20\% were achievable using 28 of the possible
   206 features tested. For all subjects, a spectral feature within the
   beta band was chosen through the feature selection algorithm, but a
   combination of features, including alpha-band power and phase-amplitude
   coupling, was necessary to achieve minimal prediction errors. There was
   large variability between the discriminatory features for individual
   subjects, and testing of classifiers between subjects yielded prediction
   errors >50\%. These results suggest that pallidal oscillations can be
   predictive biomarkers of parkinsonian severity, but the features are
   more complex than spectral power in individual frequency bands, such as
   the beta band. Additionally, the best feature set was subject specific,
   which highlights the pathophysiological heterogeneity of parkinsonism
   and the importance of subject specificity when designing closedloop
   system controllers dependent on such features.}},

Abstract = {{Stress development in coatings prepared from aqueous suspensions of hard
   particles was monitored using a modified cantilever deflection technique
   that suppresses lateral drying fronts. Without complications from
   lateral drying, stress development was found to be negligible until a
   critical amount of drying when stress increases dramatically to a
   maximum and then falls more slowly as drying completes. In addition, the
   maximum stress measured for coatings prepared on the modified
   cantilevers was more than double the maximum stress for coatings
   measured on standard cantilevers where lateral drying fronts were
   present. By achieving drying uniformity, direct correlations were made
   between the microstructure of the coating and the measured coating
   stress. Cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryoSEM) was used to
   image the microstructure of aqueous alumina and silica particle coatings
   during the intermediate stages of drying. CryoSEM revealed that stress
   increases dramatically once the particles form a saturated close-packed
   network, and that stress decays as water evaporates from the pore
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{The use of pyrite FeS2 as an earth-abundant, low-cost, nontoxic thin
   film photovoltaic hinges on improved understanding and control of
   certain physical and chemical properties. Phase stability, phase purity,
   stoichiometry, and defects, are central in this respect, as they are
   frequently implicated in poor solar cell performance. Here, phase-pure
   polycrystalline pyrite FeS2 films, synthesized by ex situ sulfidation,
   are subject to systematic reduction by vacuum annealing (to 550 degrees
   C) to assess phase stability, stoichiometry evolution, and their impact
   on transport. Bulk probes reveal the onset of pyrrhotite (Fe1-dS) around
   400 degrees C, rapidly evolving into the majority phase by 425 degrees
   C. This is supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy on (001)
   crystals, revealing surface Fe1-dS formation as low as 160 degrees C,
   with rapid growth near 400 degrees C. The impact on transport is
   dramatic, with Fe1-dS minority phases leading to a crossover from
   diffusive transport to hopping (due to conductive Fe1-dS nanoregions in
   an FeS2 matrix), followed by metallicity when Fe1-dS dominates. Notably,
   the crossover to hopping leads to an inversion of the sign, and a large
   decrease in magnitude of the Hall coefficient. By tracking resistivity,
   magnetotransport, magnetization, and structural/chemical parameters vs
   annealing, we provide a detailed picture of the evolution in properties
   with stoichiometry. A strong propensity for S-deficient minority phase
   formation is found, with no wide window where S vacancies control the
   FeS2 carrier density. These findings have important implications for
   FeS2 solar cell development, emphasizing the need for (a) nanoscale
   chemical homogeneity, and (b) caution in interpreting carrier types and
   densities.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of monolayer single-crystalline graphene (SCG) using the

   operate at a pull-in voltage as low as 1 V, with switch time in the
   nanosecond regime. Owing to their single-crystalline nature, the
   switches' lifetime (> 5000 times) is much longer than that of
   polycrystalline graphene ones reported. The RF devices exhibit good
   isolation (-30 dB at 40 GHz (Ka band)), which can be further improved by

Abstract = {{The capability to accurately simulate thermally stratified environments
   highly depends on the numerical model which governs the physical
   problem, but also on the temporal and spatial discretization resolution.
   This paper presents a multi-resolution Cartesian mesh refinement method
   for solving the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, while the
   standard k-epsilon turbulence model is employed to resolve stratified
   turbulent flows. Hanging nodes are used to facilitate the implementation
   of high order discretization schemes and the algebraic system of the
   discretized differential equations is solved with a generic modified
   Alternating Direction Implicit (m-ADI) method developed to resolve
   locally refined grids. The overall performance of the new flow solver is
   initially evaluated against experimental data related to the laminar
   flow past a square cylinder for Reynolds numbers, defined based on the
   mean ambient wind speed and the characteristic length scale, of 87 <= Re
   <= 250 and neutral thermal stratification. The unsteady character of the
   flow field is successfully predicted and the grid refinement approach
   enables accurate low cost and low blockage simulations. The flow solver
   is applied to simulate the flow over thermally stratified idealized
   urban areas. Good agreement with experimental measurements, where the
   bulk Richardson number was defined based on the mean wind speed at the
   top of the reference street canyon, is obtained for -0.21 <= R-b <= 0.78
   while the grid refinement method allowed simulation of the experimental
   setup in detail, including all the roughness elements and the idealized
   street canyons. The numerical calculations indicate that even weak
   thermal stability can lead to laminarization of the induced flow field;
   reducing at the same time the potential for air mixing and results to
   air degradation. Even though the recirculation patterns are influenced
   under weak thermal stratification, extreme thermal instability within
   the region of -16 <= R-b <= -64 with Re= 6800 results to the development
   of two counter-rotating vortices of equivalent kinetic energy. However,
   the linear correlation of the average kinetic energy at the roof-level
   with the R-b number indicates that the buoyancy forces determine the air
   mixing levels. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to quantitatively characterize anatomy
   of the human phrenic nerve in relation to the coronary venous system, to
   reduce undesired phrenic nerve stimulation during left-sided lead
   implantations. We obtained CT scans while injecting contrast into
   coronary veins of 15 perfusion-fixed human heart-lung blocs. A
   radiopaque wire was glued to the phrenic nerve under CT, then we created
   three-dimensional models of anatomy and measured anatomical parameters.
   The left phrenic nerve typically coursed over the basal region of the
   anterior interventricular vein, mid region of left marginal veins, and
   apical region of inferior and middle cardiac veins. There was large
   variation associated with the average angle between nerve and veins.
   Average angle across all coronary sinus tributaries was fairly
   consistent (101.3 degrees-111.1 degrees). The phrenic nerve coursed
   closest to the middle cardiac vein and left marginal veins. The phrenic
   nerve overlapped a left marginal vein in >50\% of specimens. Clin. Anat.

Abstract = {{In 3-D ICs, through silicon via (TSV)-induced thermal residual stress
   impacts several transistor electrical parameters-low-field mobility,
   saturation velocity, and threshold voltage. These thermal-stress related
   shifts are coupled with other temperature effects on transistor
   parameters that are seen even in the absence of TSVs. In this paper,
   analytical models are developed to holistically represent the effect of
   thermally-induced variations on circuit timing. A biaxial stress model
   is built, based on a superposition of 2-D axisymmetric and
   Boussinesq-type elasticity models. The computed stresses and strains are
   then employed to evaluate transistor mobility, saturation velocity, and
   threshold voltage. The electrical variations are translated into
   gate-level delay and leakage power calculations, which are then elevated
   to circuit-level analysis to thoroughly evaluate the variations in
   circuit performance-induced by TSV stress.}},

Title = {{Iterative Vessel Segmentation of Fundus Images}},

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1738-1749}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel unsupervised iterative blood vessel
   segmentation algorithm using fundus images. First, a vessel enhanced
   image is generated by tophat reconstruction of the negative green plane
   image. An initial estimate of the segmented vasculature is extracted by
   global thresholding the vessel enhanced image. Next, new vessel pixels
   are identified iteratively by adaptive thresholding of the residual
   image generated by masking out the existing segmented vessel estimate
   from the vessel enhanced image. The new vessel pixels are, then, region
   grown into the existing vessel, thereby resulting in an iterative
   enhancement of the segmented vessel structure. As the iterations
   progress, the number of false edge pixels identified as new vessel
   pixels increases compared to the number of actual vessel pixels. A key
   contribution of this paper is a novel stopping criterion that terminates
   the iterative process leading to higher vessel segmentation accuracy.
   This iterative algorithm is robust to the rate of new vessel pixel
   addition since it achieves 93.2-95.35\% vessel segmentation accuracy
   with 0.9577-0.9638 area under ROC curve (AUC) on abnormal retinal images
   from the STARE dataset. The proposed algorithm is computationally
   efficient and consistent in vessel segmentation performance for retinal
   images with variations due to pathology, uneven illumination,
   pigmentation, and fields of view since it achieves a vessel segmentation
   accuracy of about 95\% in an average time of 2.45, 3.95, and 8 s on
   images from three public datasets DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB1,
   respectively. Additionally, the proposed algorithm has more than 90\%
   segmentation accuracy for segmenting peripapillary blood vessels in the
   images from the DRIVE and CHASE\_DB1 datasets.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The influence of viscoelasticity on the emptying of liquids from model
   gravure cells is studied via numerical simulations. The simulations use
   a finite-element/front-tracking method, and viscoelastic effects are
   described with the FENE-P model. Two different model configurations
   featuring moving contact lines are considered. In the first, there is a
   free surface and an outlet boundary, and the liquid is driven out of a
   cavity by a combination of horizontal substrate motion and an imposed
   pressure gradient. In the second, there are two free surfaces, and the
   liquid is driven out of the cavity through both horizontal and vertical
   substrate motion. For the first configuration, it is found that
   viscoelasticity aids cavity emptying through gradients in the first
   normal stress difference that are generated by the relative motion of
   the substrate and cavity. For the second configuration, vertical
   substrate motion promotes cavity emptying, with the effect enhanced when
   viscoelasticity is present. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Concrete Structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a technique for computing the time-dependent
   behavior of reinforced and prestressed concrete as a composite material.
   This technique, when implemented in a finite-element model and assuming
   that the concrete and steel reinforcement act as a composite material,
   is computationally advantageous compared with explicitly modeling the
   concrete and steel materials separately. The method is developed
   assuming linear viscoelasticity and uncracked sections. The approach
   starts by first approximating the creep compliance functions for the
   viscoelastic concrete as a Kelvin chain model. This approximation allows
   the viscoelastic behavior to be framed as a rate-type creep law, which
   converts the analysis to an equivalent elastic problem, simplifying the
   computations. This approach, originally developed for plain concrete, is
   extended in this paper to account for the effects of linear elastic
   reinforcement. Several implementation examples are provided documenting
   the viability of the method for problems of uniaxial, multiaxial, and
   bending behaviors. For the presented cases, the composite method is
   shown to provide similar results compared with models containing
   explicitly modeled reinforcement. The paper concludes with a discussion
   regarding how to extend the methodology to the general case with linear
   viscoelastic reinforcement and matrix materials.}},

Volume = {{279}},
Pages = {{123-126}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Using a compaction simulator, it has been shown that tablet ejection
   force increases with increasing tableting speed during compression of
   powders lubricated with 1\% magnesium stearate. Faster tableting speed
   corresponds to higher coefficient of friction, A but does not affect
   residual radial die wall (RDW) stress. The higher mu suggests the
   presence of less lubricant at the tablet-die wall interface due to the
   shorter time available for migration of lubricant to the interface. This
   mechanism can also explain the sudden occurrence of powder sticking
   problem upon formulation scale up. The elevated ejection force due to
   higher mu also results in higher RDW stress at the moment of slip
   initiation, which proportionally increases ejection force. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Azotobacter vinelandii is a widely studied model diazotrophic
   (nitrogen-fixing) bacterium and also an obligate aerobe, differentiating
   it from many other diazotrophs that require environments low in oxygen
   for the function of the nitrogenase. As a free-living bacterium, A.
   vinelandii has evolved enzymes and transporters to minimize the loss of
   fixed nitrogen to the surrounding environment. In this study, we pursued
   efforts to target specific enzymes and further developed screens to
   identify individual colonies of A. vinelandii producing elevated levels
   of extracellular nitrogen. Targeted deletions were done to convert urea
   into a terminal product by disrupting the urease genes that influence
   the ability of A. vinelandii to recycle the urea nitrogen within the
   cell. Construction of a nitrogen biosensor strain was done to rapidly
   screen several thousand colonies disrupted by transposon insertional
   mutagenesis to identify strains with increased extracellular nitrogen
   production. Several disruptions were identified in the ammonium
   transporter gene amtB that resulted in the production of sufficient
   levels of extracellular nitrogen to support the growth of the biosensor
   strain. Further studies substituting the biosensor strain with the green
   alga Chlorella sorokiniana confirmed that levels of nitrogen produced
   were sufficient to support the growth of this organism when the medium
   was supplemented with sufficient sucrose to support the growth of the A.
   vinelandii in coculture. The nature and quantities of nitrogen released
   by urease and amtB disruptions were further compared to strains reported
   in previous efforts that altered the nifLA regulatory system to produce
   elevated levels of ammonium. These results reveal alternative approaches
   that can be used in various combinations to yield new strains that might
   have further application in biofertilizer schemes.}},

   selects from its list of neighbours, a set of 20 nodes to be contacted;

   closest to every peer in the network. This allows the malicious peer to
   bias next-hop choices for victim peers such that queries will be sent to

Abstract = {{Boron-doped resistors and transistors were developed using various
   levels of boron concentration. These were exposed to a thermal neutron
   flux of about 2 x 10(8) s(-1) cm(-2) at various fluences, at Los Alamos
   National Laboratory. Characterization of some electrical properties was
   carried out before and after irradiation. The reaction, B-10 + n -> Li +
   alpha, and others, caused by neutron irradiation, introduced impurities
   in the silicon lattice, thus producing measurable differences in
   electronic parameters. The results show that for irradiated resistors
   possessing very low values of boron concentration (approximate to 10(14)
   cm(-3)), there is a significant reduction (i.e., orders of magnitude) in
   resistivity, for the higher fluences studied (2 x 10(11)-10(12) cm(-2)).
   This trend is not seen for high values of boron concentration
   (approximate to 10(21) cm(-3)), nor for the low- boron-concentration
   specimens exposed to a lower fluence. These observations appear to be in
   accordance with the deep-trap level behavior, and, though requiring
   further study, they seem to be promising for the potential application
   on neutron radiation detection. Additionally, there was no observation
   of significant changes in other electronic parameters, such as threshold
   voltage or trans-conductance, for the transistors exposed and tested.}},

Abstract = {{Continuous culture for the production of biopharmaceutical proteins
   offers the possibility of steady state operations and thus more
   consistent product quality and increased productivity. Under some
   conditions, multiplicity of steady states has been observed in
   continuous cultures of mammalian cells, wherein with the same dilution
   rate and feed nutrient composition, steady states with very different
   cell and product concentrations may be reached. At those different
   steady states, cells may exhibit a high glycolysis flux with high
   lactate production and low cell concentration, or a low glycolysis flux
   with low lactate and high cell concentration. These different steady
   states, with different cell concentration, also have different
   productivity. Developing a mechanistic understanding of the occurrence
   of steady state multiplicity and devising a strategy to steer the
   culture toward the desired steady state is critical. We establish a
   multi-scale kinetic model that integrates a mechanistic intracellular
   metabolic model and cell growth model in a continuous bioreactor. We
   show that steady state multiplicity exists in a range of dilution rate
   in continuous culture as a result of the bistable behavior in
   glycolysis. The insights from the model were used to devise strategies
   to guide the culture to the desired steady state in the multiple steady
   state region. The model provides a guideline principle in the design of
   continuous culture processes of mammalian cells. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},

Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{7, SI}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Understanding user needs and preferences is increasingly recognized as a
   critical component of early stage product development. The large-scale
   needfinding methods in this series of studies attempt to overcome
   shortcomings with existing methods, particularly in environments with
   limited user access. The three studies evaluated three specific types of
   stimuli to help users describe higher quantities of needs. Users were
   trained on need statements and then asked to enter as many need
   statements and optional background stories as possible. One or more
   stimulus types were presented, including prompts (a type of thought
   exercise), shared needs, and shared context images. Topics used were
   general household areas including cooking, cleaning, and trip planning.
   The results show that users can articulate a large number of needs
   unaided, and users consistently increased need quantity after viewing a
   stimulus. A final study collected 1735 needs statements and 1246 stories
   from 402 individuals in 24 hr. Shared needs and images significantly
   increased need quantity over other types. User experience (and not
   expertise) was a significant factor for increasing quantity, but may not
   warrant exclusive use of high-experience users in practice.}},

Abstract = {{This study introduces a technique that characterizes the spatial
   distribution of peripheral membrane proteins that associate reversibly
   with the plasma membrane. An axial scan through the cell generates a
   z-scan intensity profile of a fluorescently labeled peripheral membrane
   protein. This profile is analytically separated into membrane and
   cytoplasmic components by accounting for both the cell geometry and the
   point spread function. We experimentally validated the technique and
   characterized both the resolvability and stability of z-scan
   measurements. Furthermore, using the cellular brightness of green
   fluorescent protein, we were able to convert the fluorescence
   intensities into concentrations at the membrane and in the cytoplasm. We
   applied the technique to study the translocation of the pleckstrin
   homology domain of phospholipase C delta 1 labeled with green
   fluorescent protein on ionomycin treatment. Analysis of the z-scan
   fluorescence profiles revealed protein-specific cell height changes and
   allowed for comparison between the observed fluorescence changes and
   predictions based on the cellular surface area-to-volume ratio. The
   quantitative capability of z-scan fluorescence profile deconvolution
   offers opportunities for investigating peripheral membrane proteins in
   the living cell that were previously not accessible. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{Impact of fluid-mover characteristics on heat exchanger performance: A
   new reality-based analysis approach}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{581-588}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The performance of convective heat transfer devices is necessarily
   linked to the characteristics of the participating fluid flow. The most
   common connection between the heat transfer and the fluid flow is by
   means of the Reynolds number. However, the Reynolds number provides very
   limited information about the nature of the fluid flow that is conveyed
   to the beat exchange device by the fluid mover. Other highly relevant
   features of the fluid presented to the inlet of the device include
   steadiness, uniformity, unidirectionality, and flow regime. These
   characteristics are highly dependent on the type of the participating
   fluid mover. In both the published heat transfer literature as well in
   traditional thermal design modalities, these and other fluid flow issues
   are virtually absent. Consequently, device-specific heat transfer
   results are presented without any reference to the fluid-mover and to
   the nature of the flow that it provides. The goal of the present
   research is to demonstrate that this traditional approach to heat
   transfer analysis and design may give rise to significant errors. It is
   demonstrated that the performance of a heat transfer device may be
   strongly impacted by the nature of the flow provided to it by the
   specific participating fluid mover. In such situations, the performance
   of the heat transfer device is actually the result of the performance of
   a system consisting of the device and the fluid mover. The conclusions
   set forth here are based on numerical simulations of a reality model
   which meticulously models an actual rotating fan and a multi-member fin
   array. A second model, designated as the baseline case, utilizes the
   best available literature model to obtain heat transfer results for
   comparison with those from the reality model. The baseline model follows
   the traditional approach of ignoring the actual attributes of the
   fan-delivered flow. It was found that the baseline model overestimates
   the heat transfer rate by almost a factor of two. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{525-565}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in localization techniques have fundamentally enhanced
   social networking services, allowing users to share their locations and
   location-related contents, such as geo-tagged photos and notes. We refer
   to these social networks as location-based social networks (LBSNs).
   Location data bridges the gap between the physical and digital worlds
   and enables a deeper understanding of users' preferences and behavior.
   This addition of vast geo-spatial datasets has stimulated research into
   novel recommender systems that seek to facilitate users' travels and
   social interactions. In this paper, we offer a systematic review of this
   research, summarizing the contributions of individual efforts and
   exploring their relations. We discuss the new properties and challenges
   that location brings to recommender systems for LBSNs. We present a
   comprehensive survey analyzing 1) the data source used, 2) the
   methodology employed to generate a recommendation, and 3) the objective
   of the recommendation. We propose three taxonomies that partition the
   recommender systems according to the properties listed above. First, we
   categorize the recommender systems by the objective of the
   recommendation, which can include locations, users, activities, or
   social media. Second, we categorize the recommender systems by the
   methodologies employed, including content-based, link analysis-based,
   and collaborative filtering-based methodologies. Third, we categorize
   the systems by the data sources used, including user profiles, user
   online histories, and user location histories. For each category, we
   summarize the goals and contributions of each system and highlight the
   representative research effort. Further, we provide comparative analysis
   of the recommender systems within each category. Finally, we discuss the
   available data-sets and the popular methods used to evaluate the
   performance of recommender systems. Finally, we point out promising
   research topics for future work. This article presents a panorama of the
   recommender systems in location-based social networks with a balanced
   depth, facilitating research into this important research theme.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new Bayesian approach to the inverse problem of
   passive microwave rainfall retrieval. The proposed methodology {[}called
   the shrunken locally linear embedding algorithm for retrieval of
   precipitation (ShARP)] relies on a regularization technique and makes
   use of two joint dictionaries of coincident rainfall profiles and their
   corresponding up-welling spectral radiative fluxes. A sequential
   detection-estimation strategy is adopted, which basically assumes that
   similar rainfall intensity values and their spectral radiances live
   close to some sufficiently smooth manifolds with analogous local
   geometry. The detection step employs a nearest neighbor classification
   rule, whereas the estimation scheme is equipped with a constrained
   shrinkage estimator to ensure the stability of retrieval and some
   physical consistency. The algorithm is examined using coincident
   observations of the active precipitation radar and the passive microwave
   imager onboard the TRMM satellite. We present promising results of
   instantaneous rainfall retrieval for some tropical storms and mesoscale
   convective systems over ocean, land, and coastal zones. We provide
   evidence that the algorithm is capable of properly capturing different
   storm morphologies including high-intensity rain cells and trailing
   light rainfall, particularly over land and coastal areas. The algorithm
   is also validated at an annual scale for calendar year 2013 versus the
   standard (version 7) radar (2A25) and radiometer (2A12) rainfall
   products of the TRMM satellite.}},

Abstract = {{Quadratically constrained quadratic programs QCQPs) have a wide range of
   applications in signal processing and wireless communications.
   Non-convex QCQPs are NP-hard in general. Existing approaches relax the
   non-convexity using semi-definite relaxation SDR) or linearize the
   non-convex part and solve the resulting convex problem. However, these
   techniques are seldom successful in even obtaining a feasible solution
   when the QCQP matrices are indefinite. In this letter, a new feasible
   point pursuit successive convex approximation FPP-SCA) algorithm is
   proposed for non-convex QCQPs. FPP-SCA linearizes the non-convex parts

Title = {{Virulence genes are a signature of the microbiome in the colorectal
   tumor microenvironment}},
Journal = {{GENOME MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{Background: The human gut microbiome is associated with the development
   of colon cancer, and recent studies have found changes in the microbiome
   in cancer patients compared to healthy controls. Studying the microbial
   communities in the tumor microenvironment may shed light on the role of
   host-bacteria interactions in colorectal cancer. Here, we highlight the
   major shifts in the colorectal tumor microbiome relative to that of
   matched normal colon tissue from the same individual, allowing us to
   survey the microbial communities in the tumor microenvironment and
   providing intrinsic control for environmental and host genetic effects
   on the microbiome.
   Methods: We sequenced the microbiome in 44 primary tumor and 44
   patient-matched normal colon tissue samples to determine differentially
   abundant microbial taxa These data were also used to functionally
   characterize the microbiome of the cancer and normal sample pairs and
   identify functional pathways enriched in the tumor-associated
   microbiota.
   Results: We find that tumors harbor distinct microbial communities
   compared to nearby healthy tissue. Our results show increased microbial
   diversity in the tumor microenvironment, with changes in the abundances
   of commensal and pathogenic bacterial taxa, including Fusobacterium and
   Providencia. While Fusobacterium has previously been implicated in
   colorectal cancer, Providencia is a novel tumor-associated agent which
   has not been identified in previous studies. Additionally, we identified
   a clear, significant enrichment of predicted virulence-associated genes
   in the colorectal cancer microenvironment, likely dependent upon the
   genomes of Fusobacterium and Providencia.
   Conclusions: This work identifies bacterial taxa significantly
   correlated with colorectal cancer, including a novel finding of an
   elevated abundance of Providencia in the tumor microenvironment. We also
   describe the predicted metabolic pathways and enzymes differentially
   present in the tumor-associated microbiome, and show an enrichment of
   virulence-associated bacterial genes in the tumor microenvironment. This
   predicted virulence enrichment supports the hypothesis that the
   microbiome plays an active role in colorectal cancer development and/or
   progression. Our results provide a starting point for future prognostic
   and therapeutic research with the potential to improve patient outcomes.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Brightness Analysis of Fluorescence Intensity Fluctuations
   in E. Coli}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 22}},
Abstract = {{The brightness measured by fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy
   specifies the average stoichiometry of a labeled protein in a sample.
   Here we extended brightness analysis, which has been mainly applied in
   eukaryotic cells, to prokaryotic cells with E. coli serving as a model
   system. The small size of the E. coli cell introduces unique challenges
   for applying brightness analysis that are addressed in this work.
   Photobleaching leads to a depletion of fluorophores and a reduction of
   the brightness of protein complexes. In addition, the E. coli cell and
   the point spread function of the instrument only partially overlap,
   which influences intensity fluctuations. To address these challenges we
   developed MSQ analysis, which is based on the mean Q-value of segmented
   photon count data, and combined it with the analysis of axial scans
   through the E. coli cell. The MSQ method recovers brightness,
   concentration, and diffusion time of soluble proteins in E. coli. We
   applied MSQ to measure the brightness of EGFP in E. coli and compared it
   to solution measurements. We further used MSQ analysis to determine the
   oligomeric state of nuclear transport factor 2 labeled with EGFP
   expressed in E. coli cells. The results obtained demonstrate the
   feasibility of quantifying the stoichiometry of proteins by brightness
   analysis in a prokaryotic cell.}},

Abstract = {{In frozen and lyophilized systems, the biological to be stabilized (e.g.
   therapeutic protein, biomarker, drug-delivery vesicle) and the
   cryo-/lyo-protectant should be co-localized for successful
   stabilization. During freezing and drying, many factors cause physical
   separation of the biological from the cryo-/lyoprotectant, called
   microheterogeneity (MH), which may result in poor stabilization
   efficiency. We have developed a novel technique that utilized confocal
   Raman microspectroscopy in combination with counter-gradient freezing to
   evaluate the effect of a wide range of freezing temperatures (-20 < T-F<
   0 degrees C) on the MH generated within a frozen formulation in only a
   few experiments. The freezing experiments conducted with a model system
   (albumin and trehalose) showed the presence of different degrees of MH
   in the freeze-concentrated liquid (FCL) in all solutions tested. Mainly,
   albumin tended to accumulate near the ice interface, where it was
   physically separated from the cryoprotectant. In frozen 10 wt\%
   trehalose solutions, heterogeneity in FCL was relatively low at any T-F.
   In frozen 20 wt\% trehalose solutions, the optimum albumin to trehalose
   ratio in the FCL can only be ensured if the solution was frozen within a
   narrow range of temperatures (-16 < T-F< -10 degrees C). In the 30 wt\%
   trehalose solutions, freezing within a much more narrow range (-12 <
   T-F< -10 degrees C) was needed to ensure a fairly homogeneous FCL. The
   method developed here will be helpful for the development of uniformly
   frozen and stable formulations and freezing protocols for biological as
   MH is presumed to directly impact stability. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Because of the noninvasive, locally selective potential of thermal
   energy, considerable effort has been focused on the use of an external,
   alternating magnetic field for conversion of magnetic work to heat with

   remains a challenge because of the lack of feedback from the local
   temperature change to the external power supply. Here, we show
   development of smart magnetic nanoparticles composed of Fe and Si with
   intrinsically tunable heat generation capability. They were engineered
   to possess an adjustable magnetic transition temperature through tuning
   the exchange between Fe atoms by incorporation of silicon atoms. They
   show relatively high magnetic moment. Moreover, their biocompatibility
   was established in several cell lines. The nanoparticles were also
   combined with a thermosensitive polymer, which had the capability to
   release of molecules with a magnetic stimulus, thereby providing a
   platform for locally controlled, drug release.}},

Title = {{The Role of Exciton Ionization Processes in Bulk Heterojunction Organic
   Photovoltaic Cells}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ENERGY MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{JUN 17}},
Abstract = {{To realize efficient photoconversion in organic semiconductors,
   photogenerated excitons must be dissociated into their constituent
   electronic charges. In an organic photovoltaic (OPV) cell, this is most
   often accomplished using an electron donor-acceptor (D-A) interface.
   Interestingly, recent work on MoOx/C-60 Schottky OPVs has demonstrated
   that excitons in C-60 may also undergo efficient bulk-ionization and
   generate photocurrent as a result of the large built-in field created by
   the MoOx/C-60 interface. Here, it is demonstrated that bulk ionization
   processes also contribute to the short-circuit current density (J(SC))
   and open-circuit voltage (V-OC) in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) OPVs with
   fullerene-rich compositions. Temperature-dependent measurements of
   device performance are used to distinguish dissociation by
   bulk-ionization from charge transfer at the D-A interface. In optimized
   fullerene-rich BHJs based on the D-A pairing of boron subphthalocyanine
   chloride (SubPc)-C-60, bulk-ionization is found to be responsible for
   approximate to 16\% of the total photocurrent, and >30\% of the
   photocurrent originating from C-60. The presence of bulk-ionization in
   C-60 also impacts the temperature dependence of V-OC, with
   fullerene-rich SubPc:C-60 BHJ OPVs showing a larger V-OC than evenly
   mixed BHJs. The prevalence of bulk-ionization processes in efficient,
   fullerene-rich BHJs underscores the need to include these effects when
   engineering device design and morphology in OPVs.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactide (PLA) was melt blended with either polypropylene (PP) or a
   polypropylene based elastomer (PBE, Vistamaxx) in an effort to improve
   its mechanical properties. An ethylene-glycidyl methacrylate-methyl
   acrylate terpolymer (PEGMMA, Lotader) was utilized as compatibilizer
   through coupling to the end groups of PLA. Graft copolymers formed
   enhanced the adhesion between PLA and polyolefin phases and lowered the
   interfacial tension. The morphological, mechanical, and rheological
   properties of the PLA/polyolefin compatibilized blends were
   investigated, and the blends exhibited substantial improvement in
   elongation at break and tensile toughness as compared to the
   corresponding binary blends. The remarkable efficacy of PEGMMA as a
   reactive compatibilizing agent allows the bridging of two immiscible but
   important classes of thermoplastics, polylactide and polypropylene, and
   the production of ductile PLA/PP blend materials.}},

Title = {{Magnetically nanostructured state in a Ni-Mn-Sn shape-memory alloy}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{21}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{For certain compositions Ni-Mn-Sn and related magnetic shape-memory
   alloys undergo a martensitic transition at temperatures in the range
   300-400 K, with the emergence of novel magnetic properties below the
   transition. While Ni50Mn50 is an antiferromagnet, substitution of Sn on
   some fraction of the Mn sites in Ni50Mn50-xSnx leads to competing
   ferromagnetic (F) and antiferromagnetic (AF) phases at low temperatures.
   Details of this magnetic phase coexistence are, however, significantly
   lacking, particularly with respect to the AF phase. The present
   investigations use zero applied magnetic field Mn-55 NMR as a local
   probe of the magnetic properties of the alloy Ni50Mn50-xSnx with x = 10.
   Rich multipeak spectra are observed, and the various components are
   definitively assigned to nanoscale F or AF regions. Measurements of the
   static nuclear hyperfine field distributions as a function of
   temperature, and in small applied fields, together with nuclear
   relaxation rates provide detailed information on the size distributions,
   relative concentrations, and physical natures of these F and AF regions.
   The results show that the nanoscale magnetic features of the x = 10
   system are substantially more complex than previous studies have
   suggested. We argue that the general approach used in these experiments
   is applicable to other such complex metal alloys, and could yield many
   additional insights.}},

Title = {{Sap flow of black ash in wetland forests of northern Minnesota, USA:
   Hydrologic implications of tree mortality due to emerald ash borer}},
Journal = {{AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{206}},
Pages = {{4-11}},
Month = {{JUN 15}},
Abstract = {{Black ash (Fraxinus nigra) mortality caused by the invasive emerald ash
   borer (EAB) is of concern to land managers in the upper Great Lakes
   region, given the large areas of ash-dominated forest and potential
   alteration of wetland hydrology following loss of this foundation tree
   species. The importance of changes in evapotranspiration (ET) following
   black ash mortality is currently unknown and is the focus of this study.
   Sap flux density rates were evaluated at three black ash stands with
   differing moisture regimes within the Chippewa National Forest,
   Minnesota, USA using the Granier thermal dissipation method. Sapwood
   area and sap flux density were combined to determine sap flow. Tree
   level sap flux density estimates were comparable to other reported
   values and averaged 4.59, 2.31, and 1.62 m(3) m(-2) day(-1),
   respectively, for the very wet, wet, and moderately wet field sites.
   However, black ash exhibited small sapwood area in general, resulting in
   lower overall sap flow values. Scaled stand-level transpiration followed
   a similar trend as the tree-level estimates; mean daily transpiration
   over 10 weeks was 1.62 (80\% of PET), 1.15 (53\% of PET), and 0.90 (42\%
   of PET) mm for the very wet, wet, and moderately wet site, respectively.
   Sap flux density was positively related to vapor pressure deficit when
   soil moisture was at or near saturation and negatively related when soil
   moisture content was lower. There was also a significant positive
   relationship between sap flux density and relative soil moisture
   saturation at the stand scale. Our results indicate that hydrologic
   regime has substantial influence on sap flow with highest transpiration
   when soil moisture is at saturation, underscoring the unique ecological
   role that black ash plays in these wetland forest types. The effects of
   EAB-induced black ash mortality on overall ET and related hydrologic
   processes will likely be greatest in the wettest hydrologic regimes. (C)

Abstract = {{Background: Malaria is a major health threat, affecting over 40\% of the
   world's population. The latest report released by the World Health
   Organization estimated about 207 million cases of malaria infection, and
   about 627,000 deaths in 2012 alone. During the past decade, new
   therapeutic targets have been identified and are at various stages of
   characterization, thanks to the emerging omics-based technologies.
   However, the mechanism of malaria pathogenesis remains largely unknown.
   In this paper, we employ a novel neighborhood subnetwork alignment
   approach to identify network components that are potentially involved in
   pathogenesis.
   Results: Our module-based subnetwork alignment approach identified 24
   functional homologs of pathogenesis-related proteins in the malaria
   parasite P. falciparum, using the protein-protein interaction networks
   in Escherichia coli as references. Eighteen out of these 24 proteins are
   associated with 418 other proteins that are related to DNA replication,
   transcriptional regulation, translation, signaling, metabolism, cell
   cycle regulation, as well as cytoadherence and entry to the host.
   Conclusions: The subnetwork alignments and subsequent protein-protein
   association network mining predicted a group of malarial proteins that
   may be involved in parasite development and parasite-host interaction,
   opening a new systems-level view of parasite pathogenesis and virulence.}},

Title = {{Optimized inorganic carbon regime for enhanced growth and lipid
   accumulation in Chlorella vulgaris}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUN 11}},
Abstract = {{Background: Large-scale algal biofuel production has been limited, among
   other factors, by the availability of inorganic carbon in the culture
   medium at concentrations higher than achievable with atmospheric CO2.
   Life cycle analyses have concluded that costs associated with supplying
   CO2 to algal cultures are significant contributors to the overall energy
   consumption.
   Results: A two-phase optimal growth and lipid accumulation scenario is
   presented, which (1) enhances the growth rate and (2) the
   triacylglyceride (TAG) accumulation rate in the oleaginous Chlorophyte
   Chlorella vulgaris strain UTEX 395, by growing the organism in the
   presence of low concentrations of NaHCO3 (5 mM) and controlling the pH
   of the system with a periodic gas sparge of 5 \% CO2 (v/v). Once
   cultures reached the desired cell densities, which can be
   ``fine-tuned{''} based on initial nutrient concentrations, cultures were
   switched to a lipid accumulation metabolism through the addition of 50
   mM NaHCO3. This two-phase approach increased the specific growth rate of
   C. vulgaris by 69 \% compared to cultures sparged continuously with 5 \%
   CO2 (v/v); further, biomass productivity (g L-1 day(-1)) was increased
   by 27 \%. Total biodiesel potential {[}assessed as total fatty acid
   methyl ester (FAME) produced] was increased from 53.3 to 61 \% (FAME
   biomass(-1)) under the optimized conditions; biodiesel productivity (g
   FAME L-1 day-1) was increased by 7.7 \%. A bicarbonate salt screen
   revealed that American Chemical Society (ACS) and industrial grade
   NaHCO3 induced the highest TAG accumulation (\% w/w), whereas Na2CO3 did
   not induce significant TAG accumulation. NH4HCO3 had a negative effect
   on cell health presumably due to ammonia toxicity. The raw, unrefined
   form of trona, NaHCO3 center dot Na2CO3 (sodium sesquicarbonate) induced
   TAG accumulation, albeit to a slightly lower extent than the more
   refined forms of sodium bicarbonate.
   Conclusions: The strategic addition of sodium bicarbonate was found to
   enhance growth and lipid accumulation rates in cultures of C. vulgaris,
   when compared to traditional culturing strategies, which rely on
   continuously sparging algal cultures with elevated concentrations of
   CO2(g). This work presents a two-phased, improved photoautotrophic
   growth and lipid accumulation approach, which may result in an overall
   increase in algal biofuel productivity.}},

Abstract = {{The transferable potential's for phase equilibria force field is
   extended to hydrogen sulfide. The pure-component and :binary
   vapor-liquid equilibria with methane and carbon dioxide and the
   liquid-phase relative permittivity are used for the parametrization of
   the Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Coulomb interactions, and models with three
   and four interaction sites are considered. For the three-site models,
   partial point charges are placed on the sites representing the three
   atoms, while the negative partial charge is moved to an off-atom site
   for the four-site models. The effect of molecular shape is probed using
   either only a single LJ interaction site on the sulfur atom or adding
   sites also on the hydrogen atoms. This procedure results in four
   distinct models, but only those with three LJ sites can accurately
   reproduce all properties considered for the parametrization. These two
   are further assessed for predictions of the liquid-phase structure, the
   lattice parameters and relative permittivity for the face-centered-cubic
   solid, and the triple point. An effective balance between LJ
   interactions and the dipolar and quadrupolar terms of the first-order
   electrostatic interactions is struck in order to obtain a four-site
   model that describes the condensed-phase properties and the phase
   equilibria with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time deformation events in epoxies with different cross-link
   density, modified with rubbery and glassy core block copolymer micelles,
   were captured by collecting small-angle X-ray scattering patterns while
   simultaneously straining the sample. Analysis and interpretation of the
   scattering patterns provide quantitative information about deformation
   processes leading to toughness in these materials. These experiments
   yielded direct evidence of cavitation in 30 nm rubber particles as
   anticipated by theory. We found that the extent of void growth after
   cavitation is strongly affected by the cross-link density of the matrix
   and is directly correlated to the toughness enhancement of the material.
   Our findings imply that the combination of micelle and matrix properties
   strongly affects the processes leading to toughness in block copolymer
   modified epoxies.}},

Abstract = {{The design of scaffolds which mimic the stiffness, nano-fiber
   structure,, and biochemistry of the native extracellular matrix (ECM)
   has been a major objective for the tissue engineering field.
   Furthermore,. mimicking the innate three-dimensional (3D) environment of
   the ECM has been shown to significantly altered cellular response
   compared to that of traditional two-dimensional (2D) culture. We report
   the development of a self-assembling, fibronectin-mimetic,
   peptide-amphiphile nanofiber scaffold for 3D cell culture. To form such
   a scaffold, 5 mol \% of a bioactive PR\_g fibronectin-mimetic
   peptideamphiphile was mixed with 95 mol \% of a diluent
   peptide-amphiphile (E2) whose purpose was to neutralize electrostatic
   interactions, increase the gelation kinetics, and promote, cell
   survival. Atomic force microscopy verified the fibrilar structure of the
   gels, and the mechanical properties were characterized for various
   weight percent (wt \%) formulations of the 5 Mol \% PR\_g-95 mol \% E2
   peptide-amphiphile mixture. The 0.5 wt \% formulations had an elastic
   modulus of 429.0 +/- 21.3 Pa whereas the 1.0 wt \% peptideamphiphile
   hydrogels had an elastic modulus of 808.6 +/- 38.1 Pa. The presence of
   entrapped cells in the gels decreased the,elastic modulus, and the
   decrease was a function of cell loading. Although both formulations
   supported cell proliferation, the 0.5 wt \% gels supported significantly
   greater NIH3T3/GFP fibroblast cell proliferation throughout the gels
   than the 1:0 wt \% gel's. However, compared to the 0.5 wt \%
   formulations, the 1.0 wt \% hydrogels promoted greater increases in mRNA
   expression and the production of fibronectin and type IV collagen ECM
   proteins. This study suggests that this fibronectin-mimetic scaffold
   holds great promise in the advancement of 3D culture applications and
   cell therapies.}},

Abstract = {{The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), a commonly used measure of fidelity in
   physical systems, is defined as the ratio of the squared amplitude or
   variance of a signal relative to the variance of the noise. This
   definition is not appropriate for neural systems in which spiking
   activity is more accurately represented as point processes. We show that
   the SNR estimates a ratio of expected prediction errors and extend the
   standard definition to one appropriate for single neurons by
   representing neural spiking activity using point process generalized
   linear models (PP-GLM). We estimate the prediction errors using the
   residual deviances from the PP-GLM fits. Because the deviance is an
   approximate chi(2) random variable, we compute a bias-corrected SNR
   estimate appropriate for single-neuron analysis and use the bootstrap to
   assess its uncertainty. In the analyses of four systems neuroscience
   experiments, we show that the SNRs are -10 dB to -3 dB for guinea pig
   auditory cortex neurons, -18 dB to -7 dB for rat thalamic neurons, -28
   dB to -14 dB for monkey hippocampal neurons, and -29 dB to -20 dB for
   human subthalamic neurons. The new SNR definition makes explicit in the
   measure commonly used for physical systems the often-quoted observation
   that single neurons have low SNRs. The neuron's spiking history is
   frequently a more informative covariate for predicting spiking
   propensity than the applied stimulus. Our new SNR definition extends to
   any GLM system in which the factors modulating the response can be
   expressed as separate components of a likelihood function.}},

Abstract = {{Equations of state (EoS) are a fundamental subject in high
   pressure/temperature (PT) research. Ab initio calculations based on
   density functional theory (DFT) can provide valuable information about a
   material's EoS at PT conditions that cannot be easily accessed
   experimentally. However, these calculations have systematic errors due
   to (1) a lack of a precise description of the exchange correlation
   energy, (2) methodological limitations in the way temperature is
   addressed, for instance, anharmonicity at high temperatures in
   quasiharmonic calculations. To address the first issue, we have
   improved, developed, and tested correction schemes aiming to remove DFT
   errors and to produce predictive low temperature EoS with accuracy
   comparable to experiments. We have investigated four schemes and applied
   them to three different functionals. The second issue has been addressed
   with a simple anharmonic correction that effectively removed high
   temperature anharmonic errors. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Considerable progress has been made in the treatment of hearing loss
   with auditory implants. However, there are still many implanted patients
   that experience hearing deficiencies, such as limited speech
   understanding or vanishing perception with continuous stimulation (i.e.,
   abnormal loudness adaptation). The present study aims to identify
   specific patterns of cerebral cortex activity involved with such
   deficiencies. We performed O-15-water positron emission tomography (PET)
   in patients implanted with electrodes within the cochlea, brainstem, or
   midbrain to investigate the pattern of cortical activation in response
   to speech or continuous multi-tone stimuli directly inputted into the
   implant processor that then delivered electrical patterns through those
   electrodes. Statistical parametric mapping was performed on a single
   subject basis. Better speech understanding was correlated with a larger
   extent of bilateral auditory cortex activation. In contrast to speech,
   the continuous multi-tone stimulus elicited mainly unilateral auditory
   cortical activity in which greater loudness adaptation corresponded to
   weaker activation and even deactivation. Interestingly, greater loudness
   adaptation was correlated with stronger activity within the ventral
   prefrontal cortex, which could be up-regulated to suppress the
   irrelevant or aberrant signals into the auditory cortex. The ability to
   detect these specific cortical patterns and differences across patients
   and stimuli demonstrates the potential for using PET to diagnose
   auditory function or dysfunction in implant patients, which in turn
   could guide the development of appropriate stimulation strategies for
   improving hearing rehabilitation. Beyond hearing restoration, our study
   also reveals a potential role of the frontal cortex in suppressing
   irrelevant or aberrant activity within the auditory cortex, and thus may
   be relevant for understanding and treating tinnitus.}},

Abstract = {{The large thermal resistance across the carbon nanotube (CNT)-polymer
   matrix interface is a limiting factor for achieving polymer composites
   with high thermal conductivities. Using equilibrium molecular dynamics
   simulations we show that an azide-terminated aromatic polymer HLK5
   (C22H25O3N3) functionalized onto the CNT sidewall can efficiently
   decrease the thermal resistance between the nanotube and different types
   of polymer matrices (polystyrene, epoxy, and polyethylene). The HLK5
   functionalization can also significantly decrease the CNT-CNT junction
   resistance. Compared with hydroxyl and octane functionalizations, the
   HLK5 one alters less the high intrinsic CNT thermal conductivity at the
   same surface coverage ratio. By revealing the important role played by
   the atomistic van der Waals interactions in attaining these key results,
   our study brings a new perspective in the nanoscale design of advanced
   CNT-polymer materials}},

Abstract = {{A three-step method to create dense polycrystalline semiconductor thin
   films from nanocrystal liquid dispersions is described. First, suitable
   substrates are coated with nanocrystals using aerosol-jet printing.
   Second, the porous nanocrystal coatings are compacted using a weighted
   roller or a hydraulic press to increase the coating density. Finally,
   the resulting coating is annealed for grain growth. The approach is
   demonstrated for making polycrystalline films of copper zinc tin sulfide
   (CZTS), a new solar absorber composed of earth-abundant elements. The
   range of coating morphologies accessible through aerosol-jet printing is
   examined and their formation mechanisms are revealed. Crack-free albeit
   porous films are obtained if most of the solvent in the aerosolized
   dispersion droplets containing the nanocrystals evaporates before they
   impinge on the substrate. In this case, nanocrystals agglomerate in
   flight and arrive at the substrate as solid spherical agglomerates.
   These porous coatings are mechanically compacted, and the density of the
   coating increases with compaction pressure. Dense coatings annealed in
   sulfur produce large-grain (>1 mu m) polycrystalline CZTS films with
   microstructure suitable for thin-film solar cells.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a fluorescence-based assay that allows for direct
   measurement of protein binding to the plasma membrane inside living
   cells. An axial scan through the cell generates a fluorescence intensity
   profile that is analyzed to determine the membrane-bound and cytoplasmic
   concentrations of a peripheral membrane protein labeled by the enhanced
   green fluorescent protein (EGFP). The membrane binding curve is
   constructed by mapping those concentrations for a population of cells
   with a wide range of protein expression levels, and a fit of the binding
   curve determines the number of binding sites and the dissociation
   coefficient. We experimentally verified the technique, using
   myosin-1C-EGFP as a model system and fit its binding curve. Furthermore,
   we studied the protein-lipid interactions of the membrane binding
   domains from lactadherin and phospholipase C-delta 1 to evaluate the
   feasibility of using competition binding experiments to identify
   specific lipid-protein interactions in living cells. Finally, we applied
   the technique to determine the lipid specificity, the number of binding
   sites, and the dissociation coefficient of membrane binding for the Gag
   matrix domain of human T-lymphotropic virus type 1, which provides
   insight into early assembly steps of the retrovirus.}},

Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The chronic nature of vascular disease progression requires the
   development of experimental techniques that simulate physiologic and
   pathologic vascular behaviors on disease-relevant time scales.
   Previously, microcontact printing has been used to fabricate
   two-dimensional functional arterial mimics through patterning of
   extracellular matrix protein as guidance cues for tissue organization.
   Vascular muscular thin films utilized these mimics to assess functional
   contractility. However, the microcontact printing fabrication technique
   used typically incorporates hydrophobic PDMS substrates. As the tissue
   turns over the underlying extracellular matrix, new proteins must
   undergo a conformational change or denaturing in order to expose
   hydrophobic amino acid residues to the hydrophobic PDMS surfaces for
   attachment, resulting in altered matrix protein bioactivity,
   delamination, and death of the tissues.
   Here, we present a microfluidic deposition technique for patterning of
   the crosslinker compound genipin. Genipin serves as an intermediary
   between patterned tissues and PDMS substrates, allowing cells to deposit
   newly-synthesized extracellular matrix protein onto a more hydrophilic
   surface and remain attached to the PDMS substrates. We also show that
   extracellular matrix proteins can be patterned directly onto deposited
   genipin, allowing dictation of engineered tissue structure. Tissues
   fabricated with this technique show high fidelity in both structural
   alignment and contractile function of vascular smooth muscle tissue in a
   vascular muscular thin film model. This technique can be extended using
   other cell types and provides the framework for future study of chronic
   tissue-and organ-level functionality.}},

Abstract = {{Compiler scalability is a well known problem: reasoning about the
   application of useful optimizations over large program scopes consumes
   too much time and memory during compilation. This problem is exacerbated
   in polyhedral compilers that use powerful yet costly integer programming
   algorithms to compose loop optimizations. As a result, the benefits that
   a polyhedral compiler has to offer to programs such as real scientific
   applications that contain sequences of loop nests, remain impractical
   for the common users.
   In this work, we address this scalability problem in polyhedral
   compilers. We identify three causes of unscalability, each of which
   stems from large number of statements and dependences in the program
   scope. We propose a one-shot solution to the problem by reducing the
   effective number of statements and dependences as seen by the compiler.
   We achieve this by representing a sequence of statements in a program by
   a single super-statement. This set of super-statements exposes the
   minimum sufficient constraints to the Integer Linear Programming (ILP)
   solver for finding correct optimizations. We implement our approach in
   the PLuTo polyhedral compiler and find that it condenses the program
   statements and program dependences by factors of 4.7x and 6.4x,
   respectively, averaged over 9 hot regions (ranging from 48 to 121
   statements) in 5 real applications. As a result, the improvements in
   time and memory requirement for compilation are 268x and 20x,
   respectively, over the latest version of the PLuTo compiler. The final
   compile times are comparable to the Intel compiler while the performance
   is 1.92x better on average due to the latter's conservative approach to
   loop optimization.}},

Abstract = {{A total of 8 assays was conducted to study the influence of different
   variables namely, light intensity, CO2 level, NaNO3 concentration and
   aeration rate, on the cultivation of the marine microalgae Chlorella sp.
   to enhance the biomass feedstock availability for biodiesel. The
   experiments were designed using a Taguchi L8 experimental array set at
   two levels of operation, having light intensity (0.85 and 14.5 klux),
   CO2 (5 and 10\%), NaNO3 (0.025 and 0.075 g L-1) and aeration rate (3: 33
   and 1.67 vvm) as independent variables and considering biomass
   productivity and lipid content as response variables. All the
   experiments were performed in six photobioreactor vessels connected in
   series with a total volume of 8.4 L and working volumes of 2 L and 4 L,
   depending on the conditions assessed. The highest biomass productivity
   was 210.9 mg L-1 day(-1), corresponding to a lipid content of 8.2\%.
   Such results were attained when the culture conditions were set at 0.85
   klux light intensity, 5\% CO2 and 0.075 g L-1 NaNO3. The aeration rate
   showed no significant influence on the biomass productivity. On the
   other hand, the highest lipid content was achieved when the cultures
   were grown using the lowest concentration of NaNO3 (0.025 g L-1) and an
   aeration rate of 1.67 vvm, while the other factors had no statistical
   significance. Under these conditions, the lipid content obtained was
   19.8\%, at the expense of reducing the biomass productivity to 85.9 mg
   L-1 day(-1). The fatty acid profile of the lipid material characterized
   by gas chromatography identified fourteen fatty acids with carbon chain
   ranging from C8 to C20 in which most of the fatty acids present were
   saturated (58.7 \%) and monounsaturated (36.1\%) fatty acids. Those
   obtained at higher proportions were the oleic (22.8\%), palmitic
   (20.7\%) and lauric (17.7 \%) acids, indicating a suitable composition
   for fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) synthesis. This was confirmed by acid
   catalysis performed under ultrasound irradiations reaching a conversion
   rate of 78.4\% within only 4 h. (C) 2015 BRTeam. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{River deltas are intricate landscapes with complex channel networks that
   self-organize to deliver water, sediment, and nutrients from the apex to
   the delta top and eventually to the coastal zone. The natural balance of
   material and energy fluxes, which maintains a stable hydrologic,
   geomorphologic, and ecological state of a river delta, is often
   disrupted by external perturbations causing topological and dynamical
   changes in the delta structure and function. A formal quantitative
   framework for studying delta channel network connectivity and transport
   dynamics and their response to change is lacking. Here we present such a
   framework based on spectral graph theory and demonstrate its value in
   computing delta's steady state fluxes and identifying upstream
   (contributing) and downstream (nourishment) areas and fluxes from any
   point in the network. We use this framework to construct vulnerability
   maps that quantify the relative change of sediment and water delivery to
   the shoreline outlets in response to possible perturbations in hundreds
   of upstream links. The framework is applied to the Wax Lake delta in the
   Louisiana coast of the U.S. and the Niger delta in West Africa. In a
   companion paper, we present a comprehensive suite of metrics that
   quantify topologic and dynamic complexity of delta channel networks and,
   via application to seven deltas in diverse environments, demonstrate
   their potential to reveal delta morphodynamics and relate to notions of
   vulnerability and robustness.}},

Abstract = {{Deltas are landforms that deliver water, sediment and nutrient fluxes
   from upstream rivers to the deltaic surface and eventually to oceans or
   inland water bodies via multiple pathways. Despite their importance,
   quantitative frameworks for their analysis lack behind those available
   for tributary networks. In a companion paper, delta channel networks
   were conceptualized as directed graphs and spectral graph theory was
   used to design a quantitative framework for exploring delta connectivity
   and flux dynamics. Here we use this framework to introduce a suite of
   graph-theoretic and entropy-based metrics, to quantify two components of
   a delta's complexity: (1) Topologic, imposed by the network connectivity
   and (2) Dynamic, dictated by the flux partitioning and distribution. The
   metrics are aimed to facilitate comparing, contrasting, and establishing
   connections between deltaic structure, process, and form. We illustrate
   the proposed analysis using seven deltas in diverse morphodynamic
   environments and of various degrees of channel complexity. By projecting
   deltas into a topo-dynamic space whose coordinates are given by
   topologic and dynamic delta complexity metrics, we show that this space
   provides a basis for delta comparison and physical insight into their
   dynamic behavior. The examined metrics are demonstrated to relate to the
   intuitive notion of vulnerability, measured by the impact of upstream
   flux changes to the shoreline flux, and reveal that complexity and
   vulnerability are inversely related. Finally, a spatially explicit
   metric, akin to a delta width function, is introduced to classify shapes
   of different delta types.}},

   macroscale (average topographic features) and microscale (landform
   reorganization) is of interest both for deciphering past climates from
   today's landscapes and for predicting future landscapes in view of
   recent climatic trends. Although several studies have addressed
   macro-scale response, only a few have focused on quantifying
   smaller-scale basin reorganization. To that goal, a series of controlled
   laboratory experiments were conducted where a self-organized complete
   drainage network emerged under constant precipitation and uplift
   dynamics. Once steady state was achieved, the landscape was subjected to
   a fivefold increase in precipitation (transient state). Throughout the
   evolution, high-resolution spatiotemporal topographic data in the form
   of digital elevation models were collected. The steady state landscape
   was shown to possess three distinct geomorphic regimes (unchannelized
   hillslopes, debris-dominated channels, and fluvially dominated
   channels). During transient state, landscape reorganization was observed
   to be driven by hillslopes via accelerated erosion, ridge lowering,
   channel widening, and reduction of basin relief as opposed to channel
   base-level reduction. Quantitative metrics on which these conclusions
   were based included slope-area curve, correlation analysis of spatial
   and temporal elevation increments, and wavelet spectral analysis of the
   evolving landscapes. Our results highlight that landscape reorganization
   in response to increased precipitation seems to follow an arrow of
   scale: major elevation change initiates at the hillslope scale driving
   erosional regime change at intermediate scales and further cascading to
   geomorphic changes at the channel scale as time evolves.}},

Abstract = {{BaSnO3 has recently been identified as a high mobility wide gap

   conditions resulting in single-phase, relaxed, close to stoichiometric
   films. Most significantly, vacuum annealing is established as a facile
   route to n-doped BaSnO3-delta, leading to electron densities above
   10(19) cm(-3), 5 m Omega cm resistivities, and room temperature mobility
   of 20 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in 300-angstrom-thick films on MgO(001). Mobility
   limiting factors, and the substantial scope for their improvement, are

   interaction and the optical behavior of the nanoclusters from regimes
   characterized by photoluminescence quenching to photoluminescence
   enhancement. The combination of detailed X-ray scattering probing with
   photoluminescence intensity and lifetime studies revealed the relation
   between the cluster structure and its optical output. Compared to
   conventional light-harvesting systems like conjugated polymers and
   multichromophoric dendrimers, the proposed nanoclusters bring enhanced
   flexibility in controlling the optical behavior toward a desired

Title = {{Identification of the biologically active liquid chemistry induced by a

Journal = {{BIOINTERPHASES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of interaction of cold nonequilibrium plasma jets with
   mammalian cells in physiologic liquid is reported. The major biological
   active species produced by an argon RF plasma jet responsible for cell
   viability reduction are analyzed by experimental results obtained
   through physical, biological, and chemical diagnostics. This is
   complemented with chemical kinetics modeling of the plasma source to
   assess the dominant reactive gas phase species. Different plasma
   chemistries are obtained by changing the feed gas composition of the
   cold argon based RF plasma jet from argon, humidified argon (0.27\%), to
   argon/oxygen (1\%) and argon/air (1\%) at constant power. A minimal
   consensus physiologic liquid was used, providing isotonic and isohydric
   conditions and nutrients but is devoid of scavengers or serum
   constituents. While argon and humidified argon plasma led to the
   creation of hydrogen peroxide dominated action on the mammalian cells,
   argon-oxygen and argon-air plasma created a very different biological
   action and was characterized by trace amounts of hydrogen peroxide only.
   In particular, for the argon-oxygen (1\%), the authors observed a strong
   negative effect on mammalian cell proliferation and metabolism. This
   effect was distance dependent and showed a half life time of 30 min in a
   scavenger free physiologic buffer. Neither catalase and mannitol nor
   superoxide dismutase could rescue the cell proliferation rate. The
   strong distance dependency of the effect as well as the low water
   solubility rules out a major role for ozone and singlet oxygen but
   suggests a dominant role of atomic oxygen. Experimental results suggest
   that O reacts with chloride, yielding Cl-2(-) or ClO-. These chlorine
   species have a limited lifetime under physiologic conditions and
   therefore show a strong time dependent biological activity. The outcomes
   are compared with an argon MHz plasma jet (kinpen) to assess the
   differences between these (at least seemingly) similar plasma sources.

Title = {{mRNA 3 `-UTR shortening is a molecular signature of mTORC1 activation}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) enhances translation from a subset
   of messenger RNAs containing distinct 5'-untranslated region (UTR)
   sequence features. Here we identify 3'-UTR shortening of mRNAs as an
   additional molecular signature of mTOR activation and show that 3'-UTR
   shortening enhances the translation of specific mRNAs. Using genetic or
   chemical modulations of mTOR activity in cells or mouse tissues, we show
   that cellular mTOR activity is crucial for 3'-UTR shortening. Although
   long 3'-UTR-containing transcripts minimally contribute to translation,
   3-'UTR-shortened transcripts efficiently form polysomes in the
   mTOR-activated cells, leading to increased protein production.
   Strikingly, selected E2 and E3 components of ubiquitin ligase complexes
   are enriched by this mechanism, resulting in elevated levels of protein
   ubiquitination on mTOR activation. Together, these findings identify a
   previously uncharacterized role for mTOR in the selective regulation of
   protein synthesis by modulating 3'-UTR length of mRNAs.}},

Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{260-266}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Brittleness is one of the important material properties that influences
   the success or failure of powder compaction. We have discovered that the
   reciprocal of diametrical elastic strain at fracture is the most
   suitable tablet brittleness indices (TBIs) for quantifying brittleness
   of pharmaceutical tablets. The new strain based TBI is supported by both
   theoretical considerations and a systematic statistical analysis of
   friability data. It is sufficiently sensitive to changes in both tablet
   compositions and compaction parameters. For all tested materials, it
   correctly shows that tablet brittleness increases with increasing tablet
   porosity for the same powder. In addition, TBI increases with increasing
   content of a brittle excipient, lactose monohydrate, in the mixtures
   with a plastic excipient, microcrystalline cellulose. A probability map
   for achieving less than 1\% tablet friability at various combinations of
   tablet tensile strength and TBI was constructed. Data from marketed
   tablets validate this probability map and a TBI value of 150 is
   recommended as the upper limit for pharmaceutical tablets. This TBI can
   be calculated from the data routinely obtained during tablet diametrical
   breaking test, which is commonly performed for assessing tablet
   mechanical strength. Therefore, it is ready for adoption for quantifying
   tablet brittleness to guide tablet formulation development since it does
   not require additional experimental work. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Low-duty-cycle operation has been adopted to alleviate the consumption
   rate of energy, which is significant for the power scarcity sensor
   networks. The sleep latency brought by low-duty-cycle mode, however,
   leads to a dramatic increase of delay, which may not be tolerable for
   delay-sensitive applications. In this work, we introduce the
   transmission power control mechanism into low-duty-cycle sensor
   networks. Particularly, we propose Delay-bounded Transmission Power
   Control (DTPC), a cross-layer approach, to minimize the energy
   consumption of sensor nodes while meeting the user-specified delay
   constraint. In DTPC, each node builds its own transmission table using
   dynamical programming and then adaptively selects the approximate
   forwarding entry according to the delay bound. In addition, our design
   is embedded to support both single-parent and multi-parent data
   forwarding scheme. The extensive simulations and test-bed experiment
   results show that DTPC can guarantee the delay bound with much lower
   energy cost compared with other well-known schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Clinicians often use the term ``hibernating myocardium{''} in reference
   to patients with ischemic heart disease and decreased function within
   viable myocardial regions. Because the term is a descriptor of nature's
   process of torpor, we provide a comparison of the adaptations observed
   in both conditions. In nature, hearts from hibernating animals undergo a
   shift in substrate preference in favor of fatty acids, while preserving
   glucose uptake and glycogen. Expression of electron transport chain
   proteins in mitochondria is decreased while antioxidant proteins
   including uncoupling protein-2 are increased. Similarly, hibernating
   hearts from patients have a comparable metabolic signature, with
   increased glucose uptake and glycogen accumulation and decreased oxygen
   consumption. In contrast to nature however, patients with hibernating
   hearts are at increased risk for arrhythmias, and contractility does not
   fully recover following revascularization. Clearly, additional
   interventions need to be advanced in patients with coronary artery
   disease and hibernating myocardium to prevent refractory heart failure.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, organizations are working to reduce the environmental
   footprint of their supply chains. The use of environmentally preferable
   purchasing criteria is one strategy organizations use to address this
   goal. However, evaluating the environmental performance of these
   criteria (e.g., recycled content, biodegradable, renewable, and so on)
   has remained elusive. Life cycle assessment (LCA) can measure the impact
   reduction potential of sourcing strategies. However, full process-based
   LCAs are time-consuming and costly across multiple criteria of thousands
   of products and inputs purchased in an organizational setting. A
   streamlined hotspot methodology is presented using a combination of
   environmentally extended economic input-output (EEIO) approaches and
   extant literature to identify hotspots in which to constrain a
   parameterized process-based LCA. A case study of breakfast cereal
   manufacturing is developed to (1) assess the efficiencies associated
   with the hotspotting approach and (2) demonstrate its applicability in
   generating comparable decision signals of environmentally preferable
   sourcing criteria for procurement and supply-chain managers along the

Abstract = {{Tissues such as skeletal muscle and kidneys have well-defined structure
   that affects the measurements of mechanical properties. As an approach
   to characterize the material properties of these tissues, different
   groups have assumed that they are transversely isotropic (TI) and
   measure the shear wave velocity as it varies with angle with respect to
   the structural architecture of the organ. To refine measurements in
   these organs, it is desirable to have tissue-mimicking phantoms that
   exhibit similar anisotropic characteristics. Some approaches involve
   embedding fibers into a material matrix. However, if a homogeneous solid
   is under compression due to a static stress, an acoustoelastic effect
   can manifest that makes the measured wave velocities change with the
   compression stress. We propose to exploit this characteristic to
   demonstrate that stressed tissue mimicking phantoms can be characterized
   as a TI material. We tested six phantoms made with different
   concentrations of gelatin and agar. Stress was applied by the weight of
   a water container centered on top of a plate on top of the phantom. A
   linear array transducer and a V-1 Verasonics system were used to induce
   and measure shear waves in the phantoms. The shear wave motion was
   measured using a compound plane wave imaging technique. Autocorrelation
   was applied to the received in-phase/quadrature data. The shear wave
   velocity, c, was estimated using a Radon transform method. The
   transducer was mounted on a rotating stage so measurements were made
   every 10 degrees over a range of 0 degrees to 360 degrees, where the
   stress is applied along 0 degrees to 180 degrees direction. The shear
   moduli were estimated. A TI model was fit to the data and the fractional
   anisotropy was evaluated. This approach can be used to explore many
   configurations of transverse isotropy with the same phantom, simply by
   applying stress to the tissue-mimicking phantom.}},

Abstract = {{Paracrine signalling from chondrocytes has been reported to increase the
   synthesis and expression of cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) by stem
   cells. The use of conditioned medium obtained from chondrocytes for
   stimulating stem cells chondrogenic differentiation may be a very
   interesting alternative for moving into the clinical application of
   these cells, as chondrocytes could be partially replaced by stem cells
   for this type of application. In the present study we aimed to achieve
   chondrogenic differentiation of two different sources of stem cells
   using conditioned medium, without adding growth factors. We tested both
   human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hBSMCs) and human
   Wharton's jelly-derived stem cells (hWJSCs). Conditioned medium obtained
   from a culture of human articular chondrocytes was used to feed the
   cells during the experiment. Cultures were performed in previously
   produced three-dimensional (3D) scaffolds, composed of a blend of 50:50
   chitosan:poly(butylene succinate). Both types of stem cells were able to
   undergo chondrogenic differentiation without the addition of growth
   factors. Cultures using hWJSCs showed significantly higher GAGs
   accumulation and expression of cartilage-related genes (aggrecan, Sox9
   and collagen type II) when compared to hBMSCs cultures. Conditioned
   medium obtained from articular chondrocytes induced the chondrogenic
   differentiation of MSCs and ECM formation. Obtained results showed that
   this new strategy is very interesting and should be further explored for
   clinical applications. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed knowledge of homoepitaxial growth modes in organic
   semiconductor thin films is critically important for understanding the
   interlayer electrostatic coupling and the surface energetics of
   device-active organic films, yet it is still largely missing due to the
   lack of effective characterization tools. This paper presents a
   convenient approach to characterize explicitly the homoepitaxial growth
   modes of pentacene bilayers thermally deposited on different dielectrics
   by combining two scanning probe microscopy (SPM) imaging modes, i.e.,
   friction force microscopy (FFM) and transverse shear microscopy (TSM).
   It is found that pentacene second layer grains consistently exhibit a
   mosaic of homoepitaxial modes (commensurism, coincidence, and
   non-epitaxy) regardless of the substrate type and deposition condition.
   Among different homoepitaxial modes, a coincident twist epitaxy is more
   frequently observed. This combined FFM/TSM technique offers a feasible
   way to identify complex microstructural motifs such that a deeper
   understanding of growth and structure-property relationships in organic
   semiconductor thin films is possible. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \&

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have been explored in the field of
   neuroengineering to investigate how the brain can use these systems to
   control external devices. We review the principles and approaches we
   have taken to develop a sensorimotor rhythm electroencephalography
   (EEG)-based brain-computer interface (BCI). The methods include
   developing BCI systems incorporating the control of physical devices to
   increase user engagement, improving BCI systems by inversely mapping
   scalp-recorded EEG signals to the cortical source domain, integrating
   BCI with noninvasive neuromodulation strategies to improve learning, and
   incorporating mind-body awareness training to enhance BCI learning and
   performance. The challenges and merits of these strategies are
   discussed, together with recent findings. Our work indicates that the
   sensorimotor-rhythm-based noninvasive BCI has the potential to provide
   communication and control capabilities as an alternative to
   physiological motor pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Evidence suggests that transplanted mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can
   aid recovery of damaged myocardium caused by myocardial infarction. One
   possible mechanism for MSC-mediated recovery is reprogramming after cell
   fusion between transplanted MSCs and recipient cardiac cells. We used a
   Cre/LoxP-based luciferase reporter system coupled to biophotonic imaging
   to detect fusion of transplanted human pluripotent stem cell-derived
   MSCs to cells of organs of living mice. Human MSCs, with transient
   expression of a viral fusogen, were delivered to the murine heart via a
   collagen patch. At 2 days and 1 week later, living mice were probed for
   bioluminescence indicative of cell fusion. Cell fusion was detected at
   the site of delivery (heart) and in distal tissues (i.e., stomach, small
   intestine, liver). Fusion was confirmed at the cellular scale via
   fluorescence in situ hybridization for human-specific and mouse-specific
   centromeres. Human cells in organs distal to the heart were typically
   located near the vasculature, suggesting MSCs and perhaps MSC fusion
   products have the ability to migrate via the circulatory system to
   distal organs and engraft with local cells. The present study reveals
   previously unknown migratory patterns of delivered human MSCs and
   associated fusion products in the healthy murine heart. The study also
   sets the stage for follow-on studies to determine the functional effects
   of cell fusion in a model of myocardial damage or disease.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the physical processes that occur when high-power
   continuous-wave laser light interacts with absorbing particles on a
   low-absorption optical surface. When a particulate-contaminated surface
   is illuminated by high-power continuous-wave laser light, a short burst
   of light is emitted from the surface, and the particles rapidly heat
   over a period of milliseconds to thousands of degrees Celsius, migrating
   over and evaporating from the surface. The surviving particles tend to
   coalesce into larger ones and leave a relatively flat residue on the
   surface. The total volume of the material on the surface has decreased
   dramatically. The optical surface itself heats substantially during
   illumination, but the surface temperature can decrease as the material
   is evaporated. Optical surfaces that survive this process without
   catastrophic damage are found to be more resistant to laser damage than
   surfaces that have not undergone the process. The surface temperature of
   the conditioned surfaces under illumination is lower than that of
   unconditioned surfaces. These conditioning effects on particles occurred
   within the first 30 s of laser exposure, with subsequent laser shots not
   affecting particle distributions. High-speed photography showed the
   actual removal and agglomeration of individual particles to occur within
   about 0.7 ms. Elemental changes were measured using time-of-flight
   secondary ion mass spectroscopy, with conditioned residuals being higher
   in hydrocarbon content than pristine particles. The tests in this study
   were conducted on high-reflectivity distributed Bragg reflector coated
   optics with carbon microparticles in the size range of 20-50 mu m, gold
   particles of size 250 nm, and silica 1 mu m in size. (C) 2015 Optical

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The steady inspiratory flow through an anatomically accurate model of
   the human airways was studied experimentally at a regime relevant to
   deep inspiration for aerosol drug delivery. Magnetic resonance
   velocimetry was used to obtain the three-component, mean velocity field.
   A strong, single-sided streamwise swirl was found in the trachea and
   persists up to the first bifurcation. There, the swirl and the
   asymmetric anatomy impact both the streamwise momentum distribution and
   the secondary flows in the main bronchi, with large differences compared
   to what is found in idealized branching tubes. In further generations,
   the streamwise velocity never recovers a symmetric profile and the
   relative intensity of the secondary flows remains strong. Overall, the
   results suggest that, in real human airways, both streamwise dispersion
   (due to streamwise gradients) and lateral dispersion (due to secondary
   flows) are very effective transport mechanisms. Neglecting the
   extrathoracic airways and idealizing the bronchial tree may lead to
   qualitatively different conclusions.}},

Abstract = {{Atomically thin two-dimensional semiconductors such as MoS2 hold great
   promise for electrical, optical and mechanical devices and display novel
   physical phenomena. However, the electron mobility of mono-and few-layer
   MoS2 has so far been substantially below theoretically predicted limits,
   which has hampered efforts to observe its intrinsic quantum transport
   behaviours. Potential sources of disorder and scattering include defects
   such as sulphur vacancies in the MoS2 itself as well as extrinsic
   sources such as charged impurities and remote optical phonons from oxide
   dielectrics. To reduce extrinsic scattering, we have developed here a
   van der Waals heterostructure device platform where MoS2 layers are
   fully encapsulated within hexagonal boron nitride and electrically
   contacted in a multi-terminal geometry using gate-tunable graphene
   electrodes. Magneto-transport measurements show dramatic improvements in
   performance, including a record-high Hall mobility reaching 34,000 cm(2)
   V-1 s(-1) for six-layer MoS2 at low temperature, confirming that
   low-temperature performance in previous studies was limited by extrinsic
   interfacial impurities rather than bulk defects in the MoS2. We also
   observed Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in high-mobility monolayer and
   few-layer MoS2. Modelling of potential scattering sources and quantum
   lifetime analysis indicate that a combination of short-range and
   long-range interfacial scattering limits the low-temperature mobility of
   MoS2.}},

Abstract = {{The human APOBEC3G (A3G) DNA cytosine deaminase restricts and
   hypermutates DNA-based parasites including HIV-1. The viral infectivity
   factor (Vif) prevents restriction by triggering A3G degradation.
   Although the structure of the A3G catalytic domain is known, the
   structure of the N-terminal Vif-binding domain has proven more elusive.
   Here, we used evolution-and structure-guided mutagenesis to solubilize
   the Vif-binding domain of A3G, thus permitting structural determination
   by NMR spectroscopy. A smaller zinc-coordinating pocket and altered
   helical packing distinguish the structure from previous catalytic-domain
   structures and help to explain the reported inactivity of this domain.
   This soluble A3G N-terminal domain is bound by Vif; this enabled
   mutagenesis and biochemical experiments, which identified a unique
   Vif-interacting surface formed by the alpha 1-beta 1, beta 2-alpha 2 and
   beta 4-alpha 4 loops. This structure sheds new light on the Vif-A3G
   interaction and provides critical information for future drug
   development.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note considers the stability of a feedback connection of
   a known linear, time-invariant system and a perturbation. The
   input/output behavior of the perturbation is described by an integral
   quadratic constraint (IQC). IQC stability theorems can be formulated in
   the frequency domain or with a time-domain dissipation inequality. The
   two approaches are connected by a non-unique factorization of the
   frequency domain IQC multiplier. The factorization must satisfy two
   properties for the dissipation inequality to be valid. First, the
   factorization must ensure the time-domain IQC holds for all finite
   times. Second, the factorization must ensure that a related matrix
   inequality, when feasible, has a positive semidefinite solution. This
   technical note shows that a class of frequency domain IQC multipliers
   has a factorization satisfying these two properties. Thus the
   dissipation inequality test, with an appropriate factorization, can be
   used with no additional conservatism.}},

Abstract = {{Acid site densities could be reversibly tuned by a factor of similar to
   30 using an O-2 co-feed, which reversibly creates Bronsted acid sites on

   K, a probe reaction, occurred on Bronsted acid sites of these
   oxygen-modified carbides with an intrinsic activation energy of 93 +/-
   1.3 kJ mole(-1) via an E-2 elimination mechanism with a
   kinetically-relevant step of beta-hydrogen scission. Site densities were
   estimated via in situ 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DTBP) titration and
   used to calculate a turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.1 s(-1), which was
   independent of site density. Oxygen co-processing allows for facile in
   situ tunability of acidic and metallic sites on highly oxophilic metal

Abstract = {{Osteosarcomas are sarcomas of the bone, derived from osteoblasts or
   their precursors, with a high propensity to metastasize. Osteosarcoma is
   associated with massive genomic instability, making it problematic to
   identify driver genes using human tumors or prototypical mouse models,
   many of which involve loss of Trp53 function. To identify the genes
   driving osteosarcoma development and metastasis, we performed a Sleeping
   Beauty (SB) transposon-based forward genetic screen in mice with and
   without somatic loss of Trp53. Common insertion site (CIS) analysis of
   119 primary tumors and 134 metastatic nodules identified 232 sites
   associated with osteosarcoma development and 43 sites associated with
   metastasis, respectively. Analysis of CIS-associated genes identified
   numerous known and new osteosarcoma-associated genes enriched in the
   ErbB, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and MAPK signaling pathways. Lastly, we identified
   several oncogenes involved in axon guidance, including Sema4d and
   Sema6d, which we functionally validated as oncogenes in human
   osteosarcoma.}},

Abstract = {{The stability and performance of nonlinear and linear parameter varying
   (LPV) time delayed systems are analyzed. First, the input/output
   behavior of the time delay operator is bounded in the frequency domain
   by integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). A simple geometric
   interpretation is used to derive new IQCs for both constant and varying
   delays. Second, the performance of nonlinear and LPV delayed systems is
   bounded using dissipation inequalities that incorporate IQCs. The
   nonlinear or LPV part of the system is treated directly in the analysis
   and not bounded by IQCs. This step makes use of recent results that
   show, under mild technical conditions, that an IQC has an equivalent
   representation as a Finite-horizon time-domain constraint. A numerical
   example with a nonlinear delayed system is provided to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the method. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In response to the need for learning tools tuned to big data analytics,
   the present paper introduces a framework for efficient clustering of
   huge sets of (possibly high-dimensional) data. Building on random
   sampling and consensus (RANSAC) ideas pursued earlier in a different
   (computer vision) context for robust regression, a suite of novel
   dimensionality-and set-reduction algorithms is developed. The advocated
   sketch-and-validate (SkeVa) family includes two algorithms that rely on
   -means clustering per iteration on reduced number of dimensions and/or
   feature vectors: The first operates in a batch fashion, while the second
   sequential one offers computational efficiency and suitability with
   streaming modes of operation. For clustering even nonlinearly separable
   vectors, the SkeVa family offers also a member based on user-selected
   kernel functions. Further trading off performance for reduced
   complexity, a fourth member of the SkeVa family is based on a divergence
   criterion for selecting proper minimal subsets of feature variables and
   vectors, thus bypassing the need for -means clustering per iteration.
   Extensive numerical tests on synthetic and real data sets highlight the
   potential of the proposed algorithms, and demonstrate their competitive
   performance relative to state-of-the-art random projection alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{In a heterogeneous network (HetNet) with a large number of low power
   base stations (BSs), proper user-BS association and power control is
   crucial to achieving desirable system performance. In this paper, we
   systematically study the joint BS association and power allocation
   problem for a downlink cellular network under the max-min fairness
   criterion. First, we show that this problem is NP-hard. Second, we show
   that the upper bound of the optimal value can be easily computed, and
   propose a two-stage algorithm to find a high-quality suboptimal
   solution. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is
   near-optimal in the high-SNR regime. Third, we show that the problem
   under some additional mild assumptions can be solved to global optima in
   polynomial time by a semi-distributed algorithm. This result is based on
   a transformation of the original problem to an assignment problem with
   gains log(g(ij)), where \{g(ij)\} are the channel gains.}},

Abstract = {{Whole cells encapsulated in silica gels are used in a wide variety of
   applications in biomedicine, biotechnology and bioremediation. Drying
   after encapsulation is desirable to enhance the strength of the gel and
   to make it lighter, facilitating its use, storage and transportation.
   However, preserving biological activity of the cells in a desiccated
   state remains a formidable challenge. In this study, different drying
   conditions for a silica gel-encapsulated bacterial biocatalyst (atrazine
   biodegrading Escherichia coli) were studied to enhance mechanical
   properties while sustaining long-term biocatalytic activity of the
   bacteria. Effects of lyoprotectant solutions containing 0.4 M sucrose,
   0.4 M trehalose or 30 \% (wt/wt) glycerol on the activity of the
   encapsulated bacteria during drying were investigated. It was determined
   that two orders of magnitude increase in the elastic modulus (E) and the
   compressive stress at failure (sigma) of the gel could be achieved by
   drying, independent of the drying rate. It was shown that partially
   desiccated silica gels preserved and enhanced the biocatalytic activity
   of the encapsulated bacteria up to a critical drying level. Atrazine
   biodegradation activity of encapsulated bacteria suspended with 0.4 M
   sucrose and PBS increased with increasing water removal, reaching a
   maximum at 68 \% water loss. This enhanced activity was sustained for 3
   months, when the gels were stored at 4 A degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Research was conducted to investigate the seismic performance of steel
   plate shear walls (SPSWs) having infill plates designed to resist
   different percentages of the applied lateral loads. The FEMA P695
   methodology, which defines the performance in terms of collapse
   potential under maximum considered earthquake (MCE) ground motions, was
   used to compare the performance of the SPSWs under consideration. This
   paper describes the development of component strength deterioration
   models that are needed to perform the collapse assessment of SPSWs,
   focusing on stress-strain or force-deformation relationships for infill
   plates and boundary elements. The approach began with identifying the
   deterioration and failures modes of SPSW from 36 tested specimens.
   Cyclic deformation capacities of these SPSWs when reaching their
   ultimate strength, failure points, and rates of degradation were
   statistically quantified. Based on these statistical results, initial
   deterioration models for SPSW components were developed in a format
   compatible for use with the FEMA P695 procedures. The chosen
   deteriorated material models for infill plates and boundary elements
   were calibrated to four selected SPSW specimens varying from one to four
   stories. A companion paper presents the steps and results of the seismic
   performance assessments. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of collapse potential and seismic performance was conducted
   for steel plate shear walls (SPSWs) having infill plates designed per
   two different philosophies. This assessment was first conducted on SPSWs
   that were designed neglecting the contribution of their boundary moment
   resisting frames to resist story shear forces. This assessment of
   collapse potential was repeated for SPSWs that were designed considering
   the sharing of story shear forces between the boundary frames and infill
   plates. Based on these assessments, seismic performance factors
   {[}i.e.,response modification coefficient (R-factor), system
   overstrength 0 factor, and deflection amplification Cd factor] for both
   types of SPSWs were identified and compared. Adjustments to improve
   collapse performance and factors that affect collapse potential were
   presented. Collapse fragility curves for archetypes with various
   structural configurations (i.e.,panel aspect ratio, intensity level of
   seismic weight, and number of stories) were investigated. Findings from
   these analyses demonstrate that the infill plates of SPSWs should be
   designed to resist the total specified story shears, and that SPSWs
   designed by sharing these story shears between the boundary frame and
   infill plates will undergo significantly larger and possibly
   unacceptable drifts. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose two algorithms for solving convex optimization
   problems with linear ascending constraints. When the objective function
   is separable, we propose a dual method which terminates in a finite
   number of iterations. In particular, the worst case complexity of our
   dual method improves over the best-known result for this problem in
   Padakandla and Sundaresan (SIAM J Optim 20(3):1185-1204, 2009). We then
   propose a gradient projection method to solve a more general class of
   problems in which the objective function is not necessarily separable.
   Numerical experiments show that both our algorithms work well in test
   problems.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) cell culture platforms are increasingly utilized
   due to their ability to more closely mimic the in vivo microenvironment
   compared to traditional two-dimensional methods. Limitations of
   currently available 3D materials include lack of cell attachment, long
   polymerization times, and inclusion of undefined xenobiotics, and
   cytotoxic cross-linkers. Evaluated here is a unique hydrogel comprised
   of polyelectrolytic complex (PEC) fibers formed by hyaluronic acid and
   chitosan (CT). When hydrated with fetal bovine serum containing human
   mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (hMSCs), a hydrogel with an elastic
   modulus of 264 +/- 38 Pa formed in seconds with cells distributed
   throughout the matrix. Scanning electron microscopy showed a
   lattice-like meshwork of PEC fibers forming irregular compartments.
   hMSCs showed 48\% viability during the first 24 h, with cell populations
   thereafter reaching a steady state for 14 days. hMSCs in the matrix were
   induced to differentiate to chondrogenic, osteogenic, and adipogenic
   phenotypes. Emergent features, at days 56 and 70, consisted of
   chondrogenesis on the surface of hydrogels induced to osteogenic and
   adipogenic phenotypes. Results indicate that this matrix may be useful

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that stream restoration at the reach scale may
   not increase stream biodiversity, raising concerns about the utility of
   this conservation practice. We examined whether reach-scale restoration
   in disturbed agricultural streams was associated with changes in
   macroinvertebrate community structure (total macroinvertebrate taxon
   richness, total macroinvertebrate density, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera,
   Trichoptera {[}EPT] taxon richness, \% abundance of EPT taxa) or
   secondary production (macroinvertebrate biomass over time). We collected
   macroinvertebrate samples over the course of 1 y from restored and
   unrestored reaches of 3 streams in southern Minnesota and used
   generalized least-square (GLS) models to assess whether measures of
   community structure were related to reach type, stream site, or sampling
   month. After accounting for effects of stream site and time, we found no
   significant difference in total taxon richness or \% abundance of EPT
   taxa between restored and unrestored reaches. However, the number of EPT
   taxa and macroinvertebrate density were significantly higher in restored
   than in unrestored reaches. We compared secondary production estimates
   among study reaches based on 95th-percentile confidence intervals
   generated via bootstrapping. In each study stream, secondary production
   was significantly (2-3x) higher in the restored than in the unrestored
   reach. Higher productivity in the restored reaches was largely a result
   of the disproportionate success of a few dominant, tolerant taxa. Our
   findings suggest that reach-scale restoration may have ecological
   effects that are not detected by measures of total taxon richness alone.}},

   grid resolutions are tested in the simulations. Significant improvements
   in void fraction and bubble size comparison are seen when the diameter
   to grid size ratio of the largest bubbles in the shear layer surpasses
   eight. A three-dimensional simulation is carried out for one Froude
   number jump, showing an improvement in the prediction of entrained air
   and bubble size compared with two-dimensional results at a substantial
   increase in computation time. An analysis of three-dimensional vorticity
   shows a complex interaction between spanwise and streamwise vortical
   structures and entrained air bubbles. The jump is similar to a turbulent
   mixing layer, constrained by the free surface, with vortex pairing and
   subsequent fluctuations in free surface elevation. Downstream
   fluctuations of the toe are associated with a roll up of the primary
   spanwise vortex, fluctuations of the free surface, and counter-rotating
   streamwise vortex pairs. The action of these flow structures is likely
   responsible for the improvement in three-dimensional results. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The design procedure for a 3 kWth prototype solar thermochemical reactor
   to implement isothermal redox cycling of ceria for CO2 splitting is
   presented. The reactor uses beds of mm-sized porous ceria particles
   contained in the annulus of concentric alumina tube assemblies that line
   the cylindrical wall of a solar cavity receiver. The porous particle
   beds provide high surface area for the heterogeneous reactions, rapid
   heat and mass transfer, and low pressure drop. Redox cycling is
   accomplished by alternating flows of inert sweep gas and CO2 through the
   bed. The gas flow rates and cycle step durations are selected by scaling
   the results from small-scale experiments. Thermal and thermo-mechanical
   models of the reactor and reactive element tubes are developed to
   predict the steady-state temperature and stress distributions for
   nominal operating conditions. The simulation results indicate that the
   target temperature of 1773K will be reached in the prototype reactor and
   that the Mohr-Coulomb static factor of safety is above two everywhere in
   the tubes, indicating that thermo-mechanical stresses in the tubes
   remain acceptably low.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive study of the drag forces acting on flat-sided columns is
   presented. The study considers a range of plane-sided column sections,
   from a sharp-cornered square section to varying degrees of corner
   chamfering and a full octagonal section. All chamfering was found to
   reduce the drag compared with the sharp-cornered case. It was also found
   there is a slight decrease in the drag coefficient as the Reynolds
   number of the fluid increases. For all cases except the octagonal
   section, drag increases significantly with increasing angle of attack.
   For the octagonal section, the drag coefficient increases then decreases
   as the angle of attack changes. The results agree with corresponding
   cases in the literature. The results are presented in a sequence of
   tables that allow users to estimate drag coefficients for any of the
   cases presented in the paper. As such, the study can serve as an
   archival repository for drag coefficient information. Comparisons of
   flow patterns are made, particularly in the wake region. It was found
   that the wake region becomes smaller as the chamfer becomes larger. The
   findings are important for the prediction of dynamic loads on exposed
   flat-sided columns above and below water, such as bridge pylons and
   offshore platform legs.}},

Abstract = {{Minimal food-processing methods are not effective against foodborne
   viruses, such as human norovirus (NV). It is important, therefore, to
   explore novel nonthermal technologies for decontamination of foods eaten
   fresh, minimally processed and ready-to-eat foods, and food contact
   surfaces. We studied the in vitro virucidal activity of cold atmospheric
   gaseous plasma (CGP) against feline calicivirus (FCV), a surrogate of
   NV. Factors affecting the virucidal activity of CGP (a so-called radio
   frequency atmospheric pressure plasma jet) were the plasma generation
   power, the exposure time and distance, the plasma feed gas mixture, and
   the virus suspension medium. Exposure to 2.5-W argon (Ar) plasma caused
   a 5.55 log(10) unit reduction in the FCV titer within 120 s. The
   reduction in the virus titer increased with increasing exposure time and
   decreasing exposure distance. Of the four plasma gas mixtures studied
   (Ar, Ar plus 1\% O-2, Ar plus 1\% dry air, and Ar plus 0.27\% water), Ar
   plus 1\% O-2 plasma treatment had the highest virucidal effect: more
   than 6.0 log(10) units of the virus after 15 s of exposure. The lowest
   virus reduction was observed with Ar plus 0.27\% water plasma treatment
   (5 log(10) unit reduction after 120 s). The highest reduction in titer
   was observed when the virus was suspended in distilled water. Changes in
   temperature and pH and formation of H2O2 were not responsible for the
   virucidal effect of plasma. The oxidation of viral capsid proteins by
   plasma-produced reactive oxygen and nitrogen species in the solution was
   thought to be responsible for the virucidal effect. In conclusion, CGP
   exhibits virucidal activity in vitro and has the potential to combat
   viral contamination in foods and on food preparation surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Antibiotic-resistant enterococcal infections are a major concern in
   hospitals where patients with compromised immunity are readily infected.
   Enterococcus faecium bacteria are of particular interest as these
   pathogens account for over 80\% of vancomycin-resistant enterococcal
   infections. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) produced at the site of
   infection by engineered bacteria may offer a potential alternative to
   traditional antibiotics for the treatment of resistant bacteria such as
   E. faecium. For this mode of delivery to be effective, it is essential
   to identify a suitable protein expression system that can be used in the
   desired delivery bacterium. In this study, we describe a promising
   chloride-inducible promoter and its application in the bacterial
   delivery of AMPs from Lactococcus lactis to reduce counts of E. faecium
   bacteria in vitro. Reporter gene studies show that at chloride
   concentrations found within the human intestines, the chloride-inducible
   promoter exhibits high levels of protein expression compared to those of
   the commonly used nisin-inducible promoter. These results indicate that
   this system is powerful and would not require the exogenous
   administration of an inducer molecule. In its application for AMP
   production against E. faecium in vitro, L. lactis producing AMPs under
   the chloride promoter rapidly decreased E. faecium counts by nearly
   10,000-fold. As an extension of this application, we also demonstrate
   the potential in using this type of delivery system in combination with
   traditional antibiotics to slow the development of resistance.
   Collectively, this study shows the promise of using a chloride-inducible
   promoter for the bacterial delivery of AMPs in the body for the
   treatment of vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and other
   antibiotic-resistant bacteria.}},

Abstract = {{It is now recognized that the tumor microenvironment creates a
   protective neo-tissue that isolates the tumor from the various defense
   strategies of the body. Evidence demonstrates that, with successive
   therapeutic attempts, cancer cells acquire resistance to individual
   treatment modalities. For example, exposure to cytotoxic drugs results
   in the survival of approximately 20-30\% of the cancer cells as only
   dividing cells succumb to each toxic exposure. With follow-up
   treatments, each additional dose results in tumor-associated fibroblasts
   secreting surface-protective proteins, which enhance cancer cell
   resistance. Similar outcomes are reported following radiotherapy. These
   defensive strategies are indicative of evolved capabilities of cancer to
   assure successful tumor growth through well-established
   anti-tumor-protective adaptations. As such, successful cancer management
   requires the activation of multiple cellular `kill switches' to prevent
   initiation of diverse protective adaptations. Thermal therapies are
   unique treatment modalities typically applied as monotherapies (without
   repetition) thereby denying cancer cells the opportunity to express
   defensive mutations. Further, the destructive mechanisms of action
   involved with cryoablation (CA) include both physical and molecular
   insults resulting in the disruption of multiple defensive strategies
   that are not cell cycle dependent and adds a damaging structural
   (physical) element. This review discusses the application and clinical
   outcomes of CA with an emphasis on the mechanisms of cell death induced
   by structural, metabolic, vascular and immune processes. The induction
   of diverse cell death cascades, resulting in the activation of apoptosis
   and necrosis, allows CA to be characterized as a combinatorial treatment
   modality. Our understanding of these mechanisms now supports adjunctive
   therapies that can augment cell death pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Given learning samples from a raster data set, spatial decision tree
   learning aims to find a decision tree classifier that minimizes
   classification errors as well as salt-and-pepper noise. The problem has
   important societal applications such as land cover classification for
   natural resource management. However, the problem is challenging due to
   the fact that learning samples show spatial autocorrelation in class
   labels, instead of being independently identically distributed. Related
   work relies on local tests (i.e., testing feature information of a
   location) and cannot adequately model the spatial autocorrelation
   effect, resulting in salt-and-pepper noise. In contrast, we recently
   proposed a focal-test-based spatial decision tree (FTSDT), in which the
   tree traversal direction of a sample is based on both local and focal
   (neighborhood) information. Preliminary results showed that FTSDT
   reduces classification errors and salt-and-pepper noise. This paper
   extends our recent work by introducing a new focal test approach with
   adaptive neighborhoods that avoids over-smoothing in wedge-shaped areas.
   We also conduct computational refinement on the FTSDT training algorithm
   by reusing focal values across candidate thresholds. Theoretical
   analysis shows that the refined training algorithm is correct and more
   scalable. Experiment results on real world data sets show that new FTSDT
   with adaptive neighborhoods improves classification accuracy, and that
   our computational refinement significantly reduces training time.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A novel process was developed for converting scum, a waste material from
   wastewater treatment facilities, to biodiesel. Scum is an oily waste
   that was skimmed from the surface of primary and secondary settling
   tanks in wastewater treatment plants. Currently scum is treated either
   by anaerobic digestion or landfilling which raised several environmental
   issues. The newly developed process used a six-step method to convert
   scum to biodiesel, a higher value product. A combination of acid washing
   and acid catalyzed esterification was developed to remove soap and
   impurities while converting free fatty acids to methyl esters. A
   glycerol washing was used to facilitate the separation of biodiesel and
   glycerin after base catalyzed transesterification. As a result, 70\% of
   dried and filtered scum was converted to biodiesel which is equivalent
   to about 134,000 gallon biodiesel per year for the Saint Paul waste
   water treatment plant in Minnesota. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{With the development of wireless communications, Vehicular Ad Hoc
   Network (VANET) has received considerable attention on information
   sharing and data delivery services. In order to collect and control
   traffic conditions, Intelligent Transportations Systems (ITS) has
   deployed a number of Road Side Units (RSUs) along the roads to collect
   deliver traffic information to the Traffic Control Center (TCC) for
   analyzing traffic data. Although some VANET architectures have been
   proposed based on the predictable routes and schedules of buses, none of
   them considered taking advantage of such traffic infrastructures which
   already been supplied by ITS and combine them with scheduled buses. In
   this paper, we propose a two-tier BUSVANET that is fully integrated with
   RSUs and TCC as traffic infrastructures. In this new architecture, the
   communications of vehicles, not only benefit from the existence of
   buses, but also consider the effects of using RSUs and TCC. RSUs are
   used to ensure service coverage while TCC is helpful for locating the
   destination vehicle quickly. We also investigate how much benefits can
   be obtained by taking advantage of this type of traffic infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{An improved Non-Dimensional Lattice Boltzmann Method (NDLBM) is
   developed and a uniform computational code is compiled to fit into both
   direct and porous medium model simulations. Comparison studies based on
   natural convection of 240 cylindrical tube bundle heat exchangers
   immersed in a thin rectangular solar storage tank show the computational
   efficiency and accuracy of both direct simulations and porous medium
   model simulations achieved by using NDLBM. The governing parameters in
   the macroscopic, microscopic, and mesoscopic length scales corresponding
   to the enclosure width, tube diameter, and mesh size are obtained.
   Transient isotherms, streamlines, Nusselt numbers, and CPU time of nine
   models have been simulated for various pitch, porosity, and
   distributions of tubes. Given the same grid number and simulation time,
   the CPU time of the porous medium model simulations by using NDLBM is
   about 1/60 of that of porous medium simulations by using finite
   difference based on projection method, and 1/20 of that of the direct
   simulations with the uniform code based on NDLBM. The porous medium
   simulations can only obtain Darcy velocity and volume averaged
   temperature, while the direct simulations can obtain both macroscopic
   and microscopic velocity and temperature. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was performed to evaluate convective
   condensation and evaporation of R22, R32 and R410A inside a smooth tube
   (inner diameter 11.43 mm), a herringbone tube (fin root diameter 11.43
   mm) and a newly developed enhanced surface EHT tube (inner diameter 11.5
   mm) at low mass fluxes. The inner surface of the EHT tube is enhanced by
   dimple/protrusion and secondary petal arrays. For condensation, the heat
   transfer coefficient of the herringbone tube is 2.0-3.0 times larger
   than a smooth tube and the EHT tube is 1.3-1.95 times that of the smooth
   tube. The heat transfer enhancement ratios of the herringbone tube and
   the EHT tube are larger than their respective inner surface area ratios.
   Mass flux has a non-monotonic relation with the condensation heat
   transfer coefficient in the herringbone microfin tubes; this was
   especially evident for R32 and R410A. For evaporation, the EHT tube
   provides the best evaporation heat transfer performance for all the
   three refrigerants; this is mainly due to the heat transfer enhancement
   produced from the larger number of nucleation sites, increased
   interfacial turbulence, boundary layer disruption, flow separation and
   secondary flow generation caused by the dimple and petal arrays. The
   evaporation heat transfer coefficient of the herringbone tube is only
   slightly higher than that of the smooth tube. Overall, the EHT tube
   provides increased heat transfer enhancement for both condensation and
   evaporation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   pure water when the foam is adjacent to the heated or cooled boundary,

   benefit. The enhancement of heat transfer is attributed primarily to

Title = {{Investigations into the turbulent bubbly wake of a ventilated hydrofoil:
   Moving toward improved turbine aeration techniques}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL THERMAL AND FLUID SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{186-195}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The use of aerating hydroturbines to mitigate the problem of low
   dissolved oxygen in the discharge of hydroelectric power plants has
   recently attracted a lot of attention. The design of a ventilated
   hydroturbine requires a precise understanding of the dependence of the
   operating conditions (viz, liquid velocity, air ventilation rate,
   hydrofoil configuration, etc.) on the bubble size distribution generated
   in the bubbly wake and the consequent rise in dissolved oxygen in the
   downstream water. In the current research, experiments are conducted in
   the wake of a ventilated NACA0015 hydrofoil by systematic variation of
   hydrodynamic conditions allowing for quantitative analysis of aeration
   statistics and capabilities for turbine blade hydrofoil designs. The
   data concerning bubble velocity distributions, bubble locations and size
   distribution, void fraction, etc. are reported for a chosen reference
   case. In addition, trends in the variation of bubbly wake are explored
   particularly in the light of wake physics. It is found out that an
   increase in Reynolds number (Re) led to greater breakup, while an
   increase in normalized air ventilation rate (C-Q) favored greater
   coalescence events in the wake. Further, the PDF((d) over tilde) of the
   normalized bubble size (d) over tilde = d/d(32), where d(32) represents
   Sauter mean size distribution, is found to have a universally similar
   shape independent of either Re, C-Q or hydrofoil angle of attack.
   Finally, a numerical formulation is proposed for the bubble sizes in the
   hydrofoil wake. This rich dataset will also contribute to the
   development of a numerical turbulence model, to investigate turbulence
   effects on bubble size distribution and predict the rate of air
   entrainment and the oxygen transfer occurring in the wake at different
   hydrodynamic conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{138-149}},

Abstract = {{Thermal transport processes are numerically analyzed for a porous ceria
   structure undergoing reduction in a novel redox reactor for solar
   thermochemical fuel production. The cylindrical reactor cavity is formed
   by an array of annular reactive elements comprising the porous ceria
   monolith integrated with gas inlet and outlet channels. Two
   configurations are considered, with the reactor cavity consisting of 10
   and 20 reactive elements, respectively. Temperature dependent boundary
   heat fluxes are obtained on the irradiated cavity wall by solving for
   the surface radiative exchange using the net radiation method coupled to
   the heat and mass transfer model of the reactive element. Predicted
   oxygen production rates are in the range 40-60 mu mol s(-1) for the
   geometries considered. After an initial rise, the average temperature of
   the reactive element levels off at 1660 and 1680 K for the two
   geometries, respectively. For the chosen reduction reaction rate model,
   oxygen release continues after the temperature has leveled off which
   indicates that the oxygen release reaction is limited by chemical
   kinetics and/or mass transfer rather than by the heating rate. For a
   fixed total mass of ceria, the peak oxygen release rate is doubled for
   the cavity with 20 reactive elements due to lower local oxygen partial
   pressure. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Quantifying the relative contributions of different sources of water to
   a stream hydrograph is important for understanding the hydrology and
   water quality dynamics of a given watershed. To compare the performance
   of two methods of hydrograph separation, a graphical program {[}baseflow
   index (BFI)] and an end-member mixing analysis that used high-resolution
   specific conductance measurements (SC-EMMA) were used to estimate daily
   and average long-term slowflow additions of water to four small,
   primarily agricultural streams with different dominant sources of water
   (natural groundwater, overland flow, subsurface drain outflow, and
   groundwater from irrigation). Because the result of hydrograph
   separation by SC-EMMA is strongly related to the choice of slowflow and
   fastflow end-member values, a sensitivity analysis was conducted based
   on the various approaches reported in the literature to inform the
   selection of end-members. There were substantial discrepancies among the
   BFI and SC-EMMA, and neither method produced reasonable results for all
   four streams. Streams that had a small difference in the SC of slowflow
   compared with fastflow or did not have a monotonic relationship between
   streamflow and stream SC posed a challenge to the SC-EMMA method. The
   utility of the graphical BFI program was limited in the stream that had
   only gradual changes in streamflow. The results of this comparison
   suggest that the two methods may be quantifying different sources of
   water. Even though both methods are easy to apply, they should be
   applied with consideration of the streamflow and/or SC characteristics
   of a stream, especially where anthropogenic water sources (irrigation
   and subsurface drainage) are present. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Evidence-based guidelines recommend early functional rehabilitation of

   their rehabilitation in a hospital inpatient setting. Standard inpatient
   measures of outcome were monitored where lack of progress from admission
   to discharge might indicate possible harm. Total FIM scores at admission
   (median 40, range 22-53) changed to (74, 50-96), Motor FIM scores from
   (23, 13-32) to (50, 32-68) and Berg Balance scores from (3, 0-6) to (19,
   7-43) at discharge. Changes reached Minimal Clinical Important
   Difference for a sufficient proportion (>0.6) of the patients to
   indicate no harm to the patients. In addition, therapists reported the
   technology was safe, provided a positive experience for the patient and
   fit within the rehabilitation program. They reported the device should
   be easier to set up and exit. We conclude acute stroke patients
   tolerated Balance-Bed exercises such as standing on one or two legs,
   squats, stepping in place as well as balance perturbations provided by
   the therapist. We believe this is the first time it has been
   demonstrated that acute stroke patients can safely perform whole body
   balance training including balance perturbations as part of their
   rehabilitation program. Future studies should include a control group
   and compare outcomes from best practices to interventions using the
   Balance Bed In addition, the technology is relevant for countermeasure
   development for spaceflight and as a test-bed of balance function under
   microgravity-like conditions.}},

   preferentially oriented thin films of MFI, which had sub-12-nm thickness
   in certain cases. Upon calcination, there was no contraction detectable

Abstract = {{Thermal cracking in asphalt pavements continues to be a significant
   pavement distress mechanism in cold climate regions. The formation of
   discontinuities due to thermal cracking causes extensive damage to the
   integrity of the pavement and forms pathways for intrusion of water into
   the base and subgrade layers. Current use of the performance-based
   binder specifications has not been shown to effectively lower the
   propensity for this distress. When this is combined with advent of newer
   asphalt mix manufacturing and construction technologies as well as
   desire for incorporation of greater amounts of recycled materials in
   paving mixtures, it has led to significant research and implementation
   efforts on asphalt mixture performance-based specifications. On the
   basis of various past research studies on low temperature cracking, a
   performance specification that utilises fracture energy of asphalt
   mixtures through use of disk-shaped compact tension (DCT) test has been
   developed. A significant number of present studies are underway to
   implement these specifications including two states which are in the
   pilot implementation stage. A major question that has been raised during
   the implementation of these specifications has been in the lack of
   information on sensitivity of pavement thermal cracking performance to
   the variations in fracture energy of the mixture. The present study
   focused on determining the effects on thermal cracking performance of
   pavements for variations in DCT fracture energy of asphalt mixtures. The
   sensitivity was determined through use of the IlliTC thermal cracking
   simulation system. The IlliTC system utilises asphalt mixture's fracture
   and viscoelastic properties to conduct finite element-based simulations
   using realistic pavement thermal loading conditions. Although this
   system has been validated in the past, the present study conducted
   further validation through comparison of predicted cracking performance
   with field-measured cracking performance. For sensitivity analysis,
   three types of asphalt mixtures for three climatic conditions and three
   pavement structures were evaluated. Apart from other things, the
   fracture mechanics in asphalt concrete at lower temperatures depend on
   the material's fracture energy as well as its tensile strength. In order
   to ensure that the effects of fracture energy variations were the focus,
   a critical tensile strength value was determined for each scenario (for
   each mix for each climate), which allowed researchers to conduct the
   simulations with varying fracture energies (six different levels). The
   results show that a variation of 25 J/m(2) in the fracture energy could
   lead to significantly different pavement thermal cracking performances.
   This is a significant finding that will aid in continued implementation
   of the fracture energy-based material specifications and provides
   guidance to transportation agencies in development of the final version
   of their material specifications.}},

Abstract = {{Affinity binding peptides were examined for surface fabrication of
   synthetic polymeric materials. Peptides possessing strong binding
   affinities toward polyurethane (PU) were discovered via biopanning of
   M13 phage peptide library. The apparent binding constant (K-app) was as
   high as 2.68x10(9)M(-1) with surface peptide density exceeded
   1.8g/cm(2). Structural analysis showed that the ideal peptide had a high
   content (75\%) of H-donor amino acid residues, and that intensified
   hydrogen bond interaction was the key driving force for the highly
   stable binding of peptides on PU. PU treated with such affinity peptides
   promises applications as low-fouling materials, as peptides increased
   its wettability and substantially reduced protein adsorption and cell
   adhesion. These results demonstrated a facile but highly efficient
   one-step strategy for surface property modification of polymeric

Title = {{Evenness indices once again: critical analysis of properties}},
Journal = {{SPRINGERPLUS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAY 16}},
Abstract = {{Various properties have been advocated for biological evenness indices,
   with some properties being clearly desirable while others appear
   questionable. With a focus on such properties, this paper makes a
   distinction between properties that are clearly necessary and those that
   appear to be unnecessary or even inappropriate. Based on Euclidean
   distances as a criterion, conditions are introduced in order for an
   index to provide valid, true, and realistic representations of the
   evenness characteristic (attribute) from species abundance
   distributions. Without such value-validity property, it is argued that a
   measure or index provides only limited information about the evenness
   and results in misleading interpretations and evenness comparisons and
   incorrect results and conclusions. Among the overabundant variety of
   evenness indices, each of which is typically derived by rescaling a
   diversity measure to the interval from 0 to 1 and thereby controlling or
   adjusting for the species richness, most are found to lack the
   value-validity property and some lack the property of strict
   Schur-concavity. The most popular entropy-based index reveals an
   especially poor performance with a substantial overstatement of the
   evenness characteristic or a large positive value bias. One evenness
   index emerges as the preferred one, satisfying all properties and
   conditions. This index is based directly on Euclidean distances between
   relevant species abundance distributions and has an intuitively
   meaningful interpretation in terms of relative distances between
   distributions. The value validity of the indices is assessed by using a
   recently introduced probability distribution and from the use of
   computer-generated distributions with randomly varying species richness
   and probability (proportion) components.}},

Abstract = {{Extracting latent low-dimensional structure from high-dimensional data
   is of paramount importance in timely inference tasks encountered with
   ``Big Data{''} analytics. However, increasingly noisy, heterogeneous,
   and incomplete datasets, as well as the need for real-time processing of
   streaming data, pose major challenges to this end. In this context, the
   present paper permeates benefits from rank minimization to scalable
   imputation of missing data, via tracking low-dimensional subspaces and
   unraveling latent (possibly multi-way) structure from incomplete
   streaming data. For low-rank matrix data, a subspace estimator is
   proposed based on an exponentially weighted least-squares criterion
   regularized with the nuclear norm. After recasting the nonseparable
   nuclear norm into a form amenable to online optimization, real-time
   algorithms with complementary strengths are developed, and their
   convergence is established under simplifying technical assumptions. In a
   stationary setting, the asymptotic estimates obtained offer the
   well-documented performance guarantees of the batch nuclear-norm
   regularized estimator. Under the same unifying framework, a novel online
   (adaptive) algorithm is developed to obtain multi-way decompositions of
   low-rank tensors with missing entries and perform imputation as a
   byproduct. Simulated tests with both synthetic as well as real Internet
   and cardiac magnetic resonance imagery (MRI) data confirm the efficacy
   of the proposed algorithms, and their superior performance relative to
   state-of-the-art alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous iron oxides (2-line ferrihydrite, alpha-Fe2O3, gamma-Fe2O3,
   and Fe3O4) are successfully synthesized by modifying the reaction
   temperatures and calcination atmospheres of the sol-gel-based inverse
   micelle method. Different characterization techniques, such as PXRD, N-2
   sorption, SEM, HRTEM, Raman spectroscopy, and XANES, are performed to
   determine the properties of the catalysts. Larger pore sizes can be
   obtained in mesoporous gamma-Fe2O3 and Fe3O4 compared with mesoporous
   2-line ferrihydrite and alpha-Fe2O3. The catalytic performance of
   mesoporous iron oxides are examined as Fenton catalysts in orange II
   degradation in the presence of oxidant H2O2 at neutral pH under visible
   light. Adsorption capacities of mesoporous iron oxides on orange II are
   greater than that of commercial Fe2O3. The greatest adsorption capacity
   is found to be 49.3 mg/g with mesoporous 2-line ferrihydrite. In
   addition, the degradation efficiency of orange II is found to be
   markedly improved by mesoporous iron oxides compared with the commercial
   catalyst. In the best case scenario, 2-line ferrihydrite shows the
   highest degradation rate constant (0.0258 min(-1)) among all the
   catalysts tested. The excellent performance of 2-line ferrihydrite is
   mainly attributed to the larger surface area but also related to surface
   hydroxyl groups, acidic products, and possible additional adsorption
   sites. The recyclability of mesoporous 2-line ferrihydrite catalyst can
   be achieved up to 3 times without performance decay. At last, a
   discussion regarding the possible mechanisms of degradation of orange II
   over mesoporous 2-line ferrihydrite is proposed, based on the previous
   literature work and the observed reaction intermediates monitored by
   ESI/MS in this study.}},

Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{The direct method for computing thermal conductivity in nonequilibrium
   molecular dynamics gives rise to an artificial Kapitza resistance at the
   interface between thermostatted and unthermostatted regions. This
   resistance, which depends on the system size and the thermostat
   parameters, creates discontinuous jumps in the temperature and heat flux
   across the interface and therefore affects the measured thermal
   conductivity. In this paper, we propose a phenomenological relation for
   the Kapitza resistance that can be used to extract a value for the bulk
   thermal conductivity, which is independent of the system size and
   thermostat details. The paper also provides insight into the Kapitza
   phenomenon resulting from numerical thermostatting. (c) 2015 AIP

Abstract = {{We present elements of a stability theory for small, stochastic,
   nonlinear chemical reaction networks. Steady state probability
   distributions are computed with zero-information (ZI) closure, a closure
   algorithm that solves chemical master equations of small arbitrary
   nonlinear reactions. Stochastic models can be linearized around the
   steady state with ZI-closure, and the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix
   can be readily computed. Eigenvalues govern the relaxation of
   fluctuation autocorrelation functions at steady state. Autocorrelation
   functions reveal the time scales of phenomena underlying the dynamics of
   nonlinear reaction networks. In accord with the fluctuation-dissipation
   theorem, these functions are found to be congruent to response functions
   to small perturbations. Significant differences are observed in the
   stability of nonlinear reacting systems between deterministic and
   stochastic modeling formalisms. (C) 2015 Author(s). All article content,

Abstract = {{Antibiotics are by far the most common medications prescribed for
   children. Recent epidemiological data suggests an association between
   early antibiotic use and disease phenotypes in adulthood. Antibiotic use
   during infancy induces imbalances in gut microbiota, called dysbiosis.
   The gut microbiome's responses to antibiotics and its potential link to
   disease development are especially complex to study in the changing
   infant gut. Here, we synthesize current knowledge linking antibiotics,
   dysbiosis, and disease and propose a framework for studying
   antibiotic-related dysbiosis in children. We recommend future studies
   into the microbiome-mediated effects of antibiotics focused on four
   types of dysbiosis: loss of keystone taxa, loss of diversity, shifts in
   metabolic capacity, and blooms of pathogens. Establishment of a large
   and diverse baseline cohort to define healthy infant microbiome
   development is essential to advancing diagnosis, interpretation, and
   eventual treatment of pediatric dysbiosis. This approach will also help
   provide evidence-based recommendations for antibiotic usage in infancy.}},

Abstract = {{In this Perspective, we provide an overview,of the field of ultrafast
   electron microscopy (UEM). We begin by briefly discussing the emergence
   of methods for probing ultrafast structural dynamics and the information
   that can be obtained. Distinctions are drawn between the two main types
   a probes for femtosecond (fs) dynamics fast electrons and X-ray photons
   and emphasis is placed on hour the nature of charged particles is
   exploited in ultrafast electron-based' experiments:. Following this, we
   describe the versatility enabled by the ease with which electron
   trajectories and velocities can be manipulated with transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM): hardware configurations, and we emphasize how
   this is translated to the ability to measure scattering intensities in
   real, reciprocal, and energy space from presurveyed and selected
   rianoscale volumes. Owing to decades of ongoing research and development
   into TEM instrumentation combined with advances in specimen holder
   technology, comprehensive experiments can be conducted on a wide range
   of materials in various phases via in situ methods. Next, we describe
   the basic operating concepts, of UEM, and we emphasize that its
   development has led to extension of several of the formidable
   capabilities of TEM into the fs domain, dins increasing the accessible
   temporal parameter spade by several orders of magnitude. We then divide
   UEM studies into those conducted in real (imaging), reciprocal
   (diffraction), and energy (spectroscopy) spate. We begin each of these
   sections by providing a brief description of the basic operating
   principles and the types of information that can be gathered followed by
   descriptions of how these approaches are applied in UM, the type of
   specimen parameter space that can be probed, and an example of the types
   of dynamics that can be resolved. We conclude with an Outlook section,
   wherein we share our perspective on some future directions of the field
   pertaining to continued instrument development and application of the
   technique to solving seemingly intractable materials problems in
   addition to discovery-based research. Our goal with this Perspective is
   to bring the capabilities of TIEM to the-attention of materials
   scientists, chemists, physicists, and engineers in hopes that
   new,avenues of research emerge and to make clear the large parameter
   space that is opened by extending TEM, and the ability to readily
   manipulate electron trajectories and energies, into the ultrafast
   domain.}},

Title = {{Design and Construction of an Inexpensive Homemade Plant Growth Chamber}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Plant growth chambers produce controlled environments, which are crucial
   in making reproducible observations in experimental plant biology
   research. Commercial plant growth chambers can provide precise controls
   of environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and light
   cycle, and the capability via complex programming to regulate these
   environmental parameters. But they are expensive. The high cost of
   maintaining a controlled growth environment is often a limiting factor
   when determining experiment size and feasibility. To overcome the
   limitation of commercial growth chambers, we designed and constructed an
   inexpensive plant growth chamber with consumer products for a material
   cost of \$2,300. For a comparable growth space, a commercial plant
   growth chamber could cost \$40,000 or more. Our plant growth chamber had
   outside dimensions of 1.5 m (W) x 1.8 m (D) x 2 m (H), providing a total
   growth area of 4.5 m(2) with 40-cm high clearance. The dimensions of the
   growth area and height can be flexibly changed. Fluorescent lights with
   large reflectors provided a relatively spatially uniform
   photosynthetically active radiation intensity of 140-250 mu
   moles/m(2)/sec. A portable air conditioner provided an ample cooling
   capacity, and a cooling water mister acted as a powerful humidifier.
   Temperature, relative humidity, and light cycle inside the chamber were
   controlled via a z-wave home automation system, which allowed the
   environmental parameters to be monitored and programmed through the
   internet. In our setting, the temperature was tightly controlled: 22.2
   degrees C +/- 0.8 degrees C. The one-hour average relative humidity was
   maintained at 75\%+/- 7\% with short spikes up to +/- 15\%. Using the
   interaction between Arabidopsis and one of its bacterial pathogens as a
   test experimental system, we demonstrate that experimental results
   produced in our chamber were highly comparable to those obtained in a
   commercial growth chamber. In summary, our design of an inexpensive
   plant growth chamber will tremendously increase research opportunities
   in experimental plant biology.}},

Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{Structural brain imaging provides a critical framework for performing
   stereotactic and intraoperative MRI-guided surgical procedures, with
   procedural efficacy often dependent upon visualization of the target
   with which to operate. Here, we describe tools for in vivo,
   subject-specific visualization and demarcation of regions within the
   brainstem. High-field 7T susceptibility-weighted imaging and
   diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain were collected using a
   customized head coil from eight rhesus macaques. Fiber tracts including
   the superior cerebellar peduncle, medial lemniscus, and lateral
   lemniscus were identified using high-resolution probabilistic diffusion
   tractography, which resulted in three-dimensional fiber tract
   reconstructions that were comparable to those extracted from sequential
   application of a two-dimensional nonlinear brain atlas warping
   algorithm. In the susceptibility-weighted imaging, white matter tracts
   within the brainstem were also identified as hypointense regions, and
   the degree of hypointensity was age-dependent. This combination of
   imaging modalities also enabled identifying the location and extent of
   several brainstem nuclei, including the periaqueductal gray,
   pedunculopontine nucleus, and inferior colliculus. These
   clinically-relevant high-field imaging approaches have potential to
   enable more accurate and comprehensive subject-specific visualization of
   the brainstem and to ultimately improve patient-specific neurosurgical
   targeting procedures, including deep brain stimulation lead
   implantation.}},

Title = {{The effect of output-input isolation on the scaling and energy
   consumption of all-spin logic devices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{All-spin logic (ASL) is a novel approach for digital logic applications
   wherein spin is used as the state variable instead of charge. One of the
   challenges in realizing a practical ASL system is the need to ensure
   non-reciprocity, meaning the information flows from input to output, not
   vice versa. One approach described previously, is to introduce an
   asymmetric ground contact, and while this approach was shown to be
   effective, it remains unclear as to the optimal approach for achieving
   non-reciprocity in ASL. In this study, we quantitatively analyze
   techniques to achieve non-reciprocity in ASL devices, and we
   specifically compare the effect of using asymmetric ground position and
   dipole-coupled output/input isolation. For this analysis, we simulate
   the switching dynamics of multiple-stage logic devices with FePt and
   FePd perpendicular magnetic anisotropy materials using a combination of
   a matrix-based spin circuit model coupled to the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
   equation. The dipole field is included in this model and can act as both
   a desirable means of coupling magnets and a source of noise. The dynamic
   energy consumption has been calculated for these schemes, as a function
   of input/output magnet separation, and the results show that using a
   scheme that electrically isolates logic stages produces superior
   non-reciprocity, thus allowing both improved scaling and reduced energy
   consumption. (c) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic exchange has been incorporated in a description of magnetic
   recording media near the Curie temperature, as would be found during

   cost function that minimized the difference between atomistic properties

   exchange description at 1.5 nm discretization yields very similar
   switching and magnetization behavior to that found at 1.2 nm (and below)
   discretization for the previous isotropic exchange. This suggests that
   the increased accuracy of anisotropic exchange may also reduce the

Abstract = {{We have investigated the feasibility of BPM for HAMR via Finite

   substantiated the feasibility of 5 Tb/in(2) with two filling factors
   25\% and 56\% even when the maximum on-track bit temperature is below
   the Curie temperature. The success of this underheated switching is
   attributed to sufficiently low anisotropy instead of reduction of Curie
   temperature. The temperature gradient in the cross-track direction is
   almost doubled if the optical head width is reduced by half, indicating
   the possibility of higher areal densities. Moreover, contrary to
   continuous media, we also found that the power absorption peaks at the
   bottom of the bit patterned FePt when the media is illuminated from
   above, which is probably due to stronger coupling there between FePt and

   recording}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{117}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 7}},
Abstract = {{The thermal distribution of granular media for heat assisted magnetic
   recording has been explored by the heat Fourier equation; particularly,
   the effect of the thermal conductivities in the grain boundary has been
   extensively investigated. When the thermal conductivity is sufficiently
   small, the grain boundary provides a natural constraint to heat
   dissipation: the effective in-plane thermal conductivity can be ten
   times smaller than that of FePt with the decrease limited only by the
   heat dissipation through the interlayer MgO. For low thermal
   conductivities in the grain boundary, the out of plane thermal gradient
   increases sharply owing to the inability of the heat to spread.
   Therefore, a compromise between power consumption and uniformity of the
   temperature distribution within grains should be taken into account when
   optimizing the media design. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the mechanisms of energy transfer from cdSe quantum dots

   (7),13 (12),18(17)-tetraferrocenyl-5,10,15,2,0-tetraazapor phyrin) are
   used as energy acceptors in this proposed antenna system along with size
   dependent QDs as donors. Our approach includes Forster : resonance
   energy transfer (FRET) calculations as well as photoluminescence (PL)
   intensity and lifetime quenching measurements. Our FRET calculations
   indicate that higher energy transfer efficiency can be achieved with
   smaller quantum dot size. However,PL intensity and lifetime measurements
   suggest that energy transfer efficiency in QD/tetraazaporphyrin
   complexes is regulated by a competing trapassisted ultrafast quenching
   mechanism, which is more dominant with Smaller QD size. Furthermore it
   is found that the trap assisted quenching quenching process is more
   active in Op/TAP(Fc)Mg than it complexes. As a result, high efficiency
   energy transfer can be achieved in the complexes combining large QDs and
   TAP(Fc)Mg where assisted mechanism is suppressed. Out study suggests
   that CdSe quantum dots can be proxnising energy transfer donors for
   NIR-absorbing i tetraazaporphyrinS to form antenna systems With enhanced

Abstract = {{Structural, magnetic, and transport studies have been performed on
   perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJ) with Mo as the buffer and

   consistently better performance was obtained compared to that of
   conventional pMTJs with Ta layers. Large tunneling magnetoresistance
   (TMR) and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) values were retained
   in a wide range of samples with Mo layers after annealing for 2 h at 400
   degrees C, in sharp contrast to the junctions with Ta layers, in which
   superparamagnetic behavior with nearly vanishing magnetoresistance was
   observed. As a result of the greatly improved thermal stability, TMR as
   high as 162\% was obtained in junctions containing Mo layers. These
   results highlight the importance of the heavy-metal layers adjacent to

Abstract = {{Robust statistical methods are employed to reduce the noise in Monte
   Carlo ray tracing. Through the use of resampling, the sample mean
   distribution is determined for each pixel. Because this distribution is
   uni-modal and normal for a large sample site, robust estimates converge
   to the true mean of the pixel values. Compared to existing methods, less
   additional storage is required at each pixel because the sample mean
   distribution can be distilled down to a compact site, and fewer
   computations are necessary because the robust estimation process is
   sampling independent and needs a small input size to compute pixel
   values. The robust statistical pixel estimators ore not only resistant
   to impulse noise, but they also remove general noise from fat-tailed
   distributions. A substantial speedup in rendering can therefore be
   achieved by reducing the number of samples required,for a desired image
   quality. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated for
   path tracing simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares parameters that characterize vegetation flexibility
   effects on flow resistance and drag. Drag forces have been measured in a
   flume for simple cylindrical obstructions of the same shape and size but
   with different flexibility under several flow conditions. This data set
   is used to fit drag parameters and to relate their value to flexibility
   through the Cauchy Number. A formulation is presented where the drag
   coefficient is evaluated as a function of a new calibration velocity
   parameter which is related to the elastic modulus of the obstruction.
   While the use of a Vogel exponent and reference velocity provides a
   similar response, the reference velocity when used is somewhat nebulous
   and appears to have a critical impact on the parameter and the drag
   force calculated. The proposed formulation for drag reduction is more
   consistently estimated for the range of flexibilities in this study.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel three-stage blood vessel segmentation
   algorithm using fundus photographs. In the first stage, the green plane
   of a fundus image is preprocessed to extract a binary image after
   high-pass filtering, and another binary image from the morphologically
   reconstructed enhanced image for the vessel regions. Next, the regions
   common to both the binary images are extracted as the major vessels. In
   the second stage, all remaining pixels in the two binary images are
   classified using a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) classifier using a set
   of eight features that are extracted based on pixel neighborhood and
   first and second-order gradient images. In the third postprocessing
   stage, the major portions of the blood vessels are combined with the
   classified vessel pixels. The proposed algorithm is less dependent on
   training data, requires less segmentation time and achieves consistent
   vessel segmentation accuracy on normal images as well as images with
   pathology when compared to existing supervised segmentation methods. The
   proposed algorithm achieves a vessel segmentation accuracy of 95.2\%,
   95.15\%, and 95.3\% in an average of 3.1, 6.7, and 11.7 s on three
   public datasets DRIVE, STARE, and CHASE\_DB1, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The desire for self-powered nanosystenns and wearable devices has driven
   wide investigation of the sustainable energy source. Harvesting energy
   from the ambient environment with nanogenerators becomes a viable
   solution with the development of low-power electronics. Different
   devices can face dramatically different working conditions, which may
   seriously restrict the application of those nanogenerators. In this
   review article we describe the most recent progress in the study of the
   environmental effect on the nanogenerator. While a variety of
   nanogenerators have been developed using piezoelectric, triboelectric,
   pyroelectric and thermoelectric effects, the most studied piezoelectric
   nanogenerator and triboelectric nanogenerator will be discussed in more
   detail. This review emphasizes the important effect of the temperature,
   humidity, and water. The other effects, such as UV radiation or
   adsorption of gas or solid material, are also presented for certain
   nanogenerators. In the end we share our views of the future research
   directions and the remaining challenges in this field. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A laboratory experiment examined the effects of energetic coherent
   motions on the structure of the wake and power fluctuations generated by
   a model axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine. The model turbine was placed in
   an open-channel flow and operated under subcritical conditions. The
   incoming flow was locally perturbed with vertically oriented cylinders
   of various diameters. An array of three acoustic Doppler velocimeters
   aligned in the cross-stream direction and a torque transducer were used
   to collect high-resolution and synchronous measurements of the
   three-velocity components of the incoming and wake flow as well as the
   turbine power. A strong scale-to-scale interaction between the
   large-scale and broadband turbulence shed by the cylinders and the
   turbine power revealed how the turbulence structure modulates the
   turbine behavior. In particular, the response of the turbine to the
   distinctive von Karman-type vortices shed from the cylinders highlighted
   this phenomenon. The mean and fluctuating characteristics of the turbine
   wake are shown to be very sensitive to the energetic motions present in
   the flow. Tip vortices were substantially dampened and the near-field
   mean wake recovery accelerated in the presence of energetic motions in
   the flow. Strong coherent motions are shown to be more effective than
   turbulence levels for triggering the break-up of the spiral structure of
   the tip-vortices. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The wireless rechargeable sensor network is a promising platform for
   long-term applications such as inventory management, supply chain
   monitoring, and so on. For these applications, sensor localization is
   one of the most fundamental challenges. Different from a traditional
   sensor node, a wireless rechargeable sensor has to be charged above a
   voltage level by the wireless charger in order to support its sensing,
   computation, and communication operations. In this work, we consider the
   scenario where a mobile charger stops at different positions to charge
   sensors and propose a novel localization design that utilizes the unique
   Time of Charge (TOC) sequences among wireless rechargeable sensors.
   Specifically, we introduce two efficient region dividing methods,
   Internode Division and Interarea Division, to exploit TOC differences
   from both temporal and spatial dimensions to localize individual sensor
   nodes. To further optimize the system performance, we introduce both an
   optimal charger stop planning algorithm for the single-sensor case and a
   suboptimal charger stop planning algorithm for the generic multisensor
   scenario with a provable performance bound. We have extensively
   evaluated our design by both testbed experiments and large-scale
   simulations. The experiment and simulation results show that by as less
   as five stops, our design can achieve sub-meter accuracy and the
   performance is robust under various system conditions.}},

Title = {{Quantification of thickness and wrinkling of exfoliated two-dimensional
   zeolite nanosheets}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Some two-dimensional (2D) exfoliated zeolites are single-or near
   single-unit cell thick silicates that can function as molecular sieves.
   Although they have already found uses as catalysts, adsorbents and
   membranes precise determination of their thickness and wrinkling is
   critical as these properties influence their functionality. Here we
   demonstrate a method to accurately determine the thickness and wrinkles
   of a 2D zeolite nanosheet by comprehensive 3D mapping of its reciprocal
   lattice. Since the intensity modulation of a diffraction spot on tilting
   is a fingerprint of the thickness, and changes in the spot shape are a
   measure of wrinkling, this mapping is achieved using a large-angle
   tilt-series of electron diffraction patterns. Application of the method
   to a 2D zeolite with MFI structure reveals that the exfoliated MFI
   nanosheet is 1.5 unit cells (3.0 nm) thick and wrinkled anisotropically
   with up to 0.8 nm average surface roughness.}},

Abstract = {{Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small-angle neutron
   scattering recently have revealed that the well-known thermoreversible
   gelation of methylcellulose (MC) in water is due to the formation of

   linear and nonlinear viscoelastic response of MC solutions and gels can
   be described by a filament-based mechanical model. In particular,
   large-amplitude oscillatory shear experiments show that aqueous MC
   materials transition from shear thinning to shear thickening behavior at
   the gelation temperature. The critical stress at which MC gels depart
   from the linear viscoelastic regime and begin to stiffen is well
   predicted from the filament model over a concentration range of 0.18-2.0
   wt \%. These predictions are based on fibril densities and persistence
   lengths obtained experimentally from neutron scattering, combined with
   cross-link spacings inferred from the gel modulus via the same model.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to design obfuscated circuits for
   digital signal processing (DSP) applications using high-level
   transformations, a key-based obfuscating finite-state machine (FSM), and
   a reconfigurator. The goal is to design DSP circuits that are harder to
   reverse engineer. High-level transformations of iterative data-flow
   graphs have been exploited for area-speed-power tradeoffs. This is the
   first attempt to develop a design flow to apply high-level
   transformations that not only meet these tradeoffs but also
   simultaneously obfuscate the architectures both structurally and
   functionally. Several modes of operations are introduced for obfuscation
   where the outputs are meaningful from a signal processing point of view,
   but are functionally incorrect. Examples of such modes include a
   third-order digital filter that can also implement a sixth-order or
   ninth-order filter in a time-multiplexed manner. The latter two modes
   are meaningful but represent functionally incorrect modes. Multiple
   meaningful modes can be exploited to reconfigure the filter order for
   different applications. Other modes may correspond to nonmeaningful
   modes. A correct key input to an FSM activates a reconfigurator. The
   configure data controls various modes of the circuit operation.
   Functional obfuscation is accomplished by requiring use of the correct
   initialization key, and configure data. Wrong initialization key fails
   to enable the reconfigurator, and a wrong configure data activates
   either a meaningful but nonfunctional or nonmeaningful mode. Probability
   of activating the correct mode is significantly reduced leading to an
   obfuscated DSP circuit. Structural obfuscation is also achieved by the
   proposed methodology via high-level transformations. Experimental
   results show that the overhead of the proposed methodology is small,
   while a strong obfuscation is attained. For example, the area overhead
   for a (3l) th-order IIR filter benchmark is only 17.7\% with a 128-bit
   configuration key, where 1 <= l <= 8, i.e., the order of this filter
   should be a multiple of 3, and can vary from 3 to 24.}},

Title = {{An Experimental Investigation of Reactivity-Controlled Compression
   Ignition Combustion in a Single-Cylinder Diesel Engine Using Hydrous
   Ethanol}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENERGY RESOURCES TECHNOLOGY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Dual-fuel reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion
   using port injection of a less reactive fuel and early-cycle direct
   injection (DI) of a more reactive fuel has been shown to yield both high
   thermal efficiency and low NOX and soot emissions over a wide engine
   operating range. Conventional and alternative fuels such as gasoline,
   natural gas, and E85 as the lower reactivity fuel in RCCI have been
   studied by many researchers; however, published experimental
   investigations of hydrous ethanol use in RCCI are scarce. Making greater
   use of hydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines has the potential
   to dramatically improve the economics and life cycle carbon dioxide
   emissions of using bioethanol. In this work, an experimental
   investigation was conducted using 150 proof hydrous ethanol as the low
   reactivity fuel and commercially available diesel as the high reactivity
   fuel in an RCCI combustion mode at various load conditions. A modified
   single-cylinder diesel engine was used for the experiments. Based on
   previous studies on RCCI combustion by other researchers, early-cycle
   split-injection strategy of diesel fuel was used to create an
   in-cylinder fuel reactivity distribution to maintain high thermal
   efficiency and low NOX and soot emissions. At each load condition,
   timing and mass fraction of the first diesel injection was held
   constant, while timing of the second diesel injection was swept over a
   range where stable combustion could be maintained. Since hydrous ethanol
   is highly resistant to auto-ignition and has large heat of vaporization,
   intake air heating was needed to obtain stable operations of the engine.
   The study shows that 150 proof hydrous ethanol can be used as the low
   reactivity fuel in RCCI through 8.6 bar indicated mean effective
   pressure (IMEP) and with ethanol energy fraction up to 75\% while
   achieving simultaneously low levels of NOX and soot emissions. With
   increasing engine load, less intake heating is needed and exhaust gas
   recirculation (EGR) is required to maintain low NOX emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is a natural hyperbolic material, which

   In this paper, we examine theoretically the mid-infrared optical
   properties of graphenehBN heterostructures derived from their coupled
   plasmonphonon modes. We find that the graphene plasmon couples
   differently with the phonons of the two Reststrahlen bands, owing to
   their different hyperbolicity. This also leads to distinctively
   different interaction between an external quantum emitter and the
   plasmonphonon modes in the two bands, leading to substantial
   modification of its spectrum. The coupling to graphene plasmons allows
   for additional gate tunability in the Purcell factor and narrow dips in
   its emission spectra.}},

Pages = {{335-346}},

Abstract = {{Results are presented from four non-prestressed concrete slab-column
   connection subassemblies tested under simulated gravity and
   earthquake-type loading. Each specimen consisted of a large-scale
   first-story interior slab-column connection reinforced with headed shear
   studs, loaded to a gravity-shear ratio of 50\%, and subjected to biaxial
   lateral displacements. The slabs, which were nominally identical aside
   from the shear stud reinforcement design, had a flexural reinforcement
   ratio in the column strip, based on the effective depth, of 0.7\%. Shear
   stud reinforcement in the test specimens varied in terms of amount and
   spacing, both between and within stud peripheral lines.
   All four specimens exhibited drift capacities significantly lower than
   shown by previous studies. Although the lateral strength of the
   specimens was governed by the flexural capacity of the slab, severe
   concrete degradation ultimately limited the drift capacity of the
   connections. Signs of punching-related damage were first observed during
   the cycle to 1.85\% drift in each loading direction. Test results
   suggest that the minimum amount of shear reinforcement required in
   Section 21.13.6 of ACI 318-11 when neither a drift nor a combined
   shear-stress check is performed (v(s) >= 3.5 root f(c)' psi {[}0.29 root
   f(c)' MPa]) is adequate for connections subjected to a gravity shear
   ratio of up to 50\% and resultant drifts from biaxial displacements of
   up to 2.0\% if studs are spaced at less than 2d within the first two
   peripheral lines. For larger drift demands, a maximum stud spacing
   within the first three peripheral lines of 1.5d is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a novel approach to optimal broadcast scheduling for
   an energy-harvesting powered transmitter with non-ideal circuit power
   consumption. Relying on the uplink-downlink duality and convex
   optimization tools, the proposed approach provides low-complexity
   algorithms to obtain the optimal transmission policies that maximize the
   weighted sum-throughput for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) broadcast
   channels. For both time-invariant and time-varying channels, it is
   revealed that the optimal transmission between any two consecutive
   channel or energy state changing instants, termed epoch, can only take
   one of the three strategies: 1) no transmission; 2) transmission with an
   energy-efficiency (EE) maximizing sum-power over part of the epoch; or
   3) transmission with a sum-power greater than the EE-maximizing power
   over the whole epoch. The proposed approach can provide the optimal
   benchmarks for practical schemes in energy-harvesting MIMO broadcast
   transmissions, and can be employed to develop efficient online
   scheduling schemes which require only causal knowledge of energy arrival
   realizations.}},

Title = {{Network-based Phenome-Genome Association Prediction by Bi-Random Walk}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Motivation
   The availability of ontologies and systematic documentations of
   phenotypes and their genetic associations has enabled large-scale
   network-based global analyses of the association between the complete
   collection of phenotypes (phenome) and genes. To provide a fundamental
   understanding of how the network information is relevant to
   phenotype-gene associations, we analyze the circular bigraphs (CBGs) in
   OMIM human disease phenotype-gene association network and MGI mouse
   phentoype-gene association network, and introduce a bi-random walk
   (BiRW) algorithm to capture the CBG patterns in the networks for
   unveiling human and mouse phenome-genome association. BiRW performs
   separate random walk simultaneously on gene interaction network and
   phenotype similarity network to explore gene paths and phenotype paths
   in CBGs of different sizes to summarize their associations as
   predictions.
   Results
   The analysis of both OMIM and MGI associations revealed that majority of
   the phenotypegene associations are covered by CBG patterns of small path
   lengths, and there is a clear correlation between the CBG coverage and
   the predictability of the phenotype-gene associations. In the
   experiments on recovering known associations in cross-validations on
   human disease phenotypes and mouse phenotypes, BiRW effectively improved
   prediction performance over the compared methods. The constructed global
   human disease phenome-genome association map also revealed interesting
   new predictions and phenotype-gene modules by disease classes.}},

Abstract = {{The APOBEC family of single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminases comprises a
   formidable arm of the vertebrate innate immune system. Pre-vertebrates
   express a single APOBEC, whereas some mammals produce as many as 11
   enzymes. The APOBEC3 subfamily displays both copy number variation and
   polymorphisms, consistent with ongoing pathogenic pressures. These
   enzymes restrict the replication of many DNA-based parasites, such as
   exogenous viruses and endogenous transposable elements. APOBEC1 and
   activation-induced cytosine deaminase (AID) have specialized functions
   in RNA editing and antibody gene diversification, respectively, whereas
   APOBEC2 and APOBEC4 appear to have different functions. Nevertheless,
   the APOBEC family protects against both periodic viral zoonoses as well
   as exogenous and endogenous parasite replication. This review.
   highlights viral pathogens that are restricted by APOBEC enzymes, but
   manage to escape through unique mechanisms. The sensitivity of viruses
   that lack counterdefense measures highlights the need to develop
   APOBEC-enabling small molecules as a new class of anti-viral drugs. (C)

Abstract = {{High carrier mobility and tunability in graphene enable fundamental
   studies for plasmonics and various applications. Despite its
   versatility, however, single-layer graphene (SLG) suffers from poor
   coupling efficiency to electromagnetic waves, presenting a major
   challenge for photonic applications. Compared with visible or infrared
   radiation, terahertz (THz) waves exhibit higher absorption in SLG due to
   Drude-like intraband transitions, but the wavelength-to-SLG size
   mismatch becomes even more dramatic. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
   99\% extinction of THz wave transmission when SLG covers the openings of
   2-nm-wide (approximate to lambda/1 000 000) slits through a metal film.
   By resonantly coupling THz waves through annular nanogaps, the extremely
   localized fields lead to near-perfect extinction and strong absorption
   in SLG. Atomic-layer lithography is used to produce these
   nanometer-wide, millimeter-long gaps over an entire 4-in. wafer.
   Furthermore, by integrating these devices with an ionic liquid, enhanced
   intraband absorption in the SLG leads to 80\% modulation of THz waves
   with an operational voltage as low as 1.5 V.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Crowdsourcing is the practice of obtaining services from a
   large group of people, typically an online community. Validated methods
   of evaluating surgical video are time-intensive, expensive, and involve
   participation of multiple expert surgeons. We sought to obtain valid
   performance scores of urologic trainees and faculty on a dry-laboratory
   robotic surgery task module by using crowdsourcing through a web-based
   grading tool called Crowd Sourced Assessment of Technical Skill (CSATS).
   Methods: IRB approval was granted to test the technical skills grading
   accuracy of Amazon.com Mechanical Turk crowd-workers compared to three
   expert faculty surgeon graders. The two groups assessed dry-laboratory
   robotic surgical suturing performances of three urology residents
   (PGY-2, -4, -5) and two faculty using three performance domains from the
   validated Global Evaluative Assessment of Robotic Skills assessment
   tool. Results: After an average of 2 hours 50 minutes, each of the five
   videos received 50 crowd-worker assessments. The inter-rater reliability
   (IRR) between the surgeons and crowd was 0.91 using Cronbach's alpha
   statistic (confidence intervals=0.20-0.92), indicating an agreement
   level between the two groups of excellent. The crowds were able to
   discriminate the surgical level, and both the crowds and the expert
   faculty surgeon graders scored one senior trainee's performance above a
   faculty's performance. Conclusion: Surgery-naive crowd-workers can
   rapidly assess varying levels of surgical skill accurately relative to a
   panel of faculty raters. The crowds provided rapid feedback and were
   inexpensive. CSATS may be a valuable adjunct to surgical simulation
   training as requirements for more granular and iterative performance
   tracking of trainees become mandated and commonplace.}},

Abstract = {{We present a numerical method for calculating inhomogeneous refractive
   index fields in rectangular gradientindex (GRIN) elements from measured
   boundary positions and slopes of a collection of rays that transit the
   medium. The inverse problem is reduced to a set of linear algebraic
   equations after approximating ray trajectories from the measured
   boundary values and is solved using a pseudo-inverse algorithm for
   sparse linear equations. The ray trajectories are subsequently corrected
   using an iterative ray trace procedure to ensure consistency in the
   solution. We demonstrate our method in simulation by reconstructing a
   hypothetical rectangular GRIN element on a 15 x 15 discrete grid using
   800 interrogating rays, in which RMS refractive index errors less than
   0.5\% of the index range (n(max) - n(min)) are achieved. Furthermore, we
   identify three primary sources of error and assess the importance of
   data redundancy and system conditioning in the reconstruction process.

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe continued growth in the uses of umbilical cord blood (UCB)
   will require the development of meaningful postthaw quality assays. This
   study examines both conventional and new measures for assessing UCB
   quality after long-term storage.
   Study Design and MethodsThe first arm of the study involved thawing UCB
   in storage for short (approx. 1 year) and long periods of time (>11
   years). Conventional postthaw measures (colony-forming units {[}CFU],
   total nucleated cell counts, CD34+45+) were quantified in addition to
   apoptosis. The second arm of the study involved taking units stored in
   liquid nitrogen and imposing a storage lesion by storing the units in
   -80 degrees C for various periods of time. After storage lesion, the
   units were thawed and assessed.
   ResultsIn the first arm of the study, there was little difference in the
   postthaw measures between UCB stored for short and long periods of time.
   There was a slight increase in the percentage of CD34+45+ cells with
   time in storage and a reduction in the number of cells expressing
   apoptosis markers. When moved from liquid nitrogen to -80 degrees C
   storage, the nucleated cell count varied little but there was a distinct
   decrease in frequency of CFUs and increase in percentage of cells
   expressing both early and late markers of apoptosis.
   ConclusionNucleated cell counts do not reflect damage to hematopoietic
   progenitors during long-term storage. Expression of caspases and other
   markers of apoptosis provide an early biomarker of damage during
   storage, which is consistent with other measures such as CFU and
   percentage of CD34+45+ cells.}},

Abstract = {{While electric vehicles (EVs) are expected to provide environmental and
   economical benefit, judicious coordination of EV charging is necessary
   to prevent overloading of the distribution grid. Leveraging the smart
   grid infrastructure, the utility company can adjust the electricity
   price intelligently for individual customers to elicit desirable load
   curves. In this context, this paper addresses the problem of predicting
   the EV charging behavior of the consumers at different prices, which is
   a prerequisite for optimal price adjustment. The dependencies on price
   responsiveness among consumers are captured by a conditional random
   field (CRF) model. To account for temporal dynamics potentially in a
   strategic setting, the framework of online convex optimization is
   adopted to develop an efficient online algorithm for tracking the CRF
   parameters. The proposed model is then used as an input to a stochastic
   profit maximization module for real-time price setting. Numerical tests
   using simulated and semi-real data verify the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach.}},

Title = {{Water concentration distribution in coatings during accelerated
   weathering protocols}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COATINGS TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{477-487}},

Abstract = {{The long outdoor service life of painted metal and wood objects, often
   measured in decades, requires the use of accelerated weathering
   protocols to predict the long-term efficacy and performance of new
   barrier protective coating candidates. The mechanism of damage imposed
   on a coating system in accelerated weathering tests must have parity
   with the damage mechanisms occurring within the system as it undergoes
   natural, in-service weathering. Similarly, the physical conditions
   involved in the accelerated exposure regime, including water
   distribution as it is defined both temporally and spatially, must show
   equivalency to the natural exposure regime. An added complication in
   accurately accelerating coating damage is that the wet and dry cycles of
   accelerated weathering and corrosion test protocols are often performed
   at different and elevated temperatures from in-service exposure, which
   results in altered bulk transport and diffusion rates of water during
   each phase of the weathering or corrosion protocol, when compared to
   those rates experienced in field or in-service conditions. In this
   study, Fick's law of diffusion is applied to coating surfaces exposed to
   surface water concentrations at cyclical intervals for a set of
   two-stage accelerated weathering protocols. The governing equations are
   solved using Laplace transforms followed by time rescaling to account
   for the variation in temperature, which impacts the diffusion
   coefficient between the wet and dry portions of several accelerated
   weathering protocols. This serves to predict the asymptotic average
   water concentration within the coating as well as at the coating-metal
   interface, based on the diffusion and temperature parameters of the
   coating and the parameters of the accelerated weathering protocol,
   including the duration of each imposed wet or dry stage. The analytic
   solution to Fick's second law also allows the water concentration at the
   substrate-coating interface to be predicted based on Arrhenius
   parameters of the diffusion process. This resultant average time of
   wetness and water concentration variance at the coating-substrate
   interface can be used to more directly compare corrosion and adhesion
   loss between various accelerated weathering protocols and natural
   weathering conditions. The numerical average and range of water
   concentration as a function of coating depth can then be used to
   interpret coating damage distribution with depth, and enable more
   insightful comparison of the results of various accelerated weathering
   protocols. The simulations indicate that good barrier systems may
   actually exhibit increased barrier properties in accelerated protocols
   as compared to systems with mediocre or poor barrier performance as
   determined by global diffusion coefficients. The good barrier coating
   imparts substantially less exposure challenge to the interface than the
   mediocre or poor barrier coatings in accelerated weathering protocols.
   Therefore, in industry-standard tests, the observed performance gain of
   good barrier coating systems over poor systems may be unduly
   exaggerated. However, the overall exposure challenge to the interface of
   a good barrier coating is likely to be larger in service or field
   conditions due to the much extended time of wet exposure. Thus,
   laboratory-accelerated weathering cycles that do not consider the impact
   of temporal and spatial diffusion could potentially misrepresent the
   quality of a coating, in most cases overestimating the performance of
   coatings with good baseline barrier protection for adhesion or corrosion
   protection.
   In other words, the accelerated weathering protocols do not equally
   challenge the interface of different coatings operating in the same
   in-service conditions.}},

   influences genome stability and gene expression. The Ty1 retrotransposon
   of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae integrates upstream of RNA
   polymerase III (Pol III)-transcribed genes, yet the primary determinant
   of target specificity has remained elusive. Here we describe an
   interaction between Ty1 integrase and the AC40 subunit of Pol III and
   demonstrate that AC40 is the predominant determinant targeting Ty1
   integration upstream of Pol III-transcribed genes. Lack of an
   integrase-AC40 interaction dramatically alters target site choice,
   leading to a redistribution of Ty1 insertions in the genome, mainly to
   chromosome ends. The mechanism of target specificity allows Ty1 to
   proliferate and yet minimizes genetic damage to its host.}},

Abstract = {{We present an interactive algorithm to model physics-based interactions
   in dense crowds. Our approach is capable of modeling both physical
   forces and interactions between agents and obstacles, while also
   allowing the agents to anticipate and avoid upcoming collisions during
   local navigation. We combine velocity-based collision-avoidance
   algorithms with external physical forces. The overall formulation
   produces various effects of forces acting on agents and crowds,
   including balance recovery motion and force propagation through the
   crowd. We further extend our method to model more complex behaviors
   involving social and cultural rules. We use finite-state machines to
   specify a series of behaviors and demonstrate our approach on many
   complex scenarios. Our algorithm can simulate a few thousand agents at
   interactive rates and can generate many emergent behaviors.}},

Abstract = {{A nitrifying biofilm was grown in a laboratory-scale membrane aerated
   bioreactor (MABR) to calibrate and test a one-dimensional biofilm model
   incorporating chemical equilibria to calculate local pH values. A
   previously developed model (Shanahan and Semmens, 2004) based upon
   AQUASIM was modified to incorporate the impact of local pH changes
   within the biofilm on the kinetics of nitrification. Shielded
   microelectrodes were used to measure the concentration profiles of
   dissolved oxygen, ammonium, nitrate, and pH within the biofilm and the
   overlying boundary layer under actual operating conditions. Operating
   conditions were varied to assess the impact of bicarbonate loading
   (alkalinity), ammonium loading, and intra-membrane oxygen partial
   pressure on biofilm performance.
   Nitrification performance improved with increased ammonium and
   bicarbonate loadings over the range of operating conditions tested, but
   declined when the intra-membrane oxygen partial pressure was increased.
   Minor discrepancies between the measured and predicted concentration
   profiles within the biofilm were attributed to changes in biofilm
   density and vertical heterogeneities in biofilm structure not accounted
   for by the model. Nevertheless, predicted concentration profiles within
   the biofilm agreed well with experimental results over the range of
   conditions studied and highlight the fact that pH changes in the biofilm
   are significant especially in low alkalinity waters. The influent pH and
   buffer capacity of a wastewater may therefore have a significant impact
   on the performance of a membrane-aerated bioreactor with respect to
   nitrification, and nitrogen removal. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The variables that influence the in vitro recellularization potential of
   decellularized engineered tissues, such as cell culture conditions and
   scaffold alignment, have yet to be explored. The goal of this work was
   to explore the influence of insulin and ascorbic acid and extracellular
   matrix (ECM) alignment on the recellularization of decellularized
   engineered tissue by human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs). Aligned and
   non-aligned tissues were created by specifying the geometry and
   associated mechanical constraints to fibroblast-mediated fibrin gel
   contraction and remodelling using circular and C-shaped moulds.
   Decellularized tissues (matrices) of the same alignment were created by
   decellularization with detergents. Ascorbic acid promoted the invasion
   of hMSCs into the matrices due to a stimulated increase in motility and
   proliferation. Invasion correlated with hyaluronic acid secretion,
   -smooth muscle actin expression and decreased matrix thickness.
   Furthermore, hMSCs invasion into aligned and non-aligned matrices was
   not different, although there was a difference in cell orientation.
   Finally, we show that hMSCs on the matrix surface appear to
   differentiate toward a smooth muscle cell or myofibroblast phenotype
   with ascorbic acid treatment. These results inform the strategy of
   recellularizing decellularized engineered tissue with hMSCs. Copyright

Title = {{Influence of Hyphal Inoculum potential on the Competitive Success of

Volume = {{69}},

Pages = {{758-767}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The relative amounts of hyphal inoculum in forest soils may determine
   the capacity for fungi to compete with and replace early colonizers of
   wood in ground contact. Our aim in this study was to test the
   flexibility of priority effects (colonization timing) by varying the
   timing of inoculum introduction (i.e., precolonization) and amount of
   inoculum (i.e., inoculum potential). We controlled these variables in
   soil-block microcosms using fungi with known competitive outcomes in
   similar conditions, tracking isolate-specific fungal biomass, and
   residue physiochemistry over time. In the precolonization trial
   (experiment I), a brown rot fungus Gloeophyllum trabeum was given 1, 3,
   or 5 weeks to precolonize wood blocks (oak, birch, pine, and spruce)
   prior the introduction of a white rot fungus, Irpex lacteus, a more
   aggressive colonizer in this set-up. In the inoculum potential trial
   (experiment II), the fungi were inoculated simultaneously, but with
   eightfold higher brown rot inoculum than that of experiment I. As
   expected, longer precolonization duration increased the chance for the
   less-competitive brown rot fungus to outcompete its white rot opponent.
   Higher brown rot fungal inoculum outside of the wood matrix also
   resulted in competitive success for the brown rot isolate in most cases.
   These temporal shifts in fungal dominance were detectable in a
   `community snapshot' as isolate-specific quantitative PCR, but also as
   functionally-relevant consequences of wood rot type, including
   carbohydrate depolymerization and pH. These results from a controlled
   system reinforce fungal-fungal interaction and suggest that relative
   inoculum availability beyond the wood matrix (i.e., soils) might
   regulate the duration of priority effects and shift the functional
   trajectory of wood decomposition.}},

Title = {{Design of optimal ecosystem monitoring networks: hotspot detection and

Journal = {{STOCHASTIC ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND RISK ASSESSMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1085-1101}},

Abstract = {{Effective monitoring of ecosystems is crucial for assessing and possibly
   anticipating shifts, quantifying ecosystem services, and optimal
   decision making based on shifts and services. The selection of
   monitoring sites is typically suboptimal following local stakeholder or
   research interests that do not allow to capture ecosystem patterns and
   dynamics as a whole. The design of optimal monitoring network is crucial
   for the accurate determination of biodiversity patterns of ecosystems. A
   novel model for the design of optimal monitoring networks for
   biodiversity based on the concept of the value of information (VoI) is
   proposed. The VoI is assigned to species richness that is the
   economically and ecologically valuable metric. As a case study the
   trinational frontier ecosystem among Brazil, Peru, and Bolivia is
   considered for the model. A multiresolution texture-based model
   estimates species richness and turnover on satellite imagery calibrated
   on different sets of information coming from forest plot data organized
   in network topologies. The optimal monitoring network is the network
   that minimizes the integrated VoI defined as the variation of the VoI in
   the 28 years considered. This is equivalent to minimize the sum of the
   species turnover of the ecosystem. The small world network is identified
   as the optimal and most resilient monitoring network whose nodes are the
   hotspots of species richness. The hotspots are identified as the sites
   whose VoI is the highest for the whole period considered. Hence, the
   hotspots are the most valuable communities for inferring biodiversity
   patterns and the most ecologically/economically valuable according to
   the richness-resilience hypothesis. Most hotspots are honored by the
   small world network that can be thought as the ``backbone{''} ecological
   network of the ecosystem. The small world monitoring network has an
   accuracy similar to 50 \% higher than other network topologies in
   predicting biodiversity patterns. This network has the highest VoI at
   any time step and scale considered; thus, it guarantees to track changes
   of ecosystems in space and time. The network that results from the
   optimal trade-off between data value with their uncertainty and
   relevance, has deep implications for understanding ecosystem function
   and for management decisions. The model allows to include preferences
   for ecosystem communities by using differential weights on the VoI of
   these communities, and economic constraints that limit the extension of
   the network. Because of the optimal integration of environmental,
   social, and economical factors the model allows a sustainable monitoring
   and planning of biodiversity for the future.}},

Abstract = {{Self-pillared pentasil (SPP) zeolite is a hierarchically-structured
   zeolite comprised of single-unit cell thick MFI nanosheets arranged in a
   ``house of cards{''} structure. The nucleation and growth of SPP
   proceeds through three phases involving the evolution of precursor
   amorphous nanoparticles to MFI nanosheets and then rotational
   intergrowth of sheets to produce the SPP morphology. This paper expands
   upon an earlier report to extend understanding of nucleation and growth
   events throughout the entire preparation process, from hydrolysis of the
   silica source to high conversion to crystals. Common aspects with the
   extensively investigated clear-sol silicalite-1 system are identified.
   Evaporation of co-solvent ethanol was found to accelerate the
   crystallization significantly. Furthermore, robust synthesis of SPP with
   high density of well-developed single-unit cell domains has been
   achieved with addition of potassium and sodium to the synthesis sols.}},

Abstract = {{First, one- and two-compartment models of the chest wall are reviewed.
   Then, a three-compartment model is described, and the predictions of the
   model are compared with data on pressure and volume relationships for
   different breathing maneuvers in dogs. Finally, the three-compartment
   model is scaled to apply to humans, and dynamic solutions for periodic
   breathing are obtained. To model COPD, the area of the zone of
   apposition is decreased, and to model COPD patients who show Hoover's
   sign, pulmonary resistance and abdominal compliance are increased. The
   resulting traces match those reported by Binazzi et al. (2008. Respir.
   Physiol. Neurobiol. 160:325-333) for controls and patients with COPD,
   both without and with Hoover's sign. We conclude that Hoover's sign is a
   dynamic phenomenon that results from the decrease in the area of the
   zone of apposition that occurs in COPD and a larger pulmonary resistance
   and abdominal compliance in those patients who show Hoover's sign. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper revisits blind source separation of instantaneously mixed
   quasi-stationary sources (BSS-QSS), motivated by the observation that in
   certain applications (e.g., speech) there exist time frames during which
   only one source is active, or locally dominant. Combined with
   nonnegativity of source powers, this endows the problem with a nice
   convex geometry that enables elegant and efficient BSS solutions. Local
   dominance is tantamount to the so-called pure pixel/separability
   assumption in hyperspectral unmixing/nonnegative matrix factorization,
   respectively. Building on this link, a very simple algorithm called
   successive projection algorithm (SPA) is considered for estimating the
   mixing system in closed form. To complement SPA in the specific BSS-QSS
   context, an algebraic preprocessing procedure is proposed to suppress
   short-term source cross-correlation interference. The proposed procedure
   is simple, effective, and supported by theoretical analysis. Solutions
   based on volume minimization (VolMin) are also considered. By
   theoretical analysis, it is shown that VolMin guarantees perfect mixing
   system identifiability under an assumption more relaxed than (exact)
   local dominance-which means wider applicability in practice. Exploiting
   the specific structure of BSS-QSS, a fast VolMin algorithm is proposed
   for the overdetermined case. Careful simulations using real speech
   sources showcase the simplicity, efficiency, and accuracy of the
   proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Knowledge is limited about fluid flow in tissues containing engineered
   microvessels, which can be substantially different in topology than
   native capillary networks. A need exists for a computational model that
   allows for flow through tissues dense in nonpercolating and possibly
   nonperfusable microvessels to be efficiently evaluated. A finite
   difference (FD) model based on Poiseuille flow through a distribution of
   straight tubes acting as point sources and sinks, and Darcy flow through
   the interstitium, was developed to describe fluid flow through a tissue
   containing engineered microvessels. Accuracy of the FD model was
   assessed by comparison to a finite element (FE) model for the case of a
   single tube. Because the case of interest is a tissue with microvessels
   aligned with the flow, accuracy was also assessed in depth for a
   corresponding 2D FD model. The potential utility of the 2D FD model was
   then explored by correlating metrics of flow through the model tissue to
   microvessel morphometric properties. The results indicate that the model
   can predict the density of perfused microvessels based on parameters
   that can be easily measured.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptomics is increasingly being used on Chinese hamster ovary
   (CHO) cells to unveil physiological insights related to their
   performance during production processes. The rich transcriptome data can
   be exploited to provide impetus for systems investigation such as
   modeling the central carbon metabolism or glycosylation pathways, or
   even building genome-scale models. To harness the power of transcriptome
   assays, we assembled and annotated a set of RNA-Seq data from multiple
   CHO cell lines and Chinese hamster tissues, and constructed a DNA
   microarray. The identity of genes involved in major functional pathways
   and their transcript levels generated in this study will serve as a
   reference for future studies employing kinetic models. In particular,
   the data on glycolysis and glycosylation pathways indicate that the
   variability of gene expression level among different cell lines and
   tissues may contribute to their differences in metabolism and
   glycosylation patterns. Thereby, these insights can potentially lead to
   opportunities for cell engineering. This repertoire of transcriptome
   data also enables the identification of potential sequence variants in
   cell lines and allows tracing of cell lineages. Overall the study is an
   illustration of the potential benefit of RNA-Seq that is yet to be
   exploited. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2015;112: 965-976. (c) 2014 Wiley

Pages = {{423-457}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with the computation of the principal components
   for a general tensor, known as the tensor principal component analysis
   (PCA) problem. We show that the general tensor PCA problem is reducible
   to its special case where the tensor in question is super-symmetric with
   an even degree. In that case, the tensor can be embedded into a
   symmetric matrix. We prove that if the tensor is rank-one, then the
   embedded matrix must be rank-one too, and vice versa. The tensor PCA
   problem can thus be solved by means of matrix optimization under a
   rank-one constraint, for which we propose two solution methods: (1)
   imposing a nuclear norm penalty in the objective to enforce a low-rank
   solution; (2) relaxing the rank-one constraint by semidefinite
   programming. Interestingly, our experiments show that both methods can
   yield a rank-one solution for almost all the randomly generated
   instances, in which case solving the original tensor PCA problem to
   optimality. To further cope with the size of the resulting convex
   optimization models, we propose to use the alternating direction method
   of multipliers, which reduces significantly the computational efforts.
   Various extensions of the model are considered as well.}},

Abstract = {{Characterization and theoretical description of relatively large ( > 100
   nm), asymmetric magnetic particles remain of interest particularly for
   applications to the mechanical damage of cells. In this work, we have
   examined the properties of three types of magnetite, Fe3O4, particles
   that were prepared by hydrogen reduction of hematite, alpha-Fe2O3.
   Transmission electron microscopy was used to measure the size and aspect
   ratio (AR), which were 1.8, 3.4 and 6.6, and all displayed magnetic
   hysteresis with corresponding saturation magnetization values of 65, 47,
   and 26 emu/g. respectively. With application of an alternating magnetic
   field to low concentrations, the temperature increased linearly with
   Lime, and the specific loss power (SLP) increased with increasing aspect
   ratio with values of 11.8, 24, and 26.8 Wig. The SLP increased linearly
   with the square of the applied magnetic field at low concentrations, but
   deviations were noted for high concentrations of the 2.4 and 6.6 AR
   particles. SLP was also dependent on frequency, but the functional
   relationship was not reliably determined. In consideration of the
   possible heating mechanisms, none provided a satisfactorily explanation
   for all types of particles. While these particles are not satisfactory
   for magnetic hyperthermia, they may have promise for causing cell death
   by magnetically inducing the particles to physically rotate or vibrate.

Abstract = {{The surface chemistry of silica is strongly affected by the nature of
   chemically active sites (or defects) occurring on the surface. Here, we
   employ quantum mechanical electronic structure calculations to study an
   uncoordinated silicon defect, a non-bridging oxygen defect, and a
   peroxyl defect on the reconstructed (0001) surface of a-quartz. We
   characterized the spin states and energies of the defects, and
   calculated the reaction profiles for atomic oxygen recombination at the
   defects. We elucidated the diradical character by analyzing the
   low-lying excited states using multireference wave function methods. We
   show that the diradical defects consist of weakly coupled doublet
   radicals, and the atomic oxygen recombination can take place through a
   barrierless process at defects. We have delineated the recombination
   mechanism and computed the formation energy of the peroxyl and
   non-bridging oxygen defects. We found that key recombination reaction
   paths are barrierless. In addition, we characterize the electronically
   excited states that may play a role in the chemical and physical
   processes that occur during recombination on these surface defect sites.}},

Abstract = {{The harmonized monograph on tablet friability test in United States
   Pharmacopeia (USP), European Pharmacopeia (Pharm. Eur.), and Japanese
   Pharmacopeia (JP) is designed to assess adequacy of mechanical strength
   of a batch of tablets. Currently, its potential applications in
   formulation development have been limited due to the batch requirement
   that is both labor and material intensive. To this end, we have
   developed an expedited tablet friability test method, using the existing
   USP test apparatus. The validity of the expedited friability method is
   established by showing that the friability data from the expedited
   method is not statistically different from those from the standard
   pharmacopeia method using materials of very different mechanical
   properties, i.e., microcrystalline cellulose and dibasic calcium
   phosphate dihydrate. Using the expedited friability method, we have
   shown that the relationship between tablet friability and tablet
   mechanical strength follows a power law expression. Furthermore,
   potential applications of this expedited friability test in facilitating
   systematic and efficient tablet formulation and tooling design are
   demonstrated with examples. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper assesses the impact of energy integration on the dynamics of
   batch process systems. Using a prototype example of an integrated batch
   reactor, it is shown that such systems give rise to network-level
   dynamics-a characteristic feature of integrated process networks. The
   network dynamics is nonlinear, evolves at a slower time scale, and is
   more pronounced in the limit of tight energy integration. Furthermore,
   it is illustrated that these dynamic characteristics are independent of
   the (direct or indirect) mode of energy integtation. Lastly, the
   significance of this network dynamics on the optimal operatitin of suth
   Systems is also demonstrated.}},

   Triblock Copolymer Micelles}},
Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},

Abstract = {{The effect of polymer architecture on molecular exchange in block
   copolymer micelles has been investigated using time-resolved small-angle
   neutron scattering (TR-SANS). Narrowly dispersed symmetric PEP-PS-PEP
   and PS-PEP-PS triblock copolymers were synthesized, where PS and PEP
   refer to poly(styrene) and poly(ethylene-alt-propylene), respectively.
   Spherical micelles of the triblocks in squalane, a selective solvent for
   the PEP blocks, were prepared using a cosolvent method. PEP-PS-PEP forms
   hairy micelles with the PS blocks looped in the cores, while PSPEPPS
   forms flower-like micelles with most of the PEP blocks looped in the
   corona. The micelle structure was characterized by small-angle X-ray
   scattering, providing in particular the core radius as a function of
   temperature. TR-SANS experiments were conducted on solutions containing
   1 and 6 vol \% PEP-PS-PEP, and 0.25 and 0.5 vol \% PS-PEP-PEP, using
   matched pairs of deuterium-labeled (dPS) and normal (hPS) specimens and
   a mixture of normal and perdeuterated squalane contrast-matched to
   uniformly mixed hPS/dPS micelle cores. Blends of micelles with initially
   pure hPS and dPS cores produce scattering intensity that decays with the
   redistribution of block copolymer chains as a function of time,
   providing direct access to the rate of molecular exchange. Remarkably,
   the two triblock architectures display exchange rates that differ by
   approximately 9 orders of magnitude, even though the solvophobic PS
   blocks are of comparable size. This discovery is considered in the
   context of a model that successfully explained the exchange dynamics in
   PS-PEP diblock copolymer micelles.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and characterization of poly(dimethylaminoethyl
   methacrylate)-block-poly(styrene) (PDMAEMA-b-PS) diblock copolymers by
   RAFT polymerization. These polymers form uniform spherical micelles with
   dispersities less than 0.05 upon addition of aqueous buffer to polymer
   solutions in DMF. Potentiometric titrations under constant ionic
   strength conditions yield the first rigorous ionic-strength-effective
   pK(a) correspondence for PDMAEMA homopolymers and micelles. We
   demonstrate that the effective polymer pK(a) increases monotonically
   toward the monomer pK(a) with increasing ionic strength, but decreases
   slightly upon association of polymer chains into micelles. We further
   characterize the pH- and ionic-strength-induced contraction of the
   micelle coronas in buffered aqueous solutions. In monoprotic buffers,
   the micelle corona behaves as a salted osmotic brush, as has been
   observed for other block polyelectrolyte micelle systems in unbuffered
   solutions. In polyprotic buffers, however, we observe an anomalously
   high degree of corona contraction. We demonstrate through a simple
   two-domain equilibrium model that this contraction likely arises from
   concentration of the charged buffer species in the micelle corona, which
   shifts the buffer dissociation equilibrium farther toward multivalent
   species than in the bulk.}},

Abstract = {{We present a detailed quantitative comparison of experimental results
   and theoretical predictions for the structure and thermodynamics of low
   molecular weight symmetric (f(L) approximate to 1/2)
   poly(1,4-isoprene-b-DL-lactide) (IL) diblock copolymers near the order
   disorder transition (ODT). Small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering
   (SANS and SAXS) Measurements obtained in the disordered phase with IL
   degree of polymerization N = 39 were fit to the renormalized one-loop
   (ROL) theory in order to estimate the effective interaction parameter
   chi(e)(T). Calorimetric Measurements of the latent heat of the ODT for
   the same copolymer compare well with that obtained front corresponding
   coarse-grained simulations, when the comparison is based on this
   estimate of chi(e)(T). The corresponding estimate of (chi N-e)(ODT) at
   the experimental ODT of this polymer is much closer to the value
   obtained from simulations than to any theoretical prediction but differs
   from the simulation result by somewhat more than the bounds implied by
   experimental uncertainties. A larger discrepancy between simulation and
   experimental results for (chi N-e)(ODT) is obtained for longer chains,
   with N >= 50, when also calculated using chi(e)(T, N = 39). We discuss
   possible reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility of a
   significant end-group effect for these polymers. These results confirm
   the overwhelming importance of fluctuation effects in short diblock
   copolymers, and the usefulness of coarse-grained simulations as a
   starting point for quantitative modeling, but also indicate the need for
   attention to nonuniversal features of specific polymers that can also
   become more important with decreasing chain length.}},

Abstract = {{We compute the axial diffusivity of asymptotically long semiflexible
   polymers confined in square channels. Our calculations employ the
   Kirkwood approximation of the mobility tensor by combining computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations of the hydrodynamic tensor in channel
   confinement with the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM)
   simulations of a discrete wormlike chain model. Three key results emerge
   from our study. First, for the classic de Gennes regime, we confirm that
   Brochard and de Gennes blob theory correctly predicts the scaling of the
   axial diffusivity, contrary to the conclusions of previous analyses.
   Second, for the extended de Gennes regime, we show that a modified blob
   theory, which has been used to incorporate the effect of local stiffness
   on DNA diffusion in nanoslits, explains the deviation from the
   prediction of classic blob theory for diffusion in nanochannels. Third,
   we provide a calculation similar to the modified blob theory to explain
   the relative insensitivity of the diffusivity to channel size for
   channels between the extended de Gennes regime and the Odijk regime,
   which is the most relevant regime for experiments and technological
   applications of DNA confinement in nanochannels. Our results not only
   are relevant to the dynamics of confined semiflexible polymers such as
   DNA but also reveal interesting analogies between confinement in
   channels and slits.}},

Title = {{Stochastic non-linear oscillator models of EEG: the Alzheimer's disease
   case}},
Journal = {{Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{In this article, the Electroencephalography (EEG) signal of the human
   brain is modeled as the output of stochastic non-linear coupled
   oscillator networks. It is shown that EEG signals recorded under
   different brain states in healthy as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   patients may be understood as distinct, statistically significant
   realizations of the model. EEG signals recorded during resting eyes-open
   (EO) and eyes-closed (EC) resting conditions in a pilot study with AD
   patients and age-matched healthy control subjects (CTL) are employed. An
   optimization scheme is then utilized to match the output of the
   stochastic Duffing-van der Pol double oscillator network with EEG
   signals recorded during each condition for AD and CTL subjects by
   selecting the model physical parameters and noise intensity. The
   selected signal characteristics are power spectral densities in major
   brain frequency bands Shannon and sample entropies. These measures allow
   matching of linear time varying frequency content as well as non-linear
   signal information content and complexity. The main finding of the work
   is that statistically significant unique models represent the EC and EO
   conditions for both CTL and AD subjects. However, it is also shown that
   the inclusion of sample entropy in the optimization process, to match
   the complexity of the EEG signal, enhances the stochastic non-linear
   oscillator model performance.}},

Abstract = {{Using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations we have explored the

   is motivated by observations that a high density of membrane-bound alpha
   Syn inhibits the fusion of synthetic small unilamellar vesicles. By
   combining three-dimensional pressure tensor calculations with our
   recently developed spherical harmonics fluctuation analysis approach, we
   show a reduction in membrane surface tension and increased membrane
   undulations when alpha Syn is bound to the vesicle's outer leaflet at a
   200: 1 L/P. The protein effects these changes by decreasing the negative
   pressure in the headgroup region of the outer leaflet and increasing the
   positive pressure throughout the hydrocarbon core.}},

Abstract = {{Of fundamental interest are multidisciplinary interactions encompassing:
   (1) first order systems such as those encountered in parabolic heat
   conduction, first order hyperbolic systems such as fluid flow, and so
   on, and (2) second order systems such as those encountered in hyperbolic
   heat conduction, hyperbolic second order systems such as elastodynamics
   and wave propagation, and so on. After space discretization using
   methods such as finite differences, finite volumes, finite elements, and
   the like, the consequent proper integration of the time continuous
   ordinary differential equations is extremely important. In particular,
   the physical quantities of interest may need to be mostly preserved
   and/or the equations should be optimally integrated so that there is
   minimal numerical dissipation, dispersion, algorithm overshoot, capture
   shocks without too much dissipation, solve stiff problems and enable the
   completion of the analysis, and so on. To-date, practical methods in
   most commercial and research software include the trapezoidal family
   (Euler forward/backward, Galerkin, and Crank Nicholson) for first order
   systems and the other counterpart trapezoidal family (Newmark family and
   variants with controllable numerical dissipation) for second order
   systems. For the respective first/second order systems, they are totally
   separate families of algorithms and are derived from altogether totally
   different numerical approximation techniques. Focusing on the class of
   the linear multistep (LMS) methods, algorithms by design was first
   utilized to develop GS4-2 framework for time integration of second order
   systems. We have also recently developed the GS4-1 framework for
   integrating first order systems. In contrast to all past efforts over
   the past 50 years or so, we present the formalism of a generalized
   unified framework, termed GS4 (generalized single step single solve),
   that unifies GS4-1 (first-order systems) and GS4-2 (second-order
   systems) frameworks for simultaneous use in both first and second order
   systems with optimal algorithms, numerical and order preserving
   attributes (in particular, second-order time accuracy) as well. The
   principal contribution emanating from such an integrated framework is
   the practicality and convenience of using the same computational
   framework and implementation when solving first and/or second order
   systems without having to resort to the individual framework. All that
   is needed is a single novel GS4-2 framework for either second-and/or
   first-order systems, and we show how to switch from one to the other for
   illustrative applications to thermo-mechanical problems influenced by
   first/second order systems, respectively. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley

Title = {{Mechanism of the increased rib cage expansion produced by the diaphragm

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{989-995}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{When the abdomen in quadriplegic subjects is given a passive mechanical
   support, the expansion of the lower rib cage during inspiration is
   greater and the inward displacement of the upper rib cage is smaller.
   These changes have traditionally been attributed to an increase in the
   appositional force of the diaphragm, but the mechanisms have not been
   assessed. In this study, the inspiratory intercostal muscles in all
   interspaces were severed in anesthetized dogs, so that the diaphragm was
   the only muscle active during inspiration, and the displacements of the
   ribs 10 and 5 and the changes in pleural and abdominal pressure were
   measured during unimpeded breathing and during breathing with a plate
   applied on the ventral abdominal wall. In addition, external forces were
   applied to the 10th rib pair in the cranial and lateral directions, and
   the rib trajectories thus obtained were used as the basis for a vector
   analysis to estimate the relative contributions of the insertional and
   appositional forces to the rib 10 displacements during breathing.
   Application of the abdominal plate caused a marked increase in the
   inspiratory cranial and outward displacement of rib 10 and a decrease in
   the inspiratory caudal displacement of rib 5. Analysis of the results
   showed, however, that 1) the insertional and appositional forces
   contributed nearly equally to the increased inspiratory displacement of
   rib 10 and 2) the decrease in the expiratory displacement of rib 5 was
   the result of both the greater displacement of the lower ribs and the
   decrease in pleural pressure.}},

Abstract = {{While beta oscillations often occur within the parkinsonian basal
   ganglia, how these oscillations emerge from a naive state and change
   with disease severity is not clear. To address this question, a
   progressive, nonhuman primate model of Parkinson's disease was developed
   using staged injections of MPTP. Within each parkinsonian state (naive,
   mild, moderate, and severe), spontaneous local field potentials were
   recorded throughout the sensorimotor globus pallidus. In the naive
   state, beta oscillations (11-32 Hz) occurred in half of the recordings,
   indicating spontaneous beta oscillations in globus pallidus are not
   pathognomonic. Mild and moderate states were characterized by a narrower
   distribution of beta frequencies that shifted toward the 8-15 Hz range.
   Additionally, coupling between the phase of beta and the amplitude of
   high-frequency oscillations (256-362 Hz) emerged in the mild state and
   increased with severity. These findings provide a novel mechanistic
   framework to understand how progressive loss of dopamine translates into
   abnormal information processing in the pallidum through alterations in
   oscillatory activity. The results suggest that rather than the emergence
   of oscillatory activity in one frequency spectrum or the other,
   parkinsonian motor signs may relate more to the development of altered
   coupling across multiple frequency spectrums.}},

Title = {{A spectral scheme for Kohn-Sham density functional theory of clusters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{287}},
Pages = {{226-253}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{Starting from the observation that one of the most successful methods
   for solving the Kohn-Sham equations for periodic systems - the
   plane-wave method - is a spectral method based on eigenfunction
   expansion, we formulate a spectral method designed towards solving the
   Kohn-Sham equations for clusters. This allows for efficient calculation
   of the electronic structure of clusters (and molecules) with high
   accuracy and systematic convergence properties without the need for any
   artificial periodicity. The basis functions in this method form a
   complete orthonormal set and are expressible in terms of spherical
   harmonics and spherical Bessel functions. Computation of the occupied
   eigenstates of the discretized Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian is carried out
   using a combination of preconditioned block eigensolvers and Chebyshev
   polynomial filter accelerated subspace iterations. Several algorithmic
   and computational aspects of the method, including computation of the
   electrostatics terms and parallelization are discussed. We have
   implemented these methods and algorithms into an efficient and reliable
   package called ClusterES (Cluster Electronic Structure). A variety of
   benchmark calculations employing local and non-local pseudopotentials
   are carried out using our package and the results are compared to the
   literature. Convergence properties of the basis set are discussed
   through numerical examples. Computations involving large systems that
   contain thousands of electrons are demonstrated to highlight the
   efficacy of our methodology. The use of our method to study clusters
   with arbitrary point group symmetries is briefly discussed. (C) 2015

   property of NINPs as ``colors{''} in the detection. In this paper, a
   detection scheme for magnetic nanoparticle size distribution is
   demonstrated by using an MNPs and search-coils integrated detection
   system. A low frequency (50 Hz) sinusoidal magnetic field is applied to
   drive MNPs into saturated region. Then a high frequency sinusoidal field
   sweeping from 5 kHz to 35 kHz is applied in order to generate mixing
   frequency signals, which are collected by a pair of balanced search
   coils. These harmonics are highly specific to the nonlinearity of
   magnetization curve of the MNPs. Previous work Focused on using the
   amplitude and phase of the 3rd harmonic or the amplitude ratio of the
   5th harmonic over 3rd harmonic. Here we demonstrate to use the amplitude
   and phase information of both 3rd and 5th harmonics as magnetic
   ``colors{''} of MNPs. It is found that this method effectively reduces
   the magnetic colorization error. Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Title = {{Self-Regulation of Cu/Sn Ratio in the Synthesis of Cu2ZnSnS4 Films}},

Abstract = {{There has been a tremendous recent surge of interest in copper zinc tin
   sulfide (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) as a photovoltaic material, because its
   optical and electronic properties are well-suited for solar cells, and
   its elemental constituents are abundant in the earths crust. Here we
   have studied the formation mechanisms of CZTS films, and the factors
   that control the cation stoichiometry during ex situ sulfidation of
   precursor Cu-Zn-Sn alloy films in a closed isothermal system. We find
   that the Cu/Sn ratio in CZTS is self-regulating and approaches 2,
   regardless of the initial composition of the precursor films, provided
   that adequate Sn is available in the sulfidation system. If precursor
   films are initially tin rich, excess Sn evaporates in the form of SnS.
   If precursor films are initially Sn-deficient, the inclusion of solid Sn
   in the sulfidation ampule readily generates SnS vapor, which mitigates
   the films Sn deficiency to return the Cu/Sn ratio to 2. When sulfidized
   for sufficiently long times at sufficiently high temperatures (e.g., 600
   degrees C, 8 h), films with similar Cu/Zn ratios exhibit similar phase
   compositions, such that if Cu/Zn >2, a Cu2SnS3 impurity phase is present
   in addition to CZTS, and if Cu/Zn < 2, a ZnS impurity phase occurs. To
   achieve phase-pure, void-free films, Sn-deficient precursor films with
   Cu/Zn in the desired range (typically close to, but slightly less than
   2) can be sulfidized with excess Sn in a closed system, or a system that
   maintains a SnS vapor pressure over the film. Time-dependent sulfidation
   experiments were performed to elucidate the mechanism of this Sn
   self-regulation. During the formation of CZTS, almost all of the Sn is
   found to leave the film as SnS, later reincorporation of the Sn
   occurring through reactions between SnS vapor and CuS to form Cu2SnS3.
   The ZnS and Cu2SnS3 phases within the films then interdiffuse to form
   CZTS. Because Cu/Sn is 2 in both Cu2SnS3 and CZTS, the Cu/Sn ratio tends
   to 2 when sufficient Sn is included in the system to consume all Cu.
   This strategy is useful for avoiding Cu-S minority phases, provided the
   films are sulfidized to the point of equilibrium phase composition.}},

Title = {{Response to Nodal morphogen gradient is determined by the kinetics of
   target gene induction}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 14}},
Abstract = {{Morphogen gradients expose cells to different signal concentrations and
   induce target genes with different ranges of expression. To determine
   how the Nodal morphogen gradient induces distinct gene expression
   patterns during zebrafish embryogenesis, we measured the activation
   dynamics of the signal transducer Smad2 and the expression kinetics of
   long- and short-range target genes. We found that threshold models based
   on ligand concentration are insufficient to predict the response of
   target genes. Instead, morphogen interpretation is shaped by the
   kinetics of target gene induction: the higher the rate of transcription
   and the earlier the onset of induction, the greater the spatial range of
   expression. Thus, the timing and magnitude of target gene expression can
   be used to modulate the range of expression and diversify the response
   to morphogen gradients.}},
