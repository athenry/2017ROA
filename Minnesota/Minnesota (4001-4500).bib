Abstract = {{This paper describes Trajectory-based Multi-Anycast forwarding (TMA),
   tailored and optimized for the efficient multicast data delivery in
   vehicular networks in terms of transmission cost. To our knowledge, this
   is the first attempt to investigate the efficient multicast data
   delivery in vehicle networks, based on the trajectories of vehicles in
   the multicast group. Due to the privacy concern, we assume only a
   central server knows the trajectory of each vehicle and the estimated
   current location of the vehicle. Therefore, after receiving a request of
   multicast data delivery from a source vehicle, the central server has to
   figure out how the data has to be delivered to the moving vehicles in
   the multicast group. For each target vehicle in the multicast group,
   multiple packet-and-vehicle rendezvous points are computed as a set of
   relay nodes to temporarily hold the data, considering the vehicle's
   trajectory. This set of rendezvous points can be considered an Anycast
   set for the target vehicle. We have formulated the multicast data
   delivery as the data delivery to the anycast sets of the multicast group
   vehicles. Through theoretical analysis and extensive simulation, it is
   shown that our design provides an efficient multicast for moving
   vehicles under a variety of vehicular traffic conditions. (C) 2013

Title = {{Correlations between Community Structure and Link Formation in Complex
   Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Links in complex networks commonly represent specific ties
   between pairs of nodes, such as protein-protein interactions in
   biological networks or friendships in social networks. However,
   understanding the mechanism of link formation in complex networks is a
   long standing challenge for network analysis and data mining.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: Links in complex networks have a
   tendency to cluster locally and form so-called communities. This widely
   existed phenomenon reflects some underlying mechanism of link formation.
   To study the correlations between community structure and link
   formation, we present a general computational framework including a
   theory for network partitioning and link probability estimation. Our
   approach enables us to accurately identify missing links in partially
   observed networks in an efficient way. The links having high connection
   likelihoods in the communities reveal that links are formed
   preferentially to create cliques and accordingly promote the clustering
   level of the communities. The experimental results verify that such a
   mechanism can be well captured by our approach.
   Conclusions/Significance: Our findings provide a new insight into
   understanding how links are created in the communities. The
   computational framework opens a wide range of possibilities to develop
   new approaches and applications, such as community detection and missing
   link prediction.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated whether air-drying beds reduce antibiotic
   resistance gene (ARC) concentrations in residual municipal wastewater
   solids. Three laboratory-scale drying beds were operated for a period of
   nearly 100 days. Real-time PCR was used to quantify 16S rRNA genes, 16S
   rRNA genes specific to fecal bacteria (AllBac) and human fecal bacteria
   (HF183), the integrase gene of class 1 integrons (intI1), and five ARGs
   representing a cross-section of antibiotic classes and resistance
   mechanisms (erm(B), sul1, tet(A), tet(W), and tet(X)). Air-drying beds
   were capable of reducing all gene target concentrations by 1 to 5 orders
   of magnitude, and the nature of this reduction was consistent with both

Abstract = {{There have been significant increases in stream flow in many rivers of
   the Upper Midwestern United States since 1980. Increased summer flows
   may negatively impact ecological processes, including aquatic organisms'
   life cycles. The smooth softshell (Apalone mutica) and wood turtle
   (Glyptemys insculpta) are threatened by alteration of stream flow regime
   and other changes to river ecosystems in the Upper Midwest. We
   hypothesized that prolonged duration of high summer flows would reduce
   time available for nesting. We assessed hydrologic change using the
   Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration program and stream gauge data,
   characterized physical properties of sandbars, surveyed turtle nesting
   sites and assessed historical channel change using aerial photos in GIS
   on five Upper Midwest rivers. A river stage-sandbar area relationship
   was developed to determine the effect of prolonged summer flow duration
   on turtle nesting opportunity for the 1940-2009 time period. Suitable
   water levels have declined since 1980 in the agricultural watersheds of
   southern Minnesota likely delaying hatching and reducing survival,
   particularly for aquatic turtles such as A. mutica. In contrast to the
   agricultural watersheds, there was no significant change in the northern
   forested rivers' stream flow and sandbar availability during the nesting
   season. Management to reduce summer stream flow in agricultural
   watersheds and protection of known nest sites could benefit threatened
   aquatic turtle populations.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic analysis of continuous fuel production by redox cycling
   of ceria in a single solar reactor under isothermal conditions is
   presented. Ceria is partially reduced in a sweep gas flow of purified
   nitrogen and reoxidized with either steam or carbon dioxide to produce
   hydrogen or carbon monoxide, respectively. The sweep gas and oxidizer
   flows are preheated by the product gases. The influence of selected
   process parameters, including operating temperature, pressure, and the
   effectiveness of heat recovery, on the solar-to-fuel conversion
   efficiency is determined. For a solar concentration ratio of 3000,
   typical of state-of-the-art solar dish concentrators, and operating
   temperature of 1773 K, 95.5\% of the available gas-phase heat must be
   recovered to reach conversion efficiencies of 10\% and 18\% for hydrogen
   and carbon monoxide production, respectively, assuming the flow rate of
   inert sweep gas is equivalent to that in a counter-current flow
   arrangement of gas and ceria. The efficiency depends strongly on the
   gas-phase heat recovery effectiveness and the sweep gas flow rate.
   Introducing a temperature swing of 150 K between reduction and oxidation
   steps strongly reduces the sweep gas flow rate and increases the
   efficiency from 10\% to 31.6\% for hydrogen production.}},

Abstract = {{The methylation of benzene, toluene, paraxylene, and ortho-xylene over
   MFI structured H-ZSM-5 and mesoporous self-pillared pentasil (H-SPP)
   with dimethyl ether (DME) at low conversions (<0.1\%) and high
   DME:aromatic ratios (>30:1) showed linear rate dependencies on aromatic
   pressure and zero dependence on DME pressure for benzene and toluene.
   These results are consistent with studies performed for olefin
   methylation, and are indicative of a zeolite surface covered in
   DME-derived species reacting with benzene or toluene in the
   rate-determining step. Saturation in the reaction rate was observed in
   xylene pressure dependence experiments (at 473 K, <5 kPa xylene);
   however, enhancement in the reaction rate was not observed when
   comparing similar to 1 mu m crystallite H-ZSM-5 and 2-7 nm mesopore
   H-SPP, indicating that xylene methylation proceeds in the absence of
   diffusion limitations. Simultaneous zero-order rate dependencies on
   xylene and DME pressures are described by a model based on adsorption of
   xylene onto a surface methylating species. This model is consistent with
   observed secondary kinetic isotope effects (k(H)/k(D) = 1.25-1.35) and
   extents of d(0), d(3), and d(6) DME formation in the effluent because of
   isotopic scrambling between unlabeled and d(6) DME when co-fed with
   aromatics over H-ZSM-5. Post-reaction titration of surface species with
   water after desorption of physisorbed intermediates showed a 1:1
   evolution of methanol to Al present in the catalyst, indicating the
   presence and involvement of surface methoxides during steady-state
   methylation of aromatics species.}},

Abstract = {{Background To experimentally determine the survival kinetics of
   influenza virus on personal protective equipment (PPE) and to evaluate
   the risk of virus transfer from PPE, it is important to compare the
   effects on virus recovery of the method used to contaminate the PPE with
   virus and the type of eluent used to recover it.
   Methods Avian influenza virus (AIV) was applied as a liquid suspension
   (spike test) and as an aerosol to three types of nonwoven fabrics
   {[}polypropylene (PP), polyester (PET), and polyamide (Nylon)] that are
   commonly used in the manufacture of PPE. This was followed by virus
   recovery using eight different eluents (phosphate-buffered saline,
   minimum essential medium, and 1.5\% or 3.0\% beef extract at pH 7, 8, or
   9).
   Results For spike tests, no statistically significant difference was
   found in virus recovery using any of the eluents tested. Hydrophobic
   surfaces (PP and PET) yielded higher spiked virus recovery than
   hydrophilic Nylon. From all materials, the virus recovery was much lower
   in aerosol challenge tests than in spike tests.
   Conclusions Significant differences were found in the recovery of viable
   AIV from non-woven fabrics between spike and aerosol challenge tests.
   The findings of this study demonstrate the need for realistic aerosol
   challenge tests rather than liquid spike tests in studies of virus
   survival on surfaces where airborne transmission of influenza virus may
   get involved.}},

Title = {{Long-term lateral deflection of precast, prestressed concrete spandrel
   beams}},
Journal = {{PCI JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{93-115}},
Month = {{FAL}},
Abstract = {{Slender precast concrete spandrels that span long distances are being
   used to increase the cost effectiveness of precast concrete parking
   structures. They are efficient because they reduce the number of column
   lines required in a building floor plan as well as the number of
   elements to transport and erect. However, increasing spandrel
   slenderness reduces sectional stiffness, making the spandrels prone to
   larger deflections. Moreover, because of the eccentric loading
   transferred from the deck double-tee beams, both vertical and lateral
   deflections should be considered in design. This paper provides
   realistic estimates of long-term deflections for slender spandrels and
   examines the parameters that affect these deflections. A numerical study
   was conducted using high-fidelity, nonlinear finite element analyses of
   L-shaped and pocket spandrels for different span lengths (48 and 60 ft
   {[}15 and 18 m]) and web thicknesses (8, 9, and 10 in. {[}200, 230, and
   250 mm]). The sensitivity of long-term deflections to parameters such as
   spandrel type, span length, beam width, concrete curing, creep,
   shrinkage, and load eccentricity and magnitude is presented. The results
   indicate that long-term lateral deflections are less than the
   corresponding long-term vertical deflections and in all cases long-term
   deflections were below a threshold of the lesser of length/500 and 1 in.

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Using a mapping between a Rouse dumbbell model and fine-grained Monte
   Carlo simulations, we have computed the relaxation time of lambda-DNA in
   a high ionic strength buffer confined in a nanochannel. The relaxation
   time thus obtained agrees quantitatively with experimental data
   {[}Reisner et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 196101 (2005)] using only a
   single O(1) fitting parameter to account for the uncertainty in model
   parameters. In addition to validating our mapping, this agreement
   supports our previous estimates of the friction coefficient of DNA
   confined in a nanochannel {[}Tree et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 228105
   (2012)], which have been difficult to validate due to the lack of direct
   experimental data. Furthermore, the model calculation shows that as the
   channel size passes below approximately 100 nm (or roughly the Kuhn
   length of DNA) there is a dramatic drop in the relaxation time. Inasmuch
   as the chain friction rises with decreasing channel size, the reduction
   in the relaxation time can be solely attributed to the sharp decline in
   the fluctuations of the chain extension. Practically, the low variance
   in the observed DNA extension in such small channels has important
   implications for genome mapping. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a set-theoretic method to capture the effect of
   parametric uncertainty in reliability and performability indices
   obtained from Markov reliability and reward models. We assume that model
   parameters, i.e., component failure and repair rates, are not perfectly
   known, except for upper and lower bounds obtained from engineering
   judgment or field data. Thus, the values that these parameters can take
   are constrained to lie within a set. In our method, we first construct a
   minimum volume ellipsoid that upper bounds this set, and hence contains
   all possible values that the parameters can take. This ellipsoid is then
   propagated via set operations through a second-order Taylor series
   expansion of the Markov chain stationary distribution, resulting in a
   set that provides approximate bounds on reliability and performability
   indices of interest. Case studies pertaining to a two-component shared
   load system with common-cause failures, and preventative maintenance of
   an electric-power distribution transformer, are presented.}},

Abstract = {{The size effect in the failure of a hybrid adhesive joint of a metal
   with a fiber-polymer composite, which has been experimentally
   demonstrated and analytically formulated in preceding two papers, is
   here investigated numerically. Cohesive finite elements with a
   mixed-mode fracture criterion are adopted to model the adhesive layer in
   the metal-composite interface. A linear traction-separation softening
   law is assumed to describe the damage evolution at debonding in the
   adhesive layer. The results of simulations agree with the previously
   measured load-displacement curves of geometrically similar hybrid joints
   of various sizes, with the size ratio of 1:4:12. The effective size of
   the fracture process zone is identified from the numerically simulated
   cohesive stress profile at the peak load. The fracture energy previously
   identified analytically by fitting the experimentally observed size
   effect curves agrees well with the fracture energy of the cohesive crack
   model obtained numerically by optimal fitting of the test data.}},

Abstract = {{The geometry of sedimentary strata records the dynamics of the surfaces
   that produced them. Cross strata are one of the most common features
   preserved in the stratigraphic record and are typically formed by
   migrating ripples, dunes, and bars. Cross-stratal geometry depends on
   the movement and shape of the bed forms. In this study, we provide
   theoretical relationships that map the statistics of surface kinematics
   and geometry of migrating bed forms into the 2-D geometrical structure
   of the preserved stratigraphy. The surface kinematics is characterized
   by the migration (translation of the waveforms) and deformation (change
   in shape of the waveforms) of the bed forms. We show that, for
   transverse, unidirectional bed forms, the local slope and curvature of
   the preserved stratigraphic boundaries depend on the competition between
   migration and deformation of the bed forms. Further, we show that
   deformation is the sole cause of curved cross-set boundaries and define
   a quantitative relationship between the curvature of the bounding
   surfaces of the preserved cross sets and the deformation rate of the bed
   forms. The theoretical results compare well with experimental data of
   subaqueous, transverse bed form evolution under equilibrium, steady
   state conditions with no net deposition.}},

Volume = {{118}},
Number = {{3}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Models for the overall topographic evolution of erosional and
   depositional systems can be grouped into two broad classes. The first
   class is local models in which the sediment flux at a point is expressed
   as a linear or nonlinear function of local hydrogeomorphic measures
   (e.g., water discharge and slope). The second class is nonlocal models,
   where the sediment flux at a point is expressed via a weighted average
   (i.e., convolution integral) of measures upstream and/or downstream of
   the point of interest. Until now, the nonlinear and nonlocal models have
   been developed independently. In this study, we develop a unified model
   for large-scale morphological evolution that combines both nonlinear and
   nonlocal approaches. With this model, we show that in a depositional
   system, under piston-style subsidence, the topographic signatures of
   nonlinearity and nonlocality are identical and that in combination,
   their influence is additive. Furthermore, unlike either nonlinear or
   nonlocal models alone, the combined model fits observed fluvial profiles
   with parameter values that are consistent with theory and independent
   observations. By contrast, under conditions of steady bypass, the
   nonlocal and nonlinear components in the combined model have distinctly
   different signatures. In the absence of nonlocality, a purely nonlinear
   model always predicts a bypass fluvial profile with a spatially constant
   slope, while a nonlocal model produces a nonconstant slope, i.e.,
   profile curvature. This result can be used as a test for inferring the
   presence of nonlocality and for untangling the relative roles of local
   and nonlocal mechanisms in shaping depositional morphology.}},

Abstract = {{Depositional patterns characteristic of river mouths are controlled by
   the sediment-laden turbulent jet exiting from rivers. Here we show that
   jet instability, developing at river mouths with small width-to-depth
   ratio, can affect these patterns. Numerical simulations indicate that
   sediment eddy diffusivity, which is a measure of the spreading of
   sediments out of the jet core, depends on the interplay between sediment
   settling and large coherent flow structures, which are associated with
   unstable jets. Our results suggest that optimal conditions for eddy
   diffusivity are met when the time scale of sediment settling is equal to
   the characteristic eddy time scale. In this condition, sediments are
   deposited at the farthest distance from the jet centerline, thus
   promoting the formation of lateral deposits. Settling time scales much
   greater or much smaller than the eddy time scale is associated with low
   eddy diffusivity, which promotes the formation of a central deposit.
   Such eddy-mediated sediment transport is more evident in the Zone Of
   Established Flow than in the Zone Of Flow Establishment, since the
   former is characterized by fully developed vortices. A simplified model
   is proposed to estimate the settling and eddy time scales and to predict
   the optimal condition for levee formation.}},

Title = {{Development of a Bimodal Ankle-Foot Prosthesis for Walking and
   Standing/Swaying}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The human ankle-foot system conforms to a circular effective rocker
   shape for walking, but to a much flatter effective shape for standing
   and swaying. Many persons with lower limb amputations have impaired
   balance and reduced balance confidence, and may benefit from prostheses
   designed to provide flatter effective rocker shapes during standing and
   swaying tasks. This paper describes the development and testing of an
   ankle-foot prosthesis prototype that provides distinctly different
   mechanical properties for walking and standing/swaying. The prototype
   developed was a single-axis prosthetic foot with a lockable ankle for
   added stability during standing and swaying. The bimodal ankle-foot
   prosthesis prototype was tested on pseudoprostheses (walking boots with
   prosthetic feet beneath) for walking and standing/swaying loads, and was
   compared to an Otto Bock single-axis prosthetic foot and to able-bodied
   data collected in a previous study. The height-normalized radius of the
   effective rocker shape for walking with the bimodal ankle-foot prototype
   was equal to that found earlier for able-bodied persons (0.17); the
   standing and swaying effective shape had a lower height-normalized
   radius (0.70) compared with that previously found for able-bodied
   persons (1.11). The bimodal ankle-foot prosthesis prototype had a
   similar radius as the Otto Bock single-axis prosthetic foot for the
   effective rocker shape for walking (0.17 for both), but had a much
   larger radius for standing and swaying (0.70 for bimodal, 0.34 for
   single-axis). The results suggest that the bimodal ankle-foot prosthesis
   prototype provides two distinct modes, including a biomimetic effective
   rocker shape for walking and an inherently stable base for standing and
   swaying. The radius of the prototype's effective rocker shape for
   standing/swaying suggests that it may provide inherent mechanical
   stability to a prosthesis user, since the radius is larger than the
   typical body center of mass's distance from the floor (between 50-60\%
   of height). Future testing is warranted to determine if the bimodal
   ankle-foot prosthesis will increase balance and balance confidence in
   prosthesis users.}},

Abstract = {{Triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) as a novel energy harvester has
   raised wide research interests recently, although the environmental
   effect on its performance is still lacking. This paper attempted to
   experimentally quantify the effect of the relative humidity (RH) as well
   as the pressure on the charge generated from a TENG. It was found that
   under the same mechanical excitation, the generated charge of the TENG
   increased more than 20\% when RH decreased from 90\% to 10\% at the
   ambient pressure. However, the generated charge decreased as the air
   pressure decreased from atmospheric pressure to 50 Torr at RH close to
   0\%, while the optimal pressure shifted to a lower level when the
   relative humidity was higher. This study can contribute not only to the
   design and packaging of triboelectric devices to operate in varying
   environments and extreme conditions, but also to the fundamental
   understanding of the mechanism of triboelectric effect. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We investigated small-scale hydraulic power actuation systems using a
   system level analysis, where small-scale refers to systems generating 10
   to 100 W output power, to determine whether the high power density
   advantage of hydraulics holds at small sizes. Hydraulic actuator system
   power density was analyzed with simple physics models and compared to an
   equivalent electromechanical system comprised of off-the-shelf
   components. Calculation results revealed that high operating pressures
   are needed for small-scale hydraulics to be lighter than the equivalent
   electromechanical system. The analysis was limited to the actuator and
   conduit as those are the components that must be located on the
   mechanism. A complete comparison should add the weight and efficiency of
   the power supply.}},

Abstract = {{Improved estimation of hydrometeorological states from down-sampled
   observations and background model forecasts in a noisy environment has
   been a subject of growing research in the past decades. Here we
   introduce a unified variational framework that ties together the
   problems of downscaling, data fusion, and data assimilation as ill-posed
   inverse problems. This framework seeks solutions beyond the classic
   least squares estimation paradigms by imposing a proper regularization,
   expressed as a constraint consistent with the degree of smoothness
   and/or probabilistic structure of the underlying state. We review
   relevant smoothing norm regularization methods in derivative space and
   extend classic formulations of the aforementioned problems with
   particular emphasis on land surface hydrometeorological applications.
   Our results demonstrate that proper regularization of downscaling, data
   fusion, and data assimilation problems can lead to more accurate and
   stable recovery of the underlying non-Gaussian state of interest with
   improved performance in capturing isolated and jump singularities. In
   particular, we show that the Huber regularization in the derivative
   space offers advantages, compared to the classic solution and the
   Tikhonov regularization, for spatial downscaling and fusion of
   non-Gaussian multisensor precipitation data. Furthermore, we explore the
   use of Huber regularization in a variational data assimilation
   experiment while the initial state of interest exhibits jump
   discontinuities and non-Gaussian probabilistic structure. To this end,
   we focus on the heat equation motivated by its fundamental application
   in the study of land surface heat and mass fluxes.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a systematic method for analyzing and designing the
   notches on the spool of a flow control valve to influence the
   area-schedule, i.e., relationship between the spool position and the
   metering area. The motivation for such a flow control valve comes from a
   novel hydraulic actuator intended for camless valve actuation in
   internal combustion engines. The proposed actuator has a unique
   hydromechanical internal feedback system in which the motion of the flow
   regulator's spool is directly coupled to the motion of the actuator.
   Lack of direct control of the spool position necessitates the
   appropriate modification of the spool design in order to control the
   variation of the effective area across the valve. The design
   modifications required to realize the desired area-schedules are first
   discussed. A systematic procedure which combines computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) analysis and geometry based analysis is then developed to
   characterize the variation of the effective area for various spool
   designs. It is shown that the mean area available for the fluid flow
   through the entire notch serves as a better approximation of the
   metering characteristics when compared to the traditional approach of
   using the minimum area. The proposed analysis procedure is validated
   with experimental data from a prototype spool valve. The fast turn
   around time of the proposed analysis technique is then used to develop
   an automated procedure to design the 3D features (notches) on the spool
   required to realize any specified area-schedule.}},

Abstract = {{A compact electrostatic nanoparticle sampler has been developed to
   support the offline analysis of nanoparticles via electron microscopy.
   The basic operational principle of the sampler is to electrically charge
   particles by mixing nanoparticles and unipolar ions produced by DC
   corona discharge, and electrostatically collecting charged particles. A
   parametric study was first performed to identify the optimal operating
   condition of the sampler: a total flow rate (i.e., the sum of the
   particle and ion carrier flow rates) of 1.0 lpm, an aerosol/ion carrier
   flow rate ratio of 1.0, and a collection voltage of 4.5 kV. Under the
   above condition, the sampler achieved a collection efficiency of more
   than 90 \% for particles ranging from 50 to 500 nm. The effect of
   particle material on the sampler's performance was also studied. The
   prototype had lower collection efficiencies for oleic acid particles
   than for sodium chloride particles in the size range from 50 to 150 nm,
   while achieving a comparable efficiency in the size range large than 150
   nm. Effects of particle diameter, particle material, and total flow rate
   on the sampler's collection efficiency are explained by the particle
   charging data, i.e., charging efficiencies and average charges per
   particle.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal power flow (OPF) is considered for microgrids, with the
   objective of minimizing either the power distribution losses, or, the
   cost of power drawn from the substation and supplied by distributed
   generation (DG) units, while effecting voltage regulation. The microgrid
   is unbalanced, due to unequal loads in each phase and non-equilateral
   conductor spacings on the distribution lines. Similar to OPF
   formulations for balanced systems, the considered OPF problem is
   nonconvex. Nevertheless, a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation
   technique is advocated to obtain a convex problem solvable in
   polynomial-time complexity. Enticingly, numerical tests demonstrate the
   ability of the proposed method to attain the globally optimal solution
   of the original nonconvex OPF. To ensure scalability with respect to the
   number of nodes, robustness to isolated communication outages, and data
   privacy and integrity, the proposed SDP is solved in a distributed
   fashion by resorting to the alternating direction method of multipliers.
   The resulting algorithm entails iterative message-passing among groups
   of consumers and guarantees faster convergence compared to competing
   alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of dividing a geographic region into subregions
   so as to minimize the maximum workload of a collection of facilities
   over that region. We assume that the cost of servicing a demand point is
   a monomial function of the distance to its assigned facility and that
   demand points follow a continuous probability density. We show that,
   when our objective is to minimize the maximum workload of all
   facilities, the optimal partition consists of a collection of circular
   arcs that are induced by a multiplicatively weighted Voronoi diagram.
   When we require that all subregions have equal area, the optimal
   partition consists of a collection of hyperbolic or quartic curves. We
   show that, for both problems, the dual variables correspond to
   ``prices{''} for a facility to serve a demand point, and our objective
   is to determine a set of prices such that the entire region is
   ``purchased{''} by the facilities, i.e., that the market clears. This
   allows us to solve the partitioning problem quickly without discretizing
   the service region.}},

Abstract = {{Squeezing light through nanometre-wide gaps in metals can lead to
   extreme field enhancements, nonlocal electromagnetic effects and
   light-induced electron tunnelling. This intriguing regime, however, has
   not been readily accessible to experimentalists because of the lack of
   reliable technology to fabricate uniform nanogaps with atomic-scale
   resolution and high throughput. Here we introduce a new patterning
   technology based on atomic layer deposition and simple
   adhesive-tape-based planarization. Using this method, we create
   vertically oriented gaps in opaque metal films along the entire contour
   of a millimetre-sized pattern, with gap widths as narrow as 9.9
   angstrom, and pack 150,000 such devices on a 4-inch wafer.
   Electromagnetic waves pass exclusively through the nanogaps, enabling
   background-free transmission measurements. We observe resonant
   transmission of near-infrared waves through 1.1-nm-wide gaps
   (lambda/1,295) and measure an effective refractive index of 17.8. We
   also observe resonant transmission of millimetre waves through
   1.1-nm-wide gaps (lambda/4,000,000) and infer an unprecedented field

Abstract = {{A self-iterating soft equalizer (SISE) consisting of a few relatively
   weak constituent equalizers is shown to provide robust performance even
   in severe intersymbol interference (ISI) channels that exhibit deep
   nulls and valleys within the signal band. Constituent equalizers are
   allowed to exchange soft information in the absence of interleavers
   based on the method that are designed to handle significant correlation
   among their soft outputs. The resulting SISE works well as a stand-alone
   equalizer or as the equalizer component of a turbo equalization system.
   The performance advantages over existing methods are validated with
   bit-error-rate (BER) simulations and extrinsic information transfer
   (EXIT) chart analysis. It is shown that in turbo equalizer setting the
   SISE achieves performance closer to the maximum a posteriori probability
   equalizer than any other known schemes in very severe ISI channels.}},

Title = {{Toward a neurometric foundation for probabilistic independent component

Journal = {{COGNITIVE AFFECTIVE \& BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{641-659}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Improved fMRI data analysis methods hold promise for breakthroughs in
   cognitive and affective neuroscience. Group probabilistic independent
   component analysis (pICA), such as that implemented by MELODIC (Beckmann
   \& Smith IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging 23:137-152, 2004), is one
   popular technique that typifies this development. Recently pICA has been
   proposed to be a reliable method for studying connectivity networks (Zuo
   et al. NeuroImage 49:2163-2177, 2010); however, there is no
   ``standard{''} way to complete a pICA, and the full impact of the
   options on neurometric properties of resulting components is unknown. In
   the present study, we sought to assess the robustness, reproducibility,
   and within-subject test-retest reliability of ICA in two data sets: The
   first included 30 subjects imaged 3 weeks apart while completing a
   cognitive control task, and the second included 27 subjects imaged 9
   months apart during rest. In addition to examining the impact of
   analytic parameters on the neurometrics, this study was the first to
   simultaneously investigate within-subject reliability of ICA-derived
   components from rest and task fMRI data. Results suggested that for both
   task and rest, meta-level analyses using 25 subject orders optimized
   robustness of the components. The impact of dimensionality and voxel
   threshold for components was subsequently examined regarding properties
   of reproducibility and within-subject retest reliability. Component
   thresholds between 0.2 and 0.6 of the maximum value optimized
   reproducibility across multiple dimensionalities and produced generally
   fair to moderate reliability estimates (Cicchetti \& Sparrow American
   Journal of Mental Deficiency 86:127-137, 1981). These guidelines
   strengthen the foundation for this data-driven approach to fMRI analysis
   by providing prescriptive findings and a descriptive set of neurometrics
   for resting-state and task fMRI.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to develop pipelined fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) architectures for real-valued signals. The proposed
   methodology is based on modifying the flow graph of the FFT algorithm
   such that it has both real and complex datapaths. The imaginary parts of
   the computations replace the redundant operations in the modified flow
   graph. New butterfly structures are designed to handle the hybrid
   datapaths. The proposed hybrid datapath leads to a general approach
   which can be extended to all radix-2(n) based FFT algorithms. Further,
   architectures with arbitrary level of parallelism can be derived using
   the folding methodology. Novel 2-parallel and 4-parallel architectures
   are presented for radix-2(3) and radix-2(4) algorithms. The proposed
   architectures maximize the utilization of hardware components with no
   redundant computations. The proposed radix-2(3) and radix-2(4)
   architectures lead to low hardware complexity with respect to adders and
   delays. The N-point 4-parallel radix-2(4) architecture requires
   2(log(16) N - 1) complex multipliers, 2log(2)N real adders and N complex

Abstract = {{Folding transformation enables synthesis of digital signal processing
   algorithms described by iterative data flow graphs (DFGs). For a
   specified feasible folding set, it returns a synthesized hardware
   architecture described by a hardware DFG. This brief presents
   hierarchical folding and hierarchical synthesis of iterative DFGs that
   contain many identical or similar substructures. Instead of performing
   folding or synthesis on the entire large DFG, the hierarchical folding
   transformation performs folding or synthesis only on one substructure
   and then completes the folding process by appropriately changing the
   number of delays and switch instances in this folded structure. The
   advantage lies in significant reduction in execution time. Two different
   approaches to hierarchical folding presented include hierarchical
   interleaved folding and hierarchical contiguous folding. Experimental
   results show that the run time increase of the synthesis process for a
   20-cascaded fifth-order wave digital filter can be reduced from 2000\%
   to 30\% using hierarchical synthesis instead of conventional synthesis,
   compared with the run time for synthesis of one section.}},

Volume = {{99}},

Abstract = {{This study establishes a dual-time computational platform for solving
   the nonlinear parabolic wave equation in situations when the prescribed
   ultrasound excitation is modulated by a ``low{''}-frequency envelope.
   The key advantage of the dual-time approach lies in the fact that the
   nonlinear solution is approximated, for an arbitrary modulation
   envelope, using a set of precomputed steady-state solutions. This makes
   the method computationally inexpensive, and allows for the fast
   simulation of long excitation signals for which the time-domain
   simulations are inherently fruitless. To study the applicability of the
   dual-time method a sample problem, which models the axisymmetric
   nonlinear wave propagation in soft tissues, is solved using both the
   dual-time approach and its conventional time-domain counterpart. The
   results demonstrate that the accuracy of the proposed approximation is
   proportional to the ratio between the (dominant) modulation frequency
   omega(m) and carrier ultrasound frequency omega(u), as suggested by
   theoretical predictions. In particular, it is found that the solution
   error is on the order of few percent when omega(m)/omega(u) = 1/20, and
   decreases thereon with diminishing omega(m). The effectiveness of the
   dual-time simulations in terms of both memory and computational cost
   makes them particularly advantageous for more demanding problems, such
   as those entailing three-dimensional propagation of modulated nonlinear
   sound fields. One immediate application of the proposed computational
   platform resides in the simulation of high-intensity ultrasound fields
   in soft tissues, that are increasingly used for diagnostic purposes via
   applications of thus generated acoustic radiation force.}},

   severely degrade in applications requiring high frequency and small

   paper, we present a new type of device based on optical micromachined
   ultrasound transducer (OMUT) technology. OMUTs rely on microfabrication
   techniques to construct micrometer-scale air cavities capped by an
   elastic membrane. A modified photoresist bonding process has been
   developed to facilitate the fabrication of these devices. We will
   describe the design, fabrication, and testing of prototype OMUT devices
   which implement a receive-only function. Future design modifications are

Abstract = {{A Brownian Dynamics (BD) method to calculate the steady state charge
   distribution on spherical and non-spherical aerosol particles is
   presented which circumvents ion-particle collision rate calculation. BD
   calculations are performed using both monodisperse and measured
   polydisperse ion properties under atmospheric pressure, room temperature
   conditions. Calculations reveal that for spherical particles in both the
   nano- and submicrometer size ranges, the fractions of charged particles
   are noticeably under-predicted by flux matching theory-based regression
   expressions. In the examination of non-spherical particles (aggregates,
   linear chains and cylinders), two models for accumulated particle charge
   are employed: (1) accumulated charge distributes itself along a particle
   surface, and (2) accumulated charge is immobile. Independent of model,
   it is found that particles having a Projected Area (PA) to diffusion
   based surface area (pi R-s(2)) ratio close to unity behaves similar to a
   sphere of the same mobility diameter. However, model specific behavior
   is observed for highly non-spherical particles (PA/pi R-s(2) < 0.5).
   With distributed charge, highly non-spherical particles acquire more
   charges than an equivalent mobility sphere in the sub 100 nm range, yet
   acquire less charge than spheres in the submicrometer range. Conversely,
   with immobile charges, non-spherical particles are found to be more
   charged than equivalent mobility diameter spheres in both the nano- and
   submicrometer size ranges. The results of BD calculations are used to
   develop accurate regression expressions for the charge distribution on
   spherical and non-spherical particles considering three situations:
   conducting particles (where both Coulomb and image potentials are
   accounted for), non-conducting particles where charge is distributed,
   and non-conducting particles where charge is immobilized. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Profiling phylogenetic marker genes, such as the 16S rRNA gene, is a key
   tool for studies of microbial communities but does not provide direct
   evidence of a community's functional capabilities. Here we describe
   PICRUSt (phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of
   unobserved states), a computational approach to predict the functional
   composition of a metagenome using marker gene data and a database of
   reference genomes. PICRUSt uses an extended ancestral-state
   reconstruction algorithm to predict which gene families are present and
   then combines gene families to estimate the composite metagenome. Using
   16S information, PICRUSt recaptures key findings from the Human
   Microbiome Project and accurately predicts the abundance of gene
   families in host-associated and environmental communities, with
   quantifiable uncertainty. Our results demonstrate that phylogeny and
   function are sufficiently linked that this `predictive metagenomic'
   approach should provide useful insights into the thousands of
   uncultivated microbial communities for which only marker gene surveys
   are currently available.}},

Abstract = {{Objective:The goal of this study was to develop, implement, and test an
   automated decision system to provide early detection of clinically
   important bronchopulmonary events in a population of lung transplant
   recipients following a home monitoring protocol. Subjects and Methods:
   Spirometry and other clinical data were collected daily at home by lung
   transplant recipients and transmitted weekly to the study data center.
   Decision rules were developed using wavelet analysis of declines in
   spirometry and increases in respiratory symptoms from a learning set of
   patient home data and validated with an independent patient
   set.Results:Using forced expiratory volume in 1s or symptoms, the
   detection captured the majority of events (sensitivity, 80-90\%) at an
   acceptable level of false alarms. On average, detections occurred
   6.6-10.8 days earlier than the known event records. Conclusions:This
   approach is useful for early discovery of pulmonary events and has the
   potential to decrease the time required for humans to review large
   amount of home monitoring data to discover relatively infrequent but
   clinically important events.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) systems and
   natural gas combined cycle (NGCC) systems are employed to provide heat
   and electricity to a 0.19 hm(3) y(-1) (50 million gallon per year) corn
   ethanol plant using different fuels (syrup and corn stover, corn stover

   are performed to study effects of different fuels, gas turbine
   compression pressure, dryers (steam tube or superheated steam) for
   biomass fuels and ethanol co-products, and steam tube dryer exhaust
   treatment methods. The goal is to maximize electricity generation while
   meeting process heat needs of the plant. At fuel input rates of 110 MW,
   BIGCC systems with steam tube dryers provide 20-25 MW of power to the
   grid with system thermal efficiencies (net power generated plus process
   heat rate divided by fuel input rate) of 69-74\%. NGCC systems with
   steam tube dryers provide 26-30 MW of power to the grid with system
   thermal efficiencies of 74-78\%. BIGCC systems with superheated steam
   dryers provide 20-22 MW of power to the grid with system thermal
   efficiencies of 53-56\%. The life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emission
   reduction for conventional corn ethanol compared to gasoline is 39\% for
   process heat with natural gas (grid electricity), 117\% for BIGCC with
   syrup and corn stover fuel, 124\% for BIGCC with corn stover fuel, and
   93\% for NGCC with natural gas fuel. These GHG emission estimates do not

Abstract = {{LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposons are mobile genetic elements comprising
   similar to 17\% of the human genome. New L1 insertions can profoundly
   alter gene function and cause disease, though their significance in
   cancer remains unclear. Here, we applied enhanced retrotransposon
   capture sequencing (RC-seq) to 19 hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) genomes
   and elucidated two archetypal L1-mediated mechanisms enabling
   tumorigenesis. In the first example, 4/19 (21.1\%) donors presented
   germline retrotransposition events in the tumor suppressor mutated in
   colorectal cancers (MCC). MCC expression was ablated in each case,
   enabling oncogenic beta-catenin/Wnt signaling. In the second example,
   suppression of tumorigenicity 18 (ST18) was activated by a
   tumor-specific L1 insertion. Experimental assays confirmed that the L1
   interrupted a negative feedback loop by blocking ST18 repression of its
   enhancer. ST18 was also frequently amplified in HCC nodules from
   Mdr2(-/-) mice, supporting its assignment as a candidate liver oncogene.
   These proof-of-principle results substantiate L1-mediated
   retrotransposition as an important etiological factor in HCC. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This paper considers transmit optimization in multi-input multi-output
   (MIMO) wiretap channels, wherein we aim at maximizing the secrecy
   capacity or rate of an MIMO channel overheard by one or multiple
   eavesdroppers. Such optimization problems are nonconvex, and appear to
   be difficult especially in the multi-eavesdropper scenario. In this
   paper, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) approach to tackle
   these secrecy optimization problems. We first consider the secrecy
   capacity maximization (SCM) problem in the single eavesdropper scenario.
   An AO algorithm is derived through a judicious SCM reformulation. The
   algorithm conducts some kind of reweighting and water-filling in an
   alternating fashion, and thus is computationally efficient to implement.
   We also prove that the AO algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of the SCM problem. Then, we turn our
   attention to the multiple eavesdropper scenario, where the artificial
   noise (AN)-aided secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem is considered.
   Although the AN-aided SRM problem has a more complex problem structure
   than the previous SCM, we show that AO can be extended to deal with the
   former, wherein the problem is handled by solving convex problems in an
   alternating fashion. Again, the resulting AO method is proven to have
   KKT point convergence guarantee. For fast implementation, a
   custom-designed AO algorithm based on smoothing and projected gradient
   is also derived. The secrecy rate performance and computational
   efficiency of the proposed algorithms are demonstrated by simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Although the North American power grid has been recognized as the most
   important engineering achievement of the 20th century, the modern power
   grid faces major challenges {[}87]. Increasingly complex
   interconnections even at the continent size render prevention of the
   rare yet catastrophic cascade failures a strenuous concern.
   Environmental incentives require carefully revisiting how electrical
   power is generated, transmitted, and consumed, with particular emphasis
   on the integration of renewable energy resources. Pervasive use of
   digital technology in grid operation demands resiliency against physical
   and cyberattacks on the power infrastructure. Enhancing grid efficiency
   without compromising stability and quality in the face of deregulation
   is imperative. Soliciting consumer participation and exploring new
   business opportunities facilitated by the intelligent grid
   infrastructure hold a great economic potential.
   The smart grid vision aspires to address such challenges by capitalizing
   on state-of-the-art information technologies in sensing, control,
   communication, and machine learning {[}2], {[}24]. The resultant grid is
   envisioned to have an unprecedented level of situational awareness and
   controllability over its services and infrastructure to provide fast and
   accurate diagnosis/prognosis, operation resiliency upon contingencies
   and malicious attacks, as well as seamless integration of distributed
   energy resources.}},

Abstract = {{We design sparse and block sparse feedback gains that minimize the
   variance amplification (i.e., the H-2 norm) of distributed systems. Our
   approach consists of two steps. First, we identify sparsity patterns of
   feedback gains by incorporating sparsity-promoting penalty functions
   into the optimal control problem, where the added terms penalize the
   number of communication links in the distributed controller. Second, we
   optimize feedback gains subject to structural constraints determined by
   the identified sparsity patterns. In the first step, the sparsity
   structure of feedback gains is identified using the alternating
   direction method of multipliers, which is a powerful algorithm
   well-suited to large optimization problems. This method alternates
   between promoting the sparsity of the controller and optimizing the
   closed-loop performance, which allows us to exploit the structure of the
   corresponding objective functions. In particular, we take advantage of
   the separability of the sparsity-promoting penalty functions to
   decompose the minimization problem into sub-problems that can be solved
   analytically. Several examples are provided to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the developed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable oil-based shape-memory polyurethane networks are an emerging
   class of bio-based functional materials with great potential

   polyurethanes (SOPUs) were characterized with differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), dynamic mechanical tests (DMA), tensile testing,
   shape-memory testing, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). It was found
   that SOPUs with a preserved triglyceride structure were fixed in a
   temporary shape at -20 A degrees C, while others were fixed in temporary
   shapes at 4 A degrees C. Although the recovery speeds were different,
   all the samples could completely regain their permanent shapes at 37 A
   degrees C (human body temperature). Furthermore, different SOPUs
   exhibited different surface structures, which might provide the
   materials with additional values.}},

Journal = {{NATURE GENETICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{977+}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Thousands of somatic mutations accrue in most human cancers, and their
   causes are largely unknown. We recently showed that the DNA cytidine
   deaminase APOBEC3B accounts for up to half of the mutational load in
   breast carcinomas expressing this enzyme. Here we address whether
   APOBEC3B is broadly responsible for mutagenesis in multiple tumor types.
   We analyzed gene expression data and mutation patterns, distributions
   and loads for 19 different cancer types, with over 4,800 exomes and
   1,000,000 somatic mutations. Notably, APOBEC3B is upregulated, and its
   preferred target sequence is frequently mutated and clustered in at
   least six distinct cancers: bladder, cervix, lung (adenocarcinoma and
   squamous cell carcinoma), head and neck, and breast. Interpreting these
   findings in the light of previous genetic, cellular and biochemical
   studies, the most parsimonious conclusion from these global analyses is
   that APOBEC3B-catalyzed genomic uracil lesions are responsible for a
   large proportion of both dispersed and clustered mutations in multiple
   distinct cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Most economic models assume that individuals act out their preferences
   based on self-interest alone. However, there have also been other
   paradigms in economics that aim to capture aspects of behavior that
   include fairness, reciprocity, and altruism. In this study we
   empirically examine preferences of travel time and income distributions
   with and without the respondent knowing their own position in each
   distribution. The data comes from a Stated Preference experiment where
   subjects were presented paired alternative distributions of travel time
   and income. The alternatives require a tradeoff between distributional
   concerns and the respondent's own position. Choices also do not penalize
   or reward any particular choice. Overall, choices show individuals are
   willing forgo alternatives where they would be individually well off in
   the interest of distributional concerns in both the travel time and
   income cases. Exclusively self-interested choices are seen more in the
   income questions, where nearly 25 \% of respondents express such
   preferences, than in the travel time case, where only 5 \% of
   respondents make such choices. The results also suggest that respondents
   prioritize their own position differently relative to regional
   distributions of travel time and income. Estimated choice models show
   that when it comes to travel time, individuals are more concerned with
   societal average travel time followed by the standard deviation in the
   region and finally their own travel time, while in the case of income
   they are more concerned with their own income, followed by a desire for
   more variability, and finally increasing the minimum income in their
   region. When individuals do not know their fate after a policy change
   that affects regional travel time, their choices appear to be mainly
   motivated by risk averse behavior and aim to reduce variability in
   outcomes. On the other hand, in the income context, the expected value
   appears to drive choices. In all cases, population-wide tastes are also
   estimated and reported.}},

Abstract = {{Thermopower waves convert chemical energy into electrical power using
   nanostructured thermal conduits like carbon nanotubes (CNTs) by taking
   advantage of their high thermal conductivity to propagate the heat
   released by an exothermic reaction of a fuel layer coated around the
   conduit. Electron-phonon coupling in the CNTs then leads to an
   electrical output. Previous work using cyclotrimethylene-trinitramine
   coated around multiwalled CNTs has shown electrical output as high as 7
   kW kg(-1). This phenomenon has potential to aid the manufacture of
   nanoscale power sources capable of releasing large power pulses for
   specific applications. Researchers have studied the effects of other
   system properties, including the conduit thermal conductivity, the
   chemical properties of the fuel, and the coupling of the reactions to
   inorganic thermoelectric materials. An analytical solution for the
   governing heat and mass balance equations has also been derived. Here,

Abstract = {{It is demonstrated that processing flow affects the kinetics of the

   as a function of Sigma (interfacial copolymer density) fell on the same
   master curve, unifying reaction process, temperature and time. G(c) was
   a linear function of Sigma for low-copolymer coverage and weak adhesion.
   For relatively high coverage and strong adhesion, G(c) scaled with
   Sigma(2). Coextrusion with compressive flow resulted in a reaction rate
   strikingly two-orders of magnitude faster than that without compressive
   flow. The rate in the noncompressive die was close to quiescent
   lamination. Even for lamination, when compressive flow was applied
   normal to the interface, the coupling reaction rate was also greatly
   accelerated. Several mechanisms are speculated for this remarkable
   acceleration in polymer chain coupling. (c) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Highly crystalline exfoliated MFI-nanosheets can pave the way for
   large-scale deployment of sub-500-nm zeolite membranes due to their
   processing and packing advantages. Exfoliated MFI-nanosheets prepared by
   melt compounding contain a large amount of polymer and unexfoliated
   particles which are detrimental to the fabrication of ultrathin zeolite
   membranes. Complete removal of polystyrene from the nanosheet suspension
   in toluene is demonstrated by centrifugation of the suspension across
   chlorobenzene as confirmed by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) data and
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. Rate-zonal centrifugation
   in a nonlinear density gradient fractionated exfoliated MFI-nanosheets
   from unexfoliated particles. The purified nanosheets were highly
   crystalline as indicated by high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) and electron
   diffraction (ED). Coating of purified MFI-nanosheets on a smooth
   -alumina support, fabricated by filtration of -alumina suspension, led
   to a compact, b-oriented, 80-nm-thick film. A mild hydrothermal
   treatment of the film led to a 200-nm-thick membrane, which demonstrated
   molecular sieving properties. (c) 2013 American Institute of Chemical

Abstract = {{The conversion of branched-chain amino acids to branched-chain acids or
   alcohols is an important aspect of flavor in the food industry and is
   dependent on the Ehrlich pathway found in certain lactic acid bacteria.
   A key enzyme in the pathway, the 2-keto acid decarboxylase (KDC), is
   also of interest in biotechnology applications to produce small
   branched-chain alcohols that might serve as improved biofuels or other
   commodity feedstocks. This enzyme has been extensively studied in the
   model bacterium Lactococcus lactis, but is also found in other bacteria
   and higher organisms. In this report, distinct homologs of the L.lactis
   KDC originally annotated as pyruvate decarboxylases from Psychrobacter
   cryohalolentis K5 and P.arcticus 273-4 were cloned and characterized,
   confirming a related activity toward specific branched-chain 2-keto
   acids derived from branched-chain amino acids. Further, KDC activity was
   confirmed in intact cells and cell-free extracts of P.cryohalolentis K5
   grown on both rich and defined media, indicating that the Ehrlich
   pathway may also be utilized in some psychrotrophs and psychrophiles. A
   comparison of the similarities and differences in the P.cryohalolentis
   K5 and P.arcticus 273-4 KDC activities to other bacterial KDCs is

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{792-801}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Heat transfer in air-cooled heat sinks must be improved to meet thermal
   management requirements of modern microelectronics devices. This need is
   addressed by putting agitator plates into channels of a heat sink so
   that heat transfer is enhanced by agitation. A proof-of-concept exercise
   was computationally conducted in a single channel consisting of
   uniform-temperature base and two side walls and an adiabatic fourth
   wall. The channel side walls are fins of the heat sink fin array. The
   agitator plate is within the channel. Air flows through the channel and
   the agitator plate generates periodic motion in a transverse direction
   to the air flow and to the channel surface. Turbulence is generated
   along the tip of the agitator plate due to its periodical motion,
   resulting in substantial heat transfer enhancement in the channel. Heat
   transfer is enhanced by 61\% by agitation for a representative
   situation. Translational operation of the plate induces 33\% more heat
   transfer than a corresponding flapping operation. Heat transfer on the
   base surface increases sharply as the tip gap size between it and the
   agitator plate tip is decreased, while heat transfer on the sidewalls is
   insensitive to the tip gap size. Heat transfer from the channel wall to
   the flow increases linearly with increases of amplitude or frequency of
   the agitator plate. The primary operational parameter to the problem is
   the product of amplitude and frequency, with amplitude being slightly
   more influential than frequency. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Renewable portfolio standards (RPS) differ widely across US states.
   Prior research findings on the effectiveness of these policies to
   stimulate renewable electricity deployment are equally wide ranging.
   This study investigates patterns of RPS policy design and analyzes the
   effects on policy outcomes measured at the level of utility compliance.
   Measuring organizational outcomes of RPS corrects for the first time the
   challenges of prior research focused on state-level renewable capacity
   or generation outcomes. The quantitative analysis also takes into
   account the complexity of RPS design, by making use of a state-by-state
   database of RPS design characteristics developed for this study.
   Patterns of RPS design across states are compared, including the
   compliance schedule, scope, eligibility of resources, quotas and
   subsidies, renewable energy credit provisions, as well as enforcement
   and penalties. Together, the map of state RPS design and the new
   approach to RPS outcome analysis illuminate the diversity of RPS policy
   practice across the United States. They suggest the need to both account
   for the variety of design characteristics and accurately specify the
   policy outcomes in evaluations of these policies.}},

Abstract = {{In developing implantable tissues based on cellular remodeling of a
   fibrin scaffold, a key indicator of success is high collagen content.
   Cellular collagen synthesis is stimulated by cyclic stretching but is
   limited by cellular adaptation. Adaptation is mediated by deactivation
   of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK); therefore inhibition of
   ERK deactivation should improve mechanically stimulated collagen
   production and accelerate the development of strong engineered tissues.
   The hypothesis of this study is that p38 mitogen activated protein
   kinase (p38) activation by stretching limits ERK activation and that
   chemical inhibition of p38 alpha/gamma isoforms with SB203580 will
   increase stretching-induced ERK activation and collagen production. Both
   p38 and ERK were activated by 15 min of stretching but only p38 remained
   active after 1 h. After an effective dose of inhibitor was identified
   using cell monolayers, 5 mu M SB203580 was found to increase ERK
   activation by two-fold in cyclically stretched fibrin-based tissue
   constructs. When 5 mu M SB203580 was added to the culture medium of
   constructs exposed to 3 weeks of incremental amplitude cyclic stretch,
   2.6 fold higher stretching-induced total collagen was obtained. In
   conclusion, SB203580 circumvents adaptation to stretching induced
   collagen production and may be useful in engineering tissues where
   mechanical strength is a priority.}},

Abstract = {{The theoretical lower limit of subthreshold swing in MOSFETs (60
   mV/decade) significantly restricts low-voltage operation since it
   results in a low ON-to-OFF current ratio at low supply voltages. This
   paper investigates extremely low-power circuits based on new Si/SiGe
   heterojunction tunneling transistors (HETTs) that have a subthreshold
   swing of <60 mV/decade. Device characteristics, as determined through
   technology computer aided design tools, are used to develop a Verilog-A
   device model to simulate and evaluate a range of HETT-based circuits. We
   show that an HETT-based ring oscillator (RO) shows a 9-19 times
   reduction in dynamic power compared to a CMOS RO. We also explore two
   key differences between HETTs and traditional MOSFETs, namely,
   asymmetric current flow and increased Miller capacitance, analyze their
   effect on circuit behavior, and propose methods to address them. HETT
   characteristics have the most dramatic impact on static random access
   memory (SRAM) operation and we propose a novel seven-transistor
   HETT-based SRAM cell topology to overcome, and take advantage of, the
   asymmetric current flow. This new HETT SRAM design achieves 7-37 times
   reduction in leakage power compared to CMOS.}},

Abstract = {{Tool-rock interaction processes can be classified as indentation or
   cutting depending on the direction of motion of the tool with respect to
   the rock surface. The modes of failure induced in the rock by an
   indenting or a cutting tool can be ductile and/or brittle. The ductile
   mode is associated with the development of a damage zone, whereas the
   brittle mode involves the growth of macrocracks. This is the first part
   of a series of two papers concerned with an analysis of the cutting and
   the indentation processes based on using the discrete element method. In
   this paper, numerical simulations of the cutting process are conducted
   to reproduce the transition from a ductile to a brittle failure mode
   with increasing depth of cut, which is observed in experiments. The
   numerical results provide evidence that the critical depth of cut d({*})
   controlling the failure mode transition is related to the characteristic
   length =(K-Ic/sigma(c))(2) with K-Ic denoting the material toughness and
   sigma(c) its unconfined compressive strength. The nature of frictional
   contact between the cutter face and the rock in the ductile failure mode
   is also examined. It is shown that the inclination of the total cutting
   force is controlled by a multi-directional flow mechanism ahead of the
   cutter that is related to the formation of a wedge of failed material,
   intermittently adhering to the cutter. As a result, the inclination of
   the total cutting force varies with the rake angle of the cutter and
   cannot be considered an intrinsic measure of the interfacial friction
   between the cutter and the rock. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The failure mechanisms induced by a wedge-shaped tool indenting normally
   against a rock surface are investigated using the discrete element
   method (DEM). The main focus of this study is to explore the conditions
   controlling the transition from a ductile to a brittle mode of failure.
   The development of a damage zone and the initiation and propagation of a
   brittle fracture is well captured by the DEM simulations. The numerical
   results support the conjecture that initiation of brittle fractures is
   governed by a scaled flaw length, a ratio between the flaw size lambda
   and the characteristic length l = (K-Ic/sigma(c))(2) (where K-Ic is the
   toughness and sigma(c) the uniaxial compressive strength). The size of
   the damage zone agrees well with analytical predictions based on the
   cavity expansion model. The effects of a far-field confining stress and
   the existence of a relief surface near the indenter are also examined.

Abstract = {{Thermal gradients were measured through the section of the I-35W St.
   Anthony Falls Bridge, a posttensioned concrete box girder bridge in
   Minneapolis, Minnesota, over the course of 3 years. The magnitudes and
   shapes of the measured thermal gradients were compared with various
   design gradients, and a fifth-order curve was found to best approximate
   the shape of the gradients. The responses of the structure to the
   largest measured thermal gradients were compared with stresses and
   deformations predicted by finite-element modeling given applied design
   gradients. The measured structural response was found to be best
   predicted when the finite-element model of the bridge was subjected to a
   fifth-order design thermal gradient scaled to match maximum top surface
   temperature values proposed by AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specifications
   for the region. Stresses and deformations predicted by finite-element
   modeling using the AASHTO LRFD bilinear design gradients were found to
   be considerably lower than those derived from measured results.

Abstract = {{Under extreme earthquake loading, light-frame wood building collapse is
   often caused by excessive interstory drifts at one or more story levels,
   leading to catastrophic failure once the shear walls, and subsequently
   the entire structure, become unstable. This soft-story collapse
   mechanism has been observed in numerous earthquakes. Current
   performance-based seismic design methods for light-frame wood buildings
   typically uses very conservative drift levels to represent the near
   collapse deformation of wood frame building systems, such as the 3\%
   drift limit used in ACSE Standard 41 corresponding to a collapse
   prevention performance target. A series of full-scale collapse loading
   tests on wood shear walls was conducted in this study to identify the
   ultimate drift level at which collapse will occur and is described in
   this paper. It was concluded that laterally braced wood shear walls can
   remain stable up to interstory drift, depending on the magnitude of the
   vertical loading. If one considers the typical design range of gravity
   load commonly seen in multistory light-frame wood construction,
   assigning a single ultimate drift level of 7\% for light-frame wood
   building collapse limits appears to be justifiable based on the
   experimental results presented herein.}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Vertical hydrokinetic turbines in an array that extends from one side of
   a channel or river to the other side of it experience a fixed blockage
   effect as a result of the adjacent turbines and a variable free-surface
   effect due to water level changes above turbines. For tidal
   applications, the water level above turbine blades changes continuously
   throughout the day; for river applications, the water level changes on a
   seasonal basis. In this study, a vertical turbine operating in an array
   of turbines with one diameter lateral distance between two adjacent
   turbines is modeled. The model turbine is tested in a water tunnel at
   various water levels. Results show that the water level reduction
   improves the power coefficient of the turbine when the turbine is fully
   submerged the power coefficient increases due to the free-surface
   effect, with trends in agreement with the one-dimensional actuator-disc
   flow theory. However, the power coefficient decreases significantly when
   the turbine is only partially submerged. In this particular condition,
   the entrained air into the water by turbine blades separates the water
   from the blade surface. A high-speed camera visualizes the flow
   separation while a transducer measures the instantaneous torque of the
   turbine. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Brown rot fungi are theorized to use both free radicals and enzymes to
   degrade wood. If these incompatible agents are employed in sequence
   (enzymatic after oxidative) in order to avoid interaction, this should
   be resolvable spatially in rotting wood. To assess this, we used thin
   spruce wafers as substrates, with the largest face the transverse plane.
   Propped wafers were colonized from the bottom (tangential to grain) by
   Postia placenta, using wood cell orientation and gravity to slow fungal
   egress and accentuate spatial gradients. After brief colonization,
   wafers were cut into 1-mm strips progressing up the wafer, and
   subsectioned for complementary analyses. Analyses included fungal
   growth, pH, cellulase activity, and wood modifications attributable to
   non-enzymatic mechanisms. Hyphae were imaged using confocal microscopy
   of fluorophore-tagged chitin. Dilute alkali solubility and lignin
   demethylation were measured as proxies (consequences) of carbohydrate
   depolymerization and lignin oxidation, respectively. Because P. placenta
   lacks genes for cellobiohydrolases, endoglucanase (EG) activity was
   measured. In composites of reassembled sections, hyphal fronts and
   apparent depolymerization preceded EG and lignin demethylation fronts by
   more than 6 mm. Although detection limits are a caveat when implicating
   novel fungal metabolites, results encourage and provide methodology for
   targeting this interesting leading edge of cellulolysis. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Percussive drilling is extensively used to drill hard rocks in the earth
   resource industry, where it performs best compared to other drilling
   technologies. In this paper, we propose a novel model of the process
   that consists of a drifting oscillator under impulsive loading coupled
   with a bilinear force/penetration interface law, together with a kinetic
   energy threshold for continuous bit penetration. Following the
   formulation of the model, we analyze its steady-state response and show
   that there exists a parallel between theoretical and experimental
   predictions, as both exhibit a maximum of the average penetration rate
   with respect to the vertical load on bit. In addition, the existence of
   complex long-term dynamics with the coexistence of periodic solutions in
   certain parameter ranges is demonstrated. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Covariance matrices have found success in several computer vision
   applications, including activity recognition, visual surveillance, and
   diffusion tensor imaging. This is because they provide an easy platform
   for fusing multiple features compactly. An important task in all of
   these applications is to compare two covariance matrices using a
   (dis)similarity function, for which the common choice is the Riemannian
   metric on the manifold inhabited by these matrices. As this Riemannian
   manifold is not flat, the dissimilarities should take into account the
   curvature of the manifold. As a result, such distance computations tend
   to slow down, especially when the matrix dimensions are large or
   gradients are required. Further, suitability of the metric to enable
   efficient nearest neighbor retrieval is an important requirement in the
   contemporary times of big data analytics. To alleviate these
   difficulties, this paper proposes a novel dissimilarity measure for
   covariances, the Jensen-Bregman LogDet Divergence (JBLD). This
   divergence enjoys several desirable theoretical properties and at the
   same time is computationally less demanding (compared to standard
   measures). Utilizing the fact that the square root of JBLD is a metric,
   we address the problem of efficient nearest neighbor retrieval on large
   covariance datasets via a metric tree data structure. To this end, we
   propose a K-Means clustering algorithm on JBLD. We demonstrate the
   superior performance of JBLD on covariance datasets from several
   computer vision applications.}},

Abstract = {{Variable block size motion estimation (VBSME) is becoming the new coding
   technique in H.264/AVC. This article presents a low-power VLSI
   implementation for VBSME, which employs a fast full-search
   block-matching algorithm to reduce power consumption, while preserving
   the optimal motion vectors (MVs). The fast full-search algorithm is
   based on the comparison of the current minimum sum of absolute
   difference (SAD) to a conservative lower bound so that unnecessary SAD
   calculations can be eliminated. We first experimentally determine the
   specific conservative lower bound of SAD and then implement the fast
   full-search algorithm in FPGA and 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. To the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first time that a fast full-search
   block-matching algorithm is explored to reduce power consumption in the
   context of VBSME and implemented in hardware. Experiment results show
   that the proposed design can save power consumption by 45\% compared to
   conventional VBSME designs that give optimal MV based on the full-search
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial spin ice(1) is a class of lithographically created arrays of
   interacting ferromagnetic nanometre-scale islands. It was introduced to
   investigate many-body phenomena related to frustration and disorder in a
   material that could be tailored to precise specifications and imaged
   directly. Because of the large magnetic energy scales of these nanoscale
   islands, it has so far been impossible to thermally anneal artificial
   spin ice into desired thermodynamic ensembles; nearly all studies of
   artificial spin ice have either treated it as a granular material
   activated by alternating fields(2) or focused on the as-grown state of
   the arrays(3). This limitation has prevented experimental investigation
   of novel phases that can emerge from the nominal ground states of
   frustrated lattices. For example, artificial kagome spin ice, in which
   the islands are arranged on the edges of a hexagonal net, is predicted
   to support states with monopolar charge order at entropies below that of
   the previously observed pseudo-ice manifold(4). Here we demonstrate a
   method for thermalizing artificial spin ices with square and kagome
   lattices by heating above the Curie temperature of the constituent
   material. In this manner, artificial square spin ice achieves
   unprecedented thermal ordering of the moments. In artificial kagome spin
   ice, we observe incipient crystallization of the magnetic charges
   embedded in pseudo-ice, with crystallites of magnetic charges whose size
   can be controlled by tuning the lattice constant. We find excellent
   agreement between experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations of
   emergent charge-charge interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Probability reigns in biology, with random molecular events dictating
   the fate of individual organisms, and propelling populations of species
   through evolution. In principle, the master probability equation
   provides the most complete model of probabilistic behavior in
   biomolecular networks. In practice, master equations describing complex
   reaction networks have remained unsolved for over 70 years. This
   practical challenge is a reason why master equations, for all their
   potential, have not inspired biological discovery. Herein, we present a
   closure scheme that solves the master probability equation of networks
   of chemical or biochemical reactions. We cast the master equation in
   terms of ordinary differential equations that describe the time
   evolution of probability distribution moments. We postulate that a
   finite number of moments capture all of the necessary information, and
   compute the probability distribution and higher-order moments by
   maximizing the information entropy of the system. An accurate order
   closure is selected, and the dynamic evolution of molecular populations
   is simulated. Comparison with kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, which
   merely sample the probability distribution, demonstrates this closure
   scheme is accurate for several small reaction networks. The importance
   of this result notwithstanding, a most striking finding is that the
   steady state of stochastic reaction networks can now be readily computed
   in a single-step calculation, without the need to simulate the evolution
   of the probability distribution in time.}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy has become an essential tool for
   treating a range of brain disorders. In the resting state, DBS is known
   to regularize spike activity in and downstream of the stimulated brain
   target, which in turn has been hypothesized to create informational
   lesions. Here, we specifically test this hypothesis using repetitive
   joint articulations in two non-human Primates while recording
   single-unit activity in the sensorimotor globus pallidus and motor
   thalamus before, during, and after DBS in the globus pallidus (GP)
   GP-DBS resulted in: (1) stimulus-entrained firing patterns in globus
   pallidus, (2) a monophasic stimulus-entrained firing pattern in motor
   thalamus, and (3) a complete or partial loss of responsiveness to joint
   position, velocity, or acceleration in globus pallidus (75\%, 12/16
   cells) and in the pallidal receiving area of motor thalamus (ventralis
   lateralis pars oralis, VLo) (38\%, 21/55 cells). Despite loss of
   kinematic tuning, cells in the globus pallidus (63\%, 10/16 cells) and
   VLo (84\%, 46/55 cells) still responded to one or more aspects of joint
   movement during GP-DBS. Further, modulated kinematic tuning did not
   always necessitate modulation in firing patterns (2/12 cells in globus
   pallidus; 13/23 cells in VLo), and regularized firing patterns did not
   always correspond to altered responses to joint articulation (3/4 cells
   in globus pallidus, 11/33 cells in VLo). In this context, DBS therapy
   appears to function as an amalgam of network modulating and network
   lesioning therapies.}},

Title = {{PEGylation of gold-decorated silica nanoparticles in the aerosol phase}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{33}},
Month = {{AUG 23}},
Abstract = {{Coating of gold-decorated silica nanoparticles with polyethylene glycol
   (PEG) was carried out in the aerosol phase. The process involves first
   functionalizing the nanoparticles at similar to 225 degrees C with a
   bifunctional reactant, 2-mercaptoethanol (ME), for which one end is a
   thiol that attaches to the gold surface and the other end is a terminal
   hydroxyl group, and then introducing ethylene oxide (EO), which reacts
   at similar to 440 degrees C with the hydroxyl group via a ring-opening
   polymerization to grow PEG. The morphology, elemental composition and
   surface chemistry of the PEGylated nanoparticles were characterized by
   means of transmission electron microscopy, energy dispersive x-ray
   spectroscopy in scanning transmission electron microscopy, x-ray
   photoelectron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
   The increase in mobility diameter of the nanoparticles due to PEG growth
   was measured on-line by tandem differential mobility analysis. The PEG
   coating thickness was found to increase with increases in gold
   decoration density, flow rate of ME, and flow rate of EO. Coating
   thicknesses up to similar to 4.5 nm were measured on nanoparticles whose
   initial mobility diameter equaled 39 nm.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this investigation is to demonstrate, by means of numerical
   simulation, that the Coanda effect can be used to affect the trajectory
   of fine fibers created by the melt-blown process. The Coanda effect
   serves to modulate the direction of fluid motion, and, in turn, the
   change in the pattern of fluid flow alters the fiber trajectories.
   Primary focus is accorded to the use of plane walls to induce the Coanda
   effect, but some consideration is given to curved Coanda-inducing walls
   for comparison purposes. The lateral standoff distance between the
   location of the fiber exit from the die and the Coanda-inducing wall was
   varied parametrically. The range of standoff distances for which the
   presence of a plane wall induced the Coanda effect was determined.
   Another outcome of general significance is that the Coanda effects
   induced by a curved wall and a plane wall are of comparable magnitude.}},

Title = {{Environmental Consequences of Invasive Species: Greenhouse Gas Emissions
   of Insecticide Use and the Role of Biological Control in Reducing
   Emissions}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Greenhouse gas emissions associated with pesticide applications against
   invasive species constitute an environmental cost of species invasions
   that has remained largely unrecognized. Here we calculate greenhouse gas
   emissions associated with the invasion of an agricultural pest from Asia
   to North America. The soybean aphid, Aphis glycines, was first
   discovered in North America in 2000, and has led to a substantial
   increase in insecticide use in soybeans. We estimate that the
   manufacture, transport, and application of insecticides against soybean
   aphid results in approximately 10.6 kg of carbon dioxide (CO2)
   equivalent greenhouse gasses being emitted per hectare of soybeans
   treated. Given the acreage sprayed, this has led to annual emissions of
   between 6 and 40 million kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gasses in the
   United States since the invasion of soybean aphid, depending on pest
   population size. Emissions would be higher were it not for the
   development of a threshold aphid density below which farmers are advised
   not to spray. Without a threshold, farmers tend to spray preemptively
   and the threshold allows farmers to take advantage of naturally
   occurring biological control of the soybean aphid, which can be
   substantial. We find that adoption of the soybean aphid economic
   threshold can lead to emission reductions of approximately 300 million
   kg of CO2 equivalent greenhouse gases per year in the United States.
   Previous studies have documented that biological control agents such as
   lady beetles are capable of suppressing aphid densities below this
   threshold in over half of the soybean acreage in the U.S. Given the
   acreages involved this suggests that biological control results in
   annual emission reductions of over 200 million kg of CO2 equivalents.
   These analyses show how interactions between invasive species and
   organisms that suppress them can interact to affect greenhouse gas
   emissions.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{7769-7776}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{We combine in situ Bragg diffraction, laser diffraction, high speed
   fluorescence scanning, and large-scale data processing to arrive at
   statistically significant conclusions about the role of order during the
   microchip electrophoresis separation of short DNA molecules (86 base
   pairs and 709 base pairs) in colloidal crystals. This experimental
   approach directly connects the presence of long-range order (obtained by
   laser diffraction) to the DNA transport (obtained by fluorescence
   detection) in hundreds of ``mini-columns{''} composed of 500 mu m-long
   regions of the devices. To within statistical significance, the
   electrophoretic mobility is the same in regions of the chip with
   long-range order and those with short-range order, independent of the
   electric field and molecular weight. Moreover, the relative mobilities
   of the DNA agree well with a recent estimate for the Ogston sieving
   mobility in a colloidal crystal. Similar to previous work, the band
   broadening during the transit through the colloidal crystal is
   negligible. These features imply that colloidal crystals for DNA
   separation in the Ogston sieving regime do not require exquisite control
   over the microstructure to maximize the separation resolution,
   simplifying their assembly for routine use.}},

Abstract = {{Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble

   properties (adsorption isotherms, selectivities, and Henry's law
   constants) and structural properties (density and orientational

   to a reduction of these properties. The solute density profiles show
   oscillatory behavior along the surface normal, and peaks in the number
   density are correlated with a preference for parallel orientations. The
   CBMC-GE approach allows for the efficient calculation of these selective

Volume = {{247}},

Abstract = {{In this work we outline a Classical Trajectory Calculation Direct
   Simulation Monte Carlo (CTC-DSMC) implementation that uses the
   no-time-counter scheme with a cross-section determined by the
   interatomic potential energy surface (PES). CTC-DSMC solutions for
   translational and rotational relaxation in one-dimensional shock waves
   are compared directly to pure Molecular Dynamics simulations employing
   an identical PES, where exact agreement is demonstrated for all cases.
   For the flows considered, long-lived collisions occur within the
   simulations and their implications for multi-body collisions as well as
   algorithm implications for the CTC-DSMC method are discussed. A
   parallelization technique for CTC-DSMC simulations using a heterogeneous
   multicore CPU/GPU system is demonstrated. Our approach shows good
   scaling as long as a sufficiently large number of collisions are
   calculated simultaneously per GPU (similar to 100,000) at each DSMC
   iteration. We achieve a maximum speedup of 140x on a 4 GPU/CPU system
   vs. the performance on one CPU core in serial for a diatomic nitrogen
   shock. The parallelization approach presented here significantly reduces
   the cost of CTC-DSMC simulations and has the potential to scale to large
   CPU/GPU clusters, which could enable future application to 3D flows in
   strong thermochemical nonequilibrium. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   Cryoelectron micrograph analyses and 3D reconstructions showed that the
   virus retains its overall icosahedral structure at this mildly acidic
   pH, except in the membrane-binding region, where monomeric E1 associates
   with the target membrane and the E2 glycoprotein retains its original

Abstract = {{At low mole fractions, cholesterol segregates into 10- to
   100-nm-diameter nanodomains dispersed throughout primarily
   dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) domains in mixed DPPC:cholesterol
   monolayers. The nanodomains consist of 6:1 DPPC:cholesterol
   ``complexes{''} that decorate and lengthen DPPC domain boundaries,
   consistent with a reduced line tension, lambda. The surface viscosity of
   the monolayer, eta(s), decreases exponentially with the area fraction of
   the nanodomains at fixed surface pressure over the 0.1- to 10-Hz range
   of frequencies common to respiration. At fixed cholesterol fraction, the
   surface viscosity increases exponentially with surface pressure in
   similar ways for all cholesterol fractions. This increase can be
   explained with a free-area model that relates eta(s) to the pure DPPC
   monolayer compressibility and collapse pressure. The elastic modulus,
   G', initially decreases with cholesterol fraction, consistent with the
   decrease in lambda expected from the line-active nanodomains, in analogy
   to 3D emulsions. However, increasing cholesterol further causes a sharp
   increase in G' between 4 and 5 mol\% cholesterol owing to an evolution
   in the domain morphology, so that the monolayer is elastic rather than
   viscous over 0.1-10 Hz. Understanding the effects of small mole
   fractions of cholesterol should help resolve the controversial role
   cholesterol plays in human lung surfactants and may give clues as to how
   cholesterol influences raft formation in cell membranes.}},

   Nd1-xCaxCoO3-delta and comparisons to Pr1-xCaxCoO3-delta}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},

Abstract = {{Low bandwidth Pr-based cobalt perovskites, such as Pr1-xCaxCoO3-delta,
   have received significant recent attention as they undergo first-order
   spin-state transitions with a strong influence on magnetic and transport
   properties. The unique nature of the Pr-O bond has been implicated as
   the impetus for these transitions, as it is thought that
   temperature-dependent charge transfer can occur between Pr and Co ions,
   i.e., a partial Pr3+-> Pr4+ and Co4+-> Co3+ valence shift. In the
   present work, we have studied the related compound Nd1-xCaxCoO3-delta.
   The Nd3+ ions have very similar ionic radius to Pr3+ but do not induce a
   temperature-dependent valence shift (at least in the composition range
   studied here), enabling deconvolution of the intrinsic low bandwidth
   physics from the unique effects of Pr-Obonding in Pr1-xCaxCoO3-delta. To
   this end, we have characterized the structural, magnetic, and electronic
   transport characteristics of Nd1-xCaxCoO3-delta bulk polycrystals, using
   neutron diffraction, small-angle neutron scattering, dc and ac
   magnetometry, and magnetotransport, and have established the
   Nd1-xCaxCoO3-delta magnetic phase diagram. This phase diagram contains
   regimes of short-range ferromagnetism and long-range ferromagnetism, in
   addition to ferrimagnetism. We argue that, with the exception of the
   valence transition that occurs at high x (e. g., x = 0.5) in
   Pr1-xCaxCoO3-delta and the low-temperature ordering of Nd3+ moments that
   results in the ferrimagnetism in Nd1-xCaxCoO3-delta, the two systems are
   nearly isostructural and have similar magnetic and transport properties.
   The low bandwidth physics intrinsic to both systems is summarized as
   encompassing long-range ferromagnetism with a relatively low Curie
   temperature due to Co-O-Co bond buckling (<60 K for Nd1-xCaxCoO3-delta),
   short-range ferromagnetism that emerges at much higher temperatures
   (similar to 270 K for Nd1-xCaxCoO3-delta), and likely stems from oxygen
   deficiency, exchange-spring behavior related to magnetoelectronic phase
   separation, and a doping-driven insulator-metal transition. In addition
   to elucidating the essential physics of narrow bandwidth perovskite
   cobaltites, the results thus further confirm the importance of the
   unique features of the Pr-O bond in driving the abrupt spin-state
   transition in Pr1-xCaxCoO3-delta.}},

Title = {{Depth-dependent temperature effects on thermoluminescence in multilayers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that thermal gradients penetrating deep into a material
   can preserve a memory of the temperature history of the surface. To
   date, this concept has been largely applied in the earth sciences, but
   there are many applications where a memory of rapid thermal events would
   be useful. For example, multiple layers of thermoluminescent films could
   serve as temperature sensors that indicate temperature versus depth in a
   microfabricated structure. As an advance toward this goal, this paper
   examines the effect of nonuniform temperature profiles on the
   thermoluminescence of heterogeneous multilayers. A Nd:YAG laser is used
   to create a known thermal event and apply pulses of heat energy of
   varying duration to a metalized thermoluminescent multilayer composed of
   LiF:Mg, Ti and CaF2:Dy. The thermoluminescence of the system is measured
   before and after the applied laser pulse. To model the process, a
   finite-difference time-domain method is used to calculate the dynamic
   heat transfer, and the temperature distribution is plugged into a first
   order kinetics model of the thermoluminescence of each film to get a
   final luminescent intensity. A thermal contact conductance between the
   critical layers is also introduced. Dynamic temperatures in durations of
   hundreds of milliseconds are resolved with the technique, and simulation
   curves match experimental measurements to within 6\% at 250 ms. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The mechanical stiffness of a cell's environment exerts a strong, but
   variable, influence on cell behavior and fate. For example, different
   cell types cultured on compliant substrates have opposite trends of cell
   migration and traction as a function of substrate stiffness. Here, we
   describe how a motor-clutch model of cell traction, which exhibits a
   maximum in traction force with respect to substrate stiffness, may
   provide a mechanistic basis for understanding how cells are tuned to
   sense the stiffness of specific microenvironments. We find that the
   optimal stiffness is generally more sensitive to clutch parameters than
   to motor parameters, but that single parameter changes are generally
   only effective over a small range of values. By contrast, dual parameter
   changes, such as coordinately increasing the numbers of both motors and
   clutches offer a larger dynamic range for tuning the optimum. The model
   exhibits distinct regimes: at high substrate stiffness, clutches quickly
   build force and fail (so-called frictional slippage), whereas at low
   substrate stiffness, clutches fail spontaneously before the motors can
   load the substrate appreciably (a second regime of frictional slippage).
   Between the two extremes, we find the maximum traction force, which
   occurs when the substrate load-and-fail cycle time equals the expected
   time for all clutches to bind. At this stiffness, clutches are used to
   their fullest extent, and motors are therefore resisted to their fullest
   extent. The analysis suggests that coordinate parameter shifts, such as
   increasing the numbers of motors and clutches, could underlie tumor
   progression and collective cell migration.}},

Abstract = {{Aqueous reduction of graphene oxide is a low energy and
   hazardous-chemical free method to produce graphene. In this article, we
   report the first polymer nanocomposites with aqueous reduced graphene
   (ARG). Dispersion of ARG in polymer can be challenging because of the
   aggregation and stacking of single sheets during the removal of water. A
   novel co-solvent process to blend ARG into thermoplastic polyurethane
   (TPU) avoids drying ARG by adding an organic solvent before water is
   completely removed from the aqueous reduction mixture. The dispersion of
   ARC in TPU was significantly improved using the co-solvent process
   compared to conventional solvent blending as demonstrated by the
   mechanical and electrical properties of ARG/TPU composites. Moreover,
   properties of the co-solvent blended ARC composite are similar to those
   of the composites of thermally reduced graphene (TRG), which are the
   best reported to date. We believe that using solvent exchange to avoid
   aggregation during drying is a general strategy applicable to other
   nanocomposite preparations. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   significant amplitude, in this paper, we proposed a method based on
   correlation index and the feature of power distribution to automatically
   detect eye blink components. Furthermore, we prove mathematically that
   the correlation between independent components and scalp EEG channels
   can be translating directly from the mixing matrix of ICA. This helps to
   simplify calculations and understand the implications of the
   correlation. The proposed method doesn't need to select a template or
   thresholds in advance, and it works without simultaneously recording an
   electrooculography (EOG) reference. The experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed method can automatically recognize eye blink
   components with a high accuracy on entire datasets from 15 subjects.}},

Abstract = {{The optical performance of a novel solar concentrator consisting of a
   400 spherical heliostat array and a linked two-axis tracking system is
   analyzed using the Monte Carlo ray-tracing technique. The optical

   decreases with the increasing number of heliostats in the individual
   groups due to increasing optical inaccuracies. In June, the
   best-performing linked configuration, in which 1 heliostat in the
   east-west direction and 2 heliostats in the north-south direction are
   linked, provides a monthly-averaged 7-hour optical efficiency and

   maximum fluid temperature based on solar concentration ratio, pressure
   loss, and compressor/turbine efficiencies are then varied to examine
   their effect on cycle efficiency. C6-fluoroketone, cyclohexane,
   n-pentane, R-141b, R-245fa, and HFE-7000 are examined as working fluids
   in the bottoming segment of the combined cycle. A single Brayton cycle
   is found to reach a peak cycle efficiency of 15.31\% with carbon dioxide
   at design point conditions. Each Brayton cycle fluid is examined as a
   topping cycle fluid in the combined cycle, being paired with six
   potential bottoming fluids, resulting in 36 working fluid

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},

Volume = {{28}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Background: Neck pain afflicts 30-50\% of the U.S. population annually;
   however we currently have poor diagnostic differentiation techniques to
   inform individualized treatment. Planar neck kinematics has been shown
   to be correlated with neck pain, but neck motion is much more complex
   than pure planar activities. Our objective was to define a methodology
   for determining aberrant neck kinematics and assess it.
   Methods: We examined a complex neck kinematic activity of neck
   circumduction and computed the pathway of motion using the instantaneous
   helical axis approach in 81 patients with non-specific neck pain and in
   20 non-matched symptom free subjects. Neck circumduction, or rolling of
   the head, represents a complex neck kinematic activity, investigating
   the innate coupled motion of the cervical spine at the end ranges of
   motion in all directions. Instance of discontinuities in the helical
   axis patterns, or folds, were identified and labeled as occurrences of
   aberrant motion.
   Findings: The instances of aberrant motion, or folds, which are nearly
   non-existent in the healthy sample group, are present in both the pre-
   and post-treatment neck pain patients. Following a treatment
   intervention of the symptomatic patients, pain and neck disability index
   decreased significantly (P < 0.001) concomitant with a decrease in the
   number of folds (P = 0.021).
   Interpretation: The present study highlights a new technique using an
   instantaneous helical axis approach to detect subtle abnormalities in
   the pathway of motion of the head about the trunk, during a neck
   circumduction exercise. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   element}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{729}},
Pages = {{524-562}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulation (DNS) is used to study laminar to turbulent
   transition induced by a discrete hemispherical roughness element in a
   high-speed laminar boundary layer. The simulations are performed under
   conditions matching the experiments of Danehy et al. (AIAA Paper
   2009-394, 2009) for free-stream Mach numbers of 3.37, 5.26 and 8.23. It
   is observed that the Mach 8.23 flow remains laminar downstream of the
   roughness, while the lower Mach numbers undergo transition. The Mach
   3.37 flow undergoes transition closer to the bump when compared with
   Mach 5.26, in agreement with experimental observations. Transition is
   accompanied by an increase in C-f and C-h (Stanton number). Even for the
   case that did not undergo transition (Mach 8.23), streamwise vortices
   induced by the roughness cause a significant rise in C-f until 20D
   downstream. The mean van Driest transformed velocity and Reynolds stress
   for Mach 3.37 and 5.26 show good agreement with available data. Temporal
   spectra of pressure for Mach 3.37 show that frequencies in the range of
   10-1000 kHz are dominant. The transition process involves the following
   key elements: upon interaction with the roughness element, the boundary
   layer separates to form a series of spanwise vortices upstream of the
   roughness and a separation shear layer. The system of spanwise vortices
   wrap around the roughness element in the form of horseshoe/necklace
   vortices to yield a system of counter-rotating streamwise vortices
   downstream of the element. These vortices are located beneath the
   separation shear layer and perturb it, which results in the formation of
   trains of hairpin-shaped vortices further downstream of the roughness
   for the cases that undergo transition. These hairpins spread in the span
   with increasing downstream distance and the flow increasingly resembles
   a fully developed turbulent boundary layer. A local Reynolds number
   based on the wall properties is seen to correlate with the onset of
   transition for the cases considered.}},

Abstract = {{Low-temperature cracking (LTC) is a major distress and cause of failure
   for asphalt pavements located in regions with cold climate; however,
   most pavement design methods do not directly address LTC. The thermal
   cracking model (TCModel) utilised by American Association of State
   Highway and Transportation Officials Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement
   Design Guide relies heavily on phenomenological Paris law for crack
   propagation. The TCModel predictions are primarily based on tensile
   strength of asphalt mixture and do not account for quasi-brittle
   behaviour of asphalt concrete. Furthermore, TCModel utilises a
   simplified one-dimensional viscoelastic solution for the determination
   of thermally induced stresses. This article describes a newly developed
   comprehensive software system for LTC prediction in asphalt pavements.
   The software system called IlliTC' utilises a user-friendly graphical
   interface with a stand-alone finite-element-based simulation programme.
   The system includes a preanalyser and data input generator module that
   develops a two-dimensional finite element (FE) pavement model for the
   user and which identifies critical events for thermal cracking using an
   efficient viscoelastic pavement stress simulation algorithm. Cooling
   events that are identified as critical are rigorously simulated using a
   viscoelastic FE analysis engine coupled with a fracture-energy-based
   cohesive zone fracture model. This article presents a comprehensive
   summary of the components of the IlliTC system. Model verifications,
   field calibration and preliminary validation results are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{DNA methylation is a chromatin modification that is frequently
   associated with epigenetic regulation in plants and mammals. However,
   genetic changes such as transposon insertions can also lead to changes
   in DNA methylation. Genome-wide profiles of DNA methylation for 20 maize
   (Zea mays) inbred lines were used to discover differentially methylated
   regions (DMRs). The methylation level for each of these DMRs was also
   assayed in 31 additional maize or teosinte genotypes, resulting in the
   discovery of 1966 common DMRs and 1754 rare DMRs. Analysis of
   recombinant inbred lines provides evidence that the majority of DMRs are
   heritable. A local association scan found that nearly half of the DMRs
   with common variation are significantly associated with single
   nucleotide polymorphisms found within or near the DMR. Many of the DMRs
   that are significantly associated with local genetic variation are found
   near transposable elements that may contribute to the variation in DNA
   methylation. Analysis of gene expression in the same samples used for
   DNA methylation profiling identified over 300 genes with expression
   patterns that are significantly associated with DNA methylation
   variation. Collectively, our results suggest that DNA methylation
   variation is influenced by genetic and epigenetic changes that are often
   stably inherited and can influence the expression of nearby genes.}},

Title = {{Flexible and Extensible Preference Evaluation in Database Systems}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DATABASE SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Personalized database systems give users answers tailored to their
   personal preferences. While numerous preference evaluation methods for
   databases have been proposed (e.g., skyline, top-k, k-dominance,
   k-frequency), the implementation of these methods at the core of a
   database system is a double-edged sword. Core implementation provides
   efficient query processing for arbitrary database queries, however, this
   approach is not practical since each existing (and future) preference
   method requires implementation within the database engine. To solve this
   problem, this article introduces FlexPref, a framework for extensible
   preference evaluation in database systems. FlexPref, implemented in the
   query processor, aims to support a wide array of preference evaluation
   methods in a single extensible code base. Integration with FlexPref is
   simple, involving the registration of only three functions that capture
   the essence of the preference method. Once integrated, the preference
   method ``lives{''} at the core of the database, enabling the efficient
   execution of preference queries involving common database operations.
   This article also provides a query optimization framework for FlexPref,
   as well as a theoretical framework that defines the properties a
   preference method must exhibit to be implemented in FlexPref. To
   demonstrate the extensibility of FlexPref, this article also provides
   case studies detailing the implementation of seven state-of-the-art
   preference evaluation methods within FlexPref. We also experimentally
   study the strengths and weaknesses of an implementation of FlexPref in
   PostgreSQL over a range of single-table and multitable preference
   queries.}},

Abstract = {{A small scale biodiesel production facility based on the Mcgyan process
   is simulated in HYSYS and a follow-up techno-economic analysis is
   performed. Two feedstocks are analyzed: a soybean oil and waste cooking
   oil analogs. It is found that the soybean oil based process is not
   economical at such small scales, whereas the waste oil case has an NPV
   of \$618K with an internal rate of return of 80\%. The economic
   feasibility of a distributed system of small scale biodiesel production
   facilities in Greater London using waste vegetable cooking feedstock is
   also investigated. It is found that this system is feasible with a total
   of 20 installed facilities and an NPV of \$1.1MM. A scheme is then
   implemented which reduces the total capital expenditure per facility
   based on the mass production of similar facilities. As expected, this
   scheme reduces the total capital cost of the system. Finally, a Monte
   Carlo scheme is implemented to study how the variability in economic
   parameters affects the system. It is found that the system is most
   sensitive to the sale price of biodiesel but that in all cases a
   positive NPV is returned. These analyses support the feasibility of
   small scale locally based biofuel production from locally sourced
   feestocks. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by

Title = {{Mechanical response of wild-type and Alport murine lens capsules during
   osmotic swelling}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL EYE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Pages = {{87-91}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical support of basement membranes, such as the lens capsule,
   is believed to arise from one of their main constituents collagen IV.
   The basement membranes of the lens, kidney, and ear normally contain two
   different types of collagen IV networks, referred to as the major and
   minor chain networks. In Alport syndrome, a mutation in one of the minor
   chain COL4 genes leads to the absence of the minor chain network,
   causing life-threatening disturbances. We hypothesized that the absence
   of the minor chain network increases basement membrane distensibility,
   as measured in wild-type (is = 25) and Alport syndrome (71 = 21) mice
   using the lens capsule as a model. Osmotic swelling experiments revealed
   direction-dependent changes. As a reflection of lens capsule properties,
   Alport lenses strained significantly more than wild-type lenses in the
   anterior-posterior direction, i.e. along their thickness, but not in the
   equatorial direction (p = 0.03 and p = 0.08, respectively). This is
   consistent with clinical data: Alport patients develop conical
   protrusions on the anterior and posterior lenticular poles. There was no
   evidence of significant change in total amount of collagen between
   Alport and wild-type lenses (p = 0.6). The observed differences in
   distensibility could indicate that the major chain network alone cannot
   fully compensate for the absence of the more highly cross-linked minor
   chain network, which is believed to be stronger, more stable, and
   resistant to deformation. The addition of mechanical information on
   Alport syndrome to the currently available biological data provides a
   fuller picture into the progression of the disease. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Quadcopter control in three-dimensional space using a noninvasive motor
   imagery-based brain-computer interface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. At the balanced intersection of human and machine adaptation
   is found the optimally functioning brain-computer interface (BCI). In
   this study, we report a novel experiment of BCI controlling a robotic
   quadcopter in three-dimensional (3D) physical space using noninvasive
   scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) in human subjects. We then quantify the
   performance of this system using metrics suitable for asynchronous BCI.
   Lastly, we examine the impact that the operation of a real world device
   has on subjects' control in comparison to a 2D virtual cursor task.
   Approach. Five human subjects were trained to modulate their
   sensorimotor rhythms to control an AR Drone navigating a 3D physical
   space. Visual feedback was provided via a forward facing camera on the
   hull of the drone. Main results. Individual subjects were able to
   accurately acquire up to 90.5\% of all valid targets presented while
   travelling at an average straight-line speed of 0.69 m s(-1).
   Significance. Freely exploring and interacting with the world around us
   is a crucial element of autonomy that is lost in the context of
   neurodegenerative disease. Brain-computer interfaces are systems that
   aim to restore or enhance a user's ability to interact with the
   environment via a computer and through the use of only thought. We
   demonstrate for the first time the ability to control a flying robot in
   3D physical space using noninvasive scalp recorded EEG in humans. Our
   work indicates the potential of noninvasive EEG-based BCI systems for
   accomplishing complex control in 3D physical space. The present study
   may serve as a framework for the investigation of multidimensional
   noninvasive BCI control in a physical environment using telepresence
   robotics.}},

   stimulation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) near the pedunculopontine
   nucleus (PPN) has been posited to improve medication-intractable gait
   and balance problems in patients with Parkinson's disease. However,
   clinical studies evaluating this DBS target have not demonstrated
   consistent therapeutic effects, with several studies reporting the
   emergence of paresthesia and oculomotor side effects. The spatial and
   pathway-specific extent to which brainstem regions are modulated during
   PPN-DBS is not well understood. Approach. Here, we describe two
   computational models that estimate the direct effects of DBS in the PPN
   region for human and translational non-human primate (NHP) studies. The
   three-dimensional models were constructed from segmented histological
   images from each species, multi-compartment neuron models and
   inhomogeneous finite element models of the voltage distribution in the
   brainstem during DBS. Main Results. The computational models predicted
   that: (1) the majority of PPN neurons are activated with -3 V monopolar
   cathodic stimulation; (2) surgical targeting errors of as little as 1 mm
   in both species decrement activation selectivity; (3) specifically,
   monopolar stimulation in caudal, medial, or anterior PPN activates a
   significant proportion of the superior cerebellar peduncle (up to 60\%
   in the human model and 90\% in the NHP model at -3 V); (4) monopolar
   stimulation in rostral, lateral or anterior PPN activates a large
   percentage of medial lemniscus fibers (up to 33\% in the human model and
   40\% in the NHP model at -3 V) and (5) the current clinical cylindrical
   electrode design is suboptimal for isolating the modulatory effects to
   PPN neurons. Significance. We show that a DBS lead design with
   radially-segmented electrodes may yield improved functional outcome for
   PPN-DBS.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents novel parallel pipelined architectures for the
   computation of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) of real signals and
   inverse FFT of Hermitian-symmetric signals using only real datapaths.
   The real FFT structure is transformed by transferring twiddle factors to
   subsequent stages, such that each stage in the proposed flow graph
   contains one column of butterfly units and one column of twiddle factor
   blocks, and each column of the flow graph contains only N samples. This
   is a key requirement for the design of architectures that are based on
   only real datapaths. This structure is then mapped to pipelined
   architectures. The proposed architectures can be used with any FFT size
   or level of parallelism, which is a power of two. A systematic method to
   design architectures for FFTs with different levels of parallelism and
   radix values is presented. By modifying the FFT flow graph for
   real-valued samples, this methodology leads to architectures with fewer
   adders, delays, and interconnections.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are transcription factors
   injected into plant cells by pathogenic bacteria of the genus
   Xanthomonas. They function as virulence factors by activating host genes
   important for disease, or as avirulence factors by turning on genes that
   provide resistance. DNA-binding specificity is encoded by polymorphic
   repeats in each protein that correspond one-to-one with different
   nucleotides. This code has facilitated target identification and opened
   new avenues for engineering disease resistance. It has also enabled TAL
   effector customization for targeted gene control, genome editing, and
   other applications. This article reviews the structural basis for TAL
   effector-DNA specificity, the impact of the TAL effector-DNA code on
   plant pathology and engineered resistance, and recent accomplishments
   and future challenges in TAL effector-based DNA targeting.}},

Title = {{Fibrillar Structure of Methylcellulose Hydrogels}},
Journal = {{BIOMACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2484-2488}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{It is well established that aqueous solutions of methylcellulose (MC)
   can form hydrogels on heating, with the rheological gel point closely
   correlated to the appearance of optical turbidity. However, the detailed
   gelation mechanism and the resulting gel structure remain poorly
   understood. Herein the fibrillar structure of aqueous MC gels was
   precisely quantified with a powerful combination of (real space)
   cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) and (reciprocal
   space) small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) techniques. The cryo-TEM
   images reveal that MC chains with a molecular weight of 300 000 g/mol
   associate into fibrils upon heating, with a remarkably uniform diameter
   of 15 +/- 2 nm over a range of concentrations. Vitrified gels also
   exhibit heterogeneity in the fibril density on the length scale of
   hundreds of nanometers, consistent with the observed optical turbidity
   of MC hydrogels. The SANS curves of gels exhibit no characteristic peaks
   or plateaus over a broad range of wavevector, q, from 0.001-0.2
   angstrom(-1). The major feature is a change in slope from I similar to
   q(-1.7) in the intermediate q range (0.001 - 0.01 angstrom(-1)) to I
   similar to q(-4) above q approximate to 0.015 angstrom(-1). The
   fibrillar nature of the gel structure was confirmed by fitting the SANS
   data consistently with a model based on the form factor for flexible
   cylinders with a polydisperse radius. This model was found to capture
   the scattering features quantitatively for MC gels varying in
   concentration from 0.09-1.3 wt \%. In agreement with the microscopy
   results, the flexible cylinder model indicated fibril diameters of 14
   +/- 1 nm for samples at elevated temperatures. This combination of
   complementary experimental techniques provides a comprehensive nanoscale
   depiction of fibrillar morphology for MC gels, which correlates very
   well with macro-scale rheological behavior and optical turbidity
   previously observed for such systems.}},

Abstract = {{Measured diurnal curves of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration have been
   used to estimate the gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem
   respiration (R), and net ecosystem production (NP) of aquatic
   communities. Open-system one-station and two-station methods have been
   employed to estimate the rate of NP, R, and GPP. We conducted field
   measurements in Minnehaha Creek, MN (44 degrees 56'N, 93 degrees 28'W),
   to quantify the spatial and temporal variabilities of DO concentrations
   and, consequently, evaluated the estimates of NP. Dimensionless analysis
   of DO mass balance revealed the dominance of local photosynthesis over
   respiration, advection, re-aeration, and dispersion along the studied
   reach. Two alternative estimation methods of stream metabolism provided
   similar estimates of NP with 0.65>k(a)T(a)>0.17 within the studied reach
   where k(a) is the re-aeration rate and T-a is the water parcel average
   travel time. The spatial variability of DO change along the creek
   revealed an average length scale of 10 m over which DO exhibited
   significant autocorrelation. The autotrophic-heterotrophic balance,
   quantified by GPP to R ratio, scaled with local stream geomorphic and
   hydraulic conditions from diverse geographic areas, providing useful
   predictive relationships expressed in terms of easily measurable abiotic
   parameters. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{While the cochlear implant has successfully restored hearing to many
   deaf patients, it cannot benefit those without a functional auditory
   nerve or an implantable cochlea. As an alternative, the auditory
   midbrain implant (AMI) has been developed and implanted into deaf
   patients. Consisting of a single-shank array, the AMI is designed for
   stimulation along the tonotopic gradient of the inferior colliculus
   (ICC). Although the AMI can provide frequency cues, it appears to
   insufficiently transmit temporal cues for speech understanding because
   repeated stimulation of a single site causes strong suppressive and
   refractory effects. Applying the electrical stimulation to at least two
   sites within an isofrequency lamina can circumvent these refractory
   processes. Moreover, coactivation with short intersite delays(<5 ms) can
   elicit cortical activation which is enhanced beyond the summation of
   activity induced by the individual sites. The goal of our study was to
   further investigate the role of the auditory cortex in this enhancement
   effect. In guinea pigs, we electrically stimulated two locations within
   an ICC lamina or along different laminae with varying interpulse
   intervals (0-10 ms) and recorded activity in different locations and
   layers of primary auditory cortex (A1). Our findings reveal a neural
   mechanism that integrates activity only from neurons located within the
   same ICC lamina for short spiking intervals (<6 ms). This mechanism
   leads to enhanced activity into layers III-V of A1 that is further
   magnified in supragranular layers. This integration mechanism may
   contribute to perceptual coding of different sound features that are
   relevant for improving AMI performance.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate roll press compaction of
   coarsely ground corn stover and native perennial grasses to produce
   compacted products with a bulk density of at least 240 kg m(-3) for
   effective truck transport. A pilot-scale roll press compaction machine
   (520.7 mm roll diameter and 127.0 mm roll width) was used to compress
   corn stover and perennial grasses (moisture contents of 10\% to 18\% wet
   basis) ground in a tub-grinder with three round-hole screen opening
   sizes (25.4, 76.2, and 127.0 mm). Bulk density of compacted materials
   (i.e., compacts) ranged from 263 kg m (-3) to 365 kg m(-3) for the roll
   compaction forces of 214-534 kN. Durability (tumbling test) of compacts
   ranged from 61\% to 92\%. Specific energy consumption (excluding no-load
   machine energy) for the roll press compaction ranged from 19 MJ Mg (1)
   to 339 MJ Mg (1). The results from this study would be useful for
   developing a biomass supply logistics system involving coarse-grinding
   followed by roll press compaction of biomass bales. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Carbonate-sandstone geology in southeastern Minnesota creates a
   heterogeneous landscape of springs, seeps, and sinkholes that supply
   groundwater into streams. Air temperatures are effective predictors of
   water temperature in surface-water dominated streams. However, no
   published work investigates the relationship between air and water
   temperatures in groundwater-fed streams (GWFS) across watersheds. We
   used simple linear regressions to examine weekly air-water temperature
   relationships for 40 GWFS in southeastern Minnesota. A 40-stream,
   composite linear regression model has a slope of 0.38, an intercept of
   6.63, and R-2 of 0.83. The regression models for GWFS have lower slopes
   and higher intercepts in comparison to surface-water dominated streams.
   Regression models for streams with high R-2 values offer promise for use
   as predictive tools for future climate conditions. Climate change is
   expected to alter the thermal regime of groundwater-fed systems, but
   will do so at a slower rate than surface-water dominated systems. A
   regression model of intercept vs. slope can be used to identify streams
   for which water temperatures are more meteorologically than groundwater
   controlled, and thus more vulnerable to climate change. Such
   relationships can be used to guide restoration vs. management strategies
   to protect trout streams.}},

Title = {{Ferromagnetic shape memory flapper for remotely actuated propulsion
   systems}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Generating propulsion with small-scale devices is a major challenge due
   to both the domination of viscous forces at low Reynolds numbers as well
   as the small relative stroke length of traditional actuators.
   Ferromagnetic shape memory materials are good candidates for such
   devices as they exhibit a unique combination of large strains and fast
   responses, and can be remotely activated by magnetic fields. This paper
   presents the design, analysis, and realization of a novel NiMnGa shear
   actuation method, which is especially suitable for small-scale fluid
   propulsion. A fluid mechanics analysis shows that the two key parameters
   for powerful propulsion are the engineering shear strain and twin
   boundary velocity. Using high-speed photography, we directly measure
   both parameters under an alternating magnetic field. Reynolds numbers in
   the inertial flow regime (>700) are evaluated. Measurements of the
   transient thrust show values up to 40 mN, significantly higher than
   biological equivalents. This work paves the way for new remotely
   activated and controlled propulsion for untethered micro-scale robots.}},

Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Given the noiseless superposition of a low-rank matrix plus the product
   of a known fat compression matrix times a sparse matrix, the goal of
   this paper is to establish deterministic conditions under which exact
   recovery of the low-rank and sparse components becomes possible. This
   fundamental identifiability issue arises with traffic anomaly detection
   in backbone networks, and subsumes compressed sensing as well as the
   timely low-rank plus sparse matrix recovery tasks encountered in matrix
   decomposition problems. Leveraging the ability of l(1) and nuclear norms
   to recover sparse and low-rank matrices, a convex program is formulated
   to estimate the unknowns. Analysis and simulations confirm that the said
   convex program can recover the unknowns for sufficiently low-rank and
   sparse enough components, along with a compression matrix possessing an
   isometry property when restricted to operate on sparse vectors. When the
   low-rank, sparse, and compression matrices are drawn from certain random
   ensembles, it is established that exact recovery is possible with high
   probability. First-order algorithms are developed to solve the nonsmooth
   convex optimization problem with provable iteration complexity
   guarantees. Insightful tests with synthetic and real network data
   corroborate the effectiveness of the novel approach in unveiling traffic
   anomalies across flows and time, and its ability to outperform existing
   alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Laboratory measurements of dissolved oxygen (DO) uptake by Glossosoma
   nigrior Banks were conducted in a sealed, recirculating flume under
   variable fluid flow velocities. Measurements were performed in similar
   water temperatures, DO concentrations and fluid flow velocities to field
   conditions in the stream where the larvae were obtained. Total oxygen
   uptake by both cased larvae and corresponding cases without larvae were
   quantified. An increased fluid flow velocity corresponded to an
   increased larval DO uptake rate. Oxygen uptake by the larval cases alone
   was not as sensitive to changes in the Peclet (Pe) number, the
   dimensionless ratio of advective to diffusive DO transport, as uptake by
   larvae themselves. The flux of DO to larvae and their cases was up to
   seven times larger in a moving fluid in comparison to non-moving fluid
   conditions in the proximity of larvae for 0<Pe<175. A functional
   relationship was developed relating fluid flow and DO uptake across a
   larval case. According to the proposed quantitative relationship, Pe
   alone describes 91\% of the variation in the DO flux to the larvae under
   variable fluid flow conditions. In response to fluid motion, larvae
   depicted two characteristic behavioral responses. When the ratio of
   advective DO transport to diffusive transport was low (Pe<87), larvae
   occasionally abandoned their cases or spent more time partially extended
   from their cases. At Pe>87, larvae typically remained in their cases.
   This indicates that oxygen delivery to the larvae at low Pe is
   insufficient to satisfy the respiratory demands of cased larvae.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a model whereby players compete for a set of shared
   resources to produce and sell substitute products in the same market,
   which can be viewed as a generalization of the classical Cournot
   oligopolistic competition model, or, from a different angle, the Wardrop
   type routing model. In particular, we suppose that there are K players,
   who compete for the usage of resources as well as the sales of the
   end-products. Moreover, the unit costs of the shared resources and the
   selling prices of the products are assumed to be affine linear functions
   in the consumption/production quantities. We show that the price of
   anarchy in this case is lower bounded by 1/K, and this bound is
   essentially tight, which manifests the harsh nature of the competitive
   market for the producers.}},

Abstract = {{In many applications, it is of interest to derive information about the
   topology and the internal connections of multiple dynamical systems
   interacting together. Examples can be found in fields as diverse as
   Economics, Neuroscience and Biochemistry. The paper deals with the
   problem of deriving a descriptive model of a network with no a-priori
   knowledge on its topology. It is assumed that the network nodes are
   passively observed and data are collected in the form of time series.
   The underlying structure is then determined by the non-zero entries of a
   ``sparse Wiener filter{''}. We cast the problem as the optimization of a
   quadratic cost function, where a set of parameters are used to operate a
   trade-off between accuracy and complexity in the final model. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Mutation-induced drug resistance in cancer often causes the failure of
   therapies and cancer recurrence, despite an initial tumor reduction. The
   timing of such cancer recurrence is governed by a balance between
   several factors such as initial tumor size, mutation rates and growth
   kinetics of drug-sensitive and resistance cells. To study this
   phenomenon we characterize the dynamics of escape from extinction of a
   subcritical branching process, where the establishment of a clone of
   escape mutants can lead to total population growth after the initial
   decline. We derive uniform in-time approximations for the paths of the
   escape process and its components, in the limit as the initial
   population size tends to infinity and the mutation rate tends to zero.
   In addition, two stochastic times important in cancer recurrence will be
   characterized: (i) the time at which the total population size first
   begins to rebound (i.e., become supercritical) during treatment, and
   (ii) the first time at which the resistant cell population begins to
   dominate the tumor.}},

   Measurements}},
Journal = {{IEEE SENSORS JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3106-3114}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel sensing system for the non-intrusive
   real-time measurement of piston position inside a cylinder. The proposed
   sensor exploits the principle that any ferromagnetic object has an
   inherent magnetic field which varies as a function of position around
   the object. Through modeling the magnetic field as a function of
   position and using sensors to measure magnetic field intensity, the
   position of the object can be estimated. This principle is used to
   measure the piston position in a free piston engine without requiring
   any sensors inside the engine cylinder. The piston is approximated as a
   rectangular metallic object and the variation of the magnetic field
   around it is modeled. A challenge arises from the fact that the
   parameters of the model vary from engine to engine and are cumbersome to
   calibrate for each engine. This challenge is addressed by utilizing two
   magnetic field sensors with known longitudinal separation between them.
   A number of estimation methods are proposed that identify and update
   magnetic field parameters in real time without requiring an additional
   linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) sensor for calibration.
   The advantages and performance of these estimation methods are compared.
   Experimental results from a free piston engine setup show that the
   proposed sensor can provide 0.4 mm accuracy in position estimates. The
   proposed sensing concept can be utilized for piston position measurement
   in multi-cylinder SI and diesel engines, hydraulic cylinders, pneumatic
   cylinders, and in many other position measurement applications.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of urban development on the volume of storm water runoff
   and on water temperature, and the associated impact on streams in urban
   watersheds, has generated a need for tools to predict the temperature of
   urban storm water runoff, particularly for the assessment of future
   urban development. To address this need, the Minnesota Urban Heat Export
   Tool (MINUHET) model was developed to simulate the flow of heat and
   storm water through a small urban watershed for a rainfall-runoff event.
   The tool includes process-based hydrological and thermal models for
   runoff from developed, undeveloped, or vegetated land uses, for various
   components of drainage networks, and for some best management practices
   such as detention and infiltration ponds, storm water vaults, and rock
   cribs. The primary output of MINUHET is a time series of the flow rate
   and temperature of runoff, which can be used to determine the heat
   content of the runoff at the outlet of the modeled watershed and aid in
   the assessment of the thermal impact on receiving waters. This paper
   provides an overview of the hydrologic and heat transfer processes
   simulated by MINUHET and presents a case study in which MINUHET is
   applied to a 5.06-hectare (12.5-acre) residential neighborhood in
   Plymouth, Minnesota for which runoff flow and temperature data were
   available for a series of rainfall events. The model was manually
   calibrated to several parameters, including saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, Manning's roughness, and thermal diffusivity and heat
   capacity of asphalt. Runoff flow rate, runoff temperature, and heat
   export (heat content of the runoff relative to a specified reference
   temperature) were accurately simulated for a total of four rainfall
   events using the calibrated parameters. A sensitivity analysis of the
   model revealed that simulations were especially sensitive to dew point
   (rainfall) temperature, rainfall rate and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity, and to thermal properties and thickness of asphalt. These
   results illustrate the importance of both data quality and a truthful
   representation of the modeled watershed in producing accurate
   simulations with MINUHET. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Low-temperature cracking is a significant distress in asphalt pavements
   built in the northern United States and Canada. As temperature
   decreases, thermal stresses develop in the restrained asphalt surface
   layer; and when the temperature reaches a critical temperature, cracking
   occurs. The current guides use thermal stress as a critical input
   parameter in the low-temperature performance model. In this paper,
   statistical and graphical analyses are performed to compare thermal
   stresses that develop in an idealized asphalt pavement calculated from
   mixture creep data obtained using indirect tensile test (IDT) and
   bending beam rheometer (BBR) test. In addition, the idea of obtaining
   thermal stresses from binder BBR creep data is further investigated.
   Thermal stresses calculated using IDT and BBR mixture creep data,
   respectively, are similar. Thermal stresses calculated from binder creep
   data are significantly different than thermal stresses calculated from
   mixture creep data. The effect of physical hardening is investigated for
   a limited number of materials, and the effect on thermal stresses is
   significant. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The resistance of prestressed concrete through-girder (PCTG) pedestrian
   bridges to lateral loads was studied in response to the increasing
   number of vehicular impacts in the United States. This research was

   vulnerability in comparison with bridges that are better able to
   redistribute and transfer locally applied impact loads through alternate
   load paths. Pedestrian bridges are of lighter construction than highway
   bridges and they do not have the high degree of redundancy, making them
   more vulnerable to collapse in the event of vehicular impact. Results
   from static lateral load analyses using three-dimensional, geometrically
   nonlinear, full-scale finite element (FE) models of a typical bridge
   system and bridge subassemblages were used to evaluate the
   characteristics of the system. The FE models were calibrated with
   experimental test data on typical subassemblages and connection details
   for PCTG bridges. Results of the experimental part of the program have
   already been published elsewhere. This paper summarizes the observations
   obtained from nonlinear static FE analyses of a PCTG pedestrian bridge
   system subjected to lateral impact loads. The analyses indicated that
   the location of impact, the type of connector, and the flexibility of
   the end support details affected bridge performance. Improved connection
   details are suggested for enhanced PCTG pedestrian bridge performance.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrically braced frames (CBFs) are stiff, strong systems frequently
   used to resist seismic loading. Special CBF (SCBF) behavior is dominated
   by brace buckling, while buckling restrained braced frames (BRBFs)
   develop tensile and compressive yielding and avoid brace buckling. Both
   systems are widely used in seismic design, and both have a number of
   specific design issues. This paper describes a first of its kind,
   2-story, 1-bay by 1-bay frame tested at the University of Minnesota
   Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation facility to examine the
   large-displacement, bidirectional behavior of SCBFs and BRBFs with
   realistic boundary conditions and to verify the design approach. The
   SCBF had rectangular hollow steel section (HSS) braces in a single-story
   X configuration, and the BRBF used a single-diagonal configuration. The
   design of the gusset plates for the HSS braces followed a previously
   proposed balanced design procedure with an elliptical clearance to
   permit out-of-plane rotation caused by brace buckling. The single-story
   X-brace SCBF concentrated damaged into one-half the brace length, and
   the first HSS brace fractured at 2\% story drift. The BRBF gusset-plate
   design followed current design standards, and two of the BRB cores
   fractured at 3.6 and 4.2\% story drift prior to any instability in the
   BRB or system. The SCBF sustained limited damage to the beams and
   columns; however, the BRBF had much more significant damage to these
   members because of larger deformations and BRBF behavior. The results
   indicate that these systems have a stable response to large cyclic
   deformations and the impact of bidirectional loading on the measured
   response was minimal.}},

Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{1-14}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The effects of large-scale mixing and vapor concentration on homogeneous
   nucleation rates are investigated via direct numerical simulation of
   dibutyl-phthalate (DBP) nucleation during cooling and mixing in
   three-dimensional planar jets. In the simulated cases, a heated jet
   doped with DBP issues into a co-flow of room-temperature air. As the two
   streams mix, the DBP vapor becomes highly supersaturated and particles
   are formed by nucleation. This particle formation takes place in the
   absence of condensation or coagulation. The simulation results provide a
   demonstration of how nucleation takes place in narrow regions where
   molecular mixing of the two streams occurs. When maximum nucleation
   rates occur in conditions where the nucleation rates are sensitive to
   ambient conditions, islands of nucleation form. There are two possible
   nucleation events: initial shear layer nucleation, and later nucleation
   in coherent structures or eddies generated by the velocity difference
   between the jet and the co-flow. A scatter plot diagram of observed
   dilution paths in temperature versus condensable vapor concentration
   space where nucleation rates are superimposed is shown to be a
   convenient tool for analyzing nucleation events. Convection
   by-large-scale eddies gradually spreads the range of mixing paths in
   this space toward higher nucleation rates. The results also show that
   boundary conditions, including inlet concentration and velocity ratio,
   have both qualitative and quantitative effects on particle nucleation.

Abstract = {{Thin-bonded bituminous overlays are becoming an increasingly popular
   pavement maintenance treatment, which can be used to restore smoothness,
   seal and renew the pavement surface and increase skid resistance.
   Thin-bonded overlays (TBOs) are constructed using a specialised type of
   paving equipment called a spray paver'. A spray paver combines the
   operation of applying a tack coat and laying down asphalt concrete in a
   single pass. This allows for the application of a high rate of
   polymer-modified asphalt emulsion tack coat. Due to reduced thickness,
   cracking distress is more of a concern in this type of system. This
   paper describes a new approach for the evaluation of the cracking
   performance of TBO systems through fracture mechanics-based testing of
   laboratory and field specimens. Computer simulations and early field
   performance data are also used in the evaluation. This study is
   conducted in the context of three field projects which encompass seven
   different pavement test sections. The test sections allowed a number of
   variables to be studied, including type and application rate of tack
   coat emulsion and type of hot-mix asphalt gradation structure (gap
   graded vs. dense graded). Comparisons are also made between overlays
   constructed using spray paver and conventional paving process. All seven
   sections were computationally simulated to evaluate their performance in
   the context of thermal and reflective cracking potential. Fairly good
   agreement is observed between laboratory tests, computer simulations and
   field performance data. The results indicate that good thermal and
   reflective cracking resistance are expected from TBOs. Furthermore, it
   was observed that the cracking performance of TBOs depends on the type
   of gradation for the overlay mixture and the tack coat emulsion type and
   its application rate.}},

Abstract = {{Functional images of the resting brain can be empirically parsed into
   intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) which closely resemble patterns
   of evoked task-based brain activity and which have a biological and
   genetic basis. Recently, ICNs have become popular for investigating
   brain functioning and brain-behavior relationships. However, the
   replicability and neurometrics of these networks are only beginning to
   be reported. Using a meta-level independent component analysis (ICA), we
   produced ICNs from three data sets collected from two samples of healthy
   adults. The ICNs from our data sets demonstrated robust and independent
   replication of 12 intrinsic networks that reflected 17 canonical,
   task-based, brain networks. We found within-subject reliability of ICNs
   was modest overall, but ranged from poor to good, and that voxels with
   the highest measured connectivity rarely had the highest reliability.
   Networks associated with executive functions, visuospatial reasoning,
   motor coordination, speech and audition, default mode, vision, and
   interoception showed moderate to high group-level reproducibility and
   replicability. However, only the first four of these networks also
   showed fair or better within-subject reliability over time. Our findings
   highlight the replicability of ICNs across data sets, the range of
   within-subject neurometrics across different networks, and the shared
   characteristics between resting and task-based networks. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This article analyzes three types of supply contracts between a supplier
   and a retailer when both agree as followsif a customer experiences a
   stockout, then the purchased item can be shipped to the customer on an
   expedited basis at no extra cost. This practice is referred to as the
   fast-ship option in this article. In the first contract (Structure A),
   the supplier specifies a total supply commitment and allows the retailer
   to choose its split between the initial order and the amount left to
   satisfy fast-ship orders. In the other two contracts (Structures B and
   C), the supplier agrees to fully supply the retailer's initial order but
   places a restriction on the quantity available for fast-ship commitment.
   The difference between the second and third contracts is that in
   contract Structure B the supplier moves first, whereas in contract
   Structure C the supplier determines its commitment after observing the
   retailer's order. The supplier's and the retailer's optimal decisions
   and preferences are characterized. The question of how the supplier and
   the retailer may resolve their conflict regarding the preferred contract
   type is addressed. {[}Supplementary materials are available for this

Abstract = {{Metal-oxides have been used as interlayers at the anode-organic

   the maximum V-OC in a planar heterojunction OPV and find that the

   subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc)-C-60 OPVs that contain no interlayer
   show a maximum V-OC of 1.2V at low temperature, while those with MoOx
   show no saturation, reaching V-OC > 1.4 V. We propose that the

   additional contribution to V-OC at low temperature. (C) 2013 AIP

   Conduction and recombination in the central quantum dot region is
   described by a system of coupled rate equations, and the drift-diffusion
   approximation is used for the hole and electron transport layers. For
   NiO/Si-QDs/ZnO devices with suitable design parameter, the current and
   light output are primarily controlled by the quantum dot layers,
   specifically, their radiative and non-radiative recombination
   coefficients. Radiative recombination limits the device current only at

   50 nm) annealed at 120 degrees C have the best performance and display
   an unusual combination of metrics including sub-1-V operation, ON/OFF
   current ratios of 106, OFF currents of <10(-10) A (<10(-6) A cm(-2)),
   saturation hole mobilities of 1.3 cm(2) V-1 s(-1), threshold voltages of
   -0.3 V, and subthreshold swings of 70 mV decade(-1). Furthermore,
   optimized EGTs printed on polyester substrates are extremely robust to

Abstract = {{Matrix molecules convey biochemical and physical guiding signals to
   neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and shape the trajectory of
   neuronal fibers that constitute neural networks. We have developed
   recombinant human IgMs that bind to epitopes on neural cells, with the
   aim of treating neurological diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that
   recombinant human IgMs (rHIgM) can guide neurite outgrowth of CNS
   neurons. Microcontact printing was employed to pattern rHIgM12 and
   rHIgM22, antibodies that were bioengineered to have variable regions
   capable of binding to neurons or oligodendrocytes, respectively. rHIgM12
   promoted neuronal attachment and guided outgrowth of neurites from
   hippocampal neurons. Processes from spinal neurons followed grid
   patterns of rHIgM12 and formed a physical network. Comparison between
   rHIgM12 and rHIgM22 suggested the biochemistry that facilitates
   anchoring the neuronal surfaces is a prerequisite for the function of
   IgM, and spatial properties cooperate in guiding the assembly of
   neuronal networks.}},

Abstract = {{The success of common nonviral gene delivery vehicles, lipoplexes and
   polyplexes, is limited by the toxicity and instability of these charged
   molecules. Stealth liposomes could provide a stable, safe alternative to
   cationic DNA complexes for effective gene delivery. DNA encapsulations
   in three stealth liposomal formulations prepared by thin film, reverse
   phase evaporation, and asymmetric liposome formation were compared, and
   the thin film method was found to produce the highest yields of
   encapsulated DNA. A DNA quantification method appropriate for DNA
   encapsulated within liposomes was also developed and verified for
   accuracy. The effect of initial lipid and DNA concentrations on the
   encapsulation yield and fraction of DNA-filled liposomes was evaluated.
   Higher encapsulation yields were achieved by higher lipid contents,
   while a higher fraction of DNA-filled liposomes was produced by either
   lower lipid content or higher DNA concentration. Control of these
   parameters allows for the design of gene delivery nanopartides with high
   DNA encapsulation yields or higher fraction of DNA-filled liposomes.}},

Title = {{Evolving Tip Structures Can Explain Age-Dependent Microtubule
   Catastrophe}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are key structural and transport elements in cells. The
   dynamics at microtubule ends are characterized by periods of slow
   growth, followed by stochastic switching events termed
   ``catastrophes,{''} in which microtubules suddenly undergo rapid
   shortening {[}1]. Growing microtubules are thought to be protected from
   catastrophe by a GTP-tubulin ``cap{''}: GTP-tubulin subunits add to the
   tips of growing microtubules but are subsequently hydrolyzed to
   GDP-tubulin subunits once they are incorporated into the microtubule
   lattice {[}2-4]. Loss of the GTP-tubulin cap exposes GDP-tubulin
   subunits at the microtubule tip, resulting in a catastrophe event
   {[}5-9]. However, the mechanistic basis for sudden loss of the GTP cap,
   leading to catastrophe, is not known. To investigate microtubule
   catastrophe events, we performed 3D mechanochemical simulations that
   account for interactions between neighboring protofilaments {[}10-12].
   We found that there are two separate factors that contribute to
   catastrophe events in the 3D simulation: the GTP-tubulin cap size, which
   settles into a steady-state value that depends on the free tubulin
   concentration during microtubule growth, and the structure of the
   microtubule tip. Importantly, 3D simulations predict, and both
   fluorescence and electron microscopy experiments confirm, that
   microtubule tips become more tapered as the microtubule grows. This
   effect destabilizes the tip and ultimately contributes to microtubule
   catastrophe. Thus, the likelihood of a catastrophe event may be
   intimately linked to the aging physical structure of the growing
   microtubule tip. These results have important consequences for
   catastrophe regulation in cells, as microtubule-associated proteins
   could promote catastrophe events in part by modifying microtubule tip
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{The technology of packed bed dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma
   followed by a chemical absorption has been developed and was found to be
   an efficient way for decomposition treatment of sulfuryl fluoride
   (SO2F2) in simulated residual fumigant. The effects of energy density,
   initial SO2F2 concentration, and residence time on the removal
   efficiency of SO2F2 for the DBD plasma treatment alone were
   investigated. It was found that the SO2F2 could be removed completely
   when initial volume concentration, energy density, and residence time
   were 0.5\%, 33.9 kJ/L, and 5.1 s, respectively. The removal mechanism of
   SO2F2 in the packed bed DBD reactor was discussed. Based on the detailed
   analysis of SO2F2 molecular stability and its exhaust products in the
   DBD plasma reactor, it was concluded that the energetic electrons
   generated in the packed bed DBD reactor played a key role on the removal
   of SO2F2, and the major decomposition products of SO2F2 detected were
   SO2, SiF4, and S (Sulfur). Among these products, SiF4 was formed by the
   F atom reacted with the filler-quartz glass beads (SiO2) in the packed
   bed DBD reactor. Aqueous NaOH solution was used as the chemical
   absorbent for the gaseous products of SO2F2 after plasma pretreatment.
   It was found that the gaseous products in the plasma exhaust could be
   absorbed and fixed by the subsequent aqueous NaOH solution.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a high-efficiency grating coupler (GC) fabricated on a

   limitation of 248 nm deep ultraviolet lithography. The measured average
   insertion loss is 3.1 +/- 0.2 dB similar to 1550 nm with a 1 dB
   bandwidth of 41 +/- 4 nm for TE polarization, whereas the best device
   exhibits 2.7 dB loss. The measured GC backreflection loss is better than
   17 dB across the wafer. Cross-wafer data shows good uniformity and
   tolerance to fabrication variations. This is the best result reported
   for the commonly used 220 nm thickness Si that uses only a shallow etch

Abstract = {{The diaphragm has an inspiratory action on the lower ribs, and current
   conventional wisdom maintains that this action is the result of two
   mechanisms, namely, the force applied by the muscle fibres on the ribs
   into which they insert (insertional force) and the transmission of
   abdominal pressure through the zone of apposition (appositional force).
   The magnitude of the diaphragmatic force and the relative contributions
   of the insertional and appositional components, however, are unknown. To
   assess these forces, the inspiratory intercostal muscles in all
   interspaces were severed in anaesthetized dogs, so that the diaphragm
   was the only muscle active during inspiration, and the displacements of
   the lower ribs along the craniocaudal and laterolateral axes were
   measured during quiet breathing, during occluded breaths and during
   passive lung inflation. From these data, the isolated effects of pleural
   pressure and transdiaphragmatic pressure on rib displacement were
   determined. Then external forces were applied to the ribs in the cranial
   and the lateral direction to simulate, respectively, the effects of the
   insertional and appositional forces, and the rib trajectories for these
   external forces were used as the basis for a vector analysis to obtain
   the relative magnitudes of the insertional and appositional
   contributions to the rib displacement driven by transdiaphragmatic
   pressure. The results show that, per unit pressure, the inspiratory
   effect of the diaphragmatic force on the lower ribs is equal to the
   expiratory effect of pleural pressure, and that the insertional force
   contributes 60\% of that inspiratory effect.}},

Abstract = {{Gene duplication results in two identical paralogs that diverge through
   mutation, leading to loss or gain of interactions with other
   biomolecules. Here, we comprehensively characterize such network
   rewiring for C. elegans transcription factors (TFs) within and across
   four newly delineated molecular networks. Remarkably, we find that even
   highly similar TFs often have different interaction degrees and
   partners. In addition, we find that most TF families have a member that
   is highly connected in multiple networks. Further, different TF families
   have opposing correlations between network connectivity and phylogenetic
   age, suggesting that they are subject to different evolutionary
   pressures. Finally, TFs that have similar partners in one network
   generally do not in another, indicating a lack of pressure to retain
   cross-network similarity. Our multiparameter analyses provide unique
   insights into the evolutionary dynamics that shaped TF networks.}},

   local analysis of nonlinear systems. Specifically, sufficient conditions
   are provided for bounds on the reachable set and L-2 gain of the

   theoretical results are extensions of classical dissipation inequalities
   but enforced only on local regions of the state and input space.
   Computational algorithms are derived from these local results by
   restricting to polynomial systems, using convex relaxations, for example
   the S-procedure, and applying sum-of-squares optimizations. Several
   pedagogical and realistic examples are provided to illustrate the
   proposed approach. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Comparison of Profile Similarity Measures for Genetic Interaction
   Networks}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{Analysis of genetic interaction networks often involves identifying
   genes with similar profiles, which is typically indicative of a common
   function. While several profile similarity measures have been applied in
   this context, they have never been systematically benchmarked. We
   compared a diverse set of correlation measures, including measures
   commonly used by the genetic interaction community as well as several
   other candidate measures, by assessing their utility in extracting
   functional information from genetic interaction data. We find that the
   dot product, one of the simplest vector operations, outperforms most
   other measures over a large range of gene pairs. More generally, linear
   similarity measures such as the dot product, Pearson correlation or
   cosine similarity perform better than set overlap measures such as
   Jaccard coefficient. Similarity measures that involve L-2-normalization
   of the profiles tend to perform better for the top-most similar pairs
   but perform less favorably when a larger set of gene pairs is considered
   or when the genetic interaction data is thresholded. Such measures are
   also less robust to the presence of noise and batch effects in the
   genetic interaction data. Overall, the dot product measure performs
   consistently among the best measures under a variety of different
   conditions and genetic interaction datasets.}},

Title = {{Temperature sensitivity of cellulase adsorption on lignin and its impact

Abstract = {{Unproductive enzyme adsorption is an important factor in addition to
   steric hindrance of lignin that limits the enzymatic hydrolysis of
   lignocellulosic biomass. While both are important factors, enzymatic
   hydrolysis of pretreated biomass is most likely conducted in the
   presence of certain amount of lignin residues that may not necessarily
   present accessibility hindrance, but can competitively absorb the
   enzyme. This paper presents a study with purified lignin samples to
   elucidate the role of unproductive enzyme adsorption. It appeared that
   lignin adsorbed cellulase quickly at 4 degrees C with adsorption
   equilibrium reached within 1 h, similar to that observed for crystalline
   cellulose. Increasing temperature to 50 degrees C (typical hydrolytic
   reaction condition) facilitated the rate of cellulase adsorption on
   cellulose with a peak of adsorption reached at 0.25 h; however,
   adsorption on lignin was surprisingly slower and took over 12 h to reach
   equilibrium, which was accompanied with a 10-fold increase in adsorption
   capacity. Despite the high adsorption capacity of lignin (which is
   comparable to that of cellulose) at 50 degrees C, the presence of added
   lignin imposed only minimal impact on the enzyme apparent activity, most
   likely due to the slow adsorption kinetics of lignin. (c) 2013 The

   systematic changes to alkyl substitution patterns manifested as
   differences in optical, thermal, and microstructural properties. Density
   functional theory (DFT) analysis provided support for the observed
   differences among all polymers. In addition, C-13 NMR and IR analysis of

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL 8}},
Abstract = {{There will be a huge impact on development of photovoltaics if the
   energy conversion efficiency (ECE) can be further enhanced using
   low-cost strategy, because ECE promotion under the promise of low-cost
   is very challenging. Here we show a simple, controllable, and low-cost
   approach to create wrinkles and nanogaps on a shrink polymer substrate
   as a photocathode, demonstrating an ECE enhancement of 34\% in
   dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs). The wrinkles and nanogaps can be
   generated based on the stress mismatch between surface coated
   nanomaterials and shrink polymer substrate during heat shrink process.
   With the assistance of shrink induced nanostructures on light trapping
   and manipulation, the incident photon to current conversion efficiency
   of DSSCs is greatly enhanced. We anticipate that the controllable shrink
   induced nanostructures represent a general low-cost approach to
   accelerate the development of photovoltaic devices with higher ECE. (C)

Abstract = {{Electrical properties tomography (EPT) is a recently developed
   noninvasive technology to image the electrical conductivity and
   permittivity of biological tissues at Larmor frequency in magnetic
   resonance scanners. The absolute phase of the complex radio-frequency
   magnetic field (B-1) is necessary for electrical property calculation.
   However, due to the lack of practical methods to directly measure the
   absolute B-1 phases, current EPT techniques have been achieved with B-1
   phase estimation based on certain assumptions on object anatomy, coil
   structure and/or electromagnetic wave behavior associated with the main
   magnetic field, limiting EPT from a larger variety of applications. In
   this study, using a multi-channel transmit/receive coil, the framework
   of a new general approach for EPT has been introduced, which is
   independent on the assumptions utilized in previous studies. Using a
   human head model with realistic geometry, a series of computer
   simulations at 7 T were conducted to evaluate the proposed method under
   different noise levels. Results showed that the proposed method can be
   used to reconstruct the conductivity and permittivity images with
   noticeable accuracy and stability. The feasibility of this approach was
   further evaluated in a phantom experiment at 7 T.}},

   properties of the material at the nanoscale. In this paper, we report a
   method for simultaneously determining the topography, stiffness and
   dissipative properties of materials at the nanoscale in a probe based
   dynamic mode operation. The method is particularly suited for
   investigating soft-matter such as polymers and bio-matter. We use
   perturbation analysis tools for mapping dissipative and stiffness
   properties of material into parameters of an equivalent linear
   time-invariant model. Parameters of the equivalent model are adaptively
   estimated, where, for robust estimation, a multi-frequency excitation of
   the probe is introduced. We demonstrate that the reported method of
   simultaneously determining multiple material properties can be
   implemented in real-time on existing probe based instruments. We further
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by investigating properties
   of a polymer blend in real-time.}},

Abstract = {{FTIR and confocal Raman microspectroscopy were used to measure
   interactions between albumin and ice in situ during quasi equilibrium
   freezing in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) solutions. At temperatures of -4
   and -6 degrees C, albumin was found to be preferentially excluded from
   the ice phase during near equilibrium freezing. This behavior reversed
   at lower temperatures Instead, DMSO was preferentially excluded from the
   ice phase, resulting in an albumin concentration in the
   freeze-concentrated liquid phase that was lower than predicted. It is
   hypothesized that this was caused by the albumin in the
   freeze-concentrated liquid getting adsorbed onto the ice surface or
   becoming entrapped in the ice phase. It was observed that, under certain
   freezing protocols, as much as 20\% of the albumin in solutions with
   starting concentrations of 32-53 mg/mL may be adsorbed onto the ice
   interface or entrapped in the ice phase.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembly of ABA triblocks in ionic liquids provides a versatile
   route to highly functional physical ion gels, with promise in
   applications ranging from plastic electronics to gas separation.
   However, the reversibility of network formation, so favorable for
   processing, restricts the ultimate mechanical strength of the material.
   Here, we describe a novel ABA system that can be chemically cross linked
   in a second annealing step, thereby providing greatly enhanced
   toughness. The ABA triblock is a poly(styrene-b-ethylene
   oxide-b-styrene) polymer in which about 25 mol \% of the styrene units
   have a pendant azide functionality. After self-assembly of 10 wt \%
   triblock in the ionic liquid {[}EMI]{[}TFSA], the styrene domains are
   cross linked by annealing at elevated temperature for ca. 20 min. The
   high ionic conductivity (ca. 10 mS/cm) of the physical ion gels is
   preserved in the final product, while the tensile strength is increased
   by a factor of 5.}},

Title = {{Large-scale integrative network-based analysis identifies common
   pathways disrupted by copy number alterations across cancers}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{JUL 3}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many large-scale studies analyzed high-throughput genomic
   data to identify altered pathways essential to the development and
   progression of specific types of cancer. However, no previous study has
   been extended to provide a comprehensive analysis of pathways disrupted
   by copy number alterations across different human cancers. Towards this
   goal, we propose a network-based method to integrate copy number
   alteration data with human protein-protein interaction networks and
   pathway databases to identify pathways that are commonly disrupted in
   many different types of cancer.
   Results: We applied our approach to a data set of 2,172 cancer patients
   across 16 different types of cancers, and discovered a set of commonly
   disrupted pathways, which are likely essential for tumor formation in
   majority of the cancers. We also identified pathways that are only
   disrupted in specific cancer types, providing molecular markers for
   different human cancers. Analysis with independent microarray gene
   expression datasets confirms that the commonly disrupted pathways can be
   used to identify patient subgroups with significantly different survival
   outcomes. We also provide a network view of disrupted pathways to
   explain how copy number alterations affect pathways that regulate cell
   growth, cycle, and differentiation for tumorigenesis.
   Conclusions: In this work, we demonstrated that the network-based
   integrative analysis can help to identify pathways disrupted by copy
   number alterations across 16 types of human cancers, which are not
   readily identifiable by conventional overrepresentation-based and other
   pathway-based methods. All the results and source code are available at

Abstract = {{Prairie pothole lakes (PPLs) are glacially derived, ecologically
   important water bodies found in central North America and represent a
   unique setting in which extensive agriculture occurs within wetland
   ecosystems. In the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), elevated pesticide use
   and increasing hydrologic connectivity have raised concerns about the
   impact of nonpoint source agricultural pollution on the water quality of
   PPLs and downstream aquatic systems. Despite containing high dissolved
   organic matter (DOM) levels, the photoreactivity of the PPL water and
   the photochemical fate of pesticides entering PPLs are largely unknown.
   In this study, the photodegradation of sixteen pesticides was
   investigated in PPL waters sampled from North Dakota, under simulated
   and natural sunlight. Enhanced pesticide removal rates in the irradiated
   PPL water relative to the control buffer pointed to the importance of
   indirect photolysis pathways involving photochemically produced reactive
   intermediates (PPRIs). The steady-state concentrations of carbonate
   radical, hydroxyl radical, singlet oxygen, and triplet-excited state DOM
   were measured and second-order rate constants for reactions of
   pesticides with these PPRIs were calculated. Results from this study
   underscore the role of DOM as photosensitizer in limiting the
   persistence of pesticides in prairie wetlands through photochemical
   reactions.}},

Abstract = {{The phototransformation of triclosan has been a matter of longstanding
   interest due to both its prevalence in the environment and the discovery
   of 2,8-dichlorodibenzodioxin as a photoproduct. In this study,
   photolysis of triclosan resulted in several primary photoproducts
   including the following: 2,8-dichlorodibenzodioxin (4\%),
   4,5'-dichloro-{[}1,1'-biphenyl]-2,2'-diol (10\%),
   5-chloro-2-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenol (0.5\%), and 2,4-dichlorophenol
   (7\%). Trapping studies using d(8)-isopropanol showed deuterium
   incorporation in 5-chloro-2-(4-chlorophenoxy)phenol, providing strong
   evidence for the involvement of organic radicals in this reaction.
   Density functional calculations of the excited states of triclosan
   support the involvement of a radical intermediate in the mechanisms
   responsible for the dioxin, biphenyl, and phenoxyphenol photoproducts.
   The pathways for C-Cl bond cleavage and cyclization reactions are

Abstract = {{Free chlorine reacts with the iodide (I-) present in disinfected waters
   to produce free iodine. Past research has indicated that this

   we examined the reactivity of the phenolic compounds 2,4-dichlorophenol,
   triclosan, and bisphenol A in chlorinated waters containing I-. The free
   iodine mediated reactions were probed as a function of the initial I-
   concentration and the solution pH. Over the pH range of 5.5 to 10 for an
   initial I- concentration of 10 mu M, the observed transformation
   kinetics of 2,4-dichlorophenol were generally 2-15x faster than
   reactions with free chlorine alone, while for triclosan and bisphenol A
   the free iodine mediated transformations were approximate to 3-20x and
   approximate to 230-660x faster, respectively. A comprehensive reaction
   model that simultaneously accounts for free chlorine and free iodine
   reactivity in these systems was developed to determine second order rate
   constants for the chlorinated and iodinated oxidants. For all test
   compounds, iodinated daughter products are rapidly produced when free
   chlorine reacts in the presence of I-.}},

Abstract = {{The properties of complex oxide films depend sensitively on epitaxial
   strain. This strain affects bond lengths and angles, and defect types
   and densities, thus impacting physical properties. In this work we
   perform detailed characterization of depth-dependent strain in epitaxial
   La0.5Sr0.5CoO3-delta (LSCO) films on SrTiO3(001), SrTiO3(110), and
   LaAlO3(001) substrates, combining high resolution x-ray diffraction and
   scanning transmission electron microscopy, in addition to geometric
   phase analysis. We elucidate a fundamental link between strain state and
   O vacancy ordering in LSCO films, where lattice mismatch and
   crystallographic orientation can be used to manipulate the modulation
   vector of the long-range vacancy order, thus providing a new approach to
   tailor the properties of such films. (C) 2013 Author(s).}},

   particles embedded in an infinite isotropic matrix with those for the

Abstract = {{This study concerns the development and preliminary experimental
   verification of a topological sensitivity-based platform for the
   material characterization of tissue anomalies exposed by
   vibroacoustography-type imaging techniques. Vibroacoustography (VA) is a
   high-resolution imaging method that has been applied to the detection of
   pathological changes in soft tissues. Although the data provided by this
   method is related to the mechanical properties of tissue, the
   viscoelastic parameters of the object cannot be estimated by this
   imaging method itself. Topological sensitivity (TS) method is a data
   processing methodology that can be used to estimate the viscoelastic
   parameters of an object from vibration data. In this study, the concept
   of topological sensitivity is applied to interpret the
   vibroacoustography measurements for the purpose of lesion
   characterization. In the proposed approach, the topological sensitivity
   function, which signifies the variation of a given cost functional when
   an infinitesimal inclusion with trial material parameters is placed at
   the location of a point force, is formulated in terms of the adjoint
   field. The effectiveness of the resulting formula as a material
   indicator for lesion characterization is demonstrated by estimating the
   relative elastic parameters of a well-controlled neoprene sphere
   embedded in a tissue-mimicking phantom specimen.}},

Abstract = {{Engineered tissues are commonly stretched or compressed (i.e.,
   conditioned) during culture to stimulate extracellular matrix (ECM)
   production and to improve the mechanical properties of the growing
   construct. The relationships between mechanical stimulation and ECM
   remodeling, however, are complex, interdependent, and dynamic. Thus,
   theoretical models are required for understanding the underlying
   phenomena so that the conditioning process can be optimized to produce
   functional engineered tissues. Here, we continue our development of
   multiscale mechanical models by simulating the effect of cell tractions
   on developing isometric tension and redistributing forces in the
   surrounding fibers of a collagen gel embedded with explants. The model
   predicted patterns of fiber reorganization that were similar to those
   observed experimentally. Furthermore, the inclusion of cell compaction
   also changed the distribution of fiber strains in the gel compared to
   the acellular case, particularly in the regions around the cells where
   the highest strains were found.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In addition to their obvious biological roles in tissue function, cells
   often play a significant mechanical role through a combination of
   passive and active behaviors. This study focused on the passive
   mechanical contribution of cells in tissues by improving our multiscale
   model via the addition of cells, which were treated as dilute spherical
   inclusions. The first set of simulations considered a rigid cell, with
   the surrounding ECM modeled as (1) linear elastic, (2) Neo-Hookean, and
   (3) a fiber network. Comparison with the classical composite theory for
   rigid inclusions showed close agreement at low cell volume fraction. The
   fiber network case exhibited nonlinear stress-strain behavior and
   Poisson's ratios larger than the elastic limit of 0.5, characteristics
   similar to those of biological tissues. The second set of simulations
   used a fiber network for both the cell (simulating cytoskeletal
   filaments) and matrix, and investigated the effect of varying relative
   stiffness between the cell and matrix, as well as the effect of a
   cytoplasmic pressure to enforce incompressibility of the cell. Results
   showed that the ECM network exerted negligible compression on the cell,
   even when the stiffness of fibers in the network was increased relative
   to the cell. Introduction of a cytoplasmic pressure significantly
   increased the stresses in the cell filament network, and altered how the
   cell changed its shape under tension. Findings from this study have
   implications on understanding how cells interact with their surrounding
   ECM, as well as in the context of mechanosensation.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial and temporal heterogeneity of methane flux from boreal wetlands
   makes prediction and up-scaling challenging, both within and among
   wetland systems. Drivers of methane production and emissions are also
   highly variable, making empirical model development difficult and
   leading to uncertainty in methane emissions estimates from wetlands.
   Previous studies have examined this problem using point-scale (static
   chamber method) and ecosystem-scale (flux tower methods) measurements,
   but few studies have investigated whether different processes are
   observed at these scales. We analyzed methane emissions from a boreal
   fen, measured by both techniques, using data from the Boreal
   Ecosystem-Atmosphere Study. We sought to identify driving processes
   associated with methane emissions at two scales and explain diurnal
   patterns in emissions measured by the tower. The mean methane emission
   rates from flux chambers were greater than the daytime, daily mean rates
   measured by the tower, but the nighttime, daily mean emissions from the
   tower were often an order of magnitude greater than emissions recorded
   during the daytime. Thus, daytime measurements from either the tower or
   chambers would lead to a biased estimate of total methane emissions from
   the wetland. We found that the timing of nighttime emission events was
   coincident with the cooling and convective mixing within hollows, which
   occurred regularly during the growing season. We propose that diurnal
   thermal stratification in shallow pools traps methane by limiting
   turbulent transport. This methane stored during daytime heating is later
   released during evening cooling due to convective turbulent mixing.}},

Title = {{Hypervalent surface interactions for colloidal stability and doping of
   silicon nanocrystals}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals have attracted attention for
   cost-effective, solution-based deposition of quantum-confined thin films
   for optoelectronics. However, two significant challenges must be
   addressed before practical nanocrystal-based devices can be realized.
   The first is coping with the ligands that terminate the nanocrystal
   surfaces. Though ligands provide the colloidal stability needed to cast
   thin films from solution, these ligands dramatically hinder charge
   carrier transport in the resulting film. Second, after a conductive film
   is achieved, doping has proven difficult for further control of the
   optoelectronic properties of the film. Here we report the ability to
   confront both of these challenges by exploiting the ability of silicon
   to engage in hypervalent interactions with hard donor molecules. For the
   first time, we demonstrate the significant potential of applying the
   interaction to the nanocrystal surface. In this study, hypervalent
   interactions are shown to provide colloidal stability as well as doping
   of silicon nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Spatiotemporal correlations of spontaneous blood oxygenation level
   dependent (BOLD) signals measured in the resting brain have been found
   to imply many resting-state coherent networks under both awake/conscious
   and anesthetized/unconscious conditions. To understand the resting-state
   brain networks in the unconscious state, spontaneous BOLD signals from
   the rat sensorimotor cortex were studied across a wide range of
   anesthesia levels induced by isoflurane. Distinct resting-state networks
   covering functionally specific sub-regions of the sensorimotor system
   were observed under light anesthesia with 1.0 \% isoflurane; however,
   they gradually merged into a highly synchronized and spatially
   less-specific network under deep anesthesia with 1.8 \% isoflurane. The
   EEG power correlations recorded using three electrodes from a separate
   group of rats showed similar dependency on anesthesia depth, suggesting
   the neural origin of the change in functional connectivity specificity.
   The specific-to-less-specific transition of resting-state networks may
   reflect a functional reorganization of the brain at different anesthesia
   levels or brain states.}},

Abstract = {{Screening genome-wide sets of mutants for fitness defects provides a
   simple but powerful approach for exploring gene function, mapping
   genetic networks and probing mechanisms of drug action. For yeast and
   other microorganisms with global mutant collections, genetic or
   chemical-genetic interactions can be effectively quantified by growing
   an ordered array of strains on agar plates as individual colonies, and
   then scoring the colony size changes in response to a genetic or
   environmental perturbation. To do so, requires efficient tools for the
   extraction and analysis of quantitative data. Here, we describe SGAtools
   (http://sgatools.ccbr.utoronto.ca), a web-based analysis system for
   designer genetic screens. SGAtools outlines a series of guided steps
   that allow the user to quantify colony sizes from images of agar plates,
   correct for systematic biases in the observations and calculate a
   fitness score relative to a control experiment. The data can also be
   visualized online to explore the colony sizes on individual plates, view
   the distribution of resulting scores, highlight genes with the strongest
   signal and perform Gene Ontology enrichment analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are increasingly attracting attention as a
   sustainable technology as they convert chemical energy in organic wastes
   to electricity. In this study, the effects of different inoculum sources
   (river sediment, activated sludge and anaerobic sludge) and electrical
   current stimulation were evaluated using single-chamber air-cathode MFCs
   as model reactors based on performance in enrichment process and
   electrochemical characteristics Of the reactors. The result revealed the
   rapid anodic biofilm development and substrate utilization of the
   anaerobic sludge-inoculated MFC. It was also found that the river
   sediment-inoculated MFC achieved the highest power output of 195 mu W,
   or 98 mW m(-2), due to better developed anodic biofilm confirmed by
   scanning electron microscopy. The current stimulation enhanced the
   anodic biofilm attachment over time, and therefore reduced the MFC
   internal resistance by 27\%, increased the electrical capacitance by
   four folds, and improved the anodic biofilm resilience against substrate
   deprivation. For mature MFCs, a transient application of a negative
   voltage (-3 V) improved the cathode activity and maximum power output by
   37\%. This improvement was due to the bactericidal effect of the
   electrode potential higher than +1.5 V vs. SHE, demonstrating a
   substantial benefit of treating MPG cathode after long-term operation
   using suitable direct electrical current. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   The fast ordering of the L1(0)-FePt film by CIFOM is probably attributed

Abstract = {{Back-Pressure Power Control (BPPC) is a cross-layer network optimization
   policy that uses power control at the physical layer to facilitate
   efficient routing of packets at the network layer. The starting point of
   this paper is that interference cancellation can be judiciously employed
   together with power control to further enhance network throughput.
   Effective cancellation requires that the interfering signal can be
   reliably decoded, implying that power control and interference
   cancellation are tightly coupled. This leads to a joint Back-Pressure
   Power Control and Interference Cancellation (BPPC-IC) problem
   formulation, with the pragmatic constraint that each receiver can cancel
   at most one interfering signal. This problem is shown to be NP-hard, and
   two approximate solutions are proposed based on successive geometric
   programming approximation, and an extended weighted minimum mean squared
   error (WMMSE) reformulation, respectively. A simpler approximation based
   on stochastic exploration of the control space is also considered.
   Simulation results demonstrate that joint optimization of power control
   and interference cancellation pays off, enabling considerably higher
   network throughput, and lower average delay due to reduced backlogs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a practical system identification procedure for
   small, low-cost, fixed-wing unmanned aircraft. Physical size and cost
   restrictions limit the sensing capabilities of these vehicles. The
   procedure is demonstrated on an Ultra Stick 25e, therefore emphasizing a
   minimum complexity approach compatible with a low-cost inertial sensor.
   A linear model, obtained from the generic nonlinear equations of motion
   for aircraft, is used as a basis for system identification. This model
   is populated with results from a first principles analysis to form a
   baseline model. Flight experiments are designed using the baseline model
   and operational constraints to collect informative data. Parameters of
   the linear model are identified by fitting the model to frequency
   responses extracted from the data. The parameters are integrated into
   the nonlinear equations of motion, and both linear and nonlinear models
   are validated in the time domain. Verification of model accuracy is
   extended with a sensitivity and residual analysis.}},

Abstract = {{A method for estimating the airspeed, angle of attack, and sideslip
   without using a conventional, pitot-static air data system is presented.
   The method relies on measurements from Global Positioning System, an
   inertial measurement unit, and a low-fidelity model of the aircraft's
   dynamics, which are fused using two cascaded extended Kalman filters. In
   the cascaded architecture, the first filter uses information from the
   inertial measurement unit and Global Positioning System to estimate the
   aircraft's absolute velocity and attitude. These estimates are used as
   the measurement updates for the second filter in which they are fused
   with the aircraft dynamics model to generate estimates of the airspeed,
   angle of attack and sideslip. Methods for dealing with the time and
   interstate correlation in the measurements coming from the first filter
   are discussed. Simulation and flight-test results of the method are
   presented. Simulation results show that the root mean square error of
   the airspeed estimate is less than 1 m/s. The nominal errors from the
   flight test on airspeed, angle of attack, and sideslip are less than 2.5
   m/s, 2 deg, and 1 deg, respectively. Factors that affect the accuracy,
   including the implication and impact of using a low-fidelity aircraft
   model, are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Tumor hypoxia is an important factor in assessment of both cancer
   progression and cancer treatment efficacy. This has driven a substantial
   effort toward development of imaging modalities that can directly
   measure oxygen distribution and therefore hypoxia in tissue. Although
   several approaches to measure hypoxia exist, direct measurement of
   tissue oxygen through an imaging approach is still an unmet need. To
   address this, we present a new approach based on in vivo application of
   photoacoustic lifetime imaging (PALI) to map the distribution of oxygen
   partial pressure (pO(2)) in tissue. This method utilizes methylene blue,
   a dye widely used in clinical applications, as an oxygen-sensitive
   imaging agent. PALI measurement of oxygen relies upon pO(2)-dependent
   excitation lifetime of the dye. A multimodal imaging system was designed
   and built to achieve ultrasound (US), photoacoustic, and PALI imaging
   within the same system. Nude mice bearing LNCaP xenograft hindlimb
   tumors were used as the target tissue. Hypoxic regions were identified
   within the tumor in a combined US/PALI image. Finally, the statistical
   distributions of pO(2) in tumor, normal, and control tissues were
   compared with measurements by a needle-mounted oxygen probe. A
   statistically significant drop in mean pO(2) was consistently detected
   by both methods in tumors. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

   were used to study the effect of Si/Al ratio on the aromatic yield. The
   maximum yield was achieved at the Si/Al ratio of 80, which provides
   moderate acidity to achieve high aromatic production and reduce coke
   formation simultaneously. Aromatic production increased with the
   incorporation of copper or gallium to HZSM-5. However, other studied
   metals either had no significant influence or led to a lower aromatic
   yield. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the interaction between the internal energy states and the
   dissociation/recombination process for a diatomic molecule is studied in
   detail. In particular, the state-specific recombination and dissociation
   rate constants are derived as a function of internal energy distribution
   and other molecular parameters. As a special case, applying this result
   with specific vibrational energy distributions, we obtain the classic
   Marrone and Treanor models. An information theory approach to obtain the
   initial recombination distribution for any diatomic molecule is also
   presented. The general idea is to incorporate the vibrational and the
   rotational effects in the dissociation and recombination process without
   a full vibrational-rotational state-specific model. The effect of this
   rovibrational coupling is to produce an initial recombination
   distribution that is biased to the high internal energy states. These
   initial recombination distributions are then thermally averaged to
   obtain temperature-dependent expressions for different diatomic
   molecules to characterize the internal energy distribution of
   recombining molecules.}},

Abstract = {{There is wide anecdotal recognition that biological cell viability and
   behavior can vary significantly as a function of the source of
   commercial tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) culture vessels to which
   those cells adhere. However, this marked material dependency is
   typically resolved by selecting and then consistently using the same
   manufacturer's product - following protocol - rather than by
   investigating the material properties that may be responsible for such
   experimental variation. Here, we quantified several physical properties
   of TCPS surfaces obtained from a wide range of commercial sources and
   processing steps, through the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM)-based
   imaging and analysis, goniometry and protein adsorption quantification.
   We identify qualitative differences in surface features, as well as
   quantitative differences in surface roughness and wettability that
   cannot be attributed solely to differences in surface chemistry. We also
   find significant differences in cell morphology and proliferation among
   cells cultured on different TCPS surfaces, and resolve a correlation
   between nanoscale surface roughness and cell proliferation rate for both
   cell types considered. Interestingly, AFM images of living adherent
   cells on these nanotextured surfaces demonstrate direct interactions
   between cellular protrusions and topographically distinct features.
   These results illustrate and quantify the significant differences in
   material surface properties among these ubiquitous materials, allowing
   us to better understand why the dish can make a difference in biological
   experiments. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We consider the distributed uplink resource allocation problem in a
   multi-carrier wireless network with multiple access points (APs). Each
   mobile user can optimize its own transmission rate by selecting a
   suitable AP and by controlling its transmit power. Our objective is to
   devise suitable algorithms by which mobile users can jointly perform
   these tasks in a distributed manner. Our approach relies on a game
   theoretic formulation of the joint power control and AP selection
   problem. In the proposed game, each user is a player with an associated
   strategy containing a discrete variable (the AP selection decision) and
   a continuous vector (the power allocation among multiple channels). We
   provide characterizations of the Nash Equilibrium of the proposed game.
   We present a novel algorithm named Joint Access Point Selection and
   Power Allocation (JASPA) and its various extensions (with different
   update schedules) that allow the users to efficiently optimize their
   rates. Finally, we study the properties of the proposed algorithms as
   well as their performance via extensive simulations.}},

Title = {{Uncoupling the mitochondria facilitates alternans formation in the

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{305}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Alternans of action potential duration (APD) and intracellular calcium
   ({[}Ca2+](i)) transients in the whole heart are thought to be markers of
   increased propensity to ventricular fibrillation during
   ischemia-reperfusion injuries. During ischemia, ATP production is
   affected and the mitochondria become uncoupled, which may affect
   alternans formation in the heart. The aim of our study was to
   investigate the role of mitochondria on the formation of APD and
   {[}Ca2+](i) alternans in the isolated rabbit heart. We performed dual
   voltage and {[}Ca2+](i) optical mapping of isolated rabbit hearts under
   control conditions, global no-flow ischemia (n = 6), and after treatment
   with 50 nM of the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP (n = 6). We investigated
   the formation of alternans of APD, {[}Ca2+](i) amplitude (CaA), and
   {[}Ca2+](i) duration (CaD) under different rates of pacing. We found
   that treatment with FCCP leads to the early occurrence of APD, CaD, and
   CaA alternans; an increase of intraventricular APD but not CaD
   heterogeneity; and significant reduction in conduction velocity compared
   with that of control. Furthermore, we demonstrated that FCCP and global
   ischemia have similar effects on the prolongation of {[}Ca2+](i)
   transients, whereas ischemia induces a significantly larger reduction of
   APD compared with that in FCCP treatment. In conclusion, our results
   demonstrate that uncoupling of mitochondria leads to an earlier
   occurrence of alternans in the heart. Thus, in conditions of
   mitochondrial stress, as seen during myocardial ischemia, uncoupled
   mitochondria may be responsible for the formation of both APD and
   {[}Ca2+](i) alternans in the heart, which in turn creates a substrate
   for ventricular arrhythmias.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we presented the design, fabrication, and testing of a
   new type of stretchable conductor array with embedded nanowires. The
   conductor array could serve as the interconnect for skin-like, conformal
   circuits, which is one of the key components in a stretchable tactile
   sensor for minimally invasive surgery (MIS) devices and robots to
   measure the contact force, where both stretchability and conductivity
   are required. One example of such applications is to measure the contact
   force between a colonoscope and the colonic wall during colonoscopy. The
   proposed conductor array was fabricated by embedding several parallel
   silver-nanowires (AgNWs) strips (one strip is in the dimension of 3 mm
   wide, 360 mm long, and less than 0.01 mm thick) into the surface of a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin film (50 mm wide, 360 mm long 1 mm
   thick). The conductor array was then wrapped around the surface of a
   colonoscope for bending tests. The results from the bending tests have
   demonstrated that the conductor strip has a stable resistance (around 50
   Omega) when the bending radius changes from 150 to 25 mm. Multitime
   bending tests have shown no conductivity change. Moreover, wiping tests
   have shown that the AgNWs/PDMS conductor array could survive external
   damage from its working environment. With the good repeatability and
   unchanged conductivity during stretching, the conductor array developed
   in this paper is applicable to a stretchable tactile sensor.}},

Pages = {{64-70}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A model of parenchymal mechanics is revisited with the objective of
   investigating the differences in parenchymal microstructure that
   underlie the differences in regional compliance that are inferred from
   gas-mixing studies. The stiffness of the elastic line elements that lie
   along the free edges of alveoli and form the boundary of the lumen of
   the alveolar duct is the dominant determinant of parenchymal compliance.
   Differences in alveolar size cause parallel shifts of the
   pressure-volume curve, but have little effect on compliance. However,
   alveolar size also affects the relation between surface tension and
   pressure during the breathing cycle. Thus regional differences in
   alveolar size generate regional differences in surface tension, and
   these drive Marangoni surface flows that equilibrate surface tension
   between neighboring acini. Surface tension relaxation introduces phase
   differences in regional volume oscillations and a dependence of expired
   gas concentration on expired volume. A particular example of different
   parenchymal properties in two neighboring acini is described, and gas
   exchange in this model is calculated. The efficiency of mixing and slope
   of phase III for the model agree well with published data. This model
   constitutes a new hypothesis concerning the origin of phase III.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a controllable electrophoresis allowing a directed
   deposition of negatively charged single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs)
   on an electro-active polymer to fabricate thin-film transducers under an
   electric field excitation. The assembled high-density SWNT networks are
   verified with SEM micrograph and Raman spectroscopy, and the electric
   filed-induced mechanism for electrophoresis of SWNT is investigated
   using electrochemical analysis technique. The dynamic electromechanical
   properties are characterized by a combinative approach of piezoelectric
   excitation and laser vibrometer measurement. A remarkable performance
   enhancement and tunability for such thin-film transducers in both
   resonant frequency and quality factor is demonstrated, compared with
   pure polymer. This observed enhancement can not only be exploited to
   tailor the thin-film transducers for desired electromechanical
   properties, but also create versatile pathways for variety of
   applications including polymeric electronic technologies.}},

Abstract = {{Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are sarcomas of
   Schwann cell lineage origin that occur sporadically or in association
   with the inherited syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1. To identify
   genetic drivers of MPNST development, we used the Sleeping Beauty (SB)
   transposon-based somatic mutagenesis system in mice with somatic loss of
   transformation-related protein p53 (Trp53) function and/or
   overexpression of human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Common
   insertion site (CIS) analysis of 269 neurofibromas and 106 MPNSTs
   identified 695 and 87 sites with a statistically significant number of
   recurrent transposon insertions, respectively. Comparison to human data
   sets identified new and known driver genes for MPNST formation at these
   sites. Pairwise co-occurrence analysis of CIS-associated genes
   identified many cooperating mutations that are enriched in
   Wnt/beta-catenin, PI3K-AKT-mTOR and growth factor receptor signaling
   pathways. Lastly, we identified several new proto-oncogenes, including
   Foxr2 (encoding forkhead box R2), which we functionally validated as a
   proto-oncogene involved in MPNST maintenance.}},

Abstract = {{The focus of this study is the reconstruction of a penetrable obstacle
   in an acoustic medium from the knowledge of incident time-harmonic waves

   of two competing approaches: the method of topological sensitivity and
   that of linear sampling, that have been successfully developed for a
   variety of physical settings (acoustic, electromagnetic, elastodynamic)
   as non-iterative tools for solving the inverse scattering problem. On
   adopting a particular scattering configuration - plane waves impinging
   on a spherical obstacle - that permits analytical treatment as the
   testing platform, a parallel is drawn between the two methods to
   evaluate their relative performance in reconstructing the obstacle from
   the scattered field data. For completeness, the comparison is made by
   considering a range of input parameters in terms of material properties
   of the scatterer, frequency of illuminating waves, and noise in the

Abstract = {{The effects of the subgrid-scale (SGS) scalar interactions on
   nanoparticle nucleation are investigated via a priori analysis of direct
   numerical simulation data. The formation of dibutyl-phthalate (DBP)
   particles via homogeneous nucleation is simulated in a planar wake.
   Classical nucleation theory is used to model particle nucleation and the
   Navier-Stokes equations are coupled with the scalar transport equations
   to provide the fluid, thermal, and chemical fields. The data shows that
   particle nucleation is initially confined to the thin interfacial region
   or shear layers, where molecular diffusion is dominant. As the flow
   becomes turbulent nucleation increases significantly and the rate of
   particle formation increases by several orders of magnitude. To assess
   the effect of SGS scalar interactions on DBP particle nucleation, the
   temperature and mass-fractions are filtered and the resulting quantities
   are used to compute the nucleating particle field. Two filter widths are
   used to obtain varying levels of SGS interactions. Particle size
   distributions are computed to examine the particle fields produced. This
   work shows that the SGS interactions' effect on nucleation has two
   distinct trends. In the proximal region of the wake, the unresolved
   interactions act to decrease particle formation. However, as the flow
   transitions or becomes turbulent the effect of the SGS interactions act
   to increase particle formation. Copyright 2013 American Association for

Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{1659-1673}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to study metrics suitable for assessing
   uncertainty of power spectra when these are based on finite second-order
   statistics. The family of power spectra which is consistent with a given
   range of values for the estimated statistics represents the uncertainty
   set about the ``true{''} power spectrum. Our aim is to quantify the size
   of this uncertainty set using suitable notions of distance, and in
   particular, to compute the diameter of the set since this represents an
   upper bound on the distance between any choice of a nominal element in
   the set and the ``true{''} power spectrum. Since the uncertainty set may
   contain power spectra with lines and discontinuities, it is natural to
   quantify distances in the weak topology-the topology defined by
   continuity of moments. We provide examples of such weakly continuous
   metrics and focus on particular metrics for which we can explicitly
   quantify spectral uncertainty. We then consider certain high resolution
   techniques which utilize filter-banks for preprocessing, and compute
   worst case a priori uncertainty bounds solely on the basis of the filter
   dynamics. This allows the a priori tuning of the filter-banks for
   improved resolution over selected frequency bands.}},

   model with realistic wind sensor models. The performance versus preview
   time characteristics of the H-infinity controllers are in agreement with
   the predictions from the lower fidelity model. Thus, the analytical

Abstract = {{This paper presents the foundations for the analysis and modeling of
   human guidance behavior that is based on the emergent patterns in the
   closed-loop agent-environment dynamics. The central hypothesis is that
   these patterns, which can be explained in terms of invariants inherent
   to the closed-loop dynamics, provide the building blocks for the
   organization of human guidance behavior. The concept of interaction
   patterns is first introduced using a toy example and then detailed
   formally using dynamical system and control principles. This paper then
   demonstrates the existence and significance of interaction patterns in
   human guidance behavior that is based on data collected using guidance
   experiments with a miniature helicopter. The results confirm that human
   guidance behavior indeed exhibits invariances as defined by interaction
   patterns. The trajectories that are associated with each interaction
   pattern are then further decomposed by applying piecewise linear
   identification. The resulting elements are then combined under a
   hierarchical model that provides a natural and formal description of
   human guidance behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Three porous media flow problems, in which the fluid mechanical
   interactions are critical, are studied in a mesoscopic-microscopic
   coupling system. In this system, fluid flow in the pore space is
   explicitly modeled at mesoscopic level by the lattice Boltzmann method,
   the geometrical representation and the mechanical behavior of the solid
   skeleton are modeled at microscopic level by the particulate distinct
   element method (DEM), and the interfacial interaction between the fluid
   and the solids is resolved by an immersed boundary scheme. In the first
   benchmark problem, the well-known and frequently utilized Ergun equation
   is validated in periodic particle and periodic pore models. In the
   second problem, the upward seepage problem is simulated over three
   stages: The settlement of the column of sphere under gravity loading is
   measured to illustrate the accuracy of the DEM scheme; the system is
   solved to hydrostatic state with pore space filled with fluid, showing
   that the buoyancy effect is captured correctly in the
   mesoscopic-microscopic coupling system; then, the flow with constant
   rate is supplied at the bottom of the column; the swelling of the ground
   surface and pore pressure development from the numerical simulation are
   compared with the predictions of the macroscopic consolidation theory.
   In the third problem, the fluid-flow-induced collapse of a sand arch
   inside a perforation cavity is tested to illustrate a more practical
   application of the developed system. Through comparing simulation
   results with analytical solutions, empirical law and physical laboratory
   observations, it is demonstrated that the developed lattice
   Boltzmann-distinct element coupling system is a powerful fundamental
   research tool for investigating hydromechanical physics in porous media
   flow. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{On the elastic analysis of a circular lined tunnel considering the
   delayed installation of the support}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{57-85}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{This paper revisits the problem of excavation of a circular lined tunnel
   in an infinite elastic medium under plane strain conditions, subjected
   to non-uniform stresses, solved by Einstein and Schwartz in their
   article `Simplified Analysis for Tunnel Supports' published in 1979
   (ASCE J Geotech Eng Div, 106-7), and in related publications by Schwartz
   and Einstein. In contrast with the solution by Einstein and Schwartz
   from 1979 which considers that the support is installed at the very same
   time the tunnel is excavated, and also in contrast with related
   publications by Schwartz and Einstein which account for the delayed
   effect of support installation by multiplying the values of loads and
   displacements on the support by a reduction factor (in the same
   expressions from their 1979 article), this paper formulates the problem
   as two separate problems to account for the two-stage excavation
   process. In a first stage, the initial tractions on the periphery of the
   tunnel to be excavated are decreased (or `relaxed') by a factor f(R), to
   account for the presence of the tunnel front, as normally done in
   analysis of two dimensional sections of lined tunnels using commercial
   finite element software. For this first stage, the solution of the field
   quantities (stresses and displacements) in the ground are provided. In a
   second stage the support is installed, and the previously imposed
   tractions on the boundary of tunnel and support are removed, resulting
   in loading and deformation of the support as it interacts with the
   ground. For this second stage, the field quantities in the ground and
   the resulting values of load and displacements on the support are also
   provided. This paper shows that by decreasing the tractions on the
   tunnel periphery in a ratio f(R) of the initial ground stresses before
   the installation of the support (i.e., with 0 <= f(R) <= 1), the
   resulting final loads and displacements on the support are reduced in
   the same ratio f(R), with respect to the corresponding loads and
   displacements computed by Einstein and Schwartz's solution (i.e., when
   considering the case f(R) = 1). This observation confirms the agreement
   of the two-stage procedure followed in this study and the procedure
   followed in publications by Schwartz and Einstein of multiplying the
   values of load and displacements on the support (for the case f(R) = 1)
   by a correction factor to account for the delayed installation of the
   support. The paper also shows that when the stresses and displacements
   in the ground for the first stage are subtracted from the corresponding
   ground stresses and displacements for the second stage (after the
   support is installed), the resulting values of stresses and
   displacements are reduced in exactly the same ratio f(R). All governing
   equations, boundary conditions and steps needed to arrive to a
   dimensionless form of the two-stage analytical solution of Einstein and
   Schwartz problem are presented, including the solutions for stresses and
   displacements in the ground which were not included in publications by
   Einstein and Schwartz. Also, particular forms of the two-stage solution
   are presented, including cases of an infinitely soft support, an
   infinitely rigid support, and uniform initial far-field stresses, which
   are shown to be equivalent to the classical expressions known as Kirsch
   and Lame solutions, respectively.
   Although the outstanding solution by Einstein and Schwartz published in
   1979 is basically correct, Einstein and Schwartz dropped a term in the
   solution for bending moment because its effect is small in most of the
   situations (particularly when the thickness of the support is small
   compared with the radius of the tunnel). Since the two-stage solution
   for bending moment presented in this paper is equivalent to the Einstein
   and Schwartz's solution only when the missing term in their solution is
   included, this paper presents a revised form of the expressions by
   Einstein and Schwartz published in 1979 which include the missing term,
   and it examines what the effect of retaining or dropping the term is.
   Finally a comparison of results obtained with the two-stage analytical
   solution and the finite difference code FLAC3D is presented, together
   with the outline of a computer spreadsheet that implements the two-stage
   analytical solution of this fundamental problem of tunnel ground-support
   interaction analysis. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The observed product distribution in methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH)
   catalysis can be rationalized based on the relative rates of propagation
   of the aromatic- and olefin-based cycles that operate on the zeolite
   catalyst. We report that the ratio of ethene to 2-methylbutane +
   2-methyl-2-butene (ethene/2MB) yield can be used to describe the
   propagation of aromatic and olefin methylation/cracking cycles. The
   co-reaction of C-12-ethene with C-13-dimethyl ether (DME) shows that the
   rate of DME conversion (1.62 mol C (mol Al s)(-1)) is similar to 20
   times faster than ethene conversion (0.08 mol C (mol Al s)(-1)),
   suggesting that ethene can be considered as terminal product for MTH at
   623 K. At iso-conversion conditions at 548 K, propene is co-fed with DME
   to increase propagation of the olefin-based cycle and correspondingly a
   1.7-fold decrease in the ethene/2MB yield is observed. Similarly, the
   co-reaction of toluene with DME increases propagation of the
   aromatic-based cycle and a 2.1-fold increase in the ethene/2MB yield is
   observed. The ethene/2MB yield also increased by a factor of 2 as DME
   conversion increased from 5\% to 62\%, which is consistent with the
   observed concurrent increase in selectivity to ethene and
   methylbenzenes. For the reaction of DME alone, increasing the
   temperature from 548 K to 723 K increases the propagation of the
   olefin-based cycle and a corresponding decrease in the ethene/2MB yield
   from 4.7 to 1.3 is also observed. The ethene/2MB yield varies
   systematically with feed composition, conversion, and temperature,
   showing that this ratio describes the relative propagation of the
   aromatic to olefin methylation/cracking cycles in MTH conversion on
   H-ZSM-5. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We constructed one wild-type xylose reductase (XR) and eight XR variants
   in a recombinant industrial Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain along with
   xylitol dehydrogenase and xylulokinase overexpression. In the current
   study, we found that K270R XR (hereafter referred to as ``XR-1{''})
   appeared to utilize more NADH than NADPH when xylose was the carbon
   source. After 72 h of fermentation, XR-1 produced an ethanol yield of
   0.34 g/g and a xylitol yield of 0.08 g/g from 55 g/L xylose, while it
   gave an ethanol yield of 0.44 g/g and a xylitol yield of 0.04 g/g under
   a mixture of 40 g/L xylose and 40 g/L glucose. Notably, the findings
   presented here suggest that the XR-1 variant produced approximately 76\%
   more ethanol from xylose than the wild-type XR strain. Comparing with
   other widely divergent XR mutations, the XR-1(K270R) exhibited improved
   xylose consumption rate, balanced redox system and increased ethanol
   yield and production rate when engineered into S. cerevisiae, suggesting
   the significance of mutations to the XR gene in xylose utilization. (c)

   were characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron

   the addition of silica suggest the formation of cross-linking. The
   modulus increased from 300 MPa for PVA to 72 GPa for 120 wt.\% silica
   nanoparticle in the blend and the tensile strength increased from 3.5
   MPa to 35 MPa. The modulus estimated using dynamic tests, tensile tests,
   and nanoindentation was comparable and was predicted well using the
   Halpin-Tsai's equation. The nanocomposites were an order of magnitude
   tougher than the pure polymer. Silica based nanocomposite was also found
   to be an excellent template for the deposition of calcium hydroxyapatite
   when immersed in simulated body fluid. The modulus and tensile strength
   of apatite coated silica nanoparticle (120 wt.\%)-PVA composite
   increased to 11 GPa and 65 MPa respectively, close to that of cortical

Abstract = {{Tree index structures are crucial components in data management systems.
   Existing tree index structure are designed with the implicit assumption
   that the underlying external memory storage is the conventional magnetic
   hard disk drives. This assumption is going to be invalid soon, as flash
   memory storage is increasingly adopted as the main storage media in
   mobile devices, digital cameras, embedded sensors, and notebooks. Though
   it is direct and simple to port existing tree index structures on the
   flash memory storage, that direct approach does not consider the unique
   characteristics of flash memory, i.e., slow write operations, and
   erase-before-update property, which would result in a sub optimal
   performance. In this paper, we introduce FAST (i.e., Flash-Aware Search
   Trees) as a generic framework for flash-aware tree index structures.
   FAST distinguishes itself from all previous attempts of flash memory
   indexing in two aspects: (1) FAST is a generic framework that can be
   applied to a wide class of data partitioning tree structures including
   R-tree and its variants, and (2) FAST achieves both efficiency and
   durability of read and write flash operations through memory flushing
   and crash recovery techniques. Extensive experimental results, based on
   an actual implementation of FAST inside the GiST index structure in
   PostgreSQL, show that FAST achieves better performance than its
   competitors.}},

Abstract = {{This work concerns a collision-free fixed-time formation reconfiguration
   control method for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The reconfiguration
   to the new formation in three-dimensional space is specified based on
   the target final states of each UAV. A reference reconfiguration
   trajectory is generated from a Bolza optimization solution of simplified
   dynamics of the vehicle. A sliding controller is then utilized to track
   the reconfiguration trajectory. Collision avoidance is achieved by
   modeling the detection region of each UAV as a potential field. Such a
   field generates control signals that are inversely proportional to the
   square of the distance between the UAV and a moving or stationary object
   within its detection region. Altered optimal trajectories are generated
   online as the UAV avoids collision with another UAV or other obstacles.
   Simulations confirm that the control scheme developed is able to produce
   satisfactory results. This paper examines the stability (in the sense of
   Lyapunov) and performance of the controller under the influence of the
   avoidance control command. The results of this study provide useful
   insights to the behavior of the UAV formation under tracking command and
   a collision avoidance system.}},

Abstract = {{Secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure continues to be a problem in bars and
   restaurants where smoking is permitted. This study measures the relative
   SHS exposure reduction in nonsmoking sections of establishments that
   allow some smoking.
   Measurements were conducted simultaneously in the smoking and nonsmoking
   sections of 14 Minnesota hospitality venues. All of the 16 two-hr visits
   included photometer measurements of fine particles (PM2.5) and 12 of the
   visits also included measurements of 4 gas-phase tracers of SHS.
   The median ratio of nonsmoking/smoking section PM2.5 concentrations was
   0.65 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 0.490.72. Measurements
   conducted after implementation of a smoking ban at 13 of the venues
   resulted in a smoking section PM2.5 post-ban/pre-ban ratio of 0.06 (IQR
   0.020.16). The median nonsmoking/smoking section ratios for gas-phase
   compound were 0.67 (IQR 0.350.78) for pyridine, 0.52 (IQR 0.300.70) for
   pyrrole, 0.43 (IQR 0.350.84) for 3-EP, and 0.27 (IQR 0.160.47) for
   nicotine. These results are consistent with the expectations of
   differential removal: the lowest ratios are for the least volatile, most
   strongly sorbing gases and the highest ratios for less sorbing gases and
   PM2.5.
   Designated nonsmoking sections in establishments that allow some smoking
   resulted in a median PM2.5 reduction of 35\% compared with a 94\%
   reduction after a smoking ban. The only adequate protection from
   cigarette smoke exposure is to eliminate smoking in indoor spaces.}},

Abstract = {{The feasibility of determining the creep compliance of asphalt concrete

   analyses were performed to understand the stress state in the SCB, and
   an optimal load range producing appreciable displacement measurements
   while preserving the linear viscoelastic conditions was identified.
   Expressions that relate displacement measurements, from particular
   regions of the SCB specimen, to creep function were derived. The
   validity of the proposed SCB creep method was tested both by numerical

Abstract = {{The minimum film formation temperature (MFFT) is the minimum drying
   temperature needed for a latex coating to coalesce into an optically

   microscopy (cryoSEM) was used to track the latex particle deformation
   and water migration in coatings dried at temperatures just above and
   below the MFFT. Although the latex particles completely coalesced at
   both temperatures by the end of the drying process, it was discovered
   that particle deformation during the early drying stages was drastically
   different. Below the MFFT, cracks initiated just as menisci began to
   recede into the packing of consolidated particles, whereas above the
   MFFT, partial particle deformation occurred before menisci entered the
   coating and cracks were not observed. The spacing between cracks
   measured in coatings dried at varying temperatures decreased with
   decreasing drying temperature near the MFFT, whereas it was independent
   of temperature below a critical temperature. Finally, the addition of
   small amounts of silica aggregates was found to lessen the cracking of
   latex coatings near the MFFT without adversely affecting their optical

Abstract = {{Reverse roll coating in which a thin single layer of liquid is applied
   onto a substrate has been used in industry for decades and has been
   extensively analyzed in the literature. Modern coatings, however, are
   often composed of more than one layer to improve the product performance
   and to reduce the manufacturing cost. Premetered methods such as slot,
   slide, and curtain coatings are typically used to produce such
   multilayer coatings. If the caliper of the substrate to be coated is not
   constant, then the coating gap and consequently the final film thickness
   deposited on the web will also be nonuniform. In this study, we focused
   on the use of reverse roll technique with slot die liquid delivery
   system to produce a uniform thin two-layer coating. The use of this
   coating technique to produce such a coating has not been previously
   explored. The liquid film surface as it is transferred from a rigid
   steel roll to a deformable urethane-covered roll was visualized to find
   out how the uniformity of the two-layer coating is affected by the speed
   ratio between two rolls, layers' wet thicknesses, and liquid
   viscosities. The effect of these parameters on the ribbing frequency and
   amplitude was also investigated. The results show that in the two-layer
   coating, as in the single layer reverse transfer, there is a critical
   web speed above which ribbing occurs. The critical speed is determined
   by the bottom layer viscosity.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the problem of energy-efficient, time-constrained path
   planning of a solar-powered robot embedded in a terrestrial environment.
   Because of the effects of changing weather conditions, as well as
   sensing concerns in complex environments, a new method for solar power
   prediction is desirable. We present a method that uses Gaussian Process
   regression to build a solar map in a data-driven fashion. Using this map
   and an empirical model for energy consumption, we perform dynamic
   programming to find energy-minimal paths. We validate our map
   construction and path-planning algorithms with outdoor experiments, and
   we perform simulations on our solar maps to further determine the limits
   of our approach. Our results show that we can effectively construct a
   solar map using only a simple current measurement circuit and basic GPS
   localization, and this solar map can be used for energy-efficient
   navigation. This establishes informed solar harvesting as a viable
   option for extending system lifetime even in complex environments with
   low-cost commercial solar panels. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Dynamic modelling of sea-surface roughness for large-eddy simulation of
   wind over ocean wavefield}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{726}},
Pages = {{62-99}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Wind blowing over the ocean surface can be treated as a turbulent
   boundary layer over a multiscale rough surface with moving roughness
   elements, the waves. Large-eddy simulation (LES) of such flows is
   challenging because LES resolves wind-wave interactions only down to the
   grid scale, Delta, while the effects of subgrid-scale (SGS) waves on the
   wind need to be modelled. Usually, a surface-layer model based on the
   law of the wall is used; but the surface roughness has been known to
   depend on the local wind and wave conditions and is difficult to
   parameterize. In this study, a dynamic model for the SGS sea-surface
   roughness is developed, with the roughness corresponding to the SGS
   waves expressed as alpha(w)sigma(Delta)(eta). Here, sigma(Delta)(eta) is
   the effective amplitude of the SGS waves, modelled as a weighted
   integral of the SGS wave spectrum based on the geometric and kinematic
   properties of the waves for which five candidate expressions are
   examined. Moreover, alpha(w) is an unknown dimensionless model
   coefficient determined dynamically based on the first-principles
   constraint that the total surface drag force or average surface stress
   must be independent of the LES filter scale Delta. The feasibility and
   consistency of the dynamic sea-surface roughness models are assessed by
   a priori tests using data from high-resolution LES with near-surface
   resolution, appropriately filtered. Also, these data are used for a
   posteriori tests of the dynamic sea-surface roughness models in LES with
   near-surface modelling. It is found that the dynamic modelling approach
   can successfully capture the effects of SGS waves on the wind turbulence
   without ad hoc prescription of the model parameter alpha(w). Also, for
   sigma(Delta)(eta), a model based on the kinematics of wind-wave relative
   motion achieves the best performance among the five candidate models.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fractures that grow at shallow depth or, more generally, near
   a free surface, curve towards the surface to become saucer-shaped. These
   saucer-shaped hydraulic fractures pose challenges for modeling that
   include the need to track the evolution of the crack path and to follow
   two distinct moving boundaries corresponding to the leading edge of the
   crack and the fluid front. Results from a coupled, implicit time
   stepping numerical model agree well with detailed laboratory
   experimental data for fluid-driven cracks in glass and PMMA.
   Specifically, the model and laboratory results show good agreement for
   the crack path, the evolution of the fluid and fracture fronts, the
   crack opening, and the injection fluid pressure. This strong comparison
   not only demonstrates the viability of the numerical model, but more
   generally the results demonstrate that considering coupling among fluid
   flow, elastic deformation, and radially symmetric crack growth captures
   enough of the relevant physical processes to accurately predict the
   leading order behavior of the physical system realized in the laboratory
   using homogeneous brittle-elastic solids. Crown Copyright (C) 2013

Title = {{A geometry factor for natural convection in open cell metal foam}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{62}},
Pages = {{697-710}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A dimensionless geometry factor, defined as the ratio of the product of
   the microscopic length scale and the solid fluid interface area to the
   solid volume in a representative elementary volume (REV), connects the
   macroscopic and microscopic drag and heat flux between the solid and
   fluid phases in a porous medium. Unlike the conventional porosity based
   geometry factor (1-porosity), the geometry factor represents how widely
   the solid is distributed in the REV. Based on this geometry factor, the
   microscopic drag coefficients and heat transfer correlations are
   presented in a uniform form for porous media of arbitrary microscopic
   geometry, such as spheres, tubes, and metal foams. Also relationships
   between the microscopic drag coefficients and permeability, Forcheimer
   coefficient, and Ergun constants are obtained based on the geometry
   factor. Numerical simulations based on this model agree with previous
   studies on sphere packed spheres, tube bundle heat exchangers, and
   natural convection in saturated metal foams including a metal foam with
   a superposed fluid layer. The effects of Rayleigh number, geometry
   factor, and ratio of macroscopic to microscopic length scale on overall
   heat transfer in natural convection in a saturated metal foam are
   presented. Transient isotherms and streamlines provide a full map of the
   overall Nusselt number versus Rayleigh number relation and show the
   relation between the oscillation of Nusselt number and the shedding of
   the thermal plumes at large Rayleigh number. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   by an animated anatomic left ventricle}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{244}},
Pages = {{41-62}},
Month = {{JUL 1}},
Abstract = {{We develop a novel large-scale kinematic model for animating the left
   ventricle (LV) wall and use this model to drive the fluid-structure
   interaction (FSI) between the ensuing blood flow and a mechanical heart
   valve prosthesis implanted in the aortic position of an anatomic
   LV/aorta configuration. The kinematic model is of lumped type and
   employs a cell-based, FitzHugh-Nagumo framework to simulate the motion
   of the LV wall in response to an excitation wavefront propagating along
   the heart wall. The emerging large-scale LV wall motion exhibits complex
   contractile mechanisms that include contraction (twist) and expansion
   (untwist). The kinematic model is shown to yield global LV motion
   parameters that are well within the physiologic range throughout the
   cardiac cycle. The FSI between the leaflets of the mechanical heart
   valve and the blood flow driven by the dynamic LV wall motion and mitral
   inflow is simulated using the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB)
   method (Ge and Sotiropoulos, 2007; Borazjani et al., 2008) {[}1,2]
   implemented in conjunction with a domain decomposition approach. The
   computed results show that the simulated flow patterns are in good
   qualitative agreement with in vivo observations. The simulations also
   reveal complex kinematics of the valve leaflets, thus, underscoring the
   need for patient-specific simulations of heart valve prosthesis and
   other cardiac devices. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An effective semi-continuous process was developed to grow a locally

   wastewater in bench scale for improved algal biomass production and
   waste nutrient removal using central composite design (CCD). The
   influences of two key parameters, namely wastewater dilution rate (DR)
   and hydraulic retention time (HRT), on algal biomass productivity and
   nutrient removal rates were investigated. The optimal parameters
   estimated from the significant second-order quadratic models (p < 0.05)
   were 8-fold DR and 2.26-d HRT. The cultivating experiment in a
   bench-scale multi-layer photobioreactor with the optimized conditions
   achieved stable algal productivity and nutrient removal rates, which
   fitted the predictive models well. Moreover, relatively high and stable
   protein and lipid contents (58.78\% and 26.09\% of the dry weight,
   respectively) were observed for the collected algae sample, indicating
   the suitability of the algal biomass as ideal feedstock for both biofuel

Abstract = {{Comparisons of properties are made for pressure-sensitive adhesives
   (PSAs) generated via emulsion polymerization using both conventional and
   reactive emulsifiers The emulsifiers are ammonium salts of sulfated
   nonylphenol ethoxylates with similar chemical structures and hydrophilic
   lipophilic balances. The polymerizable surfactant possesses a reactive
   double bond at its phenyl ring allowing for participation in free
   radical polymerization reactions. Incorporation of the polymerizable
   surfactant into the adhesive polymer was confirmed via reverse-phase
   liquid chromatography. Surfactant distributions in PSA films were
   characterized using confocal Raman microscopy and contact angle
   measurements. Increasing conventional surfactant concentrations in
   emulsion polymerization, reactions resulted in proportional increases in
   concentrations at the surfaces of latex-cast films. No surface
   enrichment of adhesive films was observed when reactive emulsifiers were
   employed. Variations in measured depth profiles and contact angles are
   consistent with observed performance properties, for example, tack, peel
   strength, and shear times. Increasing concentrations of conventional
   surfactants decreased adhesive performance, while adhesives generated
   with polymerizable surfactants showed little or no such decreases in
   film performance properties. It is concluded that the polymerizable
   surfactant is bound in the adhesive in such a way that its migration to
   film surfaces during drying and formation is inhibited, preventing
   degradation of adhesive performance.}},

Abstract = {{Enabled by the technique of objective molecular dynamics, we reveal the
   unusual mechanics exhibited by nanoscale twisted graphene nanoribbons
   containing up to seven layers. Unlike in a linear-elastic plate, we find
   that the deformation practically does not contain contributions
   associated with in-plane shearing but largely with inhomogeneous
   stretching and compression of the constituent layers. The whole twisted
   structure undergoes shortening when no axial force is applied, while the
   constituent layers store various strain energies, depending on their
   location. We capture this behavior with a simple model and show that the
   deviations from the plate model are increasing with the number of layers
   and width of the ribbon. Our results are especially relevant for the
   experimental efforts of measuring graphene's shear modulus.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{441}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{APOBEC3B is one of seven human APOBEO DNA cytosine deaminases that
   function to inhibit the replication and persistence of retroelements and
   retroviruses. Human APOBEC3B restricts the replication of HIV-1 in
   HEK293 cells, while our laboratory clone of rhesus macaque APOBEC3B did
   not. We mapped the restriction determinant to a single amino acid
   difference that alters enzymatic activity. Human APOBEOB D316 is
   catalytically active and capable of restricting HIV-1 while rhesus
   APOBEC3B N316 is not: swapping these residues alters the activity and
   restriction phenotypes respectively. Genotyping of primate center rhesus
   macaques revealed uniform homozygosity for aspartate at position 316.
   Considering the C-to-T nature of the underlying mutation, we suspect
   that our rhesus APOBEC3B cDNA was inactivated by its own gene product
   during subcloning in Escherichia coli. This region has been previously
   characterized for its role in substrate specificity, but these data
   indicate it also has a fundamental role in deaminase activity. (C) 2013

Title = {{Unligated Okazaki Fragments Induce PCNA Ubiquitination and a Requirement
   for Rad59-Dependent Replication Fork Progression}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 18}},
Abstract = {{Deficiency in DNA ligase I, encoded by CDC9 in budding yeast, leads to
   the accumulation of unligated Okazaki fragments and triggers PCNA
   ubiquitination at a non-canonical lysine residue. This signal is crucial
   to activate the S phase checkpoint, which promotes cell cycle delay. We
   report here that a pol30-K107 mutation alleviated cell cycle delay in
   cdc9 mutants, consistent with the idea that the modification of PCNA at
   K107 affects the rate of DNA synthesis at replication forks. To
   determine whether PCNA ubiquitination occurred in response to nicks or
   was triggered by the lack of PCNA-DNA ligase interaction, we
   complemented cdc9 cells with either wild-type DNA ligase I or a mutant
   form, which fails to interact with PCNA. Both enzymes reversed PCNA
   ubiquitination, arguing that the modification is likely an integral part
   of a novel nick-sensory mechanism and not due to non-specific secondary
   mutations that could have occurred spontaneously in cdc9 mutants. To
   further understand how cells cope with the accumulation of nicks during
   DNA replication, we utilized cdc9-1 in a genome-wide synthetic lethality
   screen, which identified RAD59 as a strong negative interactor. In
   comparison to cdc9 single mutants, cdc9 rad59D double mutants did not
   alter PCNA ubiquitination but enhanced phosphorylation of the mediator
   of the replication checkpoint, Mrc1. Since Mrc1 resides at the
   replication fork and is phosphorylated in response to fork stalling,
   these results indicate that Rad59 alleviates nick-induced replication
   fork slowdown. Thus, we propose that Rad59 promotes fork progression
   when Okazaki fragment processing is compromised and counteracts
   PCNA-K107 mediated cell cycle arrest.}},

   formed by two facing In0.53Ga0.47As surfaces, with areas of tens of
   microns, was controlled by a wedge electrostatic actuator. Upon

Abstract = {{APOBEC3A (A3A) is a myeloid lineage-specific DNA cytosine deaminase with
   a role in innate immunity to foreign DNA. Previous studies have shown
   that heterologously expressed A3A is genotoxic, suggesting that
   monocytes may have a mechanism to regulate this enzyme. Indeed, we
   observed no significant cytotoxicity when interferon was used to induce
   the expression of endogenous A3A in CD14(+)-enriched primary cells or
   the monocytic cell line THP-1. In contrast, doxycycline-induced A3A in
   HEK293 cells caused major cytotoxicity at protein levels lower than
   those observed when CD14(+) cells were stimulated with interferon.
   Immunofluorescent microscopy of interferon-stimulated CD14(+) and THP-1
   cells revealed that endogenous A3A is cytoplasmic, in stark contrast to
   stably or transiently transfected A3A, which has a cell-wide
   localization. A3A constructs engineered to be cytoplasmic are also
   nontoxic in HEK293 cells. These data combine to suggest that monocytic
   cells use a cytoplasmic retention mechanism to control A3A and avert
   genotoxicity during innate immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to precisely control the topography, roughness, and chemical
   properties of metallic nanostructures is crucial for applications in
   plasmonics, nanofluidics, electronics, and biosensing. Here a simple
   method to produce embedded nanoplasmonic devices that can generate
   tunable plasmonic fields on ultraflat surfaces is demonstrated. Using a
   template-stripping technique, isolated metallic nanodisks and wires are
   embedded in optical epoxy, which is capped with a thin silica overlayer
   using atomic layer deposition. The top silica surface is topographically
   flat and laterally homogeneous, providing a uniform, high-quality
   biocompatible substrate, while the nanoplasmonic architecture hidden
   underneath creates a tunable plasmonic landscape for optical imaging and
   sensing. The localized surface plasmon resonance of gold nanodisks
   embedded underneath flat silica films is used for real-time kinetic
   sensing of the formation of a supported lipid bilayer and subsequent
   receptor-ligand binding. Gold nanodisks can also be embedded in
   elastomeric materials, which can be peeled off the substrate to create
   flexible plasmonic membranes that conform to non-planar surfaces.}},

Title = {{Optimization of Aerosol Jet Printing for High-Resolution, High-Aspect

Abstract = {{Aerosol jet printing requires control of a number of process parameters,
   including the flow rate of the carrier gas that transports the aerosol
   mist to the substrate, the flow rate of the sheath gas that collimates
   the aerosol into a narrow beam, and the speed of the stage that
   transports the substrate beneath the beam. In this paper, the influence
   of process parameters on the geometry of aerosol-jet-printed silver
   lines is studied with the aim of creating high-resolution conductive
   lines of high current carrying capacity. A systematic study of process
   conditions revealed a key parameter: the ratio of the sheath gas flow
   rate to the carrier gas flow rate, defined here as the focusing ratio.
   Line width decreases with increasing the focusing ratio and stage speed.
   Simultaneously, the thickness increases with increasing the focusing
   ratio but decreases with increasing stage speed. Geometry control also
   influences the resistance per unit length and single pass printing of
   low-resistance silver lines is demonstrated. The results are used to
   develop an operability window and locate the regime for printing tall
   and narrow silver lines in a single pass. Under optimum conditions,
   lines as narrow as 20 mu m with aspect ratios (thickness/width) greater
   than 0.1 are obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafiltration membranes with an 80 nm thick block polymer derived

   removing poly(lactide) (PLA) from a

   microporous polymer support. The block polymer film adopted a
   core(PLA)-shell(PI) cylindrical morphology in which vertically-oriented
   PLA cylinders were degraded to leave PI-lined channels in a PS matrix.
   Thanks to the combination of PS and PI in the nanoporous matrix,
   chemical cross-linking was not needed et to provide mechanical stability
   in the thin film. The membranes showed a hydraulic flux of 165 L m(-2)
   h(-1) bar(-1) and were able to size discriminate poly(ethylene oxide)

Abstract = {{We report a synthetic method for the preparation of well-defined

   combination of living anionic polymerization and urethane based
   polycondensation along with an assessment of the associated microphase
   morphology and thermal and mechanical properties. The prepolymers,
   alpha,omega-dihydroxy polystyrene (HO-PS-OH) and alpha,omega-dihydroxy
   polybutadiene (HO-PB-OH), were prepared using a protected initiator,
   followed by deprotection and condensation with isophorone diisocyanate
   (IPDI) leading to the (PS-PB)(n) multiblock copolymers. Two types of
   block sequences were generated, one with random block sequences
   (PS-ran-PB)(n) and the second with alternating (PS-ran-PB)(n) block
   architectures. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC), H-1 nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR), and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (FTIR)
   confirmed that the synthetic procedures yielded the desired products.
   Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed microphase separation
   and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) demonstrated that the multiblock materials, containing
   between 69\% and 85\% by volume glassy PS, are characterized by a
   disordered bicontinuous-like morphology. Tensile tests demonstrated
   yielding followed by necking and an overall ductility that translates
   into much greater toughness than that typically found in glassy
   continuous SBS triblock copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{As radio frequency (RF) catheter ablation becomes increasingly prevalent
   in the management of ventricular arrhythmia in patients, an accurate and
   rapid determination of the arrhythmogenic site is of important clinical
   interest. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that the
   inversely reconstructed ventricular endocardial current density
   distribution from body surface potential maps (BSPMs) can localize the
   regions critical for maintenance of a ventricular ectopic activity.
   Patients with isolated and monomorphic premature ventricular
   contractions (PVCs) were investigated by noninvasive BSPMs and
   subsequent invasive catheter mapping and ablation. Equivalent current
   density (CD) reconstruction (CDR) during symptomatic PVCs was obtained
   on the endocardial ventricular surface in six patients (four men, two
   women, years 23-77), and the origin of the spontaneous ectopic activity
   was localized at the location of the maximum CD value. Compared with the
   last (successful) ablation site (LAS), the mean and standard deviation
   of localization error of the CDR approach were 13.8 and 1.3 mm,
   respectively. In comparison, the distance between the LASs and the
   estimated locations of an equivalent single moving dipole in the heart
   was 25.5 +/- 5.5 mm. The obtained CD distribution of activated sources
   extending from the catheter ablation site also showed a high consistency
   with the invasively recorded electroanatomical maps. The noninvasively
   reconstructed endocardial CD distribution is suitable to predict a
   region of interest containing or close to arrhythmia source, which may
   have the potential to guide RF catheter ablation.}},

Abstract = {{We have performed a comprehensive study of chemical synthesis, crystal
   growth, crystal quality, and electrical transport properties of
   isotopically substituted rubrene-d(28) single crystals (D-rubrene,
   C42D28). Using a modified synthetic route for protonated-rubrene
   (H-rubrene, C42H28), we have obtained multigram quantities of rubrene
   with deuterium incorporation approaching 100\%. We found that the
   vapor-grown D-rubrene single crystals, whose high qualities were
   confirmed by X-ray diffraction and atomic force microscopy, maintained
   the remarkable transport properties originally manifested by H-rubrene
   crystals. Specifically, field-effect hole mobility 1 above 10 cm(2) V-1
   s(-1) was consistently achieved in the vacuum-gap transistor
   architecture at room temperature, with an intrinsic band-like transport
   behavior observed over a broad temperature range; maximum hole mobility
   reached 45 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) near 100 K. Theoretical analysis provided
   estimates of the density and characteristic energy of shallow and deep
   traps presented in D-rubrene crystals. Overall, the successful synthesis
   and characterization of rubrene-d(28) paves an important pathway for
   future spin-transport experiments in which the H/D isotope effect on
   spin lifetime can be examined in the testbed of rubrene.}},

Abstract = {{There are many potential sensing applications for Au nanorods due to a
   tunable localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) frequency that
   changes with aspect ratio. However, their application at high
   temperatures is limited due to a shape change that can take place well
   below the melting point of bulk Au, driven by a reduction in surface
   energy. A method of stabilizing Au nanorods is provided here by
   encapsulating them with a 15 nm capping layer of yttria stabilized
   zirconia (YSZ). After annealing rods with nominal dimensions of 100 x 44
   nm to a temperature of 600 degrees C, small reductions in length were
   observed; but the rods remained stable for all subsequent sensing tests
   at 500 degrees C, which amounted to 80 h. It was shown with a separate
   sample that the rod geometry can be preserved even up to 800 degrees C
   over a 12 h annealing period, although a significant shortening of the
   rod length occurred, leaving a void space in the YSZ. The sensing
   response of both the transverse and the longitudinal LSPR peaks was
   monitored for H-2, CO, and NO2 exposures in an air background at 500
   degrees C. In all cases, the longitudinal LSPR peak shows a larger shift
   upon gas exposure than does the transverse peak.}},

Title = {{Using arc voltage to locate the anode attachment in plasma arc cutting}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{22, SI}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Plasma arc cutting is a widely used industrial process in which an
   electric arc in the form of a high velocity plasma jet is used to melt
   and blow away metal. The arc attaches inside the resulting cut slot, or
   kerf, where it both provides a large heat flux and determines the flow
   dynamics of the plasma. Knowledge of the position of the arc attachment
   is essential for understanding the phenomena present at the work piece.
   This work presents a new method of measuring the location of the arc
   attachment in which the arc voltage is measured during the cutting of a
   range of work piece thicknesses. The attachment location is then
   interpreted from the voltages. To support the validity of this method,
   the kerf shape, dross particle size and dross adhesion to the work piece
   are also observed. While these do not conclusively give an attachment
   location, they show patterns which are consistent with the attachment
   location found from the voltage measurements. The method is demonstrated
   on the cutting of mild steel, where the arc attachment is found to be
   stationary in the upper portion of the cut slot and in reasonable
   agreement with existing published findings. For a process optimized for
   the cutting of 12.7mm mild steel, the attachment is found at a depth of
   1.5-3.4 mm. For a slower process optimized for the cutting of 25.4mm
   mild steel, the attachment is found at a depth of 3.4-4.8 mm, which
   enhances heat transfer further down in the kerf, allowing cutting of the
   thicker work piece. The use of arc voltage to locate the position of the
   arc attachment is unique when compared with existing methods because it
   is entirely independent of the heat distribution and visualization
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{The relationship between polyol adsorption affinity and silanol defect
   density was investigated through the development of vapor and aqueous
   adsorption isotherms on silicalite-1 materials which vary in structural
   and surface properties. Silicalite-1 crystals prepared through alkaline
   synthesis, alkaline synthesis with steaming post-treatment, and fluoride
   synthesis routes were confirmed as crystalline mordenite framework
   inverted (MFI) by SEM and XRD and were shown to contain similar to 8.50
   silanol defects per unit cell by Si-29 MAS, H-1 MAS, and (HSi)-H-1-Si-29
   CPMAS NMR. A hysteresis in the Ar 87 K adsorption isotherm at 10(3)
   P/P-0 evolved with a decrease in silanol defects, and, through features
   in the XRD and Si-29 MAS NMR spectra, it is postulated that the
   hysteresis is the result of an orthorhombicmonoclinic symmetry shift
   with decreasing silanol defect density. Gravimetric and aqueous solution
   measurements reveal that propylene glycol adsorption at 333 K is
   promoted by silanol defects, with a maximum 20-fold increase observed
   for aqueous adsorption at similar to 10(-3) g/mL with an increase from
   similar to 0 to 8.5 silanols per unit cell. A comparison of vapor and
   aqueous propylene glycol adsorption isotherms on defect-free siicalite-1
   at 333 K, both of which exhibit the Type-V character, indicates that
   water. enhances adsorption by a factor of similar to 2 in the Henry's
   Law regime. Henry's constants for aqueous C-2-C-4 polyol adsorption
   (concentrations below 0.004 g/mL) at 298 K are shown to have a linear
   dependence on the silanol defect density, demonstrating that these
   molecules preferentially adsorb at silanol defects at dilute
   concentrations. This systematic study of polyol adsorption on
   silicalite-1 materials highlights the critical role of defects on
   adsorption of hydrophilic molecules and clearly details the effects of
   coadsorption of water, which can guide the selection of zeolites for
   separation of biomass-derived oxygenates.}},

Title = {{Thermal Processing of Biological Tissue at High Temperatures: Impact of
   Protein Denaturation and Water Loss on the Thermal Properties of Human
   and Porcine Liver in the Range 25-80 degrees C}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Biothermal engineering applications impose thermal excursions on tissues
   with an ensuing biological outcome (i.e., life or death) that is tied to
   the molecular state of water and protein in the system. The accuracy of
   heat transfer models used to predict these important processes in turn
   depends on the kinetics and energy absorption of molecular transitions
   for both water and protein and the underlying temperature dependence of
   the tissue thermal properties. Unfortunately, a lack of tissue thermal
   property data in the literature results in an overreliance on property
   estimates. This work addresses these thermal property limitations in
   liver, a platform tissue upon which hyperthermic engineering
   applications are routinely performed and a test bed that will allow
   extension to further tissue property measurement in the future.
   Specifically, we report on the thermal properties of cadaveric human and
   porcine liver in the suprazero range between 25 degrees C to 80 degrees
   C for thermal conductivity and 25 degrees C to 85 degrees C for apparent
   specific heat. Denaturation and water vaporization are shown to reduce
   thermal conductivity and apparent specific heat within the samples by up
   to 20\% during heating. These changes in thermal properties
   significantly altered thermal histories during heating compared to
   conditions when properties were assumed to remain constant. These
   differences are expected to alter the biological outcome from heating as
   well.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Assessment of the Overall Heat Transfer Coefficient U}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEAT TRANSFER-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{6, SI}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This investigation was performed in order to quantify the validity of
   the assumed constancy of the overall heat transfer coefficient U in heat
   exchanger design. The prototypical two-fluid heat exchanger, the
   double-pipe configuration, was selected for study. Heat transfer rates
   based on the U constant model were compared with those from highly
   accurate numerical simulations for 60 different operating conditions.
   These conditions included: (a) parallel and counter flow, (b) turbulent
   flow in both the pipe and the annulus, (c) turbulent flow in the pipe
   and laminar flow in the annulus and the vice versa situation, (d)
   laminar flow in both the pipe and the annulus, and (e) different heat
   exchanger lengths. For increased generality, these categories were
   further broken down into matched and unmatched Reynolds numbers in the
   individual flow passages. The numerical simulations eschewed the
   unrealistic uniform-inlet-velocity-profile model by focusing on
   pressure-driven flows. The largest errors attributable to the U constant
   model were encountered for laminar flow in both the pipe and the annulus
   and for laminar flow in one of these passages and turbulent flow in the
   other passage. This finding is relevant to microchannel flows and other
   low-speed flow scenarios. Errors as large as 50\% occurred. The least
   impacted were cases in which the flow is turbulent in both the pipe and
   the annulus. The general level of the errors due to the U constant model
   were on the order of 10\% and less for those cases. This outcome is of
   great practical importance because heat-exchanger flows are more
   commonly turbulent than laminar. Another significant outcome of this
   investigation is the quantification of the axial variations of the
   temperature and heat flux along the wall separating the pipe and annulus
   flows. It is noteworthy that these distributions do not fit either the
   uniform wall temperature or uniform heat flux models.}},

Abstract = {{In bacteria, chromosomal architecture shows strong spatial and temporal
   organization, and regulates key cellular functions, such as
   transcription. Tracking the motion of chromosomal loci at short
   timescales provides information related to both the physical state of
   the nucleo-protein complex and its local environment, independent of
   large-scale motions related to genome segregation. Here we investigate
   the short-time (0.1-10 s) dynamics of fluorescently labelled chromosomal
   loci in Escherichia coli at different growth rates. At these timescales,
   we observe for the first time a dependence of the loci's apparent
   diffusion on both their subcellular localization and chromosomal
   coordinate, and we provide evidence that the properties of the
   chromosome are similar in the tested growth conditions. Our results
   indicate that either non-equilibrium fluctuations due to enzyme activity
   or the organization of the genome as a polymer-protein complex vary as a
   function of the distance from the origin of replication.}},

Title = {{Canonical Wnt/beta-catenin Signaling Drives Human Schwann Cell
   Transformation, Progression, and Tumor Maintenance}},

Abstract = {{Genetic changes required for the formation and progression of human
   Schwann cell tumors remain elusive. Using a Sleeping Beauty forward
   genetic screen, we identified several genes involved in canonical Wnt
   signaling as potential drivers of benign neurofibromas and malignant
   peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs). In human neurofibromas and
   MPNSTs, activation of Wnt signaling increased with tumor grade and was
   associated with downregulation of beta-catenin destruction complex
   members or overexpression of a ligand that potentiates Wnt signaling,
   R-spondin 2 (RSPO2). Induction of Wnt signaling was sufficient to induce
   transformed properties in immortalized human Schwann cells, and
   downregulation of this pathway was sufficient to reduce the tumorigenic
   phenotype of human MPNST cell lines. Small-molecule inhibition of Wnt
   signaling effectively reduced the viability of MPNST cell lines and
   synergistically induced apoptosis when combined with an mTOR inhibitor,
   RAD-001, suggesting that Wnt inhibition represents a novel target for
   therapeutic intervention in Schwann cell tumors.
   SIGNIFICANCE: We show canonical Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is a novel
   genetic driver of Schwann cell tumor development and progression, due to
   downregulation of beta-catenin destruction complex members and
   overexpression of RSPO2. Inhibitors of Wnt signaling alone, or in
   combination with RAD-001, may have therapeutic value for patients with
   MPNSTs or neurofibromas. (c) 2013 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Biomass can be converted into a plethora of compounds through different
   chemical transformations, thus leading to a complex network of possible
   synthesis steps. In this work, we propose a novel strategy that
   simultaneously identifies (a) the most desirable biomass-derived
   products for an application of interest and (b) the corresponding
   synthesis routes. The strategy consists of i) constructing an exhaustive
   network of reactions consistent with an input set of chemistry rules and
   ii) using the network information to formulate and solve an optimization
   problem that yields an optimal product distribution and the sequence of
   reactions that synthesize them. We use this strategy to identify
   potential renewable oxygenates and hydrocarbons obtained from
   heterogeneous catalysis of biomass that can be blended with gasoline to
   satisfy ASTM specifications. Multiple objectives (energy loss, catalyst
   requirement, and absolute heat duty) are considered, and multiple
   alternative solutions are found in each case. We identified that both
   oxygenates and hydrocarbons are components of optimal blends for the
   energy loss objective, but the other two objectives produce only
   oxygenates. The proposed strategy is flexible enough to be applicable
   for any problem involving concurrent product and chemistry selection.}},

Abstract = {{Opportunistic routing utilizes the broadcast nature of wireless
   networks, significantly promoting the unicast throughput. Many
   variations of opportunistic routing designs have been proposed, although
   all of the current designs consistently rely on all of the topology
   information to construct forwarder lists and process data forwarding,
   which indeed restricts the application in large-scale wireless networks,
   where collecting global optimal information is very costly. In this
   paper, we propose the localized opportunistic routing (LOR) protocol,
   which utilizes the distributed minimum transmission selection (MTS-B)
   algorithm to partition the topology into several nested close-node-sets
   (CNSs) using local information. LOR can locally realize the optimal
   opportunistic routing for a large-scale wireless network with low
   control overhead cost. Since it does not use global topology
   information, LOR highlights an interesting tradeoff between the global
   optimality of the used forwarder lists and scalability inferred from the
   incurred overhead. Extensive simulation results show that LOR
   dramatically improves performances over extremely opportunistic routing
   (ExOR) and MAC-independent opportunistic routing protocol (MORE), which
   are two well-known designs from the literature, in terms of control
   overhead, end-to-end delay, and throughputs. It also exhibits promising
   performance in vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs).}},

Abstract = {{A normalization step is widely exercised in life cycle assessment (LCA)
   studies in order to better understand the relative significance of
   impact category results. In the normalization stage, normalization
   references (NRs) are the characterized results of a reference system,
   typically a national or regional economy. Normalization is widely
   practiced in LCA-based decision support and policy analysis (e.g., LCA
   cases in municipal solid waste treatment technologies, renewable energy
   technologies, and environmentally preferable purchasing programs, etc.).
   The compilation of NRs demands significant effort and time as well as an
   intimate knowledge of data availability and quality. Consequently only
   one set of published NRs is available for the United States, and has
   been adopted by various studies. In this study, the completeness of the
   previous NRs was evaluated and significant data gaps were identified.
   One of the reasons for the significant data gaps was that the toxic
   release inventory (TRI) data significantly underestimate the potential
   impact of toxic releases for some sectors. Also the previous NRs did not
   consider the soil emissions and nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) runoffs
   to water and chemical emissions to soils. Filling in these data gaps
   increased the magnitude of NRs for human health cancer, human health
   noncancer, ecotoxicity, and eutrophication significantly. Such
   significant changes can alter or even reverse the outcome of an LCA
   study. We applied the previous and updated NRs to conventional gasoline
   and corn ethanol LCAs. The results demonstrate that NRs play a decisive
   role in the interpretation of LCA results that use a normalization step.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple myeloma is a hematologic malignancy characterized by the
   proliferation of neoplastic plasma cells in the bone marrow. Although
   the first-to-market proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) has been
   successfully used to treat patients with myeloma, drug resistance
   remains an emerging problem. In this study, we identify signatures of
   bortezomib sensitivity and resistance by gene expression profiling (GEP)
   using pairs of bortezomib-sensitive (BzS) and bortezomib-resistant (BzR)
   cell lines created from the Bcl-X-L/Myc double-transgenic mouse model of
   multiple myeloma. Notably, these BzR cell lines show cross-resistance to
   the next-generation proteasome inhibitors, MLN2238 and carfilzomib
   (Kyprolis) but not to other antimyeloma drugs. We further characterized
   the response to bortezomib using the Connectivity Map database,
   revealing a differential response between these cell lines to histone
   deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Furthermore, in vivo experiments using
   the HDAC inhibitor panobinostat confirmed that the predicted responder
   showed increased sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors in the BzR line. These
   findings show that GEP may be used to document bortezomib resistance in
   myeloma cells and predict individual sensitivity to other drug classes.
   Finally, these data reveal complex heterogeneity within multiple myeloma
   and suggest that resistance to one drug class reprograms resistant
   clones for increased sensitivity to a distinct class of drugs. This
   study represents an important next step in translating pharmacogenomic
   profiling and may be useful for understanding personalized
   pharmacotherapy for patients with multiple myeloma. (C) 2013 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a facile polymer fabrication approach by combination of
   hot embossing and polymer shrinking is presented to reduce the feature

   projected structures are removed by a polishing process. Finally, new
   microstructures derive from the pre-pattern at the absence of removed
   materials after baking process. Through this way, both two- and
   three-dimensional hot embossed structures were successfully shrunk into
   a smaller scale. The width along two lateral directions reduced to
   two-fifths, and the height along vertical direction increased by 6
   times. Detailed features at different layers exhibit clearly
   three-dimensional shrunk microstructures. This polymer-shrinking process
   brings a new way to extend the fabrication capability of hot embossing

Abstract = {{To ensure sustainable operations of wireless sensor systems,
   environmental energy harvesting has been regarded as one of the most
   fundamental solutions for long-term applications. In energy-dynamic
   environments, energy conservation is no longer considered necessarily
   beneficial, because energy storage units (e.g., batteries or capacitors)
   are limited in capacity and leakage-prone. In contrast to legacy energy
   conservation approaches, we aim at energy-synchronized computing for
   wireless sensor devices. The starting point of this work is TwinStar,
   which uses ultra-capacitor as the only energy storage unit. To
   efficiently use the harvested energy, we design and implement
   leakage-aware feedback control techniques to match the activities of
   sensor nodes with dynamic energy supply from environments. We conduct
   system evaluation under both indoor and outdoor typical real-world
   settings. Results indicate our leakage-aware energy-synchronized control
   can effectively utilize energy that could otherwise leak away. (c) 2010

Abstract = {{Purpose: This study aimed to investigate whether push-in and pull-out
   tests measure mechanical properties of the bone-implant interface
   differently, and which test is more sensitive to changes over the
   healing period. Materials and Methods: Two identical self-threading
   dental implants (3.3x8.5mm) were placed in medial surface of the
   proximal condyles of left and right tibias of 20 rabbits (40 implants
   total). Five rabbits each were sacrificed after 1, 4, 8, and 12 weeks of
   healing. Push-in test was performed on one side's tibia implant and
   pull-out on the other side's implant, at a rate of 6mm/min. Primary and
   secondary implant stabilities and tibia weight were measured on all
   implants. Results: The push-in test generated significantly higher
   failure load (p=.0001; 530N vs 279N), lower displacement at failure
   (p=.0003; 0.436mm vs 0.680mm), and higher interface stiffness (p<.0001;
   1,641N/mm vs 619N/mm) than pull-out test. Failure load, stiffness, and
   secondary implant stability were significantly higher for longer
   compared with shorter healing periods, while displacement, tibia weight,
   and primary stability were not. Failure load and stiffness differed
   significantly for four healing times for the push-in but not for the
   pull-out test. Failure load was significantly correlated with secondary
   implant stability for both push-in (r=0.66) and pull-out (r=0.48) tests,
   but stiffness was significantly correlated with secondary stability only
   for the push-in test (r=0.72; pull-out test r=0.40). Conclusion: The
   push-in test appeared more sensitive than pull-out to changes in
   mechanical properties at bone-implant interfaces during healing in
   rabbit tibia model.}},

Abstract = {{In a heterogeneous wireless cellular network, each user may be covered
   by multiple access points such as macro/pico/relay/femto base stations
   (BS). An effective approach to maximize the sum utility (e. g., system
   throughput) in such a network is to jointly optimize users' linear
   procoders as well as their BS associations. In this paper, we first show
   that this joint optimization problem is NP-hard and thus is difficult to
   solve to global optimality. To find a locally optimal solution, we
   formulate the problem as a noncooperative game in which the users and
   the BSs both act as players. We introduce a set of new utility functions
   for the players and show that every Nash equilibrium (NE) of the
   resulting game is a stationary solution of the original sum utility
   maximization problem. Moreover, we develop a best-response type
   algorithm that allows the players to distributedly reach a NE of the
   game. Simulation results show that the proposed distributed algorithm
   can effectively relieve local BS congestion and simultaneously achieve
   high throughput and load balancing in a heterogeneous network.}},

Title = {{Minimum energy control for in vitro neurons}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Objective. To demonstrate the applicability of optimal control theory
   for designing minimum energy charge-balanced input waveforms for single
   periodically-firing in vitro neurons from brain slices of Long-Evans
   rats. Approach. The method of control uses the phase model of a neuron
   and does not require prior knowledge of the neuron's biological details.
   The phase model of a neuron is a one-dimensional model that is
   characterized by the neuron's phase response curve (PRC), a sensitivity
   measure of the neuron to a stimulus applied at different points in its
   firing cycle. The PRC for each neuron is experimentally obtained by
   measuring the shift in phase due to a short-duration pulse injected into
   the periodically-firing neuron at various phase values. Based on the
   measured PRC, continuous-time, charge-balanced, minimum energy control
   waveforms have been designed to regulate the next firing time of the
   neuron upon application at the onset of an action potential. Main
   result. The designed waveforms can achieve the inter-spike-interval
   regulation for in vitro neurons with energy levels that are lower than
   those of conventional monophasic pulsatile inputs of past studies by at
   least an order of magnitude. They also provide the advantage of being
   charge-balanced. The energy efficiency of these waveforms is also shown
   by performing several supporting simulations that compare the
   performance of the designed waveforms against that of phase shuffled
   surrogate inputs, variants of the minimum energy waveforms obtained from
   suboptimal PRCs, as well as pulsatile stimuli that are applied at the
   point of maximum PRC. It was found that the minimum energy waveforms
   perform better than all other stimuli both in terms of control and in
   the amount of energy used. Specifically, it was seen that these
   charge-balanced waveforms use at least an order of magnitude less energy
   than conventional monophasic pulsatile stimuli. Significance. The
   significance of this work is that it uses concepts from the theory of
   optimal control and introduces a novel approach in designing minimum
   energy charge-balanced input waveforms for neurons that are robust to
   noise and implementable in electrophysiological experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the collaborative modeling process and the
   resulting water resources planning model developed to evaluate water
   management scenarios in the transboundary Rio Grande basin. The Rio
   Grande is a severely water stressed basin that faces numerous management
   challenges as it crosses numerous jurisdictional boundaries. A
   collaborative process was undertaken to identify and model water
   management scenarios to improve water supply for stakeholders, the
   environment, and international obligations of water delivery from Mexico
   to the United States. A transparent and open process of data collection,
   model building, and scenario development was completed by a project
   steering committee composed of university, nongovernmental, and
   governmental experts from both countries. The outcome of the process was
   a planning model described in this article, with data and operations
   that were agreed on by water planning officials in each country. Water
   management scenarios were created from stakeholder input and were
   modeled and evaluated for effectiveness with the planning model.}},

Abstract = {{Recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) is characterized by a
   functional deficit of type VII collagen protein due to gene defects in
   the type VII collagen gene (COL7A1). Gene augmentation therapies are
   promising, but run the risk of insertional mutagenesis. To abrogate this
   risk, we explored the possibility of using engineered transcription
   activator-like effector nucleases (TALEN) for precise genome editing. We
   report the ability of TALEN to induce site-specific double-stranded DNA
   breaks (DSBs) leading to homology-directed repair (HDR) from an
   exogenous donor template. This process resulted in COL7A1 gene mutation
   correction in primary fibroblasts that were subsequently reprogrammed
   into inducible pluripotent stem cells and showed normal protein
   expression and deposition in a teratoma-based skin model in vivo. Deep
   sequencing-based genome-wide screening established a safety profile
   showing on-target activity and three off-target (OT) loci that,
   importantly, were at least 10 kb from a coding sequence. This study
   provides proof-of-concept for TALEN-mediated in situ correction of an
   endogenous patient-specific gene mutation and used an unbiased screen
   for comprehensive TALEN target mapping that will cooperatively
   facilitate translational application.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated specific absorption rate (SAR) associated with increased main
   magnetic field strength remains a major safety concern in
   ultra-high-field (UHF) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) applications.
   The calculation of local SAR requires the knowledge of the electric
   field induced by radio-frequency (RF) excitation, and the local
   electrical properties of tissues. Since electric field distribution
   cannot be directly mapped in conventional MR measurements, SAR
   estimation is usually performed using numerical model-based
   electromagnetic simulations which, however, are highly time consuming
   and cannot account for the specific anatomy and tissue properties of the
   subject undergoing a scan. In the present study, starting from the
   measurable RF magnetic fields (B-1) in MRI, we conducted a series of
   mathematical deduction to estimate the local, voxel-wise and
   subject-specific SAR for each single coil element using a multi-channel
   transceiver array coil. We first evaluated the feasibility of this
   approach in numerical simulations including two different human head
   models. We further conducted experimental study in a physical phantom
   and in two human subjects at 7T using a multi-channel transceiver head
   coil. Accuracy of the results is discussed in the context of predicting
   local SAR in the human brain at UHF MRI using multi-channel RF
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the sparse spectrum fitting (SpSF) algorithm for the
   estimation of directions-of-arrival (DOAs) of multiple sources is
   introduced, and its asymptotic consistency and effective regularization
   under both asymptotic and finite sample cases are studied. Specifically,
   through the analysis of the optimality conditions of the method, we
   prove the asymptotic, in the number of snapshots, consistency of SpSF
   estimators of the DOAs and the received powers of uncorrelated sources
   in a sparse spatial spectra model. Along with this result, an explicit
   formula of the best regularization parameter of SpSF estimator with
   infinitely many snapshots is obtained. We then build on these results to
   investigate the problem of selecting an appropriate regularization
   parameter for SpSF with finite snapshots. An automatic selector of such
   regularization parameter is presented based on the formulation of an
   upper bound on the probability of correct support recovery of SpSF,
   which can be efficiently evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations.
   Simulation results illustrating the effectiveness and performance of
   this selector are provided, and the application of SpSF to
   direction-finding for correlated sources is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Electrohydrodynamic instabilities in thin liquid films are a promising
   route for the self-assembly of well-defined topographical features on
   the surfaces of materials. Here, we study the effect of viscoelasticity
   on these instabilities under the influence of AC and DC electric fields.
   Viscoelasticity is incorporated via a Jeffreys model, and both perfect
   and leaky dielectric materials are considered. In the case of DC fields,
   asymptotic methods are employed to shed light on the nature of a
   singularity that arises when solvent viscosity is neglected (i.e., the
   Maxwell-fluid limit). In the case of AC fields, we apply a numerical
   procedure based on Floquet theory to determine the maximum growth rate
   and corresponding wave number as a function of the oscillation amplitude
   and frequency. Elasticity is found to increase both the maximum growth
   rate and corresponding wave number, with the effects being most
   pronounced when the oscillation period is comparable to the fluid
   relaxation time. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   tyrosine kinases, and their signaling has been shown to play a diverse
   role in various cellular processes. The recent advances in the study of
   ephrin-Eph signaling have shown promising progress in many fields of
   medicine. They have been implicated in the pathophysiology of various
   cancers and in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis. Recent
   studies have shown that manipulation of ephrin-Eph cell signaling can
   favorably influence cardiomyocyte viability and ultimately preserve
   cardiac function post-MI. In this article, we explore the hypothesis
   that manipulation of ephrin-Eph signaling may potentially be a novel
   therapeutic target in the treatment of MI through alteration of the
   cellular processes that govern injury and wound healing. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The direct compression (DC) technology is increasingly popular in the
   manufacture of tablets due to its efficiency and economy. However, its
   use in the production of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) tablets is
   often limited owing to poor powder flow and compaction properties of TCM

   in Fufang Danshen tablet, a popular TCM for treating angina pectoris, by
   particle surface engineering. Both the active ingredients (Danshen root,
   Notoginseng, and Borneol) and formulated Danshen mixture exhibit
   flowability too poor to be processed directly on a high speed tablet
   press. By dry coating with 1\% silica nanoparticles, the flowability,
   tabletability, and fillability of these powders were adequately improved
   to be suitable for DC. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Motor vehicle crashes involving civilian and emergency vehicles (EVs)
   have been a known problem that contributes to fatal and nonfatal
   injuries; however, characteristics associated with civilian drivers have
   not been examined adequately. This study used data from The National
   Highway Traffic Safety Administration's Fatality Analysis Reporting
   System and the National Automotive Sampling System General Estimates
   System to identify driver, roadway, environmental, and crash factors,
   and consequences for civilian drivers involved in fatal and nonfatal
   crashes with in-use and in-transport EVs. In general, drivers involved
   in emergency-civilian crashes (ECCs) were more often driving: straight
   through intersections (vs. same direction) of four-points or more (vs.
   not at intersection); where traffic signals were present (vs. no traffic
   control device); and at night (vs. midday). For nonfatal ECCs, drivers
   were more often driving: distracted (vs. not distracted); with vision
   obstructed by external objects (vs. no obstruction); on dark but lighted
   roads (vs. daylight); and in opposite directions (vs. same directions)
   of the EVs. Consequences included increased risk of injury (vs. no
   injury) and receiving traffic violations (vs. no violation). Fatal ECCs
   were associated with driving on urban roads (vs. rural), although these
   types of crashes were less likely to occur on dark roads (vs. daylight).
   The findings of this study suggest drivers may have difficulties in
   visually detecting EVs in different environments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{244}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{75-86}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Computational modeling can be a powerful tool for an experimentalist,
   providing a rigorous mathematical model of the system you are studying.
   This can be valuable in testing your hypotheses and developing
   experimental protocols prior to experimenting. This paper reviews models
   of seizures and epilepsy at different scales, including cellular,
   network, cortical region, and brain scales by looking at how they have
   been used in conjunction with experimental data. At each scale, models
   with different levels of abstraction, the extraction of physiological
   detail, are presented. Varying levels of detail are necessary in
   different situations. Physiologically realistic models are valuable
   surrogates for experimental systems because, unlike in an experiment,
   every parameter can be changed and every variable can be observed.
   Abstract models are useful in determining essential parameters of a
   system, allowing the experimentalist to extract principles that explain
   the relationship between mechanisms and the behavior of the system.
   Modeling is becoming easier with the emergence of platforms dedicated to
   neuronal modeling and databases of models that can be downloaded.
   Modeling will never be a replacement for animal and clinical
   experiments, but it should be a starting point in designing experiments
   and understanding their results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Large eddy simulation and direct numerical simulation of homogeneous

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{21-33}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of nanoparticle nucleation in turbulent wakes are
   performed. We consider the homogeneous nucleation of dibutyl-phthalate
   (DBP) nanoparticles via direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy
   simulation (LES). The flows consist of a high-temperature, DBP-laden
   stream issuing into a low-temperature, faster moving, DBP-free
   environment. In the DNS, all relevant length and time-scales are
   resolved, and the Navier-Stokes equations, along with the species
   transport equations are solved in a ``model-free{''} manner. These
   provide knowledge of the fluid, thermal, and species fields as a
   function of space and time. DBP nucleation is modeled via classical
   nucleation theory. The unresolved fluxes in the LES are modeled using
   modified kinetic-energy viscosity based gradient-diffusion closures.
   These allow the representation of the unresolved or sub-grid (SGS)
   stress, and fluid-scalar fluxes in terms of resolved-scale quantities.
   To illustrate the effects of the SGS interactions on homogeneous
   nucleation in turbulent flows, the unresolved scalar-scalar interactions
   appearing in the nucleation source term are neglected. The magnitude of
   the unresolved scales is varied by performing the LES at two
   resolutions. The results show that nucleation initially occurs in the
   shear layers where molecular transport dominates and across the span of
   the wake once the core collapses and the flow transitions to turbulence.
   Pre-transition, the saturation ratio - representative of the driving
   force for particle formation - predicted by the LES and DNS are quite
   similar. Post-transition, the saturation ratios predicted by the LES are
   significantly greater than those predicted by the DNS, and the
   discrepancy increases as the filter-width increases (and resolution
   decreases). This dynamic is also reflected in the nucleation rate. The
   LES predicts nucleation rates between one and two orders of magnitude
   greater than the DNS the discrepancy increases as the resolution
   decreases. There is also a shift towards the nucleation of smaller
   nanoparticles in the LES compared to the DNS. The results suggest that
   the SGS scalar-scalar interactions act to decrease the rate of
   nucleation and increase nuclei size. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Magnetic Fe nanoparticles were fabricated using a
   magnetron-sputtering-based gas-phase condensation method, and they have
   an average size of 20 nm. The Fe nanoparticles were modified by
   3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane, and were subsequently activated by
   glutaraldehyde, and then amino modified DNA oligomers were loaded on
   glutaraldehyde activated Fe nanoparticles. Their surface was
   investigated and confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).
   The concentrations of 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane and glutaraldehyde
   play important roles for subsequent DNA immobilization, and their
   optimal concentrations are 0.5 vol\% and 5.0 wt\%, respectively. The
   loading level of DNA oligomers on Fe nanoparticles was quantitatively
   evaluated. We found that the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)
   surfactant can significantly increase the DNA loading level and the
   highest loading value reached to 47 mol DNA/mol Fe nanoparticles. The
   DNA-Fe complexes can be selectively hybridized to the DNA functionalized

Abstract = {{Spatially averaged velocity distributions, turbulence characteristics,
   and stream bed roughness elevations were collected in two streams with
   rough-bed substrate. Variogram analysis of substrate roughness height
   yielded characteristic length scales of the stream bed over which bed
   elevations were correlated from 0.14 to 0.41 m. Temporally and spatially
   averaged (double-averaged) vertical velocity profiles followed a
   composite distribution consisting of a linear distribution below the
   roughness crest height and a power or wake law above the crest. Our
   double-averaged velocity data demonstrated the applicability of both the
   wake law and power law to open-channel flow for which a low ratio of
   flow depth to roughness height does not support the development of the
   universal logarithmic velocity law. A power-law scaling relationship
   among spatially averaged Glossosoma density, stream bed roughness
   characteristics, and double-averaged fluid flow conditions was
   developed. The density of Glossosoma scaled directly with substrate
   crest elevation, normalized spatial fluctuation of longitudinal velocity
   in the proximity of the bed, and inversely with the standard deviation
   of the crest elevation. The proposed dimensionless scaling relationship
   explains 84 \% of the Glossosoma variability.}},

Abstract = {{The I-35W St. Anthony Falls Bridge was constructed to replace the steel
   truss bridge that collapsed on August 1, 2007. The design of the
   replacement bridge featured a smart-bridge system. The smart-bridge
   concept included instrumentation for long-term monitoring of the
   structural behavior of the bridge. Truck-load tests were conducted prior
   to opening the bridge and 26 months later to measure the response of the
   structure under controlled loading. The measurements were used to
   validate a FEM model of the bridge constructed to further investigate
   the behavior of the structure. The correlation between computed and
   measured results was found to be good. This paper describes the bridge,
   the instrumentation installed within the bridge, the FEM model, and
   validation of the model with respect to the truck-load tests.

Title = {{On the KZK-type equation for modulated ultrasound fields}},
Journal = {{WAVE MOTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This study introduces a KZK-type model describing the nonlinear wave
   propagation due to ``slowly{''} modulated ultrasound excitation, where
   the ratio between the (dominant) modulation frequency and the carrier
   frequency is 0(1). The model is relevant to a variety of diagnostic
   techniques where the acoustic radiation force, generated by a focused
   ultrasound beam, is used to palpate tissue locally within the focal
   region. An indispensable prerequisite for computing the acoustic
   radiation force, however, is a precise knowledge of the nonlinear wave
   field generated by the ultrasound transducer at hand. In this class of
   applications, the MHz carrier signal is commonly modulated with
   frequencies on the order of 10(2) divided by 10(4) Hz which, in the
   context of the time-domain numerical algorithms, dramatically increases
   the computational effort necessary to simulate the nonlinear wave field.
   To alleviate the impediment, this study employs a dual time scale
   approach towards the development of an intermediate asymptotics solution
   that fits the gap between the quasi-static approximation and the full
   solution. Thus obtained modification of the KZK equation, which captures
   the leading effects of ``slow{''} ultrasound modulation, lends itself to
   an effective computational treatment that makes use of suitable
   steady-state solutions. For generality, the asymptotic analysis deploys
   separate scaling parameters to describe the effects of diffraction and
   modulation, consequently allowing the model to (i) cover a wide range of
   transducer geometries, and (ii) be degenerated to the quasi-static
   approximation as one of its limiting cases. The formulation is
   accompanied by a set of numerical examples, which illustrate the
   applicability of the method to both ``short{''} and ``long{''}
   modulation envelopes while accounting for realistic
   (frequency-dependent) attenuation in a tissue. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{821-835}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of wave propagation in nonlinear periodic structures is often
   limited to the determination of the spectral characteristics of wave
   motion (dispersion relations). Unfortunately, the physical features of
   wave propagation are only partially highlighted by a spectral
   description. The objective of this work is to elucidate the relation
   between topological/physical (space time domain) and spectral
   (wavenumber frequency domain) features of wave motion in periodic chains
   with weak nonlinearities. The analysis is based on full-scale transient
   analysis of finite chains, from which dispersion curves are generated
   and verified against the results of unit-cell based perturbation
   methods. The evolution of spatial and spectral features is monitored
   using signal processing techniques such as spatial-spectrogram and
   wavenumber filtering, and the interplay of dispersive and nonlinear
   mechanisms in the process of waveform distortion is evaluated. The
   relation between Topological features and spectral characteristics is
   determined using appropriate topological wave packet descriptors. It is
   found that certain packet descriptors are sensitive to the parameters of
   the nonlinear constitutive relation and can therefore be used to
   construct inverse problems to estimate nonlinearity in systems with
   unknown constitutive models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   The tremendous increase in computational speed is accompanied by
   enormous power consumption in these systems. It is necessary to harvest
   any potential opportunities to save power in these high end computing

   savings in the interconnects between the nodes. By careful scheduling of
   jobs in a 3D torus-connected cluster of nodes, we show that significant
   amounts of power can be saved by switching certain portions of the
   network elements to low power modes. We also present an estimation
   method that more accurately estimates the actual runtime of jobs from
   the user provided runtimes and enhances the performance of the
   scheduling scheme. We validate our results via detailed MATLAB

Volume = {{3}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Much research has been conducted on energy efficient cache buffer
   management for disk based storage systems. Some of them use greedy
   prefetching technique to artificially increase disk idle intervals if
   there is a large number of known future requests. However, this might
   result in sub-optimal solution by not exploiting the relationship
   between I/O access pattern (sequential/random) and application pattern
   (cpu time required for computing). In a cpu-bound application, by
   explicitly taking into account the required CPU time it may reduce
   energy conservation by up to 50\% and increase power cycle number by
   100\% compared to an existing efficient prefetching scheme without this
   consideration. In this paper, we consider the tradeoff between disk
   power consumption, performance guarantee and disk reliability all
   together by proposing a Disk characteristic based Power-Optimal
   Prefetching (DiscPOP) scheme. Specifically, we make three contributions:
   (i) A theoretical model is proposed to analyze energy-efficient cache
   buffer management in disk I/O system and it was formulated as an
   optimization problem. We have shown it can be solved via an Integer
   Linear Programming (ILP) technique, we further conduct the following
   research. (ii) For offline cases, we proposed a Greedy Partition
   algorithm (GP) to divide the problem into several small ones and solve
   them separately via the proposed ILP algorithm. (iii) For online cases,
   we proposed two heuristic algorithms based on Lazy Start Power-Optimal
   Prefetching (LSPOP) technique. Both of them use simple threshold
   controlled algorithms to select a prefetching start judiciously and
   cautiously. We use a trace-driven simulation to evaluate our proposed
   schemes. The results show GP outperforms the traditional aggressive
   prefetching by up to 26.9\% more disk energy conservation and 17.8\%
   power cycle reduction. The online heuristic algorithms can also improve
   disk energy saving by up to 20.5\% and reduce power cycle by 14.3\%. (C)

Abstract = {{In recent years, cloud sync(hronization) services such as GoogleDrive
   and Dropbox have provided Internet users with convenient and reliable
   data storing/sharing functionality. The cloud synchronization mechanism
   (in particular, how to deliver the user-side data updates to the cloud)
   plays a critical role in cloud sync services because it greatly affects
   the cloud operation cost (in terms of sync traffic) and user experience
   (in terms of sync delay). By comprehensively measuring tens of popular
   cloud sync services, we find that their cloud sync mechanisms differ
   greatly in sync performance and design granularity. Quite surprisingly,
   some very popular services (like GoogleDrive and 115 SyncDisk) utilize a
   quite coarse-grained cloud sync mechanism that may lead to severe
   traffic overuse. For example, updating 1-MB data may sometimes result in
   260-MB sync traffic. In this paper, we conduct a comparative study of
   various cloud sync mechanisms by analyzing their respective pros and
   cons under different situations, unravel the pathological processes for
   their traffic overuse problems, and finally provide insights/solutions
   for better choosing/designing a cloud sync service.}},

Abstract = {{Many real-life stains have origins from biological matters including
   proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates that act as gluing agents binding
   along with other particulates or microbes to exposed surfaces of
   automobiles, furniture, and fabrics. Mimicking naturally occurring
   self-defensive processes, we demonstrate in this work that a solid
   surface carrying partially exposed enzyme granules protected the surface
   in situ from contamination by biological stains and fingerprints.
   Attributed to the activities of enzymes which can be made compatible
   with a wide range of materials, such anti-contamination and
   self-cleaning functionalities are highly selective and efficient toward
   sticky chemicals. This observation promises a new mechanism in
   developing smart materials with desired anti-microbial, self-reporting,

Title = {{Parasitic pressure losses in diffusers and in their downstream piping
   systems for fluid flow and heat transfer}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Pages = {{56-61}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The need for precise design of piping systems and of ducts which
   interconnect fluid flow and heat transfer equipment of different
   dimensional scales depends on the availability of basic fluid flow
   information. One of the most ubiquitous features in a system which
   transports fluids is the occurrence of changes in flow cross section. In
   particular, enlargements of the flow cross section give rise to
   parasitic pressure losses both in the enlargement fitting and in the
   piping system that is downstream of the enlargement. The most commonly
   used enlargement fittings are diffusers. Although there is some
   information about pressure losses that are caused by flows in diffusers,
   it is highly contradictory and, equally significant, the available
   information takes no account of the heightened pressure losses in the
   downstream piping which are due to the highly disturbed flow that exits
   the diffuser. This investigation was undertaken to provide definitive
   information on diffuser-created parasitic pressure losses that occur in
   response to all possible operating conditions, including the Reynolds
   number at the diffuser inlet, the diffuser opening angle, and the ratio
   of the exit and inlet diameters of the diffuser. This information is
   cast in dimen-sionless form and is presented as incremental departures
   from a simply calculated baseline case. In addition, the lengths of pipe
   downstream of the diffuser that are required to dampen the
   irregularities of the diffuser exit flow are presented as a necessary
   prerequisite for the proper use of the incremental pressure drop
   results. It was found that the incremental pressure drop increases
   monotonically with increasing diffuser opening angle. In general, the
   incremental pressure drop values for a given diffuser opening angle
   decrease with increasing Reynolds number and tend to level off as the
   Reynolds number further increases. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Linear failure criteria with three principal stresses}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{180-187}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Any failure criterion can be represented as a surface in principal
   stress space sigma(1), sigma(2), sigma(3) (with no order implied), and
   the shape of the surface depends on the functional form of the
   criterion. For isotropic rock that exhibits a pressure dependence on
   strength, the simplest failure criterion is a linear function, and the
   failure surface is a hexagonal pyramid with a common vertex V-o on the
   tension side of the hydrostatic axis, where V-o=(theoretical) uniform
   triaxial tensile strength. An example of a pyramidal failure surface is
   the popular Mohr-Coulomb criterion, which is independent of the
   intermediate principal stress sigma(II) (sigma(I) >= sigma(II) >=
   sigma(III)) and contains two material parameters, such as V-o and the
   internal friction angle phi.
   The Paul-Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion A sigma(I)+B sigma(II)+C
   sigma(III)=1 is linear with three principal stresses, and it is
   formulated with three identifiable material constants, where A=(1 - sin
   phi(c))/(2V(o)sin phi(c)), B=(sin phi(c) - sin phi(e))/(2V(o)sin
   phi(c)sin phi(e)), C=-(1+sin phi(e))/(2V(o)sin phi(e)) and phi(c),
   phi(e) are internal friction angles for compression
   (sigma(II)=sigma(III)) and extension (sigma(I)=sigma(II)). The convex
   nature of the failure surface at constant mean stress can be
   approximated by additional planes with appropriate material parameters.
   To demonstrate the utility of the linear failure criterion, a series of
   conventional triaxial compression and extension experiments were
   performed on an isotropic rock. The results were processed using the
   developed data fitting techniques, and the material parameters for the
   six-sided pyramidal failure surface were determined. A multi-axial
   experiment was also performed to evaluate the convexity of the failure
   surface, and a twelve-sided pyramid was constructed and the appropriate
   equations were derived. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},
Pages = {{235-245}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Evaluation of mode I fracture characteristics, such as critical opening
   displacement and process-zone length, is fundamental for the analysis
   and prediction of crack growth. To identify deformation with
   micron-scale resolution, experiments were performed using digital image
   correlation, where displacement is determined through a comparison of a
   pair of digital images by matching a small area from the image before
   deformation to the image after deformation. The matching process uses a
   cross-correlation algorithm, and within this study, the correlation is
   based on a Fast Fourier Transform method. Mode I fracture tests were
   performed on Berea sandstone using three-point bending. Twelve
   specimens, of three types, were fabricated: six center notch (0.5 mm
   radius), three smooth boundary, and three reduced-section (6 or 12 mm
   radius notch). The characteristics of tensile fracture, namely opening
   displacement and crack length, were extracted from detailed displacement
   measurements. At the onset of unstable propagation (peak load) for the
   center notch specimens, the critical opening displacement omega(c)=30 mu
   m at the notch tip, and as the crack propagated, the known position of
   omega(c) allowed the identification of the process zone throughout the
   post-peak response. Incremental displacement contours established the
   tip of the effective crack, and the length of the process zone l(p)=5-7
   mm, about 10 times the maximum grain size. In addition, it was observed
   that the process zone maintained a constant length with constant
   critical opening for all tests. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Rapid thermal processing (RTP) was shown to be effective in reducing
   defects, especially grain boundary defects in c-oriented MFI membranes
   (Choi et al., Science 325 (2009) 590-593). In this study, the xylene and
   butane separation performances of RTP-treated c-oriented MFI membranes,
   which were now synthesized with a shorter secondary growth time (from 2
   d to 1 d), were investigated. These membranes achieved a good
   performance for separating both p-/o-xylene (similar to 88 separation
   factor (SF)) and n-/i-butane (similar to 30 SF) isomers. In addition,
   fluorescence confocal optical microscopy was conducted to explore the
   defect structure by varying the contact time with the dye solution. This
   characterization revealed that the accessibility of dye molecules to
   grain boundary defects at the molecular level can be correlated with
   separation performance. Finally, the fluxes of xylene and butane isomers
   across RTP-treated c-oriented MFI membranes were deciphered by the
   Maxwell-Stefan formulation to obtain their diffusion coefficients. The
   diffusivities of the slow permeating component (i.e., o-xylene) were
   estimated to be lower than the literature values obtained by a zero
   length column method; this accounted for the high p-/o-xylene SF. We
   considered the combination of adsorbate-adsorbate and adsorbate-zeolite
   interactions to calculate the diffusivities of n-/i-butane isomers. (c)

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Genome-wide association study (GWAS) has revolutionized the search for
   the genetic basis of complex traits. To date, GWAS have generally relied
   on relatively sparse sampling of nucleotide diversity, which is likely
   to bias results by preferentially sampling high-frequency SNPs not in
   complete linkage disequilibrium (LD) with causative SNPs. To avoid these
   limitations we conducted GWAS with >6 million SNPs identified by
   sequencing the genomes of 226 accessions of the model legume Medicago
   truncatula. We used these data to identify candidate genes and the
   genetic architecture underlying phenotypic variation in plant height,
   trichome density, flowering time, and nodulation. The characteristics of
   candidate SNPs differed among traits, with candidates for flowering time
   and trichome density in distinct clusters of high linkage disequilibrium
   (LD) and the minor allele frequencies (MAF) of candidates underlying
   variation in flowering time and height significantly greater than MAF of
   candidates underlying variation in other traits. Candidate SNPs tagged
   several characterized genes including nodulation related genes SERK2,
   MtnodGRP3, MtMMPL1, NFP, CaML3, MtnodGRP3A and flowering time gene MtFD
   as well as uncharacterized genes that become candidates for further
   molecular characterization. By comparing sequence-based candidates to
   candidates identified by in silico 250K SNP arrays, we provide an
   empirical example of how reliance on even high-density reduced
   representation genomic makers can bias GWAS results. Depending on the
   trait, only 30-70\% of the top 20 in silico array candidates were within
   1 kb of sequence-based candidates. Moreover, the sequence-based
   candidates tagged by array candidates were heavily biased towards common
   variants; these comparisons underscore the need for caution when
   interpreting results from GWAS conducted with sparsely covered genomes.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of a pressure induced iron-related spin crossover in
   Mg(1-x)FexO ferropericlase (Fp) and Mg-silicate perovskite, the major
   phases of Earth's lower mantle, has raised new questions about mantle
   properties which are of central importance to seismology. Despite
   extensive experimental work on the anomalous elasticity of Fp throughout
   the crossover, inconsistencies reported in the literature are still
   unexplained. Here we introduce a formulation for thermoelasticity of
   spin crossover systems, apply it to Fp by combining it with predictive
   first principles density-functional theory with on-site repulsion
   parameter U calculations, and contrast results with available data on
   samples with various iron concentrations. We explain why the shear
   modulus of Fp should not soften along the crossover, as observed in some
   experiments, predict its velocities at lower mantle conditions, and show
   the importance of constraining the elastic properties of minerals
   without extrapolations for analyses of the thermochemical state of this
   region.}},

Abstract = {{The recovery of propylene from polypropylene (PP) exhaust gas has great
   significance for improving production efficiency and protecting
   environment. The solubilities of propylene were measured first in
   various alcoholic solutions, and then the separation of propylene and
   nitrogen was investigated by alcohol absorption method. On the base of
   SRK equation of state and Wilson activity coefficients model, the
   solubilities of propylene in different alcoholic solutions and
   conditions were calculated. The average absolute relative deviation
   between the calculated solubilities and experimental values at fixed
   conditions is 5.30\%. The separation experiments were conducted in pure
   n-butanol and ethylene glycol, respectively, and the influences of
   temperature and pressure on the separation efficiency were investigated
   as well. The results indicate that n-butanol shows a better separation
   performance than ethylene glycol under the same conditions. High
   pressure and low temperature are conductive to high concentration and
   recovery of propylene in product gas. Under 303 K and 1.49 MPa,
   propylene is concentrated from 20 mol\% in feed gas to 92.31 mol\% with
   a recovery of 79.69\% after separation. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   Modeling and experiments}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{221-231}},
Month = {{MAY 24}},
Abstract = {{The spreading and merging of perfectly wetting liquid streams flowing
   down an inclined plane is considered in this work using a combination of
   modeling and experiments. Feed ports located near the top of the
   inclined plane deliver the liquid at constant flow rate. The lubrication
   approximation and a point-source description of the feed ports are used
   to develop a fourth-order partial differential equation describing the
   stream height as a function of position and time. Dynamic contact lines
   are handled by assuming the existence of a thin precursor film near the
   stream edges. Flow from a single feed port is first characterized with
   the model, thereby extending prior work to account for the effects of
   surface tension. Flow from two feed ports is then examined with the
   model, and the results are compared to experimental observations. It is
   found that even though the model overpredicts the experimentally
   observed positions of the leading edges of the streams, it accurately
   predicts their velocities both before and after merging. The discrepancy
   is attributed to a failure at very early times of the assumptions
   underlying the lubrication approximation. Nevertheless, the results
   imply that lubrication-theory-based models can still be employed to make
   reasonably accurate predictions, and thus lay the basis for the
   development of such models to describe the coating of discrete objects.

Abstract = {{The photoluminescence (PL) of size-purified silicon nanocrystals is
   measured as a function of temperature and nanoparticle size for pure
   nanocrystal films and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) nanocomposites. The
   temperature dependence of the bandgap is the same for both sample types,
   being measurably different from that of bulk silicon because of quantum
   confinement. Our results also suggest weaker interparticle and
   environmental coupling in the nanocomposites, with enhanced PL and an
   unexpected dependence of lifetime on size for the pure nanocrystal films
   at low temperatures. We interpret these results through differences in
   the low temperature size dependence of the ensemble nonradiative
   equilibrium constants. The response of the PDMS nanocomposites provides
   a consistent measure of local temperature through intensity, lifetime,
   and wavelength in a polymer dispersed morphology suitable for biomedical
   applications, and we exploit this to fabricate a small-footprint
   fiber-optic cryothermometer. A comparison of the two sample types offers
   fundamental insight into the photoluminescent behavior of silicon
   nanocrystal ensembles.}},

Abstract = {{Ion/electrical mobility measurements of nanoparticles and polyatomic
   ions are typically linked to particle/ion physical properties through
   either application of the Stokes-Millikan relationship or comparison to
   mobilities predicted from polyatomic models, which assume that gas
   molecules scatter specularly and elastically from rigid structural
   models. However, there is a discrepancy between these approaches; when
   specular, elastic scattering models (i.e., elastic-hard-sphere
   scattering, EHSS) are applied to polyatomic models of nanometer-scale
   ions with finite-sized impinging gas molecules, predictions are in
   substantial disagreement with the Stokes-Millikan equation. To rectify
   this discrepancy, we developed and tested a new approach for mobility
   calculations using polyatomic models in which non-specular (diffuse) and
   inelastic gas-molecule scattering is considered. Two distinct
   semiempirical models of gas-molecule scattering from particle surfaces
   were considered. In the first, which has been traditionally invoked in
   the study of aerosol nanoparticles, 91\% of collisions are diffuse and
   thermally accommodating, and 9\% are specular and elastic. In the
   second, all collisions are considered to be diffuse and accommodating,
   but the average speed of the gas molecules reemitted from a particle
   surface is 8\% lower than the mean thermal speed at the particle
   temperature. Both scattering models attempt to mimic exchange between
   translational, vibrational, and rotational modes of energy during
   collision, as would be expected during collision between a nonmonoatomic
   gas molecule and a nonfrozen particle surface. The mobility calculation
   procedure was applied considering both hard-sphere potentials between
   gas molecules and the atoms within a particle and the long-range ion
   induced dipole (polarization) potential. Predictions were compared to
   previous measurements in air near room temperature of multiply charged
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) ions, which range in morphology from compact
   to highly linear, and singly charged tetraalkylammonium cations. It was
   found that both non-specular, inelastic scattering rules lead to
   excellent agreement between predictions and experimental mobility
   measurements (within 5\% of each other) and that polarization potentials
   must be considered to make correct predictions for high-mobility
   particles/ions. Conversely, traditional specular, elastic scattering
   models were found to substantially overestimate the mobilities of both
   types of ions.}},

Abstract = {{Here, DC power supplies were applied on as-deposited non-perpendicular
   FePt single films or perpendicular FePt/Au multilayer films to control
   momentum exchanges between rapid moving electrons and Fe or Pt atoms.
   Moreover, lattice defects in the films provide abundant diffusion
   pathways for atomic rearrangement. Through the current driven atomic
   motion and rearrangement, fast LOP and hard magnet properties were
   realized in the FePt alloy films without heat treatment. The
   electromigration effect appears to be general and is applicable for the
   ordering in other magnetic materials with a L1(0) structure. (C) 2013

Title = {{Relative importance of breakage and decay as processes depleting large
   wood from streams}},
Journal = {{GEOMORPHOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{190}},
Pages = {{40-47}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Large wood pieces affect virtually every physical, chemical, and
   biological process in fluvial systems, including hydraulics, transport
   of materials, algal biomass accrual, nutrient uptake, and trophic
   interactions. The processes that deplete wood are thus of broad
   importance to stream ecosystems. We assessed the relative contributions
   for breakage-induced mobilization (where pieces are more prone to
   transport as a result of breakage into shorter parts) and gradual
   biochemical decay to wood depletion rates in a field study on 12
   northern Minnesota, USA, streams. Wood pieces>0.05 m in diameter for a
   portion>1 m in length were individually tagged (n = 651), measured, and
   remeasured a year later. Pieces showed significant reductions in density
   and branching complexity (i.e., branches and twigs) and 22\% of pieces
   broke (i.e., lost 10\% or more of length). Processes related to breakage
   and decay were examined using Bayesian structural equation modeling and
   multiple regression. Breakage was more likely for pieces that were thin
   in diameter, long, deeply submerged, braced, buried, and traveled long
   distances. Pieces lost more density if they were initially dense,
   traveled a long distance, were not deeply submerged, lacked bark, were
   thin in diameter, were steeply pitched, were long, and were not buried.
   Pieces lost more branching complexity if they were complex with little
   gap between them and the streambed. Actual mass losses related to
   breakage and decay were 7.3\% and 1.9\% (respectively), both less than
   the 36\% observed for total fluvial export. In contrast to the
   associations of breakage and decay with structural properties of the
   wood pieces and their position, hydraulic and geomorphic variables
   (stream power, slope, velocity, width) had little effect. (C) 2013

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{172}},
Pages = {{7-12}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{The potential use of multivalent-cation-exchanged Y zeolites as
   selective adsorbents for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from Claus process tail
   gas was examined; previous work suggested Zn(II)Y, Ni(II)Y, and Ga(III)Y
   were chosen as representative candidates. The adsorption energies of H2S
   and other Claus tail gas components (CO, H2O, N-2, and CO2) were
   computed on zeolite cluster models with density functional theory (DFT).
   It was found that these multivalent cation-exchanged zeolites are
   subject to strong adsorption of water. The trend in adsorption energy
   does not change with the cation type and Al distribution, and is similar
   to that on alkali metal exchanged zeolites found in our previous study.
   However, the reason for water selectivity is different for the
   multivalents than for the alkali metal Y's, and this is revealed by
   absolutely localized molecular orbital energy decomposition analysis
   (ALMO EDA). The difference between the adsorption energies of CO and H2S
   on GaY is the largest among all the cation-exchanged Y zeolites we have
   studied so far. Therefore, a two-step process, where the H2S adsorption
   follows the removal of H2O, might be a good strategy for adsorptive
   desulfurization. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A fully sulfonated poly(aryl ether ketone) bearing pendent sulfoalkyl
   groups in the side chain (SNPAEK-100) is synthesized and used as the
   matrix membrane. Two series of composite membranes are obtained by
   introducing epoxy resins (TMBP) and two different curing agents with or
   without sulfonic acid groups (DDS and BDSA). All the membranes are
   investigated in detail as polymer electrolyte membranes. As expected,
   the water uptake, the methanol permeability, and the proton conductivity
   of the crosslinked membranes decrease with increasing epoxy resin
   content. Compared with STD-x membranes (0.101 S cm(-1)-0.233 S cm(-1)),
   the STB-x (0.171 S cm(-1)-0.266 S cm(-1)) membrane series reduce the
   loss of proton conductivity because of the sulfonated curing agent,
   BDSA. Other properties of the composite membranes, such as the
   mechanical properties and the thermal properties are also investigated.
   All the results indicate that the composite membranes based on
   SNPAEK-100 and BDSA are promising membrane candidates for direct
   methanol fuel cells. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with the
   ReaxFF2(SiO)(GSI) potential to model the structure of quartz and
   amorphous silica surfacesw exposed to atomic oxygen. The ReaxFFE
   potential is a reactive force field that was specifically parametrized
   to describe gas surface interactions in silica-oxygen systems (Kulkarni,
   A. D.; et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2012, 117, 258-269). We show that the
   ReaxFF(SiO)(GSI) potential accurately describes the experimentally
   measured bulk structure of quartz and amorphous silica, as well as
   experimentally and computationally characterized surface features for
   these materials. A flux boundary condition is implemented in molecular
   dynamics simulations to model the exposure of silica surfaces to atomic
   oxygen. We find that the types of defects occurring on silica surfaces
   under vacuum and exposed to atomic oxygen at high temperatures are in
   agreement with previous MD simulations and experimental measurements of
   silica surfaces. The ReaxFF2(SiO)(GSI) potential predicts a peroxyl
   defect that has not been observed in previous MD simulations of silica
   surfaces, but has been experimentally identified. Density functional
   theory (DFT) calculations are used to validate the extent to which the
   ReaxFF(SiO)(GSI) potential predicts the structure and binding energy of
   the oxygen molecule on this defect. Through MD simulation and comparison
   with experiment, we identify the chemical surface defects that exist on
   real silica surfaces exposed to atomic oxygen at high temperatures and
   discuss their role in the catalytic recombination of atomic oxygen.}},

Title = {{Microalga propels along vorticity direction in a shear flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Using high-speed digital holographic microscopy and microfluidics, we
   discover that, when encountering fluid flow shear above a threshold,
   unicellular green alga Dunaliella primolecta migrates unambiguously in
   the cross-stream direction that is normal to the plane of shear and
   coincides with the local fluid flow vorticity. The flow shear drives
   motile microalgae to collectively migrate in a thin two-dimensional
   horizontal plane and consequently alters the spatial distribution of
   microalgal cells within a given suspension. This shear-induced algal
   migration differs substantially from periodic rotational motion of
   passive ellipsoids, known as Jeffery orbits, as well as gyrotaxis by
   bottom-heavy swimming microalgae in a shear flow due to the subtle
   interplay between torques generated by gravity and viscous shear. Our
   findings could facilitate mechanistic solutions for modeling planktonic
   thin layers and sustainable cultivation of microalgae for human
   nutrition and bioenergy feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated nano-scale magnetic structures to learn how
   magnetic behaviors differ from what is observed in bulk materials. In
   this study, we have measured the magnetic hysteresis of individual
   multilayered nanowire using a magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The
   nanowires were composed of low-aspect ratio segments of iron-gallium
   (Galfenol, Fe80Ga20) and copper layers. Individual wires were released
   from nano-porous anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) templates and separated
   from other nanowires to avoid significant interactions between nearby
   nanowires. In this experiment, structures with aspects ratios c/a of
   similar to 3 were studied. Different MFM phase magnitudes in response to
   the interaction of magnetic film coated MFM tips and Fe-Ga/Cu nanowire
   were observed as a function of applied external magnetic field (-850 Oe
   < H < 850 Oe). Amplitude differences between bright and dark responses
   in MFM images were used to demonstrate hysteresis. Coercivity measured
   was about 125 Oe, which is almost same as the coercivity value (similar
   to 150 Oe) of a nanowire array measured with a vibrating sample
   magnetometer (VSM). When fields are applied perpendicular to the
   nanowires, the hysteresis loops sheared, indicating that the easy axis
   is along the nanowire axis. Remanence magnetizations of an individual
   nanowire and a nanowire array were compared to demonstrate inter-wire
   magnetostatic dipolar interaction. (C) 2013 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Genes encoding tetracycline resistance and the integrase of Class 1
   integrons were enumerated using quantitative PCR from aerosols collected
   from indoor and outdoor environments. Concentrated animal feeding
   operations (CAFOs) and human-occupied indoor environments (two clinics
   and a homeless shelter) were found to be a source of airborne tet(X) and
   tet(W) genes. The CAFOs had 10- to 100-times higher concentrations of
   airborne 16S rRNA, tet(X), and tet(W) genes than other environments
   sampled, and increased concentrations of aerosolized bacteria correlated
   with increased concentrations of airborne resistance genes. The two
   CAFOs studied had statistically similar concentrations of resistance
   genes in their aerosol samples, even though antibiotic use was markedly
   different between the two operations Additionally, tet(W) genes were
   recovered in outdoor air within 2 km of livestock operations, which
   suggests that antibiotic resistance genes may be transported via
   aerosols on local scales. The integrase gene (intI1) from Class 1
   integrons, which has been associated with multidrug resistance, was
   detected in CAFOs but not in human occupied indoor environments,
   suggesting that CAFO aerosols could serve as a reservoir of multidrug
   resistance. In conclusion, our results show that CAFOs and clinics are
   sources of aerosolized antibiotic resistance genes that can potentially
   be transported via air movement.}},

Abstract = {{The next generation of diesel emission control devices includes 4-way
   catalyzed filtration systems (4WCFS) consisting of both NOx and diesel
   particulate matter (DPM) control. A methodology was developed to
   simultaneously evaluate the NOx and DPM control performance of miniature
   4WCFS made from acicular mullite, an advanced ceramic material (ACM),
   that were challenged with diesel exhaust. The impact of catalyst loading
   and substrate porosity on catalytic performance of the NOx trap was
   evaluated. Simultaneously with NOx measurements, the real-time solid
   particle filtration performance of catalyst-coated standard and high
   porosity filters was determined for steady-state and regenerative
   conditions. The use of high porosity ACM 4-way catalyzed filtration
   systems reduced NOx by 99\% and solid and total particulate matter by
   95\% when averaged over 10 regeneration cycles. A ``regeneration
   cycle{''} refers to an oxidizing ({''}lean{''}) exhaust condition
   followed by a reducing ({''}rich{''}) exhaust condition resulting in NOx
   storage and NOx reduction (i.e., trap ``regeneration{''}), respectively.
   Standard porosity ACM 4-way catalyzed filtration systems reduced NOx by
   60-75\% and exhibited 99.9\% filtration efficiency. The rich/lean
   cycling used to regenerate the filter had almost no impact on solid
   particle filtration efficiency but impacted NOx control. Cycling
   resulted in the formation of very low concentrations of semivolatile
   nucleation mode particles for some 4WCFS formulations. Overall, 4WCFS
   show promise for significantly reducing diesel emissions into the
   atmosphere in a single control device.}},

Abstract = {{Overly doped FeN multilayer structure on GaAs substrate was fabricated.
   After the post-annealing process, FeN martensite in each Fe/FeN layer
   formed partially chemically ordered Fe16N2, which was observed by X-ray
   diffraction. To detect the saturation magnetization (Ms) depth profile,
   polarized neutron reflectivity was conducted. Fe/FeN layer showed a
   significant improvement of Ms for each layer compared to Ms of Fe. More
   importantly, different FeN layers showed different Ms according to the
   physical distance to the substrate GaAs. The most enhanced Ms (exceeding
   the limit of Fe65Co35 Ms) observed at the bottom part of the film,
   consistent with previous reports, should be attributed to the lattice
   strain by GaAs substrate. In order to detect the lattice constant,
   In-plane X-ray Diffraction was done and a large in-plane lattice
   constant was determined. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Bamboo leaves are considered as an important source of bioactive
   molecules. In this work, leaves from young bamboo (Phyllostachys
   pubescens Mazel) aged 3 months were subjected to aqueous extraction and
   2\% NaOH solution extraction followed by precipitation in ethanol-water
   medium with different ethanol concentrations. The dissolved
   hemicellulosic polysaccharides presented a total recovery of 67.83\%
   based on the total hemicellulose content in bamboo leaves. Chemical
   analysis of the fractions was performed by sugar composition analysis,
   Fourier-transform infrared spectrometry, and 1D nuclear magnetic
   resonance imaging. The results revealed that all polysaccharide
   fractions contained xylose, arabinose, glucose, galactose, ribose, and
   uronic acid. The polysaccharides from young bamboo leaves mainly
   consisted of arabinoxylans, arabinogalactans, and non-cellulosic
   beta-D-glucans having (1 -> 3)- and (1 -> 4)-glucosidic linkages. The
   content of these polysaccharides was found to vary among the fractions
   depending on the separation method. Finally, the thermal behavior was
   also discussed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations of DOPC at T = 303 K were performed using the united atom
   force field 43A1-S3 at six fixed projected areas, A(p) = 62, 64, 66, 68,
   70, and 72 angstrom(2), as well as a tensionless simulation that
   produced an average A(NpT) = 65.8 angstrom(2). After a small undulation
   correction for the system size consisting of 288 lipids, results were
   compared to experimental data. The best, and excellent, fit to neutron
   scattering data occurs at an interpolated A(N) = 66.6 angstrom(2) and
   the best, but not as good, fit to the more extensive X-ray scattering
   data occurs at A(X) = 68.7 angstrom(2). The distance Delta DB-H between
   the Gibbs dividing surface for water and the peak in the electron
   density profile agrees with scattering experiments The calculated area
   compressibility K = 277 +/- 10 mN/m is in excellent agreement with the
   micromechanical experiment. The volume per lipid V-L is smaller than
   volume experiments which suggests a workaround that raises all the areas
   by about 1.5\%. Although A(X) not equal A(N) not equal A(NpT), this
   force field obtains acceptable agreement with experiment for A(L) = 67.5
   angstrom(2) (68.5 angstrom(2) in the workaround), which we suggest is a
   better DOPC result from 43A1-S3 simulations than its value from the
   tensionless NPT simulation. However, nonsimulation modeling, obtains
   better simultaneous fits to both kinds of scattering data, which
   suggests that the force fields can still be. improved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes a general class of stationary trajectories for deep
   boreholes drilled using rotary systems. These solutions correspond to
   helical wells twisting around a vertical axis, which can degenerate into
   straight or circular boreholes; they arise when the forces acting on the
   bit, and thus the penetrations of the bit into the rock, are invariant
   in a basis attached to the bit. Under these stationary conditions, the
   deformed configuration of the bottomhole assembly (the lower part of the
   drillstring) is also invariant. The paper formulates the equations
   governing these equilibrium solutions from considerations involving the
   interaction between the bit and the rock, but also between the
   bottomhole assembly and the borehole through the contact points at the
   stabilizers and at the rotary steerable system (the tool used to steer
   the bit). It is shown that the stationary solutions are completely
   defined by four parameters characterizing the geometry of the wellbore:
   two at the scale of the bottomhole assembly (the curvature and
   inclination of the helical axis), and two at the scale of the bit (the
   bit tilts, proxies for the borehole diameter). The key dimensionless
   parameters that control the directional response of the drilling system
   are finally identified, as well as the critical values of some
   parameters at which a pathological change in the response takes place.

Abstract = {{The redox chemistry of nonstoichiometric metal oxides can be used to
   produce chemical fuels by harnessing concentrated solar energy to split
   water and/or carbon dioxide. In such a process, it is desirable to use a
   porous reactive substrate for increased surface area and improved gas
   transport. The present study develops a macroscopic-scale model of
   porous ceria undergoing thermal reduction. The model captures the
   coupled interactions between the heat and mass transfer and the
   heterogeneous chemistry using a local thermal nonequilibrium (LTNE)
   formulation of the volume-averaged conservation of mass and energy
   equations in an axisymmetric cylindrical domain. The results of a
   representative test case simulation demonstrate strong coupling between
   gas phase mass transfer and the chemical kinetics as well as the
   pronounced impact of optical thickness on the temperature distribution
   and thus global solar-to-chemical energy conversion.}},

Abstract = {{Sediment pore-water dissolved organic matter (DOM) in two North Dakota
   prairie pothole lakes was quantified by dissolved organic carbon
   analysis (DOC) and its composition was characterized as a function of
   sediment depth for molecular weight distribution (MWD), molar
   absorptivity at 280 nm (epsilon 280), and fluorescence properties.
   Fluorescence excitation emission matrices were further analyzed by
   creating a Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC) model specific to
   sedimentary pore-water DOM. The range of absolute pore-water DOC
   concentrations (similar to 26-183 mg C L-1) greatly exceeded abundances
   reported for other wetlands and generally increased with depth.
   Significant changes occurred in epsilon 280 and fluorescence seasonally.
   Prairie pothole pore-water DOM is primarily allochthonous in nature and
   three `humic-like' components explained similar to 90\% of total sample
   fluorescence, while a single `non-humic' component was responsible for
   the remaining 10\%. The contribution of the non-humic component,
   however, was more significant in the top 7 cm of sediment in samples
   collected in early autumn and is presumably derived from algal precursor
   material produced by primary production in the water column over the
   summer. The PARAFAC results corroborate epsilon 280 and MWD changes in
   pore-water DOM composition over the growing season. This dynamic process
   could affect the type of DOM available for biogeochemical processes
   seasonally.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Deregulation of energy markets, penetration of renewables, advanced
   metering capabilities, and the urge for situational awareness, all call
   for system-wide power system state estimation (PSSE). Implementing a
   centralized estimator though is practically infeasible due to the
   complexity scale of an interconnection, the communication bottleneck in
   real-time monitoring, regional disclosure policies, and reliability
   issues. In this context, distributed PSSE methods are treated here under
   a unified and systematic framework. A novel algorithm is developed based
   on the alternating direction method of multipliers. It leverages
   existing PSSE solvers, respects privacy policies, exhibits low
   communication load, and its convergence to the centralized estimates is
   guaranteed even in the absence of local observability. Beyond the
   conventional least-squares based PSSE, the decentralized framework
   accommodates a robust state estimator. By exploiting interesting links
   to the compressive sampling advances, the latter jointly estimates the
   state and identifies corrupted measurements. The novel algorithms are
   numerically evaluated using the IEEE 14-, 118-bus, and a 4200-bus
   benchmarks. Simulations demonstrate that the attainable accuracy can be
   reached within a few inter-area exchanges, while largest residual tests
   are outperformed.}},

Abstract = {{Activatable photoacoustic probes efficiently combine the high spatial
   resolution and penetration depth of ultrasound with the high optical
   contrast and versatility of molecular imaging agents. Our approach is
   based on photoacoustic probing of the excited-state lifetime of
   methylene blue (MB), a fluorophore widely used in clinical therapeutic
   and diagnostic applications. Upon aggregation, static quenching between
   the bound molecules dramatically shortens their lifetime by three orders
   of magnitude. We present preliminary results demonstrating the ability
   of photoacoustic imaging to probe the lifetime contrast between monomers
   and dimers with high sensitivity in cylindrical phantoms. Gradual
   dimerization enhancement, driven by the addition of increasing
   concentrations of sodium sulfate to a MB solution, showed that
   lifetime-based photoacoustic probing decreases linearly with monomer
   concentration. Similarly, the addition of 4 mM sodium dodecyl sulfate, a
   concentration that amplifies MB aggregation and reduces the monomer
   concentration by more than 20-fold, led to a signal decrease of more
   than 20 dB compared to a solution free of surfactant. These results
   suggest that photoacoustic imaging can be used to selectively detect the
   presence of monomers. We conclude by discussing the implementation of
   the monomer-dimer contrast mechanism for the development of an
   enzyme-specific activatable probe. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{We present a methodology for implementing discrete-time signal
   processing operations, such as filtering, with molecular reactions. The
   reactions produce time-varying output quantities of molecules as a
   function of time-varying input quantities according to a functional
   specification. This computation is robust and independent of the
   reaction rates, provided that the rate constants fall within coarse
   categories. We describe two approaches: one entails synchronization with
   a clock signal, implemented through sustained chemical oscillations; the
   other is self-timed or asynchronous. We illustrate the methodology by
   synthesizing a simple moving-average filter, a biquad filter, and a Fast
   Fourier Transform (FFT). Abstract molecular reactions for these filters
   and transforms are translated into DNA strand displacement reactions.
   The computation is validated through mass-action simulations of the DNA
   kinetics. Although a proof of concept for the time being, molecular
   filters and transforms have potential applications in fields such as
   biochemical sensing and drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded flash memory implemented using standard I/O devices can open
   doors to new applications and system capabilities, as it can serve as a

   logic processes. For example, it is indispensable for adaptive
   self-healing techniques targeted for mitigating process variation and
   circuit aging related issues where system information must be retained
   during power down periods. Embedded non-volatile memory can also enable
   zero-standby power systems by allowing them to completely power down
   without losing critical data. There has been numerous device and circuit
   level research on high-density non-volatile memories such as flash,
   STT-MRAM, PRAM, and RRAM. However, only few attempts have been made to
   develop a cost effective moderate-density non-volatile solution using
   standard I/O devices. In this paper, a logic-compatible embedded flash
   memory that uses no special devices other than standard core and I/O
   transistors is demonstrated in a generic logic process having a 5 nm

Abstract = {{The problem of coordinating a fleet of vehicles so that all demand
   points on a territory are serviced and the workload is most evenly
   distributed among the vehicles is a hard one. For this reason, it is
   often an effective strategy to first divide the service region and
   impose that each vehicle is only responsible for its own subregion. This
   heuristic also has the practical advantage that over time, drivers
   become more effective at serving their territory and customers. In this
   paper, we assume that client locations are unknown at the time of
   partitioning the territory and that each of them will be drawn
   identically and independently according to a distribution that is
   actually also unknown. In practice, it might be impossible to identify
   precisely the distribution if, for instance, information about the
   demand is limited to historical data. Our approach Suggests partitioning
   the region with respect to the worst-case distribution that satisfies
   first- and second-order moments information. As a side product, our
   analysis constructs for each subregion a closed-form expression for the
   worst-case density function, thus providing useful insights about what
   affects the completion time most heavily. The successful implementation
   of our approach relies on two branch-and-bound algorithms: whereas the
   first finds a globally optimal partition of a convex polygon into two
   convex subregions, the second finds a local optimum for the harder
   n-partitioning problem. Finally, simulations of a parcel delivery
   problem will demonstrate that our data-driven approach makes better use
   of historical data as it becomes available.}},

   Models Exploiting Genetic Perturbations}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Integrating genetic perturbations with gene expression data not only
   improves accuracy of regulatory network topology inference, but also
   enables learning of causal regulatory relations between genes. Although
   a number of methods have been developed to integrate both types of data,
   the desiderata of efficient and powerful algorithms still remains. In
   this paper, sparse structural equation models (SEMs) are employed to
   integrate both gene expression data and cis-expression quantitative
   trait loci (cis-eQTL), for modeling gene regulatory networks in
   accordance with biological evidence about genes regulating or being
   regulated by a small number of genes. A systematic inference method
   named sparsity-aware maximum likelihood (SML) is developed for SEM
   estimation. Using simulated directed acyclic or cyclic networks, the SML
   performance is compared with that of two state-of-the-art algorithms:
   the adaptive Lasso (AL) based scheme, and the QTL-directed dependency
   graph (QDG) method. Computer simulations demonstrate that the novel SML
   algorithm offers significantly better performance than the AL-based and
   QDG algorithms across all sample sizes from 100 to 1,000, in terms of
   detection power and false discovery rate, in all the cases tested that
   include acyclic or cyclic networks of 10, 30 and 300 genes. The SML
   method is further applied to infer a network of 39 human genes that are
   related to the immune function and are chosen to have a reliable eQTL
   per gene. The resulting network consists of 9 genes and 13 edges. Most
   of the edges represent interactions reasonably expected from
   experimental evidence, while the remaining may just indicate the
   emergence of new interactions. The sparse SEM and efficient SML
   algorithm provide an effective means of exploiting both gene expression
   and perturbation data to infer gene regulatory networks. An open-source
   computer program implementing the SML algorithm is freely available upon

Abstract = {{Despite rapid recent progress, controlled dopant incorporation and
   attainment of high mobility in thin films of the prototypical complex
   oxide semiconductor SrTiO3 remain problematic. Here, analytical scanning
   transmission electron microscopy is used to study the local atomic and
   electronic structure of Nb-doped SrTiO3 both in ideally substitutionally
   doped bulk single crystals and epitaxial thin films. The films are
   deposited under conditions that would yield highly stoichiometric
   undoped SrTiO3, but are nevertheless insulating. The Nb incorporation in
   such films was found to be highly inhomogeneous on nanoscopic
   length-scales, with large quantities of what we deduce to be
   interstitial Nb. Electron energy loss spectroscopy reveals changes in
   the electronic density of states in Nb-doped SrTiO3 films compared to
   undoped SrTiO3, but without the clear shift in the Fermi edge seen in
   bulk single crystal Nb-doped SrTiO3. Analysis of atomic-resolution
   annular dark-field images allows us to conclude that the interstitial Nb
   is in the Nb state, confirming that it is electrically inactive. We
   argue that this approach should enable future work establishing the
   vitally needed relationships between synthesis/processing conditions and
   electronic properties of Nb-doped SrTiO3 thin}},

   mechanical strengths for specimens exposed to temperatures up to 250
   degrees C. Per contra, significant damage was observed for higher

   that of ordinary concrete made with similar aggregates. Based on X-ray

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},

Pages = {{86-91}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The goals of this study were to determine if the muscle contributions to
   vertical and fore-aft acceleration of the mass center differ between
   crouch gait and unimpaired gait and if these muscle contributions change
   with crouch severity. Examining muscle contributions to mass center
   acceleration provides insight into the roles of individual muscles
   during gait and can provide guidance for treatment planning. We
   calculated vertical and fore-aft accelerations using musculoskeletal
   simulations of typically developing children and children with cerebral
   palsy and crouch gait. Analysis of these simulations revealed that
   during unimpaired gait the quadriceps produce large upward and backward
   accelerations during early stance, whereas the ankle plantarflexors
   produce large upward and forward accelerations later in stance. In
   contrast, during crouch gait, the quadriceps and ankle plantarflexors
   produce large, opposing fore-aft accelerations throughout stance. The
   quadriceps force required to accelerate the mass center upward was
   significantly larger in crouch gait than in unimpaired gait and
   increased with crouch severity. The gluteus medius accelerated the mass
   center upward during midstance in unimpaired gait; however, during
   crouch gait the upward acceleration produced by the gluteus medius was
   significantly reduced. During unimpaired gait the quadriceps and ankle
   plantarflexors accelerate the mass center at different times,
   efficiently modulating fore-aft accelerations. However, during crouch
   gait, the quadriceps and ankle plantarflexors produce fore-aft
   accelerations at the same time and the opposing fore-aft accelerations
   generated by these muscles contribute to the inefficiency of crouch
   gait. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ACS MACRO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{451-455}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The mechanism of chain exchange in block polymer micelles at equilibrium
   is investigated using time-resolved small-angle neutron scattering
   (TR-SANS). The binary micelles are formed from blends of two
   poly(styrene-b-ethylene-alt-propylene) (PS-PEP) copolymers with
   different PS core block lengths, only one of which is contrast-matched
   with the solvent, squalane, so that the monitored scattering intensity
   only reflects the other species. Micelles prepared with an excess of
   deuterated PS chains (of the visible species) and those with the
   equivalent protonated PS chains are blended ({''}postmixed{''}) at room
   temperature, where the exchange of chains is suppressed. At several
   elevated temperatures these samples were monitored by TR-SANS, in which
   mixing of isotope-labeled visible species gives systematic reduction of
   scattering signals with time and provides a quantitative-way to
   characterize the micelle exchange kinetics. Within experimental error,
   the results for each labeled chain (i.e., longer or shorter) in the
   binary micelles are identical to. those recently reported for the same
   labeled chains in the corresponding single block copolymer component
   micelles, thus proving that chain exchange in these micelles involves
   independent chain motion. This reinforces the important conclusions that
   the single-chain exchange mechanism dominates in the studied micelle
   solutions and that micelle fusion or fission events are rare.}},

   intermediate 3DOm carbon templates, and the correlations among the
   confined synthesis methods, crystal growth nature of different zeolites,
   and the sintering of the templates were studied. An imperfect
   replication was found in 3DOm-i zeolite when it compared to silica
   colloidal crystals regardless the synthesis methods (MHT or SAC), which
   might be originated from combination effects of sintering of the silica
   colloidal crystals and partial filling of cavities of the 3DOm carbon
   template during the confined synthesis, and the degree of the structure
   replication was notably influenced by microstructures of zeolite as
   well. A thorough investigation of the growth development of 3DOm-i BEA
   zeolites with various Si/Al ratios ranging from 14 to 27 through the MHT
   method confirmed that the crystallization takes place in the carbon
   template by a cage-to-cage propagation growth process.}},

Abstract = {{Phase response curves (PRCs) are a simple model of how a neuron's spike
   time is affected by synaptic inputs. PRCs are useful in predicting how
   networks of neurons behave when connected. One challenge in estimating a
   neuron's PRCs experimentally is that many neurons do not have stationary
   firing rates. In this article we introduce a new method to estimate PRCs
   as a function of firing rate of the neuron. We call the resulting model
   a parameterized PRC (pPRC). Experimentally, we perturb the neuron
   applying a current with two parts: 1) a current held constant between
   spikes but changed at the onset of a spike, used to make the neuron fire
   at different rates, and 2) a pulse to emulate a synaptic input. A model
   of the applied constant current and the history is made to predict the
   interspike interval (ISI). A second model is then made to fit the
   modulation of the spike time from the expected ISI by the pulsatile
   stimulus. A polynomial with two independent variables, the stimulus
   phase and the expected ISI, is used to model the pPRC. The pPRC is
   validated in a computational model and applied to pyramidal neurons from
   the CA1 region of the hippocampal slices from rat. The pPRC can be used
   to model the effect of changing firing rates on network synchrony. It
   can also be used to characterize the effects of neuro-modulators and
   genetic mutations (among other manipulations) on network synchrony. It
   can also easily be extended to account for more variables.}},

Abstract = {{Surgery, radiation and chemotherapy remain the mainstay of current
   cancer therapy. However, treatment failure persists due to the inability
   to achieve complete local control of the tumor and curtail metastatic
   spread. Vascular disrupting agents (VDAs) are a class of promising
   systemic agents that are known to synergistically enhance radiation,
   chemotherapy or thermal treatments of solid tumors. Unfortunately, there
   is still an unmet need for VDAs with more favorable safety profiles and
   fewer side effects. Recent work has demonstrated that conjugating VDAs
   to other molecules (polyethylene glycol, CNGRCG peptide) or
   nanoparticles (liposomes, gold) can reduce toxicity of one prominent VDA
   (tumor necrosis factor alpha, TNF-alpha). In this report, we show the
   potential of a gold conjugated TNF-alpha nanoparticle (NP-TNF) to
   improve multimodal cancer therapies with VDAs. In a dorsal skin fold and
   hindlimb murine xenograft model of prostate cancer, we found that NP-TNF
   disrupts endothelial barrier function and induces a significant increase
   in vascular permeability within the first 1-2 h followed by a dramatic
   80\% drop in perfusion 2-6 h after systemic administration. We also
   demonstrate that the tumor response to the nanoparticle can be verified
   using dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a
   technique in clinical use. Additionally, multimodal treatment with
   thermal therapies at the perfusion nadir in the sub- and
   supraphysiological temperature regimes increases tumor volumetric
   destruction by over 60\% and leads to significant tumor growth delays
   compared to thermal therapy alone. Lastly, NP-TNF was found to enhance
   thermal therapy in the absence of neutrophil recruitment, suggesting
   that immune/inflammatory regulation is not central to its power as part
   of a multimodal approach. Our data demonstrate the potential of
   nanoparticle-conjugated VDAs to significantly improve cancer therapy by
   preconditioning tumor vasculature to a secondary insult in a targeted
   manner. We anticipate our work to direct investigations into more potent
   tumor vasculature specific combinations of VDAs and nanoparticles with
   the goal of transitioning optimal regimens into clinical trials.}},

Abstract = {{Background. Gold standards of data analysis for single-case research do
   not currently exist.
   Objective. The purpose of this study was to determine whether a combined
   statistical analysis method is more effective in assessing movement
   training effects in a patient with cerebellar stroke.
   Design. A crossover single-case research design was conducted.
   Methods. The patient was a 69-year-old man with a chronic cerebellar
   infarct who received two 5-week phases of finger tracking training at
   different movement rates. Changes were measured with the Box and Block
   Test, the Jebson-Taylor test, the finger extension force test, and the
   corticospinal excitability test. Both visual analysis and statistical
   tests (including split-middle line method, t test, confidence interval,
   and effect size) were used to assess potential intervention effects.
   Results. The results of the t tests were highly consistent with the
   confidence interval tests, but less consistent with the split-middle
   line method. Most results produced medium to large effect sizes.
   Limitations. The possibility of an incomplete washout effect was a
   confounding factor in the current analyses.
   Conclusions. The combined statistical analysis method may assist
   researchers in assessing intervention effects in single-case stroke
   rehabilitation studies.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new implicit computational fluid dynamics method for
   steady-state compressible reacting flows. The concept is to decouple the
   total mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations from the species
   mass and internal energy equations and to solve the two equation sets
   sequentially. With certain approximations to the implicit system, it is
   possible to dramatically reduce the cost of the solution with little to
   no penalty on the convergence properties. Importantly, the cost of the
   decoupled implicit problem scales linearly with the number of species,
   as opposed to the quadratic scaling for the conventional fully coupled
   method. Furthermore, the new approach reduces the memory requirements by
   a significant factor. The decoupled implicit method shows promise for
   the application to aerothermodynamics problems and reacting flows.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes have recently emerged as one of the most favorable
   capacityachieving error correction codes due to their low encoding and
   decoding complexity. However, because of the large code length required
   by practical applications, the few existing successive cancellation (SC)
   decoder implementations still suffer from not only high hardware cost
   but also long decoding latency. In this paper, a data-flow graph (DFG)
   for the SC decoder is derived. A complete hardware architecture is first
   derived for the conventional tree SC decoder and the feedback part is
   presented next. Pre-computation look-ahead technique is exploited to
   reduce the achievable minimum decoding latency. Substructure sharing is
   used to design a merged processing element (PE) for higher hardware
   utilization. In order to meet throughput requirements for a diverse set
   of application scenarios, a systematic approach to construct different
   overlapped SC polar decoder architectures is also presented. Compared
   with a conventional N-bit tree SC decoder, the proposed overlapped
   architectures can achieve as high as (N - 1) times speedup with only (N
   log(2) N)/2 merged PEs. The proposed pre-computation approach leads to a
   50\% reduction in latency for N > 2(7), and 40\% reduction for N <=
   2(7).}},

Abstract = {{Multicast beamforming exploits subscriber channel state information at
   the base station to steer the transmission power towards the
   subscribers, while minimizing interference to other users and systems.
   Such functionality has been provisioned in the long-term evolution (LTE)
   enhanced multimedia broadcast multicast service (EMBMS). As antennas
   become smaller and cheaper relative to up-conversion chains, transmit
   antenna selection at the base station becomes increasingly appealing in
   this context. This paper addresses the problem of joint multicast
   beamforming and antenna selection for multiple co-channel multicast
   groups. Whereas this problem (and even plain multicast beamforming) is
   NP-hard, it is shown that the mixed l(1,infinity)-norm squared is a
   prudent group-sparsity inducing convex regularization, in that it
   naturally yields a suitable semidefinite relaxation, which is further
   shown to be the Lagrange bi-dual of the original NP-hard problem.
   Careful simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm significantly
   reduces the number of antennas required to meet prescribed service
   levels, at relatively small excess transmission power. Furthermore, its
   performance is close to that attained by exhaustive search, at far lower
   complexity. Extensions to max-min-fair, robust, and capacity-achieving
   designs are also considered.}},

Abstract = {{Wideband spectrum sensing is a key requirement for cognitive radio
   access. It now appears increasingly likely that spectrum sensing will be
   performed using networks of sensors, or crowd-sourced to handheld mobile
   devices. Here, a network sensing scenario is considered, where scattered
   low-end sensors filter and measure the average signal power across a
   band of interest, and each sensor communicates a single bit (or coarsely
   quantized level) to a fusion center, depending on whether its
   measurement is above a certain threshold. The focus is on the
   underdetermined case, where relatively few bits are available at the
   fusion center. Exploiting non-negativity and the linear relationship
   between the power spectrum and the autocorrelation, it is shown that
   adequate power spectrum sensing is possible from few bits, even for
   dense spectra. The formulation can be viewed as generalizing classical
   nonparametric power spectrum estimation to the case where the data is in
   the form of inequalities, rather than equalities.}},

Abstract = {{Common spatial pattern (CSP) method is widely used in brain machine
   interface (BMI) applications to extract features from the multichannel
   neural activity through a set of spatial projections. These spatial
   projections minimize the Rayleigh quotient (RQ) as the objective
   function, which is the variance ratio of the classes. The CSP method
   easily overfits the data when the number of training trials is not
   sufficiently large and it is sensitive to daily variation of
   multichannel electrode placement, which limits its applicability for
   everyday use in BMI systems. To overcome these problems, the amount of
   channels that is used in projections, should be limited to some adequate
   number. We introduce a spatially sparse projection (SSP) method that
   exploits the unconstrained minimization of a new objective function with
   approximated l(1) penalty. Unlike the RQ this new objective function
   depends on the magnitude of the sparse filter. The SSP method is
   employed to classify the multiclass ECoG and two class EEG data sets. We
   compared our results with a recently introduced sparse CSP solution
   based on l(0) norm. Our method outperforms the standard CSP method and
   provides comparable results to l(0) norm based solution and it is
   associated with less computational complexity. We also conducted several
   simulation studies on the effect of noisy channel and intersession
   variability on the performance of the CSP and sparse filters. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Hybrid imaging modality combining ultrasound scanning and electrical
   current density imaging through the acoustoelectric (AE) effect may
   potentially provide solutions to imaging electrical activities and
   properties of biological tissues with high spatial resolution. In this
   study, a 3-D reconstruction solution to ultrasound current source
   density imaging (UCSDI) by means of Wiener deconvolution is proposed and
   evaluated through computer simulations. As compared to previous 2-D
   UCSDI problem, in a 3-D volume conductor with broadly distributed
   current density field, the AE signal becomes a 3-D convolution between
   the electric field and the acoustic field, and effective 3-D
   reconstruction algorithm has not been developed so far. In the proposed
   method, a 3-D ultrasound scanning is performed while the corresponding
   AE signals are collected from multiple electrode pairs attached on the
   surface of the imaging object. From the collected AE signals, the
   acoustic field and electric field were first decoupled by Wiener
   deconvolution. Then, the current density distribution was reconstructed
   by inverse projection. Our simulations using artificial current fields
   in homogeneous phantoms suggest that the proposed method is feasible and
   robust against noise. It is also shown that using the proposed method,
   it is feasible to reconstruct 3-D current density distribution in an
   inhomogeneous conductive medium.}},

Abstract = {{The electric properties of biological tissue provide important
   diagnostic information within radio and microwave frequencies, and also
   play an important role in specific absorption rate calculation which is
   a major safety concern at ultrahigh field. The recently proposed
   electrical properties tomography (EPT) technique aims to reconstruct
   electric properties in biological tissues based on B1 measurement.
   However, for individual coil element in multichannel transceiver coil
   which is increasingly utilized at ultrahigh field, current B1-mapping
   techniques could not provide adequate information (magnitude and
   absolute phase) of complex transmit and receive B1 which are essential
   for electrical properties tomography, electric field, and quantitative
   specific absorption rate assessment. In this study, using a 16-channel
   transceiver coil at 7T, based on hybrid B1-mapping techniques within the
   human brain, a complex B1-mapping method has been developed, and in vivo
   electric properties imaging of the human brain has been demonstrated by
   applying a logarithm-based inverse algorithm. Computer simulation
   studies as well as phantom and human experiments have been conducted at
   7T. The average bias and standard deviation for reconstructed
   conductivity in vivo were 28\% and 67\%, and 10\% and 43\% for relative
   permittivity, respectively. The present results suggest the feasibility
   and reliability of proposed complex B1-mapping technique and electric

Abstract = {{Human brains are highly convoluted surfaces with multiple folds. To
   characterize the complexity of these folds and their relationship with
   neurological and psychiatric conditions, different techniques have been
   developed to quantify the folding patterns, also known as the surface
   complexity or gyrification of the brain. In this study, the authors
   propose a new geometric approach to measure the gyrification of human
   brains from magnetic resonance images. This approach is based on
   intrinsic 3D measurements that relate the local brain surface area to
   the corresponding area of a tightly wrapped sheet. The authors also
   present an adaptation of this technique in which the geodesic depth is
   incorporated into the gyrification computation. These gyrification
   measures are efficiently and accurately computed by solving geometric
   partial differential equations. The presentation of the geometric
   framework is complemented with experimental results for brain complexity
   in typically developing children and adolescents. Using this novel
   approach, the authors provide evidence for a gradual decrease in brain
   surface complexity throughout childhood and adolescence. These
   developmental differences occur earlier in the occipital lobe and move
   anterior as children progress into young adulthood. Hum Brain Mapp,

Abstract = {{Amplification of deterministic disturbances in inertialess shear-driven
   channel flows of viscoelastic fluids is examined by analysing the
   frequency responses from spatio-temporal body forces to the velocity and
   polymer stress fluctuations. In strongly elastic flows, we show that
   disturbances with large streamwise length scales may be significantly
   amplified even in the absence of inertia. For fluctuations without
   streamwise variations, we derive explicit analytical expressions for the
   dependence of the worst-case amplification (from different forcing to
   different velocity and polymer stress components) on the Weissenberg
   number (We), the maximum extensibility of the polymer chains (L), the
   viscosity ratio and the spanwise wavenumber. For the Oldroyd-B model,
   the amplification of the most energetic components of velocity and
   polymer stress fields scales as We(2) and We(4). On the other hand, the
   finite extensibility of polymer molecules limits the largest achievable
   amplification even in flows with infinitely large Weissenberg numbers:
   in the presence of wall-normal and spanwise forces, the amplification of
   the streamwise velocity and polymer stress fluctuations is bounded by
   quadratic and quartic functions of L. This high amplification signals
   low robustness to modelling imperfections of inertialess channel flows
   of viscoelastic fluids. The underlying physical mechanism involves
   interactions of polymer stress fluctuations with a base shear, and it
   represents a close analogue of the lift-up mechanism that initiates a
   bypass transition in inertial flows of Newtonian fluids.}},

Abstract = {{Across the U.S. Upper Midwest, a natural geographical sulfate gradient
   exists in lakes. Sediment grab samples and cores were taken to explore
   whether this sulfur gradient impacted organohalide-respiring Chloroflexi
   in lake sediments. Putative organohalide-respiring Chloroflexi were
   detected in 67 of 68 samples by quantitative polymerase chain reaction.
   Their quantities ranged from 3.5x104 to 8.4x1010 copies 16S rRNA genes
   g1 dry sediment and increased in number from west to east, whereas lake
   sulfate concentrations decreased along this west-to-east transect. A
   terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) method was
   used to corroborate this inverse relationship, with sediment samples
   from lower sulfate lakes containing both a higher number of terminal
   restriction fragments (TRFs) belonging to the organohalide-respiring
   Dehalococcoidetes, and a greater percentage of the TRFLP amplification
   made up by Dehalococcoidetes members. Statistical analyses showed that
   dissolved sulfur in the porewater, measured as sulfate after oxidation,
   appeared to have a negative impact on the total number of putative
   organohalide-respiring Chloroflexi, the number of Dehalococcoidetes
   TRFs, and the percentage of the TRFLP amplification made up by
   Dehalococcoidetes. These findings point to dissolved sulfur, presumably
   present as reduced sulfur species, as a potentially controlling factor
   in the natural cycling of chlorine, and perhaps as a result, the natural
   cycling of some carbon as well.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, single-carrier (SC) communication for intersymbol
   interference (ISI) channels has enjoyed a revived interest. Its
   principal advantage over the multi-carrier scheme is its lower
   peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). In this paper, we propose a new fast
   iterative algorithm to obtain the optimal finite impulse response (FIR)
   minimum-mean-square-error decision feedback equalizer (MMSE-DFE) for
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) SC communication systems over ISI
   channels based on the QR decomposition of an augmented Toeplitz channel
   matrix. The proposed algorithm is not only computationally efficient but
   also very frugal in its memory usage. The algorithm applies to MIMO
   systems with any number of transmitting and receiving antennas, either
   balanced or unbalanced. The iterative nature of the proposed algorithm
   enables a flexible choice of, the length of the feed forward filter
   (FFF), which leads to a controllable trade-off between complexity and
   performance. A conversion from time-domain equalization (TDE) to a
   hybrid DFE (HDFE) can be used to achieve lower complexity when N-f
   becomes large. Complexity analysis suggests a significant improvement
   over the prior art of TDE.}},

Abstract = {{Consider the max-min fairness linear transceiver design problem for a
   multi-user multi-input multi-output (MIMO) interference channel. When
   the channel knowledge is perfectly known, this problem can be formulated
   as the maximization of the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise
   ratio (SINR) utility, subject to individual power constraints at each
   transmitter. We prove in this paper that, if the number of antennas is
   at least two at each transmitter (receiver) and is at least three at
   each receiver (transmitter), the max-min fairness linear transceiver
   design problem is computationally intractable as the number of users
   becomes large. In fact, even the problem of checking the feasibility of
   a given set of target SINR levels is strongly NP-hard. We then propose
   two iterative algorithms to solve the max-min fairness linear
   transceiver design problem. The transceivers generated by these
   algorithms monotonically improve the min-rate utility and are guaranteed
   to converge to a stationary solution. The efficiency and performance of
   the proposed algorithms compare favorably with solutions obtained from
   the channel matched beamforming or the leakage interference
   minimization.}},

Title = {{Constant pressure hydraulic energy storage through a variable area
   piston hydraulic accumulator}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{262-270}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Hydraulic accumulators are used in a variety of applications to minimize
   the pressure variation in hydraulic circuits and to store energy.
   Conventional hydraulic accumulators suffer from two major limitations,
   the hydraulic system pressure varies with the quantity of energy stored
   and the energy density is significantly lower than other energy domains.
   In this paper, a novel hydraulic accumulator is presented that uses a
   piston with an area that varies with stroke to maintain a constant
   hydraulic system pressure while the gas pressure changes. The variable
   area piston is sealed with a fabric reinforced rolling diaphragm. In
   this work, the piston radius profile is developed as a function of the
   piston displacement and then transformed into a function of the axial
   contact location between the piston and the diaphragm. The piston
   profile was solved numerically for a variety of conditions using both
   transformation methods to illustrate the geometric design trade-offs.
   Using a variable area gas piston with a fixed cylinder area, the maximum
   gas volume ratio was 1.8:1. An analysis of the energy density revealed
   that the constant pressure accumulator provides a 16\% improvement in
   energy density over a conventional accumulator at a volume ratio of
   2.71:1 and also exceeds the maximum energy density of a conventional
   accumulator at the lower volume ratio of 1.8:1. This new promising
   technology maintains a constant hydraulic system pressure independent of
   the quantity of energy stored, easing system control and allowing other
   circuit components to be downsized to meet the same power requirements,
   while also increases the energy storage density. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Research on compiler techniques for thread-level loop speculation has so
   far remained on studying its performance limits: loop candidates that
   are worthy of parallelization are manually selected by the researchers
   or based on extensive profiling and preexecution. It is therefore
   difficult to include them in a production compiler for speculative
   multithreaded multicore processors. In a way, existing techniques are
   statically adaptive ({''}realized{''} by the researchers for different
   inputs) yet dynamically greedy (since all iterations of all selected
   loop candidates are always parallelized at run time). This paper
   introduces a Statically GrEEdy and Dynamically Adaptive (SEED) approach
   for thread-level speculation on loops that is quite different from most
   other existing techniques. SEED relies on the compiler to select and
   optimize loop candidates greedily (possibly in an input-independent way)
   and provides a runtime scheduler to schedule loop iterations adaptively.
   To select loops for parallelization at runtime (subject to program
   inputs), loop iterations are prioritized in terms of their potential
   benefits rather than their degree of speculation as in many prior
   studies. In our current implementation, the benefits of speculative
   threads are estimated by a simple yet effective cost model. It comprises
   a mechanism for efficiently tracing the loop nesting structures of the
   program and a mechanism for predicting the outcome of speculative
   threads. We have evaluated SEED using a set of SPECint2000 and Olden
   benchmarks. Compared to existing techniques with a program's loop
   candidates being ideally selected a priori, SEED can achieve comparable
   or better performance while aututomating the entire loop candidate
   selection process.}},

   employing the Cauchy-Born rule. In this analysis the graphene sheet is

Abstract = {{Mechanical forces play an important role in shaping the organization of

   a rotating silicone tube. We show the fibroblasts proliferated to create
   a confluent monolayer around the tube and a collagenous, isotropic
   tubular tissue over 4 weeks of static culture. These silicone tubes with
   overlying tubular tissue constructs were mounted into a cyclic
   distension bioreactor and subjected to cyclic circumferential stretch at
   5\% strain, 0.5 Hz for 3 weeks. We found that the tissue subjected to
   cyclic stretch compacted axially over the silicone tube in comparison to
   static controls, leading to a circumferentially aligned tissue with
   higher membrane stiffness and maximum tension. In a subsequent study,
   the tissue constructs were constrained against axial compaction during
   cyclic stretching. The resulting alignment of fibroblasts and collagen
   was perpendicular (axial) to the stretch direction (circumferential).
   When the cells were devitalized with sodium azide before stretching,
   similarly constrained tissue did not develop strong axial alignment.
   This work suggests that both mechanical stretching and mechanical
   constraints are important in determining tissue organization, and that
   this organization is dependent on an intact cytoskeleton.}},

   applications. Furthermore, we provide a method where the higher mode
   participation is reconstructed with high fidelity, and present a scheme
   for high bandwidth detection of higher modes when their participation
   becomes significant. These methods are shown to outperform the
   traditional amplitude-phase demodulation schemes in terms of speed,
   resolution, and fidelity. The framework developed is tested on
   simulations and the method's utility for first two modes is demonstrated

Abstract = {{Over the past 20 years, molecular simulation methods have been applied
   to the modeling of reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC). The
   purpose of these simulations was to provide a molecular-level
   understanding of: (i) the structure and dynamics of the bonded phase and
   its interface with the mobile phase, (ii) the interactions of analytes
   with the bonded phase, and (iii) the retention mechanism for different
   analytes. However, the investigation of chromatographic systems poses
   significant challenges for simulations with respect to the accuracy of
   the molecular mechanics force fields and the efficiency of the sampling
   algorithms. This review discusses a number of aspects concerning
   molecular simulation studies of RPLC systems including the historical
   development of the subject, the background needed to understand the two
   prevalent techniques, molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC)
   methods, and the wealth of insight provided by these sirriulations.
   Examples from the literature employing MD approaches and from the
   authors' laboratory using MC methods are discussed. The former can
   provide information on chain dynamics and transport properties, whereas
   the latter techniques are uniquely suited for the investigation of phase
   and sorption equilibria that underly RPLC retention, and both can be
   used to elucidate the bonded-chain conformations and solvent
   distributions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Descending projections from the cortex to subcortical structures are
   critical for auditory plasticity, including the ability for central

   cortex in guinea pigs produces excitatory responses in the central
   nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CNIC) with two tonotopic patterns: a
   narrow tuned pattern that is consistent with previous findings showing
   direct frequency-aligned projections; and a broad tuned pattern in which
   the auditory cortex can influence multiple frequency regions. Moreover,
   excitatory responses could be elicited in the caudomedial portion along
   the isofrequency laminae of the CNIC but not in the rostrolateral
   portion. This descending organization may underlie or contribute to the
   ability of the auditory cortex to induce changes in frequency tuning of
   subcortical neurons as shown extensively in previous studies.}},

Abstract = {{closed cell rigid foams for thermal insulation. One problem is loss of
   blowing gases, which leads to slow increase in thermal conductivity. PU
   composites with plate-like nanofillers create a diffusion barrier,
   reducing gas transport and slowing insulation aging. In this research, a
   new in situ intercalative polymerization is described to disperse
   vermiculite (VMT) in PU. When VMT was modified by cation exchange with
   long-chain quaternary ammonium, the dispersion in methylene diphenyl
   diisocyanate (MDI) was significantly improved. Dispersion of VMT
   dispersibility was characterized using rheology, microscopy, and X-ray
   scattering/diffraction. With the method of polyol-assisted VMT
   dispersion, electron microscopy revealed extensive intercalation and
   exfoliation of clay particles. In contrast, simple mixing of organoclay
   in MDI resulted in macroscopic localization and poor distribution of
   clay particles in PU. The final nanocomposites prepared by the
   master-batch method showed enhancement of mechanical properties (85\%
   increase in elastic modulus) and reduction in permeability to CO
   upsilon, as much as 40\%, at a low clay concentration of 3.3 wt \%.}},

Abstract = {{Conjugation is one of the most common ways bacteria acquire antibiotic
   resistance, contributing to the emergence of multidrug-resistant
   ``superbugs.{''} Bacteria of the genus Enterococcus faecalis are highly
   antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens that use the mechanism of
   conjugation to spread antibiotic resistance between resistance-bearing
   donor cells and resistance-deficient recipient cells. Here, we report a
   unique quorum sensing-based communication system that uses two
   antagonistic signaling molecules to regulate conjugative transfer of
   tetracycline-resistance plasmid pCF10 in E. faecalis. A
   ``mate-sensing{''} peptide sex pheromone produced by recipient cells is
   detected by donor cells to induce conjugative genetic transfer. Using
   mathematical modeling and experimentation, we show that a second
   antagonistic ``self-sensing{''} signaling peptide, previously known to
   suppress self-induction of donor cells, also serves as a classic
   quorum-sensing signal for donors that functions to reduce
   antibiotic-resistance transfer at high donor density. This unique form
   of quorum sensing may provide a means of limiting the spread of the
   plasmid and present opportunities to control antibiotic-resistance
   transfer through manipulation of intercellular signaling, with
   implications in the clinical setting.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic impurities are critical for many technologies. They are used to
   engineer the optical and electronic properties of semiconductors for
   applications such as transistors, solar cells, light emitting diodes
   (LEDs), and lasers, as well as to store energy for applications such as
   batteries and electrochemical cells. While the characterization and
   understanding of impurities in bulk semiconductors is well developed,
   new challenges arise at the nanoscale. In particular, methods are needed
   to characterize structures that may only contain a few impurity atoms.
   With such techniques, a fundamental understanding of how atomic
   impurities affect the properties of semiconductor nanostructures could
   be more fully developed. In this review, we give a brief introduction to
   the benefits and challenges associated with the incorporation of
   impurities in nanoscale structures, a process known as doping. We then
   focus on techniques used to characterize and image atomic impurities in
   semiconductor nanostructures. Advances in electron microscopy allow
   researchers to probe the dynamics of impurity incorporation with in situ
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and techniques such as electron
   energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) coupled with annular dark-field scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (ADF-STEM) allow individual atomic
   impurities in semiconductor nanostructures to be detected and imaged.
   Likewise, techniques such as atom probe tomography (APT) enable the full
   atomic reconstruction of nanoscale materials.}},

   technologies produced similar transcriptome profiles as evident from
   high Pearson's correlation statistics ranging from 0.70 to 0.83, and
   from nearly identical clustering of the tissues. RNA-Seq provided
   enhanced coverage of the transcriptome, with 82.1\% of the filtered
   maize genes detected as expressed in at least one tissue by RNA-Seq
   compared to only 56.5\% detected by microarrays. Further, from the set
   of 465 maize genes that have been historically well characterized by
   mutant analysis, 427 show significant expression in at least one tissue
   by RNA-Seq compared to 390 by microarray analysis. RNA-Seq provided
   higher resolution for identifying tissue-specific expression as well as
   for distinguishing the expression profiles of closely related paralogs
   as compared to microarray-derived profiles. Co-expression analysis
   derived from the microarray and RNA-Seq data revealed that broadly
   similar networks result from both platforms, and that co-expression
   estimates are stable even when constructed from mixed data including
   both RNA-Seq and microarray expression data. The RNA-Seq information
   provides a useful complement to the microarray-based maize gene atlas
   and helps to further understand the dynamics of transcription during
   maize development.}},

Title = {{Revisiting Blob Theory for DNA Diffusivity in Slitlike Confinement}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{110}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{Blob theory has been widely applied to describe polymer conformations
   and dynamics in nanoconfinement. In slit confinement, blob theory
   predicts a scaling exponent of 2/3 for polymer diffusivity as a function
   of slit height, yet a large body of experimental studies using DNA
   produce a scaling exponent significantly less than 2/3. In this work, we
   develop a theory that predicts that this discrepancy occurs because the
   segment correlation function for a semiflexible chain such as DNA does
   not follow the Flory exponent for length scales smaller than the
   persistence length. We show that these short length scale effects
   contribute significantly to the scaling for the DNA diffusivity, but do
   not appreciably affect the scalings for static properties. Our theory is
   fully supported by Monte Carlo simulations, quantitative agreement with
   DNA experiments, and the results reconcile this outstanding problem for
   confined polymers. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.168105}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{93}},
Pages = {{163-172}},
Month = {{APR 19}},
Abstract = {{The heterogeneous oxidation of Zn(g) is a promising reaction pathway for
   the conversion of CO2 into CO in the two-step Zn/ZnO solar
   thermochemical cycle as it eliminates the solid-state diffusion
   limitation that plagues the oxidation of Zn(l,s). The rate of the
   heterogeneous oxidation of Zn(g) is measured gravimetrically in a quartz
   tubular flow reactor operated at atmospheric pressure for temperatures
   between 800 and 1150 K, Zn(g) concentrations up to 36 mol\%, and CO2
   concentrations up to 45 mol\%. The surface kinetics are extracted from
   the global reaction rate using a numerical reacting flow model that
   accounts for the transport of reacting species in the gas phase. The
   oxidation of Zn(g) by CO2 is rapid, on the order of 10(-8)-10(-5) mol
   cm(-2) S-1, and the rate is proportional to the product of the Zn(g) and
   CO2 partial pressures at the reaction surface. The activation energy for
   the Arrhenius reaction rate parameter is 44 +/- 3 kJ mol(-1) and the
   pre-exponential factor is (92 +/- 6) x 10(-3) mol cm(-2) S-1 atm(-2). As
   a result of the rapid rate of oxidation of Zn(g), less than 1 s is
   required to convert more than 85\% of Zn to ZnO. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Human-associated microbial communities vary across individuals: possible
   contributing factors include (genetic) relatedness, diet, and age.
   However, our surroundings, including individuals with whom we interact,
   also likely shape our microbial communities. To quantify this microbial
   exchange, we surveyed fecal, oral, and skin microbiota from 60 families
   (spousal units with children, dogs, both, or neither). Household
   members, particularly couples, shared more of their microbiota than
   individuals from different households, with stronger effects of
   co-habitation on skin than oral or fecal microbiota. Dog ownership
   significantly increased the shared skin microbiota in cohabiting adults,
   and dog-owning adults shared more `skin' microbiota with their own dogs
   than with other dogs. Although the degree to which these shared microbes
   have a true niche on the human body, vs transient detection after direct
   contact, is unknown, these results suggest that direct and frequent
   contact with our cohabitants may significantly shape the composition of
   our microbial communities.}},

   structure of turbulent flow over a gravel bed}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{Modeling turbulent flows at high Reynolds number requires solving
   simplified variants of the Navier-Stokes equations. The methods used to
   close the resulting Reynolds-averaged, or eddy simulation equations
   usually follow classical theory and, at small enough scales, postulate
   universal scaling for turbulence that is independent of the velocity
   itself. This may not be the best way to conceptualize geophysical
   turbulence. Turbulent intermittency may be defined in terms of the local
   ``roughness{''} of the velocity signal as measured by pointwise Holder
   exponents. This study investigates the joint velocity-intermittency
   structure of flow over a gravel-bed surface with migrating bed forms. We
   report clear velocity-intermittency dependence and quantify its nature
   above the moving bed form profile. Our results imply differences in
   energy transfer close to bed forms at shorter wavelengths than those
   forced directly. Hence, progress in modeling flows of geophysical
   relevance may require a reconsideration of the principles on which
   turbulence closures are based.}},

Abstract = {{We have constructed and applied an algorithm to simulate the behavior of
   zeolite frameworks during liquid adsorption. We applied this approach to
   compute the adsorption isotherms of furfural-water and hydroxymethyl
   furfural (HMF)-water mixtures adsorbing in silicalite zeolite at 300 K
   for comparison with experimental data. We modeled these adsorption
   processes under two different statistical mechanical ensembles: the
   grand canonical (V-N-z-mu(g)-T or GC) ensemble keeping volume fixed, and
   the P-N-z-mu(g)- T (osmotic) ensemble allowing volume to fluctuate. To
   optimize accuracy and efficiency, we compared pure Monte Carlo (MC)
   sampling to hybrid MC-molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. For the
   external furfural-water and HMF-water phases, we assumed the ideal
   solution approximation and employed a combination of tabulated data and
   extended ensemble simulations for computing solvation free energies. We
   found that MC sampling in the V-N-z-mu(g)-T ensemble (i.e., standard
   GCMC) does a poor job of reproducing both the Henry's law regime and the
   saturation loadings of these systems. Hybrid MC-MD sampling of the
   V-N-z-mu(g)-T ensemble, which includes framework vibrations at fixed
   total volume, provides better results in the Henry's law region, but
   this approach still does not reproduce experimental saturation loadings.
   Pure MC sampling of the osmotic ensemble was found to approach
   experimental saturation loadings more closely, whereas hybrid MC-MD
   sampling of the osmotic ensemble quantitatively reproduces such loadings
   because the MC-MD approach naturally allows for locally anisotropic
   volume changes wherein some pores expand whereas others contract.}},

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated enhanced spectral conversion of a fiber Bragg
   grating (FBG) incorporating a polarization-diversity loop configuration
   (PDLC) with increased degree of freedom (DOF) in polarization control
   through the addition of wave plates. The proposed apparatus for spectral
   conversion consists of a four-port polarization beam splitter for
   constructing the PDLC, an FBG, and three wave plates including one
   half-wave and two quarter-wave plates. In the previous study using only
   two wave plates, slight birefringence of single-mode fibers connecting
   optical elements within the polarization-diversity loop induced random
   changes of states of polarization (SOPs), resulting in the spectral
   degradation. In this approach, the increased number of wave plates could
   complement it by providing a higher DOF in controlling SOPs and
   significantly improve spectral performances of the fabricated filter
   such as an insertion loss, side-mode suppression ratio, and
   band-rejection ratio. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{APOBEC3F (A3F) and APOBEC3G (A3G) are DNA cytosine deaminases that
   potently restrict human immunodeficiency virus type 1 replication when
   the virus is deprived of its accessory protein Vif (virion infectivity
   factor). Vif counteracts these restriction factors by recruiting A3F and
   A3G to an E3 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase complex that mediates their
   polyubiquitination (polyUb) and proteasomal degradation. While previous
   efforts have identified single amino acid residues in APOBEC3 proteins
   required for Vif recognition, less is known about the downstream Ub
   acceptor sites that are targeted. One prior report identified a cluster
   of polyubiquitinated residues in A3G and proposed an antiparallel model
   of A3G interaction with the Vif E3 Ub ligase complex wherein Vif binding
   at one terminus of A3G orients the opposite terminus for polyUb
   {[}Iwatani et al. (2009). Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 106, 19539-19544].
   To test the generalizability of this model, we carried out a complete
   mutagenesis of the lysine residues in A3F and used a complementary,
   unbiased proteomic approach to identify Ub acceptor sites targeted by
   Vif. Our data indicate that internal lysines are the dominant Ub
   acceptor sites in both A3F and A3G. In contrast with the proposed
   antiparallel model, however, we find that the Vif-dependent polyUb of
   A3F and A3G can occur at multiple acceptor sites dispersed along
   predicted lysine-enriched surfaces of both the N- and C-terminal
   deaminase domains. These data suggest an alternative model for binding
   of APOBEC3 proteins to the Vif E3 Ub ligase complex and diminish
   enthusiasm for the amenability of APOBEC3 Ub acceptor sites to
   therapeutic intervention. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Periodic ripples of amplitude similar to 15 nm were formed in suspended
   bilayer graphene after nanoindentation with incremental forces up to 600
   nN. The structure was annealed at similar to 620K in high vacuum and the
   corresponding modifications in the mechanical properties and surface
   morphology were investigated. The pre-tension of the pristine sample was
   found to be 1.46Nm(-1) and after annealing it was reduced to 0.72Nm(-1).
   The nanometre-sized ripples induced by mechanical excitation were found
   to be flattened after annealing. Tailoring surface corrugations in
   bilayer graphene through nanoindentation and thermal engineering of
   these ripples thus provides an innovative fabrication route for flexible
   electronic devices and strain sensors.}},

Abstract = {{The magnetostatic interaction between magnetic domain walls (DWs) in

   DWs. We show that the magnetostatic interaction between DWs causes not
   only mutual pinning, as observed till now, but that a travelling DW can
   also induce the depinning of DWs in near-by tracks. These effects may
   have great implications for some proposed high density magnetic devices

Abstract = {{Large scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to study
   the oxidation of highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) by
   hyperthermal atomic oxygen beam (5 eV). Simulations are performed using
   the ReaxFF classical reactive force field. We present here additional
   evidence that this method accurately reproduces ab initio derived
   energies relevant to HOPG oxidation. HOPG is modeled as multilayer
   graphene and etch-pit formation and evolution is directly simulated
   through a large number of sequential atomic oxygen collisions. The
   simulations predict that an oxygen coverage is first established that
   acts as a precursor to carbon removal reactions, which ultimately etch
   wide but shallow pits, as observed in experiments. In quantitative
   agreement with experiment, the simulations predict the most abundant
   product species to be O-2 (via recombination reactions), followed by
   CO2, with CO as the least abundant product species. Although
   recombination occurs all over the graphene sheet, the carbon removal
   reactions occur only about the edges of the etch pit. Through isolated
   defect analysis on small graphene models as well as trajectory analysis
   performed directly on the predicted etch pit, the activation energies
   for the dominant reaction mechanisms leading to O-2, CO2, and CO product
   species are determined to be 0.3, 0.52, and 0.67 eV, respectively.
   Overall, the qualitative and quantitative agreement between MD
   simulation and experiment is very promising. Thus, the MD simulation
   approach and C/H/O ReaxFF parametrization may be useful for simulating
   high-temperature gas interactions with graphitic materials where the
   microstructure is more complex than HOPG.}},

Abstract = {{Here we summarize recent progress in the development of
   electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) for organic and printed

   the use of electrolytes in electronics is an old concept going back to
   the early days of the silicon transistor, new printable, fast-response
   polymer electrolytes are expanding the potential applications of EGTs in
   flexible, printed digital circuits, rollable displays, and conformal
   bioelectronic sensors. This report introduces the structure and
   operation mechanisms of EGTs and reviews key developments in electrolyte
   materials for use in printed electronics. The bulk of the article is

Abstract = {{We consider fractional Stefan melting problems which involve a memory of
   the latent-heat accumulation. We show that the manner in which the
   memory of the latent-heat accumulation is recorded depends on the
   assumed nature of the transition between the liquid and the solid
   phases. When a sharp interface between the liquid and the solid phases
   is assumed, the memory of the accumulation of the latent heat is
   ``lumped{''} in the history of the speed of the interface. In contrast,
   when a diffuse interface is assumed, the memory of the accumulation is
   ``distributed{''} throughout the liquid phase. By use of an example
   problem, we demonstrate that the equivalence of the sharp-and
   diffuse-interface models can only occur when there is no memory in the
   system. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevE.87.042401}},

Abstract = {{The energy intensive harvesting of tiny microalgae cells (1-70 mu m)
   from culture broth accounts for at least 20-30\% of total costs of algal
   biomass production. The aim of this study was to develop an alternative
   fungus pelletization assisted bioflocculation method for harvesting
   microalgae using pellet-forming fungal strain (Aspergillus oryzae)
   isolated from municipal wastewater sludge. Facultative heterotrophic
   microalga Chlorella vulgaris UMN235 was used as a model species. Under
   heterotrophic growth condition, the key factors including spore
   inoculums, organic carbon concentration in medium as well as pH
   variation had significantly positive effects on fungus-algae pellet
   formation. The process parameters of 1.2 x 10(4) spores/mL, 20 g/L
   glucose, and pH ranged from 4.0 to 5.0 were found optimal for efficient
   fungus-algae pellet formation. For autotrophic growth, when pH of
   culture broth was adjusted to 4.0-5.0 with organic carbon addition (10
   g/L glucose), almost 100\% harvesting efficiency of microalgae was
   obtained. Moreover, it was observed that diameter and the concentration
   of fungus-algae pellets were affected by the shaker rotation. The novel
   harvesting technology developed in this study might reduce the
   microalgae harvesting cost and will have potential to be applied to all

Abstract = {{The neural mechanisms of language abnormalities, the core symptoms in
   schizophrenia, remain unclear. In this study, a new experimental
   paradigm, combining magnetoencephalography (MEG) techniques and machine
   intelligence methodologies, was designed to gain knowledge about the
   frequency, brain location, and time of occurrence of the neural
   oscillations that are associated with lexical processing in
   schizophrenia. The 248-channel MEG recordings were obtained from 12
   patients with schizophrenia and 10 healthy controls, during a lexical
   processing task, where the patients discriminated correct from incorrect
   lexical stimuli that were visually presented. Event-related
   desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/ERS) was computed along the
   frequency, time, and space dimensions combined, that resulted in a large
   spectral-spatial-temporal ERD/ERS feature set. Machine intelligence
   techniques were then applied to select a small subset of oscillation
   patterns that are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia, according to
   their discriminating power in patient and control classification.
   Patients with schizophrenia showed abnormal ERD/ERS patterns during both
   lexical encoding and post-encoding periods. The top-ranked features were
   located at the occipital and left frontal-temporal areas, and covered a
   wide frequency range, including delta (1-4 Hz), alpha (8-12 Hz), beta
   (12-32 Hz), and gamma (32-48 Hz) bands. These top features could
   discriminate the patient group from the control group with 90.91\% high
   accuracy, which demonstrates significant brain oscillation abnormalities
   in patients with schizophrenia at the specific frequency, time, and
   brain location indicated by these top features. As neural oscillation
   abnormality may be due to the mechanisms of the disease, the spectral,
   spatial, and temporal content of the discriminating features can offer
   useful information for helping understand the physiological basis of the
   language disorder in schizophrenia, as well as the pathology of the
   disease itself.}},

Abstract = {{Although laboratory generated virus aerosols have been widely studied in
   terms of infectivity and survivability, how they are related to particle
   size, especially in the submicron size range, is little understood. Four
   viruses (MS2 bacteriophage, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, swine
   influenza virus, and avian influenza virus) were aerosolized, size
   classified (100-450nm) using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA), and
   collected onto gelatin filters. Uranine dye was also nebulized with the
   virus, serving as a particle tracer. Virus infectivity assay and
   quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were then
   used to quantify the amount of infectious virus and total virus present
   in the samples, respectively. The virus distribution was found to be
   better represented by the particle volume distribution rather than the
   particle number distribution. The capacity for a particle to carry virus
   increased with the particle size and the relationship could be described
   by a power law. Virus survivability was dependent on virus type and
   particle size. Survivability of the three animal viruses at large
   particle size (300-450nm) was significantly higher than at particle size
   close to the size of the virion (100-200nm), which could be due to the
   shielding effect. The data suggest that particle size plays an important
   role in infectivity and survivability of airborne viruses and may,
   therefore, have an impact on the airborne transmission of viral illness
   and disease. The data in this study do not support the use of MS2
   bacteriophage as a general surrogate for animal and human viruses.

Abstract = {{A method was developed to evaluate miniature diesel particulate filters
   (DPFs). To validate the performance of the instrumentation and test
   apparatus, measurements were made using silicon carbide (SiC) and
   cordierite miniature filters with representative microstructures.
   Filtration efficiency (FE), the most penetrating particle size (MPPS),
   and pressure drop were measured for catalyzed and uncatalyzed advanced
   ceramic material (ACM) acicular mullite and representative commercial
   filters to determine the impact of substrate morphology, the formation
   of a soot cake, and the presence of a catalyst coating on filtration
   properties. FE measurements demonstrated that filter geometry and
   microstructure significantly influence initial filtration performance.
   ACM filters had high initial FE and the MPPS near approximate to 200nm.
   Reduction of the ACM pore size in the absence of a reduction in porosity
   increased initial FE even more, but its influence on MPPS was not
   resolvable. The presence of a catalyst and washcoat on the ACM increased
   the pressure drop but increased initial FE and reduced MPPS to <100nm.
   The addition of a washcoat allowed the rapid buildup of a soot cake,
   which resulted in a more rapid rate of increase in FE compared to
   uncatalyzed ACM. The similarity in the ACM and cordierite soot cakes
   after a long loading time is consistent with theory that suggests the
   formation of the soot cake depends primarily on the Peclet (Pe) number,
   which is influenced only by macroscopic filter geometry and prevailing
   test conditions. Copyright 2013 American Association for Aerosol

Title = {{Contribution of Different Anatomical and Physiologic Factors to Iris
   Contour and Anterior Chamber Angle Changes During Pupil Dilation:
   Theoretical Analysis}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{54}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate the contribution of three anatomical and
   physiologic factors (dilator thickness, dynamic pupillary block, and
   iris compressibility) to changes in iris configuration and anterior
   chamber angle during pupil dilation.
   METHODS. A mathematical model of the anterior segment based on the
   average values of ocular dimensions was developed to simulate pupil
   dilation. To change the pupil diameter from 3.0 to 5.4 mm in 10 seconds,
   active dilator contraction was applied by imposing stress in the dilator
   region. Three sets of parameters were varied in the simulations: (1) a
   thin (4 mu m, 1\% of full thickness) versus a thick dilator (covering
   the full thickness iris) to quantify the effects of dilator anatomy, (2)
   in the presence (+PB) versus absence of pupillary block (-PB) to
   quantify the effect of dynamic motion of aqueous humor from the
   posterior to the anterior chamber, and (3) a compressible versus an
   incompressible iris to quantify the effects of iris volume change.
   Changes in the apparent iris-lens contact and angle open distance
   (AOD500) were calculated for each case.
   RESULTS. The thin case predicted a significant increase (average 700\%)
   in iris curvature compared with the thick case (average 70\%), showing
   that the anatomy of dilator plays an important role in iris deformation
   during dilation. In the presence of pupillary block (+PB), AOD500
   decreased 25\% and 36\% for the compressible and incompressible iris,
   respectively.
   CONCLUSIONS. Iris bowing during dilation was driven primarily by
   posterior location of the dilator muscle and by dynamic pupillary block,
   but the effect of pupillary block was not as large as that of the
   dilator anatomy according to the quantified values of AOD500.
   Incompressibility of the iris, in contrast, had a relatively small
   effect on iris curvature but a large effect on AOD500; thus, we conclude
   that all three effects are important.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an overset-curvilinear immersed boundary (overset-CURVIB)
   method in a general non-inertial frame of reference to simulate a wide
   range of challenging biological flow problems. The method incorporates
   overset-curvilinear grids to efficiently handle multi-connected
   geometries and increase the resolution locally near immersed boundaries.
   Complex bodies undergoing arbitrarily large deformations may be embedded
   within the overset-curvilinear background grid and treated as sharp
   interfaces using the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method (Ge
   and Sotiropoulos, J Comput Phys, 2007). The incompressible flow
   equations are formulated in a general non-inertial frame of reference to
   enhance the overall versatility and efficiency of the numerical
   approach. Efficient search algorithms to identify areas requiring
   blanking, donor cells, and interpolation coefficients for constructing
   the boundary conditions at grid interfaces of the overset grid are
   developed and implemented using efficient parallel computing
   communication strategies to transfer information among sub-domains. The
   governing equations are discretized using a second-order accurate
   finite-volume approach and integrated in time via an efficient
   fractional-step method. Various strategies for ensuring globally
   conservative interpolation at grid interfaces suitable for
   incompressible flow fractional step methods are implemented and
   evaluated. The method is verified and validated against experimental
   data, and its capabilities are demonstrated by simulating the flow past
   multiple aquatic swimmers and the systolic flow in an anatomic left
   ventricle with a mechanical heart valve implanted in the aortic
   position. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Impulsive noise is an important challenge for the practical

   suppressing the adverse effect of sudden large amplitude impulses than
   FXLMS algorithm, and in particular, the proposed modified FXLMM
   algorithm can achieve better stability without sacrificing the
   performance of residual noise when encountering impulses. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper presents a simple formulation to predict the size effect
   curve of mean structural strength of the asphalt mixture from the
   strength histogram obtained on single-size beam specimens under
   three-point bend tests. This method is based on the weakest link model
   (WLM), which relates the mean structural strength to the size dependence
   of the probability distribution of the material strength. The proposed
   formulation is verified by an extensive experimental work consisting of
   strength histogram and mean size effect tests on the asphalt mixture at
   low temperature. The mean strength size effect curve obtained from the
   WLM is found to be in very good agreement with the experimental mean
   strength results obtained on the asphalt mixture specimens of different
   sizes and geometries, providing evidence of the ductile to brittle
   transition (Type I size effect) of the asphalt mixture strength.}},

Journal = {{NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},

Number = {{8}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Studying complex biological processes such as cancer development, stem
   cell induction and transdifferentiation requires the modulation of
   multiple genes or pathways at one time in a single cell. Herein, we
   describe straightforward methods for rapid and efficient assembly of
   bacterial marker free multigene cassettes containing up to six
   complementary DNAs/short hairpin RNAs. We have termed this method RecWay
   assembly, as it makes use of both Cre recombinase and the commercially
   available Gateway cloning system. Further, because RecWay assembly uses
   truly modular components, it allows for the generation of randomly
   assembled multigene vector libraries. These multigene vectors are
   integratable, and later excisable, using the highly efficient piggyBac
   (PB) DNA transposon system. Moreover, we have dramatically improved the
   expression of stably integrated multigene vectors by incorporation of
   insulator elements to prevent promoter interference seen with multigene
   vectors. We demonstrate that insulated multigene PB transposons can
   stably integrate and faithfully express up to five fluorescent proteins
   and the puromycin-thymidine kinase resistance gene in vitro, with up to
   70-fold higher gene expression compared with analogous uninsulated
   vectors. RecWay assembly of multigene transposon vectors allows for
   widely applicable modelling of highly complex biological processes and
   can be easily performed by other research laboratories.}},

Title = {{Distinct Types of Disorder in the Human Proteome: Functional
   Implications for Alternative Splicing}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Intrinsically disordered regions have been associated with various
   cellular processes and are implicated in several human diseases, but
   their exact roles remain unclear. We previously defined two classes of
   conserved disordered regions in budding yeast, referred to as
   ``flexible'' and ``constrained'' conserved disorder. In flexible
   disorder, the property of disorder has been positionally conserved
   during evolution, whereas in constrained disorder, both the amino acid
   sequence and the property of disorder have been conserved. Here, we show
   that flexible and constrained disorder are widespread in the human
   proteome, and are particularly common in proteins with regulatory
   functions. Both classes of disordered sequences are highly enriched in
   regions of proteins that undergo tissue-specific (TS) alternative
   splicing (AS), but not in regions of proteins that undergo general
   (i.e., not tissue-regulated) AS. Flexible disorder is more highly
   enriched in TS alternative exons, whereas constrained disorder is more
   highly enriched in exons that flank TS alternative exons. These latter
   regions are also significantly more enriched in potential phosphosites
   and other short linear motifs associated with cell signaling. We further
   show that cancer driver mutations are significantly enriched in regions
   of proteins associated with TS and general AS. Collectively, our results
   point to distinct roles for TS alternative exons and flanking exons in
   the dynamic regulation of protein interaction networks in response to
   signaling activity, and they further suggest that alternatively spliced
   regions of proteins are often functionally altered by mutations
   responsible for cancer.}},

Title = {{BUCKLING OF A PLATE ON A PASTERNAK FOUNDATION UNDER UNIFORM IN-PLANE
   BENDING LOADS}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL STABILITY AND DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In-plane bending loads occur in many thin-walled structures, including
   web core sandwich panels (foam-filled panels with interior webs) under
   transverse loading. The design of such structures is limited in part by
   local buckling of the thin webs and the subsequent impact on stiffness
   and strength. However, the core material can have a significant impact
   on web buckling strength and thus must be considered in design. This
   paper presents solutions for the buckling strength of simply supported
   plates under in-plane bending loads. The location of the neutral bending
   axis is allowed to vary and is characterized by a load parameter. A
   Pasternak model is used to account for the resistance of the foundation
   to compression and shear. Using the principle of minimum potential
   energy, buckling solutions are developed for infinitely long plates and
   representative foundation materials. The solutions match known results
   for two special cases: Uniform loading with variable foundation, and
   bending loads with no foundation. An order of magnitude increase in
   buckling strength is possible, depending on loading and foundation
   stiffness. The results suggest an important avenue for future
   development of lightweight structures, including sandwich panels and
   structures such as plate girders that are not typically associated with
   the use of foam filling.}},

Abstract = {{Phase equilibria of alpha, beta, and gamma (Mg,Fe)(2)SiO4 are important
   to understanding the mineralogy of the Earth's upper mantle. Using the
   first principles approach, we studied thermodynamic properties and phase
   stability fields of Fe2SiO4. We show that the correct phase transition
   sequence in Fe2SiO4 (alpha -> gamma) can be obtained with the DFT +
   self-consistent Hubbard U method, while standard DFT methods (LSDA and
   sigma-GGA) as well as the DFT + constant U method fail the task. The
   vibrational virtual crystal approximation was used to derive the phonon
   density of state of the Fe2SiO4 polymorphs. High-pressure thermodynamic
   properties of Fe2SiO4 are then derived with the aid of the
   quasi-harmonic approximation. They are in very good agreement with
   experiments. The phase diagram of the (Mg,Fe)(2)SiO4 system is
   calculated under the assumption of ideal mixing within alpha, beta, and
   gamma solid solutions. The model permits the investigation of the
   temperature and pressure effects on the phase boundaries. The widths of
   the divariant alpha-beta and beta-gamma loops are barely sensitive to
   temperature between 1473 and 1873 K. This study shows the promise of
   applying the DFT + self-consistent Hubbard U method to study phase
   equilibria of iron-bearing Earth minerals. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{In numerical simulations of mantle convection it is commonly assumed
   that the coefficients of thermal expansion alpha and thermal conduction
   k are either constant or pressure-dependent. Pressure changes are
   generally computed using parametrizations that rely on extrapolations of
   low-pressure data for a single upper-mantle phase. Here we collect data
   for both the pressure and temperature dependence of alpha from a
   database of first-principles calculations, and of k from recent
   experimental studies. We use these data-sets to construct analytical
   parametrizations of alpha and k for the major upper- and lower-mantle
   phases that can be easily incorporated into exisiting convection codes.
   We then analyze the impact of such parametrizations on Earth's mantle
   dynamics by employing two-dimensional numerical models of thermal
   convection. When alpha is the only variable parameter, both its
   temperature and pressure dependence enhance hot plumes and tend to
   inhibit the descent of cold downwellings. Taking into account a variable
   k leads to a strong increase of the bulk mantle temperature, which
   reduces the buoyancy available to amplify bottom boundary layer
   instabilities and causes mantle flow to be driven primarily by the
   instability of cold plates whose surface velocity also tends to rise.
   When both parameters are considered together, we observe an increased
   propensity to local layering which favors slab stagnation in the
   transition zone and subsequent thickening in the lower mantle.
   Furthermore, the values of k near the core-mantle boundary ultimately
   control the effect of this physical property on convection, which
   stresses the importance of determining the thermal conductivity of the
   post-perovskite phase. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Identification of Rtl1, a Retrotransposon-Derived Imprinted Gene, as a

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},

Abstract = {{We previously utilized a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis
   screen to discover novel drivers of HCC. This approach identified
   recurrent mutations within the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted domain, indicating
   that alteration of one or more elements within the domain provides a
   selective advantage to cells during the process of hepatocarcinogenesis.
   For the current study, we performed transcriptome and small RNA
   sequencing to profile gene expression in SB-induced HCCs in an attempt
   to clarify the genetic element(s) contributing to tumorigenesis. We
   identified strong induction of Retrotransposon-like 1 (Rtl1) expression
   as the only consistent alteration detected in all SB-induced tumors with
   Dlk1-Dio3 integrations, suggesting that Rtl1 activation serves as a
   driver of HCC. While previous studies have identified correlations
   between disrupted expression of multiple Dlk1-Dio3 domain members and
   HCC, we show here that direct modulation of a single domain member,
   Rtl1, can promote hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo. Overexpression of Rtl1
   in the livers of adult mice using a hydrodynamic gene delivery technique
   resulted in highly penetrant (86\%) tumor formation. Additionally, we
   detected overexpression of RTL1 in 30\% of analyzed human HCC samples,
   indicating the potential relevance of this locus as a therapeutic target
   for patients. The Rtl1 locus is evolutionarily derived from the
   domestication of a retrotransposon. In addition to identifying Rtl1 as a
   novel driver of HCC, our study represents one of the first direct in
   vivo demonstrations of a role for such a co-opted genetic element in
   promoting carcinogenesis.}},

Abstract = {{Nontoxic bioresorbable polymersomes have been developed that efficiently
   and site-selectively tether targeting peptides under mild conditions
   with no toxic catalysts. The binding and release properties of these
   polymersomes have been evaluated when targeting DLD-1 human colon cancer
   cells overexpressing the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. The delivery efficacy
   to these cells is markedly improved over commonly used RGD targeting
   peptides by use of an alpha(5)beta(1)-specific targeting peptide, PR\_b.
   Release profiles in buffered solution from pH 7.4 to 4.5 were evaluated
   and compared to release after binding to cells, and enzymatic
   degradation was identified as a major cause of rapid payload release in
   the cell. Intracellular trafficking and release were imaged via confocal
   microscopy in live cells and colocalization with organelles was
   evaluated quantitatively over time. Finally, the anticancer drug
   cisplatin was encapsulated in the PR\_b functionalized polymersomes and
   the presence of PR\_b greatly improved delivery efficacy, with increased
   cisplatin-induced losses to targeted DLD-1 colon cancer cell viability.
   When delivered to CACO-2 model human epithelial cells expressing low
   levels of alpha(5)beta(1) integrin, low toxicity was maintained,
   suggesting that targeting was specific to alpha(5)beta(1) overexpressing
   cells. These results demonstrate that PR\_b-functionalized bioresorbable
   polymersomes may be an attractive route to minimizing the dose-limiting
   side effects associated with existing approaches to cisplatin
   chemotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of imperfections on the response of simply-supported
   post-tensioned masonry (PTM) walls subject to out-of-plane loading is
   investigated. Two types of imperfections of the masonry and/or tendons
   are studied: a linear misalignment and an initial deflection defined
   using a sinusoid. Walls with a range of slenderness ratios are
   considered, in addition to walls with restrained and unrestrained
   tendons. By means of finite element studies, imperfections were found to
   affect the nominal flexural strength of the walls by as much as 10\% for
   a linear imperfection and 20\% for an initial deflection. However, the
   tolerance limits on the placement of masonry and post-tensioning
   tendons, coupled with the conservatism implicit in the nominal flexural
   strength formulas developed for design use in the US, appear to be
   sufficient to offset those differences, thus precluding consideration of
   accidental eccentricity for PTM walls. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study the structure of a normal shock wave in noble gas mixtures
   (Xe-He and Ar-He) of various compositions using molecular dynamics and
   direct simulation Monte Carlo. The molecular dynamics simulations are
   first validated against experimental data. Good agreement is found
   between the molecular dynamics solutions and the experimental
   measurements, with the exception of the parallel temperature profile in
   the 24.7\% Ar-He mixture, despite the satisfactory agreement between the
   parallel velocity profiles. Secondly, a validation against direct
   simulation Monte Carlo solutions obtained with the accurate generalized
   hard sphere model is presented. As expected, the generalized hard sphere
   direct simulation Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics solutions are in
   near-perfect agreement. Finally, molecular dynamics results are compared
   to those obtained with the lower fidelity variable hard sphere model,
   which, if inappropriately parametrized, fails to describe the shock wave

Abstract = {{Steady state, isotopic, and chemical transient studies of ethanol
   dehydration on gamma-alumina show unimolecular and bimolecular
   dehydration reactions of ethanol are reversibly inhibited by the
   formation of ethanol-water dimers at 488 K. Measured rates of ethylene
   synthesis are independent of ethanol pressure (1.9-7.0 kPa) but decrease
   with increasing water pressure (0.4-2.2 kPa), reflecting the competitive
   adsorption of ethanol-water dimers with ethanol monomers; while diethyl
   ether formation rates have a positive, less than first order dependence
   on ethanol pressure (0.9-4.7 kPa) and also decrease with water pressure
   (0.6-2.2 kPa), signifying a competition for active sites between
   ethanol-water dimers and ethanol dimers. Pyridine inhibits the rate of
   ethylene and diethyl ether formation to different extents verifying the
   existence of acidic and nonequivalent active sites for the dehydration
   reactions. A primary kinetic isotope effect does not occur for diethyl
   ether synthesis from deuterated ethanol and only occurs for ethylene
   synthesis when the beta-proton is deuterated; demonstrating olefin
   synthesis is kinetically limited by either the cleavage of a C-beta-H
   bond or the desorption of water on the gamma-alumina surface and ether
   synthesis is limited by the cleavage of either the C-O bond of the
   alcohol molecule or the Al-O bond of a surface bound ethoxide species.
   These observations are consistent with a mechanism inhibited by the
   formation of dimer species. The proposed model rigorously describes the
   observed kinetics at this temperature and highlights the fundamental
   differences between the Lewis acidic gamma-alumina and Bronsted acidic
   zeolite catalysts.}},

   system under base-level change}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{53}},
Pages = {{39-47}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We present a geometric model to study the role of base-level change in
   the dynamics of the alluvial-bedrock transition and shoreline positions
   in a fluvially dominated deltaic system. The domain of the problem is a
   sediment wedge in the long-profile cross-section. On assuming that the
   fluvial surface has a quadratic form, its evolution is determined by
   imposing an overall volume balance, and conditions for the elevations
   and slopes at the domain boundaries. This results in a coupled system,
   involving one ordinary differential equation and one non-linear
   equation. These equations are solved through an explicit Euler time
   stepping algorithm to predict the movement of the shoreline and
   alluvial-bedrock transition boundaries under a wide range of base-level
   change conditions. The mathematics of the approach are verified by
   comparing predictions from the geometric model with a closed form
   solution of a downslope gravity-driven transport model under the
   specific case of a square-root of time base-level change. Testing with
   more general base-level change scenarios reveals that this simple
   geometric mass balance is able to predict system dynamics that are fully
   consistent with both physical and numerical experiments. Moreover, model
   predictions under a base-level cycle (fall-rise) suggest a behavior
   where river incision occurs during the base-level rise stage, a
   predicted dynamic that has not been previously reported. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Repetitive elements comprise a significant portion of most eukaryotic
   genomes. Minisatellites, a type of repetitive element composed of repeat
   units 15-100 bp in length, are stable in actively dividing cells but
   change in composition during meiosis and in stationary-phase cells.
   Alterations within minisatellite tracts have been correlated with the
   onset of a variety of diseases, including diabetes mellitus, myoclonus
   epilepsy, and several types of cancer. However, little is known about
   the factors preventing minisatellite alterations. Previously, our
   laboratory developed a color segregation assay in which a minisatellite
   was inserted into the ADE2 gene in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to
   monitor alteration events. We demonstrated that minisatellite
   alterations that occur in stationary-phase cells give rise to a specific
   colony morphology phenotype known as blebbing. Here, we performed a
   modified version of the synthetic genetic array analysis to screen for
   mutants that produce a blebbing phenotype. Screens were conducted using
   two distinctly different minisatellite tracts: the ade2-min3 construct
   consisting of three identical 20-bp repeats, and the ade2-h7.5
   construct, consisting of seven-and-a-half 28-bp variable repeats.
   Mutations in 102 and 157 genes affect the stability of the ade2-min3 and
   ade2-h7.5 alleles, respectively. Only seven hits overlapped both
   screens, indicating that different factors regulate repeat stability
   depending upon minisatellite size and composition. Importantly, we
   demonstrate that mismatch repair influences the stability of the
   ade2-h7.5 allele, indicating that this type of DNA repair stabilizes
   complex minisatellites in stationary phase cells. Our work provides
   insight into the factors regulating minisatellite stability.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of motion-induced 3-D

   minimal problems, where the unknown 6-degree-of-freedom (DOF)
   transformation between the two robots is determined based on the minimum
   number of measurements necessary to find a finite set of solutions. In
   order to address the very large number of possible combinations of
   interrobot observations, we identify symmetries in the measurement
   sequence and use them to prove that any extrinsic robot-to-robot
   calibration problem can be solved based on the solutions of only 14
   (base) minimal problems. Moreover, we provide algebraic (closed-form)
   and efficient symbolic-numerical (analytical) solution methods to these

Abstract = {{The impact of gasoline price changes on traffic safety has received
   increasing attention in empirical studies. In this study, we use time
   geography to provide a theoretical framework for examining the effects
   of time-varying fluctuations in gasoline prices and their relationship
   to traffic safety in a case study of Mississippi from April 2004 to
   December 2010. Application of time geography theory suggests that
   gasoline prices act as one type of capability constraint of the
   space-time path. As gasoline prices increase (that is, as the capability
   constraint becomes stronger), we hypothesize traffic crash rates
   decrease, and they decrease more for groups for whom the constraint is
   stronger. The results corroborate the hypotheses and suggest that
   gasoline prices have stronger effects on reducing less severe crashes
   and negligible effects on reducing fatal crashes. Gasoline price effects
   on reducing crashes start at a 9-month lag, peak at a 12-month lag, and
   diminish after an 18-month lag. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The long-term outcome of lung transplants is poor with 60\%-70\% of
   patients developing chronic rejection. Chronic rejection is manifested
   histologically by obliterative bronchiolitis with bronchiolitis
   obliterans syndrome (BOS), the clinical surrogate. Recent studies
   suggest that fibroblasts and epithelial cells present in bronchoalveolar
   lavage (BAL) may be a clinically relevant biomarker for BOS. The goal of
   this investigation was to develop a fast, repeatable method to
   individually isolate these low-frequency cell types. Fibroblasts and
   epithelial cells were isolated from BAL using attachment methods and the
   phenotype of the cells confirmed using immunostaining for vimentin
   (fibroblasts) and epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM, epithelial
   cells). Both fibroblasts and epithelial cells were isolated in every
   sample of BAL processed with the frequency of fibroblasts ranging from
   0.03\% to 0.48\% and epithelial cells ranging from 0.05\% to 1.5\% of
   the total sample. Additional studies were performed using cytospins of
   cells after macrophages were depleted; cells exhibiting characteristics
   of both fibroblasts and epithelial cells were observed. The frequency of
   the cells of interest suggests that conventional methods of
   immunomagnetic isolation will not be effective in isolating these
   subpopulations. Finally, some of the low-frequency cells isolated via
   cytospin exhibit characteristics of epithelial to mesenchymal transition
   (which was not observed in plating incubations), indicating that the
   epithelial to mesenchymal cell transition fibroblasts may be
   nonadherent. In future studies, this technique and dataset may be of use
   to statistically correlate low-frequency cell type abundance to the
   onset and development of BOS.}},

Abstract = {{A hard-deadline, opportunistic scheduling problem in which B bits must
   be transmitted within T time slots over a time-varying channel is
   studied: at the beginning of each slot the transmitter must decide how
   many bits to serve, or equivalently how much power to transmit with,
   based on causal channel knowledge where the channel varies from slot to
   slot (i.e., the channel in the current slot is known, but the channels
   in future slots are unknown). The objective of the opportunistic
   scheduling problem is to minimize expected transmission energy. It is
   assumed that no other packets are concurrently scheduled and that the
   transmission rate is equal to the capacity of the underlying additive
   white Gaussian noise channel within each slot, where the channel quality
   is fixed within a slot but varies in from slot to slot. Thus, the
   scheduler should be opportunistic, in the sense of transmitting more
   bits in slot(s) with good channel quality, while also being aware of the
   deadline so that not too many bits are left to the final slot. No
   closed-form solution for the optimal policy is known for this problem,
   which is naturally formulated as a finite-horizon dynamic program, but
   three different policies are shown to be optimal in the limiting regimes
   where T is fixed and B is large, T is fixed and B is small, and where B
   and T are simultaneously taken to infinity. In addition, the advantage
   of optimal scheduling is quantified relative to a nonopportunistic
   (i.e., channel blind) equal-bit policy.}},

Abstract = {{Traditionally, transportation engineering students have used engineering
   drawing techniques to manually lay out lines and curves over contour
   maps for highway geometric design. The design process requires numerous
   calculations of stopping sight distance, minimum turning radius, and
   curve alignments to minimize economic and environmental impact and
   construction costs. Students usually perform iterative computations to
   manually meet design criteria and environmental constraints. The
   traditional approach of learning geometric design is cumbersome and time
   consuming, limiting students from taking a broader perspective on
   geometric design. A new software tool, Roadway Online Application for
   Design (ROAD), was developed to enhance the learning experience for
   transportation engineering students. This tool allows students to design
   roadway geometry efficiently and modify the design easily within given
   economic and environmental parameters. The objective is to provide a
   comprehensive tool that can be accessed easily by students in order to
   help them better understand geometric design. ROAD can also generate a
   three-dimensional roadway geometry model at final design to allow
   students to place themselves in the driver's seat and maneuver through
   the designed roadway at maximum design speed. DOI:

Abstract = {{The unusual properties of shape memory alloys (SMAs) are due to
   solid-to-solid martensitic transformations (MTs) which correspond to a
   lattice level instability of the crystal structure. Currently, there
   exists a shortage of material models of MTs based on the material's
   atomic composition and crystal structure. The present work develops a
   model using first-order self-consistent lattice dynamics (SCLD) that
   captures the qualitative behavior of MTs. The effects of atomic
   vibrations on the material properties are captured by renormalizing the
   frequencies of atomic vibration using self-consistent equations. These
   renormalized frequencies are dependent on both configuration and
   temperature. The model is easily extended to three-dimensional problems.
   The model is illustrated for the case of a one dimensional bi-atomic
   chain. The constant Morse pair potential parameters are chosen to
   demonstrate the usefulness of the SCLD model. The resulting model is
   evaluated by generating equilibrium paths with temperature and
   mechanical load as the loading parameters. In both types of loading, a
   first-order entropically stabilized MT is predicted indicating that the
   current model is able to capture the first-order MTs that occur in SMAs.
   This qualitative prediction of a first-order MT indicates the
   likely-hood that the SCLD model can be used for the computational design
   and discovery of SMAs with better properties. Such an undertaking would
   involve, first, determining the potential parameters of new alloys from
   first-principles calculations and, second, using these parameter values
   with the SCLD to evaluate the shape memory behavior of the new
   previously unstudied materials. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Investigational therapy can be successfully undertaken using viral- and
   nonviral-mediated ex vivo gene transfer. Indeed, recent clinical trials
   have established the potential for genetically modified T cells to
   improve and restore health. Recently, the Sleeping Beauty (SB)
   transposon/transposase system has been applied in clinical trials to
   stably insert a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to redirect T-cell
   specificity. We discuss the context in which the SB system can be
   harnessed for gene therapy and describe the human application of
   SB-modified CAR(+) T cells. We have focused on theoretical issues
   relating to insertional mutagenesis in the context of human genomes that
   are naturally subjected to remobilization of transposons and the
   experimental evidence over the last decade of employing SB transposons
   for defining genes that induce cancer. These findings are put into the
   context of the use of SB transposons in the treatment of human disease.

Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{69}},
Pages = {{345-353}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing may be a useful tool for exploring spatial variability of
   air pollution exposure within an urban area. To evaluate the extent to
   which satellite data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) can
   resolve urban-scale gradients in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2)
   within a large urban area, we compared estimates of surface NO2
   concentrations derived from OMI measurements and US EPA ambient
   monitoring stations. OMI, aboard NASA's Aura satellite, provides daily
   afternoon (similar to 13:30 local time) measurements of NO2 tropospheric
   column abundance. We used scaling factors (surface-to-column ratios) to
   relate satellite column measurements to ground-level concentrations. We
   compared 4138 sets of paired data for 25 monitoring stations in the
   South Coast Air Basin of California for all of 2005. OMI measurements
   include more data gaps than the ground monitors (60\% versus 5\% of
   available data, respectively), owing to cloud contamination and imposed
   limits on pixel size. The spatial correlation between OMI columns and
   corrected in situ measurements is strong (r=0.93 for annual average
   data), indicating that the within-urban spatial signature of surface NO2
   is well resolved by the satellite sensor. Satellite-based surface
   estimates employing scaling factors from an urban model provide a
   reliable measure (annual mean bias: -13\%; seasonal mean bias: <1\%
   {[}spring] to -22\% {[}fall]) of fine-scale surface NO2. We also find
   that OMI provides good spatial density in the study region (average area
   {[}km(2)] per measurement: 730 for the satellite sensor vs. 1100 for the
   monitors). Our findings indicate that satellite observations of NO2 from
   the OMI sensor provide a reliable measure of spatial variability in
   ground-level NO2 exposure for a large urban area. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Small interfering RNA (siRNA) has a huge potential for the treatment or
   prevention of various diseases. However, to realize the therapeutic
   potential of siRNA drugs, efficient, tissue-specific and safe delivery
   technologies must be developed. Here we synthesized two kinds of
   polymers (PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl methacrylate) labeled as
   PEG-b-PAEM or PEA, and guanidinylated PEGylated poly(2-aminoethyl
   methacrylate) marked as PEG-b-PAEM-co-PGEM or PEAG) using atom transfer
   radical polymerization and evaluated their capability of mediating siRNA
   delivery in vitro and in vivo. Both polymers presented excellent siRNA
   encapsulation ability, formed regular nanostructures with siRNA,
   robustly mediated cellular internalization and cytoplasmic localization
   of siRNA, and resulted in targeted gene knockdown efficiently. However,
   PEAG showed much more outstanding abilities referring to above
   evaluating indicators compared with PEA. Both PEA/siRNA and PEAG/siRNA
   polyplexes displayed strong liver, lung and spleen accumulation in mice
   for a long time after intravenous administration. PEAG/siApoB polyplexes
   (single dose at 1 mg/kg) further repressed ApoB expression in liver and
   resulted in block of lipid transportation. In addition, both polymers
   delivered high amounts of siRNA into tumor tissue in the Hela-Luc
   xenograft murine model. More siRNA accumulated in tumor with the
   increase of N/P ratio and PEAG/siRNA polyplexes showed higher siRNA
   accumulation than PEA/siRNA polyplexes at the same NIP ratio. These
   findings set the stage for further studies of structural functional
   mechanisms and developments of siRNA therapeutics. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Maxwell's methodology is combined with the boundary element method (BEM)
   for evaluating the two-dimensional effective elastic properties of
   composite, porous, and microcracked isotropic materials with periodic or
   random structure. The approach is based on the idea that the effective
   properties of the material can be deduced from the effects that a
   cluster of fibers, pores, or cracks embedded in an infinite matrix has
   on the far-fields. The fibers, pores, or cracks can have arbitrary
   shapes, sizes, and elastic properties, provided that the overall
   behavior is isotropic, and their effects are assumed to be the same as
   those of an equivalent circular inhomogeneity. The key aspect of the
   approach is to precisely account for the interactions between all the
   constituents in the cluster that represent the material in question.
   This is done by using the complex-variables version of the BEM to solve
   the problem of a finite cluster of fibers, pores or cracks embedded an
   infinite isotropic, linearly elastic matrix. The effective properties of
   the material are evaluated by comparing the far-field solutions for the
   cluster with that of the equivalent inhomogeneity. It is shown that the
   model adequately captures the influence of the micro-structure of the
   material on its overall properties.}},

   Our results showed that changes in cell volume during freeze/thaw and
   the unfrozen water content in the solution alter the cytoskeleton
   stiffness, and the available membrane material. Combined with
   unfavorable ice-membrane interactions and increasing membrane stiffness,
   increased de-structuring of the membrane (such as bleb and microvilli

Abstract = {{Biorepositories worldwide collect human serum samples and store them for
   future research. Currently, hundreds of biorepositories across the world
   store human serum samples in refrigerators, freezers, or liquid nitrogen
   without following any specific cryopreservation protocol. This method of
   storage is both expensive and potentially detrimental to the
   biospecimens. To decrease both cost of storage and the freeze/thaw
   stresses, we explored the feasibility of storing archival human serum
   samples at non-cryogenic temperatures using isothermal vitrification.
   When biospecimens are vitrified, biochemical reactions can be stopped,
   the specimen ceases to degrade, and macromolecules can be stabilized
   without requiring cryogenic storage. In this study, 0.2, 0.4, or 0.8 M
   trehalose; 0, 0.005 or 0.01 M dextran; and 0 or 10\% (v/v) glycerol was
   added to human serum samples. The samples were either dried diffusively
   as sessile droplets or desiccated under vacuum after they are adsorbed
   onto glass microfiber filters. The glass transition temperatures (T-g)
   of the desiccated samples were measured by temperature-ramp Fourier
   Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Sera samples vitrified at 4 +/-
   2 degrees C when 0.8 M trehalose and 0.01 M dextran were added and the
   samples were vacuum dried for two hours. Western immunoblotting showed
   that vitrified serum proteins were minimally degraded when stored for up
   to one month at 4 degrees C. About 80\% of all proteins were recovered
   after storage at 4 C on glass microfiber filters, and recovery did not
   decrease with storage time. These results demonstrated the feasibility
   of long-term storage of vitrified serum at hypothermic (and
   non-cryogenic) temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comprehensive study of the cracking and
   coalescence behavior of granite specimens with pre-existing flaw pairs.
   Uniaxial compressions tests were conducted on Barre granite with
   pre-existing flaw pairs of varying inclination angles , bridging angles
   and ligament lengths (L). The cracking processes were recorded using a
   high speed camera to capture crack initiation and determine the mode
   (tensile or shear) of cracking. Visible fracture process zones of grain
   lightening, referred to as ``white patching{''}, were also observed.
   White patching corresponded to fracture process zones that developed
   before visible cracks appeared. Cracks were typically preceded by a
   corresponding linear white patching. Diffusive area white patching was
   also observed near locations where surface spalling eventually occurred.
   Shear cracks occurred less often when compared to other brittle
   materials such as gypsum and marble and tensile cracks were typically
   much more jagged in shape (saw-toothed) due to the larger size and
   higher strength mineral grains of granite. Crack coalescence behavior
   trended from indirect to direct shear and combined shear-tensile to
   direct tensile coalescence as the flaw pair bridging angle or flaw angle
   increased. As the ligament length (L) between flaws increased, more
   indirect coalescence was observed. As expected, due to the increased
   occurrence of tensile cracking in granite, more indirect tensile
   coalescence was observed in granite compared to other materials
   previously studied.}},

   interaction of spherical nanoinhomogeneities with Gurtin-Murdoch type

   developed and implemented in an efficient numerical algorithm. The
   method provides accurate evaluation of local fields and effective
   stiffness tensor with the interaction effects fully taken into account.
   The displacement vector within the matrix domain is found as a
   superposition of the vector periodic solutions of Lame equation. By
   using local expansion of the total displacement and stress fields in
   terms of vector spherical harmonics associated with each particle, the
   interface conditions are fulfilled precisely. Analytical averaging of
   the local strain and stress fields in matrix domain yields an exact,
   closed form formula (in terms of expansion coefficients) for the
   effective elastic stiffness tensor of nanocomposite. Numerical results
   demonstrate that elastic stiffness and, especially, brittle strength of
   nanoheterogeneous materials can be substantially improved by an
   appropriate surface modification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The coronary venous system is a highly variable network of veins that
   drain the deoxygenated blood from the myocardium. The system is made up
   of the greater cardiac system, which carries the majority of the
   deoxygenated blood to the right atrium, and the smaller cardiac system,
   which drains the blood directly into the heart chambers. The coronary
   veins are currently being used for several biomedical applications,
   including but not limited to cardiac resynchronization therapy, ablation
   therapy, defibrillation, perfusion therapy, and annuloplasty. Knowledge
   of the details of the coronary venous anatomy is essential for optimal
   development and delivery of treatments using this vasculature. This
   article is part of a JCTR special issue on Cardiac Anatomy.}},

Abstract = {{Within the adult population living with congenital heart defects,
   approximately 20 \% have an atrial septal defect, which suggests that
   only 0.4-0.05 \% of the entire adult population has an atrial septal
   defect (ASD). In patients with a left to right atrial shunt, treatments
   may include closure of the defect with a transcatheter device and/or
   surgical repair. From the perspective of a physician or engineer, it is
   vitally important to understand the anatomical nuances of such defects,
   not only to offer the most optimal treatment for the patient but also to
   call attention to the potential anatomy of ASDs which may go undetected.
   To do so, we reanimated two human hearts deemed not viable for
   transplant from 56-year-old and 68-year-old males. Neither patient
   history reported any heart conditions that would suggest an atrial
   defect, yet an ASD was found in each heart. Here, we present sets of
   images, videos, and 3D reconstructions that provide a clearer view of
   the anatomy of ASDs in functional human hearts. With an enhanced
   understanding of 3D functional aspects of ASDs, physicians can make
   improved decisions regarding treatment options and engineers can
   optimize device designs.}},

Title = {{Anatomical Reconstructions of the Human Cardiac Venous System using
   Contrast-computed Tomography of Perfusion-fixed Specimens}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{74}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A detailed understanding of the complexity and relative variability
   within the human cardiac venous system is crucial for the development of
   cardiac devices that require access to these vessels. For example,
   cardiac venous anatomy is known to be one of the key limitations for the
   proper delivery of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT)(1) Therefore,
   the development of a database of anatomical parameters for human cardiac
   venous systems can aid in the design of CRT delivery devices to overcome
   such a limitation. In this research project, the anatomical parameters
   were obtained from 3D reconstructions of the venous system using
   contrast-computed tomography (CT) imaging and modeling software
   (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). The following parameters were assessed
   for each vein: arc length, tortuousity, branching angle, distance to the
   coronary sinus ostium, and vessel diameter.
   CRT is a potential treatment for patients with electromechanical
   dyssynchrony. Approximately 10-20\% of heart failure patients may
   benefit from CRT2. Electromechanical dyssynchrony implies that parts of
   the myocardium activate and contract earlier or later than the normal
   conduction pathway of the heart. In CRT, dyssynchronous areas of the
   myocardium are treated with electrical stimulation. CRT pacing typically
   involves pacing leads that stimulate the right atrium (RA), right
   ventricle (RV), and left ventricle (LV) to produce more resynchronized
   rhythms. The LV lead is typically implanted within a cardiac vein, with
   the aim to overlay it within the site of latest myocardial activation.
   We believe that the models obtained and the analyses thereof will
   promote the anatomical education for patients, students, clinicians, and
   medical device designers. The methodologies employed here can also be
   utilized to study other anatomical features of our human heart
   specimens, such as the coronary arteries. To further encourage the
   educational value of this research, we have shared the venous models on
   our free access website: www.vhlab.umn.edu/atlas.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent flows are intrinsic to many processes in science and

   critical importance to many fields. However, ongoing efforts to achieve
   a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms of turbulent flow are
   hindered by the difficulty of quantifying the complex, non-linear
   interactions between individual eddies in these flows. The difficulty of
   this task is compounded by the lack of robust methods for accurately
   identifying individual eddy structures and characterizing their dynamic
   evolution and organization across multiple scales. In this paper we
   address this problem by proposing several novel approaches for more
   accurately segmenting individual eddy structures in turbulent flows.}},

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{1-8}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Previously, uniformly a-oriented MFI films were synthesized via the
   secondary growth of an a-oriented seed layer, which was obtained by
   chemically depositing similar to 2 mu m thin-along-the-a-axis particles
   on a silica-coated alpha-Al2O3 porous disc (Choi et al., Angew. Chem.
   Int. Ed. 45 (2006) 1154-1158). Despite the uniformity of the
   a-orientation throughout the film, we found that the MFI membranes are
   not applicable for p-/o-xylene separation since they have significant
   crack and grain boundary defects. Accordingly, a-oriented MFI films were
   fabricated via alternative methods, motivated by the expected high
   separation performance that could be comparable to p-/o-xylene
   separations (100-400 separation factor) of a b-oriented MFI membrane.
   First, smaller 500 nm thin-along-the-a-axis MFI particles (small seeds)
   were used instead of 2 mu m thin-along-the-a-axis particles (large
   seeds) for seed deposition. Second, a seed layer was formed by a
   sonication-assisted physical deposition of the large seeds. Finally, an
   a-oriented seed layer comprising of the large seeds was
   epitaxially-grown to be the a-oriented MFI film by conducting two
   consecutive hydrothermal growth processes. The separation performance of
   the resultant MFI membranes was investigated via n-/i-butane and
   p-/o-xylene permeation tests. Maximum separation factors (SF) of similar
   to 4 and similar to 17 were achieved for p-/o-xylene and n-/i-butane
   isomers, respectively. These values are below the expected performance,
   indicating the presence of non-zeolitic pathways in a-oriented films.

Abstract = {{Rapid antigenic variation of HA, the major virion surface protein of
   influenza A virus, remains the principal challenge to the development of
   broader and more effective vaccines. Some regions of HA, such as the
   stem region proximal to the viral membrane, are nevertheless highly
   conserved across strains and among most subtypes. A fundamental question
   in vaccine design is the extent to which HA stem regions on the surface
   of the virus are accessible to broadly neutralizing antibodies. Here we
   report 3D structures derived from cryoelectron tomography of HA on
   intact 2009 H1N1 pandemic virions in the presence and absence of the
   antibody C179, which neutralizes viruses expressing a broad range of HA
   subtypes, including H1, H2, H5, H6, and H9. By fitting previously
   derived crystallographic structures of trimeric HA into the density
   maps, we deduced the locations of the molecular surfaces of HA involved
   in interaction with C179. Using computational methods to distinguish
   individual unliganded HA trimers from those that have bound C179
   antibody, we demonstrate that similar to 75\% of HA trimers on the
   surface of the virus have C179 bound to the stem domain. Thus, despite
   their close packing on the viral membrane, the majority of HA trimers on
   intact virions are available to bind anti-stem antibodies that target
   conserved HA epitopes, establishing the feasibility of universal
   influenza vaccines that elicit such antibodies.}},

Abstract = {{Despite high predation pressure, planktonic copepods remain one of the
   most abundant groups on the planet. Their escape response provides one
   of most effective mechanisms to maximize evolutionary fitness. Owing to
   their small size (100 mu m) compared with their predators (> 1 mm),
   increasing viscosity is believed to have detrimental effects on
   copepods' fitness at lower temperature. Using high-speed digital
   holography we acquire 3D kinematics of the nauplius escape including
   both location and detailed appendage motion. By independently varying
   temperature and viscosity we demonstrate that at natural thermal
   extremes, contrary to conventional views, nauplii achieve equivalent
   escape distance while maintaining optimal velocity. Using experimental
   results and kinematic simulations from a resistive force theory
   propulsion model, we demonstrate that a shift in appendage timing
   creates an increase in power stroke duration relative to recovery stroke
   duration. This change allows the nauplius to limit losses in velocity
   and maintain distance during escapes at the lower bound of its natural
   thermal range. The shift in power stroke duration relative to recovery
   stroke duration is found to be regulated by the temperature dependence
   of swimming appendage muscle groups, not a dynamic response to viscosity
   change. These results show that copepod nauplii have natural adaptive
   mechanisms to compensate for viscosity variations with temperature but
   not in situations in which viscosity varies independent of temperature,
   such as in some phytoplankton blooms. Understanding the robustness of
   escapes in the wake of environmental changes such as temperature and
   viscosity has implications in assessing the future health of performance
   compensation.}},

Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{A topographical representation for frequency has been identified
   throughout the auditory brain in animals but with limited evidence in
   humans. Using a midbrain implant, we identified an ordering of pitch
   percepts for electrical stimulation of sites across the human inferior
   colliculus (IC) that was consistent with the IC tonotopy shown in
   animals. Low pitches were perceived by the subject for stimulation of
   superficial IC sites while higher pitches were perceived for stimulation
   of deeper sites. Interestingly, this pitch ordering was not initially
   observed for stimulation across the IC, possibly due to central changes
   caused by prior hearing loss. Daily implant stimulation for about 4
   months altered the pitch percepts from being predominantly low to
   exhibiting the expected ordering across the stimulated IC. A presumably
   normal tonotopic representation may have been maintained within the IC
   or accessible through IC stimulation that helped form this pitch
   ordering perceived in higher centers.}},

Title = {{Remediation to improve infiltration into compact soils}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},
Pages = {{85-95}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Urban development usually involves soil compaction through converting
   large pervious land into developed land. This change typically increases
   runoff during runoff events and consequently may add to flooding and
   additional volume of runoff. The wash off of pollutants may also create
   numerous water quality and environmental problems for receiving waters.
   To alleviate this problem many municipalities are considering low impact
   development. One technique to reduce runoff in an urban area is to
   improve the soil infiltration. This study is specifically undertaken to
   investigate tilling and compost addition to improve infiltration rate,
   and to investigate measurement tools to assess the effectiveness of
   remediated soil.
   Soil remediation was performed at three sites in an urban area
   metropolitan area. Each site was divided into three plots: tilled,
   tilled with compost addition, and a control plot with no treatment. The
   infiltration effectiveness within each plot was assessed by measuring
   saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) using the modified Philip Dunne
   (MPD) infiltrometer during pre- and post-treatment. In addition, the use
   of soil bulk density and soil strength as surrogate parameters for K-sat
   was investigated.
   Results showed that deep tillage was effective at reducing the level of
   soil strength. Soil strength was approximately half that of the control
   plot in the first six inches of soil. At two of the sites, tilling was
   also ineffective at improving the infiltration capacity of the soil. The
   geometric mean of K-sat was 0.5-2.3 times that of the control plot,
   indicating little overall improvement. Compost addition was more
   effective than tilling by reducing the soil strength and compaction and
   increasing soil infiltration. The geometric mean of K-sat on the compost
   plots was 2.7-5.7 times that of the control plot. No strong correlations
   were observed before remediation between either soil bulk density or
   soil strength and K-sat. Simulation results showed that the amount of
   runoff generated from a selection of design storms for treated soil was
   less than for untreated soil. The results presented in this study may be
   used as guidance for urban hydromodification and stormwater management
   plans. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft-mounted hyperspectral spectrometers were used to collect
   imagery with high spatial and spectral resolution for use in measuring
   optically active water quality characteristics of major rivers of
   Minnesota. Ground-based sampling undertaken concurrent with image
   acquisition provided calibration data for chlorophyll, suspended solids,
   turbidity and other measures of water clarity. Our approach identified
   the spectral characteristics that distinguish waters dominated by
   several inherent optical properties (IOPs), and we used those
   characteristics to develop models to map water quality characteristics
   in optically complex waters. For phytoplankton related variables
   (volatile suspended solids (VSS) and chlorophyll a (chl a)), the ratios
   of the scattering peak at the red edge (similar to 700 nm) with the
   reflectance troughs caused by chlorophyll absorption at similar to 670
   nm and other plant pigment absorption peaks at 592 and 620 nm all were
   strong predictors of chl a and VSS (r(2) values of 0.73-0.94). The
   scattering peak at similar to 700 nm was a strong predictor of variables
   related to water clarity (total suspended solids (TSS), turbidity and
   turbidity tube (T-tube)) (r(2) values of 0.77-0.93). For mineral-based
   variables (nonvolatile suspended solids (NVSS) and the ratio NVSS:TSS),
   combinations of the TSS and chl a relationships described above were
   strong predictors (r(2) values of 0.73-0.97) and the most robust because
   this model corrects for the scattering of phytoplankton at similar to
   700 nm. Application of the methods to quantify spatial variations in
   water quality for stretches of the Mississippi River and its tributaries
   indicate that hyperspectral imagery can be used to distinguish and map
   key variables under complex IOP conditions, particularly to separate and
   map inorganic suspended sediments independently of chlorophyll levels.

Abstract = {{The production of biofuels from cellulosic biomass is a promising
   technology for developing a renewable source of energy. Efforts to
   produce ethanol from cellulosic biomass using microbes, such as the
   yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, face major challenges, including the
   need for detoxification. Here, we apply a strategy to discover genetic
   alterations that lead to improved robustness of S. cerevisiae in the
   presence of acetate, which is present at toxic concentrations in
   hemicellulose hydrolysates. Acetate in its protonated form (acetic acid)
   enters the cell through passive diffusion and dissociates into a proton
   and acetate, acidifying the cytosol and inhibiting cell function, an
   effect that is exacerbated in the presence of sodium. Through flow
   cytometry analysis, implemented as part of a novel cell culture
   technique, the Cytostat, we characterized the deleterious effects of
   sodium acetate on growth and on cell size homeostasis. Further, using
   the Cytostat to screen a genome-wide, gene overexpression library, we
   identified that overexpressing the ENA2 gene, a P-type sodium pump
   ATPase, provides a significant growth improvement in the presence of
   sodium acetate. Together, our data support the proposed mechanism for
   the synergistic growth inhibition exerted by acetate and sodium, as well
   as the mechanism that develops resistance. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Volume = {{135}},

Abstract = {{Advanced premixed compression ignition (CI) combustion using fumigation
   has been shown to yield significant improvements in indicated efficiency
   over traditional diesel combustion strategies while simultaneously
   reducing engine-out soot and NOx emissions. To better interpret these
   findings, a breakdown of the ways in which actual performance deviates
   from ideal engine cycles is helpful. Nonideal combustion phasing is one
   cause of such deviations. In this paper, the centroid of the calculated
   apparent heat release rate is used to estimate an adjusted maximum
   possible thermal efficiency based on constant volume combustion using an
   effective compression ratio concept. Using these metrics, experimental
   engine data are evaluated from a single cylinder direct-injection diesel
   engine operating in premixed CI mode enabled by gasoline fumigation and
   a diesel pilot injection. Indicated gross cycle efficiency was found to
   be higher for premixed fumigation compared with a conventional diesel
   condition at the same load. A key finding of the work is that the peak
   indicated cycle efficiency for fumigated premixed CI combustion occurs
   with combustion phased very close to top dead center. Shorter heat
   release duration and lower heat losses from the cylinder are thought to
   be the cause of differences in cycle efficiency between conventional
   combustion and premixed CI fumigation modes.}},

Abstract = {{Over 400,000 total knee replacement procedures (TKR) are performed
   annually in the United States. This paper focuses on the development of
   a battery-less wireless instrumented tibial tray for performance
   feedback in TKR implants. The proposed instrumented tibial tray is
   powered internally by an integrated piezoelectric energy harvesting
   system. Energy is harvested during the walking of the patient when
   forces are exerted on the tibial component. The sensors and wireless
   electronics are entirely powered from the harvested energy. This tibial
   tray is also instrumented with capacitive force sensors and an ultra
   low-power method to measure the capacitive force sensors. A bench top
   test rig is developed for testing the battery-less wireless knee
   replacement implant. For a person with a body weight of 55 kg, the
   energy harvesting system can fully charge the storage capacitors in 11
   steps and can harvest an average of 1051 mu J per step. To power the
   force measurement system for ten seconds and to transmit the data, the
   piezoelectric energy harvesting system must be charged before the force
   measurement process is initiated by a minimum of 11 steps and a minimum
   of two steps must be taken during the force measurement process. During
   the force measurement process, each force sensor is sampled at a
   frequency of 10 Hz for ten seconds; thereafter, all of the data is
   transmitted to the RF base station. The resulting capacitive force
   sensors adequately represented cyclic loads; however, the sensors
   demonstrated some issues with repeatability.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-engineered heart valves (TEHV) have been proposed as a promising
   solution for the clinical needs of pediatric patients. In vivo studies
   have shown TEHV leaflet contraction and regurgitation after several
   months of implantation. This has been attributed to contractile cells
   utilized to produce the extracellular matrix (ECM) during TEHV culture.
   Here, we utilized such cells to develop a mature ECM in a fibrin-based
   scaffold that generates commissural alignment in TEHV leaflets and then
   removed these cells using detergents. Further, we evaluated
   recellularization with potentially noncontractile cells. A
   tissue-engineered leaflet model was developed with mechanical anisotropy
   and tensile properties comparable to an ovine pulmonary valve leaflet.
   No change in tensile properties occurred after decellularization using
   1\% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 1\% Triton detergent treatment. Cell
   removal was verified by DNA quantitation and western blot analysis for
   cellular proteins. Histological and scanning electron microscope imaging
   showed no significant change in the ECM organization and microstructure.
   We further tested the recellularization potential of decellularized
   leaflets by seeding human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC) on the surface
   of the leaflets and evaluated them at 1 and 3 weeks in two culture
   conditions. One medium (M1) was chosen to maintain the MSC phenotype
   while a second medium (M2) was used to potentially differentiate cells
   to an interstitial cell phenotype. Cellular quantitation showed that the
   engineered leaflets were recellularized to the highest concentration
   with M2 followed by M1, with minimum cell invasion of decellularized
   native leaflets. Histology showed cellular invasion throughout the
   thickness of the leaflets in M2 and partial invasion in M1. hMSC stained
   positive for MSC markers, but also for alpha-smooth muscle actin in both
   media at 1 week, with no presence of MSC markers at 3 weeks with the
   exception of CD90. These results show that engineered leaflets, while
   having similar tensile properties and collagen content compared to
   native leaflets, have better recellularization potential.}},

Abstract = {{Sequence alignment using evolutionary profiles is a commonly employed
   tool when investigating a protein. Many profile-profile scoring
   functions have been developed for use in such alignments, but there has
   not yet been a comprehensive study of Pareto optimal pairwise alignments
   for combining multiple such functions. We show that the problem of
   generating Pareto optimal pairwise alignments has an optimal
   substructure property, and develop an efficient algorithm for generating
   Pareto optimal frontiers of pairwise alignments. All possible sets of
   two, three, and four profile scoring functions are used from a pool of
   11 functions and applied to 588 pairs of proteins in the ce\_ref data
   set. The performance of the best objective combinations on ce\_ref is
   also evaluated on an independent set of 913 protein pairs extracted from
   the BAliBASE RV11 data set. Our dynamic-programming-based heuristic
   approach produces approximated Pareto optimal frontiers of pairwise
   alignments that contain comparable alignments to those on the exact
   frontier, but on average in less than 1/58th the time in the case of
   four objectives. Our results show that the Pareto frontiers contain
   alignments whose quality is better than the alignments obtained by
   single objectives. However, the task of identifying a single
   high-quality alignment among those in the Pareto frontier remains
   challenging.}},

Abstract = {{Object recognition algorithms often focus on determining the class of a
   detected object in a scene. Two significant phases are usually involved
   in object recognition. The first phase is the object representation
   phase, in which the most suitable features that provide the best
   discriminative power under constraints such as lighting, resolution,
   scale, and view variations are chosen to describe the objects. The
   second phase is to use this representation space to develop models for
   each object class using discriminative classifiers. In this paper, we
   focus on composite objects, i.e., objects with two or more simpler
   classes that are interconnected in a complicated manner. One classic
   example of such a scenario is a bicyclist. A bicyclist consists of a
   bicycle and a human who rides the bicycle. When we are faced with the
   task of classifying bicyclists and pedestrians, it is counterintuitive
   and often hard to come up with a discriminative classifier to
   distinguish the two classes. We explore global image analysis based on
   bag of visual words to compare the results with local image analysis, in
   which we attempt to distinguish the individual parts of the composite
   object. We also propose a unified naive Bayes framework and a combined
   histogram feature method for combining the individual classifiers for
   enhanced performance.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of rollover prevention and yaw stability control
   objectives in electronic stability control (ESC) has traditionally been
   done based on a priority calculation. The control system nominally
   focuses on yaw stability control until a danger of rollover is detected.
   When a danger of rollover is detected, the control system switches from
   yaw stability control to rollover prevention. This paper focuses on an
   integrated ESC system wherein the objectives of yaw stability and
   rollover prevention are addressed simultaneously, rather than one at a
   time. First, we show that staying on a desired planar trajectory at a
   specified speed results in an invariant rollover index. This implies
   that rollover prevention can be achieved whenever there is a danger of
   rollover only by reducing vehicle speed, since changing the desired
   vehicle trajectory is not a desirable option. In this regard, it is
   shown that a vehicle that reduces its speed before entering a sharp
   curve performs significantly better than a vehicle that uses
   differential braking during the turn for yaw stability control. Second,
   this paper explores how the use of steer-by-wire technology can address
   the tradeoff between yaw stability, speed, and rollover prevention
   performance. It is shown that the use of traditional steer-by-wire
   simply as an additional actuator cannot by itself ameliorate the
   tradeoff. However, this tradeoff can be eliminated if steer-by-wire is
   used to invert the direction of the roll angle of the vehicle. A new
   steer-by-wire algorithm that uses transient countersteering is shown to
   change the location of the rollover dynamics from the neighborhood of an
   unstable to a stable equilibrium. In this case, a desired trajectory can
   indeed be achieved by the vehicle at the same speed with a much smaller
   danger of rollover. This is a novel and viable approach to integrating
   the yaw stability and rollover prevention functions and eliminating the
   inherent tradeoffs in the performance of both.}},

Title = {{Effective localized collection and identification of airborne species
   through electrodynamic precipitation and SERS-based detection}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Various nanostructured sensor designs currently aim to achieve or claim
   single molecular detection by a reduction of the active sensor size.
   However, a reduction of the sensor size has the negative effect of
   reducing the capture probability considering the diffusion-based analyte
   transport commonly used. Here we introduce and apply a localized
   programmable electrodynamic precipitation concept as an alternative to
   diffusion. The process provides higher collection rates of airborne
   species and detection at lower concentration. As an example, we compare
   an identical nanostructured surfaced-enhanced Raman spectroscopy sensor
   with and without localized delivery and find that the sensitivity and
   detection time is improved by at least two orders of magnitudes.
   Localized collection in an active-matrix array-like fashion is also
   tested, yielding hybrid molecular arrays on a single chip over a broad
   range of molecular weights, including small benzenethiol (110.18 Da) and
   4-fluorobenzenethiol (128.17 Da), or large macromolecules such as
   anti-mouse IgG (similar to 150 kDa).}},

Abstract = {{The topology of river networks has been a subject of intense research in
   hydro-geomorphology, with special attention to self-similar (SS)
   structures that allow one to develop concise representations and scaling
   frameworks for hydrological fluxes. Tokunaga self-similar (TSS) networks
   represent a particularly popular two-parameter class of self-similar
   models, commonly accepted in hydrology but rarely tested rigorously. In
   this paper we (a) present a statistical framework for testing the TSS
   assumption and estimating the Tokunaga parameters; (b) present an
   improved method for estimating the Horton ratios using the Tokunaga
   parameters; (c) evaluate the proposed testing and estimation frameworks
   using synthetic TSS networks with a broad range of parameters; (d)
   perform self-similar analysis of 408 river networks of maximum order
   Omega >= 6 from 50 catchments across the US; and (e) use the Tokunaga
   parameters as discriminatory metrics to explore climate effects on
   network topology. We find that the TSS assumption cannot be rejected in
   the majority of the examined river networks. The theoretical expression
   for the Horton ratios based on the estimated Tokunaga parameters in the
   TSS networks provides a significantly better approximation to the true
   ratios than the conventional linear regression approach. A correlation
   analysis shows that the Tokunaga parameter c, which determines the
   degree of side-branching, exhibits significant dependence on the
   hydroclimatic variables of the basin: storm frequency, storm duration,
   and mean annual rainfall, offering the possibility of relating climate
   to landscape dissection. While other possible physical controls have
   been neglected in this study, this result is intriguing and warrants
   further analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Using Monte Carlo simulations of a touching-bead model of
   double-stranded DNA, we show that DNA extension is enhanced in isosceles
   triangular nanochannels (relative to a circular nanochannel of the same
   effective size) due to entropic depletion in the channel corners. The
   extent of the enhanced extension depends non-monotonically on both the
   accessible area of the nanochannel and the apex angle of the triangle.
   We also develop a metric to quantify the extent of entropic depletion,
   thereby collapsing the extension data for circular, square, and various
   triangular nanochannels onto a single master curve for channel sizes in
   the transition between the Odijk and de Gennes regimes. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{If venture capital's role in clean energy is to be more transformative
   in creating a sustainable society then the trends we reveal in this
   paper must gain momentum, but whether these trends will continue to gain
   momentum is not certain. We therefore encourage organization and natural
   environment scholars to follow up on the claims we make in this paper
   and pursue the questions we raise further. This paper reviews both the
   potential and the limitations of venture capital (VC) as a source of
   funding for clean energy. We provide preliminary evidence that venture
   capitalists (VCs) have been adjusting their operating procedures to
   accommodate clean energy. First, they have been investing larger amounts
   of money for longer periods of time. Second, they have started to avoid
   funding high risk production, distribution, and installation
   manufacturing and production companies and to a greater degree have been
   funding companies that focus on the intersection between information
   technology and energy. Third, besides making bigger bets, stretching out
   their timetables, and avoiding high risk and capital intensive
   companies, they have been experimenting with investments in companies
   with very risky technologies. Were these companies to succeed in
   commercializing these technologies the impact on the natural environment
   would be very great. We challenge organization and natural environment
   scholars to take up questions like these and others that deal with clean
   energy funding. Amongst a number of possible funding sources, what role
   is venture capital best suited to play? How would it need to change to
   play a more significant role? What would have to happen for venture
   capital to stimulate a major breakthrough, one that was of the magnitude
   of the Internet in transforming our economy and society in a more
   sustainable direction?.}},

Abstract = {{Trimethylation of histone H3 Lys-27 (H3K27me3) plays a critical role in
   regulating gene expression during plant and animal development. We
   characterized the genome-wide distribution of H3K27me3 in five
   developmentally distinct tissues in maize (Zea mays) plants of two
   genetic backgrounds, B73 and Mo17. There were more substantial
   differences in the genome-wide profile of H3K27me3 between different
   tissues than between the two genotypes. The tissue-specific patterns of
   H3K27me3 were often associated with differences in gene expression among
   the tissues and most of the imprinted genes that are expressed solely
   from the paternal allele in endosperm are targets of H3K27me3. A
   comparison of the H3K27me3 targets in rice (Oryza sativa), maize, and
   Arabidopsis thaliana provided evidence for conservation of the H3K27me3
   targets among plant species. However, there was limited evidence for
   conserved targeting of H3K27me3 in the two maize subgenomes derived from
   whole-genome duplication, suggesting the potential for
   subfunctionalization of chromatin regulation of paralogs. Genomic
   profiling of H3K27me3 in loss-of-function mutant lines for Maize
   Enhancer of zeste-like2 (Mez2) and Mez3, two of the three putative
   H3K27me3 methyltransferases present in the maize genome, suggested
   partial redundancy of this gene family for maintaining H3K27me3
   patterns. Only a portion of the targets of H3K27me3 required Mez2 and/or
   Mez3, and there was limited evidence for functional consequences of
   H3K27me3 at these targets.}},

Abstract = {{Acute promyelocytic leukemia is characterized by a chromosomal
   translocation involving the retinoic acid receptor alpha gene. To
   identify co-operating pathways to leukemogenesis, we crossed
   MRP8-PML/RARA transgenic mice with BXH-2 mice which harbor an endogenous
   murine leukemia virus that causes acute myeloid leukemia. Approximately
   half of the leukemias that arose in this cross showed features of acute
   promyelocytic leukemia. We identified 22 proviral insertion sites in
   acute promyelocytic-like leukemias and focused our analysis on insertion
   at Sox4, a HMG box transcription factor. Using a transplant model,
   co-operation between PML-RAR alpha and Sox4 was confirmed with increased
   penetrance and reduced latency of disease. Interestingly, kaiyotypic
   analysis revealed cytogenetic changes suggesting that the factors
   combined to initiate but not complete leukemic transformation. The
   cooperation between these transcription factors is consistent with the
   paradigm of multiple routes to the disease and reinforces the concept
   that transcription factor networks are important therapeutic targets in
   myeloid leukemias.}},

Abstract = {{Extreme events occur rarely, but these are often the circumstances where
   an insurance coverage is demanded. Given the first, say, n moments of
   the risk(s) of the events, one is able to compute or approximate the
   tight bounds for risk measures in the form of E (psi(x)) through
   semidefinite programmings (SDP), via distributional robust optimization
   formulations. Existing results in the literature have already
   demonstrated the power of this technique when psi(x) is linear or
   piecewise linear. In this paper, we extend the technique in the case
   where psi(x) is a polynomial or fractional polynomial. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chromatogram overlays are frequently used to monitor inter-batch
   performance of bioprocess purification steps. However, the objective
   analysis of chromatograms is difficult due to peak shifts caused by
   variable phase durations or unexpected process holds. Furthermore,
   synchronization of batch process data may also be required prior to
   performing multivariate analysis techniques. Dynamic time warping was
   originally developed as a method for spoken word recognition, but shows
   potential in the objective analysis of time variant signals, such as
   manufacturing data. In this work we will discuss the application of
   dynamic time warping with a derivative weighting function to align
   chromatograms to facilitate process monitoring and fault detection. In
   addition, we will demonstrate the utility of this method as a
   preprocessing step for multivariate model development. (c) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Understanding how proposed medical devices will interface with humans is
   a major challenge that impacts both the design of innovative new devices
   and approval and regulation of existing devices. Today, designing and
   manufacturing medical devices requires extensive and expensive product
   cycles. Bench tests and other preliminary analyses are used to
   understand the range of anatomical conditions, and animal and clinical
   trials are used to understand the impact of design decisions upon actual
   device success. Unfortunately, some scenarios are impossible to
   replicate on the bench, and competitive pressures often accelerate
   initiation of animal trials without sufficient understanding of
   parameter selections. We believe that these limitations can be overcome
   through advancements in data-driven and simulation-based medical device
   design and manufacturing, a research topic that draws upon and combines
   emerging work in the areas of Regulatory Science and Big Data. We
   propose a cross-disciplinary grand challenge to develop and holistically
   apply new thinking and techniques in these areas to medical devices in
   order to improve and accelerate medical device innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrite FeS2 is receiving a resurgence of Interest as a uniquely
   attractive thin film solar absorber based on abundant, lowcost, nontoxic
   elements. Here we address, via ex situ suifidation synthesis, the
   long-standing problem of understanding conduction and doping in FeS2
   films, an elusive prerequisite to successful solar cells. We find that
   an abrupt improvement in crystallinity at Intermediate sulfidation
   temperatures is accompanied by unanticipated crossovers from
   intergranular hopping to conventional transport, and, remarkably, from
   hole-like to electron-like Hall coefficients. The hopping is found to
   occur between a small volume fraction of conductive nanoscopic
   sulfur-deficient grain cores (beneath our X-ray diffraction detection
   limits), embedded in nominally stoichlometric FeS2. In addition to
   placing constraints on the conditions under which useful properties can
   be obtained from FeS2 synthesized In diffusion-limited situations, these
   results also emphasize that FeS2 films are not universally p-type.
   Indeed, with no knowledge of the active transport mechanism we
   demonstrate that the Hall coefficient alone is insufficient to determine
   the sign of the carriers. These results elucidate the possible transport
   mechanisms In thin film FeS2 in addition to their influence on the
   deduced carrier type, an enabling advancement with respect to
   understanding and controlling doping in pyrite films.}},

Abstract = {{The development of biofuels produced from biomass-derived pyrolysis oils
   (bio-oil) requires a deeper understanding of the bio-oil vaporization
   required for catalytic hydrodeoxygenation, reforming and combustion
   processes. Through the use of high-speed photography, bio-oil droplets
   on a 500 degrees C alumina disk in nitrogen gas were observed to undergo
   violent microexplosions capable of rapidly dispersing the fuel. High
   speed photography of the entire droplet lifetime was used to determine
   explosion times, frequency and evaporation rates of the bio-oil samples
   that have been preprocessed by filtering or addition of methanol.
   Filtration of the oil prior to evaporation significantly reduced the
   fraction of droplets that explode from 50\% to below 5\%. Addition of
   methanol to bio-oil led to uniform vaporization while also increasing
   the fraction of droplets that exploded. Experiments support the
   necessity of dissolvable solids for the formation of a volatile core and
   heavy shell which ruptures and rapidly expands to produce a violent
   bio-oil microexplosion.}},

Abstract = {{Visible and near-infrared properties of optically thick ceria ceramics
   encountered in solar-driven thermochemical cycles are determined in the
   wavelength range 035-2 mu m by employing a novel methodology. The
   methodology consists of an analytical solution based on the modified
   two-flux approximation and the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method. The
   analytical solution is used to identify transport scattering albedo from
   normal-hemispherical reflectance of optically thick samples. The Monte
   Carlo ray-tracing method is used to obtain transport scattering
   coefficient in the near-infrared wavelength range 0.9-1.4 mu m from
   hi-normal narrow-cone transmittance. Mie theory is employed to obtain
   transport scattering coefficient in an extended spectral range. Further,
   the index of absorption of ceria (cerium dioxide) is estimated by the
   additive relation for optically soft materials in a short-wave part of
   the near-infrared range. The proposed methodology is suitable for
   problems where traditional identification procedures have limited
   applicability because of highly scattering, optically thick materials
   and unknown index of absorption in the spectral range of weak
   absorption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we examine the optical properties of tin naphthalocyanine
   dichloride (SnNcCl(2)), and its performance as an electron donor
   material in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). As an active material,
   SnNcCl(2) is attractive for its narrow energy gap which facilitates
   optical absorption past a wavelength of lambda = 1100 nm. We demonstrate
   a power conversion efficiency of eta(P) = (1.2 +/- 0.1)\% under
   simulated AM1.5G solar illumination at 100 mW/cm(2) using the electron
   donor-acceptor pairing of SnNcCl(2) and C-60 in a bilayer device
   architecture. While some phthalocyanines have been previously used to
   improve infrared absorption, this is often realized through the
   formation of molecular dimers. In SnNcCl(2), the infrared absorption is
   intrinsic to the molecule, arising as a result of the extended
   conjugation. Consequently, it is expected that SnNcCl(2) could be
   utilized in bulk heterojunction OPVs without sacrificing infrared
   absorption. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Sequence Context Dependence of Polymerase Kinetic}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{DNA modifications such as methylation and DNA damage can play critical
   regulatory roles in biological systems. Single molecule, real time
   (SMRT) sequencing technology generates DNA sequences as well as DNA
   polymerase kinetic information that can be used for the direct detection
   of DNA modifications. We demonstrate that local sequence context has a
   strong impact on DNA polymerase kinetics in the neighborhood of the
   incorporation site during the DNA synthesis reaction, allowing for the
   possibility of estimating the expected kinetic rate of the enzyme at the
   incorporation site using kinetic rate information collected from
   existing SMRT sequencing data (historical data) covering the same local
   sequence contexts of interest. We develop an Empirical Bayesian
   hierarchical model for incorporating historical data. Our results show
   that the model could greatly increase DNA modification detection
   accuracy, and reduce requirement of control data coverage. For some DNA
   modifications that have a strong signal, a control sample is not even
   needed by using historical data as alternative to control. Thus,
   sequencing costs can be greatly reduced by using the model. We
   implemented the model in a R package named seqPatch, which is available

Title = {{Network-based Survival Analysis Reveals Subnetwork Signatures for
   Predicting Outcomes of Ovarian Cancer Treatment}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Cox regression is commonly used to predict the outcome by the time to an
   event of interest and in addition, identify relevant features for
   survival analysis in cancer genomics. Due to the high-dimensionality of
   high-throughput genomic data, existing Cox models trained on any
   particular dataset usually generalize poorly to other independent
   datasets. In this paper, we propose a network-based Cox regression model
   called Net-Cox and applied Net-Cox for a large-scale survival analysis
   across multiple ovarian cancer datasets. Net-Cox integrates gene network
   information into the Cox's proportional hazard model to explore the
   co-expression or functional relation among high-dimensional gene
   expression features in the gene network. Net-Cox was applied to analyze
   three independent gene expression datasets including the TCGA ovarian
   cancer dataset and two other public ovarian cancer datasets. Net-Cox
   with the network information from gene co-expression or functional
   relations identified highly consistent signature genes across the three
   datasets, and because of the better generalization across the datasets,
   Net-Cox also consistently improved the accuracy of survival prediction
   over the Cox models regularized by L-2-norm or L-1-norm. This study
   focused on analyzing the death and recurrence outcomes in the treatment
   of ovarian carcinoma to identify signature genes that can more reliably
   predict the events. The signature genes comprise dense protein-protein
   interaction subnetworks, enriched by extracellular matrix receptors and
   modulators or by nuclear signaling components downstream of
   extracellular signal-regulated kinases. In the laboratory validation of
   the signature genes, a tumor array experiment by protein staining on an
   independent patient cohort from Mayo Clinic showed that the protein
   expression of the signature gene FBN1 is a biomarker significantly
   associated with the early recurrence after 12 months of the treatment in
   the ovarian cancer patients who are initially sensitive to chemotherapy.

Abstract = {{Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has been proposed to destroy large
   amounts of tumorous tissue and shows advantages over thermal therapies.
   Unfortunately, carefully constructed studies assessing impact in in vivo
   tumor systems and a direct comparison of IRE with thermal therapy are
   lacking. In this study, we investigate the effect of IRE in a human
   prostate cancer (LNCaP) grown in a thin, essentially two-dimensional,
   dorsal skin fold chamber system. Detailed experimental characterizations
   of the electrical and thermal responses of the tissue were performed
   yielding the first thermal response measurement in vivo of its kind that
   we are aware of. The interaction and coupling of electrical and thermal
   responses were further discussed. The threshold of the tumor injury was
   determined for human prostate tumor model, and the threshold value
   (600-1300 V cm(-1)) is dependent on the IRE parameters including pulse
   duration and pulse number. This dependence was explained in the context
   of tissue electrical conductivity change during IRE. Further, the
   thermal injury was found not to be a dominant factor in IRE with our
   system, which is in agreement with previous numerical studies. Finally,
   it appears that the local electrical heterogeneity of the tumor tissue
   reduces the effectiveness of IRE in some sections of the tumor (leading
   to live tumor patches).}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is a
   technique proposed to reconstruct the conductivity distribution in
   biological tissue at ultrasound imaging resolution. A magnetic pulse is
   used to generate eddy currents in the object, which in the presence of a
   static magnetic field induces Lorentz force based acoustic waves in the
   medium. This time resolved acoustic waves are collected with ultrasound
   transducers and, in the present work, these are used to reconstruct the
   current source which gives rise to the MAT-MI acoustic signal using
   vector imaging point spread functions. The reconstructed source is then
   used to estimate the conductivity distribution of the object. Computer
   simulations and phantom experiments are performed to demonstrate
   conductivity reconstruction through vector source imaging in a circular
   scanning geometry with a limited bandwidth finite size piston
   transducer. The results demonstrate that the MAT-MI approach is capable
   of conductivity reconstruction in a physical setting.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a local oscillator (LO) generation scheme for a
   21-GHz center-frequency 4-GHz instantaneous bandwidth channelized

   generate 20- and 22-GHz LOs with quadrature outputs. Injection locking
   is used instead of conventional phase-locked loop techniques allowing
   low-power quadrature generation. A harmonic-rich signal, containing both
   even and odd harmonics of the input reference signal, is generated using
   a digital pulse slimmer. Two injection-locked oscillator chains are used
   to lock on to the 10th and 11th harmonics of the reference signal
   generating the 20- and 22-GHz quadrature LOs, respectively. The
   prototype design is implemented in IBM's 130-nm CMOS process, draws 110
   mA from a 1.2-V supply, and occupies an active area of 1.8 mm.(2)}},

Abstract = {{Consider a unicast downlink beamforming optimization problem with robust
   signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints to account for
   imperfect channel state information at the base station in a
   multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system. The convexity
   of this robust beamforming problem remains unknown. A slightly
   conservative version of the robust beamforming problem is thus studied
   herein as a compromise. It is in the form of a semi-infinite
   second-order cone program (SOCP) and, more importantly, it possesses an
   equivalent and explicit convex reformulation, due to a linear matrix
   inequality (LMI) description of the cone of Lorentz-positive maps.
   Hence, the conservative robust beamforming problem can be efficiently
   solved by an optimization solver. Additional robust shaping constraints
   can also be easily handled to control the amount of interference
   generated on other co-existing users such as in cognitive radio systems.}},

Abstract = {{A central challenge for printed electronics is to achieve high operating
   frequencies (short transistor switching times) at low supply biases
   compatible with thin film batteries. In this report, we demonstrate
   partially printed five-stage ring oscillators with >20 kHz operating
   frequencies and stage delays <5 mu s at supply voltages below 3 V. The
   fastest ring oscillator achieved 1.2 mu s delay time at 2 V supply. The
   inverter stages in these ring oscillators were based on ambipolar thin
   film transistors (TFTs) employing semiconducting, single-walled carbon
   nanotube (CNT) networks and a high capacitance (similar to 1 mu F/cm(2))
   ion gel electrolyte as the gate dielectric. All materials except the
   source and drain electrodes were aerosol jet printed. The TFTs exhibited
   high electron and hole mobilities (similar to 20 cm(2)/(V s)) and ON/OFF
   current ratios (up to 10(5)). Inverter switching times t were
   systematically characterized as a function of transistor channel length
   and ionic conductivity of the gel dielectric, demonstrating that both
   the semiconductor and the ion gel play a role in switching speed.
   Quantitative scaling analysis suggests that with suitable optimization
   low voltage, printed ion gel gated CNT inverters could operate at
   frequencies on the order of 1 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{A simple analytic correction is derived for the maximum efficiency of an
   ideal wind turbine rotor, the BetzJoukowsky limit. The analytic
   correction accounts for the effect that the non-uniform atmospheric
   boundary layer velocity distribution has on the BetzJoukowsky
   derivation. The maximum power coefficient predicted by using the
   atmospheric boundary layer velocity profile is slightly higher than that
   predicted by using a uniform velocity distribution. The application of
   the correction to a 100m rotor diameter at 80m hub height in a neutrally
   stratified boundary layer flow predicts a maximum power increase of
   12\%, depending on the approach terrain. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley
