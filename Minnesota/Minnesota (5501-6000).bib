Abstract = {{Prairie pothole lakes (PPLs) are critical hydrological and ecological
   components of central North America and represent one of the largest
   inland wetland systems on Earth. These lakes are located within an
   agricultural region, and many of them are subject to nonpoint-source
   pesticide pollution. Limited attention, however, has been paid to
   understanding the impact of PPL water chemistry on the fate and
   persistence of pesticides. In this study, the abiotic reductive
   transformation of seven dinitroaniline pesticides was investigated in
   PPL sediment porewaters containing naturally abundant levels of reduced
   sulfur species (i.e., bisulfide (HS-) and polysulfides (S-n(2-))) and
   dissolved organic matter (DOM). Target dinitroanilines underwent rapid
   degradation in PPL porewaters and were transformed into corresponding
   amine products. While the largest fraction of the transformation could
   be attributed to reduced sulfur species, experimental evidence suggested
   that other reactive entities in PPL porewaters, such as DOM and mineral
   phases, might also affect the reaction rates of dinitroanilines. Results
   from this study highlight the importance of reductive transformation as
   an abiotic natural attenuation pathway for pesticides entering the PPL
   sedimentary environment.}},

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3415-3423}},

Abstract = {{We model intraurban intake fraction (iF) values for distributed
   ground-level emissions in all 3646 global cities with more than 100 000
   inhabitants, encompassing a total population of 2.0 billion. For
   conserved primary pollutants, population-weighted median, mean, and
   interquartile range iF values are 26, 39, and 14-52 ppm, respectively,
   where 1 ppm signifies 1 g inhaled/t emitted. The global mean urban iF
   reported here is roughly twice as large as previous estimates for cities
   in the United States and Europe. Intake fractions vary among cities
   owing to differences in population size, population density, and
   meteorology. Sorting by size, population-weighted mean iF values are 65,
   35, and 15 ppm, respectively, for cities with populations larger than 3,
   0.6-3, and 0.1-0.6 million. The 20 worldwide megacities (each >10
   million people) have a population-weighted mean iF of 83 ppm. Mean
   intraurban iF values are greatest in Asia and lowest in land-rich
   high-income regions. Country-average iF values vary by a factor of 3
   among the 10 nations with the largest urban populations.}},

Title = {{Variable data rate (VDR) network congestion control (NCC) applied to

Abstract = {{This paper presents three novel methods for implementing variable data
   rate (VDR) network congestion control (NCC), and compares them with
   traditional random (RND) drop methods. The proposed methods include:
   frequency (FRQ), combined random-innerloop frequency-outerloop (CRFRQ),
   and combined frequency-innerloop random-outerloop (CFRND). A generic
   model is used for RND drop that approximates congestion avoidance
   methods that drop packets. These methods allow NCC at intermediate
   network nodes using novel methods for setting data priority values. This
   is a first step towards demonstrating the need for stronger and
   efficient router technology to enhance Quality of Service (QoS) for
   voice applications. In the examples considered in this paper, the FRQ
   method reduced outage from 60\% with RND to 0\% with FRQ with 5 incoming
   flows through a bandwidth limited threshold of 1000 bits. Mean Opinion
   Score (MOS) was increased by a factor in the range from 0.2 to 1 on the
   MOS scale when using FRQ and CRFRQ over RND in the tested scenarios.
   CFRND performs in a similar manner to RND except it allows packet
   shrinking to increase network utilization. Network utilization increased
   by up to 37.5\% over the RND method compared with the novel methods in
   one example where all possible outcomes for RND were analyzed.
   Computational complexity with the novel methods can yield a speedup from
   0.02 ms faster for 1 flow to 0.56 ms faster for 10 flows over
   traditional lossy compression methods that rely on FFT operations. which
   are commonly found in lossy voice coders such as Speex. MELPe, and
   others. Finally, live real-time transport protocol (RTP) congestion
   tests were performed which confirmed the simulation results that the
   network congestion control methods achieve higher MOS scores and better
   QoS. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Development of a carbon clad core-shell silica for high speed
   two-dimensional liquid chromatography}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1229}},
Pages = {{129-139}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{We recently introduced a new method {[}1] to deposit carbon on fully
   porous silicas (5 mu m) to address some of the shortcomings of carbon
   clad zirconia (C/ZrO2), which has rather low retention due to its low
   surface area (20-30 m(2)/g). The method enables the introduction of a
   thin, homogeneous layer of Al(III) on silica to serve as catalytic sites
   for carbon deposition without damaging the silica's native pore
   structure. Subsequent carbon deposition by chemical vapor deposition
   resulted in chromatographically useful carbon phases as shown by good
   efficiencies and higher retentivity relative to C/ZrO2. Herein, we use
   the above method to develop a novel carbon phase on superficially porous
   silica (2.7 mu m). This small, new form of silica offers better mass
   transfer properties and higher efficiency with lower column back
   pressures as compared to sub 2 mu m silica packings, which should make
   it attractive for use as the second dimension in fast two-dimensional LC
   (LC x LC). After carbon deposition, several studies were conducted to
   compare the new packing with C/ZrO2. Consistent with work on 5 mu m
   fully porous silica, the metal cladding did not cause pore blockage.
   Subsequent carbon deposition maintained the good mass transfer
   properties as shown by the effect of velocity on HETP. The new packing
   exhibits efficiencies up to 5.6-fold higher than C/ZrO2 for polar
   compounds. We observed similar chromatographic selectivity for all
   carbon phases tested. Consequently, the use of the new packing as the
   second dimension in fast LC x LC improved the peak capacity of fast LC x
   LC. The new material gave loading capacities similar to C/ZrO2, which is
   rather as expected based on the surface areas of the two phases. (C)

Number = {{5, SI}},
Pages = {{842-849}},

Abstract = {{The stiffness, anisotropy, and heterogeneity of freshly dissected
   (control) and perfusion-decellularized rat right ventricles were
   compared using an anisotropic inverse mechanics method. Cruciform tissue
   samples were speckled and then tested under a series of different
   biaxial loading configurations with simultaneous force measurement on
   all four arms and displacement mapping via image correlation. Based on
   the displacement and force data, the sample was segmented into piecewise
   homogeneous partitions. Tissue stiffness and anisotropy were
   characterized for each partition using a large-deformation extension of
   the general linear elastic model. The perfusion-decellularized tissue
   had significantly higher stiffness than the control, suggesting that the
   cellular contribution to stiffness, at least under the conditions used,
   was relatively small. Neither anisotropy nor heterogeneity (measured by
   the partition standard deviation of the modulus and anisotropy) varied
   significantly between control and decellularized samples. We thus
   conclude that although decellularization produces quantitative
   differences in modulus, decellularized tissue can provide a useful model
   of the native tissue extracellular matrix. Further, the
   large-deformation inverse method presented herein can be used to
   characterize complex soft tissue behaviors. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Targeting drugs selectively to cancer cells can potentially benefit
   cancer patients by avoiding side effects generally associated with
   several cancer therapies. One of the attractive approaches to direct the
   drug cargo to specific sites is to incorporate ligands at the surface of
   the delivery systems. Integrin alpha(5)beta(1) is overexpressed in tumor
   vasculature and cancer cells, thus making it an attractive target for
   use in drug delivery. Our group has developed a fibronectin-mimetic
   peptide, PR\_b, which has been shown to bind specifically to integrin
   alpha(5)beta(1), thereby providing a tool to target
   alpha(5)beta(1)-expressing cancer cells in vitro as well as in vivo. Our
   current work focuses on designing modified stealth liposomes (liposomes
   functionalized with polyethylene glycol, PEG) for combining the benefits
   associated with PEGylation, as well as imparting specific targeting
   properties to the liposomes. We have designed PEGylated liposomes that
   incorporate in their bilayer the fibronectin-mimetic peptide-amphiphile
   PR\_b that can target several cancer cells that overexpress
   alpha(5)beta(1), including the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells used in
   this study. We have encapsulated doxorubicin inside the liposomes to
   enhance its therapeutic potential via PEGylation as well as active
   targeting to the cancer cells. Our results show that
   PR\_b-functionalized stealth liposomes were able to specifically bind to
   MDA-MB-231 cells, and the binding could be controlled by varying the
   peptide concentration. The intracellular trafficking of the doxorubicin
   liposomes was examined, and within minutes after delivery the majority
   of them were found to be in the early endosomes, whereas after a longer
   period of time they had accumulated in the late endosomes and lysosomes.
   The functionalized liposomes were found to be equally cytotoxic as the
   free doxorubicin, especially at higher doxorubicin concentrations, and
   provided higher cytotoxicity than the nontargeted and
   GRGDSP-functionalized stealth liposomes. Thus, the PR\_b-functionalized
   PEGylated nanoparticles examined in this study offer a promising
   strategy to deliver their therapeutic payload directly to the breast
   cancer cells, in an efficient and specific manner.}},

   2-ketoacid decarboxylases and screening for promiscuous aldehyde
   dehydrogenases, synthetic pathways were constructed to produce both C5
   and C6 acids. In particular, the production of isovaleric acid reached
   32 g/L (0.22 g/g glucose yield), which is 58\% of the theoretical yield.
   Furthermore, we have developed solid base catalysts to efficiently
   ketonize the bio-derived carboxylic acids such as isovaleric acid and
   isocaproic acid into high volume industrial ketones: methyl isobutyl
   ketone (MIBK, yield 84\%), diisobutyl ketone ( DIBK, yield 66\%) and
   methyl isoamyl ketone ( MIAK, yield 81\%). This hybrid ``Bio-Catalytic
   conversion'' approach provides a general strategy to manufacture
   aliphatic ketones, and represents an alternate route to expanding the
   repertoire of renewable chemicals.}},

Title = {{Executive Control Over Cognition: Stronger and Earlier Rule-Based

Abstract = {{Human cognition is characterized by flexibility, the ability to select
   not only which action but which cognitive process to engage to best
   achieve the current behavioral objective. The ability to tailor
   information processing in the brain to rules, goals, or context is
   typically referred to as executive control, and although there is
   consensus that prefrontal cortex is importantly involved, at present we
   have an incomplete understanding of how computational flexibility is
   implemented at the level of prefrontal neurons and networks. To better
   understand the neural mechanisms of computational flexibility, we
   simultaneously recorded the electrical activity of groups of single
   neurons within prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex of monkeys
   performing a task that required executive control of spatial cognitive
   processing. In this task, monkeys applied different spatial
   categorization rules to reassign the same set of visual stimuli to
   alternative categories on a trial-by-trial basis. We found that single
   neurons were activated to represent spatially defined categories in a
   manner that was rule dependent, providing a physiological signature of a
   cognitive process that was implemented under executive control. We found
   also that neural signals coding rule-dependent categories were
   distributed between the parietal and prefrontal cortex-however, not
   equally. Rule-dependent category signals were stronger, more powerfully
   modulated by the rule, and earlier to emerge in prefrontal cortex
   relative to parietal cortex. This suggests that prefrontal cortex may
   initiate the switch in neural representation at a network level that is
   important for computational flexibility.}},

Abstract = {{The precast concrete inverted-tee system was adopted by the Minnesota
   Department of Transportation after the 2004 FHWA/AASHTO International
   Scan Tour of bridge rapid construction techniques in Europe and Japan.
   As of 2005, two bridges were built in Minnesota adapting the
   Poutre-Dalle system developed in France. One of the two bridges, the
   Center City Bridge (MN bridge 13004), has been monitored for transverse
   load distribution and continuity over the pier since the deck was cast
   in September 2005. In addition, a two-span specimen was constructed to
   investigate different parameters, such as flange thickness, bursting
   reinforcement, horizontal shear reinforcement, and flange surface
   treatment. One of the four precast concrete sections of the laboratory
   specimen was identical to those used for MN bridge 13004. Part of the
   investigation was conducted to optimize section design through a
   parametric study. In addition, preliminary linear elastic finite element
   analyses were conducted to simulate the behavior of the system. The
   finite element models were calibrated using results obtained from static
   tests of MN bridge 13004 and the laboratory specimen. This paper
   presents a series of considerations obtained from a preliminary
   parametric study on different span lengths and bridge configurations. It
   also discusses some matters that had to be resolved to obtain acceptable
   agreement between experimental results and analytical approach. For all
   of the cases investigated, the service stresses were found to control
   the design.}},

   with pulsed laser ablation, and this technique is not limited by the
   type of materials or crystal structures. This article focuses on 1D
   nanostructures and presents an overview of the common growth mechanism
   of nanowires by pulsed laser ablation. We first introduce a general
   scheme of the pulsed laser ablation in a tube furnace for the nanowire
   growth. Subsequently, we discuss various growth mechanisms involved to
   generate 1D nanostructures from pulsed laser ablation, including
   vapor-liquid-solid growth, oxide-assisted growth, and vapor solid
   growth. Defects can also play an important role and they have been
   observed in the nanowires from different growth process.}},

Journal = {{CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{14-31}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Over the past few decades, single molecule investigations employing
   optical tweezers, AFM and TIRF microscopy have revealed that molecular
   behaviors are typically characterized by discrete steps or events that
   follow changes in protein conformation. These events, that manifest as
   steps or jumps, are short-lived transitions between otherwise more
   stable molecular states. A major limiting factor in determining the size
   and timing of the steps is the noise introduced by the measurement
   system. To address this impediment to the analysis of single molecule
   behaviors, step detection algorithms incorporate large records of data
   and provide objective analysis. However, existing algorithms are mostly
   based on heuristics that are not reliable and lack objectivity. Most of
   these step detection methods require the user to supply parameters that
   inform the search for steps. They work well, only when the signal to
   noise ratio (SNR) is high and stepping speed is low. In this report, we
   have developed a novel step detection method that performs an objective
   analysis on the data without input parameters, and based only on the
   noise statistics. The noise levels and characteristics can be estimated
   from the data providing reliable results for much smaller SNR and higher
   stepping speeds. An iterative learning process drives the optimization
   of step-size distributions for data that has unimodal step-size
   distribution, and produces extremely low false positive outcomes and
   high accuracy in finding true steps. Our novel methodology, also
   uniquely incorporates compensation for the smoothing affects of probe
   dynamics. A mechanical measurement probe typically takes a finite time
   to respond to step changes, and when steps occur faster than the probe
   response time, the sharp step transitions are smoothed out and can
   obscure the step events. To address probe dynamics we accept a model for
   the dynamic behavior of the probe and invert it to reveal the steps. No
   other existing method addresses the impact of probe dynamics on step
   detection. Importantly, we have also developed a comprehensive set of
   tools to evaluate various existing step detection techniques. quantify
   the performance and limitations of various step detection methods using
   novel evaluation scales. We show that under these scales, our method
   provides much better overall performance. The method is validated on
   different simulated test cases, as well as experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Swine finishing facility ventilation has become relatively complex and
   is often mismanaged as a system. One of the few ways to truly understand
   these systems is to spend time systematically going through the many
   components of the building and how they work as a system. To learn to
   help producers better, a team of university Extension specialists that
   included agricultural engineers and animal scientists spent an extended
   period carefully documenting conditions in a deep-pit swine finishing
   building with two 1,000-head rooms. Exhaust fans connected to the manure
   pit and wall fans were operated at various stages as a negative-pressure
   ventilation system. A computerized controller activated exhaust fans, a
   ventilation curtain actuator, heaters, stir fans, and a spray cooling
   system. Gravity-controlled baffled ceiling inlets were evenly spaced in
   the building to provide good air distribution during cold and mild
   weather conditions. Following the review of current conditions and
   operating parameters, performance deficiencies were identified and
   recommendations were given regarding controller settings, inlet
   settings, and the transition to natural ventilation. Specific
   recommendations included changing minimum ventilation speed settings of
   fans based on animal size, removing inlet stops during warmer weather to
   avoid premature transition to natural ventilation, a change in how fans
   were staged, a change in setpoint, and the specific temperature at which
   the cooling system was engaged.}},

Abstract = {{In practice, it has been observed that the method of pervious concrete
   void maintenance depends on which machines or vehicles the owners have
   available. This research compares the abilities of three common
   municipal utility vehicles-a vacuum truck with a flexible, 200-mm
   (8-in.) hose; a vacuum street sweeper; and a regenerative air street
   sweeper-to remove clogging material from the voids of in-service
   pervious concrete pavements. By using optical microscopy, it was found
   that clogging materials rarely migrate into voids deeper than 12.7 mm
   (1/2 in.) from the surface. Furthermore, all three machines were able to
   remove clogging materials that were located within 3.18 mm (1/8 in.) of
   the surface. The clogging material that was located deeper than 3.18 mm
   (1/8 in.) remained within the voids but was likely disturbed by either
   the suction or the forced air of the maintenance vehicles. DOI:

Abstract = {{We present experimental results for the collision of a single ?-DNA
   molecule with isolated cylindrical nanoposts whose radii range from 350
   nm to 1.37 mu m. The experimental apparatus was fabricated in oxidized
   silicon using a plasma-thinning method. The probability density for the
   dimensionless holdup time is described by a gamma distribution, which
   accurately represents the behavior of the probability density for X
   collisions and U/J collisions for short-lived and long-lived collisions,
   respectively. The shape parameter of the gamma distribution reflects the
   nature of the short-lived collisions, whereas the scaling parameter
   captures the role of the finite size of the post on the U/J collisions.
   When rendered in an appropriate dimensionless form, the existing models
   for the role of electric field gradients extend to all post sizes,
   indicating that 350 nm is still well above the point-sized limit. Our
   experiments provide insights into a regime that is very challenging for
   numerical simulations but highly relevant for separation processes.}},

Title = {{A Modular Machine Learning System for Flow-Level Traffic Classification
   in Large Networks}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY FROM DATA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The ability to accurately and scalably classify network traffic is of
   critical importance to a wide range of management tasks of large
   networks, such as tier-1 ISP networks and global enterprise networks.
   Guided by the practical constraints and requirements of traffic
   classification in large networks, in this article, we explore the design
   of an accurate and scalable machine learning based flow-level traffic
   classification system, which is trained on a dataset of flow-level data
   that has been annotated with application protocol labels by a
   packet-level classifier. Our system employs a lightweight modular
   architecture, which combines a series of simple linear binary
   classifiers, each of which can be efficiently implemented and trained on
   vast amounts of flow data in parallel, and embraces three key innovative
   mechanisms, weighted threshold sampling, logistic calibration, and
   intelligent data partitioning, to achieve scalability while attaining
   high accuracy. Evaluations using real traffic data from multiple
   locations in a large ISP show that our system accurately reproduces the
   labels of the packet level classifier when runs on (unlabeled) flow
   records, while meeting the scalability and stability requirements of
   large ISP networks. Using training and test datasets that are two months
   apart and collected from two different locations, the flow error rates
   are only 3\% for TCP flows and 0.4\% for UDP flows. We further show that
   such error rates can be reduced by combining the information of spatial
   distributions of flows, or collective traffic statistics, during
   classification. We propose a novel two-step model, which seamlessly
   integrates these collective traffic statistics into the existing traffic
   classification system. Experimental results display performance
   improvement on all traffic classes and an overall error rate reduction
   by 15\%. In addition to a high accuracy, at runtime, our implementation
   easily scales to classify traffic on 10Gbps links.}},

Abstract = {{Microwave pyrolysis of Douglas fir sawdust pellet was investigated to
   determine the effects of reaction temperature and time on the yields of
   bio-oil, syngas, and charcoal using a central composite design (CCD) and
   response surface analysis. The research results indicated that
   thermo-chemical conversion reactions can take place rapidly in
   large-sized biomass pellet by using microwave pyrolysis. The yields of
   bio-oil and syngas were increased with the reaction temperature and
   time. The highest yield of bio-oils was 57.8\% (dry biomass basis)
   obtained at 471 degrees C and 15 min. GC/MS analysis indicated that the
   bio-oils were mainly composed of phenols, guaiacols, furans,
   ketones/aldehydes, and organic acids. The yield of specific chemicals
   such as furans and phenolic compounds were highly related to the
   reaction temperature. The syngas contained high value chemicals, such as
   carbon monoxide, methane, and short chain hydrocarbons. A third-order
   reaction mechanism fits well the microwave pyrolysis of Douglas fir
   pellet with activation energy of 33.5 kJ/mol and a frequency factor of
   3.03 s(-1). (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The correct forecasting of unrecorded data could be enormously helpful
   in designing water projects and preventing related damages. The
   conventional methods available for rainfall estimation usually take a
   long time to estimate the missing data, and their estimations may have
   many errors in the long-term simulations. In this study, the
   capabilities of different Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were
   analyzed in estimating missing data from the Ardabel plain rain gauge
   stations located in northwestern Iran. Accordingly, six different
   structures of ANNs were used, and their efficiencies in terms of the
   mean squared error, training, and validation determination coefficients
   to select better-estimated missing data were examined. The results
   revealed that the best model is composed of the feed-forward networks,
   trained by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm and considering only one
   hidden layer. For each of the stations with a complete data set, an ANN
   was trained. Data gaps from other stations were obtained by the proposed
   ANN models. Furthermore, an integrated ANN was developed to investigate
   the hidden spatial relationships among the rainfall data of the stations
   as well as temporal auto-correlations. The results indicated the
   superiority of the proposed integrated model. After the estimation of
   the rain data gaps, the K-means clustering method was also employed as a
   data pre-processing method to improve the accuracy of the estimation,
   and the method led to better results.}},

Title = {{The Posterior Location of the Dilator Muscle Induces Anterior Iris

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To examine the effect of the posterior location of the dilator
   on iris anterior curvature during dilation.
   METHODS. An in vivo human study, an ex vivo porcine experiment, and an
   in silico computational model were performed in parallel. Iris anterior
   curvature was measured in vivo before and after dilation by time-domain
   slit lamp optical coherence tomography (SL-OCT). All patients (n = 7)
   had undergone laser peripheral iridotomy to eliminate any pupillary
   block due to primary angle-closure glaucoma. In the ex vivo experiments,
   isolated porcine irides (n = 30) were secured at the periphery and
   immersed in an oxygenated Krebs-Ringer buffer. Dilation was induced
   pharmaceutically by the addition of 2.5\% phenylephrine and 1\%
   tropicamide. An in-house optical coherence tomography (OCT) system was
   used to obtain iris images before and after dilation. A finite element
   model was also developed based on typical geometry of the iris from the
   initial OCT image. The iris was modeled as a neo-Hookean solid, and the
   active muscle component was applied only to the region specified as the
   dilator.
   RESULTS. An increase in curvature and a decrease in chord length after
   dilation were observed in both experiments. In both the in vivo and ex
   vivo experiments, the curvature-tochord length ratio increased
   significantly during dilation. Computer simulations agreed well with the
   experimental results only when the proper anatomic position of dilator
   was used.
   CONCLUSIONS. The posterior location of the dilator contributes to the
   anterior iris bowing via a nonpupillary block dependent mechanism.

Abstract = {{When precast full-depth deck panels and/or decked bulb-Ts (DBTs) are
   used for accelerated bridge construction, transverse joints exist. In
   this study, continuous transverse U-bar joint details, which can provide
   negative moment continuity in multispan bridges, have been investigated.
   Four full-scale specimens connected by the developed U-bar detail
   together with the selected closure-pour (CP) materials, overnight cure
   and seven-day cure, were tested. Static and fatigue tests under tension
   loading were conducted. The loading demand necessary in the testing was
   determined based on the maximum forces in the transverse joint from an
   analytical study. Test results were evaluated based on tension capacity,
   cracking, and steel strain. Based on these test results, the developed
   transverse U-bar joint detail is a promising connection system. DOI:

Abstract = {{Continuous longitudinal U-bar joint details for accelerated bridge
   construction are investigated. Four pairs of full-scale slabs connected
   by a U-bar detail with one of the selected closure-pour materials were
   tested under static and fatigue loadings. The loading demand necessary
   in the slab fatigue testing is determined on the basis of 3D
   finite-element (FE) parametric studies. Test results were evaluated on
   the basis of flexural capacity, curvature behavior, cracking, and steel
   strain. The fatigue loading was found to have little influence on the
   U-bar joint behavior. In general, crack widths were small at the service
   load level. No debonding between the slab and the joint was noticed. The
   joint moment capacity can be calculated on the basis of the assumption
   that U-bars were continuous reinforcement through the joint zone (i.e.,
   not staggered as in actual specimens) reaching their yield strengths at
   ultimate. The actual moment capacity depends on the interaction between
   the closure-pour material and steel as well as the steel arrangement.
   Because the closure-pour material is cast-in-place and has a relative
   short curing time for the purpose of accelerated construction, it is
   very important to control its strength variation. On the basis of these
   tests, the U-bar joint detail is a viable connection system for the
   longitudinal joint in bridge decks. DOI:

Abstract = {{The phase behaviors of crystalline solids embedded within nanoporous
   matrices have been studied for decades. Classic nucleation theory
   conjectures that phase stability is determined by the balance between an
   unfavorable surface free energy and a stabilizing volume free energy.
   The size constraint imposed by nanometer-scale pores during
   crystallization results in large ratios of surface area to volume, which
   are reflected in crystal properties. For example, melting points and
   enthalpies of fusion of nanoscale crystals can differ drastically from
   their bulk scale counterparts. Moreover, confinement within nanoscale
   pores can dramatically influence crystallization pathways and crystal
   polymorphism, particularly when the pore dimensions are comparable to
   the critical size of; an emerging nucleus. At this tipping point, the
   surface and volume free energies are in delicate balance and polymorph
   stability rankings may differ from bulk. Recent investigations have
   demonstrated that confined crystallization can be used to screen for and
   control polymorphism. In the food, pharmaceutical, explosive, and dye
   technological sectors, this understanding and control over polymorphism
   is critical both for function and for regulatory compliance.
   This Account reviews recent studies of the polymorphic and thermotropic
   properties of crystalline materials embedded in the nanometer-scale
   pores of porous glass powders and porous block-polymer-derived plastic
   monoliths. The embedded nanocrystals exhibit an array of phase
   behaviors, including the selective formation of metastable amorphous and
   crystalline phases, thermodynamic stabilization of normally metastable
   phases, size-dependent polymorphism, formation of new polymorphs, and
   shifts of thermotropic relationships between polymorphs. Size
   confinement also permits the measurement of thermotropic properties that
   cannot be measured in bulk materials using conventional methods.
   Well-aligned cylindrical pores of the polymer monoliths also allow
   determination and manipulation of nanocrystal orientation. In these
   systems, the constraints imposed by the pore walls result In a
   competition between crystal nuclei that favors those with the fastest
   growth direction aligned with the pore axis.
   Collectively, the examples described in this Account provide substantial
   insight into crystallization at a size scale that Is difficult to
   realize by other means. Moreover, the behaviors resulting from
   nanoscopic confinement are remarkably consistent for a wide range of
   compounds, suggesting a reliable approach to studying the phase
   behaviors of compounds at the nanoscale. Newly emerging classes of
   porous materials promise expanded explorations of crystal growth under
   confinement and new routes to controlling crystallization outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an approximation for the probability of optically resolving
   two fluorescent labels on the backbone of a DNA molecule confined in a
   nanochannel in the Odijk regime as a function of the fluorescence
   wavelength, channel size, and the properties of the DNA (persistence
   length and effective width). The theoretical predictions agree well with
   equivalent data produced by Monte Carlo simulations of a touching
   wormlike bead model of DNA in a high ionic strength buffer. Although the
   theory is only strictly valid in the limit where the effective width of
   the nanochannel is small compared with the persistence length of the
   DNA, simulations indicate that the theoretical predictions are
   reasonably accurate for channel widths up to two-thirds of the
   persistence length. Our results quantify the conjecture that DNA
   barcoding has kilobase pair resolution-provided the nanochannel lies in
   the Odijk regime. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{This paper reports the temperature dependent cross-plane thermal
   conductivity of pure silica zeolite (PSZ) MFI and MEL thin films
   measured using the 3 omega method between 30 and 315 K. PSZ MFI thin
   films were b-oriented, fully crystalline, and had a 33\% microporosity.
   PSZ MEL thin films consisted of MEL nanoparticles embedded in a
   nonuniform and porous silica matrix. They featured porosity, relative
   crystallinity, and particle size ranging from 40\% to 59\%, 23\% to
   47\%, and 55 to 80 nm, respectively. Despite their crystallinity, MFI
   films had smaller thermal conductivity than that of amorphous silica due
   to strong phonon scattering by micropores. In addition, the effects of
   increased relative crystallinity and particle size on thermal
   conductivity of MEL thin films were compensated by the simultaneous
   increase in porosity. Finally, thermal conductivity of MFI zeolite was
   predicted and discussed using the Callaway model based on the Debye

Abstract = {{Ultrasonic tomography is an emerging method of nondestructive concrete
   pavement diagnostics which can be used for improved quality

   address these limitations, a quantitative method for determining the
   presence of defects in concrete pavements was developed. The proposed
   method is an adaptation of the recently developed impact-echo signature
   analysis method (IESA), which is used for comparison of impact-echo
   signals. The proposed two-dimensional ultrasonic tomography signature
   analysis (2D-UTSA) method was used to compare two-dimensional B-scans
   obtained using a commercial test system in field trials at the Minnesota

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the phase and amplitude instability mechanisms
   of midinfrared quantum-cascade lasers with Fabry-Perot cavity. The phase
   instability exhibits the single-mode nature and the amplitude
   instability is the multimode Risken-Nummedal-Graham-Haken kind of
   instability. The stability analysis is performed based on the nonlinear
   Maxwell-Bloch formulism. The phase instability and amplitude instability
   are decoupled based on the symmetry and antisymmetry of propagating
   modes in the cavity. We also discuss the influences of Kerr nonlinearity
   from optical transitions on these instability mechanisms. The Kerr
   nonlinearity exhibits as the combination of saturable absorber effect in
   the transverse direction and the self-phase modulation (SPM) in the
   longitudinal direction. The saturable absorber could lower the threshold
   of both instability mechanisms. The SPM has an impact on the instability
   spectra of quantum-cascade lasers. It could not only broaden the
   unstable frequency domain, but also transform it from the single-mode to
   the multimode domain.}},

Abstract = {{Fedbatch culture is the prevalent cell cultivation method in producing
   protein therapeutics. A metabolic shift to lactate consumption in late
   stage of cultivation has been shown to extend the culture viability and
   increase product concentrations. To better understand the factors, which
   trigger metabolic shift we performed transcriptome and metabolic flux
   analysis on a fedbatch culture of mouse myeloma cell line (NS0) and
   developed a mechanistic kinetic model for energy metabolism.
   Experimental observation indicates that the shift to lactate consumption
   occurs upon the cessation of rapid growth and under conditions of low
   glycolysis flux and high extracellular lactate concentrations. Although
   the transition is accompanied by a general down regulation of enzymes in
   energy metabolism, that alone was insufficient to elicit a metabolic
   shift. High lactate level has been reported to exert an inhibitory
   effect on glycolysis enzyme phosphofructokinase; model simulation
   suggests that a high lactate level can contribute to reduced glycolytic
   flux as well as providing a driving force for its conversion to
   pyruvate. The transcriptome data indicate that moderate alteration in
   the transcript levels of AKT1 and P53 signaling pathways genes occurs in
   the late stage of culture. These signaling pathways are known to
   regulate glycolytic activity. Model simulations further suggest that
   AKT1 signaling plays a key role in facilitating lactate consumption.
   Collectively, our results strongly suggest that lactate consumption in
   fedbatch culture is an outcome of reduced glycolysis flux, which is a
   product of lactate inhibition and regulatory action of signaling pathway
   caused by reduced growth rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Extending a recent work (Pang et al., in press) pertaining to a simple
   single-bottleneck model, this paper is the first of a two-part research
   wherein we undertake a mathematically rigorous study of the
   continuous-time dynamic user equilibrium (DUE) problem using the
   recently introduced mathematical paradigm of differential
   complementarity systems (DCSs) (Pang and Stewart, 2008). The first step
   in this comprehensive research is to gain a thorough understanding of
   some continuous-time point-queue models, which will be used as the
   building block of a computationally tractable model for the
   continuous-time DUE problem that we will study in detail in the
   accompanying paper (Ban et al., in press). Starting with the original
   point-queue model introduced by Vickrey (1969), we summarize some
   desirable properties that a continuous-time point-queue model should
   possess, and show that one of these properties-the nonnegativity of the
   queue lengths-is violated by Vickrey's original model. As a remedy to
   this drawback of Vickrey's model and with the goal of extending it to a
   continuous-time setting, we introduce two continuous-time point-queue
   models and show that they satisfy the properties we propose.
   Discretizations of the continuous-time models are discussed and
   construction of numerical trajectories is presented; convergence of such
   trajectories as the time step approaches zero is established; regularity
   of a solution to the continuous-time problem is clarified, and numerical
   results are presented. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is the second of a two-part research wherein we undertake a

   user equilibrium (DUE) problem using the recently introduced

   Based on the thorough study of continuous-time single-destination
   point-queue models in the previous part, we first extend this special
   case to multiple destinations respecting the First-In-First-Out property
   of travel flows. A DCS with constant time delay is then introduced to
   formulate the continuous-time model of instantaneous dynamic traffic
   equilibria (IDUE) with a fixed demand profile. We develop a time
   decomposition scheme based on link free flow travel times to convert the
   delay DCS to a series of DCSs without time delays that are solved by a
   numerical time-stepping method. We provide rigorous numerical treatment
   of the time-decomposed IDUE model, including solvability of the
   discrete-time complementarity problems and convergence of the numerical
   trajectories to a continuous-time solution. We present numerical results
   to validate the IDUE on a small network and also on the Sioux Falls

Abstract = {{APOBEC3G is a single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminase that Comprises part
   of the innate immune response to viruses and transposons. Although
   APOBEC3G is the prototype for understanding the larger mammalian
   polynucleotide deaminase family, no specific chemical inhibitors exist
   to modulate its activity. High-throughput screening identified 34
   compounds that inhibit APOBEC3G catalytic activity. Twenty of 34 small
   molecules contained catechol moieties, which are known to be sulfhydryl
   reactive following oxidation to the orthoquinone. Located proximal to
   the active site, C321 was identified as the binding site for the
   inhibitors by a combination of mutational screening, structural
   analysis, and mass spectrometry. Bulkier substitutions C321-to-L, F, Y,
   or W mimicked chemical inhibition. A strong specificity for APOBEC3G was
   evident, as most compounds failed to inhibit the related APOBEC3A enzyme
   or the unrelated enzymes E. coli uracil DNA glycosylase, HIV-1 RNase H,
   or HIV-1 integrase. Partial, but not complete, sensitivity could be
   conferred to APOBEC3A by introducing the entire C321 loop from APOBEC3G.
   Thus, a structural model is presented in Which the mechanism is both
   specific and competitive, by binding a pocket adjacent to the APOBEC3G
   active site, reacting With C321 and blocking, access to substrate DNA
   cytosines.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a new interpretation of intuitionistic fuzzy sets in the
   advanced framework of the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is extended
   to monitor safety-critical systems' performance. Not only is the
   proposed approach more effective, but it also takes into account the
   fuzzy rules that deal with imperfect knowledge/information and,
   therefore, is different from the classical Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy system,
   which assumes that the rule (the knowledge) is perfect. We provide an
   analytical solution to the practical and important problem of the
   conceptual probabilistic approach for formal ship safety assessment
   using the fuzzy set theory that involves uncertainties associated with
   the reliability input data. Thus, the overall safety of the ship engine
   is investigated as an object of risk analysis using the fuzzy mapping
   structure, which considers uncertainty and partial truth in the
   input-output mapping. The proposed method integrates direct evidence of

   of the polymer flow. Various millimeter-scale polymer structures with

Abstract = {{Large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the compression of silicon
   nanospheres were performed with the Stillinger-Weber potential. Several
   defects were observed to cause the yielding, including dislocations,
   stacking faults and phase transformations. To better investigate
   dislocation interactions, spheres of increasing size comprised of up to
   one million atoms were simulated. The morphologies of the defects and
   the conditions under which they are formed are explored. A new and
   interesting route to dislocation formation is identified and examined in
   which perfect dislocations form on \{1 1 0\} planes as opposed to the
   expected \{1 1 1\} planes. The dislocations on \{1 1 0\} planes are
   observed to form through a pathway with an intermediate metastable state
   corresponding to a change in the atomic bonding. Density Functional
   based Tight Binding calculations reveal the feasibility of this pathway
   although the appearance of dislocations on the \{1 1 0\} plane in the
   molecular dynamics simulations is specific to the Stillinger-Weber
   potential. \{C\} 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescence studies of cellular protein-protein interactions commonly
   employ transient cotransfection to express two proteins carrying
   distinct fluorescent labels. Because transiently transfected cells
   differ significantly in their expression level, the concentration ratio
   of the two expressed proteins varies, which in turn influences the
   measured fluorescence signal. Knowledge of the statistics of protein
   expression ratios is of considerable interest both from a fundamental
   point of view and for cellular fluorescence studies. Despite the
   perceived randomness of transient transfection, we were able to develop
   a quantitative model that describes the average and distribution of the
   protein expression ratio from a cell population. We show that the
   expression ratio is proportional to the molar plasmid ratio and relate
   the distribution to the finite number of active plasmids in the cell.
   The process of cationic lipid-mediated transfection is explored in more
   detail. Specifically, the influence of lipoplexes on the statistics of
   the expression ratio is examined. We further demonstrate that the
   transfection model provides a quantitative description of fluorescence
   fluctuation experiments, where only a fraction of the proteins are
   labeled.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of Maxwell's equivalent inhomogeneity is re-evaluated in the
   context of the effective elastic properties of unidirectional
   multi-phase composite materials with the fibers of circular
   cross-section. The following key questions are addressed in this paper.
   Is the concept of equivalent inhomogeneity valid only for the materials
   with low volume fractions, as originally suggested by Maxwell? When do
   the interactions among the fibers matter? Could Maxwell's concept be
   generalized to allow for accurate estimates of the effective properties?
   The approach advocated in the paper provides an unique opportunity to
   study, in the framework of one model, the effects of the interactions
   among fibers on the effective transversely isotropic elastic properties

Title = {{First passage calculation of the conductivity of particle

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{218}},
Pages = {{31-39}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{There is considerable interest in transport via conduction through
   particle laden suspensions (e.g. nanofluids) and composite materials.
   Frequently, such multiphase systems display enhanced conductivities
   beyond what is expected from the effective medium approximation. While
   the origin of this enhancement is often a source of controversy, the
   most common explanation for anomalous conductivity enhancements is the
   aggregation of particles. In this work, we employ a first passage
   simulation technique to investigate the influence of particle
   aggregation on the resulting conductivity of particle-laden suspensions
   and composites. Aggregates are modeled as quasifractal objects, and a
   sequential algorithm is used to computationally generate aggregates of
   prescribed fractal dimension, pre-exponential factor, number of primary
   particles, and degree of overlap (coalescence) between primary
   particles. Four model types of aggregates (highly linear structures with
   little coalescence, highly linear structures with substantial
   coalescence, dense structures with little coalescence, and dense
   structures with substantial coalescence) are examined via the first
   passage technique, enabling determination of the conductivity of a
   suspension/composite containing aggregates at a known volume fraction.
   It is found that for a given type of aggregate, the number of primary
   particles per aggregate has little-to-no influence on
   suspension/composite conductivity under any circumstances. For low
   conductivity particles (particle conductivity/host material conductivity
   = 10), aggregate formation and aggregate morphology have little
   influence on suspension/composite conductivity, except at particle
   volume fractions >0.10 where slight enhancements beyond the effective
   medium approximation are observable. However, for high conductivity
   aggregates (particle conductivity/host matrix conductivity = 100), the
   influence of aggregation is substantial, and all morphological
   descriptors of the aggregate influence suspension/composite
   conductivity. In this instance, the resulting enhancement in
   conductivity can be equivalent to the enhancement expected if well
   dispersed spherical particles were incorporated into the
   suspension/composite at a volume fraction 3-5 times higher than the
   actual aggregate volume fraction. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Solving the Kohn-Sham equation, which arises in density functional
   theory, is a standard procedure to determine the electronic structure of
   atoms, molecules, and condensed matter systems. The solution of this
   nonlinear eigenproblem is used to predict the spatial and energetic
   distribution of electronic states. However, obtaining a solution for
   large systems is computationally intensive because the problem scales
   super-linearly with the number of atoms. Here we demonstrate a divide
   and conquer method that partitions the necessary eigenvalue spectrum
   into slices and computes each partial spectrum on an independent group
   of processors in parallel. We focus on the elements of the spectrum
   slicing method that are essential to its correctness and robustness such
   as the choice of filter polynomial, the stopping criterion for a vector
   iteration, and the detection of duplicate eigenpairs computed in
   adjacent spectral slices. Some of the more prominent aspects of
   developing an optimized implementation are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

   Esterel allows arbitrary combinations and nesting of these operators,

Title = {{Coulomb-influenced collisions in aerosols and dusty plasmas}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{2, 2}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{In aerosol and dusty plasma systems, the behavior of suspended particles
   (grains) is often strongly influenced by collisions occurring between
   ions and particles, as well as between particles themselves. In
   determining the collision kernel or collision rate coefficient for such
   charged entities, complications arise in that the collision process can
   be completely described neither by continuum transport mechanics nor by
   free molecular (ballistic) mechanics; that is, collisions are transition
   regime processes. Further, both the thermal energy and the potential
   energy between colliding entities can strongly influence the collision
   rate and must be considered. Flux-matching theory, originally developed
   by Fuchs, is frequently applied for calculation of collision rate
   coefficients under these circumstances. However, recent work suggests
   that crucial assumptions in flux-matching theory are not appropriate to
   describe transition regime collisions in the presence of potential
   interactions. Here, we combine dimensional analysis and mean first
   passage time calculations to infer the collision kernel between dilute
   charged entities suspended in a light background gas at thermal
   equilibrium. The motion of colliding entities is described by a Langevin
   equation, and Coulombic interactions are considered. It is found that
   the dimensionless collision kernel for these conditions, H, is a
   function of the diffusive Knudsen number, Kn(D) (in contrast to the
   traditional Knudsen number), and the potential energy to thermal energy
   ratio, Psi(E). For small and large Kn(D), it is found that the
   dimensionless collision kernels inferred from mean first passage time
   calculations collapse to the appropriate continuum and free molecular
   limiting forms, respectively. Further, for repulsive collisions (Psi(E)
   negative) or attractive collisions with Psi(E) < 0.5, calculated results
   are in excellent agreement with flux-matching theory predictions, and
   the dimensionless collision kernel can be determined conveniently via
   use of the H(Kn(D)) relationship found for hard-sphere collisions with
   modified definitions of H and Kn(D) to account for potential energy.
   However, for Psi(E) > 0.5, it is found that flux-matching theory
   predictions substantially underestimate the collision kernel. We find
   that the collision process in this regime is governed by the minimum of
   Kn(D) and Kn(Psi) (Kn(Psi) = 3Kn(D)/2 Psi(E)), and based on
   calculations, propose a function H(Kn(D), Kn(Psi)) for collision kernel
   evaluation. The situations for which Psi(E) > 0.5 apply to singly
   charged nanoparticles and multiply charged submicrometer and
   supermicrometer particles, and are thus prevalent in both aerosol and
   dusty plasma environments.}},

Abstract = {{An approximate two-dimensional model for indentation of blunt objects
   into various types of rigid-perfectly plastic cohesive-frictional
   material is derived. Particular emphasis is placed on considering
   indentation as a process involving evolution of the boundary of material
   displaced by the indenter. Forcepenetration relationships are obtained
   by an incremental approach utilizing key kinematic and static
   information from indentation of a flat punch. Albeit approximate, the
   proposed model applies to arbitrary indenter geometry and weightless or
   ponderable cohesive-frictional materials exhibiting associated or
   non-associated plastic flow. Two specific indenter geometries, the
   cylinder and blunt wedge, are explored in detail. Favorable agreement is
   found between the analytic results and those obtained using the finite
   element method (FEM). For both the wedge and cylinder, it is further
   shown that accurate analytic expressions relating indentation force
   explicitly to penetration can be derived. In the case of the wedge and
   weightless material, predictions of indentation force obtained from the
   derived expressions are very close to those computed from implicit
   equations available in the literature. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{We investigated a model of acute respiratory distress syndrome in which
   the serum protein albumin adsorbs to an air-liquid interface and
   prevents the thermodynamically preferable adsorption of the clinical
   lung surfactant Survanta by inducing steric and electrostatic energy
   barriers analogous to those that prevent colloidal aggregation. Chitosan
   and polyethylene glycol (PEG), two polymers that traditionally have been
   used to aggregate colloids, both allow Survanta to quantitatively
   displace albumin from the interface, but through two distinct
   mechanisms. Direct visualization with confocal microscopy shows that the
   polycation chitosan coadsorbs to interfacial layers of both Survanta and
   albumin, and also colocalizes with the anionic domains of Survanta at
   the air-liquid interface, consistent with it eliminating the
   electrostatic repulsion by neutralizing the surface charges on albumin
   and Survanta. In contrast, the PEG distribution does not change during
   the displacement of albumin by Survanta, consistent with PEG inducing a
   depletion attraction sufficient to overcome the repulsive energy barrier
   toward adsorption.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate an affordable low-noise surface plasmon resonance (SPR)
   instrument based on extraordinary optical transmission (EOT) in metallic
   nanohole arrays and quantify a broad range of antibody-ligand binding
   kinetics with equilibrium dissociation constants ranging from 200 pM to
   40 nM. This nanohole-based SPR instrument is straightforward to
   construct, align, and operate, since it is built around a standard
   microscope and a portable fiber-optic spectrometer. The measured
   refractive index resolution of this platform is 3.1 x 10(-6) without
   on-chip cooling, which is among the lowest reported for SPR sensors
   based on EOT. This is accomplished via rapid full-spectrum acquisition
   in 10 ms followed by frame averaging of the EOT spectra, which is made
   possible by the production of template-stripped gold nanohole arrays
   with homogeneous optical properties over centimeter-sized areas.
   Sequential SPR measurements are performed using a 12-channel
   microfluidic flow cell after optimizing surface modification protocols
   and antibody injection conditions to minimize mass-transport artifacts.
   The immobilization of a model ligand, the protective antigen of anthrax
   on the gold surface, is monitored in real-time with a signal-to-noise
   ratio of similar to 860. Subsequently, real-time binding kinetic curves
   were measured quantitatively between the antigen and a panel of small,
   25 kDa single-chain antibodies at concentrations down to 1 nM. These
   results indicate that nanohole-based SPR instruments have potential for
   quantitative antibody screening and as a general-purpose platform for
   integrating SPR sensors with other bioanalytical tools.}},

Abstract = {{E-bikes in China are the single largest adoption of alternative fuel
   vehicles in history, with more than 100 million e-bikes purchased in the
   past decade and vehicle ownership about 2X larger for e-bikes as for
   conventional cars; e-car sales, too, are rapidly growing. We compare
   emissions (CO2, PM2.5, NOx, HC) and environmental health impacts
   (primary PM2.5) from the use of conventional vehicles (CVs) and electric
   vehicles (EVs) in 34 major cities in China. CO2 emissions (g km(-1))
   vary and are an order of magnitude greater for e-cars (135-274) and CVs
   (150-180) than for e-bikes (14-27). PM2.5 emission factors generally are
   lower for CVs (gasoline or diesel) than comparable EVs. However, intake
   fraction is often greater for CVs than for EVs because combustion
   emissions are generally closer to population centers for CVs (tailpipe
   emissions) than for EVs (power plant emissions). For most cities, the
   net result is that primary PM2.5 environmental health impacts per
   passenger-km are greater for e-cars than for gasoline cars (3.6x on
   average), lower than for diesel cars (2.5X on average), and equal to
   diesel buses. In contrast, e-bikes yield lower environmental health
   impacts per passenger-km than the three CVs investigated: gasoline cars
   (2x), diesel cars (10X), and diesel buses (5x). Our findings highlight
   the importance of considering exposures, and especially the proximity of
   emissions to people, when evaluating environmental health impacts for
   EVs.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafine particulate matter (UFP; diameter <0.1 mu m) concentrations
   are relatively high on the freeway, and time spent on freeways can
   contribute a significant fraction of total daily UFP exposure. We model
   real-time size-resolved UFP concentrations in summer time on-freeway
   air. Particle concentrations (32 bins, 5.5 to 600 nm) were measured on
   Minnesota freeways during summer 2006 and 2007 (Johnson, J. P.;
   Kittelson, D. B.; Watts, W. F. Environ. Sci. Technol. 2009, 43,
   5358-5364). Here, we develop and apply two-way stratified multilinear
   regressions, using an approach analogous to mobile-monitoring land-use
   regression but using real-time meteorological and traffic data. Our
   models offer the strongest predictions in the 10-100 nm size range
   (adj-R-2: 0.79-0.89, average adj-R-2: 0.85) and acceptable but weaker
   predictions in the 130-200 nm range (adj-R-2: 0.41-0.62, average
   adj-R-2: 0.52). The aggregate model for total particle counts performs
   well (adj-R-2 = 0.77), Bootstrap resampling (n = 1000) indicates that
   the proposed models are robust to minor perturbations in input data. The
   proposed models are based on readily available real-time information
   (traffic and meteorological parameters) and can thus be exploited to
   offer spatiotemporally resolved prediction of UFPs on freeways within
   similar geographic and meteorological environments. The approach
   developed here provides an important step toward modeling population
   exposure to UFP.}},

   efficiency obtained from photoluminescence quenching measurements, eta
   CC is calculated without any input from optical field simulations. For
   bulk heterojunction OPVs based on the donor-acceptor pairing of boron
   subphthalocyanine chloride and C-60, a peak eta CC of (79 +/- 2)\% is
   realized for films containing 80 wt. \% C-60 under short-circuit
   conditions. This optimum composition also coincides with a peak in the

Abstract = {{We compare the dielectric functions of silver interfaces obtained via
   thermal evaporation with those obtained with template stripping.
   Ellipsometry measurements show that the smoother template-stripped
   surfaces exhibit effective dielectric functions with a more negative
   real component and a smaller imaginary component, implying higher
   conductivity and less energy loss, respectively. These results agree
   with the relation between dielectric function and surface roughness
   derived from combining the effective-medium model and the Drude-Lorentz
   model. The improvement in the effective dielectric properties shows that
   metallic films prepared via template stripping can be favorable for
   applications in electronics, nanophotonics, and plasmonics. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The integrity of the genome depends on diverse pathways that regulate
   DNA metabolism. Defects in these pathways result in genome instability,
   a hallmark of cancer. Deletion of ELG1 in budding yeast, when combined
   with hypomorphic alleles of PCNA results in spontaneous DNA damage
   during S phase that elicits upregulation of ribonucleotide reductase
   (RNR) activity. Increased RNR activity leads to a dramatic expansion of
   deoxyribonucleotide (dNTP) pools in G1 that allows cells to synthesize
   significant fractions of the genome in the presence of hydroxyurea in
   the subsequent S phase. Consistent with the recognized correlation
   between dNTP levels and spontaneous mutation, compromising ELG1 and PCNA
   results in a significant increase in mutation rates. Deletion of
   distinct genome stability genes RAD54, RAD55, and TSA1 also results in
   increased dNTP levels and mutagenesis, suggesting that this is a general
   phenomenon. Together, our data point to a vicious circle in which
   mutations in gatekeeper genes give rise to genomic instability during S
   phase, inducing expansion of the dNTP pool, which in turn results in
   high levels of spontaneous mutagenesis. The EMBO Journal (2012) 31,

Abstract = {{Modern non-invasive brain imaging technologies, such as diffusion
   weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI), enable the mapping of neural
   fiber tracts in the white matter, providing a basis to reconstruct a
   detailed map of brain structural connectivity networks. Brain
   connectivity networks differ from random networks in their topology,
   which can be measured using small worldness, modularity, and high-degree
   nodes (hubs). Still, little is known about how individual differences in
   structural brain network properties relate to age, sex, or genetic
   differences. Recently, some groups have reported brain network
   biomarkers that enable differentiation among individuals, pairs of
   individuals, and groups of individuals. In addition to studying new
   topological features, here we provide a unifying general method to
   investigate topological brain networks and connectivity differences
   between individuals, pairs of individuals, and groups of individuals at
   several levels of the data hierarchy, while appropriately controlling
   false discovery rate (FOR) errors. We apply our new method to a large
   dataset of high quality brain connectivity networks obtained from High
   Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) tractography in 303 young
   adult twins, siblings, and unrelated people. Our proposed approach can
   accurately classify brain connectivity networks based on sex (93\%
   accuracy) and kinship (88.5\% accuracy). We find statistically
   significant differences associated with sex and kinship both in the
   brain connectivity networks and in derived topological metrics, such as
   the clustering coefficient and the communicability matrix. (C) 2011

Title = {{Validation of a Miniature Thermochron for Monitoring Thoracolumbosacral
   Orthosis Wear Time}},
Journal = {{SPINE}},

Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{309-315}},

Abstract = {{Study Design. Prospective validation study.
   Objective. To establish the accuracy of miniature thermochrons for
   estimating thoracolumbosacral orthosis (TLSO) wear time in patients with
   adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
   Summary of Background Data. There has been an emphasis in recent years
   on measuring wear time as opposed to using subjective methods such as
   relying on the patient or parent estimation. By measuring the amount of
   time that was spent in the orthosis, uncertainty is reduced and the
   validity of the research is improved. Several types of devices have been
   employed for direct monitoring of orthosis wear time including strap
   tension monitors, pressure sensors, and temperature-time sensors
   (thermochrons). Direct monitoring studies have shown that relying on
   patient or parent report is inaccurate; the patient/parent report is
   clearly biased towards overestimation of wear time.
   Methods. Three miniature thermochrons (DS1922L iButton, Maxim Integrated
   Products, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA) were mounted underneath padding in the
   TLSOs of 7 participants diagnosed with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis.
   The participants wore their TLSO for 1 month. During this time,
   participants kept meticulous records of wear time in diaries. An
   algorithm was developed to automatically detect donning/doffing of the
   orthosis, and the results of the data reduction algorithm were compared
   with the diary (gold standard).
   Results. Total wear time accuracy was 98.5\% (0.37 hours/day), while the
   precise timing of donning/doffing was 92\% accurate.
   Conclusion. An inexpensive, commercially available miniature thermochron
   and a simple robust algorithm can estimate TLSO wear time to a high
   degree of accuracy. This method is suitable for large-scale prospective
   studies examining the efficacy of bracing in adolescent idiopathic
   scoliosis, which remains a topic of controversy.}},

Abstract = {{Amberlite XAD resins have been employed to a great extent as the sorbent
   for removing or concentrating organic compounds from different matrices.
   We present for the first time a systematic study on the sorption of
   perfluorochemical (PFC) surfactants, an emerging class of environmental
   contaminants, by XAD-7HP (moderately polar) and XAD-2 (nonpolar). The
   results show that XAD-7HP can strongly sorb PFCs at circumneutral pH;
   the isotherm-determined linear sorption coefficient can reach 10(6)
   L/kg. On the other hand, the sorption coefficient for XAD-2 was two
   orders of magnitude lower than that for XAD-7HP. PFC sorption on XAD-7HP
   increased with an increase of the perfluorocarbon chain length of PFC
   and a decrease of the solution pH, indicating the importance of
   hydrophobic and electrostatic effects. The sorption coefficient for
   XAD-7HP reduced markedly with increasing fraction of the organic
   cosolvent (methanol) in the water-cosolvent mixture: however, the trend
   could not be predicted by a log-linear cosolvency model. Furthermore,
   the statistical analysis of column test results showed that after
   regeneration XAD-7HP can be used at least eight times without
   significant loss of performance. Finally, the experimental results imply
   that XAD-7HP sorption of shorter-chained PFCs (<= 5 perfluorinated
   carbons) from water can be thermodynamically favorable. (C) 2011

   nanowires but at the junction area between the nanowires and the

Abstract = {{The potential use of Cu- and Ag-exchanged Y zeolites as selective
   adsorbents for hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from Claus process tail gas was
   investigated with density functional theory (DFT). The adsorption
   energies of H2S and other Claus tail gas components (CO, H2O, N-2, and
   CO2) were computed for these zeolites as well as for Li-Y, Na-Y, and K-Y
   on a cluster model. Comparison of adsorption energies for H2S versus the
   other components indicated that Ag-Y has potential for selective
   adsorption of H2S, whereas Cu-Y is subject to strong adsorption of CO,
   and alkali metal-exchanged Y zeolites are subject to H2O adsorption.
   Comparison with alkali metal-exchanged Y zeolites was performed to
   clarify the role of d electrons, while the influence of the zeolite
   framework was assessed by comparing adsorption energies on the cluster
   model with those on bare cations. Absolutely localized molecular orbital
   energy decomposition analysis (ALMO EDA) revealed that for Cu- and
   Ag-containing systems, transfer of electrons between the cation and the
   adsorbate, i.e., the donation of d electrons and the acceptance of
   electrons in the unoccupied orbitals of the cation, plays an important
   role in determining the adsorption energy. On the other hand, for alkali
   metals-containing systems, charge transfer is negligible and adsorption
   energies are dominated by interactions due to electrostatics,
   polarization, and structural distortions.}},

Abstract = {{Self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) have been employed for years on
   plasmonic nanostructured substrates to facilitate surface-enhanced Raman
   detection of nontraditional molecules. To date, no experiments have been
   conducted to study the monolayer formation or crystallinity on
   traditional roughened silver film over nanosphere (AgFON) substrates or
   to clarify what fundamental properties make a partition layer effective.
   The work presented herein utilizes surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy
   (SERS) band analysis and localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)
   monitoring to examine formation of alkanethiol self-assembled monolayers
   on AgFONs, with SERS band analysis yielding structural information and
   LSPR spectral shifts yielding insight about the SAM formation and
   thickness. Herein, two short chain monolayers and two long chain
   monolayers were employed to look for SAM thickness and ordering effects
   over a 72 h time period and under potential control. Overall, the
   results demonstrate that both the distance a molecule is held from the
   AgFON surface and the monolayer crystallinity influence which SAM will
   be an effective partition layer. Also, the ability to tailor monolayer
   thickness and crystallinity via potential packing has significant
   advantages over traditional open circuit monolayer formation.}},

Abstract = {{Using a combination of X-ray scattering, fluorescence correlation
   spectroscopy, coarse-grained molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
   potential of mean force calculations, we have explored the membrane
   remodeling effects of monomeric alpha-synuclein (alpha S). Our initial
   findings from multiple approaches are that alpha S (1) causes a
   significant thinning of the bilayer and (2) stabilizes positive mean
   curvature, such that the maximum principle curvature matches that of
   synaptic vesicles, alpha S-induced tubules, and the synthetic lipid
   vesicles to which the protein binds most tightly. This suggests that
   alpha S binding to synaptic vesicles likely stabilizes their intrinsic
   curvature. We then show that alpha S induces local negative Gaussian
   curvature, an effect that occurs in regions of alpha S shown previously
   via NMR and corroborated by MD simulation to have significant
   conformational flexibility. The induction of negative Gaussian
   curvature, which has implications for all curvature-sensing and
   curvature-generating amphipathic alpha-helices, supports a hypothesis
   that connects helix insertion to fusion and fission of vesicles,
   processes that have recently been linked to alpha S function. Then, in
   an effort to explain these biophysical properties of alpha S, we promote
   an intrinsic curvature-field model that recasts long-range protein
   protein interactions in terms of the interactions between the local
   curvature fields generated by lipid protein complexes.}},

Abstract = {{The electrical and structural behavior of uniformly mixed films of boron
   subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and C60 and their performance in
   organic photovoltaic cells is explored. Device performance shows a
   strong dependence on active-layer donoracceptor composition, and peak
   efficiency is realized at 80 wt.\% C60. The origin of this C60-rich
   optimum composition is elucidated in terms of morphological changes in
   the active layer upon diluting SubPc with C60. While neat SubPc is found
   to be amorphous, mixed films containing 80 wt.\% C60 show clear
   nanocrystalline domains of SubPc. Supporting electrical characterization
   indicates that this change in morphology coincides with an increase in
   the hole mobility of the SubPc:C60 mixture, with peak mobility observed
   at a composition of 80 wt.\% C60. Organic photovoltaic cells constructed
   using this optimum SubPc:C60 ratio realize a power conversion efficiency
   of (3.7 +/- 0.1)\% under 100 mW cm-2 simulated AM1.5G solar

Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2812-2816}},

Abstract = {{The quantification of biofilm mechanical properties can serve as a basis
   for understanding biofilm resilience and for developing biofilm control
   strategies. One aspect of tensile testing that is likely to be important
   for a viscoelastic material such as bacterial biofilm, but unfortunately
   is often overlooked (i.e., not controlled or reported), is the strain
   rate used during testing. Thus, we performed tensile testing on intact
   S. epidermidis biofilms using the microcantilever method at 12 strain
   rate values ranging over approximately 3 orders of magnitude (0.013-9.07
   s(-1)). Ultimate or cohesive strength, elastic modulus, and toughness
   increased with increasing strain rate and approached a plateau at
   approximately 1.3 s(-1). Failure strain, on the other hand, did not
   exhibit any trend with strain rate. Given that the mean values of some
   parameters increased by as much as 1 order of magnitude over the strain
   rate range used in this work, we suggest that the strain rate during
   tensile testing should be carefully controlled and reported to
   facilitate comparisons among different studies. Furthermore, the
   quantitative expressions developed in this work that relate mechanical
   property values with strain rate may be useful for modeling the
   deformation of bacterial biofilms under applied loads.}},

Abstract = {{Humic acids (HAs) accept and donate electrons in many biogeochemical
   redox reactions at oxic/anoxic interfaces. The products of oxidation of
   reduced HAs by O-2 are unknown but are expected to yield reactive oxygen
   species, potentially including hydroxyl radical (center dot OH). To
   quantify the formation of center dot OH upon oxidation of reduced HAs by
   O-2, three HAs were reduced electrochemically to well-defined redox
   states and were subsequently oxidized by O-2 in the presence of the
   center dot OH probe terephthalate. The formation of center dot OH upon
   oxidation increased with increasing extent of HA reduction. The yield of
   center dot OH ranged from 42 to 160 mmol per mole of electrons donated
   by the reduced HA. The intermediacy of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in the
   formation of center dot OH was supported by enhancement of center dot OH
   formation upon addition of exogenous H2O2 sources and by the suppression
   of center dot OH formation upon addition of catalase as a quencher of
   endogenous H2O2. The formation of center dot OH in the dark during
   oxidation of reduced HA represents a previously unknown source of center
   dot OH formation at oxic/anoxic interfaces and may affect the
   biogeochemical and pollutant redox dynamics at these interfaces.}},

   are observed when comparing the C-30, C-18, C-8 systems and the
   retention mechanism of nonpolar alkane solutes shows contribution from
   both partitioning and adsorption on all three of these stationary
   phases. Unlike in the other systems, the mobile phase solvent is highly
   structured at its interface with the C-1 and bare silica phases, the
   former being enriched in methanol and the latter in water. Alkane
   solutes are unretained at the bare silica surface while alcohol solutes
   are only slightly enriched at the silica surface due to hydrogen bonding
   with surface silanols and surface bound solvent. With regard to solute
   size, it appears that the retention mechanism is not affected by the
   chain length of the solute. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{With advancing age, injury, musculoskeletal pathology or a combination
   of these, a degenerative cascade of biomechanical, biochemical, and
   nutritional alterations diminish the intervertebral discs' ability to
   maintain its structure and function. While the biomechanics of isolated
   disc tissues has been investigated across this degenerative spectrum,
   none have attempted to retain the in situ disc-endplate morphology
   during compressive tissue characterization. The objective of this study
   was to spatially quantify the viscoelastic parameters of the
   intervertebral disc throughout degeneration, including the as yet
   unreported residual stress/strain. This required the development of a
   hybrid confined/in situ indentation methodology, which preserves the
   disc structural morphology. At four locations of the disc (anterior-AF,
   right and left lateral AF, and NP) stress-relaxation tests were
   performed using the hybrid confined/in situ indentation method, which
   utilizes the vertebral endplate as the porous indenter tip. This method
   allows the endplate to remain interwoven with the disc tissue, retaining
   its native orientation. Healthy disc tissue exhibited significantly
   higher residual stress values compared to both moderate and severe
   degeneration in all locations (p < 0.0156). Furthermore, the equilibrium
   stress at 15\% strain (stress relaxation) was significantly diminished
   with advancing disc degeneration (p < 0.0241). The equilibrium
   viscoelastic parameters show healthy discs encounter higher forces at
   the same strain level, and are able to maintain this force, where
   degenerated discs are unable to maintain this force throughout time.
   This morphology-conserved method provides insight into the spatial
   compressive mechanical properties of the intervertebral disc across the
   degeneration spectrum and will aid in modeling these tissue changes. (C)

Abstract = {{We report the hole transport properties of semi-conducting polymers in
   contact with ionic liquids as a function of electrochemical potential
   and charge carrier density. The conductivities of four different polymer
   semiconductors including the benchmark material poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) were controlled by electrochemical gating (doping) in a
   transistor geometry. Use of ionic liquid electrolites in these
   experiments allows high carrier densities of order 10(21) cm(-3) to be
   obtained in the polymer semiconductors and also facilitates variable
   temperature transport measurements. Importantly, all four polymers
   displayed a nonmonotonic dependence of the conductivity on carrier
   concentration. For example, for P3HT in contact with the ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate
   ({[}EMI]{[}FAP]), the hole conductivity reached a maximum of 85 S/cm at
   6 x 10(20) holes cm(-3) or 0.16 holes per thiophene ring. Further
   increases in charge density up to 035 holes per ring produced a
   reversible drop in film conductivity. The reversible decrease in
   conductivity is due to a carrier density dependent hole mobility, which
   reaches 0.80 +/- 0.08 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) near the conductivity peak. The
   conductivity behavior was qualitatively independent of the type of ionic
   liquid in contact with the polymer semiconductor though there were
   quantitative differences in the current versus gate voltage
   characteristics. Temperature dependent measurements of the mobility in
   P3HT revealed that it is activated over the range 250-350 K. Both the
   pre-exponential coefficient mu(0) and the activation energy E-A depend
   nonmonotonically on carrier density with E-A becoming as small as 20 meV
   at the conductivity peak. Overall, the peak in conductivity versus
   carrier density appears to be a general result for polymer
   semiconductors gated with ionic liquids.}},

Abstract = {{Although atomic layer deposition (ALD) has been used for many years as

   modify metallic surfaces to tune their optical and plasmonic properties,
   to protect them against unwanted oxidation and contamination, or to
   create biocompatible surfaces. Furthermore, ALD is unique among thin
   film deposition techniques in its ability to meet the processing demands
   for engineering nanoplasmonic devices, offering conformal deposition of
   dense and ultrathin films on high-aspect-ratio nanostructures at
   temperatures below 100 degrees C. In this review, we present key
   features of ALD and describe how it could benefit future applications in

Abstract = {{Thin native oxide layers can dominate the mechanical properties of
   metallic thin films. However, to date there has been little
   quantification of how such overlayers affect yield and fracture during
   indentation in constrained film systems. To gain insight into such
   processes, electrical contact resistance was measured in situ during
   nanoindentation on constrained thin films of epitaxial Cr and
   polycrystalline Al, both possessing a native oxide overlayer.
   Measurements during loading of the films show both increases and
   decreases in current, which can then be used to distinguish between
   various sources of plasticity. Ex situ measurements of the oxide
   thickness are used to provide a starting point for elasticity
   simulations of stress in both systems. The results show that dislocation
   nucleation in the metal film can be differentiated from oxide fracture
   during indentation.}},

Abstract = {{Engineering structures such as aircraft, bridges, dams, nuclear
   containments and ships, as well as computer circuits, chips and MEMS,
   should be designed for failure probability < 10(-6)-10(-7) per lifetime.
   The safety factors required to ensure it are still determined
   empirically, even though they represent much larger and much more
   uncertain corrections to deterministic calculations than do the typical
   errors of modern computer analysis of structures. The empirical approach
   is sufficient for perfectly brittle and perfectly ductile structures
   since the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of random strength is
   known, making it possible to extrapolate to the tail from the mean and
   variance. However, the empirical approach does not apply to structures
   consisting of quasibrittle materials, which are brittle materials with
   inhomogeneities that are not negligible compared to structure size. This
   paper presents a refined theory on the strength distribution of
   quasibrittle structures, which is based on the fracture mechanics of
   nanocracks propagating by activation energy controlled small jumps
   through the atomic lattice and an analytical model for the multi-scale
   transition of strength statistics. Based on the power law for creep
   crack growth rate and the cdf of material strength, the lifetime
   distribution of quasibrittle structures under constant load is derived.
   Both the strength and lifetime cdf's are shown to be size- and
   geometry-dependent. The theory predicts intricate size effects on both
   the mean structural strength and lifetime, the latter being much
   stronger. The theory is shown to match the experimentally observed
   systematic deviations of strength and lifetime histograms of industrial
   ceramics from the Weibull distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Effective thermal integration could enable the use of compact fuel
   processors with PEM fuel cell-based power systems. These systems have
   potential for deployment in distributed, stationary electricity
   generation using natural gas. This paper describes a concept wherein the
   latent heat of vaporization of H2O is used to control the axial
   temperature gradient of a fuel processor consisting of an autothermal
   reformer (ATR) with water gas shift (WGS) and preferential oxidation
   (PROX) reactors to manage the CO exhaust concentration. A prototype was
   experimentally evaluated using methane fuel over a range of external
   heat addition and thermal inputs. The experiments confirmed that the
   axial temperature profile of the fuel processor can be controlled by
   managing only the vapor fraction of the premixed reactant stream. The
   optimal temperature profile is shown to result in high thermal
   efficiency and a CO concentration less than 40 ppm at the exit of the
   PROX reactor. Copyright (C) 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{The underlying mechanisms responsible for the toughening of block.;
   copolymer modified thermoset epoxies are not completely understood. A
   current theory, targets cavitation of the rubbery cores in dispersed
   micelles as the key event that triggers shear yielding, resulting in
   enhanced toughness. To evaluate this hypothesis, we prepared spherical
   micelle forming block copolymers with rubbery cores (prone to
   cavitation) and glassy cores (unable to cavitate). Surprisingly, both
   systems enhance fracture toughness, although the rubbery core micelles
   outperform the glassy core counterparts. This finding challenges
   previous deductions regarding the toughening mechanism. We propose that
   the mechanical integrity of the region immediately surrounding the
   micelle core is compromised by the presence of the corona blocks,
   facilitating local deformation of the matrix. We speculate that the
   compliant nature of the rubber amplifies this effect.}},

Abstract = {{A stoichiometric model describing the central metabolism of Shewanella
   oneidensis MR-1 wild-type and derivative strains was developed and used
   in elementary mode analysis (EMA). Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 can
   anaerobically respire a diverse pool of electron acceptors, and may be
   applied in several biotechnology settings, including bioremediation of
   toxic metals, electricity generation in microbial fuel cells, and
   whole-cell biocatalysis. The metabolic model presented here was adapted
   and verified by comparing the growth phenotypes of 13 single- and 1
   double-knockout strains, while considering respiration via aerobic,
   anaerobic fumarate, and anaerobic metal reduction (Mtr) pathways, and
   utilizing acetate, n-acetylglucosamine (NAG), or lactate as carbon
   sources. The gene ppc, which encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
   (Ppc), was determined to be necessary for aerobic growth on NAG and
   lactate, while not essential for growth on acetate. This suggests that
   Ppc is the only active anaplerotic enzyme when cultivated on lactate and
   NAG. The application of regulatory and substrate limitations to EMA has
   enabled creation of metabolic models that better reflect biological
   conditions, and significantly reduce the solution space for each
   condition, facilitating rapid strain optimization. This wild-type model
   can be easily adapted to include utilization of different carbon sources
   or secretion of different metabolic products, and allows the prediction
   of single- and multiple-knockout strains that are expected to operate
   under defined conditions with increased efficiency when compared to wild
   type cells. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Gait efficiency in children with cerebral palsy is usually quantified by
   metabolic energy expenditure. Mechanical energy estimations, however,
   can be a valuable supplement as they can be assessed during gait
   analysis and plotted over the gait cycle, thus revealing information on
   timing and sources of increases in energy expenditure. Unfortunately,
   little information on validity and sensitivity exists.
   Three mechanical estimation approaches: (1) centre of mass (CoM)
   approach, (2) sum of segmental energies (SSE) approach and (3)
   integrated joint power approach, were validated against oxygen
   consumption and each other. Sensitivity was assessed in typical gait and
   in children with diplegia. CoM approach underestimated total energy
   expenditure and showed poor sensitivity. SSE approach overestimated
   energy expenditure and showed acceptable sensitivity. Validity and
   sensitivity were best in the integrated joint power approach. This
   method is therefore preferred for mechanical energy estimation in
   children with diplegia. However, mechanical energy should supplement,
   not replace metabolic energy, as total energy expended is not captured
   in any mechanical approach. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{44}},
Pages = {{24-45}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A method of particle characterization by measuring their mobility
   diameter, d(m), mass, m, and vacuum aerodynamic diameter, d(a)(vac) is
   proposed and tested for diesel- and flame soot agglomerates having
   mobility sizes 300-768 nm. The method involves no assumptions other than
   the knowledge of the particle inherent density. Experiments were
   performed to establish mass-mobility relationship. The agglomerates'
   mass-mobility exponent (D-fm) was found to be 2.31 and 1.98 for
   diesel-soot and flame-soot particles, respectively. The dynamic shape
   factors (DSFs) of the agglomerates in vacuum and at atmospheric pressure
   were deduced from the data measured in the range from 2 to 5 for
   diesel-soot and from 2.7 to 4.3 for flame-soot particles, respectively.
   The vacuum DSFs are significantly higher than those measured at
   atmospheric pressure.
   Independently, from the measured agglomerates' vacuum aerodynamic
   diameter d(a)(vac) and mass m we evaluated their vacuum mobility
   diameters, d(m)(vac), and the concomitant vacuum fractal dimension,
   D-pr, relating m and d(m)(vac): m = k(pr) (d(a)(vac)/d(p))(Dpr) and
   governing also the agglomerates' projected properties. Despite the clear
   difference in D-fm, determined from the mass-mobility relationship, both
   soot particles have close vacuum properties D-pr,D- k(pr), reflecting
   the screening effect by monomer primary particles, composing the
   agglomerates. A method is proposed to determine the average primary
   particle diameter d(p), from the measured agglomerates m - d(a)(vac)
   power dependence.
   The model of Vainshtein \& Shapiro (2005), for agglomerates' drag in
   rarefied gases, is used to rationalize and correlate the measured
   experimental results. We found that the agglomerates' DSFs are very
   sensitive with respect to their structure, as expressed in their fractal
   dimension (D-f). Therefore we proposed a method of retrieving the
   agglomerates' D-f from the DSFs measured in the transition regime, on
   the basis of an appropriate theoretical model for agglomerates' drag.

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{217}},
Pages = {{288-297}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this paper is to study the mechanism by which clumps of some
   powdered materials break up and disperse on a liquid surface to form a
   monolayer of particles. We show that a clump breaks up because when
   particles on its outer periphery come in contact with the liquid surface
   they are pulled into the interface by the vertical component of
   capillary force overcoming the cohesive forces which keep them attached,
   and then these particles move away from the clump. In some cases, the
   clump itself is broken into smaller pieces and then these smaller pieces
   break apart by the aforementioned mechanism. The newly-adsorbed
   particles move away from the clump, and each other, because when
   particles are adsorbed on a liquid surface they cause a flow on the
   interface away from themselves. This flow may also cause particles
   newly-exposed on the outer periphery of the clump to break away.
   Interestingly, when many particles asymmetrically break away from a
   clump, the clump itself is pushed in the opposite direction by the flow
   caused by the newly-adsorbed particles. Since millimeter-sized clumps
   can breakup and spread on a liquid surface within a few seconds, their
   behavior appears to be similar to that of some liquid drops which can
   spontaneously spread on solid surfaces. However, if the capillary force
   is not large enough to overcome the cohesive force holding the clump
   together, the clump may not breakup. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Pre-extraction of hemicelluloses before commercial pulping processes
   such as kraft pulping has been considered as one potential approach to
   generate fermentable sugars as feedstock for biofuels and bioproducts.
   In this study kraft white liquor with 18\% active alkali and 25\%
   sulfidity was used to partially extract xylan from commercial aspen
   chips. Reaction temperatures of 70-90 degrees C and reaction times of
   1-4 h were explored. Amount of xylan extracted increased with increasing
   time and temperature. The extracted xylan was recovered using
   ultrafiltration. We were able to recover xylan at levels of up to 48 g
   kg (1) of dry original chips. Pre-extracted chips were used for
   subsequent kraft pulping. The ultrafiltration permeate was utilized as
   cooking liquor without any additional processing and without additional
   chemical addition. Due to the pre-extraction the lignin removal in
   subsequent kraft processes was significantly faster; offering the option
   of reducing cooking time and increasing mill throughput. Pulp yield
   remained in the same range as the control. Physical properties of pulps
   made from pre-extracted aspen chips showed similar strength properties
   as the control runs if compared at given lignin content. Pre-extraction
   of aspen chips using existing kraft white liquor appears to be a viable
   approach in an attempt to produce a side stream of fermentable sugars in
   an existing pulp mill. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Model and experimental validation}},

Abstract = {{A model and experimental validation of shear buckling and local bearing
   failure of web core sandwich panels are presented. Of particular
   interest are steel-faced panels with stiffening metal webs and a polymer
   core. The metal webs provide the required panel stiffness and the foam
   core serves the dual purposes of preventing local buckling and providing
   thermal insulation. In applications, such as the building sector, in
   which thermal performance is crucial, the webs are thin and widely
   spaced to reduce conduction between the face sheets. The models of shear
   buckling and bearing failure account for the influence of the core
   material on web strength and provide closed-form solutions. The models
   are validated by symmetric four-point bending tests to evaluate shear
   buckling and asymmetric three-point bending for bearing failure. The
   shear buckling model predicted buckling strength to within 4\% of the
   test results. The bearing failure model overpredicted the observed
   strength by 11\% on average, similar to test results reported in the
   literature for the bearing strength of webs with no foam support. (C)

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{Provable lower bounds are presented for the information rate I(X; X + S
   + N) where X is the symbol drawn independently and uniformly from a
   finite-size alphabet, S is a discrete-valued random variable (RV) and N
   is a Gaussian RV. It is well known that with S representing the
   precursor intersymbol interference (ISI) at the decision feedback
   equalizer (DFE) output, I(X; X + S + N) serves as a tight lower bound
   for the symmetric information rate (SIR) as well as capacity of the ISI
   channel corrupted by Gaussian noise. When evaluated on a number of
   well-known finite-ISI channels, these new bounds provide a very similar
   level of tightness against the SIR to the conjectured lower bound by
   Shamai and Laroia at all signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges, while being
   actually tighter when viewed closed up at high SNRs. The new lower
   bounds are obtained in two steps: First, a ``mismatched{''} mutual
   information function is introduced which can be proved as a lower bound
   to I(X; X + S + N) Secondly, this function is further bounded from below
   by an expression that can be computed easily via a few
   single-dimensional integrations with a small computational load.}},

Abstract = {{Soybean hull, generated from soybean processing, is a lignocellulosic
   material with limited industrial applications and little market value.
   This research is exploring a new application of soybean hull to be
   converted to fungal lipids for biodiesel production through solid-state
   fermentation. Mortierella isabellina was selected as the oil producer
   because of its high lipid content at low C/N ratio. Several cultivation
   factors were investigated, including moisture content, inoculums size,
   fungal spore age, and nutrient supplements, in an attempt to enhance the
   lipid production of the solid-state fermentation process. The results
   showed that lipid production with the increase of the moisture content
   and the spore age, while decreased as the size of inoculums increased.
   Nutrients addition (KH2PO4 1.2 mg and MgSO4 0.6 mg/g soybean hull)
   improved the lipid production. The total final lipid reached 47.9 mg
   lipid from 1 g soybean hull after the conversion, 3.3-fold higher than
   initial lipid reserve in the soybean hull. The fatty acid profile
   analysis indicated that fatty acid content consisted of 30.0\% of total
   lipid, and 80.4\% of total fatty acid was C16 and C18. Therefore, lipid
   production from soybean hull is a possible option to enable soybean hull
   as a new resource for biodiesel production and to enhance the overall
   oil production from soybeans.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the brittleness transition in low-toughness materials, the
   nucleation and kinetics of dislocations must be measured and modeled.
   One aspect overlooked is that the apparent activation energy for
   plasticity is modified at very high stresses. Coupled with state of
   stress and length scale effects on plasticity, the lowering of the
   brittle-to-ductile transition (BDT) in such materials can be partially
   understood. Experimental evidence in silicon single crystals in the
   length scale regime of 40 nm to 1 mm is presented. It is shown that high
   stress affects both length scale and temperature-dependent properties of
   activation volume and activation energy for dislocation nucleation
   and/or mobility. Nanoparticles and nanopillars of single-crystal silicon
   demonstrate unexpectedly high fracture toughness at low temperatures
   under compression. A thermal activation approach can model the three
   decades of size associated with the factor of three absolute temperature
   shift in the BDT.}},

Abstract = {{Ternary blends of two homopolymers and a diblock copolymer can
   self-assemble into interpenetrating, three-dimensionally continuous
   networks with a characteristic length scale of similar to 100 nm. In
   this review, we summarize our recent work demonstrating that these
   equilibrium fluid phases, known as polymeric bicontinuous microemulsions
   (B mu E), can be designed as versatile precursors to nanoporous
   materials having pores with uniform sizes of similar to 100 nm. As a
   model system, nanoporous polyethylene (PE) is derived from B mu Es
   composed entirely of polyolefins. This monolithic material is then used
   as a template in the synthesis of other nanoporous materials for which
   structural control at the nm scale has traditionally been difficult to
   achieve. These materials, which include a high-temperature ceramic,
   polymeric thermosets and a conducting polymer, are produced by a simple
   nanocasting process, providing an inverse replica of the PE template.
   The PE is further used as a template for the production of
   hierarchically structured inorganic and polymeric materials by
   infiltration of mesostructured compounds into its pore network. The work
   described herein represents an unprecedented suite of nanoporous
   materials with well-defined pore structures prepared from a single PE
   template. They are anticipated to have potential application in diverse
   technological areas, including catalysis, separations and electronic
   devices. Polymer Journal (2012) 44, 131-146; doi:10.1038/pj.2011.136}},

   Physical Inactivity, Air Pollution, and Ischemic Heart Disease Mortality}},

Volume = {{120}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity and exposure to air pollution are
   important risk factors for death and disease globally. The built
   environment may influence exposures to these risk factors in different
   ways and thus differentially affect the health of urban populations.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated the built environment's association with air
   pollution and physical inactivity, and estimated attributable health
   risks.
   METHODS: We used a regional travel survey to estimate within-urban
   variability in physical inactivity and home-based air pollution exposure
   {[}particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <= 2.5 mu m (PM2.5),
   nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ozone (O-3)] for 30,007 individuals in
   southern California. We then estimated the resulting risk for ischemic
   heart disease (IHD) using literature-derived dose response values. Using
   a cross-sectional approach, we compared estimated IHD mortality risks
   among neighborhoods based on ``walkability{''} scores.
   RESULTS: The proportion of physically active individuals was higher in
   high- versus low-walkability neighborhoods (24.9\% vs. 12.5\%); however,
   only a small proportion of the population was physically active, and
   between-neighborhood variability in estimated IHD mortality attributable
   to physical inactivity was modest (7 fewer IHD deaths/100,000/year in
   high- vs. low-walkability neighborhoods). Between-neighborhood
   differences in estimated IHD mortality from air pollution were
   comparable in magnitude (9 more IHD deaths/100,000/year for PM2.5 and 3
   fewer IHD deaths for O-3 in high- vs. low-walkability neighborhoods),
   suggesting that population health benefits from increased physical
   activity in high-walkability neighborhoods may be offset by adverse
   effects of air pollution exposure.
   POLICY IMPLICATIONS: Currently, planning efforts mainly focus on
   increasing physical activity through neighborhood design. Our results
   suggest that differences in population health impacts among
   neighborhoods are similar in magnitude for air pollution and physical
   activity. Thus, physical activity and exposure to air pollution are
   critical aspects of planning for cleaner, health-promoting cities.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports on recent progress in the field of directed
   self-assembly, wherein discrete inorganic semiconductor device
   components are assembled on flexible substrates, and compares these
   results with prior work. The research aims to develop
   self-assembly-based chiplet assembly processes that can extend minimal
   die sizes and throughput beyond what is currently possible with robotic
   pick and place methods. This manuscript concentrates on self-assembly
   that is driven by the reduction of surface free energy between liquid
   solder-coated areas on a substrate and metal-coated contacts on
   semiconductor dies that act as binding sites. Scaling prior results to
   sub-100 micrometer-sized components has required a transition to a new
   self-assembly platform. Specifically, recent work has moved from a drum
   delivery concept to a new scheme that uses a stepwise reduction of
   interfacial free energy at a triple interface between oil, water, and a
   penetrating solder-patterned substrate to introduce components. Finally,
   this paper also discusses design rules to produce highly periodic
   ``self-tiled{''} domains on rigid, flexible, and curved substrates. We
   describe discrete, self-tiled, and microconcentrator-augmented solar
   cell modules as applications that are fault tolerant and reduce the
   amount of Si material used by up to a factor of 22 when compared to
   conventional cells. {[}2011-0143]}},

Abstract = {{Cell-free synthesis, a method for the rapid expression of proteins, is
   increasingly used to study interactions of complex biological systems.
   GFP and its variants have become indispensable for fluorescence studies
   in live cells and are equally attractive as reporters for cell-free
   systems. This work investigates the use of fluorescence fluctuation
   spectroscopy (FFS) as a tool for quantitative analysis of protein
   interactions in cell-free expression systems. We also explore
   chromophore maturation of fluorescent proteins, which is of crucial
   importance for fluorescence studies. A droplet sample protocol was
   developed that ensured sufficient oxygenation for chromophore maturation
   and ease of manipulation for titration studies. The kinetics of
   chromophore maturation of EGFP, EYFP, and mCherry were analyzed as a
   function of temperature. A strong increase in the rate from room
   temperature to 37 degrees C was observed. We further demonstrate that
   all EGFP proteins fully mature in the cell-free solution and that
   brightness is a robust parameter specifying stoichiometry. Finally, FFS
   is applied to study the stoichiometry of the nuclear transport factor 2
   in a cell-free system over a broad concentration range. We conclude that
   combining cell-free expression and FFS provides a powerful technique for
   quick, quantitative study of chromophore maturation and protein-protein
   interaction. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Circuit techniques for enhancing the retention time and random cycle of
   logic-compatible embedded DRAMs (eDRAMs) are presented. An asymmetric 2T
   gain cell utilizes the gate and junction leakages of a PMOS write device
   to maintain a high data `1' voltage level which enables fast read access
   using an NMOS read device. A current-mode sense amplifier (C-S/A)
   featuring a cross-coupled PMOS latch and pseudo-PMOS diode pairs is
   proposed to overcome the innate problem of small read bit-line (RBL)
   voltage swing in 2T eDRAMs with improved voltage headroom and better
   impedance matching under process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. A
   half-swing write bit-line (WBL) scheme is adopted to improve the WBL
   speed by 33\% and reduce its power dissipation by 25\% during write-back
   operation with no effect on retention time. A stepped write word-line
   (WWL) driver reduces the current drawn from the boosted high and low
   supplies by 67\%. A 192 kb eDRAM test chip with 512 cells-per-BL
   implemented in a 65 nm low-power (LP) CMOS process shows a random cycle
   frequency and latency of 667 MHz and 1.65 ns, respectively, at 1.1 V and
   85 C. The measured refresh period at a 99.9\% bit yield condition was
   110 mu s which is comparable to that of recently published 1T1C eDRAM
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{Consider a K-user flat fading MIMO interference channel where the kth
   transmitter (or receiver) is equipped with M-k (respectively N-k)
   antennas. If an exponential (in K) number of generic channel extensions
   are used either across time or frequency, Cadambe and Jafar {[}1] showed
   that the total achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) can be maximized via
   interference alignment, resulting in a total DoF that grows linearly
   with K even if M-k and N-k are bounded. In this work we consider the
   case where no channel extension is allowed, and establish a general
   condition that must be satisfied by any degrees of freedom tuple (d(1),
   d(2), ... d(K)) achievable through linear interference alignment. For a
   symmetric system with M-k = M, N-k = N, d(k) = d for all k, this
   condition implies that the total achievable DoF cannot grow linearly
   with K, and is in fact no more than K (M + N)/(K + 1). We also show that
   this bound is tight when the number of antennas at each transceiver is
   divisible by d, the number of data streams per user.}},

Abstract = {{An adaptive wall function is employed in Detached-Eddy Simulation (DES),
   a hybrid Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) - Large Eddy Simulation
   (LES) model, of turbulent flow past two wall-mounted cubic obstacles in
   tandem at a Reynolds number Re = 22,000 based on the bulk velocity and
   the obstacle height. Numerical results are compared with previously
   published DES solutions obtained on wall integration grids and the
   experimental measurements of Martinuzzi and Havel (2000). The result
   shows that wall-function approach in DES allows reasonable reproduction
   of coherent vortical structures massively separated from the
   wall-mounted obstacles to be achieved on wall function grids which
   require just the half of grid nodes of wall resolving grids. The
   numerical solutions computed by wall function computations reveal
   energetic unsteady flow fields with complex coherent vortical structures
   separated from obstacle edges, whose accuracy is better than those
   obtained by the unsteady RANS computations on the wall integration grid.
   Wall function solutions appear to be comparable to the wall-resolving
   DES solutions in most regions except at the junction of obstacle and the
   bottom wall where the flow is dominated by the horseshoe vortex with
   intense unsteadiness. The result confirms that DES with wall function
   approximation can reasonably resolves geometry-induced unsteady
   three-dimensional turbulent motions.}},

Title = {{Complex Versus Simple Ankle Movement Training in Stroke Using
   Telerehabilitation: A Randomized Controlled Trial}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL THERAPY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{92}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background. Telerehabilitation allows rehabilitative training to
   continue remotely after discharge from acute care and can include
   complex tasks known to create rich conditions for neural change.
   Objectives. The purposes of this study were: (1) to explore the
   feasibility of using telerehabilitation to improve ankle dorsiflexion
   during the swing phase of gait in people with stroke and (2) to compare
   complex versus simple movements of the ankle in promoting behavioral
   change and brain reorganization.
   Design. This study was a pilot randomized controlled trial.
   Setting. Training was done in the participant's home. Testing was done
   in separate research labs involving functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) and multi-camera gait analysis.
   Patients. Sixteen participants with chronic stroke and impaired ankle
   dorsiflexion were assigned randomly to receive 4 weeks of
   telerehabilitation of the paretic ankle.
   Intervention. Participants received either computerized complex movement
   training (track group) or simple movement training (move group).
   Measurements. Behavioral changes were measured with the 10-m walk test
   and gait analysis using a motion capture system. Brain reorganization
   was measured with ankle tracking during MM.
   Results. Dorsiflexion during gait was significantly larger in the track
   group compared with the move group. For fMRI, although the volume,
   percent volume, and intensity of cortical activation failed to show
   significant changes, the frequency count of the number of participants
   showing an increase versus a decrease in these values from pretest to
   posttest measurements was significantly different between the 2 groups,
   with the track group decreasing and the move group increasing.
   Limitations. Limitations of this study were that no follow-up test was
   conducted and that a small sample size was used.
   Conclusions. The results suggest that telerehabilitation, emphasizing
   complex task training with the paretic limb, is feasible and can be
   effective in promoting further dorsiflexion in people with chronic
   stroke.}},

   in the static limit is 4.7 x 10(-16) cm(2). Modification of vertical bar

Abstract = {{Optimizing heat transfer during the charge and discharge of thermal
   stores is crucial for high performance of solar thermal systems for
   domestic and commercial applications. This study models a sensible water
   storage tank for which discharge is accomplished using a heat exchanger
   immersed in the storage fluid. The heat exchanger is a two-dimensional
   isothermal cylinder in an adiabatic enclosure with no initial
   stratification. An adiabatic shroud and baffle whose geometry is
   parametrically varied is placed around and below the cylinder. Transient
   numerical simulations of the discharge process are obtained for 10(5) <
   Ra-D < 10(7), and estimates of the time needed to discharge a given
   fraction of the initial stored energy are obtained. We find that a short
   baffle is least effective in increasing heat transfer rates. The
   performance benefit is greatest early in the transient discharge period
   when the buoyant flow in the store is strongest. As with all flow

Title = {{Mining Low-Support Discriminative Patterns from Dense and

Abstract = {{Discriminative patterns can provide valuable insights into data sets
   with class labels, that may not be available from the individual
   features or the predictive models built using them. Most existing
   approaches work efficiently for sparse or low-dimensional data sets.
   However, for dense and high-dimensional data sets, they have to use high
   thresholds to produce the complete results within limited time, and
   thus, may miss interesting low-support patterns. In this paper, we
   address the necessity of trading off the completeness of discriminative
   pattern discovery with the efficient discovery of low-support
   discriminative patterns from such data sets. We propose a family of
   antimonotonic measures named SupMaxK that organize the set of
   discriminative patterns into nested layers of subsets, which are
   progressively more complete in their coverage, but require increasingly
   more computation. In particular, the member of SupMaxK with K = 2, named
   SupMaxPair, is suitable for dense and high-dimensional data sets.
   Experiments on both synthetic data sets and a cancer gene expression
   data set demonstrate that there are low-support patterns that can be
   discovered using SupMaxPair but not by existing approaches. Furthermore,
   we show that the low-support discriminative patterns that are only
   discovered using SupMaxPair from the cancer gene expression data set are
   statistically significant and biologically relevant. This illustrates
   the complementarity of SupMaxPair to existing approaches for
   discriminative pattern discovery. The codes and data set for this paper
   are available at http://vk.cs.umn.edu/SMP/.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AIR \& WASTE MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{170-182}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Portable 24-hr sampling units were used to collect air samples from
   eight biofilters on four animal feeding operations. The biofilters were
   located on a dairy, a swine nursery, and two swine finishing farms.
   Biofilter media characteristics (age, porosity, density, particle size,
   water absorption capacity, pressure drop) and ammonia (NH3), hydrogen
   sulfide (H2S), sulfur dioxide (SO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide
   (N2O) reduction efficiencies of the biofilters were assessed. The deep
   bed biofilters at the dairy farm, which were in use for a few months,
   had the most porous media and lowest unit pressure drops. The average
   media porosity and density were 75\% and 180 kg/m(3), respectively
   Reduction efficiencies of H2S and NH3 (biofilter 1: 64\% NH3, 76\% H2S;
   biofilter 2: 53\% NH3, 85\% H2S) were close to those reported for
   pilot-scale biofilters. No N2O production was measured at the dairy
   firm. The highest H2S, SO2, NH3, and CH4 reduction efficiencies were
   measured from a flat-bed biofilter at the swine nursery firm. However,
   the highest N2O generation (29.2\%) was also measured from this
   biofilter This flat-bed biofilter media was dense and had the lowest
   porosity A garden sprinkler was used to add water to this biofilter
   which may have filled media pores and caused N2O production under
   anaerobic conditions. Concentrations of H2S and NH3 were determined
   using the portable 24-hr sampling units and compared to ones measured
   with a semicontinuous gas sampling system at one farm. Flat-bed
   biofilters at the swine finishing farms also produced low amounts of
   N2O. The N2O production rate of the newer media (2 years old) with
   higher porosity was lower than that of older media (3 years old) (P =
   0.042).
   Implications: Media characteristics and gas reduction efficiencies of
   eight field-scale biofilters were evaluated. The media characteristics
   measured in this study indicated that media older than 3 years should be
   tested for high-pressure drops and nitrous oxide (N2O) production. The
   results also indicated that regular water addition can improve gas
   reduction efficiencies of biofilters but adding excessive amounts of
   water can cause N2O production. Uniform water distribution can be a
   challenge.}},

Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{149}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{ZSM-5 zeolite crystals with secondary mesopores were synthesized by
   alkaline desilication and surfactant-induced re-assembly of dissolved
   species (i.e., silicates, aluminosilicates and zeolite crystal
   fragments) originating from the parent ZSM-5 crystals. The meso-zeolite
   products exhibit a dual-mesopore structure in which the smaller
   mesopores (ca. 3 nm) are attributed to surfactant-induced micelle
   formation involving dissolved species, and larger mesopores (ca. 10-30
   nm) result from desilication processes occurring under the alkaline
   reaction conditions. The external surface area (i.e., the surface area
   due to mesopores, macropores and the external particle surface) of the
   meso-zeolite materials depends on the Si/Al ratio, the hydroxide
   concentration and the presence of surfactant, and it reaches values as
   high as 327 m(2) g(-1) when a surfactant is used. The crystallinity of
   the highest surface-area meso-zeolite is well preserved, maintaining
   values of ca. 83\% (on the basis of micropore volume) or ca. 77\% (on
   the basis of X-ray diffraction intensities) of the parent zeolite
   structures. Further physicochemical characterization by Al-27 and Si-29
   magic-angle-spinning solid-state NMR spectroscopy, scanning and
   transmission electron microscopy, temperature-programmed ammonia
   desorption measurements, and inductively coupled plasma elementary
   analysis support the hypothesis that re-assembly of dissolved species of
   zeolite crystals occurred by surfactant-induced micellization, resulting
   in the high external surface area of the meso-zeolite materials. (C)

Abstract = {{A micromagnetic numerical technique has been used to demonstrate how
   intergranular exchange coupling and intrinsic anisotropy field

   separates the effects of intergranular exchange coupling and anisotropy
   dispersion by finding their correlation to differentiated M-H curves
   with different initial magnetization states, even in the presence of
   thermal fluctuation. The validity of this method is investigated with a
   series of intergranular exchange couplings and anisotropy dispersions
   for different media thickness. A relationship between the
   auto-correlation function of an ac-erased sample and dispersion of the
   exchange interaction is demonstrated. Utilizing magnetization
   auto-correlation functions, the magnetic intergranular exchange coupling
   statistics show a correlation with the auto-correlation function shape

Abstract = {{Tin dioxide is emerging as an important material for use in copper
   indium gallium diselenide based solar cells. Amorphous tin dioxide may
   be used as a glass overlayer for covering the entire device and
   protecting it against water permeation. Tin dioxide is also a viable
   semiconductor candidate to replace the wide band gap zinc oxide window
   layer to improve the long-term device reliability. The film properties
   required by these two applications are different. Amorphous films have
   superior water permeation resistance while polycrystalline films
   generally have better charge carrier transport properties. Thus, it is
   important to understand how to tune the structure of tin dioxide films
   between amorphous and polycrystalline. Using X-ray diffraction (XRD) and
   Hall-effect measurements, we have studied the structure and electrical
   properties of tin dioxide films deposited by magnetron sputtering as a
   function of deposition temperature, sputtering power, feed gas
   composition and film thickness. Films deposited at room temperature are
   semicrystalline with nanometer size SnO2 crystals embedded in an
   amorphous matrix. Film crystallinity increases with deposition
   temperature. When the films are crystalline, the X-ray diffraction
   intensity pattern is different than that of the powder diffraction
   pattern indicating that the films are textured with (101) and (211)
   directions oriented parallel to the surface normal. This texturing is
   observed on a variety of substrates including soda-lime glass (SLG),
   Mo-coated soda-lime glass and (100) silicon. Addition of oxygen to the
   sputtering gas, argon, increases the crystallinity and changes the
   orientation of the tin dioxide grains: (110) XRD intensity increases
   relative to the (101) and (211) diffraction peaks and this effect is
   observed both on Mo-coated SLG and (100) silicon wafers. Films with
   resistivities ranging between 8 m Omega cm and 800 m Omega cm could be
   deposited. The films are n-type with carrier concentrations in the 3 x
   10(18) cm(-3) to 3 x 10(20) cm(-3) range. Carrier concentration
   decreases when the oxygen concentration in the feed gas is above 5\%.
   Electron mobilities range from 1 to 7 cm(2)/V s and increase with
   increasing film thickness, oxygen addition to the feed gas and film
   crystallinity. Electron mobilities in the 1-3 cm(2)/V s range can be
   obtained even in semicrystalline films. Initial deposition rates range
   from 4 nm/min at low sputtering power to 11 nm/min at higher powers.
   However, deposition rate decreases with deposition time by as much as
   30\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental study of natural convection in fluid-superposed porous
   layers heated locally from below is reported. Measurements are made in a
   rectangular chamber with 3 mm DIA glass beads as the porous layer and
   distilled water as the saturating fluid. The effects of the
   heater-to-cavity length ratio and the porous layer-to-cavity height
   ratio on the overall heat transfer coefficients are reported. Average
   heat transfer coefficients over the heated surface increase with a
   decrease in porous layer-to-cavity height ratio, but no clear effect of
   heater-to-cavity length ratio is seen. Temperature profiles in the
   domain reveal a plume like flow with a single pair of circulating cells
   and evidence of convective motion inside the porous layer. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) technique was applied to
   quantify nutrients (Mg, Ca, Na, and K) in spinach rtr.d rice and to
   discriminate pesticide-contaminated products in a rapid manner. Standard
   reference materials (spinachlmves and unpolished rice flour) were used
   to establish a relationship between LIBS intensity and the concentration
   of each environment (Mg, Ca, Na, and K) (i.e., calibration line). The
   limits of detection (LODs) for Mg, Ca, Na, and K were found to be 29.63,
   102 65,- 36.36, and 44.46 mg/kg in spinach and 7.54, 1.76, 4.19, and
   6.70 mg/kg in unpolished rice, respectively. Concentraions of those
   nutrient elements present in spinach and unpolished rice from a local
   market were determined by using the LIBS TECHNIQUEand compared with
   those measured with ICP-OES, showing good agreement The data also
   suggested that with the chemometric method (PLS-DA) could be a great
   tool to distinguish pesticide contaminated samples from pesticide free
   samples in a rapid manner even though they have similar elemental
   compositions. Misclassification rates were found to be 0 and 2\% for
   clean spinach and pesticide-contaminated spinach, respectively, by
   applying the PLS-DA model established from the training set of data to
   predict the classes of test samples.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a variety of biomimetic constructs have emerged which
   mimic the bioactive sequences found in the natural extracellular matrix
   (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin (FN) that promote cell adhesion as
   well as proliferation on artificially functionalized interfaces. Much
   interest lies in investigating the ability of the ECM mimetic materials
   in regulating a number of vital cell functions including
   differentiation, gene expression, migration, and proliferation. A
   peptide amphiphile PR\_b containing both the cell adhesive GRGDSP and
   synergistic PHSRN peptide sequences was developed in our group that was
   shown to support enhanced cell proliferation and ECM FN secretion as
   compared to GRGDSP and FN functionalized interfaces. In this study, we
   have investigated the binding affinity of the PR\_b peptide ligand with
   the FN cell surface receptor, the alpha(s)beta(1) integrin. We compared
   PR\_b functionalized surfaces with FN and BSA coated surfaces and GRGDSP
   fiinctionalized surfaces in terms of promoting intracellular signaling
   cascades that are essential for enhanced cellular activity.
   Specifically, we studied the phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase
   (FAK) at tyrosine residues Y397 and 1576 and the formation of cyclin D1,
   both of which are intracellular markers of integrin mediated attachment
   of cells, signaling pathways, and progression of cell cycle. FAK and
   cyclin D1 encourage enhanced cell proliferation, differentiation, and
   gene expression. Our results show that the PR\_b peptide ligand has a
   specific and strong binding affinity for the alpha(s)beta(1) integrin
   with a dissociation constant of 76.3 +/- 6.3 nM. The PR\_b peptide
   ligands supported enhanced FAK phosphorylation activity and increased
   cyclin D1 formation as compared to the widely used GRGDSP ligand, the
   native protein FN (positive control), and BSA nonadhesive surfaces
   (negative control). These results encourage the use of the FN mimetic
   PR\_b peptide in functionalizing biomaterials for potential tissue
   engineering and therapeutic applications.}},

Abstract = {{Restriction factors, such as the retroviral complementary DNA deaminase
   APOBEC3G, are cellular proteins that dominantly block virus
   replication(1-3). The AIDS virus, human immuno deficiency virus type 1
   (HIV-1), produces the accessory factor Vif, which counteracts the host's
   antiviral defence by hijacking a ubiquitin ligase complex, containing
   CUL5, ELOC, ELOB and a RING-box protein, and targeting APOBEC3G for
   degradation(4-10). Here we reveal, using an affinity tag/purification
   mass spectrometry approach, that Vif additionally recruits the
   transcription cofactor CBF-beta to this ubiquitin ligase complex.
   CBF-beta, which normally functions in concert with RUNX DNA binding
   proteins, allows the reconstitution of a recombinant six-protein
   assembly that elicits specific polyubiquitination activity with
   APOBEC3G, but not the related deaminase APOBEC3A. Using RNA knockdown
   and genetic complementation studies, we also demonstrate that CBF-beta
   is required for Vif-mediated degradation of APOBEC3G and therefore for
   preserving HIV-1 infectivity. Finally, simian immunodeficiency virus
   (SIV) Vif also binds to and requires CBF-beta to degrade rhesus macaque
   APOBEC3G, indicating functional conservation. Methods of disrupting the
   CBF-beta-Vif interaction might enable HIV-1 restriction and provide a
   supplement to current antiviral therapies that primarily target viral
   proteins.}},

Title = {{Fate of Naphthalene in Laboratory-Scale Bioretention Cells: Implications

Abstract = {{Bioretention cells are increasingly popular in low-impact development as
   a means to sustainably mitigate the environmental problems associated
   with stormwater runoff. Yet, much remains to be known regarding the
   removal and ultimate fate of pollutants such as petroleum hydrocarbons
   in bioretention cells. In this work, laboratory-scale bioretention cells
   were constructed inside sealed glass columns. The columns were
   periodically spiked with C-14-naphthalene over a 5-month period and the
   fate of this representative hydrocarbon and the influence of vegetation
   on naphthalene fate was studied. Three column setups were used: one
   planted with a legume (Purple Prairie Clover, Dalea purpureum), one
   planted with grass (Blue-Joint Grass, Calamagrostis canadensis), and one
   unplanted (i.e., control). Overall naphthalene removal efficiency was
   93\% for the planted columns and 78\% for the control column. Adsorption
   to soil wee.; the dominant naphthalene removal mechanism (56-73\% of
   added naphthalene), although mineralization (12-18\%) and plant uptake
   (2-23\%) were also important. Volatilization was negligible (<0.04\%).
   Significant enrichment of naphthalene-degrading bacteria occurred due to
   contaminant exposure and plant growth as evidenced by increased
   biodegradation activity and increased naphthalene dioxygenase gene
   concentrations in the bioretention media. This research suggests that
   bioretention is a viable solution for sustainable petroleum hydrocarbon
   removal from stormwater, and that vegetation can enhance overall
   performance and stimulate biodegradation.}},

   (STO) devices with a built-in hard axis polarizer have been studied.
   This design allows for an external-field-free STO. The time domain
   oscillation signals give direct evidence of higher output from the hard
   axis polarizer STO, which agrees with spectroscopic results. The hard
   axis polarizer STO generates a higher power because of the larger slope
   of the magnetoresistance-angle curve at the lowest energy potential.
   Furthermore, the hard axis polarizer STO shows a low critical current
   indicating the large spin torque effect when two magnetic layers are in
   the 90 degrees configuration. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The cancer sensor based on suspended layer-by-layer self-assembled
   graphene reported in the paper exhibits an ultra high sensitivity due to
   graphene material properties in nature. By simply immersing the

   graphene nanoplatelets are self-assembled in the channel as the sensing
   region, followed by SF6 dry etching to suspend the structure.
   Conductance shift curves demonstrate that the suspended graphene sensors
   functionalized with specific anti-PSA antibodies as bioreceptor are
   capable of detecting prostate specific antigen down to 0.4 fg/ml (11
   aM), at least one order of magnitude lower than unsuspended devices. The
   noise spectra analysis confirms the lower level of 1/f noise in
   suspended graphene devices. Carbon nanotube sensor under the same
   conditions of design, manufacture, and measurement are implemented to
   compare with graphene devices, showing the prominent advantages of

Abstract = {{We propose a new direct writing nanolithography approach using a
   plasmonic focusing device and a nano silver mirror with dual-wavelength
   illumination for high exposure depth. Arrays of pyramid aperture are
   used to focus the incident light beams into 80 nm light spots. The
   pyramid combined with a thin silver film coated on the substrate
   constructs a surface plasmon polaritons (SPP) coupling cavity, which
   amplifies the intensity of the light field in it by SPP effect and
   resonance. The transmission depth of the standing wave formed by forward
   and reflected light could reach hundreds of nanometers. Two lasers with
   different wavelengths are used as illumination sources to homogenize the
   light field through complementation between the two standing waves.
   Simulation results show by using 355 nm and 441 nm wavelengths, a space
   of 44 nm at the bottom of the photoresist could be obtained after
   exposure and development. The feature size of resist patterns could be
   further scaled down, depending on the optimization of parameters of

Abstract = {{Stents are often used to maintain the diameter of the coronary artery
   lumen. The insertion of a stent into an artery often results in the
   accumulation of scar tissue in response to the stent's presence.
   Drug-eluting stents dispense a drug designed to limit the growth of such
   scar tissue, thus reducing the likelihood of restenosis. The trajectory
   of the eluted drug is of critical clinical importance. The bifurcation
   of the drug between the artery tissue and the blood-carrying lumen is a
   highly relevant issue to the success of stenting. Prior simulations of
   this issue have dealt with highly specific situations. Here, the problem
   is nondimensionalized in order to obtain universal solutions. The
   results, in terms of the Sherwood number, are reported in terms of the
   Reynolds and Schmidt numbers, and a mass-transfer version of the Biot
   number. It was found that the highest rates of mass transfer occurred at
   the forwardmost portion of the stent. The rate of drug delivery to the
   lumen was greater than that to the artery tissue. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Network structure varies across cities. This variation may yield
   important knowledge about how the internal structure of the city affects
   its performance. This paper systematically compares a set of surface
   transportation network structure variables (connectivity, hierarchy,
   circuity, treeness, entropy, accessibility) across the 50 largest
   metropolitan areas in the United States. A set of scaling parameters are
   discovered to show how network size and structure vary with city size.
   These results suggest that larger cities are physically more
   inter-connected. Hypotheses are presented as to why this might obtain.
   This paper then consistently measures and ranks access to jobs across 50
   US metropolitan areas. It uses that accessibility measure, along with
   network structure variables and city size to help explain
   journey-to-work time and auto mode share in those cities. A 1 percent
   increase in accessibility reduces average metropolitan commute times by
   about 90 seconds each way. A 1 percent increase in network connectivity
   reduces commute time by 0.1 percent. A 1 percent increase in
   accessibility results in a 0.0575 percent drop in auto mode share, while
   a 1 percent increase in treeness reduces auto mode share by 0.061

Abstract = {{Experimental studies of gas-phase nanoparticle coating by photoinduced

   thermal reaction sequences involving gas-phase and surface reactions to
   describe the nanoparticle coating process. Modeled results of the
   photo-CVD process indicate that the dominant reactions for the
   production of silica coatings on the surface of the nanoparticles are
   the photodecomposition of TEOS and the removal of surface ethyl groups
   from adsorbed TEOS species. Relative concentrations of gas-phase and
   surface species are compared for different model configurations and

   experimental findings and demonstrate that coating thickness increases

Abstract = {{There is an emerging viewpoint that the sediment flux at a given point
   on the landscape may be influenced by landscape properties in a region
   extending away from the point of interest. Using a general sediment
   transport model that incorporates this non-local nature via fractional
   derivatives, we find a strong asymmetry in the direction in which the
   non-locality affects a given point: For erosional landscapes, physically
   plausible elevation profiles are obtained only when the spatial
   influence is restricted to the region upstream of the point of interest.
   By contrast, in depositional landscapes, the non-local model is
   guaranteed to produce physically plausible topographic profiles only
   when the spatial influence is restricted to the region downstream of the
   point of interest. These results suggest that information flows
   downstream in an erosional landscape and upstream in depositional
   landscapes. Citation: Voller, V. R., V. Ganti, C. Paola, and E.

Abstract = {{Direct targeting of dendritic cells is an ideal goal for DNA vaccine
   delivery in order to stimulate both arms of the immune system. However,
   dendritic cells are often difficult to transfect using nonviral
   polyplexes. Here we show that transfecting bystander cells such as
   fibroblasts with PEI/DNA complexes leads to efficient cross-presentation
   of a model antigen by dendritic cells and subsequent activation of
   antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. Maturation of dendritic cells is also
   stimulated after co-culture with transfected fibroblasts. Such outcomes
   depend on a proper balance between transfection efficiency and
   polyplex-induced cytotoxicity in the fibroblasts. In fact, substantial
   cytotoxicity is desirable and even necessary for cross-presentation and
   cross-priming of T cells. This study illustrates a new pathway of
   polymer-based DNA vaccine delivery via bystander cells without direct
   targeting of antigen-presenting cells and highlights the importance of
   exploiting polymer-induced cytotoxicity for the benefit of immune
   activation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Research is conducted on the discharge rhythm properties of an
   artificial biological neural network with lateral inhibition mechanism,
   which is modeled by Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) equations and coupled by
   small-world (SW) network. The results show that the excitation frequency
   increases almost linearly along with increasing stimulation intensity,
   conversely, the average excitation intensity decreases near linearly
   with the increase of stimulation intensity, when the current stimulation
   intensity exceeds threshold value. In addition, the influence of
   coupling strength on excitation properties is noticeable under
   relatively weak stimulation. The stronger is the coupling strength, the
   lower is the excitation frequency, whereas the stronger is the coupling
   strength the greater is the excitation intensity. However, the influence
   of coupling strength on excitation properties is unnoticeable under
   relatively strong stimulation. For comparison, discharge rhythm
   properties of the neural networks under random connection and full

Abstract = {{Hexagonally ordered spherical and cylindrical morphologies (P(6)/mmm and
   P(6)/mm space group symmetries) have been identified in bulk
   poly(styrene-b-isoprene-b-styrene-b-ethylene oxide) (SISO) tetrablock
   terpolymers. These materials were synthesized by adding up to 32\% by
   volume O blocks to a parent hydroxy-terminated SIS triblock copolymer
   containing 40\% S by volume, and the resulting morphologies were
   characterized by small-angle X-ray scattering, transmission electron
   microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical
   spectroscopy. Disordered, spherical and cylindrical phases were
   documented with increasino content, where both ordered states exhibit
   hexagonal symmetry. Theoretical calculations based on a numerical
   self-consistent field theory for polymers provide crucial insights into
   the molecular configurations associated with these morphologies. These
   results offer a new approach to independently control domain shape and
   packing in block copolymer melts through manipulation of the magnitude
   and sequencing of the binary segment segment interactions (chi(SI) <=
   chi(SO) <= chi(IO)), which dictate core segregation and the effective

Abstract = {{Basal ganglia circuits are affected in neurological disorders such as
   Parkinson's disease (PD), essential tremor, dystonia and Tourette
   syndrome. Understanding the structural and functional connectivity of
   these circuits is critical for elucidating the mechanisms of the
   movement and neuropsychiatric disorders, and is vital for developing new
   therapeutic strategies such as deep brain stimulation (DBS). Knowledge
   about the connectivity of the human basal ganglia and thalamus has
   rapidly evolved over recent years through non-invasive imaging
   techniques, but has remained incomplete because of insufficient
   resolution and sensitivity of these techniques. Here, we present an
   imaging and computational protocol designed to generate a comprehensive
   in vivo and subject-specific, three-dimensional model of the structure
   and connections of the human basal ganglia. High-resolution structural
   and functional magnetic resonance images were acquired with a 7-Tesla
   magnet. Capitalizing on the enhanced signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and
   enriched contrast obtained at high-field MRI, detailed structural and
   connectivity representations of the human basal ganglia and thalamus
   were achieved. This unique combination of multiple imaging modalities
   enabled the in-vivo visualization of the individual human basal ganglia
   and thalamic nuclei, the reconstruction of seven white-matter pathways
   and their connectivity probability that, to date, have only been
   reported in animal studies, histologically, or group-averaged MRI
   population studies. Also described are subject-specific parcellations of
   the basal ganglia and thalamus into sub-territories based on their
   distinct connectivity patterns. These anatomical connectivity findings
   are supported by functional connectivity data derived from resting-state
   functional MRI (R-fMRI). This work demonstrates new capabilities for
   studying basal ganglia circuitry, and opens new avenues of investigation
   into the movement and neuropsychiatric disorders, in individual human
   subjects.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrated spin transfer torque (STT) programming of
   dipole coupled nanomagnets using magnetic tunnel junctions. The STT
   write operations were performed in conjunction with a clock field used
   in magnetic quantum cellular automata (MQCA) operations. The spacing and
   number of nanomagnets in the transmission line strongly affected the STT
   programming of the individual pillars. These MQCA transmission lines
   ranged in length from 2 elements to 20 elements, while device sizes
   ranged between 50 nm x 80 nm and 70 nm x 100 nm with spacing between 10
   nm and 15 nm. With the application of the clock field, currents of
   100-200 mu A are sufficient to STT program the device. The demonstration
   of STT programming of individual nanomagnets in a dipole coupled array
   marks a significant step forward for applications such as MQCA logic

   structure of Laplacian matrices of both classes of graphs, we derive
   explicit formulae for the transfer function from disturbances to the
   states of the nodes. For directed trees, we show that the worst-case
   componentwise amplification of disturbances is achieved at zero temporal
   frequency and that it is a convex function of edge weights. For directed
   1D and 2D lattices, we study the steady-state variance distribution in
   networks with leaders placed on the boundary. We show that as one moves
   away from leaders, the variance of the followers scales as a square-root
   function of node indices in 1D lattices and as a logarithmic function
   along the diagonal nodes in 2D lattices.}},

Abstract = {{The separation principle is the statement that under suitable conditions
   the design of stochastic control can be divided into two separate
   problems, one of optimal control with state information and one of
   filtering. The literature over the past 50 years contains several
   derivations where subtle difficulties are overlooked and inadmissible
   shortcuts taken. Other contributions that have established the
   separation principle under various hypotheses require considerable
   mathematical sophistication, which makes the ideas difficult to include
   in standard textbooks. The contribution of the present work is a new set
   of conditions that are in line with basic engineering thinking and
   ensure that the separation principle holds. The feedback system is
   required to be well-posed in the sense that it defines a map between
   sample paths, representing signals rather than stochastic processes per
   se. This approach allows certain generalizations of the separation
   theorem to a wide class of feedback laws, models and stochastic noise,
   including martingales with possible jumps.}},

Abstract = {{This research focuses on the tracking control design for a camless
   engine valve actuator during engine speed transients. The cyclic but
   aperiodic valve reference signal to be tracked can be modeled using two
   different methods, i.e., as a combination of frequency varying sinusoids
   in the time domain or as a repetitive (periodic) signal in the
   rotational angle domain. The recently developed time-varying internal
   model based controller is ideally suited for both the approaches.
   Investigation of the continuous time and discrete domain implementations
   uncovers some unique characteristics resulting from the time-varying
   nature of the system which favor working in the discrete domain. A
   quantitative analysis comparing various performance metrics for the
   different approaches of modeling the reference signal helps highlight
   the relative advantages of each method. Finally, experimental results
   from a prototype camless engine valve actuation system help validate the
   overall effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The integration of rollover prevention and yaw stability control
   objectives in electronic stability control has traditionally been done
   based on a priority calculation. This paper focuses on an integrated
   electronic stability control system wherein the objectives of yaw
   stability and rollover prevention are addressed simultaneously, rather
   than one at a time. First, we show that staying on a desired planar
   trajectory at a specified speed results in an invariant rollover index.
   This implies that rollover prevention can be achieved whenever there is
   a danger of rollover only by reducing vehicle speed, since changing the
   desired vehicle trajectory is not a desirable option. In this regard, it
   is shown that a vehicle which reduces its speed before entering a sharp
   curve performs significantly better than a vehicle that uses
   differential braking during the turn for yaw stability control.
   Second, the paper explores how the use of steer-by-wire technology can
   address the trade-off between yaw stability, speed and rollover
   prevention performance. It is shown that the use of traditional
   steer-by-wire simply as an additional actuator cannot by itself
   ameliorate the trade-off.
   However, this trade-off can be eliminated if steer-by-wire is used to
   invert the direction of the roll angle of the vehicle. A new
   steer-by-wire algorithm that uses transient counter steering is shown to
   change the location of the rollover dynamics from the neighborhood of an
   unstable to a stable equilibrium. In this case, a desired trajectory can
   indeed be achieved by the vehicle at the same speed with a much smaller

Abstract = {{Dual decomposition coupled with the subgradient method has found
   application to optimal resource management in communication networks, as
   it can lead to distributed and scalable algorithms. Network
   entities-nodes or functional layers-exchange Lagrange multipliers and
   primal minimizers of the Lagrangian function towards optimizing a
   network-wide performance metric. It is of interest to study the
   performance of the resultant algorithms when such exchanges are delayed
   or lost. This paper deals with such asynchronous dual subgradient
   methods in separable convex programming. In this scenario, the
   subgradient vector is a sum of components, each possibly corresponding
   to an outdated Lagrange multiplier, and not the current one. A number of
   network entities is allowed to prematurely stop updating their
   corresponding variables, thereby effecting infinite delay between the
   current iterate and the multipliers used for a number of subgradient
   components. Conditions for convergence of the algorithm are developed.
   Specific applications include multipath routing in wireline networks and
   cross-layer optimization in wireless networks. Numerical tests for
   multipath routing in the Abilene network topology are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background, Motivation and Objective: We have previously presented a
   method of ultrasound image guidance known as a dual-mode ultrasound
   array (DMUA). A DMUA uses the same elements for imaging and therapy
   creating an inherent registration between the two modalities and
   allowing for precise HIFU targeting. Previous results have demonstrated
   the abilities of DMUAs on phantoms and in vitro tissues with offline
   data processing, here we present in vivo results from a fully
   functional, real-time implementation of a DMUA.
   Statement of Contribution/Methods: This system utilizes high-performance
   FPGAs and GPUs to implement a novel ultrasound-guided focused ultrasound
   (USgFUS) platform. This platform uses 33 frames per second synthetic
   aperture (SA) imaging to provide guidance for the selection of
   therapeutic targets. Single transmit focus (STF) imaging is interleaved
   with therapy at 1000 frame per second to provide real-time feedback on
   the treatment progress. The array contains a central opening to allow
   the coaxial alignment of a diagnostic transducer for image fusion
   between the diagnostic and DMUA imaging modalities.
   Results: A 3.5 MHz, 32 element DMUA was used for HIFU treatments in
   swine and rat animal models. The SA imaging allowed for the recognition
   of tissue structure and the tracking of natural tissue motion. STF
   imaging during therapy allowed for the detection of HIFU induced
   echogenic changes. The DMUA images allowed for the targeted placement of
   HIFU shots with sub-millimeter and millisecond spatial and temporal
   resolutions, respectively. Histological examinations have confirmed
   thermal lesion formation within the wall of the vessel.
   Discussion and Conclusions: Advances in computing power and array
   technology have enabled the development of a DMUA as a real-time USgFUS
   platform. These results represent the first in vivo demonstration of a
   DMUAs imaging and therapeutic capability. The system demonstrates the
   ability to image anatomical structures and deliver HIFU therapy safely
   and efficaciously.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of large, single crystals of cadmium zinc telluride
   (CZT) with uniform properties is key to improving the performance of
   gamma radiation detectors fabricated from them. Towards this goal, we
   discuss results obtained by computational models that provide a deeper
   understanding of crystal growth processes and how the growth of CZT can
   be improved. In particular, we discuss methods that may be implemented
   to lessen the deleterious interactions between the ampoule wall and the
   growing crystal via engineering a convex solidification interface. For
   vertical Bridgman growth, a novel, bell-curve furnace temperature
   profile is predicted to achieve macroscopically convex solid-liquid
   interface shapes during melt growth of CZT in a multiple-zone furnace.
   This approach represents a significant advance over traditional
   gradient-freeze profiles, which always yield concave interface shapes,
   and static heat transfer designs, such as pedestal design, that achieve
   convex interfaces over only a small portion of the growth run.
   Importantly, this strategy may be applied to any Bridgman configuration
   that utilizes multiple, controllable heating zones. Realizing a convex
   solidification interface via this adaptive bell-curve furnace profile is
   postulated to result in better crystallinity and higher yields than
   conventional CZT growth techniques.}},

Abstract = {{We propose that a weak compatibility condition predicts the elongated
   directions for Widmanstatten type precipitates. The distribution of the
   elongated directions of precipitates lies on a family of
   crystallographically equivalent cones in 3D determined by a certain
   transformation stretch matrix obtained independently. A 3D visualization
   and digitization method is developed to show how the cone variants
   control the preferred growth directions during precipitation of Sb2Te3
   in a (5 mu m)(3) PbTe matrix. A series of two-dimensional secondary
   electron images are acquired along the direction perpendicular to the
   imaging plane. By pixelating all the images and calculating the position
   vectors on the surface of each precipitate, the elongation directions
   are calculated using a 3-dimensional ellipsoidal fitting for 182
   precipitates. The 3D plot of the elongation directions shows that their
   spacial orientations are close to four predicted cones with a standard
   deviation of 5.6 degrees. The length along the elongation directions
   reveals an asymmetric distribution with a mean value of about 240 nm.
   The total volume fraction of the precipitates is 8.3 \%. The average
   area of the precipitates per volume is 0.68 mu m(-1) by one point
   statistical calculation. These results build on our study presented in
   {[}1] by analyzing a significantly bigger data set and by including the

Abstract = {{Due to the limited power constraint in sensors, dynamic scheduling with
   data quality management is strongly preferred in long lifetime
   monitoring applications. But typical techniques treat data management as
   an isolated process on only selected individual nodes, e.g. the centroid
   node. In this paper, we propose and evaluate an aggressive data
   reduction algorithm based on error inference within sensor segments. The
   architecture integrates three parallel dynamic error control mechanisms
   to optimize the trade-off between energy saving and data validity. We
   demonstrate that not only substantial energy savings can be achieved but
   also that an error bound specified by the application can be guaranteed.
   Moreover, we have investigate the system performance by using the
   realistic historical soil temperature data as an experimental context.
   The experimental results demonstrate that the system error meets the
   specified error tolerance and produces up to a 50 percent of the energy
   savings compared to several sensing schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Control of impulsive noise is one important challenge for the practical
   implementation of active noise control (ANC) systems. The advantages and
   disadvantages of popular filtered-X least mean square (FXLMS) ANC
   algorithm and nonlinear filtered-X least mean M-estimate (FXLMM)
   algorithm are discussed in this paper. A new modified FXLMM algorithm is
   also proposed to achieve better performance in controlling impulsive
   noise. Computer simulations are carried out for all the three algorithms
   and the results are presented and analyzed. The results show that the
   FXLMM and modified FXLMM algorithms are more robust in suppressing the
   adverse effect of sudden large amplitude impulses than FXLMS algorithm.
   In particular, the proposed modified FXLMM algorithm can achieve better
   stability without sacrificing the performance of residual noise when
   encountering impulses.}},

Abstract = {{The frost growth process in low temperature air-coolers of a
   refrigeration system is described by a complex set of partial
   differential equations which do not lend themselves to direct analytical
   solution. Although various forms of lumped and distributed models have
   been developed, they are often difficult to work with because of their
   complexity. Recent numerical solution schemes, either for the governing
   equations themselves or for simplified approximations of them, have been
   growing in popularity as computing power increases. Such solution
   schemes can yield excellent results when compared to experiments, but
   the time required to construct and solve them is great and good
   computing resources are needed.
   Owing to the difficulty in using both approximate and numerical
   solutions, there is a continuing demand for correlations that are
   capable of predicting frost layer thickness with reasonable accuracy
   over a wide range of conditions. Many correlations have been presented,
   but have not met with good results outside narrow ranges of conditions
   specific to certain types of experimental apparatuses. It is thus
   desirable to obtain a more general correlation based on the
   consideration of the physical behavior during frost growth as opposed to
   the pure regression fits common to most current correlations. The
   correlation detailed herein is presented as a potential solution, as
   care has been given to account for the physical behavior of the frost
   layer during growth.
   A particular functional form is chosen to mimic the solutions to other
   physical processes that exhibit similar behavior, such as the velocity
   profile in growing boundary layers and transient heat conduction.
   Significant parameters during frost growth are included in the form of
   dimensionless variables and placed in the correlation according to their
   overall influence on the growth process. Remaining variances in the
   growth profile, resulting from the impossibility of capturing exact
   behavior with a correlation, are accounted for by strategic inclusion of
   experimental coefficients.
   The correlation is developed based on transient frost thickness data
   obtained using high accuracy visual methods for validation. The model is
   then extended to include data from many different sources, which allows
   for the coverage of wider ranges of conditions and eliminates design
   specifics of the apparatus as a factor in prediction. The tradeoff for
   such generality is a slight reduction in accuracy over the narrower
   range of experimental conditions used initially. Results show that the
   correlation is able to match frost growth trends with good accuracy
   across a wide spectrum of conditions. Results compare favorably with the
   predictions of other correlations.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic jet arrays driven by a piston-diaphragm structure with a
   translational motion were fabricated. A piezo-bow actuator generating
   large translational displacements at a high working frequency was used
   to drive the jets. Vibration analysis with a laser vibrometer shows the
   peak-to-peak displacement of the piston inside the jet cavity of about
   0.5 mm at the second resonant vibrational frequency of 1,240 Hz. In this
   driving condition, the peak velocity of a 20-orifice jet array reaches
   45 m/s for each orifice with a total power consumption of 1.6 W. Heat
   transfer performance of the jet array was tested on a 100-mm-long single
   channel of a 26-channel heat sink. The synthetic jet flow impinges on
   the tips of the fins. A cross flow through the channel enters from the
   two ends of the channel, and exits from the middle. Results show that
   the activation of jets generates a unit-average heat transfer
   enhancement of 9.3\% when operating with a channel flow velocity of 14.7
   m/s, and 23.1\% when operating with a channel flow velocity of 8 m/s.
   The effects of various choices for orifice configuration and different
   dimensionless distances from the fin tips, z/d, on jet performance were
   evaluated. By decreasing the length of the fin channel from 100 aim to
   89 mm and reducing the orifice number of the jet array from 20 to 18,
   jet peak velocities of about 54 m/s can be obtained with the same power
   consumption, and a heat transfer enhancement of 31.0\% from the jets can
   be achieved on the 89-mm-long heat sink channel with a flow velocity of
   8 m/s.}},

Abstract = {{A synthetic jet is an intermittent jet which issues through an orifice
   from a closed cavity over half of an oscillation cycle. Over the other
   half, the flow is drawn back through the same orifice into the cavity as
   a sink flow. The flow is driven by an oscillating diaphragm, which is
   one wall of the cavity. Synthetic jets are widely used for heat transfer
   enhancement since they are effective in disturbing and thinning thermal
   boundary layers on surfaces being cooled. They do so by creating an
   intermittently-impinging flow and by carrying to the hot surface
   turbulence generated by breakdown of the shear layer at the jet edge.
   The present study documents experimentally and computationally heat
   transfer performance of an array of synthetic jets used in a heat sink
   designed for cooling of electronics. This heat sink is comprised of a
   series of longitudinal fins which constitute walls of parallel channels.
   In the present design, the synthetic jet flow impinges on the tips of
   the fins. In the experiment, one channel of a 20-channel heat sink is
   tested. A second flow, perpendicular to the jet flow, passes through the
   channel, drawn by a vacuum system. Surface- and time-averaged heat
   transfer coefficients for the channel are measured, first with just the
   channel flow active then with the synthetic jets added. The purpose is
   to assess heat transfer enhancement realized by the synthetic jets. The
   multiple synthetic jets are driven by a single diaphragm which, in turn,
   is activated by a piezoelectrically-driven mechanism. The operating
   frequency of the jets is 1250 Hz with a cycle-maximum jet velocity of 50
   m/s, as measured with a miniature hot-film anemometer probe. hi the
   computational portion of the present paper, diaphragm movement is driven
   by a piston, simulating the experimental conditions. The flow is
   computed with a dynamic mesh using the commercial software package ANSYS
   FLUENT. Computed heat transfer coefficients show a good match with
   experimental values giving a maximum difference of less than 10\%. The
   effects of amplitude and frequency of the diaphragm motion are
   documented. Changes in heat transfer due to interactions between the
   synthetic jet flow and the channel flow are documented in cases of
   differing channel flow velocities as well as differing jet operating
   conditions. Heat transfer enhancement obtained by activating the
   synthetic jets can be as large as 300\% when the channel flow is of a
   low velocity compared to the synthetic jet peak velocity (as low as 4
   m/s in the present study).}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates heat transfer enhancement of an air-cooled
   plate-fin heat sink by introducing actively-driven agitating plates
   within its channels. The investigation was computationally conducted
   with a single actuated plate in a single channel constructed as two fin
   wall surfaces and one fin base surface. As air flows through the
   channel, the plate is vibrated transversely to agitate the channel flow
   and thereby enhance heat transfer. The channel flow and the actuated
   plate are considered to be driven by a fan and a piezoelectric stack,
   respectively. A Coefficient of Performance (COP), ratio of total heat
   dissipated from the fin channel to total electric power to drive the fan
   and the agitator plate, is employed to evaluate overall heat transfer
   enhancement. A short plate, i.e. a plate is only placed at the entrance
   of the channel, has been shown to possess higher COP than a longer
   plate, i.e. a plate that is extended to be over most of the channel. For
   the short plate, COP is higher when it is actuated than when it is
   stationary. Detailed turbulence-kinetic-energy contours indicate that
   the higher COPs are due to turbulence generated along the plate edges
   and streamwise acceleration and deceleration of the bulk channel flow;
   both are induced by the vibration of the plate. Within regions where the
   plate is present, the generated turbulence and the acceleration and
   deceleration augment heat transfer. For a short plate, the turbulence
   and unsteadiness are transported downstream of the actuated plate to
   increase heat transfer in that region. However, such turbulence and
   unsteadiness are drawn out of the channel without full benefit of
   agitation and heat transfer enhancement when the plate is long, as the
   plate's trailing edge is already close to the channel exit. This leads
   to a conclusion that the short plate is a better choice for active heat
   transfer enhancement.}},

Abstract = {{Thermotropic materials offer the potential to provide overheat
   protection for polymer absorbers. These materials are composed of a
   matrix material in which a second material, referred to as the
   scattering domain, is dispersed. Temperature control is accomplished by
   a reduction in transmittance at a desired temperature corresponding to
   the phase change temperature of the scattering domain. The phase change
   is accompanied by a change in refractive index. This paper describes a
   numerical model to predict the transmittance and reflectance of a
   polymer based thermotropic material as a function of the relative index
   of refraction m between the matrix and scattering domains, the
   scattering domain size and volume fraction f(v), and the sheet
   thickness. The thermotropic material is modelled as a non-absorbing
   sheet comprised of discrete anisotropic scattering spherical particles
   embedded in a matrix material. Under the assumption that the particles
   scatter incident radiation independently, the direction of scattered
   radiation is determined by Mie theory. A Monte Carlo numerical technique
   is used to predict the transmittance and reflectance for thermotropic
   materials in which the matrix index of refraction is 1.5 (representative
   of polymers) and the incident wavelength is 550 nm. Model results are
   validated by comparison to measured transmittance for 0.3 mm thick
   polymer samples containing particles with 200 nm radius at m ranging
   from 0.97 to 1.09 and f(v) ranging from 5 to 18.2\%. As the mismatch in
   refractive indices and volume fraction increase, the transmittance is
   reduced. For example, the transmittance is reduced from 83\% for m=1.02
   and f(v) = 9.6 to approximately 50\% for m=1.09 and f(v) = 13.5\% (200
   nm radius and 0.3 mm thick). (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Thin polymer films and tubes are under consideration as materials for
   use in roof top mounted solar thermal collectors. When polymer
   components are exposed to chlorinated water or UV light, degradation can
   lead to diminished mechanical performance and premature failure from
   rupture. In this paper, fracture toughness and crack growth of degraded
   polyethylene (MDPE) are investigated. Thin film PE samples (0.3mm thick)
   are degraded through exposure to 80 degrees C chlorinated water (8 ppm
   chlorine) for up to 45 days. The extent of degradation is quantified by
   carbonyl index, a nondestructive measure of the chemical byproduct of
   degradation, such that a high carbonyl index indicates significant
   degradation. Single edge notched specimens are prepared from the
   degraded samples and mode I fracture tests are performed. In one set of
   tests, samples are loaded at a constant rate and the fracture toughness
   of the film samples is evaluated by the essential work method. In
   another set of tests, samples are loaded under a constant load and the
   crack growth rate is measured. The data can be used to inform design of
   polymeric components for solar applications. For designs that use thin
   films, the fracture toughness can be used to obtain a conservative
   estimate of the critical stress (sigma(c)). Hence, an appropriate film
   thickness can be selected to ensure that stresses do not exceed the
   design stress value during the lifetime of the component. For designs
   that use tubes, the rate of crack growth can be used to estimate the
   time to rupture. Tube thickness can be selected to extend the lifetime.

Abstract = {{Currently, there is considerable interest in developing technologies
   that will allow the use of high-energy photon measurements from
   celestial X-ray sources for deep space relative navigation. The impetus
   for this is to reduce operational costs in the number of envisioned
   space missions that will require spacecraft to have autonomous, or
   semi-autonomous, navigation capabilities. For missions close to Earth,
   Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such as the U. S. Global
   Positioning System (GPS), are readily available for use and provide high
   accuracy navigation solutions that can be used for autonomous vehicle
   operation. However, for missions far from Earth, currently only a few
   navigation options exist and most do not allow autonomous operation.
   While the radio telemetry based solutions with proven high performance
   such as NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) can be used for these class of
   missions, latencies associated with servicing a fleet of vehicles, such
   as a constellation of communication or science observation spacecraft,
   may not be compatible with autonomous operations which require timely
   updates of navigation solutions. Thus, new alternative solutions are
   sought with DSN-like accuracy. Because of their highly predictable
   pulsations, pulsars emitting X-radiation are ideal candidates for this
   task. These stars are ubiquitous celestial sources that can be used to
   provide time, attitude, range, and range-rate measurements - key
   parameters for navigation. Laboratory modeling of pulsar signals and
   operational aspects such as identifying pulsar-spacecraft geometry and
   performing cooperative observations with data communication are
   addressed in this paper. Algorithms and simulation tools that will
   enable designing and analyzing X-ray navigation concepts for a cis-lunar
   operational scenario are presented. In this situation, a space vehicle
   with a large-sized X-ray detector will work cooperatively with a number
   of smaller vehicles with smaller-sized detectors to generate a relative
   navigation solution between a reference and partner vehicle. The
   development of a compact X-ray detector system is pivotal to the
   eventual deployment of such navigation systems. Therefore, efforts to
   design a small-packaged X-ray detector system along with the hardware,
   software and algorithm infrastructure required for testing and
   validating the system's performance are described in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Convective heat transfer enhancement on a wall of a narrow channel
   enhanced by high-frequency, translational oscillation of a thin agitator
   plate is described. The oscillation is realized using a piezoelectric
   stack actuator. Small amplitudes of the piezoelectric stack actuator
   were amplified through oval loop shell structures so that large
   translational amplitudes are provided to the thin plate agitator. Heat
   transfer tests were conducted with three operating frequencies resulting
   from three oval loop shell structures operating at their resonance
   frequencies. For each operating frequency, four different amplitudes
   (corresponding to different applied voltages to the piezoelectric
   stacks) were investigated. Three channel flow rates were tested. They
   represent laminar, transition, and turbulent flow regimes for a
   non-agitated channel. Running with agitation and channel flow allows a
   study of the agitation effect with different channel flow rates. The
   results show that the oscillating plate with a frequency of about 1,140
   Hz raises the convective heat transfer coefficient on the heated surface
   by 93\%, compared to a case with channel flow only. The flow rate was 45
   LPM, corresponding to the transitional flow regime in an un-agitated
   channel. The amplitude of oscillation was about 1.1 mm, peak-to-peak. It
   was found that the effect of cross flow is minimized with high
   oscillation frequency agitation regardless of channel flow velocity and
   flow regime of the unagitated flow. In addition, numerical simulations
   were performed to support the experimental results and understand
   underlying phenomena of translational agitation. Numerical simulation
   results match well with the experiments and provided good explanations
   of heat transfer enhancement from the translational agitator. The
   piezoelectrically-driven oscillating agitator plate coupled with
   traditional fan cooling shows promising potential for advanced air
   cooling applications.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer performance of air-cooled heat sinks must be improved to
   meet thermal management requirements of microelectronic devices. The
   present paper addresses this need by putting actuated plates into
   channels of a heat sink so that heat transfer is enhanced by the
   agitation and unsteadiness they generate. A proof-of-concept exercise
   was computationally conducted in a single channel consisting of one base
   surface, two fin wall surfaces, and an adiabatic fourth wall, with an
   actuated plate within the channel. Air flows through the channel, and
   the actuated plate generates periodic motion in a transverse direction
   to the air flow and to the fin surface. Turbulence is generated along
   the tip of the actuated plate due to its periodical motion, resulting in
   substantial heat transfer enhancement in the channel. Heat transfer is
   enhanced by 61\% by agitating operation for a representative situation.
   Translational operation of the plate induces 33\% more heat transfer
   than a corresponding flapping operation. Heat transfer on the base
   surface increases sharply as the gap distance between it and the plate
   tip decreases, while heat transfer on the fin wall surface is
   insensitive to the tip gap. Heat transfer in the channel increases
   linearly with increases of amplitude or frequency. The primary
   operational parameter to the problem is the product of amplitude and
   frequency, with amplitude being slightly more influential than
   frequency. The analysis shows that the proposed method can be used for
   modern levels of chip heat flux in an air-cooled model forestalling
   transition to liquid or phase-change cooling.}},

Abstract = {{Air-cooled heat sinks prevail in microelectronics cooling due to their
   high reliability, low cost, and simplicity. But, their heat transfer
   performance must be enhanced if they are to compete for high-flux
   applications with liquid or phase-change cooling.
   Piezoelectrically-driven agitators and synthetic jets have been reported
   as good options in enhancing heat transfer of surfaces close to them.
   This study proposes that agitators and synthetic jets be integrated
   within air-cooled heat sinks to significantly raise heat transfer
   performance.
   A proposed integrated heat sink has been investigated experimentally and
   with CFD simulations in a single channel heat sink geometry with an
   agitator and two arrays of synthetic jets. The single channel unit is a
   precursor to a full scale, multi-channel array. The agitator and the jet
   arrays are separately driven by three piezoelectric stacks at their
   individual resonant frequencies. The experiments show that the
   combination of the agitator and synthetic jets raises the heat transfer
   coefficient of the heat sink by 80\%, compared with channel flow only.
   The 3D computations show similar enhancement and agree well with the
   experiments. The numerical simulations attribute the heat transfer
   enhancement to the additional air movement generated by the oscillatory
   motion of the agitator and the pulsating flow from the synthetic jets.
   The component studies reveal that the heat transfer enhancement by the
   agitator is significant on the fin side and base surfaces and the
   synthetic jets are most effective on the fin tips.}},

   advantages, such as lower power requirement, simpler structure, and the
   ability to produce an unsteady turbulent flow which is known to be
   effective in augmenting heat transfer. This study presents experimental
   and computational results that document heat transfer coefficients
   associated with impinging a round synthetic jet flow on the tip region
   of a longitudinal fin surface used in an electronics cooling system.
   Unique to this study are the geometry of the cooled surface and the
   variations in geometry of the jet nozzle or nozzles. Also unique are
   measurements in actual-scale systems and in a scaled-up system, and
   computation. In the computation, the diaphragm movement of the synthetic
   jet is a moving wall and the flow is computed with a dynamic mesh using
   the commercial software package ANSYS FLUENT. The effects of different
   parameters, such as amplitude and frequency of diaphragm movement and
   jet-to-stagnation-line spacing, are recorded. The computational results
   show a good match with the experimental results. In the experiments, an
   actual-scale system is tested and, for finer spatial resolution and
   improved control over geometric and operational conditions, a
   large-scale mock-up is tested. The three approaches are used to
   determine heat transfer coefficients on the fin on and near the
   stagnation line. Focus is on the large scale test results and the
   computation. Application to the actual-size cases is discussed. The
   dynamically-similar mock-up matches the dimensionless Reynolds number,
   Stokes number, and Prandtl number of the actual setting with a scale
   factor of 44. A linear relationship for heat transfer coefficient versus
   frequency of diaphragm movement is shown. Heat transfer coefficient
   values as high as 650 W/m(2)K are obtained with high-frequency diaphragm
   movement. Cases with different orifice shapes show how cooling
   performance changes with orifice design.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the design of a flow control valve in which the
   area-schedule i.e., the relationship between the spool position and the
   metering orifice area, can be chosen arbitrarily. The motivation for
   such a flow controller comes from a novel hydraulic actuator intended
   for camless valve actuation in internal combustion engines. The proposed
   actuator has a unique internal feedback system in which the motion of
   the flow regulator's spool is hydro-mechanically coupled to the motion
   of the actuator Lack of direct control over the spool position
   necessitates the appropriate modification of the area-schedule in order
   to control the variation of the orifice area. The design modifications
   required to realize the area-schedules are first discussed. A systematic
   procedure which combines CFD analysis and geometry based analysis is
   then developed to characterize the variation of the effective orifice
   area for various spool designs. The proposed analysis procedure is
   validated with experimental data from a prototype spool valve. The fast
   turn around time of the proposed analysis technique is used to develop
   an automated procedure to design the 3D features on the spool required
   to realize a specified area-schedule.}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the stability of the dynamic coupling among the
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) combustion, gas exchange
   dynamics and the piston dynamics in a hydraulic free piston engine. The
   intrinsic feedback nature of the system makes the stability of the
   engine operation difficult to predict. Specifically, output from the gas
   exchange process of the previous cycle affects the combustion timing of
   the current cycle. The combustion force and hydraulic loading together
   determine how far the piston can travel (dead center positions) and
   provide input for the current cycle gas exchange process. A discrete
   cycle-to-cycle based model that captures this dynamic coupling is
   described in the paper. Linearization of the model gives us the insight
   of the engine stability under any given operation conditions. The
   stability analysis is validated with Matlab numerical simulation results
   of a high-order nonlinear model under a specified set of operation
   conditions. The proposed methodology can be transformed and applied to
   analyze stability of systems with similar dynamics couplings.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing need for clean and efficient energy conversion devices in the
   automotive sector has pushed technologies such as homogeneous charge
   compression ignition (HCCI) to the forefront of research. While it
   offers a number of major advantages in terms of efficiency and
   emissions, HCCI has significant challenges to overcome before it can be
   used in a production setting. Among those challenges is the need to
   control the start of combustion, and one method for doing that is to use
   variable valve timing to utilize hot, residual exhaust gas. Critical to
   these residual-affected methods is the role of mixing on the
   thermodynamic state. This work presents a method for validating a
   control-oriented two-zone mixing model for HCCI using CFD software. A
   method of discretizing, extracting, and analyzing the results of the CFD
   simulation is described, and it is compared with the two-zone model.
   There is strong correlation, but there is also evidence that the
   two-zone model needs to be further developed to fully capture the
   dynamics of mixing.}},

Abstract = {{The forest products industry has been greatly impacted by the Great
   Recession, with many firms reducing output or closing operations to
   remain competitive. Educational training has also been a casualty of
   cost reduction efforts by firms. Yet, we know that a well-trained
   workforce is better prepared to compete, is more innovative, and is a
   long-term competitive advantage for companies. This research looked at
   current educational needs in Minnesota and Virginia by conducting an
   electronic survey and personal interviews with management personnel in
   the forest products industry. A key finding was that the factors that
   have impacted firms since the start of the recession (2008) were similar
   between states and included the housing market, transportation costs,
   energy costs, and changing customer demand. Results by size of firm and
   type of firm varied significantly, and training needs differed by state
   and size and type of firm. The identified training needs included
   quality/process control, process improvement, marketing, sales,
   motivating personnel, and total quality management. Firms rated personal
   visits and short courses as the primary methods of providing training.
   During the in-person interviews, managers were asked about the reasons
   for their companies' success during the recession. In Virginia, they
   felt that being customer focused, flexible, and diversified and having
   good financial management were the key issues. In Minnesota, they
   believed having high-quality products and good customer relationships,
   being ``lean,{''} controlling costs, and being flexible were their
   success factors.}},

   Robust Sparse Hashing (RSH). Our approach is inspired by the success of
   dictionary learning for sparse coding; the key innovation is to use
   learned sparse codes as hashcodes for speeding up NN. But sparse coding
   suffers from a major drawback: when data are noisy or uncertain, for a
   query point, an exact match of the hashcode seldom happens, breaking the
   NN retrieval. We tackle this difficulty via our novel dictionary
   learning and sparse coding framework called RSH by learning dictionaries
   on the robustified counterparts of uncertain data points. The algorithm
   is applied to NN retrieval for Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT)
   descriptors. The results demonstrate that RSH is noise tolerant, and at
   the same time shows promising NN performance over the state-of-the-art.}},

   3DOM cerium oxide, with a specific surface area of 25 m(2) g(-1),
   increases the average H-2 and CO production rates over the non-ordered
   porous cerium oxide with a specific surface area of 112 m(2) g(-1): the
   average H-2 production rate increases from 5.2 cm(3) g(-1) min(-1) to
   7.9 cm(3) g(-1) min(-1) and the average CO production rate increases
   from 7.7 cm(3) g(-1) min(-1) to 21.9 cm(3) g(-1) min(-1). The superior
   reactivity of 3DOM cerium oxide is attributed primarily to the stability
   of the 3DOM structure and also to the improved transport of reacting
   species to and from oxidation sites realized with the interconnected and
   ordered pores of the 3DOM structure. Doping the 3DOM cerium oxide with
   20 mol\% zirconia further stabilizes the structure and increases the
   average H-2 and CO production rates to 10.2 cm(3) g(-1) min(-1) and 22.1
   cm(3) g(-1) min(-1), respectively.}},

Abstract = {{The use of concentrated solar energy for gasification of biomass is an
   efficient means for production of hydrogen rich synthesis gas. Utilizing
   molten alkali-carbonate salts as a reaction and heat transfer medium
   offers enhanced heat transfer, faster kinetics, and stability for solar
   transients. The effect of the molten salts on gasification of
   switchgrass is examined in terms of the reaction rates and product
   composition. Experiments were carried out in an electrically heated
   molten salt reactor. Switchgrass was gasified with steam at 1200 K in an
   inert gas and with salt. Reactivity indexes were calculated from
   measured gas production rates. Product composition was established via
   mass spectrometry. In salt, the total useful syngas production increased
   by 30\% while reducing net carbon dioxide production. Reactivity
   increased 81\%. Secondary products, in the form of condensable tar and
   unreacted char, were reduced by 77\%.}},

Abstract = {{A passivity framework for hydraulic actuators is developed by
   consideration of the compressibility energy function for a fluid with a
   pressure dependent bulk modulus. The typical actuator's mechanical and
   pressure dynamic model is shown to be the Euler-Lagrange equations for
   this energy function. A passivity property for the actuator is exhibited
   in which the hydraulic supply rate contains the compressibility energy,
   instead of just being P. Q. A storage function for the pressure error is
   then proposed based on the physical compressibility energy and the
   pressure error dynamics is shown to be a passive two-port subsystem.
   Control laws are derived using the storage function. A case study is
   presented to compare the new passivity based approach and the
   traditional backstepping approach for a trajectory tracking application.
   In this example, the proposed approach is less sensitive to velocity
   measurement error and requires lower feedback gains than the traditional
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a comparative study of two possible power-generating
   units for the free-piston engine (FPE): Permanent-magnet linear
   alternator (PMLA) and linear hydraulic pump. The FPE discussed in this
   paper is a linear opposed-piston, opposed-cylinder (OPOC) engine that
   operates with a homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI)
   combustion. Lack of crankshaft in the FPE allows lower friction loss,
   variable compression ratio, and higher modularity compared to a
   conventional engine. Also the OPOC configuration enables high-frequency
   operation of the FPE, which results in high power density. The FPE is
   also well suited for HCCI operation, which offers improved fuel
   efficiency and emissions. The chemical power released in the combustion
   chambers can be transformed to fluid or electric power This could be
   done via a hydraulic pump or a linear alternator In this paper these two
   systems are studied and compared as the power-generating device for the
   FPE.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the pressure-volume trajectories that yield the
   optimal tradeoff between efficiency and power during the compression and
   expansion of air. These results could benefit applications such as
   compressed air energy storage where both high efficiency and power
   density are required. Earlier work established solutions for the simple
   case in which hA, the product of the heat transfer coefficient and heat
   transfer surface area, is constant. This paper extends that analysis by
   allowing hA to vary with air volume. Solutions to the constrained,
   non-linear optimization problem are developed utilizing the method of
   Lagrange multipliers and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. It is
   found that the optimal trajectory takes the form ``fast-slow-fast{''}
   where the fast stages are adiabatic and the temperature change during
   the slow stage is proportional to the inverse root of the hA product. A
   case study predicts a 60\% improvement in power over the constant-hA
   solution when both trajectories are run at 90\% efficiency and hA = hA
   (V). Compared to linear- and sinusoidal-shaped trajectories, also at
   90\% efficiency, power gains are expected to be in the range of
   500-1500\%.}},

Abstract = {{The application of switched mode control to hydraulic systems has the
   potential of decreasing component complexity, size, and cost. This is
   accomplished by enabling variable pump or motor functionality using a
   single on/off valve paired with a compact, inexpensive fixed
   displacement machine. A 4-way tandem rotary on/off valve is presented in
   this paper that extends a novel rotary valve concept (experimentally
   validated for pump applications) to hydraulic pump/motors. The
   pump/valve system is referred to as a Virtually Variable Displacement
   Pump/Motor (VVDPM) since the effective displacement of the system is
   variable and not the physical displacement of the pump itself. This
   paper investigates the design and efficiency of the proposed rotary
   valve when utilizing the VVDPM on a light weight power-split hydraulic
   hybrid passenger vehicle that is driven over a standard federal drive
   cycle. Simulated VVDPM efficiency maps are presented for motoring and
   pumping and the cycle efficiency of an optimized VVDPM is compared to
   that of a typical bent axis unit. Vehicle fuel economy is also explored
   through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Ultra-thin superhydrophilic titanium oxide films were fabricated on
   silicon microchannels by an in situ reaction sol-gel method using
   titanium tetraisopropoxide as a starting material.. By changing the
   concentration of water in ethanol and reaction time, the thickness of
   synthesized TiO2 films can be controlled from around 10 nm to 80 nm. The
   contact angle of as-synthesized TiO2 films on flat silicon is around 20
   degrees and can be further decreased to zero by calcination at 700
   degrees C in nitrogen atmosphere. X-ray diffraction spectra show the
   microstructure of the TiO2 films changed gradually from amorphous to
   anatase with the increase of calcination temperature. Surface morphology
   of the film before and after calcination also shows that a smoother
   coating with crystal structure was obtained by heat treatment.
   The flow velocity in the TiO2 coated channel reached around 0.03 m/s,
   almost ten times of that in PDDA/PSS coated channel and 4 times of that
   in SiO2 coated one. The ultra-thin superhydrophilic TiO2 films
   fabricated by this method show the ability to strongly increase the
   wettability of microchannels without affecting the morphology of the
   sidewall of the channels, indicating potential applications to
   biomolecule analysis and surface tension driven microfluidic systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports numerical studies of steady two-dimensional natural
   convection in fluid-superposed porous layers heated locally from below.
   The numerical simulation is based on the Darcy-Brinkman-Forchheimer
   model for the porous layer and focuses on the parametric domain in which
   the flow is well established, i.e., the overall Rayleigh number is
   several orders of magnitude larger than the critical value. An emphasis
   is placed on revealing the effects of two dimensionless parameters on
   the overall Nusselt number: the porous layer-to-cavity height ratio (eta
   = H-m/H) and the heater-to-cavity base length ratio (delta = L-H/L).
   Calculations cover eta = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 5 = 0.25, 0.5, 1, and overall
   Rayleigh numbers from 10(3) to 10(6). For a fixed height ratio, overall
   Nusselt numbers increase with a decrease in the heater length. For a
   given heater length ratio, overall Nusselt number increases with an
   increase in the height of the overlying fluid layer. Recirculating flow
   is confined primarily to the overlying fluid layer with some penetration
   into the upper part of the porous layer. The present results represent
   an extension of the well studied problem of buoyant convection in
   superposed layers with a fully heated lower surface.}},

Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING}},

Abstract = {{We consider the multiuser beamforming problem for a multi-input
   single-output downlink channel that takes into account the errors in the
   channel state information at the transmitter side (CSIT). By modeling
   the CSIT errors as elliptically bounded uncertainty regions, this
   problem can be formulated as minimizing the transmission power subject
   to the worst-case signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio constraints.
   Several methods have been proposed to solve this nonconvex optimization
   problem, but none can guarantee a global optimal solution. In this
   article, we consider a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) for this multiuser
   beamforming problem, and prove that the SDR method actually solves the
   robust beamforming problem to global optimality as long as the channel
   uncertainty bound is sufficiently small or when the transmitter is
   equipped with at most two antennas. Numerical examples show that the
   proposed SDR approach significantly outperforms the existing methods in
   terms of the average required power consumption at the transmitter.}},

Abstract = {{We present a label-free detection of swine influenza virus (STY) H1N1 by
   means of the excellent electrical properties of single-walled carbon
   nanotubes (SWCNTs). The electrical resistance of SWCNT resistor tends to
   increase upon the surface adsorption of macromolecules such as
   poly-L-lysine, anti-SIV antibodies, and SIVs in the process of
   immunoassay. The SWCNT network resistor was successfully able to detect
   as low as 180 TCID50/ml of SIV using the resistance shifts upon
   immunobinding of SIVs. The sensor specificity was demonstrated against
   transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and feline calicivirus (FCV).
   This facile CNT-based immnoassay has potential applications as a rapid
   point-of-care detection or a sensing platform for lab-on-a-chip systems.}},

Abstract = {{Heat (mass) transfer experiments are conducted to study the effect of an
   inlet skew on a simulated gas-turbine blade placed in a linear cascade.
   The inlet skew simulates the relative motion between rotor and stator
   endwalls in a single turbine stage. The transverse motion of a belt,
   placed parallel to and upstream of the turbine cascade, generates the
   inlet skew With the freestream velocity constant at approximately 16
   m/sec, which results in a Reynolds number (based on the blade chord
   length of 0.184 m) of 1.8 x 10(5), a parametric study was conducted for
   three belt-to-freestream velocity ratios. The distribution of the
   Sherwood number on the suction surface of the blade shows that the inlet
   skew intensifies the generation of the horseshoe vortex close to the
   endwall region. This is associated with the development of a stronger
   passage vortex for a higher velocity ratio, which causes an earlier
   transition to turbulence. Corresponding higher mass transfer
   coefficients are measured between the mid-height of the blade and the
   endwall, at a mid-chord downstream location. However, a negligible
   variation in transport properties is measured above the two-dimensional
   region of the blade at the higher velocity ratios. In contrast, the
   inlet skew has a negligible effect on the distribution of the Sherwood
   number on the entire pressure surface of the blade. This is mainly
   because the skew is directed along the passage vortex, which is from the
   pressure surface of the airfoil to the suction surface of the adjacent
   airfoil.}},

   data exploration and analysis. While previous work has focused on
   indexing progressively larger datasets and has proposed data structures
   with efficient exact search algorithms, we motivate the need for
   approximate query methods that can be used in interactive exploration
   and as fast data analysis subroutines on large spatiotemporal datasets.
   We formulate a simple approximate range query problem for time series
   data, and propose a method that aims to quickly access a small number of
   high quality results of the exact search resultset. We propose an
   evaluation strategy on the query framework when the false dismissal
   class is very large relative to the query resultset, and investigate the
   performance of indexing novel classes of time series subsequences.}},

   circuits. If the functionality equivalence cannot be easily verified,

   of high-level transformations to hide the functionalities of DSP
   circuits, which include retiming, pipelining, folding, unfolding, and
   interleaving. We show that we can design circuits which are harder to
   reverse engineer by adopting high-level transformations. However, other
   techniques, such as modifying the switch instances, adding dummy loops,
   and manipulating inputs, can also be exploited for both verifying
   equivalence as well as designing secure circuits.}},

   transmission in a heterogeneous network with densely deployed base
   stations. The objective is to design downlink transmit strategies in a
   way that optimizes the system spectrum efficiency while using small size

   propose a sparse optimization approach for this problem, by utilizing
   the fact that having small cluster sizes is equivalent to imposing a
   certain group sparsity structure on the precoders of the base stations.
   Specifically, our formulation is based on the maximization of a
   penalized system utility function, with the penalization term chosen to
   induce the desired sparsity pattern. We then propose two algorithms to
   solve this problem and demonstrate their effectiveness via numerical

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel two-stage system that detects diabetic
   retinopathy (DR) using fundus photographs. The first-stage of this
   system masks out the background consisting of the optic disc, using a
   novel Minimum Intensity Maximum Solidity (MinIMaS) overlap algorithm
   that is 99.7\% accurate in segmenting the optic disc region on public
   data sets named DIARETDB0, DIARETDB1, DRIVE, and STARE. Receiver
   operating characteristic (ROC) analysis on the DIARETDB1 data set
   depicts that the second-stage of the system classifies bright lesions
   with 82.87\% sensitivity, 94.36\% specificity, 0.9593 area under ROC
   curves (AUC), and it detects red lesions with 75.5\% sensitivity,
   93.73\% specificity, 0.8663 AUC using the Gaussian Mixture Models. Also,
   for DIARETDB1, free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC)
   analysis shows that the proposed detection system achieves a sensitivity
   of 80\% for bright lesion detection, and 64\% for red lesion detection
   at 0.5 false positives per image. Thus, the proposed DR detection system
   outperforms existing works by lowering false positives in lesion
   classification, and hence it can be applied to enhance the effectiveness
   in screening patients for diabetic retinopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Multicast beamforming exploits subscriber channel state information at
   the base station to form multiple beams that steer radiated power
   towards users of interest, while minimizing leakage to other users and
   systems. Such functionality has been provisioned in the long-term
   evolution (LTE) enhanced multimedia broadcast multicast service (EMBMS).
   In this context, the present paper deals with joint multicast
   beamforming and antenna selection. Whereas this problem (and even plain
   multicast beamforming) is NP-hard, it is shown that using l(1)-norm
   squared (instead of l(1)-norm) as a surrogate for the l(0)-norm yields a
   natural semidefinite programming relaxation - something not obvious with
   the l(1)-norm. Simulations indicate that the proposed algorithm
   significantly reduces the number of antennas required to meet prescribed
   service levels, at a relatively small cost of excess transmission power.
   Furthermore, its performance is close to that attained by exhaustive
   search, at far lower complexity.}},

Abstract = {{A scalable test structure for recovery free evaluation of the impact of
   NBTI and PBTI on read/write operation in a SRAM macro has been
   developed. A novel non-invasive methodology keeps the stress interrupts
   for measurements within a few microseconds, preventing unwanted BTI
   recovery, while providing a parallel stress-measure capability on 32kb
   sub-arrays. Measurement results in a 32nm high-kappa/metal-gate
   silicon-on-insulator process show that proposed schemes provides 35mV
   better accuracy in read V-MIN and 10X accuracy in BFR.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, DNA microarrays have fundamentally changed the way
   we study complex biological systems. By measuring the expression levels
   of thousands of transcripts, the paradigm of studying organisms has
   shifted from focusing on the local phenomena of a few genes to surveying
   the whole genome. DNA microarrays are used in a variety of ways, from
   simple comparisons between two samples to more intricate time-series
   studies. With the large number of genes being studied, the
   dimensionality of the problem is inevitably high. The analysis of
   microarray data thus requires specific approaches. In the case of
   time-series microarray studies, data analysis is further complicated by
   the correlation between successive time points in a series.
   In this review, we survey the methodologies used in the analysis of
   static and time-series microarray data, covering data pre-processing,
   identification of differentially expressed genes, profile pattern
   recognition, pathway analysis, and network reconstruction. When
   available, examples of their use in mammalian cell cultures are
   presented.}},

Abstract = {{A conventional matrix converter (CMC) is a direct acac converter without
   the need for a DC bus. This paper proposes a direct three level matrix
   converter (DTMC) topology which is advancement to the CMC in terms of
   considerable reduction in THD and lower switching stresses. As opposed
   to CMC which allows the output line voltage to be either input line
   voltage or zero, the DTMC provides an extra level - the input phase
   voltage, to be available by tapping into input filter neutral. A novel
   constant pulse width modulation (CPWM) strategy is proposed for the DTMC
   by decoupling it into a fictitious multi level converter and a
   conventional inverter. A comparative study between CMC and DTMC has been
   presented by means of numerical simulation results that have been
   verified on a laboratory hardware prototype.}},

Abstract = {{The use of concentrated solar energy for pyrolysis and gasification of
   biomass is an efficient means for production of hydrogen rich synthesis
   gas. Utilizing molten alkali-carbonate salts as a reaction and heat
   transfer media offers enhanced stability and higher reaction rates to
   these solar processes. To establish the reaction kinetics, experiments
   were carried out in an electrically heated molten salt reactor.
   Cellulose or activated charcoal were pyrolyzed or gasified with steam
   from 1124 K to 1235 K with and without salt. Arrhenius rate expressions
   are derived from the data supported by a numerical model of heat and
   mass transfer. The average rate of the reactions in molten salt, as
   measured by their reactivity index, is increased by 70\% for pyrolysis
   and by an order of magnitude for steam gasification.}},

   by a Monte Carlo ray tracing analysis to achieve multiple design
   objectives, including high transfer efficiency of radiation from the
   lamps to the common focal plane and desired flux distribution. Based on
   the numerical results, the final optimized design will deliver 7.5 kW
   over a 6-cm diameter circular disc located in the focal plane, with a

Pages = {{105-110}},
Abstract = {{De lamination that occurs because of layer debonding or stripping
   between layers of hot-mix asphalt can cause distresses such as
   longitudinal cracking in the wheelpath and tearing in the surface.
   Because these distresses cannot be detected by visual inspection of the
   pavement, highway agencies are interested in finding nondestructive
   methods for detecting delamination to maintain roadway networks. A study
   evaluated an ultrasonic tomography device for detecting the type and
   severity of delamination with various focusing techniques. A comparison
   of blind ultrasonic tomography testing results versus construction of
   bonded and debonded conditions showed that ultrasonic tomography could
   detect delamination between new and old asphalt layers, as well as
   delamination of lifts within new asphalt pavement. B- and D-scan methods
   with the focusing technique of synthetic aperture were able to identify
   delamination between new and old asphalt interfaces, and a new focusing
   method developed at the University of Minnesota was used to identify
   delamination within asphalt lifts.}},

   improvement of existing processes and products with an emphasis on
   eliminating any and all wastes in the system, applying lean to an
   organization often implies difficulties in promoting innovations that
   involve high risks and dramatic changes. In this article, we investigate
   the impact of lean design practices on an organization's radical
   innovation capability through a survey study. Results suggest that the
   stressed importance of standardization in lean design has a negative
   effect on an organization's radical innovation capability. A negative
   correlation between the emphasis of ``design being compatible with
   existing manufacturing process{''} and the organization's radical
   innovation capability is also suggested. Part integration, on the other
   hand, positively contributes to an organization's radical innovation
   capability.}},

Abstract = {{One of the chief challenges of wearable sensing is adapting electronic
   components and sensors to the wearable environment. Electronic
   components are often rigid, bulky, and impermeable: factors that usually
   detract from wearing comfort. Here, we present a novel stretch sensor
   fabricated using the top thread of a standard industrial coverstitch
   machine. The machine is common in apparel production and offers the
   ability to easily fabricate custom-placed stretch sensors on textile and
   apparel products. The sensing properties of the stitch are enabled by a
   conductive thread which increases its electric resistance as the fabric
   is stretched, due to the geometry of the stitches. Our empirical
   analysis shows a sensor response in the order of 10 ohms, with almost
   linear behavior prior to saturation (when the stitch is fully stretched)
   for low-frequency extensions of 119\% of initial sample length. An
   equivalent electrical model is presented for theoretical modeling of the

Abstract = {{Early intervention in mental disorders can dramatically increase an
   individual's quality of life. Additionally, when symptoms of mental
   illness appear in childhood or adolescence, they represent the later
   stages of a process that began years earlier. One goal of psychiatric
   research is to identify risk-markers: genetic, neural, behavioral and/or
   social deviations that indicate elevated risk of a particular mental
   disorder. Ideally, screening of risk-markers should occur in a community
   setting, and not a clinical setting which may be time-consuming and
   resource-intensive. Given this situation, a system for automatically
   detecting risk-markers in children would be highly valuable. In this
   paper, we describe such a system that has been installed at the Shirley
   G. Moore Lab School, a research pre-school at the University of
   Minnesota. This system consists of multiple RGB+D sensors and is able to
   detect children and adults in the classroom, tracking them as they move
   around the room. We use the tracking results to extract high-level
   information about the behavior and social interaction of children, that
   can then be used to screen for early signs of mental disorders.}},

   Comparison results have shown that for the code of the 64-ary (1260,
   630) rate-0.5 Class-I code, the proposed scheme can save more than
   70.6\% hardware required by shuffle network than the state-of-the-art
   designs. The proposed decoder example for the 32-ary (992, 496) rate-0.5
   Class-II code can achieve a 93.8\% shuffle network reduction compared
   with the conventional ones. Meanwhile, based on the similarity of
   Class-I and Class-II codes, similar shuffle network is further developed
   to incorporate both classes of codes at a very low cost.}},

Abstract = {{In taxicab industry, a long standing challenge is how to reduce
   taxicab's mileage spent without a fare, i.e., cruising mile. The current
   solution for this challenge usually requires the participation of the
   passengers. To solve the issue without the passengers involved, in this
   paper, we propose a cruising system, pCruise, for taxicab drivers to
   maximize theirs profits by finding the optimal route to pick up a
   passenger, thus reducing the cruising mile. In pCruise, base on
   collected GPS records about other near taxicabs, a taxicab characterizes
   its cruising process with a cruising graph. When a taxicab becomes
   vacant and tries to find a passenger, cruising graph will provide the
   shortest cruising route with at least one expected available passengers
   for this taxicab. With the shortest cruising routes, taxicabs will
   significantly reduce theirs cruising miles. We evaluate pCruise based on
   a 7 days 10 GB real world GPS dataset from a city with more than 15, 000
   taxicabs. The evaluation results show that pCruise can assist taxicab
   drivers to reduce cruising miles by 41\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{Detecting DNA copy number variations (CNVs) from arrayCGH or
   genotyping-array data to correlate with cancer outcomes is crucial for
   understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cancer. Previous
   methods either focus on detecting CNVs in each individual patient sample
   or common CNVs across all the patient samples. These methods ignore the
   discrepancies introduced by the heterogeneity in the patient samples,
   which implies that common CNVs might only be shared within some groups
   of samples instead of all samples. In this paper, we propose a latent
   feature model that couples sparse sample group selection with fused
   lasso on CNV components to identify group-specific CNVs. Assuming a
   given group structure on patient samples by clinical information, sparse
   group selection on fused lasso (SGS-FL) identifies the optimal latent
   CNV components, each of which is specific to the samples in one or
   several groups. The group selection for each CNV component is determined
   dynamically by an adaptive algorithm to achieve a desired sparsity.
   Simulation results show that SGS-FL can more accurately identify the
   latent CNV components when there is a reliable underlying group
   structure in the samples. In the experiments on arrayCGH breast cancer
   and bladder cancer datasets, SGS-FL detected CNV regions that are more
   relevant to cancer, and provided latent feature weights that can be used
   for better sample classification.}},

Abstract = {{Computation performed on stochastic bit streams is less efficient than
   that based on a binary radix because of its long latency. However, for
   certain complex arithmetic operations, computation on stochastic bit
   streams can consume less energy and tolerate more soft errors. In
   addition, the latency issue could be solved by using a faster clock
   frequency or in combination with a parallel processing approach. To take
   advantage of this computing technique, previous work proposed a
   combinational logic-based reconfigurable architecture to perform complex
   arithmetic operations on stochastic streams of bits. In this paper, we
   enhance and extend this reconfigurable architecture using sequential
   logic. Compared to the previous approach, the proposed reconfigurable
   architecture takes less hardware area and consumes less energy, while
   achieving the same performance in terms of processing time and
   fault-tolerance.}},

   proposed fault model, we conduct extensive experiments on real PCM
   devices at the memory module level. Numerical results uncover many
   interesting trends in terms of the lifetime of PCM devices and error
   behaviors. Specifically, PCM lifetime for the memory chips we tested is
   greater than 14 million cycles, which is much longer than for flash
   memory devices. In addition, the distributions for four types of errors
   are quite different. These results can be used for estimating PCM
   lifetime and for measuring the fabrication quality of individual PCM

Abstract = {{In 3D ICs, TSV-induced thermal residual stress impacts transistor
   mobilities due to the piezoresistive effect. This phenomenon is coupled
   with other temperature effects on transistor parameters that are seen

   developed to holistically represent the effect of thermally-induced

Abstract = {{The paradigm of logical computation on stochastic bit streams has
   several key advantages compared to deterministic computation based on
   binary radix, including error-tolerance and low hardware area cost.
   Prior research has shown that sequential logic operating on stochastic
   bit streams can compute non-polynomial functions, such as the tanh
   function, with less energy than conventional implementations. However,
   the functions that can be computed in this way are quite limited. For
   example, high order polynomials and non-polynomial functions cannot be
   computed using prior approaches. This paper proposes a new finite-state
   machine (FSM) topology for complex arithmetic computation on stochastic
   bit streams. It describes a general methodology for synthesizing such
   FSMs. Experimental results show that these FSM-based implementations are
   more tolerant of soft errors and less costly in terms of the area-time
   product that conventional implementations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the architecture, functionality, and field
   demonstration results of a newly developed dedicated short-range
   communication based vehicle-to-infrastructure work zone traffic
   information system with vehicle-to-vehicle assistance. The new system is
   portable and can automatically acquire important work zone travel
   information such as the travel time and the starting location of
   congestion and then relay this information to drivers approaching the
   congestion site. Such information can help drivers make informed
   decisions on route choice, prepare for upcoming congestion, or both. The
   authors had designed a similar system earlier; that system had limited
   congestion coverage and message broadcast ranges, but the new system can
   achieve a much longer broadcast range (up to a few tens of kilometers)
   and can handle much longer congestion coverage (up to a few kilometers)
   by incorporating vehicle-to-infrastructure communication assisted by
   vehicle-to-vehicle communication. The system requires only a single
   roadside unit to acquire traffic data by engaging the vehicles traveling
   on the road whether within or outside of its direct wireless access
   range. From the traffic data, the system estimates important traffic
   parameters such as travel time and starting location of congestion and
   periodically broadcasts this information back to the vehicles
   approaching the congestion well before they enter the congested area.
   The results from the field demonstration show that the new system can
   adapt to a dynamically changing work zone traffic environment and can
   handle much longer congestion lengths as compared with the previous
   system, which used only vehicle-to-infrastructure communication without
   vehicle-to-vehicle assistance.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the economic feasibility of a distributed
   network of biodiesel production facilities installed in Greater London
   area of the UK, in order to take advantage of the availability of waste
   cooking oil, concentrated demand for biodiesel and economies of
   ``mass{''} produced capital equipment. The biodiesel facility location
   problem was formulated as a mixed integer linear program (MILP) with the
   objective to maximize system-wide net present value. Total capital
   investment was described as a function of installed capacity using a
   general piecewise linear function, allowing for the effect of capital
   cost reductions of mass produced capital to be addressed. This system of
   small scale distributed biodiesel production is shown to be economically
   feasible and could be seen as a possible step towards a more locally
   focused fuels and energy supply network.}},

Title = {{Conserved rules govern genetic interaction degree across species}},
Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Synthetic genetic interactions have recently been mapped on
   a genome scale in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing
   a functional view of the central processes of eukaryotic life.
   Currently, comprehensive genetic interaction networks have not been
   determined for other species, and we therefore sought to model conserved
   aspects of genetic interaction networks in order to enable the transfer
   of knowledge between species.
   Results: Using a combination of physiological and evolutionary
   properties of genes, we built models that successfully predicted the
   genetic interaction degree of S. cerevisiae genes. Importantly, a model
   trained on S. cerevisiae gene features and degree also accurately
   predicted interaction degree in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces
   pombe, suggesting that many of the predictive relationships discovered
   in S. cerevisiae also hold in this evolutionarily distant yeast. In both
   species, high single mutant fitness defect, protein disorder,
   pleiotropy, protein-protein interaction network degree, and low
   expression variation were significantly predictive of genetic
   interaction degree. A comparison of the predicted genetic interaction
   degrees of S. pombe genes to the degrees of S. cerevisiae orthologs
   revealed functional rewiring of specific biological processes that
   distinguish these two species. Finally, predicted differences in genetic
   interaction degree were independently supported by differences in
   co-expression relationships of the two species.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that there are common relationships
   between gene properties and genetic interaction network topology in two
   evolutionarily distant species. This conservation allows use of the
   extensively mapped S. cerevisiae genetic interaction network as an
   orthology-independent reference to guide the study of more complex
   species.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional ``chalk and talk{''} teaching in civil engineering is
   gradually being replaced with active learning that focuses on
   encouraging students to discover knowledge with innovative pedagogical
   methods and tools. One interesting such tool is the board game. This
   research examines the efficacy of adopting transportation board games as
   a tool in graduate-level transportation planning and transportation
   economics classes at the University of Minnesota from 2008 to 2011. The
   Department of Civil Engineering offered these courses with
   transportation board games on weekday nights. Students were asked to
   evaluate the effects of the games on their learning and to write
   self-reflective essays about their findings. The postgame survey
   revealed that the students' understanding of the planning process,
   network deployment, and practical issues, and their ability to form
   opinions about transportation planning had improved. Student essays on
   the game economy and its implications on planning further validated that
   the learning outcomes derived from this game process met the pedagogical
   goals. This analysis shows that students who are oriented toward
   learning more on the basis of the visual, sensing, active, or sequential
   learning styles, with all else being equal, tend to learn more
   effectively through this approach than those who do not share these
   learning styles. Overall, this research suggests that properly
   incorporating board games into the curriculum can enhance students'
   learning in transportation planning.}},

Abstract = {{The early detection of developmental disorders is key to child outcome,
   allowing interventions to be initiated that promote development and
   improve prognosis. Research on autism spectrum disorder (ASD) suggests
   behavioral markers can be observed late in the first year of life. Many
   of these studies involved extensive frame-by-frame video observation and
   analysis of a child's natural behavior. Although non-intrusive, these
   methods are extremely time-intensive and require a high level of
   observer training; thus, they are impractical for clinical purposes.
   Diagnostic measures for ASD are available for infants but are only
   accurate when used by specialists experienced in early diagnosis. This
   work is a first milestone in a long-term multidisciplinary project that
   aims at helping clinicians and general practitioners accomplish this
   early detection/measurement task automatically. We focus on providing
   computer vision tools to measure and identify ASD behavioral markers
   based on components of the Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI).
   In particular, we develop algorithms to measure three critical AOSI
   activities that assess visual attention. We augment these AOSI
   activities with an additional test that analyzes asymmetrical patterns
   in unsupported gait. The first set of algorithms involves assessing head
   motion by facial feature tracking, while the gait analysis relies on
   joint foreground segmentation and 2D body pose estimation in video. We
   show results that provide insightful knowledge to augment the
   clinician's behavioral observations obtained from real in-clinic
   assessments.}},

   spectral information improves the classification and visualization
   quality of hyperspectral imagery. These studies normally make use of
   spatial neighborhoods of hyperspectral pixels for extracting these
   geometric features. In this work, we merge point cloud Light Detection
   and Ranging (LiDAR) data and hyperspectral imagery (HSI) into a single
   sparse modeling pipeline for subpixel mapping and classification. The
   model accounts for material variability and noise by using learned
   dictionaries that act as spectral endmembers. Additionally, the
   estimated abundances are influenced by the LiDAR point cloud density,
   particularly helpful in spectral mixtures involving partial occlusions
   and illumination changes caused by elevation differences. We demonstrate
   the advantages of the proposed algorithm with co-registered LiDAR-HSI
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Modifications made to the Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide
   (MEPDG) to accommodate the design of a newly constructed composite
   pavement system featuring a thin portland cement concrete (PCC) layer
   placed over another PCC layer (PCC PCC pavement) are described. In
   previous versions of the MEPDG, a newly constructed PCC PCC pavement
   project was considered a bonded PCC overlay of an existing PCC pavement.
   As a result of this simplification, the MEPDG was not consistent in its
   predictions for a newly constructed PCC PCC pavement and its
   structurally equivalent single-layer analogue. To remedy this
   inconsistency, researchers suggested modifications to the Enhanced
   Integrated Climatic Model (EICM) used by the MEPDG in terms of (a)
   number of locations through the slab used by EICM to determine the
   thermal gradient and (b)EICM calculation of the subgrade spring
   stiffness (or k-value). Before-and-after MEPDG sensitivity analyses are
   included to justify the modifications developed and implemented into the
   MEPDG with the assistance of the MEPDG development team. This research

Abstract = {{An important issue in extending the life of jointed plain concrete
   pavement is the proper construction and maintenance of transverse
   joints. The capabilities of an ultrasonic tomography device in providing
   information essential to joint rehabilitation decisions as well as the
   quality control of rehabilitation construction are presented. Testing
   was conducted at various partial-depth repair locations of a recently
   repaired in-service highway to determine the presence and extent of
   debonding between the partial-depth repair and the existing concrete.
   Testing also was conducted at the Minnesota Road Research Facility to
   evaluate the subsurface condition along various transverse joints.
   Real-time diagnosis with the intensity-based signals of the synthetic
   aperture focusing technique was successful in pinpointing the location
   of debonded concrete interfaces within partial-depth repairs. Ultrasonic
   tomography testing also showed the capability of identifying that a
   joint is in need of repair and subsequently diagnosing the extent of
   subsurface deterioration throughout the joint.}},

Abstract = {{A deterministic, process-oriented, dynamic and one-dimensional
   year-round lake water quality model, MINLAKE2010, was developed for
   water temperature (T) and dissolved oxygen (DO) simulations to study
   impacts of climate warming on lake water quality and cisco fish habitat.
   The DO model is able to simulate metalimnetic oxygen maxima in vertical
   DO profiles of oligotrophic lakes. The model was calibrated with profile
   data from the 28 study lakes in Minnesota; two-thirds of them are deep
   mesotrophic/oligotrophic lakes that support cisco, a coldwater fish
   species. The average standard error of estimate against measured data
   was 1.47 degrees C for T and 1.50 mg/L for DO. Oxythermal habitat
   parameter TDO3 (T at DO 3 mg/L) was determined from simulated daily T
   and DO profiles under past and future climate scenarios in the 28 study
   lakes. Average annual maximum TDO3 (TDO3(AM)) for the 28 study lakes is
   projected to increase on the average of 3.2 degrees C under the MIROC
   3.2 future scenario, while the occurrence day of TDO3(AM) is not much
   different under past and future climate scenarios. Both physical
   processes (mixing characteristics related to lake geometry ratio) and
   trophic status control temperature and DO characteristics and then
   affect cisco habitat in a lake.}},

Abstract = {{In testing, the test oracle is the artifact that determines whether an
   application under test executes correctly. The choice of test oracle can
   significantly impact the effectiveness of the testing process. However,
   despite the prevalence of tools that support the selection of test
   inputs, little work exists for supporting oracle creation.
   In this work, we propose a method of supporting test oracle creation.
   This method automatically selects the oracle data-the set of variables
   monitored during testing-for expected value test oracles. This approach
   is based on the use of mutation analysis to rank variables in terms of
   fault-finding effectiveness, thus automating the selection of the oracle
   data. Experiments over four industrial examples demonstrate that our
   method may be a cost-effective approach for producing small, effective
   oracle data, with fault finding improvements over current industrial
   best practice of up to 145.8\% observed.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of tracking white matter fibers in high angular
   resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI) data while simultaneously
   estimating the local fiber orientation profile. Prior work showed that
   an unscented Kalman filter (UKF) can be used for this problem, yet
   existing algorithms employ parametric mixture models to represent water
   diffusion and to define the state space. To address this restrictive
   model dependency, we propose to extend the UKF to HARDI data modeled by
   orientation distribution functions (ODFs), a more generic diffusion
   model. We consider the spherical harmonic representation of the HARDI
   signal as the state, enforce nonnegativity of the ODFs, and perform
   tractography using the directions at which the ODFs attain their peaks.
   In simulations, our method outperforms filtered two-tensor tractography
   at different levels of noise by achieving a reduction in mean Chamfer
   error of 0.05 to 0.27 voxels; it also produced in vivo fiber tracking
   that is consistent with the neuroanatomy.}},

Abstract = {{Accidental electrocutions kill about 1000 individuals annually in the
   USA alone. There has not been a systematic review or modeling of elapsed
   time duration defibrillation success rates following
   electrically-induced VF. With such a model, there may be an opportunity
   to improve the outcomes for industrial electrocutions and further
   understand arrest-related-deaths where a TASER (R) electrical weapon was
   involved. We searched for MedLine indexed papers dealing with
   defibrillation success following electrically-induced VF with time
   durations of 1 minute or greater post VF induction. We found 10 studies
   covering a total of 191 experiments for defibrillation of
   electrically-induced VF for post-induction durations out to 16 minutes
   including 0-9 minutes of pre-shock chest compressions.
   The results were fitted to a logistic regression model. Total minutes of
   VF and use of pre-shock chest compressions were significant predictors
   of success (p < .00005 and p = .003 respectively). The number of minutes
   of chest compressions was not a predictor of success. With no
   compressions, the 90\% confidence of successful defibrillation is
   reached at 6 minutes and the median time limit for success is 9.5
   minutes. However, with pre-shock chest compressions, the modeled data
   suggest a 90\% success rate at 10 minutes and a 50\% rate at 14 minutes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel low-complexity patient-specific algorithm
   for seizure prediction. Adaboost algorithm is used in two stages of the
   algorithm: feature selection and classification. The algorithm extracts
   spectral power features in 9 different sub-bands from the
   electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. We have proposed a new feature
   ranking method to rank the features. The key (top ranked) features are
   used to make a prediction on the seizure event. Further, to reduce the
   complexity of classification stage, a non-linear classifier is built
   based on the Adaboost algorithm using decision stumps (linear
   classifier) as the base classifier. The proposed algorithm achieves a
   sensitivity of 94.375\% for a total of 71 seizure events with a low
   false alarm rate of 0.13 per hour and 6.5\% of time spent in false
   alarms using an average of 5 features for the Freiburg database. The low
   computational complexity of the proposed algorithm makes it suitable for
   an implantable device.}},

Abstract = {{The question of how many channels should be sed for classification
   remains a key issue in the study of Brain-Computer Interface. Several
   studies have shown that a reduced number of channels can achieve the
   optimal classification accuracy in the offline analysis of motor imagery
   paradigm, which does not have real-time feedback as in the online
   control. However, for the cursor movement control paradigm, it remains
   unclear as to how many channels should be selected in order to achieve
   the optimal classification. In the present study, we gradually increased
   the number of channels, and adopted the time-frequency-spatial
   synthesized method for left and right motor imagery classification. We
   compared the effect of increasing channel number in two datasets, an
   imagery-based cursor movement control dataset and a motor imagery tasks
   dataset. Our results indicated that for the former dataset, the more
   channels we used, the higher the accuracy rate was achieved, which is in
   contrast to the finding in the latter dataset that optimal performance
   was obtained at a subset number of channels. When gradually increasing
   the number of channels from 2 to all in the analysis of cursor movement
   control dataset, the average training and testing accuracies from three
   subjects improved from 68.7\% to 90.4\% and 63.7\% to 87.7\%,

Abstract = {{Language disorder is one of the core symptoms in schizophrenia. We

   Schizophrenia patients and healthy control subjects were instructed to
   discriminate semantically and syntactically correct sentences from
   syntactically correct but semantically incorrect sentences presented
   visually, and 248-channel MEG signals were recorded with a whole head
   machine during the task performance. Oscillation patterns were extracted
   from the MEG recordings in 8 frequency sub-bands throughout sentence
   processing, which form a large feature set. A two-step feature selection
   algorithm combining F-score filtering and Support Vector Machine
   recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) was designed to pick out a small
   subset of features which could discriminate patients and controls with
   high accuracy. We achieved a 90.48\% prediction accuracy based on the
   selected top features, following the leave-one-out cross validation
   procedure. These top features provide interpretable spectral, spatial,

Abstract = {{Even though electrocution has been recognized and studied for over a
   century, there remain several common misconceptions among medical
   professional as well as lay persons. This review focuses on
   ``low-power{''} electrocutions rather than on the ``high-power{''}
   electrocutions such as from lightning and power lines. Low-power
   electrocution induces ventricular fibrillation (VF). We review the 3
   established mechanisms for electrocution: (1) shock on cardiac T-wave,
   (2) direct induction of VF, and (3) long-term high-rate cardiac capture
   reducing the VF threshold until VF is induced. There are several
   electrocution myths addressed, including the concept - often taught in
   medical school - that direct current causes asystole instead of VF and
   that electrical exposure can lead to a delayed cardiac arrest by
   inducing a subclinical ventricular tachycardia (VT). Other
   misunderstandings are also discussed}},

Abstract = {{Epilepsy is a common neurological disease that affects about 50 million
   people worldwide. Extratemporal lobe epilepsy, which represents an
   important type of epilepsy, may involve seizure activity in various
   lobes and the surgical treatment in these patients tends to have less
   favorable surgical outcome. Noninvasive seizure imaging in
   drug-resistant patients is of vital importance to image the seizure
   onset zones (SOZs) and understand the mechanisms for an improved
   treatment plan. In this study, we directly imaged the seizure sources in
   8 extratemporal lobe partial epilepsy patients from noninvasive EEG. The
   surgically resected regions and SOZs identified from intracranial EEG
   (iEEG) recordings were used to evaluate the source imaging results. All
   of the eight patients underwent resective surgery and the estimated
   seizure sources were co-located with the resection zone. Seven of the
   patients had iEEG recordings available and the source imaging results
   were concordant with the SOZs marked on the intracranial recording grid.
   The present results suggest that dynamic seizure imaging could be
   potentially useful to image the SOZs of extratemporal lobe seizures and
   help the pre-surgical planning of epilepsy patients.}},

Abstract = {{The first recorded heart rhythm for cardiac arrest patients can either
   be ventricular fibrillation (VF) which is treatable with a
   defibrillator, or asystole or pulseless electrical activity (PEA) which
   are not. The time course for the deterioration of VF to either asystole
   or PEA is not well understood. Knowing the time course of this
   deterioration may allow for improvements in emergency service delivery.
   In addition, this may improve the diagnosis of possible electrocutions
   from various electrical sources including utility power, electric
   fences, or electronic control devices (ECDs) such as a TASER (R) ECD.
   We induced VF in 6 ventilated swine by electrically maintaining rapid
   cardiac capture, with resulting hypotension, for 90 seconds. No
   circulatory assistance was provided. They were then monitored for 40
   minutes via an electrode in the right ventricle. Only 2 swine remained
   in VF; 3 progressed to asystole; 1 progressed to PEA. These results were
   used in a logistic regression model. The results are then compared to
   published animal and human data.
   The median time for the deterioration of electrically induced VF in the
   swine was 35 minutes. At 24 minutes VF was still maintained in all of
   the animals. We conclude that electrically induced VF is long-lived -
   even in the absence of chest compressions.}},

Abstract = {{As energy infrastructure is upgraded to meet modern digital society's
   need for secure and high-quality electric power, grid-tied energy
   storage systems are becoming a viable means for improving system
   reliability and realizing the benefits of Smart Grid. This paper
   investigates the optimal implementation of distributed storage resources
   in a power distribution system or islanded microgrid in conjunction with
   an intelligent load shedding scheme to minimize the societal costs of
   blackouts. First, a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem for
   prioritizing outage ride-through service is formulated and a solution
   methodology is proposed that combines a local search heuristic with
   simulated annealing. Next, a resource allocation optimization problem is
   developed to determine the optimal mix and placement of energy storage
   resources in a power distribution network for intentional islanding of
   sectionalizable sub-networks. Simulations are performed on the IEEE 123
   node test feeder model subject to realistic power system constraints.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the design of linear precoders via instantaneous rate
   maximization over a K-user multicast channel, wherein multiple antennas
   are present at the transmitter as well as at all the receivers. We first
   consider the scenario wherein the linear precoder can be any complex
   valued matrix subject to rank and power constraints. Recognizing the
   resulting optimization problem to be NP-hard, we propose a cyclic
   alternating ascent based algorithm and establish its convergence to a
   stationary point. Simulation results reveal that our proposed algorithm
   considerably outperforms known competing solutions. We then consider a
   scenario in which the linear precoder can be formed by selecting and
   concatenating codewords from a finite codebook of precoding matrices,
   subject to rank and power constraints. We show that under this scenario,
   the instantaneous rate maximization problem is equivalent to a robust
   submodular maximization problem which is strongly NP-hard. We then
   propose a deterministic approximation algorithm and show that it yields
   a bicriteria approximation.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes have become one of the most favorable capacity achieving
   error correction codes (ECC) along with their simple encoding method.
   However, among the very few prior successive cancellation (SC) polar
   decoder designs, the required long code length makes the decoding
   latency high. In this paper, conventional decoding algorithm is
   transformed with look-ahead techniques. This reduces the decoding
   latency by 50\%. With pipelining and parallel processing schemes, a
   parallel SC polar decoder is proposed. Sub-structure sharing approach is
   employed to design the merged processing element (PE). Moreover,
   inspired by the real FFT architecture, this paper presents a novel input
   generating circuit (ICG) block that can generate additional input
   signals for merged PEs on-the-fly. Gate-level analysis has demonstrated
   that the proposed design shows advantages of 50\% decoding latency and
   twice throughput over the conventional one with similar hardware cost.}},

Abstract = {{The SHRP 2 R21 project on composite pavement investigated the durability
   of various mixtures of portland cement concrete (PCC) used in the
   construction of a two-layer composite PCC pavement. Project consultants
   in Europe, where composite PCC over PCC pavement was more common than in
   the United States, advised the R21 research team to consider using the
   CIF (capillary suction, internal damage, and freeze-thaw) standard of
   the International Union of Laboratories and Experts in Construction
   Materials, Systems, and Structures (RILEM), Paris, rather than the
   familiar ASTM standards. As a result, the R21 project adopted the RILEM
   CIF standard to evaluate the freeze-thaw durability and salt scaling
   resistance of concretes. The research also explored a modified RILEM CIF
   test (using pure water instead of a sodium chloride solution in scaling
   tests) alongside the standard RILEM CIF tests. The paper describes this
   experience to expose other institutions and agencies in the United
   States to the RILEM standards for the freeze-thaw durability and salt

Abstract = {{Modern transducer technology allows for the design and implementation of
   therapeutic arrays with relatively wide bandwidths (>50\%) and low cross
   coupling between elements. We present results from a 3.5 MHz, 64-element
   prototype designed for small-animal and superficial therapeutic HIFU
   applications (Imasonic, Inc.) This transducer has a 58\% 6-dB fractional
   BW average on its elements allowing for therapeutic output in the
   frequency range of 2.7 - 4.6 MHz. We present a simulation/experimental
   study to evaluate and optimize the focusing capabilities of the phased
   array prototype when excited by multiple-frequency components.
   Preliminary results have shown that multiple-frequency excitation may be
   beneficial in enhancing the therapeutic effects of HIFU beams. A
   multiple-focus pattern synthesis algorithm for arrays excited by
   multiple-frequency signals has been developed and tested using linear
   pressure field simulations. The algorithm maintains the precise phase
   relationship between the frequency components at each focal spot to
   achieve a desirable outcome. Hydrophone measurements to validate the
   approach show that nonlinear effects at the focal location are more
   prominent with the frequency mixing compared to conventional single
   frequency excitation. An in vitro study of lesion formation in freshly

Abstract = {{We have previously described several DMUA prototypes with therapeutic
   and imaging capabilities suited for image-guided surgery. A fully
   real-time system capable of intermittent therapy/imaging operation to
   allow for high frame rate imaging during therapeutic has been developed.
   This approach allows for real-time characterization of echoes from the
   target region at the focal spot within milliseconds of the initiation of
   the therapeutic pHIFU beam. For example, at intensity levels of similar
   to 8000 W/cm(2) at 1.15 MHz, analysis of echo data pre- and
   post-beamforming shows spotty transient activity from within the pHIFU
   focus, indicative of cavitation. Ex vivo tissue samples were exposed to
   pHIFU beams of durations < 300 ms at intensity levels in the range of
   2500 - 8000 W/cm(2) with interruptions to analyze echo data at frame
   rates from 100 to 2000 fps. Examination of treated tissue samples shows
   correspondence between the transient echoes and the nature of the
   induced lesion (when present). Coupled with the DMUA system's ability to
   refocus the pHIFU beam at > 1000 updates per second, this approach
   offers the physician a unique capability of modulating the exposure with
   millisecond resolution. Examples of monitoring and control of single-
   and multiple-focus DMUA patterns will be presented and discussed.}},

   patterns has been developed. The imaging system is implemented on a
   commercially available scanner (SonixRP) at frame rates > 500 fps with
   limited frame sizes covering the vicinity of the HIFU focal spot. These
   frame rates are sufficient to capture tissue motion and deformation even
   in the vicinity of large arteries. With the high temporal and spatial
   resolution of our strain imaging system, we are able to capture and
   separate tissue strains due to natural motion (breathing and pulsation)
   from HIFU induced strains (thermal and mechanical). We have collected in
   vivo strain imaging during sub-therapeutic and therapeutic HIFU exposure
   in swine and rat model. A 3.5-MHz phased array was used to generate
   sinusoidally-modulated pHIFU beams at different intensity levels and
   durations near blood vessels of different sizes (e. g. femoral in the
   swine and rat models). The results show that our approach is capable of
   characterizing the thermal and mechanical tissue response to
   sub-therapeutic pHIFU beam. For therapeutic pHIFU beams, the approach is

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for developing an improved feature
   selection technique that will help in accurate prediction of outcomes
   after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) for patients with
   acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML). Allogeneic HSCT using related or
   unrelated donors is the standard treatment for many patients with blood
   related malignancies who are unlikely to be cured by chemotherapy alone,
   but survival is limited by treatment-related mortality and relapse.
   Various genetic factors such as tissue type or human leukocyte antigen
   (HLA) type and immune cell receptors, including the killer-cell
   immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family can affect the success or
   failure of HSCT. In this paper we aim to develop a novel, aggregated
   ranking based feature selection technique using HLA and KIR genotype
   data, which can efficiently assist in donor selection before BMT and
   confer significant survival benefit to the patients. In our approach we
   use a rank aggregation based feature selection technique for selecting
   suitable donor genotype characteristics. The result obtained is
   evaluated with classifiers for prediction accuracy. On average, our
   algorithm improves the prediction accuracy of the results by 3-4\%
   compared to generic analysis without using feature selection or single
   feature selections algorithms. Most importantly the selected features
   completely agree with those obtained using traditional statistical
   approaches, proving the efficiency and robustness of our technique which
   has great potential in the medical domain.}},

Abstract = {{Breakthrough results in compressive sensing (CS) have shown that high
   dimensional signals (vectors) can often be accurately recovered from a
   relatively small number of non-adaptive linear projection observations,
   provided that they possess a sparse representation in some basis.
   Subsequent efforts have established that the reconstruction performance
   of CS can be improved by employing additional prior signal knowledge,
   such as dependency in the location of the non-zero signal coefficients
   (structured sparsity) or by collecting measurements sequentially and
   adaptively, in order to focus measurements into the proper subspace
   where the unknown signal resides. In this paper, we examine a powerful
   hybrid of adaptivity and structure. We identify a particular form of
   structured sparsity that is amenable to adaptive sensing, and using
   concepts from sparse hierarchical dictionary learning we demonstrate
   that sparsifying dictionaries exhibiting the appropriate form of
   structured sparsity can be learned from a collection of training data.
   The combination of these techniques (structured dictionary learning and
   adaptive sensing) results in an effective and efficient adaptive
   compressive acquisition approach which we refer to as LASeR (Learning
   Adaptive Sensing Representations.)}},

Abstract = {{Robust low-rank matrix estimation is a topic of increasing interest,
   with promising applications in a variety of fields, from computer vision
   to data mining and recommender systems. Recent theoretical results
   establish the ability of such data models to recover the true underlying
   low-rank matrix when a large portion of the measured matrix is either
   missing or arbitrarily corrupted. However, if low rank is not a
   hypothesis about the true nature of the data, but a device for
   extracting regularity from it, no current guidelines exist for choosing
   the rank of the estimated matrix. In this work we address this problem
   by means of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle - a well
   established information-theoretic approach to statistical inference - as
   a guideline for selecting a model for the data at hand. We demonstrate
   the practical usefulness of our formal approach with results for complex
   background extraction in video sequences.}},

Abstract = {{A novel approach to multi-hop routing for cognitive random access is
   developed under channel gain uncertainty constraints. Motivated by the
   inherent randomness of the propagation medium, the novel routing
   strategy leverages pairwise decoding probabilities to randomly route
   packets to neighboring nodes. The resultant cross-layer optimization
   framework not only provides optimal routes in a well-defined sense, but
   also yields transmission probabilities and transmit-powers, thus
   enabling cognizant adaptation of networking, medium access, and physical
   layer parameters to the operational environment. The relevant
   optimization problem is non-convex and hence hard to solve in general.
   Nevertheless, a successive convex approximation approach is employed to
   efficiently find a Karush-Kuhn- Tucker solution. Enticingly, the fresh
   look advocated here permeates benefits also to conventional multi-hop
   random access networks in the presence of channel uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous microgrids are operated and coordinated by intelligent
   automatic controls without any reliance on human intervention. In this
   paper, a simulation framework utilizing sequential Monte Carlo
   simulations is developed to investigate the performance of autonomous
   microgrids that have the ability to interconnect to achieve adequate
   load service. Detailed models of the various microgrid components and
   interconnection policies implemented are provided. In order to minimize
   the exposure of each microgrid to vulnerabilities, it is also desired
   that the number of interconnections be minimal. Using the developed
   framework, various simulation scenarios are explored. Results show the
   impact of storage capacity, intermittent distributed energy resources
   (DERs), and the ability to interconnect occasionally with other
   microgrids on each microgrid's security and reliability as measured
   using standard risk indices.}},

Abstract = {{A feasibility study was undertaken in order to investigate alternative
   noninvasive treatment options for atherosclerosis. In particular, the
   aim of this study was to investigate the potential use of Dual-Mode
   Ultrasound Arrays (DMUAs) for image guided treatment of atheromatous
   plaques.
   DMUAs offer a unique treatment paradigm for image-guided surgery
   allowing for robust image-based identification of tissue targets for
   localized application of HIFU. In this study we present imaging and
   therapeutic results form a 3.5 MHz, 64-element fenestrated prototype
   DMUA for targeting lesions in the femoral artery of familial
   hypercholesterolemic (FH) swine. Before treatment, diagnostic ultrasound
   was used to verify the presence of plaque in the femoral artery of the
   swine. Images obtained with the DMUA and a diagnostic (HST 15-8)
   transducer housed in the fenestration were analyzed and used for
   guidance in targeting of the plaque. Discrete therapeutic shots with an
   estimated focal intensity of 4000-5600 W/cm2 and 500-2000 msec duration
   were performed at several planes in the plaque. During therapy, pulsed
   HIFU was interleaved with single transmit focus imaging from the DMUA
   and M2D imaging from the diagnostic transducer for further analysis of
   lesion formation. After therapy, the swine's were recovered and later
   sacrificed after 4 and 7 days for histological analysis of lesion
   formation. At sacrifice, the lower half of the swine was perfused and
   the femoral artery with adjoining muscle was fixed and stained with H\&E
   to characterize HIFU-induced lesions.
   Histology has confirmed that localized thermal lesion formation within
   the plaque was achieved according to the planned lesion maps.
   Furthermore, the damage was confined to the plaque tissue without damage
   to the intima. These results offer the promise of a new treatment
   potentially suited for vulnerable plaques. The results also provide the
   first real-time demonstration of DMUA technology in targeting fine
   tissue structures for precise lesion formation in the presence or
   arterial pulsation and tissue motion. In this paper, we show results
   from targeting both proximal and distal sides of the vessel wall with a
   series of 5 - 7 discrete shots in each plane (typically three planes per
   plaque). Experiments to demonstrate a full treatment forming contiguous
   lesion within the target plaque are currently underway.}},

Abstract = {{In many sensor surveillance systems such as environment and habitat
   monitoring, sensors are deployed in an area to monitor several important
   locations where targets appear. As the sensor nodes are often powered by
   non-rechargeable batteries, it is crucial to extend the lifetime of
   sensor surveillance systems. How to cover multiple random targets and
   extend the system lifetime at the same time is a challenge. Previous
   studies show that data fusion improve coverage by exploiting the
   collaboration among sensors. However, they assume that targets
   deterministically appear at some specific locations and do not consider
   the randomness of the appearance of the targets. Considering both the
   high cost of the sensor surveillance system and various reliability
   requirements in practice, we explore the tradeoff between the system
   lifetime and the system reliability in this paper. We formulate the
   stochastic target coverage problem as probabilistic set covering. After
   showing its NP-Completeness, we design a PSC-based heuristic algorithm
   in the data fusion model. Extensive simulations show that the system
   lifetime can be extended dramatically with a small loss to the system
   reliability.}},

Abstract = {{We use Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation to investigate rotational
   relaxation in nitrogen from a first-principles perspective. The
   rotational relaxation process is found to be dependent not only on the
   near-equilibrium temperature, but more importantly on both the magnitude
   and direction of the initial deviation from the equilibrium state.
   Although this dependence has been previously recognized, it is here
   investigated systematically. The comparison between MD and Direct
   Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), based on the Larsen-Borgnakke model, for
   shock waves (both at low and high temperatures) and one-dimensional
   expansions shows that a judicious choice of a constant Z(rot) can
   produce DSMC results which are in relatively good agreement with MD.
   However, the selection of the rotational collision number is
   case-specific, depending not only on the temperature range, but more
   importantly on the type of flow (compression or expansion). Parker's
   model, with the commonly used parameters for nitrogen suggested by Lordi
   and Mates, overpredicts the magnitude of Z(rot) for temperatures above
   about 300 K. Finally, based on the MD data, a preliminary formulation
   for a novel directional rotational relaxation model, which includes a
   dependence on both the rotational and the translational state of the
   gas, is presented.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this work is to model the heterogeneous recombination of
   atomic oxygen on silica surfaces, which is of interest for accurately
   predicting the heating on vehicles traveling at hypersonic velocities.
   This is accomplished by creating a finite rate catalytic model, which
   describes recombination from an atomistic perspective with a set of
   elementary gas-surface reactions. Fundamental to surface catalytic
   reactions are the chemical structures on the surface where recombination
   can occur. Using molecular dynamics simulations with the ReaxFF
   potential, we find that the chemical sites active in oxygen atom
   recombination on silica surfaces consist of a small number of specific
   defects. The individual reactions in our finite rate catalytic model are
   based on the possible outcomes of oxygen interaction with these defects.
   The parameters of the functional forms of the rates, including
   activation energies and pre-exponential factors, are found by carrying
   out molecular dynamics simulations of individual events. We find that
   the recombination coefficients predicted by the finite rate catalytic
   model display an exponential dependence with temperature, in qualitative
   agreement with experiment at between 1000 K - 1500 K. However, the
   ReaxFF potential requires reparametrization with new quantum chemical
   calculations specific to the reaction pathways presented in this work.}},

Abstract = {{From 1974 through 2010, the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)
   collected nearly 147,000 respirable dust samples with a mass of at least
   0.1 mg and a minimum of 1\% quartz. These samples represent about 50\%
   of all respirable dust compliance samples collected by MSHA. Analysis of
   these data shows that pockets of high concentrations and overexposure
   continue to exist. At underground mines, from 2005 to 2010, occupations
   with >20\% of the samples exceeding the permissible exposure limit (PEL)
   and geometric mean quartz concentrations exceeding the ACGIH threshold
   limit value of 25 mu g/m3 included mucking, crusher operator, general
   laborer/utility, and front-end loader operator. During the same period,
   stone and rock saw operators and bagger and packers working at surface
   mines and mills also had >20\% of the samples exceeding the PEL and
   geometric mean quartz concentrations >25 mu g/m3. Regardless of mine
   type or location, slow but steady improvement in exposure levels is seen
   in jobs involving crushing operations, which are widespread in the
   mining industry. Crusher operators are more likely to work in an
   enclosed area where it is easier to apply dust controls and air
   conditioning. A downward trend is also observed for vehicle equipment
   operators who drive load-haul-dumps, front-end loaders, trucks, and
   similar equipment. Crusher operators and vehicle equipment operators
   represent occupational categories that are widely sampled by MSHA
   inspectors. A small but statistically significant reduction in the
   overall mean respirable quartz dust and quartz concentrations from 1993
   to 2010 was observed in most commodity groups. Variability from year to
   year and between commodities is high. Reduction in respirable quartz
   dust concentration does not necessarily correspond to a reduction in
   quartz concentration within the same commodity group. These trends are
   consistent with those reported in previous studies.}},

Pages = {{804-816}},
Abstract = {{A new strength test method for asphalt binders at low temperatures is
   investigated in this paper. A modified Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR),
   capable of applying loads at different rates, is used to obtain asphalt
   binder flexural strength. Strength values obtained from the BBR test are
   compared with strength values obtained from the Direct Tension Tester
   (DTT) test and significant differences are found between the two tests.
   Additional BBR strength tests are run on asphalt binder beams after
   replacing the ethanol used in the cooling bath with potassium acetate,
   similar to DTT testing conditions, and flexural strengths significantly
   larger than those obtained with ethanol are obtained. Weakest link
   theory is used to convert three-point bending strength to direct tension
   strength and to perform volume correction of DTT values. Based on the
   corrected values, the BBR and DTT strength measurements are similar,
   when the same cooling medium is used. The effect of the cooling medium
   on BBR creep stiffness is also evaluated. From the limited experimental
   tests, it appears that there are no significant differences in stiffness
   and m-value after 1 h of isothermal storage.}},

Abstract = {{Phase response curves (PRCs) characterize response properties of
   oscillating neurons to pulsetile input and are useful for linking the
   dynamics of individual neurons to network dynamics. PRCs can be easily
   computed for model neurons. PRCs can be also measured for real neurons,
   but there are many issues that complicate this process. Most of these
   complications arise from the fact that neurons are noisy on several
   time-scales. There is considerable amount of variation (jitter) in the
   inter-spike intervals of ``periodically{''} firing neurons. Furthermore,
   neuronal firing is not stationary on the time scales on which PRCs are
   usually measured. Other issues include determining the appropriate
   stimuli to use and how long to wait between stimuli.
   In this chapter, we consider many of the complicating factors that arise
   when generating PRCs for real neurons or ``realistic{''} model neurons.
   We discuss issues concerning the stimulus waveforms used to generate the
   PRC and ways to deal with the effects of slow time-scale processes (e.g.
   spike frequency adaption). We also address issues that are present
   during PRC data acquisition and discuss fitting ``noisy{''} PRC data to
   extract the underlying PRC and quantify the stochastic variation of the
   phase responses. Finally, we describe an alternative method to generate
   PRCs using small amplitude white noise stimuli.}},

Abstract = {{The pursuit of high fuel efficiency and low emissions has inspired a lot
   of research efforts on automotive powertrain hybridization. Targeted at
   developing a real-time hybrid energy management strategy, a stochastic
   dynamic programming - extremum seeking (SDP-ES) optimization algorithm
   with both the system states and output feedback is investigated in this
   paper. This SDP-ES algorithm utilizes a state-feedback control, which is
   offline generated by the stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), as a
   reference term to ensure the approximate global energy optimality and
   battery state-of-charge (SOC) sustainability. And in real-time, this
   algorithm injects a ``local{''} feedback term via extremum seeking (ES),
   which is a non-model-based nonlinear optimization method, to compensate
   the control commands from the SDP and generate more fuel-efficient
   operation points along the specific SOC sustaining line, by leveraging
   the real-time measurement of system outputs (fuel consumption and
   emissions). The simulation results show the SDP-ES algorithm can provide
   desirable improvement of fuel economy based on the original SDP.}},

Abstract = {{In this study we present a procedure for the design and implementation
   of a control strategy to optimize energy use within a light weight
   hydraulic hybrid passenger vehicle. The hydraulic hybrid utilizes a high
   pressure accumulator for energy storage which has superior power density
   than conventional battery technology. This makes fluid power attractive
   for urban driving applications in which there are frequent starts and
   stops and large startup power demands. The proposed design method
   improves the powertrain's operational efficiency by finding the best
   balance between optimizing individual component efficiencies. The
   optimization problem was implemented using the model predictive control
   framework because it requires no future information about the drive
   cycle in its design. Hardware-in-the-loop experiments using an
   electro-hydraulic powertrain testbed were then used to validate the
   dynamic model and control performance.}},

Abstract = {{For a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) approach to be viable, the
   air compressor/expander must be sufficiently powerful and efficient.
   Since efficiency is governed by heat transfer, there is a generally a
   tradeoff between efficiency and compression/expansion time (or power).
   In this paper, we determine Pareto optimal compression/expansion
   profiles for a liquid piston air compressor/expander that maximizes
   efficiency (power) for a given power (efficiency). Compared to previous
   works, a numerical optimization approach is proposed that allows for
   more general heat transfer model, the consideration of the viscous
   friction, and system limitations in the optimization. The resulting
   optimal profiles are compared to other trajectories. At compression
   ratio of 10, the optimal profile results in 10\%-40\% increase in power
   density relative to other methods. Optimal geometries that trades off
   friction and heat transfer improvement can also be determined using this
   method.}},

Abstract = {{The problem considered in this paper is that of approximating a sample
   covariance matrix by one with a Toeplitz structure. The importance stems
   from the apparent sensitivity of spectral analysis on the linear
   structure of covariance statistics in conjunction with the fact that
   estimation error destroys the Toepliz pattern. The approximation is
   based on appropriate distance measures. To this end, we overview some of
   the common metrics and divergence measures which have been used for this
   purpose as well as introduce certain alternatives. In particular, the
   metric induced by Monge-Kantorovich transportation of the respective
   probability measures leads to an efficient linear matrix inequality
   (LMI) formulation of the approximation problem and relates to
   approximation in the Hellinger metric. We compare these with the maximum
   likelihood and the Burg method on a representative case study from the
   literature.}},

Abstract = {{Free-piston engine (FPE), as an alternative of the conventional internal
   combustion engine, has a high potential in terms of energy saving given
   its wide range of potential applications and high efficiency. One of the
   technical barriers that prevents the wide spread of this technology is
   the lack of precise piston motion control. This paper presents a novel
   strategy on the motion control of a hydraulic FPE. A robust repetitive
   controller is designed and implemented to form a virtual crankshaft that
   would provide a precise and stable engine operation. Based on the
   controller, a hardware-in-theloop (HIL) environment that integrates the
   combustion chamber dynamics with the hydraulic system is developed to
   further validate the proposed control design. The experimental data of
   engine motoring tests with virtual crankshaft control demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies open-loop operation of flashing ratchets, which refer
   to mechanisms that enable motion of particles under diffusion and
   possibly drag forces along a preferred direction through alternating
   turning on and off of specifically designed ratchet potentials. Flashing
   ratchets are used to model certain transport mechanisms of molecular
   motors and are of special interest to biologists and biophysicists.
   Mathematically they are are modeled by stochastic hybrid systems. For an
   open-loop design of on-times and off-times, we derive, under certain
   practical assumptions, an exact probability density function that
   reflects the spatial distribution of particles in space after the
   ratchet has flashed a given number of times, and find an optimal
   off-time that maximizes the transport velocity for a specific ratchet
   potential. Validation of the underlying assumptions is also presented.
   Simulation results show that these open-loop designs achieve as good or
   better average velocities for particles over certain well known existing
   feedback strategies in literature.}},

Abstract = {{Skin-friction drag reduction by transverse wall oscillations has
   received significant attention of flow control community. Both
   experiments and simulations have demonstrated that oscillations with
   properly selected amplitude and frequency can reduce turbulent drag by
   as much as 40 percent. For a turbulent channel flow, we develop a
   model-based approach to design oscillations that suppress turbulence. We
   show that judiciously selected linearization of the flow with control
   can be used to determine turbulent viscosity in a computationally
   efficient manner. The resulting correction to the turbulent mean
   velocity is then used to identify optimal frequency of oscillations,
   which is in close agreement with previously conducted experimental and
   numerical studies. This demonstrates the predictive power of our
   simulation-free approach to controlling turbulent flows.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the expressions that define compressibility of hydraulic
   medium are used to develop a nonlinear spring-like model for a hydraulic
   actuator. Using this model, an energy based controller for passive
   bilateral tele-operation of hydraulic actuator is designed. The control
   problem is posed to achieve power amplification from the master to the
   slave. The unknown external forces on the slave system are assumed to be
   constant and are estimated using techniques from direct adaptive
   control. Efficacy of the controller is evaluated by implementing it on a
   single degree-of-freedom setup. Experimental results demonstrate good
   co-ordination characteristics both in free space and when encountering a
   hard surface.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrogen is considered as an alternative to fossil fuels for energy
   production due to its high energy density and zero carbon emissions. It
   is typically produced from hydrocarbons via steam reforming or the water
   gas shift (WGS) reaction. In this paper, we develop a distributed model
   for a WGS membrane reactor which achieves higher carbon monoxide
   conversions than these achieved by conventional packed bed reactors. A
   steady-state analysis under different flow configurations reveals the
   presence of large temperature gradients (hot spots) in the reactor.
   Open-loop simulations demonstrate the necessity for a control strategy
   to suppress the hot spot and maintain the operation of the reactor under
   a specified temperature reflecting a catalyst operating limitation.
   Three different control strategies are proposed and a case study
   illustrates and evaluates their performance. A comparative study between
   a nonlinear and a PI controller is also performed.}},

Abstract = {{We study the design of feedback gains that strike a balance between the
   H-2 performance of distributed systems and the sparsity of controller.
   Our approach consists of two steps. First, we identify sparsity patterns
   of feedback gains by incorporating sparsity-promoting penalty functions
   into the H-2 problem, where the added terms penalize the number of
   communication links in the distributed controller. Second, we optimize
   feedback gains subject to structural constraints determined by the
   identified sparsity patterns. In the first step, we identify sparsity
   structure of feedback gains using the alternating direction method of
   multipliers, which is a powerful algorithm well-suited to large
   optimization problems. This method alternates between optimizing the
   sparsity and optimizing the closed-loop H-2 norm, which allows us to
   exploit the structure of the corresponding objective functions. In
   particular, we take advantage of the separability of sparsity-promoting
   penalty functions to decompose the minimization problem into
   sub-problems that can be solved analytically. An example is provided to
   illustrate the effectiveness of the developed approach.}},

   that connects two oscillators as the measure of the amount of

   addresses the trade-off between synchronization performance and

   penalizing the number of interconnection links. For identical
   oscillators, we establish convexity and show that the design problem can
   be formulated as a semidefinite program. For non-identical oscillators,
   that can be considered as perturbations around a central (average)
   oscillator, we show that it is meaningful to design an optimal
   conductance network by assuming that all oscillators are identical to
   the central oscillator. Finally, for special classes of oscillator
   networks we derive explicit formulas for the optimal conductance values.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the design of a low order robust stabilizer for
   the tracking/disturbance rejection problem based on the internal model
   principle in the time varying setting. The existing stabilization
   approaches are either lack of robustness or results in a high order
   design, which limits the potential for broad application. The method
   proposed in this paper overcomes this bottleneck by taking advantage of
   the unique structure of the time varying internal model based control
   system. Instead of using a dynamic stabilizer with high order, this
   approach uses a sequence of time varying gains that are injected into
   the internal model unit. A critical issue addressed is how to avoid the
   non-convex optimization associated with the time varying gain synthesis
   and then convert the stabilizer design into a series of convex Linear
   Matrix Inequality (LMI) constraints. The approach is then validated on
   an experimental system and demonstrated to be robust and computationally
   efficient.}},

Abstract = {{We present a graded index (GRIN) design methodology for application in
   coherent beam shaping within the confines of geometric optics. In
   theory, a GRIN structure can be designed to convert a specific but
   arbitrary incident wave into any general amplitude and phase
   distribution. The incident and the desired output waves are converted
   into ray distributions where the local ray density is associated with
   the field amplitude and the ray direction and its optical path length
   are associated with the phase front of the waves. A set of ray paths is
   chosen to achieve the conversion between the initial and final ray
   distributions. Intermediate wavefronts are extrapolated from the ray
   paths and used to determine the refractive index profile required to
   effect the gradual evolution of the wave as it propagates through the
   structure. Our method is demonstrated by a GRIN structure design that
   converts a Gaussian beam into a flattop beam. In addition, several
   techniques used to reduce the dynamic range of the refractive index in
   the structure are examined and a design recipe is developed for this
   particular application. A ray trace shows that the resulting structure
   achieves the desired remapping of rays and produces a flat-top beam from
   an incident Gaussian beam.}},

Abstract = {{Common Spatial Pattern algorithm (CSP) is widely used in Brain Machine
   Interface (BMI) technology to extract features from dense electrode
   recordings by using their weighted linear combination. However, the CSP
   algorithm, is sensitive to variations in channel placement and can
   easily overfit to the data when the number of training trials is
   insufficient. Construction of sparse spatial projections where a small
   subset of channels is used in feature extraction, can increase the
   stability and generalization capability of the CSP method. The existing
   l(0) norm based sub-optimal greedy channel reduction methods are either
   too complex such as Backward Elimination (BE) which provided best
   classification accuracies or have lower accuracy rates such as Recursive
   Weight Elimination (RWE) and Forward Selection (FS) with reduced
   complexity. In this paper, we apply the Oscillating Search (OS) method
   which fuses all these greedy search techniques to sparsify the CSP
   filters. We applied this new technique on EEG dataset IVa of BCI
   competition III. Our results indicate that the OS method provides the
   lowest classification error rates with low cardinality levels where the
   complexity of the OS is around 20 times lower than the BE.}},

Abstract = {{Back-pressure routing and power control policies are well-appreciated
   for maximizing throughput in wireless multi-hop networks, where power
   control is used to manage interference in a way that ultimately
   optimizes throughput, a network-layer performance measure. In addition
   to transmitter power control, interference can be mitigated via
   selective receiver-side signal cancellation, provided that the signal to
   be cancelled can be reliably decoded. This paper considers joint
   back-pressure power control and interference cancellation, assuming that
   each receiver can cancel at most one interfering signal. It is shown
   that the joint problem is NP-hard, and a suitable convex approximation
   is developed and shown to yield significant gains in terms of end-to-end
   throughput relative to power control alone. The main methodological
   contribution is in terms of a fortuitous reformulation of the joint
   problem, which is of potentially broader interest.}},

Abstract = {{Two hemicellulose fractions were obtained by extraction of one-month-old
   young bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens Mazel). The fractionation
   procedure employed 2\% NaOH as extractant, followed by filtration,
   acidification, precipitation, and washing with 70\% ethanol solution.
   The total yield was 26.2\%, based on the pentosan content in bamboo. The
   physicochemical properties were determined and sugar composition
   analysis showed that the hemicelluloses consisted mainly of xylose,
   arabinose, galactose, and a small amount of uronic acid. Furthermore,
   based on FT-IR and NMR spectra analyses, the structure of hemicelluloses
   was determined to be mainly arabinoxylans linked via (1 ->
   4)-beta-glycosidic bonds with branches of arabinose and
   4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid. The molecular weights were 6387 Da and
   4076 Da, corresponding to the hemicelluloses HA and HB. Finally, the
   thermal stability was elucidated using the TG-DTG method. The obtained
   results can provide important information for understanding young bamboo
   and the hemicelluloses in it.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient tools are needed to identify routes and schedules to evacuate
   affected populations to safety in the event of natural disasters.
   Hurricane Rita and the recent tsunami revealed limitations of
   traditional approaches to provide emergency preparedness for evacuees
   and to predict the effects of evacuation route planning (ERP).
   Challenges arise during evacuations due to the spread of people over
   space and time and the multiple paths that can be taken to reach them;
   key assumptions such as stationary ranking of alternative routes and
   optimal substructure are violated in such situations. Algorithms for ERP
   were first developed by researchers in operations research and
   transportation science. However, these proved to have high computational
   complexity and did not scale well to large problems. Over the last
   decade, we developed a different approach, namely the Capacity
   Constrained Route Planner (CCRP), which generalizes shortest path
   algorithms by honoring capacity constraints and the spread of people
   over space and time. The CCRP uses time-aggregated graphs to reduce
   storage overhead and increase computational efficiency. Experimental
   evaluation and field use in Twin Cities Homeland Security scenarios
   demonstrated that CCRP is faster, more scalable, and easier to use than
   previous techniques. We also propose a novel scalable algorithm that
   exploits the spatial structure of transportation networks to accelerate
   routing algorithms for large network datasets. We evaluated our new
   approach for large-scale networks around downtown Minneapolis and
   riverside areas. This article summarizes experiences and lessons learned
   during the last decade in ERP and relates these to Professor Goodchild's
   contributions.}},

Abstract = {{Industry routers are very complex and time consuming, and are becoming
   more so with the explosion in design rules and design for
   manufacturability requirements that multiply with each technology node.
   Global routing is just the first phase of a router and serves the dual
   purpose of (i) seeding the following phases of a router and (ii)
   evaluating whether the current design point is routable. Lately, it has
   become common to use a ``light mode{''} version of the global router,
   similar to today's academic routers, to quickly evaluate the routability
   of a given placement. This use model suffers from two primary
   weaknesses: (i) it does not adequately model the local routing
   resources, while the model is important to remove opens and shorts and
   eliminate DRC violations, (ii) the metrics used to represent congestion
   are non-intuitive and often fail to pinpoint the key issues that need to
   be addressed. This paper presents solutions to both issues, and
   empirically demonstrates that incorporating the proposed solutions
   within a global routing based congestion analyzer yields a more accurate
   view of design routability.}},

Abstract = {{Although Heusler alloys have been known for more than a century, but
   since the last decade there has been a quantum jump in research in this
   area. Heusler alloys show remarkable properties, such as ferromagnetic
   shape memory effect, magnetocaloric effect, half metallicity, and most
   recently it has been shown that it can be used for direct conversion of
   heat into electricity. Heusler alloys Ni-Mn-Z (Z=Ga, Al, In, Sn, Sb),
   show a reversible martensitic transformation and unusual magnetic
   properties. Other classes of intermetallic Heusler alloy families that
   are half metallic (such as the half Heusler alloys Ni-Mn-Sb and the full
   Heusler alloy Co2MnGe) are attractive because of their high Curie
   temperature and structural similarity to binary semiconductors. Unlike
   Ni-Mn-Ga, Ni-Mn-In and Ni-Mn-Sn transform from ferromagnetic austenite
   to non-ferromagnetic martensite. As is consistent with the
   Clausius-Clapeyron equation, the martensitic phase transformation can be
   manipulated by a magnetic field, leading to possible applications of
   these materials enabling the magnetic shape memory effect, energy
   conversion and solid state refrigeration. In this paper, we summarize
   the salient features of Heusler alloys, like the structure, magnetic
   properties and potential application of this family of alloys in
   industry.}},

Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{11310-11317}},
Abstract = {{Coarse-grained theories of dense polymer liquids such as block copolymer
   melts predict a universal dependence of equilibrium properties on a few
   dimensionless parameters. For symmetric diblock copolymer melts, such
   theories predict a universal dependence on only chi N and (N) over bar,
   where chi is an effective interaction parameter, N is the degree of
   polymerization, and (N) over bar is a measure of overlap. We test
   whether simulation results for the structure factor S(q) obtained from
   several different simulation models are consistent with this
   two-parameter scaling hypothesis. We compare results from three models:
   (1) a lattice Monte Carlo model, the bond-fluctuation model, (2) a
   bead-spring model with harsh repulsive interactions, similar to that of
   Kremer and Grest, and (3) a bead-spring model with very soft repulsion
   between beads, and strongly overlapping beads. We compare results from
   pairs of simulations of different models that have been designed to have
   matched values of (N) over bar, over a range of values of chi N and N,
   and devise methods to test the scaling hypothesis without relying on any
   prediction for how the phenomenological interaction parameter chi
   depends on more microscopic parameters. The results strongly support the
   scaling hypothesis, even for rather short chains, confirming that it is
   indeed possible to give an accurate universal description of simulation
   models that differ in many details.}},

   learning is an active research area in machine learning. In many
   supervised-learning applications, data can be naturally separated into
   several groups, or tasks, and incorporating this information into
   learning may improve generalization. There are many Multi-Task Learning
   (MTL) techniques for classification recently proposed in machine
   learning. This paper focuses on analysis and comparison of the two
   recent SVM-based MTL techniques: regularized MTL (rMTL) and SVM+ based
   MTL (SVM+MTL). In particular, our analysis shows how these two methods
   can be implemented using standard SVM software. Further, we present
   extensive empirical comparisons between these two methods, which relates
   advantages/limitations of each method to statistical characteristics of

Abstract = {{An improved model for predicting oxygen transfer efficiency at gated
   sills is presented. An analysis of field measurements from eight gated
   sill structures is used to develop a dimensionless relationship between
   inflow conditions, dam geometry and oxygen transfer efficiency. The
   oxygen transfer coefficient is estimated from scaled formulations of the
   liquid film coefficient, mean bubble diameter, air entrainment rate and
   turbulent energy dissipation rate. The model is validated with
   additional field measurements adjusted for temperature and effective
   saturation concentration. A design parameter for gated sill dams is
   introduced giving a relationship between gate opening and oxygen
   transfer efficiency. Improved prediction of oxygen transfer in the field
   is a tool that can be used to successfully operate gated structures to
   meet oxygen concentration requirements and to assist in the design of
   remediation technologies.}},

Abstract = {{With recent advances in high-throughput proteomics and systems biology,
   there is a growing demand for new instruments that can precisely
   quantify a wide range of receptor-ligand binding kinetics in a
   high-throughput fashion. Here we demonstrate a surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) imaging spectroscopy instrument capable of simultaneously
   extracting binding kinetics and affinities from 50 parallel microfluidic
   channels. The instrument utilizes large-area (similar to cm(2)) metallic
   nanohole arrays as SPR sensing substrates and combines a broadband light
   source, a high-resolution imaging spectrometer and a low-noise CCD
   camera to extract spectral information from every channel in real time
   with a refractive index resolution of 7.7 x 10(-6) refractive index
   units. To demonstrate the utility of our instrument for quantifying a
   wide range of biomolecular interactions, each parallel microfluidic
   channel is coated with a biomimetic supported lipid membrane containing
   ganglioside ( GM1) receptors. The binding kinetics of cholera toxin b
   (CTX-b) to GM1 are then measured in a single experiment from 50
   channels. By combining the highly parallel microfluidic device with
   large-area periodic nanohole array chips, our SPR imaging spectrometer
   system enables high-throughput, label-free, real-time SPR biosensing,
   and its full-spectral imaging capability combined with nanohole arrays
   could enable integration of SPR imaging with concurrent surface-enhanced
   Raman spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of optimizing the ratio Tr{[}V-T
   AV]/Tr{[}V-T BV] over all unitary matrices V with p columns, where A, B
   are two positive definite matrices. This problem is common in supervised
   learning techniques. However, because its numerical solution is
   typically expensive it is often replaced by the simpler optimization
   problem which consists of optimizing Tr{[}V-T AV] under the constraint
   that V-T BV = I, the identity matrix. The goal of this paper is to
   examine this trace ratio optimization problem in detail, to consider
   different algorithms for solving it, and to illustrate the use of these

   The model uses auxiliary variables to account for outliers and to detect

   estimate the model parameters. The proposed approach is conceptually

Abstract = {{Reliability and energy efficiency are critical issues in wireless sensor
   networks. In this work, we study Delay-bounded Energy-constrained
   Adaptive Routing (DEAR) problem with reliability, differential delay,
   and transmission energy consumption constraints in wireless sensor
   networks. We aim to route the connections in a manner such that link
   failure does not shut down the entire stream but allows a continuing
   flow for a significant portion of the traffic along multiple paths. This
   flexibility enabled by a multi-path routing scheme has the tradeoff of
   differential delay among the different paths. This requires increased
   memory in the base station to buffer the traffic until the data arrives
   on all the paths. Therefore, differential delay between the multiple
   paths should be bounded in a range to reduce additional hardware cost in
   the base station. Moreover, the energy consumption constraint should
   also be satisfied when transmitting packets among multiple paths. We
   present a pseudo-polynomial time solution to solve a special case of
   DEAR, representing edge delays as integers. Next, an (1 +
   alpha)-approximation algorithm is proposed to solve the optimization
   version of the DEAR problem. An efficient heuristic is provided for the
   DEAR problem. We present numerical results confirming the advantage of
   our schemes as the first solution for the DEAR problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the GeoFeed system; a location-aware news feed
   system that provides a new platform for its users to get spatially
   related message updates from either their friends or favorite news
   sources. GeoFeed distinguishes itself from all existing news feed
   systems in that it enables users to post message with spatial extent
   rather than static point locations, and takes into account their
   locations when computing news feed for them. GeoFeed is equipped with
   three different approaches for delivering the news feed to its users,
   namely, spatial pull, spatial push, and shared push. We design a smart
   model for GeoFeed to decide about using these approaches in a way that:
   (a) minimizes the system overhead for delivering the locationaware news
   feed, and (b) guarantees a certain response time for each user to obtain
   the requested location-aware news feed. GeoFeed also supports
   location-aware news feed function for its mobile users. Experimental
   results, based on real and synthetic data, show that GeoFeed outperforms
   existing news feed systems in terms of response time and maintenance
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{Large graphs are used in many applications, such as social networking.
   The management of these graphs poses new challenges because such graphs
   are too large to fit on a single server. Current distributed techniques
   such as map-reduce and Pregel are not well-suited for processing
   interactive ad-hoc queries against large graphs. In this paper we
   demonstrate Horton, a distributed interactive query execution engine for
   large graphs. Horton defines a query language that allows expressing
   regular language reachability queries and provides a query execution
   engine with a query optimizer that allows interactive execution of
   queries on large distributed graphs in parallel. In the demo, we show
   the functionality of Horton managing a large graph for a social
   networking application called Codebook, in which a graph models data on
   software components, developers, development artifacts (such as bug
   reports), and their interactions in large software projects.}},

   introduce a Modified Householder QR algorithm which fully exploits the

   of the EKF update, based on our QR factorization scheme, reduces to
   O(N-3). Finally, we validate the Modified Householder QR algorithm
   through extensive simulations, and demonstrate its superior performance
   both in terms of accuracy and CPU runtime, as compared to the current

   two robots, each equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and a

   common features, observed over a sliding-window time horizon, in order
   to improve the localization accuracy of both vehicles. In contrast to
   existing CL methods, which require robot-to-robot distance and/or
   bearing measurements to resolve the robots' relative position and
   orientation (pose), our approach recovers the relative pose through
   indirect information from the commonly observed features. Moreover, we
   analyze the system observability properties to determine how many
   degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of the relative transformation can be
   computed under different measurement scenarios. Lastly, we present
   simulation results to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a domain-specific language for programming mobile
   robots that is based on hierarchical state machines. Following Brooks,
   we refer to states as behaviors. A novelty of this language is that
   behaviors are treated as first class objects in the language and thus
   they can be passed as arguments to other parameterized behaviors. The
   language has template behaviors which allow generalized behaviors to be
   customized and instantiated. This makes the language quite flexible in
   terms of programming styles. An example of its flexibility are
   presented, followed by a description of the challenges in the language
   design.}},

Abstract = {{One of the most important tasks for mobile robots is to sense their
   environment. Further tasks might include the recognition of objects in
   the surrounding environment. Three dimensional range finders have become
   the sensors of choice for mapping the environment of a robot.
   Recognizing objects in point clouds provided by such sensors is a
   difficult task. The main contribution of this paper is the introduction
   of a new covariance based point cloud descriptor for such object
   recognition. Covariance based descriptors have been very successful in
   image processing. One of the main advantages of these descriptors is
   their relatively small size. The comparisons between different
   covariance matrices can also be made very efficient. Experiments with
   real world and synthetic data will show the superior performance of the
   covariance descriptors on point clouds compared to state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{Modeling human motion in complex environments without losing long-range
   dependencies is difficult due to the large number of combinatorially
   distinct paths humans may follow. Existing representations avoid this
   difficulty by limiting the prediction of human motion to a local level.
   As a result, robot motion planning algorithms that use these
   representations are reactive in nature, and fail to exploit higher-order
   dependencies. We present a novel motion model capable of representing
   the global path behavior of people. Our model compactly encodes
   higher-order temporal dependencies inherent in human mobility traces on
   an abstract representation of the environment that lends itself to
   combinatorial planning. We incorporate uncertainties into the planning
   process using POMDPs and present a general predictive multi-robot
   planning algorithm applicable to pedestrian datasets commonly found in
   the literature. We evaluate our planner by simulating multiple instances
   of a variant of the visibility-based target-tracking problem inspired by
   our previous work. We report encouraging results that demonstrate our
   multi-robot plans exhibit desirable combinatorial structure, e.g. robot
   re-use.}},

Abstract = {{In order to fuse camera and odometer measurements, we first need to
   estimate their relative transformation through the so-called
   odometer-camera extrinsic calibration. In this paper, we present a
   two-step analytical least-squares solution for the extrinsic
   odometer-camera calibration that (i) is not iterative and finds the
   least-squares optimal solution without any initialization, and (ii) does
   not require any special hardware or the presence of known landmarks in
   the scene. Specifically, in the first step, we estimate a subset of the
   3D relative rotation parameters by analytically minimizing a
   least-squares cost function. We then back-substitute these estimates in
   the measurement constraints, and determine the rest of the 3D
   transformation parameters by analytically minimizing a second
   least-squares cost function. Simulation and experimental results are
   presented that validate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{The parametric shifts or circuit failures caused by transistor aging
   have become more severe with shrinking device sizes and voltage margins.
   Designing circuits that can withstand these aging effects is
   particularly critical in medical applications where systems must operate

   this work we present several on-chip Silicon Odometers that provide
   measurement data required to develop transistor degradation models. One
   such scheme-a beat frequency detection circuit capable of recording
   oscillator frequency shifts ranging down to a theoretical limit of less
   than 0.01\%-may be suited to trigger real-time adjustments that
   compensate for lost performance on products in the field. Incorporating
   this sensing capability may be especially attractive in implantable

Abstract = {{A position authentication system utilizing the white noise like GPS
   spreading codes as tamper proof watermarks is described. Position
   authentication as used in this paper means the process of checking
   whether position reports made by a remote user are truthful and
   accurate. In the method proposed, a segment of the GPS signal collected
   by a trusted user (called the authenticator) is used as a template.
   Another user's (called the supplicant) GPS signal is compared with the
   template to judge if the user's position and time report is authentic.
   An analysis to explain how noise affects the watermark signal detection
   is presented. The paper also discusses an important implementation
   issue: Multiple false peaks caused by CIA power leakage which mask the
   detection of the watermark. Experimental results show that the
   authentication method proposed can detect deceptive position report and
   the resolution of the position authentication is at or better than 15
   meters. This method may also be used in other GNSS system, for example
   Galileo, by utilizing the encrypted Public Regulated Service signal as

Title = {{Turbulent flow and scalar transport through and over aligned and

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{33}},
Pages = {{1-36}},
Abstract = {{Wind farm-atmosphere interaction is complicated by the effect of turbine
   array configuration on momentum, scalar and kinetic energy fluxes. Wind
   turbine arrays are often arranged in rectilinear grids and, depending on
   the prevailing wind direction, may be perfectly aligned or perfectly
   staggered. The two extreme configurations are end members with a
   spectrum of infinite possible layouts. A wind farm of finite length may
   be modeled as an added roughness or as a canopy in large-scale weather
   and climate models. However, it is not clear which analogy is physically
   more appropriate. Also, surface scalar flux, including heat, moisture
   and trace gas (e.g. CO2), are affected by wind farms, and need to be
   properly parameterized in large-scale models. Experiments involving
   model wind farms, in aligned and staggered configurations, were
   conducted in a thermally controlled boundary-layer wind tunnel.
   Measurements of the turbulent flow were made using a custom
   x-wire/cold-wire probe. Particular focus was placed on studying the
   effect of wind farm layout on flow adjustment, momentum and scalar
   fluxes, and turbulent kinetic energy distribution. The flow statistics
   exhibit similar turbulent transport properties to those of canopy flows,
   but retain some characteristic surface-layer properties in a limited
   region above the wind farms as well. The initial wake growth over
   columns of turbines is faster in the aligned wind farm. However, the
   overall wake adjusts within and grows more rapidly over the staggered
   farm. The flow equilibrates faster and the overall momentum absorption
   is higher for the staggered compared to the aligned farm, which is
   consistent with canopy scaling and leads to a larger effective
   roughness. Surface heat flux is found to be altered by the wind farms
   compared to the boundary-layer flow without turbines, with lower flux
   measured for the staggered wind farm.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBULENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{27}},
Abstract = {{Wind-tunnel experimental data from the wake of a model wind turbine were
   used to provide a scale-by-scale energetic description of the flow at
   various locations downwind of the turbine. Pre-multiplied spectra of the
   streamwise and vertical velocity components were considered for the
   analysis and compared with those obtained in the base flow (smooth wall
   condition). Results showed that in the relatively high-frequency range,
   the turbine induces strong turbulent energy into the wake, which is an
   indicator of its active character. However, large scales and very large
   scales were observed to be dampened in the wake close to the wall,
   implying that the turbine also acts as a high-pass filter. These two
   distinct processes occurring in the wake suggest to conceptualize and
   model the turbine as an `active filter'. Various terms in the turbulent
   kinetic energy (TKE) equation were also estimated at different locations
   to study the physical processes modulating the enhanced levels of
   turbulence intensity observed in the wake of wind turbines. Two length
   scales were defined in terms of u(rms)(3), TKE and dissipation. These
   scales, estimated at the hub height, showed to be promising in
   describing the wake dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Intervertebral disc degeneration is a cell-mediated process that results
   in the disruption of its function. These changes are difficult to
   overturn; consequently, early diagnosis is key for the success of any
   treatment. Clinically, disc degeneration is diagnosed by analyzing
   morphological changes characteristic of moderate to advanced stages of
   degeneration. Therefore, there is a need of a reliable biomarker to
   characterize the compositional and structural integrity of the disc in
   early stages of degeneration. In this study, shear modulus is proposed
   as a new biomarker for disc degeneration and a non-invasive method to
   measure this mechanical property is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic Speaker Recognition (ASR) has been an active area of research
   for the past four decades with speech collected mostly in research
   laboratory environments. However, due to growing applications and
   possible misuses of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) networks, there
   is a need to employ robust ASR systems over VoIP networks, especially
   within the context of Internet security and law enforcement activities.
   There is, however, little systematic study on analyzing effects of
   several artifacts of VoIP (such as speech codec, packet loss, packet
   reordering, network jitter and foreign-cross talk or echo) on
   performance of an ASR system. This chapter investigates each of the
   issues of VoIP individually and trades it with the performance of the
   ASR system. In this chapter, a narrowband 2.4 kbps mixed-excitation
   linear prediction (MELP) codec is used over a VoIP network.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},

Abstract = {{We investigate solving semidefinite programs (SDPs) with an interior
   point method called SDP-CUT, which utilizes weighted analytic centers
   and cutting plane constraints. SDP-CUT iteratively refines the feasible
   region to achieve the optimal solution. The algorithm uses Newton's
   method to compute the weighted analytic center. We investigate different
   stepsize determining techniques. We found that using Newton's method
   with exact line search is generally the best implementation of the
   algorithm. We have also compared our algorithm to the SDPT3 method and
   found that SDP-CUT initially gets into the neighborhood of the optimal
   solution in less iterations on all our test problems. SDP-CUT also took
   less iterations to reach optimality on many of the problems. However,
   SDPT3 required less iterations on most of the test problems and less
   time on all the problems. Some theoretical properties of the convergence
   of SDP-CUT are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A computational framework of time integrators, termed GS4-1, is

   framework consists of a family of algorithms by design with desirable

   that the present computational framework naturally inherits features
   that permit selective control of the high-frequency damping for the
   primary variable and its time derivative, respectively, which is a new
   feature not available in existing methods. Consequently, the
   developments enable physically representative and accurate solutions of
   both variables. We first present, in Part 1, the derivation of such a
   framework with application to linear heat transfer problems. The
   significance of the present developments in capturing the problem
   physics via the selective control feature is demonstrated through an
   application to a simple illustrative one-dimensional problem for which
   an analytic solution is available. The extension of the framework for

Abstract = {{A novel computational methodology under the umbrella of the so-called
   GS4-1 framework is presented in this series of articles for use in
   solving time-dependent heat transfer problems. In Part 1 of this series,
   we presented the framework for linear applications. In this Part 2, we
   show how this framework can be properly extended for use in nonlinear
   applications. The present computational framework and the underlying
   numerical methodology naturally inherit desirable features including
   second-order time accuracy, unconditional stability, and controllable
   numerical dissipation. Of noteworthy mention and significance is the
   fact that the framework, additionally, inherits new features that permit
   selective control of high-frequency damping for both the primary
   variable and its time derivative. Consequently, the development enables
   not only the analysis of long-term system dynamics to be satisfactory,
   but also readily enables one to capture the underlying physics. The
   current state of the art does not permit such features and consequently
   leads to physically incorrect dynamics of the system. Additionally, we
   describe in this article all the possible approaches that can be
   employed in the computational procedure to take into account the
   nonlinearity of the problem. The essential concepts and the significance
   of the present development are demonstrated through application to a
   simple radiation heat transfer problem for which an analytic solution is

Abstract = {{Cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) is used to control engine out NOx
   (oxides of nitrogen) emissions from modern diesel engines by
   re-circulating a portion of the exhaust gases into the intake manifold
   of an engine after cooling it through a heat exchanger commonly referred
   to as an EGR cooler. However, EGR cooler fouling due to presence of soot
   particles and hydrocarbons (HC) in engine exhaust leads to a decrease in
   cooler efficiency and increased pressure drop across the cooler. This
   can adversely affect the combustion process, engine durability, and
   emissions. In this study, a multicylinder diesel engine was used to
   produce a range of engine out HC and soot concentrations to investigate
   soot deposition and particle nucleation in an EGR cooler. A portion of
   the engine exhaust was passed through an EGR cooler, while particle size
   and HC concentration measurements were made at the cooler inlet and
   outlet. Tests were conducted over a range of EGR cooler coolant
   temperatures and engine out soot and HC concentrations to determine the
   impact on the nucleation and accumulation modes of the exhaust particle
   size distributions. A reduction in the accumulation mode particle
   concentration at the EGR cooler outlet was observed for high soot
   concentrations indicating soot deposition within the EGR cooler. As the
   EGR coolant temperature was reduced, the outlet accumulation mode
   particle concentration was reduced further, indicating increased soot
   deposition in the cooler due to increased thermophoresis. There were no
   signs of diffusiophoresis due to HC diffusion within the cooler over the
   range of conditions used in the study. A significant increase in outlet
   nucleation mode particle concentration was observed for the low soot
   concentrations. This mode increased with either increasing HC
   concentration or decreasing coolant temperature, indicating the
   saturation ratio (SR) dependence of the nucleation mode formation.
   However, as the soot concentration was increased, the nucleation mode
   disappeared because of HC adsorption onto the increased soot surface
   area.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental work has been conducted to develop a
   calibration reference device that could be used in test facilities that
   conform to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 52.2 2007. After exploring alternative
   concepts, including electrostatic precipitators, cyclones, and wire mesh
   screens, a three-stage parallel flow inertial impactor using round
   orifices as flow nozzles was selected. Small-scale versions were
   fabricated and tested for flow rate versus pressure drop and particle
   capture efficiency versus size. The full-scale prototype was fabricated
   from aluminum and stainless steel and tested in a wind tunnel configured
   according to ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 52.2 2007. Oleic acid and potassium
   chloride aerosols were introduced, and the upstream and downstream
   particle concentrations were measured with optical particle counters
   with the channels as required in the standard. Results show a pressure
   drop of 950 Pa (3.8 in. water) at 0.944 m(3)/s (2000 cfm) rather than
   the 750 Pa (3.0 in. water) used in the design. Particle collection
   efficiency for liquid oleic acid particles nearly agrees with the design
   theory and provides a minimum efficiency reporting value value of 9.
   However, solid KCl particles larger than about 3 microns are not
   captured well, perhaps caused by particle bounce from the porous,
   oil-impregnated impaction plates. Additional theoretical work is
   required on pressure drop and solid particle capture for impactors of
   this design before theoretical predictions agree well with the measured
   results.}},

Abstract = {{Free-standing, flexible V2O5-graphene composite films were prepared by
   simple filtration of aqueous dispersions of V2O5 nanowires and graphene
   sheets. V2O5 nanowires were preferentially oriented along the plane of
   the film as they were sandwiched between stacked graphene sheets in the
   composite film. The V2O5 content in the composites was adjusted simply
   by varying the relative amount of the dispersions. Thermal annealing at
   300 degrees C increased the conductivity of the composite films. Due to
   their integrated structure and high flexibility, the composite films
   were directly usable as flexible electrodes. In binder-free,
   sandwich-type lithium battery cells, a composite film containing 75.8
   wt\% V2O5 delivered discharge capacities of 283 mAh g(-1) and 252 mAh
   g(-1) at a current density of 50 mA g(-1) during the first and 50th
   cycles, respectively. Owing to its higher conductivity, a composite film
   containing 42.8 wt\% V2O5 delivered a discharge capacity of 189 mAh
   g(-1) at 750 mA g(-1). The good performance resulted from the integrated
   structure of the V2O5 network embedded in stratified graphene
   nanosheets, with V2O5 as the Li+ host and graphene nanosheets providing
   the electron pathway. These composite films are promising candidates for
   electrical energy storage applications that require flexible electrodes.

Title = {{The Collision Rate of Nonspherical Particles and Aggregates for all
   Diffusive Knudsen Numbers}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1174-1186}},
Abstract = {{We examine theoretically and numerically collisions of arbitrarily
   shaped particles in the mass transfer transition regime, where
   ambiguities remain regarding the collision rate coefficient (collision
   kernel). Specifically, we show that the dimensionless collision kernel
   for arbitrarily shaped particles, H, depends solely on a correctly
   defined diffusive Knudsen number (Kn(D), in contrast with the
   traditional Knudsen number), and to determine the diffusive Knudsen
   number, it is necessary to calculate two combined size parameters for
   the colliding particles: the Smoluchowski radius, which defines the
   collision rate in the continuum (Kn(D) -> 0 ) regime, and the projected
   area, which defines the collision rate in the free molecular (Kn(D) ->
   infinity) regime. Algorithms are provided to compute these parameters.
   Using mean first passage time calculations with computationally
   generated quasifractal (statistically fractal) aggregates, we find that
   with correct definitions of H and Kn(D), the H(Kn(D)) relationship found
   valid for sphere-sphere collisions predicts the collision kernel for
   aggregates extremely well (to within +/- 5\%). We also show that it is
   critical to calculate combined size parameters for colliding particles,
   that is, a collision size/radius cannot necessarily be defined for a
   nonspherical particle without foreknowledge of the geometry of its
   collision partner. Specifically for sequentially produced model
   aggregates, expressions are developed through regression to evaluate all
   parameters necessary to predict the transition regime collision kernel
   directly from fractal descriptors.}},

Abstract = {{An unsteady numerical model coupling radiative-conductive-convective
   heat and mass transfer to chemical kinetics of heterogeneous
   decomposition is developed for a semi-transparent and optically large
   CaCO3 reacting particle exposed to direct high-flux irradiation. Two
   decomposition models are studied: a shrinking core model, with a
   well-defined CaO-CaCO3 interface between the spherical unreacted CaCO3
   core and the porous CaO spherical shell around the core, and a
   volumetric model, with changing grain size throughout the particle. The
   Rosseland diffusion approximation is employed to solve for internal
   radiative transfer in the particle. The mass and energy equations are
   solved numerically by employing the finite volume method and the
   explicit Euler time integration scheme. For fixed CO2 partial pressure
   and total gas phase pressure, the computed temperature profiles show the
   features typical for a heat transfer limited reaction. The volumetric
   reaction model leads to a faster chemical conversion as compared to that
   for the shrinking core model, by 41.3\%. For CO2 pressure increasing due
   to the chemical reaction and diffusion of CO2 being the only mass
   transfer mode inside the porous particle, the reaction becomes mass
   transfer limited. The increasing partial pressure of CO2 inhibits the
   chemical reaction, leading to an increase of the total reaction time by
   a factor of 433 and 734 for SCM and VM, respectively, compared to the

Abstract = {{The past decade has produced numerous CPU architectural innovations.
   These have included multiple cores per CPU, multiple simultaneous
   threads per core, and, especially with GPUs, highly complex memory
   hierarchies. As a result, performance portability has become a major
   challenge to programmers. We identify the SIMD engines in modern CPU and
   GPU cores as the key to obtaining high performance for scientific
   application codes. This common element of all present computing devices
   makes performance portability possible. However, we find that achieving
   this performance requires us to express the code in terms of intrinsic
   functions for the SIMD engine instructions, and these functions are
   different for each device. To assist the programmer in creating the
   necessary code expression for each vendor's compilers, we have build an
   automated code translator that takes as input a single Fortran source
   code, written in a special style and annotated with directives, and
   creates output code for each device and compiler combination. The manual
   translations for GPU permit us here to evaluate the performance that our
   code transformations deliver on these devices. We present a performance

Abstract = {{Modeling of the liquefaction reaction kinetics for the low-input
   high-diversity mixtures of native grassland perennials was studied. The
   highest liquid yield of 82\% was achieved within a short residence time
   of 1 minute at 374 degrees C and 22.1 MPa. Seven possible reaction
   schemes and kinetic models were developed and compared. The unknown
   kinetic parameters of each model were estimated by nonlinear least
   square method. Model 3, assuming that biomass first decomposes to
   condensable hydrocarbons or tars (liquid products), gaseous products,
   and solid chars via three competitive reactions and then tars are
   subjected to a second cracking reaction producing gases, is found to be
   the best one closely matching the experimental yield data obtained from
   liquefaction of prairie grasses. The effects of temperature on reaction
   rate constants for all the reactions except the biomass conversion to
   char were best described by Arrhenius-type equations. The model
   developed here in addition to helping better understand the fundamentals
   of reaction kinetics of biomass liquefaction is also helpful for
   prediction of three lumped products liquid products, gaseous products,
   and solid chars, and rough design of biomass liquefaction reactors and
   subsequent techno-economic analysis of the process.}},

Journal = {{NUMERICAL HEAT TRANSFER PART A-APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{81-94}},
Abstract = {{This article is concerned with duct flows in which the fluid encounters
   a patterned array of structures along its path of flow. A heat-exchanger
   tube bank is an example of a patterned array of structures, whose
   deployment repeats periodically in the flow direction. There are three
   issues to be highlighted here. The first relates to the model used in
   standard commercial software that deals with periodic structures. That
   model envisions the periodic structure to be a porous medium. This
   approach is also used in the analysis of heat-exchanger performance. The
   second issue concerns the nature of the flow that follows the breakdown
   of the friction-dominated laminar regime. The third focus is the
   identification of the location of the maximum velocity within the
   periodic structure. It was found that the porous-medium model is a
   viable approach, thereby adding support to current heat and fluid-flow
   models of heat exchangers. The nature of the flow following the
   breakdown of the friction-dominated laminar regime is shown to be a
   continuation of laminar flow, but with important contributions of
   momentum transfer. This finding definitively excludes the hypothesis
   that the onset of turbulence occurs immediately following the breakdown
   of laminar flow. The location of the maximum velocity was shown not to
   correspond to the location of the minimum free-flow area.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we describe a novel thermosensitive triblock copolymer in
   an ionic liquid (IL) that shows a
   low-temperature-sol-high-temperature-gel transition. A well-defined ABA
   triblock copolymer consisting of poly(benzyl methacrylate) as the
   terminal A blocks and poly(methyl methacrylate) as the middle B block
   (P(BnMA-b-MMA-b-BnMA), BMB) was successfully synthesized using atom
   transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) from a bifunctional initiator.
   The number-average molecular weights of the PBnMA blocks and the PMMA
   block were estimated to be 25 kDa and 33 kDa, respectively. The
   temperature dependence of the hydrodynamic radius obtained from dynamic
   light scattering showed that in dilute solutions (0.1 wt\%) the triblock
   copolymer exhibited lower critical micellization temperature (LCMT)-type
   aggregation behaviour around 135 degrees C in a common hydrophobic IL,
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide
   ({[}C(2)mim]{[}NTf2]). Dynamic viscoelastic measurements for a 20 wt\%
   BMB solution in {[}C(2)mim]{[}NTf2] confirmed that a viscous liquid at
   low temperature (G' (storage elastic modulus) < G `' (loss elastic
   modulus)) becomes a gel (ion gel) (G' > G `') upon heating above the
   aggregation temperature of the PBnMA terminal blocks. No gelation was
   observed when the triblock copolymer concentration was below 10 wt\%.
   Furthermore, the thermoreversible ion gel exhibited excellent sol-gel
   transition reversibility for multiple heating/cooling cycles performed
   over several days.}},

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics techniques have been applied to model fluid
   flow in the vicinity of oceanographic temperature probes. A major goal
   of the modeling effort is the determination of drag coefficients for
   probe descent into ocean water. These drag coefficients can be used, in
   conjunction with a dynamic model of the probe, to predict the depth of
   the probe during descent. Accurate depth information is essential for
   the proper measurement of ocean temperatures and, consequently, ocean
   heating associated with climate change. Until recently, probe depths
   were predicted with the use of experimental calibrations which relate
   time-of-flight and depth. Those calibrations are limited in their
   accuracy, they are confined to conditions that match the experiments
   from which the calibrations were determined, and they are unable to
   account for variations in quantities such as the drop height or initial
   probe mass. The dynamic model and drag coefficient calculations
   presented here are, to the best knowledge of the authors, the first to
   include the impact of probe rotation. It is hoped that this new
   technique can be applied to the archive of oceanographic probe
   measurements and that improvements to ocean temperature monitoring will
   result.}},

Title = {{Determination of the Scalar Friction Factor for Nonspherical Particles
   and Aggregates Across the Entire Knudsen Number Range by Direct
   Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},

Abstract = {{The friction factor of an aerosol particle depends upon the Knudsen
   number (Kn), as gas molecule-particle momentum transfer occurs in the
   transition regime. For spheres, the friction factor can be calculated
   using the Stokes-Millikan equation (with the slip correction factor).
   However, a suitable friction factor relationship remains sought-after
   for nonspherical particles. We use direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC)
   to evaluate an algebraic expression for the transition regime friction
   factor that is intended for application to arbitrarily shaped particles.
   The tested friction factor expression is derived from dimensional
   analysis and is analogous to Dahneke's adjusted sphere expression. In
   applying this expression to nonspherical objects, we argue for the use
   of two previously developed drag approximations in the continuum (Kn ->
   0) and free molecular (Kn -> infinity) regimes: the Hubbard-Douglas
   approximation and the projected area (PA) approximation, respectively.
   These approximations lead to two calculable geometric parameters for any
   particle: the Smoluchowski radius, R-S, and the projected area, PA.
   Dimensional analysis reveals that Kn should be calculated with PA/pi R-S
   as the normalizing length scale, and with Kn defined in this manner,
   traditional relationships for the slip correction factor should apply
   for arbitrarily shaped particles. Furthermore, with this expression,
   Kn-dependent parameters, such as the dynamic shape factor, are readily
   calculable for nonspherical objects. DSMC calculations of the
   orientationally averaged drag on spheres and test aggregates (dimers,
   and open and dense 20-mers) in the range Kn = 0.05-10 provide strong
   support for the proposed method for friction factor calculation in the
   transition regime. Experimental measurements of the drag on aggregates
   composed of 2-5 primary particles further agree well with DSMC results,
   with differences of less than 10\% typically between theoretical
   predictions, numerical calculations, and experimental measurements.}},

Pages = {{4399-4411}},
Abstract = {{Nucleation of particles composed of sulfuric acid, water, and nitrogen
   base molecules was studied using a continuous flow reactor. The
   particles formed from these vapors were detected with an ultrafine
   condensation particle counter, while vapors of sulfuric acid and
   nitrogen bases were detected by chemical ionization mass spectrometry.
   Variation of particle numbers with sulfuric acid concentration yielded a
   power dependency on sulfuric acid of 5 +/- 1 for relative humidities of
   14-68\% at 296 K; similar experiments with varying water content yielded
   power dependencies on H2O of similar to 7. The critical cluster contains
   about 5 H2SO4 molecules and a new treatment of the power dependency for
   H2O suggests about 12 H2O molecules for these conditions. Addition of
   2-to-45 pptv of ammonia or methyl amine resulted in up to millions of
   times more particles than in the absence of these compounds. Particle
   detection capabilities, sulfuric acid and nitrogen base detection, wall
   losses, and the extent of particle growth are discussed. Results are
   compared to previous laboratory nucleation studies and they are also
   discussed in terms of atmospheric nucleation scenarios.}},

Title = {{Group lassoing change-points in piecewise-constant AR processes}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Abstract = {{Regularizing the least-squares criterion with the total number of
   coefficient changes, it is possible to estimate time-varying (TV)
   autoregressive (AR) models with piecewise-constant coefficients. Such
   models emerge in various applications including speech segmentation,
   biomedical signal processing, and geophysics. To cope with the inherent
   lack of continuity and the high computational burden when dealing with
   high-dimensional data sets, this article introduces a convex
   regularization approach enabling efficient and continuous estimation of
   TV-AR models. To this end, the problem is cast as a sparse regression
   one with grouped variables, and is solved by resorting to the group
   least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso). The fresh look
   advocated here permeates benefits from advances in variable selection
   and compressive sampling to signal segmentation. An efficient
   block-coordinate descent algorithm is developed to implement the novel
   segmentation method. Issues regarding regularization and uniqueness of
   the solution are also discussed. Finally, an alternative segmentation
   technique is introduced to improve the detection of change instants.
   Numerical tests using synthetic and real data corroborate the merits of
   the developed segmentation techniques in identifying piecewise-constant
   TV-AR models.}},

Abstract = {{Outpatient appointment system design is a complex problem because it
   involves multiple stakeholders, sequential booking process, random
   arrivals, no-shows, varying degrees of urgency of different patients'
   needs, service time variability, and patient and provider preferences.
   Clinics use a two-step process to manage appointments. In the first
   step, which we refer to as the clinic profile setup problem, service
   providers' daily clinic time is divided into appointment slots. In the
   second step, which we refer to as the appointment booking problem,
   physicians' offices decide which available slots to book for each
   incoming request for an appointment. In this chapter, we present
   formulations of mathematical models of key problems in the area of
   appointment system design. We also discuss the challenges and
   complexities of solving such problems. In addition, summaries of prior
   research, particularly advanced models related to the examples shown in
   this chapter are also presented.}},

   regulates platelet dense-body granule secretion}},
Journal = {{PLATELETS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{259-263}},
Abstract = {{Cytoskeletal F-actin assembly and microtubule reorganization are
   principal cellular events responsible for activation-induced platelet
   shape change; however, their roles in regulating platelet secretion have
   remained controversial. Herein, label-free microelectrochemistry
   techniques and pharmacological approaches are used to probe the role of
   F-actin and the microtubule in platelet dense-body secretion. Altered
   microtubule integrity via exposure to paclitaxel or vincristine had no
   effect on serotonin release in platelet suspensions. Disruption of
   F-actin by cytochalasin D (CytoD) or latrunculin A (LatA) substantially
   enhanced the rate of serotonin release, while inhibition of the
   F-actin-dependent platelet motor protein myosin IIA by blebbistatin had
   no effect. CytoD-treated platelets also showed enhanced serotonin
   quantal secretion rate. These results clearly indicate that F-actin, but
   not the microtubule, regulates platelet dense-body secretion and does so
   by serving as a physical barrier. This study also demonstrates the
   promise of microelectrochemistry for giving important insight into
   platelet quantal secretion mechanisms in future studies.}},

Abstract = {{Solution-processed bulk heterojunction solar cells from silicon
   nanocrystals (Si NCs) and poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) have shown
   promising power conversion efficiencies. Here we report on an attempt to
   enhance the performance of Si NC-polymer hybrid solar cells by using
   poly{[}2-methoxy-5-(3',7'-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]
   (MDMO-PPV) as a hole conductor, which is expected to yield a higher open
   circuit voltage than P3HT due to its lower highest occupied molecular
   orbital (HOMO). Bulk heterojunction solar cells consisting of 3-5 nm
   silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) and poly
   {[}2-methoxy-5-(3',7'-dimethyloctyloxy)-1,4-phenylenevinylene]
   (MDMO-PPV) have been fabricated. The properties of the hybrid Si
   NC/MDMO-PPV devices were studied as a function of the Si NC/MDMO-PPV
   weight ratio. Cells of 58 wt\% 3-5 nm Si NCs showed the best overall
   performance under simulated one-sunAM 1.5 global illumination (100 mW
   cm(-2)). Compared to composite films of Si NCs and
   poly(3-hexylthiophene), we indeed observed an improved open circuit
   voltage but a lower power conversion efficiency from the Si NC/MDMO-PPV
   devices. The lower efficiency of Si NC/MDMO-PPV is correlated to the
   lower hole mobility and narrower absorption spectrum of MDMO-PPV
   compared to P3HT.}},

Pages = {{695-717}},
Abstract = {{A Euclidean distance matrix (EDM) is one in which the (i, j) entry
   specifies the squared distance between particle i and particle j. Given
   a partially specified symmetric matrix A with zero diagonal, the
   Euclidean distance matrix completion problem (EDMCP) is to determine the
   unspecified entries to make A an EDM.
   We survey three different approaches to solving the EDMCP. We advocate
   expressing the EDMCP as a non-convex optimization problem using the
   particle positions as variables and solving using a modified Newton or
   quasi-Newton method. To avoid local minima, we develop a randomized
   initialization technique that involves a nonlinear version of the
   classical multidimensional scaling, and a dimensionality relaxation
   scheme with optional weighting.
   Our experiments show that the method easily solves the artificial
   problems introduced by More and Wu. It also solves the 12 much more
   difficult protein fragment problems introduced by Hendrickson, and the
   six larger protein problems introduced by Grooms, Lewis and Trosset.}},

Pages = {{127-130}},
Abstract = {{In this study, using steady-state electrochemistry at a rotating disk
   electrode, a deposition mechanism for giant magnetostrictive Fe1-xGax
   alloys is proposed in which the formation of an adsorbed monovalent
   {[}Fe(1)](ads) intermediate is determined to be the rate-determining
   step. In subsequent steps, this intermediate either gets reduced to iron
   or catalyzes the reduction of gallium by forming an adsorbed
   {[}Ga(III)-Fe(I)](ads) intermediate. In line with the proposed
   mechanism, it was experimentally shown that the differences in the
   mass-transport rates of Fe(II) species determined the thin film
   composition. Therefore, this study has made possible a controllable and
   reproducible deposition of Fe1-xGax thin films with compositions in the
   entire range of interest (15\%-30\% Ga). As-grown Fe80Ga20 thin films
   were found to have magnetostriction constants of similar to 112 ppm. (C)

   patient and one impatient. Orders from the patient class can be
   backordered if needed, while orders from the impatient class must be
   rejected if they cannot be fulfilled from on-hand inventory. Orders
   backordered incur a backorder cost, while orders rejected incur a lost
   sales cost. The objective is to minimize the sum of inventory holding
   cost and the costs of backorders and lost sales. We formulate the
   problem as a Markov decision process and use this formulation to
   characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the
   optimal policy can be described by two threshold functions that depend
   on the level of backorders from the patient class. These threshold
   functions specify: 1) when it is optimal to produce; 2) how to allocate
   units produced to either increase inventory or reduce backorder; and 3)
   when to fulfill orders from on-hand inventory and when to backorder (in
   the case of the patient class) and when to reject them (in the case of
   the impatient class). We show that the priority in inventory allocation
   among the two classes is not static and instead depends on the backorder
   level from the class of patient customers. In particular, it is possible
   to start out fulfilling orders from the impatient class and backordering
   orders from the patient class and then to switch to fulfilling orders
   from the patient class and rejecting orders from the impatient class. In
   addition to characterizing the structure of the optimal policy, we also
   describe an effective heuristic that retains the essential features of
   the optimal policy but is significantly simpler to implement. This
   heuristic performs nearly as well as the optimal policy and
   significantly outperforms other plausible heuristics.
   Note to Practitioners-Most of the existing academic literature assumes
   that, in the case of inventory shortage, demand is always either
   backordered or rejected (or fulfilled through some other means at a
   higher cost). This implicitly assumes that either all customers are
   patient and willing to wait for their orders until they are fulfilled or
   all customers are impatient and walk away if their orders are not
   immediately fulfilled. However, in practice, there are many settings
   where both types of customers are present. The presence of both types of
   customers makes the management of such systems more difficult since it
   requires setting priorities on how inventory should be allocated and how
   this allocation should affect production decisions. In fact, very little
   is known about optimal control policies or even effective heuristics for
   such systems. In this paper, we provide insights into the optimal policy
   for production and inventory allocation. We show that the optimal policy
   can be complex and with counter-intuitive features. As an alternative to
   the optimal policy, we provide a simple and easy to implement heuristic
   that performs nearly as well.}},

Title = {{Building a Communication Bridge With Mobile Hubs}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON AUTOMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Mobile robots can be used as mobile hubs to provide communication
   services on-demand. This capability is especially valuable in disaster
   response scenarios where there is no communication infrastructure. In
   such scenarios, mobile hubs can provide a communication infrastructure
   in a dynamic fashion.
   In this paper, we study the problem of building a communication bridge
   between a source and a destination t with mobile robots. Given a set of
   robots P and their initial locations, our goal is to find a subset S of
   robots and their final locations such that the robots in S create a
   communication bridge between and in their final locations. We introduce
   a new optimization problem for building communication bridges. The
   objective is to minimize the number of hubs (i.e., vertical bar S
   vertical bar ), while simultaneously minimizing the robots' motion. The
   two mobility measures studied in this paper are: (i) maximum travel
   distance and (ii) total travel distance of the robots. For a geometric
   version of the problem where the robots must move onto the line segment
   {[}s, t], we present polynomial time algorithms which use the minimum
   number of hubs while remaining within a constant factor of a given
   motion measure.
   Note to Practitioners-Mobile robotic hubs can provide connectivity
   service in applications such as disaster response where the underlying
   communication infrastructure is broken. In such applications, often a
   communication bridge between two sites (e.g., a command center and a
   specific site) must be established. In such scenarios, robots can
   autonomously deploy themselves and create a communication bridge.
   In this work, we study the efficient use of mobile robots to create a
   communication bridge between a source and a destination t. This yields a
   challenging resource allocation problem in which mobility and
   communication constraints must be addressed simultaneously.
   Specifically, we study the following problem: Given and s and t, the
   initial locations of the mobile hubs, find their final locations so as
   to minimize the number of hubs used in the bridge and (either maximum or
   total) distance traveled by the hubs. We present efficient, provably
   correct approximation algorithms for a special version of this
   optimization problem in which the hubs are required to move onto the
   line segment {[}s, t]. From a practical perspective, this special case
   is important because on the open plane it minimizes the overall number
   of hubs on the bridge. Thus, our algorithms can be used in scenarios
   such as robots operating in open spaces (land, water, or air). From a
   theoretical perspective, it provides an important first step toward the
   solution of the general problem where the hubs can be placed at
   arbitrary locations.}},

Abstract = {{This study provides an evaluation of the nature of sub-23-nm particles
   downstream of the European Particulate Measurement Programme (PMP)
   methodology, with prescribed cycles and on-road flow-of-traffic driving
   conditions. Particle number concentrations and size distributions were
   measured using two PMP measurement systems running simultaneously. For
   this analysis, the focus is on the real-time results from multiple
   instruments. The results revealed that a significant fraction of
   particles downstream of both PMP systems for all tested cycles were
   below 11 nm. The fraction of sub-11-nm particles observed downstream of
   the PMP system decreased when the overall dilution ratio of one PMP
   system was increased from 300 to 1500, suggesting those sub-11-nm
   particles were formed through re-nucleation of semivolatile precursors.
   When the evaporation tube temperature was increased from 300 degrees C
   to 500 degrees C, no difference in particle number concentrations was
   observed, suggesting that incomplete evaporation of semivolatile
   particles did not contribute to those sub-11-nm particles. Particle
   emissions were about one order of magnitude higher during
   flow-of-traffic driving along a highway with a steep grade than during
   the prescribed driving cycles. During the same flow-of-traffic
   condition, a sudden jump in PMP operationally defined solid particle
   concentration was observed, while the accumulation mode particle
   concentrations in the constant volume sampling (CVS) tunnel measured by
   an engine exhaust particle sizer (EEPS) only showed a slight increase.
   This discrepancy was attributed to the extensive growth of the
   re-nucleated particles downstream of the PMP systems.}},

Pages = {{203-216}},
Abstract = {{Alfalfa stems and ground aspen were exposed to peracetic acid (0.5 to
   9\% on biomass) at temperatures ranging from 40 to 100 degrees C and
   reaction times from 1 to 5 hours. Glucose release as a percentage of
   total cellulose content was determined using subsequent standard
   enzymatic hydrolysis. Statistical analysis confirmed that aspen showed a
   strong response to peracetic acid addition rate. 9\% peracetic acid
   removed 14\% of the original lignin and increased the rate of glucose
   release from 23\% to 44\%. Temperature and reaction time played a less
   significant role. For alfalfa stems, low levels of peractic acid (0.5\%)
   increased glucose release from 30 to 47\%. The addition of larger doses
   of peracetic acid did not show any significant improvement; this effect
   appears to be closely related to rate of lignin removal. While peracetic
   acid effectively removed lignin from aspen, 98\% of the original lignin
   was still present in alfalfa after higher level peracetic acid
   treatments; the yield loss observed during pretreatment of alfalfa stems
   originates from other biomass components.}},

Abstract = {{Anisotropic diffusions are classified by the second eigenvalue of the
   Hessian matrix associated with the diffusivity function into two
   categories: one incapable of edge-sharpening and the other capable of
   selective edge-sharpening. A third class is proposed: the eigenvalue
   starts with a small value and decreases monotonically with image
   gradient magnitude, so that the stronger the edge is, the more it is
   sharpened. Two families of such diffusivity functions are proposed.
   Numerical simulations indicate that the noise removal performance of
   anisotropic diffusion does not correlate with the shape of the
   diffusivity function, but is, instead, determined by the shape of the
   second eigenvalue function. Diffusivity functions in the third category
   produce the best maximum peak signal-to-noise ratio in numerical

Journal = {{POLYMER CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},

Pages = {{1510-1516}},
Abstract = {{Polyisoprene (PI) with pendent hydroxyl groups was synthesized by the
   radical copolymerization of isoprene and the hydroxyl containing
   comonomers 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate
   (HEMA), and methylenebut-3-en-1-ol (IOH). The reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) controlled radical
   copolymerizations of isoprene with these comonomers were carried out at
   an initial hydroxyl mole fraction (f(OH)) of 0.03 in the bulk at 125
   degrees C. Aliquots of the polymerizing reaction solution indicated that
   copolymerization competed with the Diels-Alder reaction between the
   hydroxyl monomers and isoprene as well as the Diels-Alder
   homodimerization of isoprene. Significantly more IOH comonomer was
   incorporated into the copolymer (39 mol\%) than either HEMA (23 mol\%)
   or HEA (3 mol\%). Furthermore, IOH polymerized at a rate similar to
   isoprene, which coupled with the slower Diels-Alder reaction resulted in
   hydroxyl functionalized copolymers with a more even distribution of
   comonomers. Additionally, only IOH copolymerized with isoprene under
   emulsion conditions at 25 degrees C due to its limited solubility in
   water. The isoprene/IOH emulsion copolymers had hydroxyl monomer content
   close to fOH at complete monomer conversion. The utility of the hydroxyl
   functionalized PI was demonstrated by using it as a macroinitiator for
   the ring opening polymerization of D, L-lactide, yielding microphase
   separated polylactide graft polymers.}},

Volume = {{39}},

Pages = {{308-325}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we develop a positive theory of network connectivity,
   seeking to provide the microfoundations of alternative network
   topologies as the result of self-interested actors. By building roads,
   landowners hope to increase their parcels' accessibility and economic
   value. A simulation model is performed on a grid-like land-use layer
   with a downtown in the center. The degree to which the networks are
   tree-like is evaluated. This research posits that road networks
   experience an evolutionary process where a tree-like structure first
   emerges around the centered parcel before the network pushes outward to
   the periphery. Road network topology becomes increasingly connected as
   the accessibility value of reaching other parcels increases. The results
   demonstrate that, even without a centralized authority, road networks
   can display the property of self-organization and evolution, and that,
   in the absence of intervention, the degree to which a network structure
   is tree-like or web-like results from the underlying economies.}},

Abstract = {{A comprehensive numerical simulation has been performed to inter-relate
   the fluid mechanics of the formation of co-axial jets and their
   development downstream of the plane of jet emergence. The fluid flow was
   modeled as being turbulent, with corresponding Reynolds numbers in the
   jet-formation section of 10000, 20000, and 50000. The model was based on
   a fully developed pipe flow encountering a double-pipe arrangement and
   splitting between the two pipes. Subsequent to flow development in the
   central pipe and in its enveloping annulus, the flow exited into a large
   free space and became a co-axial free jet. The simulations were
   performed for geometric parameters which varied the relative cross
   sections of the central pipe and of the annulus and also varied the
   length of the jet-formation section. The overall pressure drop
   responsible for both the jet formation and for the subsequent free-jet
   development was found to be due to friction in contradistinction to
   inertial losses. At the jet exit, the velocity profile is discontinuous
   because of the intrusive presence of the walls of the pipes which bound
   the jet-formation section. These intrusions cause a double-humped
   velocity profile which disappeared with decreasing downstream distance
   from the jet origin. At sufficient downstream distances, the width of
   the jet was found to be independent of both the geometrical parameters
   and the Reynolds number.}},

Title = {{Fusegates selection and operation: simulation-optimization approach}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{464-477}},
Abstract = {{Fusegates present a reliable and cost-effective alternative, which
   increase flood protection and water supply benefits. This article
   develops a comprehensive simulation-optimization framework for practical
   selection, installation, and operation of fusegates. The computational
   model simulates the complicated hydraulic behavior of fusegates systems
   with varying design characteristics and consequential anomalous routing
   process in case of flood events. An efficient mixed genetic algorithm
   (GA) is subsequently developed and coupled with the highly nonlinear
   hydraulic simulation model to minimize the overall expected annual cost
   under structural, hydraulic, and operational constraints. Types,
   heights, and tipping heads of gates are explicitly treated as
   optimization decision variables. Furthermore, the frequent practice of
   installing all gates in the same level is practically improved to
   favorably help minimize water loss in case of moderate discharge floods.
   The proposed model is demonstrated and discussed for a case study of the
   Taleghan Dam fusegates installation project in Iran. A series of
   sensitivity analyses are also conducted to assess routing effect and
   uncertainty in water unit price and replacement costs and provide more
   insight and understanding of the design problem.}},

Abstract = {{Porous systems play a significant role in controlled release. Porous
   membranes and matrices can be used to store drug prior to release, and
   pore structure plays a significant role in determining release kinetic
   profiles. In this chapter we review methods used to measure pore
   structure and mathematical models used to relate pore structure to drug
   transport properties. Steric and hydrodynamic interactions between drug
   and pore walls, pore tortuosity, and variation in pore width are
   identified as factors affecting transport. Percolation theory, which
   addresses connectedness of random pore networks and its effect on
   overall releasability of drug and release rate, is discussed. Concepts
   developed for porous systems can be applied, with some modifications, to
   transport in other heterogeneous systems, such as tissue interstitium
   and hydrogels.}},

Pages = {{173-187}},
Abstract = {{This study deals with the development of an optimization-based technique
   for the identification of viscoelastic shear modulus in soft tissue
   specimens using ultrasound radiation force and optical vibrometry
   measurements. In the experiment, a tissue-mimicking phantom is submerged
   in water and excited harmonically via radiation force of modulated
   ultrasound, while the gel's response is monitored (in terms of particle
   velocity) by a laser vibrometer targeting the exposed surface of the
   specimen. For a systematic approach to the problem, the tissue's
   viscoelastic modulus is sought via gradient-based minimization of a
   Bayesian cost function, aided by a boundary integral equation treatment
   of the solid-fluid vibration problem and semi-analytical computation of
   the material sensitivities of the misfit function. Through an
   independent motion tracking of the load transferring component, the
   proposed technique also allows (by way of the reconstructed shear
   modulus) for an independent estimation of the acoustic radiation force
   acting on a target that, depending on a situation, may be difficult to
   measure directly. Beyond their immediate application, the proposed
   developments may also provide an impetus for extensions of the material
   characterization methodology that may involve internal application of
   the acoustic radiation force, vibro-acoustography (as opposed to laser
   vibrometry) observations of the tissue's response and in-vivo estimation
   of tissue viscoelasticity.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{This study presents measurements of size and time-resolved particle
   diameter growth rates for freshly nucleated particles down to 1 nm
   geometric diameter. Novel data analysis methods were developed,
   de-coupling for the first time the size and time-dependence of particle
   growth rates by fitting the aerosol general dynamic equation to size
   distributions obtained at an instant in time. Size distributions of
   freshly nucleated total aerosol (neutral and charged) were measured
   during two intensive measurement campaigns in different environments
   (Atlanta, GA and Boulder, CO) using a recently developed electrical
   mobility spectrometer with a diethylene glycol-based ultrafine
   condensation particle counter as the particle detector. One new particle
   formation (NPF) event from each campaign was analyzed in detail. At a
   given instant in time during the NPF event, size-resolved growth rates
   were obtained directly from measured size distributions and were found
   to increase approximately linearly with particle size from similar to 1
   to 3 nm geometric diameter, increasing from 5.5 +/- 0.8 to 7.6 +/- 0.6
   nm h(-1) in Atlanta (13:00) and from 5.6 +/- 2 to 27 +/- 5 nm h(-1) in
   Boulder (13:00). The resulting growth rate enhancement Gamma, defined as
   the ratio of the observed growth rate to the growth rate due to the
   condensation of sulfuric acid only, was found to increase approximately
   linearly with size from similar to 1 to 3 nm geometric diameter. For the
   presented NPF events, values for Gamma had lower limits that approached
   similar to 1 at 1.2 nm geometric diameter in Atlanta and similar to 3 at
   0.8 nm geometric diameter in Boulder, and had upper limits that reached
   8.3 at 4.1 nm geometric diameter in Atlanta and 25 at 2.7 nm geometric
   diameter in Boulder. Nucleated particle survival probability
   calculations comparing the effects of constant and size-dependent growth
   indicate that neglecting the strong dependence of growth rate on size
   from 1 to 3 nm observed in this study could lead to a significant
   overestimation of CCN survival probability.}},

   the Nusselt number. The geometric variable parameter is the diameter
   ratio d/D (ratio of inner diameters of the inner and outer pipes). Other
   dependent parameters are dimensionless jet-to-impingement plate distance
   (H/D), Reynolds number (Re), and dimensionless radial distance (r/D).
   Local, average, and stagnation-point Nusselt numbers were found as the
   results of heat transfer analysis. It was found that local, average, and
   stagnation-point heat transfer with d/D attained a maximum at d/D =
   0.55. For d/D = 0.55 and 0.35, for a given Reynolds number (10,000,

Abstract = {{The problem of calculating the effective conductivity of isotropic
   composite materials with periodic or random arrangements of spherical
   particles is revisited by using the equivalent inhomogeneity method. The
   approach can be viewed as an extension of classical Maxwell's
   methodology. It is based on the idea that the effective conductivity of
   the composite material can be deduced from the effect of the cluster
   embedded in an infinite space on the far-fields. The key point of the
   approach is to precisely account for the interactions between all the
   particles in the cluster that represent the composite material in
   question. It is done by using a complete, multipole-type analytical
   solution for the problem of an infinite isotropic matrix containing a
   finite cluster of isotropic spherical particles, regarded as the finite
   cluster model of particulate composite. The effective conductivity of
   the composite is evaluated by applying the ``singular-to-singular{''}
   re-expansion formulae and comparing the far-field asymptotic behavior
   with the equivalent inhomogeneity solution. The model allows one to
   adequately capture the influence of the micro-structure of composite
   material on its overall properties.
   Numerical realization of the method is simple and straightforward.
   Comparison of the numerical results obtained by the proposed approach
   with those available in literature (both for periodic and random
   arrangements) demonstrate its accuracy and numerical efficiency.}},

Title = {{Mechanical Behavior of Collagen-Fibrin Co-Gels Reflects Transition From

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Abstract = {{Fibrin and collagen, biopolymers occurring naturally in the body, are
   biomaterials commonly-used as scaffolds for tissue engineering. How
   collagen and fibrin interact to confer macroscopic mechanical properties
   in collagen-fibrin composite systems remains poorly understood. In this
   study, we formulated collagen-fibrin co-gels at different
   collagen-to-fibrin ratios to observe changes in the overall mechanical
   behavior and microstructure. A modeling framework of a two-network
   system was developed by modifying our micro-scale model, considering two
   forms of interaction between the networks: (a) two interpenetrating but
   noninteracting networks ({''}parallel{''}), and (b) a single network
   consisting of randomly alternating collagen and fibrin fibrils
   ({''}series{''}). Mechanical testing of our gels show that
   collagen-fibrin co-gels exhibit intermediate properties (UTS, strain at
   failure, tangent modulus) compared to those of pure collagen and fibrin.
   The comparison with model predictions show that the parallel and series
   model cases provide upper and lower bounds, respectively, for the
   experimental data, suggesting that a combination of such interactions

Abstract = {{Capturing mutation patterns of each individual influenza virus sequence
   is often challenging; in this paper, we demonstrated that using a binary
   encoding scheme coupled with dimension reduction technique, we were able
   to capture the intrinsic mutation pattern of the virus. Our approach
   looks at the variance between sequences instead of the commonly used
   p-distance or Hamming distance. We first convert the influenza genetic
   sequences to a binary strings and form a binary sequence alignment
   matrix and then apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to this matrix.
   PCA also provides identification power to identify reassortant virus by
   using data projection technique. Due to the sparsity of the binary
   string, we were able to analyze large volume of influenza sequence data
   in a very short time. For protein sequences, our scheme also allows the
   incorporation of biophysical properties of each amino acid. Here, we
   present various encouraging results from analyzing influenza nucleotide,
   protein and genome sequences using the proposed approach.}},

Pages = {{87-107}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we propose an efficient method for solving the spherically
   constrained homogeneous polynomial optimization problem. The new
   approach has the following three main ingredients. First, we establish a
   block coordinate descent type search method for nonlinear optimization,
   with the novelty being that we accept only a block update that achieves
   the maximum improvement, hence the name of our new search method:
   maximum block improvement (MBI). Convergence of the sequence produced by
   the MBI method to a stationary point is proved. Second, we establish
   that maximizing a homogeneous polynomial over a sphere is equivalent to
   its tensor relaxation problem; thus we can maximize a homogeneous
   polynomial function over a sphere by its tensor relaxation via the MBI
   approach. Third, we propose a scheme to reach a KKT point of the
   polynomial optimization, provided that a stationary solution for the
   relaxed tensor problem is available. Numerical experiments have shown
   that our new method works very efficiently: for a majority of the test
   instances that we have experimented with, the method finds the global
   optimal solution at a low computational cost.}},

Title = {{Real-time estimation of arterial travel time under congested conditions}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTMETRICA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{87-104}},
Abstract = {{It is well-known that accurate estimation of arterial travel time on
   signalised arterials is not an easy task because of the periodic
   disruption on traffic flow by signal lights. It becomes even more
   difficult when the signal links are congested with long queues because
   under such situations the queue length cannot be estimated using the
   traditional cumulative input-output curves. In this article, we extend
   the virtual probe model previously proposed by the authors to estimate
   arterial travel time with congested links. Specifically, we introduce a
   new queue length estimation method that can handle long queues. The
   queue length defined in this article includes both the standing queue,
   i.e. the motionless stacked vehicles behind the stop line, and the
   moving queue, i.e. those vehicles joining the discharging traffic after
   the last vehicle in the standing queue starts to move. The moving queue
   concept is important for the virtual probe method because moving queue
   also influences the manoeuvre behaviour of a virtual probe. We show
   that, using the `event' data (including both time-stamped signal phase
   changes and vehicle-detector actuations) collected from traffic signal
   systems, time-dependent queue length (including both standing queue and
   moving queue) can be derived by examining the changes in an advance
   detector's occupancy profile within a cycle. The effectiveness of the
   improved virtual probe model for estimating arterial travel time under
   congested conditions is demonstrated through a field study at an
   11-intersection corridor along France Avenue in Minneapolis, MN.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of a commercial mobile tub-grinder {[}463 kW (630 hp)] was
   studied to produce coarsely ground particles from round-baled, plastic
   net-wrapped corn stover and native perennial grasses. The effects of
   grinder screen opening size {[}25.4 to 127.0 mm (1.0 to 5.0 in.)] and
   feedstock type on ground particle size, bulk density of ground biomass,
   throughput, specific energy consumption, and cost of grinding were
   studied. The bulk density of ground biomass ranged from 69 to 207
   kg/m(3) with the moisture content of particles ranging from 14\% to 39\%
   (w.b.). The throughput of the grinder ranged from 6 to 45 t/h. The
   specific energy consumption ranged from 93 to 661 MJ/t. The estimated
   cost of grinding ranged from \$4.39 to \$31.23/t. Increasing the grinder
   screen opening size increased the ground particle size and throughput,
   but decreased the bulk density of ground biomass, specific energy
   consumption, and cost of grinding. High moisture bales (>= 25\% w.b.)
   decreased the performance of the grinder The results from this study
   would be useful for developing a biomass supply logistics system
   involving mobile grinding.}},

Abstract = {{Low profile cross-ventilated freestall (CV) and compost bedded pack
   barns (CB) are two newer housing options for dairy producers in the
   Upper Midwest. The CV barns are fully enclosed facilities that rely on
   mechanical ventilation and typically use evaporative cooling for heat
   abatement during the warmer months. The CB barns are a loose housing
   system that is generally bedded with dry wood sawdust and tilled twice
   daily. The objectives of this study were to describe the housing system
   and assess air quality (aerial ammonia and hydrogen sulfide), air
   velocity, light intensity, temperature, and relative humidity in CV CB,
   and naturally ventilated freestall barns (NV). This cohort study was
   conducted on 18 commercial dairy farms, 6 of each housing type, in
   Minnesota and eastern South Dakota. Farms were visited four times, once
   each season between January and November 2008. Ammonia, hydrogen
   sulfide, light intensity, and air velocity measurements were taken twice
   each visit with 10 measurements per sampling time. Aerial ammonia
   concentrations were significantly higher in CV barns than CB and NV
   barns (5.2, 3.9, and 3.3 ppm, respectively). Hydrogen sulfide
   concentrations were 18, 33, and 19 ppb in CB, CV and NV barns,
   respectively. There was a trend for higher hydrogen sulfide
   concentrations in CV barns. Light intensity was significantly lower in
   CV barns than CB and NV barns (111, 480, and 392 lux, respectively).
   There were no differences in air velocity among the housing systems. The
   mechanically ventilated CV barns were warmer in the fall and winter than
   the CB and NV barns. When outside temperature was above 27 degrees C, CV
   barns were 2.9 degrees C and 3.0 degrees C cooler than CB and NV barns,
   respectively. No differences were seen in bedding or bulk tank bacterial
   counts among the housing systems. Although CV barns had significantly
   higher aerial ammonia and a trend for higher hydrogen sulfide
   concentrations than NV and CB barns, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide
   concentrations were below the threshold that would affect cow
   performance or human health. In conclusion, the three housing systems
   assessed had adequate air quality and ventilation to provide a safe
   environment for workers and animals.}},

   standards and data structure to facilitate high quality long-term
   observations of atmospheric particle number size distributions}},

Abstract = {{Mobility particle size spectrometers often referred to as DMPS
   (Differential Mobility Particle Sizers) or SMPS (Scanning Mobility
   Particle Sizers) have found a wide range of applications in atmospheric
   aerosol research. However, comparability of measurements conducted
   world-wide is hampered by lack of generally accepted technical standards
   and guidelines with respect to the instrumental set-up, measurement
   mode, data evaluation as well as quality control. Technical standards
   were developed for a minimum requirement of mobility size spectrometry
   to perform long-term atmospheric aerosol measurements. Technical
   recommendations include continuous monitoring of flow rates,
   temperature, pressure, and relative humidity for the sheath and sample
   air in the differential mobility analyzer.
   We compared commercial and custom-made inversion routines to calculate
   the particle number size distributions from the measured electrical
   mobility distribution. All inversion routines are comparable within few
   per cent uncertainty for a given set of raw data.
   Furthermore, this work summarizes the results from several instrument
   intercomparison workshops conducted within the European infrastructure
   project EUSAAR (European Supersites for Atmospheric Aerosol Research)
   and ACTRIS (Aerosols, Clouds, and Trace gases Research InfraStructure
   Network) to determine present uncertainties especially of custom-built
   mobility particle size spectrometers. Under controlled laboratory
   conditions, the particle number size distributions from 20 to 200 nm
   determined by mobility particle size spectrometers of different design
   are within an uncertainty range of around +/- 10\% after correcting
   internal particle losses, while below and above this size range the
   discrepancies increased. For particles larger than 200 nm, the
   uncertainty range increased to 30\%, which could not be explained. The
   network reference mobility spectrometers with identical design agreed
   within +/- 4\% in the peak particle number concentration when all
   settings were done carefully. The consistency of these reference
   instruments to the total particle number concentration was demonstrated
   to be less than 5\%.
   Additionally, a new data structure for particle number size
   distributions was introduced to store and disseminate the data at EMEP
   (European Monitoring and Evaluation Program). This structure contains
   three levels: raw data, processed data, and final particle size
   distributions. Importantly, we recommend reporting raw measurements
   including all relevant instrument parameters as well as a complete
   documentation on all data transformation and correction steps. These
   technical and data structure standards aim to enhance the quality of
   long-term size distribution measurements, their comparability between
   different networks and sites, and their transparency and traceability
   back to raw data.}},

Abstract = {{This study was conducted to determine if engineered nanoparticles are
   released into the air when nanocomposite parts are shredded for
   recycling. Test plaques made from polypropylene resin reinforced with
   either montmorillonite nanoclay or talc and from the same resin with no
   reinforcing material were shredded by a granulator inside a test
   apparatus. As the plaques were shredded, an ultrafine condensation
   particle counter; a diffusion charger; a photometer; an electrical
   mobility analyzer; and an optical particle counter measured number
   lung-deposited surface area, and mass concentrations and size
   distributions by number in real-time. Overall, the particle levels
   produced were both stable and lower than found in some occupational
   environments. Although the lowest particle concentrations were observed
   when the talc-filled plaques were shredded, fewer nanoparticles were
   generated from the nanocomposite plaques than when the plain resin
   plaques were shredded. For example, the average particle number
   concentrations measured using the ultrafine condensation particle
   counter were 1300 particles/cm(3) for the talc-reinforced resin, 4280
   particles/cm(3) for the nanoclay-reinforced resin, and 12,600
   particles/cm(3) for the plain resin. Similarly, the average
   alveolar-deposited particle surface area concentrations measured using
   the diffusion charger were 4.0 mu m(2)/cm(3) for the talc-reinforced
   resin, 8.5 mu m(2)/cm(3) for the nanoclay-reinforced resin, and 26 mu
   m(2)/cm(3) for the plain resin. For all three materials, count median
   diameters were near 10 nm during tests, which is smaller than should be
   found from the reinforcing materials. These findings suggest that
   recycling of nanoclay-reinforced plastics does not have a strong
   potential to generate more airborne nanoparticles than recycling of
   conventional plastics.}},

Abstract = {{A hybrid computational framework consisting of Eulerian boundary zone
   concept augmented to Lagrangian finite element formulations with moving

   This is in conjunction with a novel L-stable time discretized framework

   computationally attractive features for practical problems. The L-stable
   algorithm is developed and implemented and is of second order accuracy
   and modified for nonlinear dynamic systems with frictional contact
   boundaries. No nonlinear iterations are necessary for the nonlinear

   The proposed method is suitable for steady state problems with complex

Abstract = {{With the aim to understand the relatively high solubility of
   1,3,5-triamino-2,4,6-trinitrobenzene (TATB), an important energetic
   material with a high degree of inter-and intra-molecular hydrogen
   bonding, in fluoride anion containing ionic liquids (ILs), first
   principles molecular dynamics simulations in the isobaric-isothermal
   ensemble were carried out for a system using hydrous tetramethylammonium
   fluoride as the prototypical solvent. Simulations initiated from both
   molecular TATB and its Meisenheimer complex (i.e., a sigma-complex of
   the fluoride and the electrophilic ring of TATB) yield a Zundel-type
   complex where a proton is shared between an amino group and an F- ion,
   whereas the Meisenheimer complex is found to be only transiently stable.
   An analysis of the electronic structure probing the Wannier function
   centers supports the finding of a proton-sharing complex with a
   three-center four-electron like bond. The Zundel-type complex also
   yields an electronic absorption spectrum consistent with the
   experimentally observed color change. This study provides evidence that
   the remarkable solubility of otherwise hard-to-dissolve molecular
   crystals in ILs can be aided by chemical modification of the solute.}},

Title = {{Dictionary Learning for Noisy and Incomplete Hyperspectral Images}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON IMAGING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{33-56}},
Abstract = {{We consider analysis of noisy and incomplete hyperspectral imagery, with
   the objective of removing the noise and inferring the missing data. The
   noise statistics may be wavelength dependent, and the fraction of data
   missing (at random) may be substantial, including potentially entire
   bands, offering the potential to significantly reduce the quantity of
   data that need be measured. To achieve this objective, the imagery is
   divided into contiguous three-dimensional (3D) spatio-spectral blocks of
   spatial dimension much less than the image dimension. It is assumed that
   each such 3D block may be represented as a linear combination of
   dictionary elements of the same dimension, plus noise, and the
   dictionary elements are learned in situ based on the observed data (no a
   priori training). The number of dictionary elements needed for
   representation of any particular block is typically small relative to
   the block dimensions, and all the image blocks are processed jointly
   ({''}collaboratively{''}) to infer the underlying dictionary. We address
   dictionary learning from a Bayesian perspective, considering two
   distinct means of imposing sparse dictionary usage. These models allow
   inference of the number of dictionary elements needed as well as the
   underlying wavelength-dependent noise statistics. It is demonstrated
   that drawing the dictionary elements from a Gaussian process prior,
   imposing structure on the wavelength dependence of the dictionary
   elements, yields significant advantages, relative to the more
   conventional approach of using an independent and identically
   distributed Gaussian prior for the dictionary elements; this advantage
   is particularly evident in the presence of noise. The framework is
   demonstrated by processing hyperspectral imagery with a significant
   number of voxels missing uniformly at random, with imagery at specific
   wavelengths missing entirely, and in the presence of substantial
   additive noise.}},

Abstract = {{The consequences on certain physical properties of controlled levels of
   epoxidation of the poly(isoprene) blocks in poly(styrene-b-isoprene)
   (PS-PI) diblock copolymers and poly(isoprene) (hPI) homopolymers have
   been studied, where the products after epoxidation are denoted PS-PIxn
   and hPIxn, respectively. The effective interaction parameters chi(eff)
   between the PS and the PIxn blocks were estimated by applying mean-field
   theory to the lamellar periodicities identified by small-angle X-ray
   scattering and to the order-to-disorder transition temperatures
   determined by dynamic mechanical spectroscopy, These results were fit to
   a binary segment-segment interaction parameter model indicating a
   nonlinear change in chi(eff) with percent epoxidation. In contrast,
   contact angle measurement on hPIxn and lamellar orientations of
   thin-film PS-PIxn suggest that the surface energy of PIxn increases

Abstract = {{The bulk ring-opening polymerization of renewable delta-decalactone
   using 1,5,7-triazabicyclo{[}4.4.0]dec-5-ene was carried out at
   temperatures between 7 and 110 degrees C. The equilibrium monomer
   concentration for reactions within this temperature range was used to
   determine the polymerization thermodynamic parameters (Delta H-p = -17.1
   +/- 0.6 kJ mol(-1), Delta S-p = -54 +/- 2 J mol(-1) K-1) for
   delta-decalactone. The polymerization kinetics were established and high
   molar mass poly(delta-decalactone) was prepared with a glass transition
   temperature of -51 degrees C. Poly(delta-decalactone) samples with
   controlled molar mass and narrow molar mass distributions were realized
   by controlling the monomer conversion and initiator concentration. A
   high molar mass poly(lactide)-poly(delta-decalactone)-poly(lactide)
   triblock copolymer with a low polydispersity index was prepared by
   simple sequential addition of monomers. The product triblock exhibited
   two distinct glass transitions temperatures consistent with microphase

Abstract = {{We present the design and implementation of an oxidized silicon
   ``nanofence array'' for long DNA electrophoresis. The device consists of
   a periodic array of post-filled regions (the nanofences) alternating
   with empty channel regions. Even in this prototype version, the
   nanofence array provides the resolving power of a hexagonal nanopost
   array without requiring any direct-write nanopatterning steps such as
   electron-beam lithography. Through detailed single molecule
   investigations, we demonstrate that the origin of the resolving power of
   the nanofence array is not a reduction in band broadening, which might
   be expected from the theories for DNA electrophoresis in post arrays.
   Rather, the enhanced stretching of the hooked DNA by the uniform
   electric field between nanofences increases the efficiency of the
   collisions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we consider the problem of maximizing a separable concave
   function over a polymatroid. More specifically, we study the
   submodularity of its optimal objective value in the parameters of the
   objective function. This question is interesting in its own right and is
   encountered in many applications. But our research has been motivated
   mainly by a cooperative game associated with the well-known joint
   replenishment model. By applying our general results on polymatroid
   optimization, we prove that this cooperative game is submodular (i.e.,
   its characteristic cost function is submodular) if the joint setup cost
   is a normalized and nondecreasing submodular function. Furthermore, the
   same result holds true for a more general one-warehouse multiple
   retailer game, which affirmatively answers an open question posed by
   Anily and Haviv {[}Anily, S., M. Haviv. 2007. The cost allocation

Abstract = {{Polymersomes were functionalized using azide-alkyne ``click{''}
   chemistry with two targeting peptides: GRGDSP and the recently designed
   fibronectin mimetic peptide, PR\_b, which has been shown to bind with
   high specificity to the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin expressed on colon
   cancer cells. The ability of these peptide functionalized polymersomes
   to achieve targeted delivery to colon cancer cells was assessed by
   studying their delivery to CT26. WT and Caco-2 cells in vitro. The
   diblock copolymer poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly (1,2-butadiene) was
   synthesized and self-assembled to form polymersomes, which were
   subsequently functionalized with peptides using a ``click{''}
   conjugation reaction. Drug delivery efficacy of these peptide
   functionalized polymersomes loaded with fluorescent markers or the
   chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin, was assessed and compared. In addition,
   the cell binding and internalization of fluorescently labeled
   polymersomes was imaged using confocal microscopy. PR\_b functionalized
   polymersomes are found to significantly outperform both GRGDSP and
   non-functionalized polymersomes, both in terms of promoting cell binding
   and internalization and doxorubicin cytotoxicity. Moreover, PR\_b
   functionalized polymersomes are found to act as highly target specific
   drug delivery agents, thus highlighting them as a promising model

Title = {{Bipolar Diffusion Charging of Aggregates}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{794-803}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the effect of particle morphology on bipolar diffusion
   charging is studied. A modified tandem differential mobility analyzer
   (TDMA) method used to measure the charge distribution of submicron
   particles in the range of 70-300 nm is described in detail. The method
   requires an independent measurement of the neutral fraction, followed by
   the measurement of the size-dependent charge distribution, which
   requires the knowledge of the neutral fraction. The method was validated
   experimentally using dioctyl sebacate and ammonium sulfate spherical
   particles and compared with Fuchs' theory. Diesel particles and silver
   aggregates were used to evaluate the impact of morphology on charging.
   The results show that aggregates have a slightly lower (about 7\%)
   neutral fraction than spheres. These results are in agreement with the
   predictions of Lall and Friedlander's theory and previous studies.
   However, results from charge distribution indicate that more (about
   46\%) particles are negatively charged than predicted by Lall and
   Friedlander's theory, while 32\% fewer particles are positively charged.
   This relatively large asymmetry between the negative and the positive
   charge fraction is not fully predicted by either Fuchs' or aggregate
   charging theories. Our results suggest that the current inversion method
   of scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) data, based on Fuchs' or Lall
   and Friedlander's distribution, would underestimate the total number
   concentration by about 15\% or 27\% if applied to diesel aggregates.}},

Abstract = {{Al- and In-doped CdSe nanocrystals were synthesized using a three-part
   core-shell synthesis. CdSe core nanocrystals were first prepared, then
   allowed to react with dopant precursors in the presence of weakly
   binding ligands, and finally overcoated with an additional shell of
   CdSe. The addition of Al dopants quickened shell overgrowth and led to
   more monodisperse nanocrystals while the addition of In dopants produced
   more polydisperse particles, as seen by absorption spectroscopy.
   Elemental analysis combined with chemical etching revealed the dopants
   were inside the particles and solid state 27 Al nuclear magnetic
   resonance (NMR) spectra indicated that the Al impurities were well
   dispersed. When the Al-doped nanocrystals were processed into thin-film
   transistors, enhanced n-type transport was observed with a rise in the

Abstract = {{Improvements in the effectiveness of solid phase heat recovery and in
   the thermodynamic properties of metal oxides are the most important
   paths to achieving unprecedented thermal efficiencies of 10\% and higher
   in non-stoichiometric solar redox reactors. In this paper, the impact of
   solid and gas phase heat recovery on the efficiency of a
   non-stoichiometric cerium dioxide-based H2O/CO2 splitting cycle realized
   in a solar-driven reactor are evaluated in a parametric thermodynamic
   analysis. Application of solid phase heat recovery to the cycling metal
   oxide allows for lower reduction zone operating temperatures,
   simplifying reactor design. An optimum temperature for metal oxide
   reduction results from two competing phenomena as the reduction
   temperature is increased: increasing re-radiation losses from the
   reactor aperture and decreasing heat loss due to imperfect solid phase
   heat recovery. Additionally, solid phase heat recovery increases the
   efficiency gains made possible by gas phase heat recovery. (C) 2011

Title = {{In vivo comparison of simultaneous versus sequential injection technique

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},

Volume = {{28}},

Pages = {{105-112}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate simultaneous and sequential injection
   thermochemical ablation in a porcine model, and compare them to sham and
   acid-only ablation.
   Materials and methods: This IACUC-approved study involved 11 pigs in an
   acute setting. Ultrasound was used to guide placement of a thermocouple
   probe and coaxial device designed for thermochemical ablation. Solutions
   of 10M acetic acid and NaOH were used in the study. Four injections per
   pig were performed in identical order at a total rate of 4 mL/min:
   saline sham, simultaneous, sequential, and acid only. Volume and
   sphericity of zones of coagulation were measured. Fixed specimens were
   examined by H\&E stain.
   Results: Average coagulation volumes were 11.2mL (simultaneous), 19.0mL
   (sequential) and 4.4mL (acid). The highest temperature, 81.3 degrees C,
   was obtained with simultaneous injection. Average temperatures were 61.1
   degrees C (simultaneous), 47.7 degrees C (sequential) and 39.5 degrees C
   (acid only). Sphericity coefficients (0.83-0.89) had no statistically
   significant difference among conditions.
   Conclusions: Thermochemical ablation produced substantial volumes of
   coagulated tissues relative to the amounts of reagents injected,
   considerably greater than acid alone in either technique employed. The
   largest volumes were obtained with sequential injection, yet this came
   at a price in one case of cardiac arrest. Simultaneous injection yielded
   the highest recorded temperatures and may be tolerated as well as or
   better than acid injection alone. Although this pilot study did not show
   a clear advantage for either sequential or simultaneous methods, the
   results indicate that thermochemical ablation is attractive for further
   investigation with regard to both safety and efficacy.}},

Title = {{Concentration and volume effects in thermochemical ablation in vivo:
   Results in a porcine model}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HYPERTHERMIA}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{113-121}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To explore the effects of volume and concentration in
   thermochemical ablation using an in vivo porcine model.
   Methods: Twelve swine 60-75 kg were used in this institutionally
   approved study. A needle design prototype coaxial device for reagent
   injections and a thermocouple were inserted into surgically exposed
   liver. Simultaneously, an acid and base (acetic acid and NaOH) were
   injected at 4 mL/min based on a 3 x 3 matrix with concentration (5, 10,
   and 15 mol/L) and volume on the axes (total volumes of 1, 2, and 4 mL).
   Three animals (centre grid position) strengthened the statistical
   analysis. Each animal received four identical injections (total 48).
   Temperatures and heart rate were recorded. Livers were formalin-fixed
   after sacrifice. After sectioning, coagulation zones were analysed by
   two observers. Area and slice thickness were used to calculate the
   volume, surface area, and sphericity for each treatment.
   Results: Coagulation volumes ranged from 2.95 +/- 0.29 to 14.72 +/-
   1.42mL with a maximum of 18.3 mL. Highest peak temperature was 105
   degrees C with temperatures ranging 43.5 +/- 2.6 degrees C to 91.0 +/-
   6.5 degrees C. There was no association between conditions and
   sphericity or heart rate.
   Conclusions: The method can be used successfully to ablate tissue in
   vivo. By neutralising acid in situ and releasing heat and a salt, this
   technique improves considerably upon the use of acetic acid used alone.
   Peak temperatures exceeded accepted coagulation thresholds even if the
   only mechanism operating was hyperthermia. Reagent concentrations and
   volumes increased the amount of the coagulum but not in a linear
   fashion.}},

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{2}},

Pages = {{2527-2533}},
Abstract = {{Catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of isobutanol to produce synthesis gas
   with varying H-2/CO ratios has been performed autothermally in a staged
   millisecond-contact-time reactor. A 1 wt\% Rh-1 wt\% Ce/alpha-alumina
   catalyst was used to carry out CPO of isobutanol over a range of fuel to
   oxygen ratios (C/O) in similar to 20 ms residence times. Steam was added
   (S/C = 0 to S/C = 3) to promote the water gas shift (WGS) reaction and
   increase hydrogen production. Without steam addition, the maximum CO and
   H-2 selectivities obtained were greater than 70\%. Steam addition
   increased the maximum hydrogen selectivity to 103\%, at C/O = 1 and S/C
   = 2. Conversion of isobutanol and oxygen was always > 99\% at all C/O
   and S/C ratios after CPO where the autothermal temperatures were
   typically between 600 and 1000 degrees C. A 1 wt\% Pt-1 wt\% Ce catalyst
   was added downstream of the CPO stage to further reduce the CO and
   increase the H-2 concentrations by the WGS reaction. Addition of the WGS
   stage resulted in a product stream containing 1.7 to 3 mol\% CO at S/C
   of 2 and 3 which is comparable to the exit stream CO concentration of an
   industrial high temperature shift catalyst. With steam addition,
   selectivities to hydrogen greater than 100\% were obtained at all C/O
   ratios, with a maximum of 122\% at C/O = 0.9 and S/C = 3. At S/C = 3,
   the H-2/CO ratio increased from similar to 3 after the CPO stage to
   similar to 12 after the WGS stage. Also, the WGS catalyst reduced the
   selectivities of non-equilibrium products like isobutylene and
   isobutyraldehyde by almost half compared to that after the CPO stage,
   which can reduce syngas cleanup costs after a reformer. Since the total
   residence time in the reactor is similar to 100 ms and the product
   distribution can be tuned by addition of steam, this represents a
   compact and simple system for producing renewable syngas or hydrogen.}},

   match the action of the system matrix on a given vector, typically the
   constant vector. Here, we examine the role of similar modifications
   within the dual-threshold ILUT algorithm. We introduce column and row
   variants of the modified ILUT algorithm and discuss optimal ways of
   modifying the columns or rows of the computed factors to improve their
   accuracy and stability. Modifications are considered for both the
   diagonal and off-diagonal entries of the factors, based on one or many
   vectors, chosen a priori or through an Arnoldi iteration. Numerical
   results are presented to support our findings.}},

Title = {{Hierarchical microphase separation in bicontinuous ternary polymer
   blends}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},

Pages = {{3429-3441}},
Abstract = {{We describe the phase behavior of a ternary blend of
   poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) (P), poly
   (cyclohexylethylene-b-ethylene-b-cyclohexylethylene) (CEC), and a
   CECEC-P amphiphilic hexablock where both CEC and CECEC-P are ordered in
   the bulk. In this system, designed to mimic A/B/A-B ternary polymer
   blends, CEC and P were mixed with CECEC-P along the 50 : 50 CEC/P
   volumetric isopleth, and the phase behavior of select blend compositions
   was probed with a combination of rheology, SANS, TEM and SEM. At low
   volume fractions of CECEC-P and above the T-ODT of CEC, the phase
   behavior is very similar to that of A/B/A-B systems, with a progression
   from swollen lamellae to microemulsion phases. Cooling through the T-ODT
   of CEC yields a striking change in morphology, precipitating a
   transition to microemulsion phases at a broader range of blend
   compositions. Within the CEC-rich domain of such a bicontinuous
   microemulsion, we identify alternating C-E lamellae which are oriented
   perpendicularly to the CEC/P interface. SEM images of porous templates
   of this phase created by selective removal of P confirm the bicontinuous
   structure. The mechanical properties of these templates are poor due to
   the alignment of C-E lamellae across the CEC-rich domain. These results
   illustrate the generalizability of A/B/A-B ternary blend phase behavior
   to significantly more complex linear architectures containing multiple
   ordering transitions, and offer a route for templating functional
   multiblock copolymers with the bicontinuous microemulsion morphology.}},

Abstract = {{In this chapter, we explore how different common ionic currents change
   the shape of the PRC using several well-known conductance-based models.
   By also studying the simplest possible network - two pulse coupled
   neural oscillators we can use the shape of the PRC to quantify the
   degree of synchrony in such a pair. We find a number of qualitative
   effects that include changing the sign of the PRC during certain phases
   and altering the skew of the PRC. Using bifurcation theory, we trace
   these effects back to the underlying dynamics that govern the onset of
   repetitive firing as the neuron is depolarized by a constant current.
   The key bifurcation involves the so-called Takens-Bogdanov bifurcation.
   We show that many of the shape changes of the PRC can be understood by
   examining the dynamics of the neuron near this bifurcation.}},

Title = {{Reynolds number effects on scale energy balance in wall turbulence}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The scale energy budget utilizes a modified version of the classical
   Kolmogorov equation of wall turbulence to develop an evolution equation
   for the second order structure function {[}R. J. Hill, ``Exact
   second-order structure-function relationships,{''} J. Fluid Mech. 468,
   317 (2002)]. This methodology allows for the simultaneous
   characterization of the energy cascade and spatial fluxes in turbulent
   shear flows across the entire physical domain as well as the range of
   scales. The present study utilizes this methodology to characterize the
   effects of Reynolds number on the balance of energy fluxes in turbulent
   channel flows. Direct numerical simulation data in the range Re-tau =
   300-934 are compared to previously published results at Re-tau = 180
   {[}N. Marati, C. M. Casciola, and R. Piva, ``Energy cascade and spatial
   fluxes in wall turbulence,{''} J. Fluid Mech. 521, 191 (2004)]. The
   present results show no Reynolds number effects in the terms of the
   scale energy budget in either the viscous sublayer or buffer regions of
   the channel. In the logarithmic layer, the transfer of energy across
   scales clearly varies with Reynolds number, while the production of
   turbulent kinetic energy is not dependent on Reynolds number. An
   envelope of inverse energy cascade is quantified in the buffer region
   within which energy is transferred from small to larger scales. This
   envelope is observed in the range 6 < y(+) < 37, where all scales except
   the smallest scales display characteristics of an inverse energy
   cascade. The cross-over scale l(c)(+), which indicates the transition
   between production dominated and scale transfer dominated regimes,
   increases with Reynolds number, implying a larger range of transfer
   dominated scales, before the dominant mechanism switches to production.
   At higher Reynolds numbers, two distinct regimes of l(c)(+). as a
   function of wall-normal location are observed, which was not captured at
   Re-tau = 180. The variations of l(c)(+) match the trends of the shear
   scale, which is a representation of the mean shear in the flow. Thus,
   this study demonstrates the utility and importance of the use of higher
   Reynolds number data in order to accurately characterize and understand
   the energy dynamics of various scales across the entire boundary layer.

Abstract = {{With the advent of multicore systems, the gap between processor speed

   describes an optimization that aims to improve heap data layout by
   structure-splitting. It also provides runtime address checking by
   piggybacking on the existing page protection mechanism to guarantee the
   correctness of such optimization that has eluded many previous attempts
   due to safety concerns. The technique can be applied to both sequential
   and parallel programs at either compile time or runtime. However, we
   focus primarily on sequential programs (i.e., single-threaded programs)
   at runtime in this paper. Experimental results show that some benchmarks

Abstract = {{Ethylene and propylene methylation rates increased linearly with olefin
   pressure but did not depend on dimethyl ether (DME) pressures on
   proton-form FER, MFI, MOR, and BEA zeolites at low conversions (<0.2\%)
   and high DME/olefin ratios (30:1) in accordance with a mechanism that
   involves the zeolite surface being predominantly covered by DME-derived
   species reacting with olefins. Higher first-order reaction rate
   constants for both ethylene and propylene methylation were observed over
   H-BEA and H-MFI compared with H-FER and H-MOR, indicating that olefin
   methylation reaction cycles involved in the conversion of
   methanol-to-gasoline over zeolitic acids are propagated to varying
   extents by different framework materials. Systematically lower
   activation barriers and higher rate constants were observed for
   propylene methylation in comparison with ethylene methylation over all
   frameworks studied, reflecting the increased stability of reaction
   intermediates and activated complexes with increasing olefin
   substitution. A binomial distribution of d(0)/d(3)/d(6) in unreacted DME
   upon introduction of equimolar protium- and deuterium-form DME under
   steady-state reaction conditions of ethylene methylation over H-MFI
   suggests the presence and facile formation of reactive surface-bound
   methoxide species and the absence of C-H bond cleavage. (C) 2011

Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we do a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser diversity in
   single antenna broadcast channels. It is well known that the multiuser
   diversity can be beneficial but there is a significant cost in terms of
   system resources, bandwidth and power associated with acquiring
   instantaneous CSI. We work out a cost-benefit analysis of multiuser
   diversity for 2 types of CSI feedback methods, dedicated feedback and
   SNR dependent feedback, quantifying how many users should feedback CSI
   i.e the amount of available multiuser diversity that should be used from
   a net throughput perspective. Dedicated feedback, in which orthogonal
   resources are allocated to each user, has significant feedback cost and
   this limits the amount of available multiuser diversity that can be
   used. SNR dependent feedback method, in which only users with SNR above
   a threshold attempt to feedback, has relatively much smaller feedback
   cost and this allows for all of the available multiuser diversity to be
   used. Next, we study the effect of single user multiantenna techniques,
   which reduce the SNR variation, on the number of feedback users. It is
   seen that a broadcast channel using single user multiantenna techniques
   should reduce the number of feedback users with the spatial dimension.}},

Abstract = {{The identification of small potent compounds that selectively bind to
   the target under consideration with high affinities is a critical step
   toward successful drug discovery. However, there is still a lack of
   efficient and accurate computational methods to predict compound
   selectivity properties. In this paper, we propose a set of machine
   learning methods to do compound selectivity prediction. In particular,
   we propose a novel cascaded learning method and a multitask learning
   method. The cascaded method decomposes the selectivity prediction into
   two steps, one model for each step, so as to effectively filter out
   nonselective compounds. The multitask method incorporates both activity
   and selectivity models into one multitask model so as to better
   differentiate compound selectivity properties. We conducted a
   comprehensive set of experiments and compared the results with those of
   other conventional selectivity prediction methods, and our results
   demonstrated that the cascaded and multitask methods significantly
   improve the selectivity prediction performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new probability distribution function for the
   breakdown lifetime of high-k gate dielectrics under unipolar AC voltage
   stress. This function is derived from a finite weakest-link model, where
   the gate oxide layer is considered to consist of many potential
   breakdown cells. Each potential breakdown cell is modeled as a series
   coupling of several subcells, which is analogous to the fiber-bundle
   model for the strength statistics of structures. The present model
   indicates that the type of lifetime distribution varies with the gate
   area and the dependence of the mean lifetime on the gate area deviates
   from the classical Weibull scaling law. iris shown that the model agrees
   well with the observed lifetime histograms of HfO2 based gate
   dielectrics under unipolar AC voltage stress. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Effects of component molecular weight on the viscoelastic properties of
   thermoreversible supramolecular ion gels via hydrogen bonding}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{2110-2120}},
Abstract = {{We describe a thermoreversible supramolecular ion gel system consisting
   of a poly(2-vinylpyridine-b-ethylene oxide-b-2-vinylpyridine)
   (P2VP-PEO-P2VP) triblock copolymer, a poly(4-vinylphenol) (PVPh) linear
   homopolymer, and a room-temperature ionic liquid,
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl) amide
   ({[}EMI]{[}TFSA]). Aggregates of intermolecularly hydrogen-bonded PVPh
   cross-linkers form cross-links, connecting P2VP-PEO-P2VP triblock chains
   into a transient polymer network through hydrogen bonding with the P2VP
   endblocks. The viscoelastic properties of the resulting gels are
   strongly temperature-dependent, as manifested by the 15 orders of
   magnitude variation in the longest relaxation time (tau(1)) from the gel
   temperature (T-gel) down to room temperature. Wide temperature-and
   frequency-independent rubbery plateaus are distinct, indicating the
   formation of a well-defined network structure. The applicability of
   time-temperature superposition to this system is striking, suggesting
   the invariance of the underlying relaxation mechanism. The terminal
   relaxation dynamics of these hydrogen-bonded supramolecular networks is
   dramatically retarded upon increasing the P2VP endblock length. In
   contrast, their viscoelastic properties are relatively insensitive to
   the PVPh cross-linker length. These results are consistent with the
   hypothesis that tau(1) is determined by the average lifetime of a P2VP
   <-> PVPh association, which is directly related to the number of
   hydrogen bonds involved. Besides their potential applications in various
   electrochemical devices, these materials might also be used in surface
   coatings, where thermally reversible and sensitive viscoelastic
   properties are highly advantageous.}},

Abstract = {{Although time-domain oversampling of the received baseband signal is
   common for single-carrier transmissions, the counterpart of
   frequency-domain oversampling is rarely used for multicarrier
   transmissions. This is because frequency-domain oversampling cannot be
   taken advantage of, when using the commonly used low-complexity receiver
   that assumes orthogonal subcarriers. In this paper, we explore
   frequency-domain oversampling to improve the system performance of
   zero-padded (ZP) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)
   transmissions over underwater acoustic channels with large Doppler
   spread. In these channels, intercarrier interference (ICI) has to be
   addressed explicitly via frequency-domain equalization, which enables
   inclusion of additional frequency samples at little increased
   complexity. We use a signal design that enables separate sparse channel
   estimation and data detection, reducing equalization complexity. Based
   on both simulation and experimental results, we observe that the
   receiver with frequency-domain oversampling outperforms the conventional
   one considerably, where the gain increases as the Doppler spread
   increases.}},

Abstract = {{A compelling vision in nanomedicine is the use of self directed

   are increasingly achieved by gold nanoparticles (GNPs, such as sphere,
   shell or rod) that can be activated with a laser ``switch{''}. A
   defining aspect of this ``switch{''} is GNP absorption of laser light
   and the ensuing heat generation and temperature change that can be
   confined or propagated through multiple scales from the nanoparticle
   surface up through bulk biological cells and tissues. In this critical
   review, we discuss the fundamental mechanisms of laser GNP heat
   generation, the measurement and modelling of the ensuing thermal
   response, and a number of the evolving biological applications dependent
   on this new technology (181 references).}},

Abstract = {{We present a model for determining the threshold voltage of field-effect
   transistors with nanocrystalline active channel layers. In this type of
   device, the multiple boundaries between neighboring crystalline grains
   limit the charge-carrier transport. Electrons in the channel may either
   populate the conduction band within a grain or be trapped at an
   interface between neighboring grains. The relative distribution of the
   electrons over these states determines the conductances of the grains
   and of the boundaries between them. We employ simple carrier statistics
   to calculate the macroscopic densities of free and trapped carriers, and
   these densities are then used to define site and bond occupation
   probabilities for a two-dimensional site-bond percolation problem. The
   dependence of the threshold voltage on the primary model parameters: the
   energy of the trap states, the total density of traps, and the
   temperature, is explored. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering sustains the need of a three-dimensional (3D)
   scaffold to promote the regeneration of tissues in volume. Usually,
   scaffolds are seeded with an adequate cell population, allowing their
   growth and maturation upon implantation in vivo. Previous studies
   obtained by our group evidenced significant growth patterns and
   osteogenic differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells
   (hBMSCs) when seeded and cultured on melt-based porous chitosan fibre
   mesh scaffolds (cell constructs). Therefore, it is crucial to test the
   in vivo performance of these in vitro 3D cell constructs. In this study,
   chitosan-based scaffolds were seeded and cultured in vitro with hBMSCs
   for 3 weeks under osteogenic stimulation conditions and analysed for
   cell adhesion, proliferation and differentiation. Implantation of 2
   weeks precultured cell constructs in osteogenic culture conditions was
   performed into critical cranial size defects in nude mice. The objective
   of this study was to verify the scaffold integration and new bone
   formation. At 8 weeks of implantation, scaffolds were harvested and
   prepared for micro-computed tomography (mu CT) analysis. Retrieved
   implants showed good integration with the surrounding tissue and
   significant bone formation, more evident for the scaffolds cultured and
   implanted with human cells. The results of this work demonstrated that
   chitosan-based scaffolds, besides supporting in vitro proliferation and
   osteogenic differentiation of hBMSCs, induced bone formation in vivo.
   Thus, their osteogenic potential in orthotopic location in
   immunodeficient mice was validated, evidencing good prospects for their
   use in bone tissue-engineering therapies. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Aluminum-doped ZnO films were prepared by atomic layer deposition at 250
   degrees C using diethylzinc (DEZ), trimethylaluminum (TMA), and ozone as
   the precursors. Two deposition methods were compared to assess their
   impact on the composition, structural, electrical, and optical
   properties as a function of Al concentration. The first method
   controlled the Al concentration by changing the relative number of Al to
   Zn deposition cycles; a process reported in the literature where water
   was used as the oxygen source. The second method involved coinjection of
   the DEZ and TMA during each cycle where the partial pressures of the
   precursors control the aluminum concentration. Depth profiles of the
   film composition using Auger electron spectroscopy confirmed a layered
   microstructure for the films prepared by the first method, whereas the
   second method led to a homogeneous distribution of the aluminum
   throughout the ZnO film. Beneath the surface layer the carbon
   concentrations for all of the films were below the detection limit.
   Comparison of their electrical and optical properties established that
   films deposited by coinjection of the precursors were superior. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This study investigates the use of road networks both within and outside
   of home jurisdictions (city (or town) and county of residence) by
   analyzing GPS data collected in the Minneapolis Saint Paul metropolitan
   area. The study tracked volunteers' travel behavior to determine which
   roads (and thus which class of roads) users chose to accommodate their
   travel needs. More than half of the travel on county roads and city
   streets occur outside of one's home city, but most travel is within
   one's home county. The average share of travel distance in the home
   county is more than 70\% for both county and city streets. The high
   share, which does not account for non-residents destined for the county
   to work or shop, e.g., implies that the free rider problem on city and
   county streets at the county level is minimal. Of particular concern is
   travel on city roads in cities other than one's own. To the extent that
   this is to go to a destination in that city, that travel is also local.
   However, because city and county roads are typically funded by those
   jurisdictions from land-based sources such as property taxes, through
   trips with neither end in the city through which they are traveling are
   in a very real sense ``free riders{''}, and pose a problem. With growing
   trip lengths and emerging economies of scale in road management, It may
   be appropriate to consider moving more roads from township, town, or
   city level to the county level of government. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00618.2011.-Single-beat imaging of myocardial
   activation promises to aid in both cardiovascular research and clinical
   medicine. In the present study we validate a three-dimensional (3D)
   cardiac electrical imaging (3DCEI) technique with the aid of
   simultaneous 3D intracardiac mapping to assess its capability to
   localize endocardial and epicardial initiation sites and image global
   activation sequences during pacing and ventricular tachycardia (VT) in
   the canine heart. Body surface potentials were measured simultaneously
   with bipolar electrical recordings in a closed-chest condition in
   healthy canines. Computed tomography images were obtained after the
   mapping study to construct realistic geometry models. Data analysis was
   performed on paced rhythms and VTs induced by norepinephrine (NE). The
   noninvasively reconstructed activation sequence was in good agreement
   with the simultaneous measurements from 3D cardiac mapping with a
   correlation coefficient of 0.74 +/- 0.06, a relative error of 0.29 +/-
   0.05, and a root mean square error of 9 +/- 3 ms averaged over 460 paced
   beats and 96 ectopic beats including premature ventricular complexes,
   couplets, and nonsustained monomorphic VTs and polymorphic VTs.
   Endocardial and epicardial origins of paced beats were successfully
   predicted in 72\% and 86\% of cases, respectively, during left
   ventricular pacing. The NE-induced ectopic beats initiated in the
   subendocardium by a focal mechanism. Sites of initial activation were
   estimated to be similar to 7 mm from the measured initiation sites for
   both the paced beats and ectopic beats. For the polymorphic VTs,
   beat-to-beat dynamic shifts of initiation site and activation pattern
   were characterized by the reconstruction. The present results suggest
   that 3DCEI can noninvasively image the 3D activation sequence and
   localize the origin of activation of paced beats and NE-induced VTs in
   the canine heart with good accuracy. This 3DCEI technique offers the
   potential to aid interventional therapeutic procedures for treating
   ventricular arrhythmias arising from epicardial or endocardial sites and
   to noninvasively assess the mechanisms of these arrhythmias.}},

Abstract = {{The phylum Chloroflexi contains several isolated bacteria that have been
   found to respire a diverse array of halogenated anthropogenic chemicals.
   The distribution and role of these Chloroflexi in uncontaminated
   terrestrial environments, where abundant natural organohalogens could
   function as potential electron acceptors, have not been studied. Soil
   samples (116 total, including 6 sectioned cores) from a range of
   uncontaminated sites were analyzed for the number of
   Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi 16S rRNA genes present.
   Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi populations were detected in all but 13
   samples. The concentrations of organochlorine ({[}organochlorine]),
   inorganic chloride, and total organic carbon (TOC) were obtained for 67
   soil core sections. The number of Dehalococcoides-like Chloroflexi 16S
   rRNA genes positively correlated with {[}organochlorine]/TOC while the
   number of Bacteria 16S rRNA genes did not. Dehalococcoides-like
   Chloroflexi were also observed to increase in number with a concomitant
   accumulation of chloride when cultured with an enzymatically produced
   mixture of organochlorines. This research provides evidence that
   organohalide-respiring Chloroflexi are widely distributed as part of
   uncontaminated terrestrial ecosystems, they are correlated with the
   fraction of TOC present as organochlorines, and they increase in
   abundance while dechlorinating organochlorines. These findings suggest
   that organohalide-respiring Chloroflexi may play an integral role in the
   biogeochemical chlorine cycle.}},

Abstract = {{As a persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic organic pollutant,
   perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) has been found ubiquitously in the
   environment, including in tap water. For the first time, we studied PFOS
   sorption from water to foods (nine commonly consumed vegetables, three
   meats, and cereals) at two temperatures to estimate the daily intake of
   PFOS attributable to cooking and food preparation. The values of the
   food water-distribution coefficient (K (F/W), l/kg) of PFOS ranged from
   7 to 19 l/kg for most vegetables and from 19 to 38 l/kg for meats.
   Celery exhibited the highest affinity toward PFOS (K (F/W) = 39.8 +/- A
   3.4 l/kg), whereas onions showed the lowest affinity toward PFOS (K
   (F/W) = 1.1 +/- A 0.4 l/kg). Adding table salt (sodium chloride) greatly
   increased PFOS sorption in most foods, except for celery and meats. The
   results indicate that human exposure to PFOS could result from the
   sorption of PFOS from water to food during food preparation, especially
   when using table salt. The average daily intake of PFOS through this
   route was estimated. Furthermore, raw and unprocessed foods (vegetables,
   meats, and cereals) bought from farmers' markets and grocery stores were
   basically free of PFOS and other long-chain perfluoroalkyl acids.}},

Volume = {{79}},

Abstract = {{Many wood-degrading fungi colonize specific types of forest trees, but
   often lack wood specificity in pure culture. This suggests that wood
   type affects competition among fungi and indirectly influences the soil
   residues generated. While assessing wood residues is an established
   science, linking this information to dominant fungal colonizers has
   proven to be difficult. In the studies presented here, we used
   isolate-specific quantitative PCR to quantify competitive success
   between two distinct fungi, Gloeophyllum trabeum and Irpex lacteus,
   brown and white rot fungi, respectively, colonizing three wood types
   (birch, pine, oak). Ergosterol (fungal biomass), fungal species-specific
   DNA copy numbers, mass loss, pH, carbon fractions, and alkali solubility
   were determined 3 and 8 weeks postinoculation from replicate wood
   sections. Quantitative PCR analyses indicated that I. lacteus
   consistently outcompeted G. trabeum, by several orders of magnitude, on
   all wood types. Consequently, wood residues exhibited distinct
   characteristics of white rot. Our results show that competitive
   interactions between fungal species can influence colonization success,
   and that this can have significant consequences on the outcomes of wood
   decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{A system for the realtime generation and control of multiple-focus
   ultrasound phased-array heating patterns is presented. The system
   employs a 1-MHz, 64-element array and driving electronics capable of
   fine spatial and temporal control of the heating pattern. The driver is
   integrated with a realtime 2-D temperature imaging system implemented on
   a commercial scanner. The coordinates of the temperature control points
   are defined on B-mode guidance images from the scanner, together with
   the temperature set points and controller parameters. The temperature at
   each point is controlled by an independent proportional, integral, and
   derivative controller that determines the focal intensity at that point.
   Optimal multiple-focus synthesis is applied to generate the desired
   heating pattern at the control points. The controller dynamically
   reallocates the power available among the foci from the shared power
   supply upon reaching the desired temperature at each control point.
   Furthermore, anti-windup compensation is implemented at each control
   point to improve the system dynamics. In vitro experiments in
   tissue-mimicking phantom demonstrate the robustness of the controllers
   for short (2-5 s) and longer multiple-focus high-intensity focused
   ultrasound exposures. Thermocouple measurements in the vicinity of the
   control points confirm the dynamics of the temperature variations
   obtained through noninvasive feedback.}},

   truncated beta-Bernoulli process is employed to infer an appropriate

   context of compressive sensing, significant improvements in image
   recovery are manifested using learned dictionaries, relative to using
   standard orthonormal image expansions. The compressive-measurement
   projections are also optimized for the learned dictionary. Additionally,
   we consider simpler (incomplete) measurements, defined by measuring a
   subset of image pixels, uniformly selected at random. Spatial
   interrelationships within imagery are exploited through use of the
   Dirichlet and probit stick-breaking processes. Several example results
   are presented, with comparisons to other methods in the literature.}},

Title = {{Sensor-Centric Data Reduction for Estimation With WSNs via Censoring and
   Quantization}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{400-414}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Consider a wireless sensor network (WSN) with a fusion center (FC)
   deployed to estimate signal parameters from noisy sensor measurements.
   If the WSN has a large number of low-cost, battery-operated sensor nodes
   with limited transmission bandwidth, then conservation of transmission
   resources (power and bandwidth) is paramount. To this end, the present
   paper develops a novel data reduction method which requires no
   inter-sensor collaboration and results in only a subset of the sensor
   measurements transmitted to the FC. Using interval censoring as a
   data-reduction method, each sensor decides separately whether to censor
   its acquired measurements based on a rule that promotes censoring of
   measurements with least impact on the estimator mean-square error (MSE).
   Leveraging the statistical distribution of sensor data, the censoring
   mechanism and the received uncensored data, FC-based estimators are
   derived for both deterministic (via maximum likelihood estimation) and
   random parameters (via maximum a posteriori probability estimation) for
   a linear-Gaussian model. Quantization of the uncensored measurements at
   the sensor nodes offers an additional degree of freedom in the resource
   conservation versus estimator MSE reduction tradeoff. Cramer-Rao bound
   analysis for the different censor-estimators and censor-quantizer
   estimators is also provided to benchmark and facilitate MSE-based
   performance comparisons. Numerical simulations corroborate the
   analytical findings and demonstrate that the proposed
   censoring-estimation approach performs competitively with alternative
   methods, under different sensing conditions, while having lower
   computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a robust downlink beamforming optimization problem for

   of transmit power is formulated subject to both quality-of-service (QoS)
   constraints on the secondary receivers and interference temperature
   constraints on the primary users, under the assumption of imperfect
   channel state information (CSI). The problem is a nonconvex
   quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and in general it is
   hard to achieve the global optimality. As a compromise, we present two
   randomized approximation algorithms for the problem via convex
   optimization techniques. Apart from the general setting of the robust
   beamforming problem, we identify one interesting special case, the
   robust problem of which can be solved efficiently. Simulation results
   are presented to demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed
   algorithms over an existing robust design.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon nanotube (CNT)/cement composites with different concentration
   levels of multi-walled CNT (MWNT) and water/cement ratios are
   fabricated. By comparing the responses of electrical resistance of these
   CNT/cement composites to compressive stress, the effects of MWNT
   concentration level and water/cement ratio on the piezoresistive
   sensitivity of composites are investigated. Experimental results
   indicate that the piezoresistive sensitivities of CNT/cement composites
   with 0.05, 0.1, and 1 wt\% of MWNT first increase and then decrease with
   the increase of CNT concentration levels. Water/cement ratio is another
   factor that affects the composite properties, the electrical resistance
   of CNT/cement composite with 0.6 water/cement ratio is more sensitive to
   compressive stress than that of composite with 0.45 water/cement ratio.
   The piezoresistive sensitivity is heavily dependent on the conductive
   network in the composites, which in turn is influenced by the CNT
   concentration level and water/cement ratio.}},

   enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Indium oxide and silica
   nanoparticles were layer-by-layer self-assembled with the oppositely
   charged polyelectrolyte as the electrochemical transducer and antibody
   immobilization site, respectively. The assay was conducted on a novel
   platform of indium oxide nanoparticle ISFETs, where the electric signals
   are generated in response to the concentration of target IgG using the
   labeled detecting antibody. The sandwiched ELISA structure catalyzed the
   conversion of the acidic substrate into neutral substance with the aid
   of horseradish peroxidase. The pH change in the substrate solution was
   detected by nanoparticle ISFETs. Normal rabbit IgG was used as a model
   antigen whose detection limit of 0.04 ng ml(-1) was found. The facile
   electric detection in the conventional assay through the semiconducting

Abstract = {{Rice bran wax (RBX) obtained during rice bran oil purification can form
   organogels in edible oils. The kinetics of crystallization and the
   viscous properties of RBX organogels were studied using differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), viscosity changes with varying temperature,
   hardness measurements by penetrometry, and synchrotron radiation X-ray
   diffraction (SR-XRD). The organogels were prepared by RBX in
   concentrations of 1\%, 3\%, 6\%, and 10\% on a weight basis in salad
   oil, olive oil, and camellia oil. The liquid oil type had no significant
   effect on the melting and crystallization temperatures of the RBX.
   However, the viscosity and the texture of the organogels differed with
   liquid oil type, temperature, and RBX concentration. Changes in the
   viscosity of the RBX organogels were monitored during cooling from 80
   degrees C to 20 degrees C. Drastic viscosity changes occurred in
   accordance with the onset of crystallization in DSC thermographs
   obtained at a rate of 5 degrees C/min. RBX in the olive oil and camellia
   oil mixtures had higher viscosity than RBX in the salad oil mixture,
   which correlates with the hardness obtained in texture measurements at
   20 degrees C. SR-XRD was used to clarify the crystal structures of the
   building blocks of the RBX organogels in salad oil. It was found that
   the RBX formed crystals with a long spacing of 7.3 +/- 1 nm and short
   spacings of 0.41 +/- 1 nm and 0.37 +/- 1 nm. The intensity of the
   long-spacing pattern was remarkably weaker than that of the
   short-spacing patterns, which demonstrated strong anisotropy in the
   crystal growth of RBX crystal particles.}},

Abstract = {{Recent work has demonstrated that enzymatic degradation of collagen
   fibers exhibits strain-dependent kinetics. Conceptualizing how the
   strain dependence affects remodeling of collagenous tissues is vital to
   our understanding of collagen management in native and bioengineered
   tissues. As a first step towards this goal, the current study puts
   forward a multiscale model for enzymatic degradation and remodeling of
   collagen networks for two sample geometries we routinely use in
   experiments as model tissues. The multiscale model, driven by
   microstructural data from an enzymatic decay experiment, includes an
   exponential strain-dependent kinetic relation for degradation and
   constant growth. For a dogbone sample under uniaxial load, the model
   predicted that the distribution of fiber diameters would spread over the
   course of degradation because of variation in individual fiber load. In
   a cross-shaped sample, the central region, which experiences smaller,
   more isotropic loads, showed more decay and less spread in fiber
   diameter compared to the arms. There was also a slight shift in average
   orientation in different regions of the cruciform. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{50-71}},

Abstract = {{Although various approaches have been proposed for modeling day-to-day
   traffic flow evolution, none of them, to the best of our knowledge, have
   been validated for disrupted networks due to the lack of empirical
   observations. By carefully studying the driving behavioral changes after
   the collapse of I-35W Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis,
   Minnesota, we found that most of the existing day-to-day traffic
   assignment models would not be suitable for modeling the traffic
   evolution under network disruption, because they assume that drivers'
   travel cost perception depends solely on their experiences from previous
   days. When a significant network change occurs unexpectedly, travelers'
   past experience on a traffic network may not be entirely useful because
   the unexpected network change could disturb the traffic greatly. To
   remedy this, in this paper, we propose a prediction-correction model to
   describe the traffic equilibration process. A ``predicted{''} flow
   pattern is constructed inside the model to accommodate the imperfect
   perception of congestion that is gradually corrected by actual travel
   experiences. We also prove rigorously that, under mild assumptions, the
   proposed prediction-correction process has the user equilibrium flow as
   a globally attractive point. The proposed model is calibrated and
   validated with the field data collected after the collapse of I-35W
   Bridge. This study bridges the gap between theoretical modeling and
   practical applications of day-to-day traffic equilibration approaches
   and furthers the understanding of traffic equilibration process after
   network disruption. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In a variety of applications of traffic flow, including traffic
   simulation, real-time estimation and prediction, one requires a
   probabilistic model of traffic flow. The usual approach to constructing
   such models involves the addition of random noise terms to deterministic
   equations, which could lead to negative traffic densities and mean
   dynamics that are inconsistent with the original deterministic dynamics.
   This paper offers a new stochastic model of traffic flow that addresses
   these issues. The source of randomness in the proposed model is the
   uncertainty inherent in driver gap choice, which is represented by
   random state dependent vehicle time headways. A wide range of time
   headway distributions is allowed. From the random time headways,
   counting processes are defined, which represent cumulative flows across
   cell boundaries in a discrete space and continuous time conservation
   framework. We show that our construction implicitly ensures
   non-negativity of traffic densities and that the fluid limit of the
   stochastic model is consistent with cell transmission model (CTM) based
   deterministic dynamics. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A unique method that applied a multilayer-immobilization strategy was
   developed to prepare nanofibrous enzymes for biosynthesis. LiCl
   co-electrospun with polyurethane nanofibers enabled strong physical
   adsorption of bovine serum albumin (BSA), forming the first layer of
   protein on the nanofibers; lipase AK was subsequently crosslinked to BSA
   as an outer layer of enzyme. The content of LiCl in nanofibers was found
   to be a sensitive factor affecting the activity and stability of the
   immobilized lipase. For bio-diesel synthesis from soybean oil and
   methanol in isooctane, the reaction rate catalyzed by nanofibrious
   lipase carrying 5 wt\% LiCl was 6.6-fold higher than fibers without
   LiCl, with a conversion of 91\% was achieved within 2 h. LiCl also
   induced much improved enzyme stability. The nanofibrous lipase with 5\%
   LiCl could be repeatedly used for 42 cycles without apparent activity
   loss, while the immobilized lipase without LiCl lost over 90\% activity

Abstract = {{We consider the design of distributed controller architectures for
   undirected networks of single-integrators. In the presence of stochastic
   disturbances, we identify communication topologies that balance the
   variance amplification of the network with the number of communication
   links. This is achieved by solving a parameterized family of
   sparsity-promoting optimal control problems whose solution traces the
   optimal tradeoff curve that starts at the centralized controller and
   ends at the controller with sparse communication links. We show that the
   optimal control problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program
   whose global solution can be computed efficiently. An example is
   provided to illustrate the utility of the developed approach.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic biology is facilitating novel methods and components to build
   in vivo and in vitro circuits to better understand and re-engineer
   biological networks. Circadian oscillators serve as molecular clocks
   that govern several important cellular processes such as cell division
   and apoptosis. Hence, successful demonstration of synthetic oscillators
   have become a primary design target for many synthetic biology
   endeavors. Recently, three synthetic transcriptional oscillators were
   demonstrated by Kim and Winfree utilizing modular architecture of
   synthetic gene analogues and a few enzymes. However, the periods and
   amplitudes of synthetic oscillators were sensitive to initial conditions
   and allowed limited tunability. In addition, it being a closed system,
   the oscillations were observe to die out after a certain period of time.
   To increase tunability and robustness of synthetic biochemical
   oscillators in the face of disturbances and modeling uncertainties, a
   control theoretic approach for real-time adjustment of oscillator
   behaviors would be required. In this paper, assuming an open system
   implementation is feasible, we demonstrate how dynamic inversion
   techniques can be used to synthesize the required controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Programmable logic devices have revolutionized the way in which digital
   circuits are built. FPGAs (Field Programmable Gate Arrays) and CPLDs
   (Complex Programmable Logic Devices) have become the standards for
   implementing digital systems. FPGAs and CPLDs offer much higher circuit
   density, improved reliability, and fewer system components when compared
   with traditional digital design using discrete small-scale or
   medium-scale integrated circuits, all of which make programmable logic
   devices very attractive to the digital designer. However, these devices
   hide important details involved in understanding digital fundamentals,
   and the resulting hardware is really more of a computer-generated black
   box than it is a carefully crafted, finetuned design. Creativity in the
   design is less visible when using FPGAs or CPLDs, and designers are not
   rewarded as satisfyingly for ``elegant{''} solutions to design problems.
   FPGAs and CPLDs implement solutions to digital design problems quickly
   and economically, both qualities that are important in an industrial
   setting. However, in an educational setting, the solution is not as
   important as understanding how the solution is reached, and these
   programmable devices automate and hide that process, making them less
   attractive as educational tools. Teaching digital design in a
   programmable logic device arena requires the instructor to inform
   students what is going on behind the scenes in the synthesis software.
   Otherwise, digital design degenerates into just another programming
   exercise, albeit using a hardware description language rather than
   traditional software languages.
   During Fall semester 2011, programmable logic devices were used for the
   first time 1 as the basis for lab exercises in a second semester,
   advanced digital design laboratory at UMD, replacing design using
   discrete digital integrated circuits. The experience exposed some
   limitations imposed by the technology. For example, when circuits must
   avoid logic hazards (momentary `` glitches{''} during transitions) as in
   asynchronous finite state machine design, FPGAs cannot be used properly,
   and CPLDs must be coerced into working by clumsily `` fooling{''} the
   synthesis software. These specific digital circuit designs cannot be
   mapped cleanly to programmable devices without some innovative
   techniques. This paper reveals some of the author's experiences in
   adapting his digital design laboratory to the programmable logic device
   arena.
   Programmable logic devices, though attractive to the experienced
   designer, can be awkward to use in certain educational settings. Digital
   design instructors must be aware of their limitations. Instructors must
   find creative ways around the limitations, and must restrain themselves
   from being brainwashed by the glitz of FPGAs and CPLDs. This paper
   identifies techniques for maintaining the excitement and rewards of
   creative digital design within the confined restrictions of a
   programmable logic device arena.}},

Abstract = {{A tooth is a heterogeneously structured object of translucent materials,
   such as enamel and dentin. The correct simulation of the appearance of
   teeth is useful in the field of dental restoration to detect the correct
   color and to develop materials for restoration. However, conventional
   surface reflection models do not capture the appearance of translucent
   materials accurately, because they assume that the rays of light are
   just reflected off the surface. For translucent objects, light not only
   bounces off the surface, but also interacts with the material under the
   surface. Therefore, physically correct rendering of teeth must take this
   into account to understand and model subsurface scattering. This paper
   discusses the optical characteristics of enamel and dentin. In addition,
   rendered images using volume photon mapping with Monte Carlo photon
   tracing are presented for enamel, dentin and biomaterials.}},

Title = {{Variable stoichiometry and homeostatic regulation of bacterial biomass
   elemental composition}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{Prokaryotic heterotrophs (hereafter, bacteria) represent a large
   proportion of global biomass, and therefore bacterial biomass
   stoichiometry likely exerts control on global phosphorus (P), carbon
   (C), and nitrogen cycling and primary productivity. In this study we
   grew recently isolated freshwater heterotrophic bacteria across an
   ecologically relevant range of resource C:P ratios (organic C to P ratio
   in available resources) to quantify the P requirements of these
   organisms and examine the degree to which they regulated their P content
   under P-sufficient and P-deficient conditions. Bacterial biomass was
   only limited by P when resource C:P was greater than 250 (by atoms).
   Bacterial C:P ranged from 71 to 174 under P sufficiency and from 252 to
   548 under P deficiency. Bacteria exhibited very little C:P homeostasis
   under P-sufficient growth conditions, greater C:P homeostasis under
   P-deficient conditions, and the ability of bacteria to outcompete one
   another in short-term experiments depended on a tradeoff between storing
   excess P for later use under P-deficient conditions or immediately using
   P to produce more biomass. These results indicate that freshwater
   heterotrophic bacteria are not as P-rich as previously thought and that
   homeostatic regulation of C:P stoichiometry depends on the individual
   taxa and what resource (organic C or available P) is limiting bacterial
   growth. Individual bacterial populations can vary between strong C:P
   homeostasis under P deficiency to virtually no C:P homeostasis under P
   sufficiency, but variation between taxa and the effect this has on
   competitive ability may dampen the signal in C:P-B at the bacterial
   community level. Nevertheless, the prevalence of homeostatic and
   non-homeostatic strategies in a bacterial community should have
   important implications for nutrient regeneration and carbon cycling.}},

Abstract = {{The Chuquicamata Underground Mine project in the Atacama Desert in
   northern Chile is one of the largest planned mining projects in the
   world to use the method of block caving with macro-blocks option to mine
   copper ore.
   VP-CODELCO (Vice-President Projects Office of the National Copper
   Corporation of Chile) is currently developing a feasibility engineering
   evaluation of excavated infrastructure for the project. The evaluation
   considers, among others, the construction of two ventilation shafts of
   internal diameter 11 meters and approximate depth of 970 meters. A
   geo-mechanical study has been carried out to evaluate the stability of
   one of these shafts and to provide recommendations about support
   requirement. As part of this study, empirical methods,
   confinement-convergence analytical models, and two-dimensional and
   three-dimensional continuum models have been developed and applied to
   evaluate the influence of the stresses and existing geological features,
   such as the presence of two major shear zones and different lithological
   units, on the mechanical response of the excavation. This paper
   introduces general aspects of the Chuquicamata Underground Mine project
   and discusses in particular geo-mechanical analyses carried out to
   evaluate stability and support requirement for the large diameter

Title = {{Spontaneously Formed FePt Graded Granular Media With a Large Gain Factor}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{In conventional magnetic recording media fabrication processes,
   magnetically soft regions of composite or graded material are prepared
   by varying either the substrate temperature or the film composition
   during deposition. In this work, ultrathin FePt granular media with
   graded composition was fabricated directly by spontaneous layer
   diffusion between FePt and Pt layers during the film deposition.
   Electron energy loss spectroscopy analysis on individual FePt columnar
   grains identified the composition distribution of Fe and confirmed the
   Fe composition gradient. A large ``gain factor{''} of 3.74, indicative
   of a relatively high-thermal energy barrier, was obtained in this
   spontaneously formed FePt graded granular media.}},

Title = {{Novel System Design for Readback at 10 Terabits per Square Inch User
   Areal Density}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{A novel system design for sensing very high density magnetic recording
   data, such as that envisioned for two-dimensional magnetic recording, is
   proposed. The key idea is a rotated sense head, so that the shields are
   aligned down-track, combined with oversampled signal processing to
   regain the lost down-track resolution. Based on a random Voronoi grain
   model, simulation indicates that for bits with dimension of 8 nm x 6 nm,
   5.5 nm grains, and a reader with 4 nm x 18 nm x 18 nm free layer and 11
   nm shield-shield spacing, the bit error rate can drop from 20.9\% for a
   normally positioned head array to 4.2\% for a single-rotated single head
   with sampling period of 2 nm, a minimum mean squared error equalizer,
   and pattern-dependent noise prediction detector. The user density
   computed using the Shannon capacity limit is greatly increased to 10.1
   Tb/in(2).}},

Title = {{Spin-Transfer Torque Switching Above Ambient Temperature}},
Journal = {{IEEE MAGNETICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Abstract = {{We report the temperature dependences of tunneling magnetoresistance
   ratio, coercivity, thermal stability, and switching current distribution
   of magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) in the temperature range 25-80
   degrees C, the most probable working environment for spin-transfer
   torque random access memory (STT-RAM). Two distinct temperature
   dependence of the switching current density are apparent due to two
   switching mechanisms: a switching current density decrease with
   increasing temperature in the long-pulse (>1 mu s) regime, a result of
   thermally activated switching, but no decrease in the short-pulse (<10
   ns) regime, as a result of precessional switching. In the temperature
   range studied, the switching current density variation is less sensitive
   to environmental temperature than it is to switching time. Thus,
   switching time is the more important factor to consider in STT-RAM
   design.}},
