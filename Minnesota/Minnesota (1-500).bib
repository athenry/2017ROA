Abstract = {{Zeolites with hierarchical structures are of particular interest because
   such structures can improve molecular diffusion, particularly that of
   bulky molecules. N,N,N,N',N',N'-Hexapropylpentanediammonium cations
   (Pr-6-diquat-5), a simple diquaternary ammonium organic structure
   directing agent (OSDA), can direct the formation of hierarchically and
   sequentially intergrown MFI zeolites without employing any mesoporogens.
   In this paper, the effects of OSDAs having structures similar to
   Pr-6-diquat-5 but different lengths of alkyl spacers and/or different
   substituting groups on the phase selectivity and morphology of the
   resulting zeolites are presented. It was revealed that the number of
   carbon atoms between two charged nitrogens in the OSDAs significantly
   affected the intergrowth and morphology of the crystals formed. In
   addition, the propyl-substituted OSDAs were found to be very selective
   to the formation of MFI zeolite, whereas the butyl-substituted OSDAs
   were not. For Pr-6-diquat-5, the condition for the formation of
   hierarchically and sequentially intergrown MFI zeolites was somewhat
   narrow with the optimized molar composition of 1 SiO2:0.2
   Pr-6-diquat-5:0.375-0.500 KOH:200 H2O:4 EtOH. Defect lines observed on
   the obtained zeolite crystals by a transmission electron microscope were
   considered to be connectors for such intergrowths. The unique
   intergrowth formed by Pr-6-diquat-5 was surmised to be due to the
   unusual fitting of Pr-6-diquat-5 inside the channels of MFI zeolite,
   which was explained by comparing molecular dimensions and stabilization
   energies of each OSDA.}},

Abstract = {{Binary composites formed by individually mixing exfoliated graphene
   oxide modified with amine terminated poly(butadiene acrylonitrile) (GA)
   and a spherical micelle forming poly(ethylene
   oxide)-b-poly(ethylene-alt-propylene) (OP) diblock copolymer with a
   thermoset epoxy, and the associated GA/OP/epoxy ternary composites, were
   prepared and studied as a function of the molecular weight between
   cross-links. The rigid GA filler dispersed well in the cured epoxies as
   established by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The toughening
   efficacy of GA alone was found to depend strongly on the modifier
   concentration and the matrix cross-link density with an optimal 1.7-fold
   increase in the critical strain energy release rate (G(Ic)) over the
   neat epoxy obtained With a 0.04 wt \% loading, in the most lightly
   cross-linked (M-c = 6100 g/mol) material. Addition of 5 wt \% OP to this
   epoxy resin enhanced G(Ic) by a factor of 12, Combining the hard GA and
   soft OP modifiers at the same loading levels (0.04 and 5 wt \%,
   respectively) resulted in 18 times the G(Ic) of the unmodified material,
   a 31\% improvement over the effect anticipated by simple addition of the
   fracture properties of the binary composites. Decreasing M-c to 700
   g/mol eliminated this synergistic effect while reducing the overall
   improvement in G(Ic) to just 3 times that of the neat epoxy. Topological
   features on the fracture surfaces, imaged using a scanning electron
   microscope (SEM), suggest that the Synergistic toughening of the
   GA/OP/epoxy ternary composite involves concurrent mechanisms operating
   on different length scales, including micelle cavitation and graphene
   debonding, resulting in simultaneous shear yielding, crack pinning, and
   crack deflection.}},

Abstract = {{Chain exchange kinetics of diblock copolymer micelles with lower
   critical micellization temperature (LCMT) phase behavior were
   investigated using time-resolved small angle neutron scattering
   (TR-SANS). Three nearly identical isotopically substituted pairs of
   poly(methyl methacrylate)block-poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PMMA-b-PnBMA)
   diblocks were used in mixtures of the room temperature ionic liquids
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide and
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide. In this
   case, the h-PnBMA and d(9)-PnBMA blocks form the micellar cores. The
   results are consistent with previous measurements in other systems, in
   that the barrier to chain extraction scales linearly with the core block
   length. By varying the ratio of the two homologous solvents in the
   mixture, the value of chi between the core block and the solvent is
   varied systematically. The results show that the solvent selectivity has
   a remarkable effect on the chain exchange rate, as anticipated by a
   previous theory. However, in contrast to an assumption in previous
   studies, we find that the barrier to chain exchange is not simply
   proportional to chi. Accordingly, we propose a more elaborate function
   of chi for the energy barrier, which is rationalized by a calculation in
   the spirit of Flory-Huggins theory. This modification can account for
   the chain exchange behavior when chi is relatively modest, i.e., in the
   vicinity of the critical micelle temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric and triboelectric nanogenerators have been developed as
   rising energy-harvesting devices in the past few years to effectively
   convert mechanical energy into electricity. Here, a novel hybrid
   piezo/triboelectric nano generator based on BaTiO3 NP/PDMS composite
   film was developed in a simple and low-cost way. The effects of the BTO
   content and polarization degree on the output performance were
   systematically studied. The device with 20 wt \% BTO in PDMS and a
   100-ym-thick film showed the highest output power. We also designed
   three measurement modes to record hybrid, triboelectric, and
   piezoelectric outputs separately with a simple structure that has only
   two electrodes. The hybrid output performance is higher than the tribo-
   and piezoelectric performances. This work will provide not only a new
   way to enhance the output power of nanogenerators, but also new
   opportunities for developing built-in power sources in self-powered
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion MRI (dMRI) reveals microstructural features of the brain white
   matter by quantifying the anisotropic diffusion of water molecules
   within axonal bundles. Yet, identifying features such as axonal
   orientation dispersion, density, diameter, etc., in complex white matter
   fiber configurations (e.g. crossings) has proved challenging. Besides
   optimized data acquisition and advanced biophysical models,
   computational procedures to fit such models to the data are critical.
   However, these procedures have been largely overlooked by the dMRI
   microstructure community and new, more versatile, approaches are needed
   to solve complex biophysical model fitting problems. Existing methods
   are limited to models assuming single fiber orientation, relevant to
   limited brain areas like the corpus callosum, or multiple orientations
   but without the ability to extract detailed microstructural features.
   Here, we introduce a new and versatile optimization technique (MIX),
   which enables microstructure imaging of crossing white matter fibers. We
   provide a MATLAB implementation of MIX, and demonstrate its
   applicability to general microstructure models in fiber crossings using
   synthetic as well as ex-vivo and in-vivo brain data.}},

Abstract = {{High rates of local recurrence in tobacco-related head and neck squamous
   cell carcinoma (HNSCC) are commonly attributed to unresected fields of
   precancerous tissue. Because they are not easily detectable at the time
   of surgery without additional biopsies, there is a need for noninvasive
   methods to predict the extent and dynamics of these fields. Here, we
   developed a spatial stochastic model of tobacco-related HNSCC at the
   tissue level and calibrated the model using a Bayesian framework and
   population-level incidence data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and
   End Results (SEER) registry. Probabilistic model analyses were performed
   to predict the field geometry at time of diagnosis, and model
   predictions of age-specific recurrence risks were tested against outcome
   data from SEER. The calibrated models predicted a strong dependence of
   the local field size on age at diagnosis, with a doubling of the
   expected field diameter between ages at diagnosis of 50 and 90 years,
   respectively. Similarly, the probability of harboring multiple, clonally
   unrelated fields at the time of diagnosis was found to increase
   substantially with patient age. On the basis of these findings, we
   hypothesized a higher recurrence risk in older than in younger patients
   when treated by surgery alone; we successfully tested this hypothesis
   using age-stratified outcome data. Further clinical studies are needed
   to validate the model predictions in a patient-specific setting. This
   work highlights the importance of spatial structure in models of
   epithelial carcinogenesis and suggests that patient age at diagnosis may
   be a critical predictor of the size and multiplicity of precancerous
   lesions. (C)2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Attribute grammars are a suitable formalism to express complex software
   language analysis and manipulation algorithms, which rely on multiple
   traversals of the underlying syntax tree. Attribute grammars have been
   extended with mechanisms such as reference, higher order and circular
   attributes. Such extensions provide a powerful modular mechanism and
   allow the specification of complex computations. This paper studies an
   elegant and simple, zipper-based embedding of attribute grammars and
   their extensions as first class citizens. In this setting, language
   specifications are defined as a set of independent, off-the-shelf
   components that can easily be composed into a powerful, executable
   language processor. Techniques to describe automatic bidirectional
   transformations between grammars in this setting are also described.
   Several real examples of language specification and processing programs
   have been implemented. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A mathematical model for zeolite membrane module performance and its use
   for techno-economic evaluation of improved energy efficiency hybrid
   membrane-distillation processes for butane isomer separations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{520}},
Pages = {{434-449}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The aim of this work is to develop enabling tools that can assess the
   potential of zeolite membranes for industrial applications. The specific
   objectives are: (1) Develop a detailed mathematical model of a zeolite
   membrane separation process for accurate performance prediction under
   industrial conditions, and (2) Perform conceptual process design and
   techno-economic evaluation of the overall process for an application
   specific flowsheet. To this end, a detailed mathematical model, based on
   the real adsorption solution (RAS) theory and the Maxwell-Stefan
   formulation for transport was developed to describe permeation through a
   zeolite membrane. Effects like support resistances to transport, use of
   sweep gas and concentration polarization were included. The model is
   further applied to study butane isomer separation using a MFI-type
   zeolite membrane. A comparison of steady state flux and separation
   factor predicted by the model with the experimentally determined values
   suggests that the permeation in the real membranes is lower than that
   for the zeolite crystals. This lower permeance is attributed to the
   microstructural defects and suggests that there is a considerable scope
   of improvement in the performance of current state-of-the-art real MFI
   membranes. It is shown that up to a 10-fold increase in permeance
   through the membrane is practical, beyond which the external resistance
   starts to dominate. Furthermore, the detailed zeolite membrane model is
   integrated into a process level simulation, to evaluate the membrane
   performance in industrial settings, and a techno-economic analysis is
   also performed to this end. While single stage membrane process does not
   achieve the target purity and multi-stage membrane process requires
   prohibitively large area, a hybrid membrane/distillation process is
   found to be energy efficient and economically attractive. (C) 2016

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Osteosarcoma is the most common primary bone tumor, with metastatic
   disease responsible for most treatment failure and patient death. A
   forward genetic screen utilizing Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis in mice
   previously identified potential genetic drivers of osteosarcoma
   metastasis, including Slit-Robo GTPase-Activating Protein 2 (Srgap2).
   This study evaluates the potential role of SRGAP2 in
   metastases-associated properties of osteosarcoma cell lines through
   Srgap2 knockout via the CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system and conditional
   overexpression in the murine osteosarcoma cell lines K12 and K7M2.
   Proliferation, migration, and anchorage independent growth were
   evaluated. RNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry of human osteosarcoma
   tissue samples were used to further evaluate the potential role of the
   Slit-Robo pathway in osteosarcoma. The effects of Srgap2 expression
   modulation in the murine OS cell lines support the hypothesis that
   SRGAP2 may have a role as a suppressor of metastases in osteosarcoma.
   Additionally, SRGAP2 and other genes in the Slit-Robo pathway have
   altered transcript levels in a subset of mouse and human osteosarcoma,
   and SRGAP2 protein expression is reduced or absent in a subset of
   primary tumor samples. SRGAP2 and other axon guidance proteins likely
   play a role in osteosarcoma metastasis, with loss of SRGAP2 potentially
   contributing to a more aggressive phenotype.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interface (BCI) technologies aim to provide a bridge
   between the human brain and external devices. Prior research using
   non-invasive BCI to control virtual objects, such as computer cursors
   and virtual helicopters, and real-world objects, such as wheelchairs and
   quadcopters, has demonstrated the promise of BCI technologies. However,
   controlling a robotic arm to complete reach-and-grasp tasks efficiently
   using non-invasive BCI has yet to be shown. In this study, we found that
   a group of 13 human subjects could willingly modulate brain activity to
   control a robotic arm with high accuracy for performing tasks requiring
   multiple degrees of freedom by combination of two sequential low
   dimensional controls. Subjects were able to effectively control reaching
   of the robotic arm through modulation of their brain rhythms within the
   span of only a few training sessions and maintained the ability to
   control the robotic arm over multiple months. Our results demonstrate
   the viability of human operation of prosthetic limbs using non-invasive

Abstract = {{Low molar mass (3-17 kg/mol) amino-telechelic polyethylene (ATPE) was
   used to reactively compatibilize poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and
   high-density polyethylene (HDPE) via ester aminolysis of PET. A
   tertbutyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-protected polyethylene precursor was
   thermolytically deprotected during the melt-blending process to render
   the reactive amine termini. Spectroscopic analysis of a model reaction
   confirmed the presence of amide functionality in the resultant material.
   Through blending studies, we found that low loadings of ATPE (0.5 wt \%)
   significantly reduced the volume of the dispersed HDPE phase particles
   by a factor of 8 when compared to a binary PET/HDPE blend as assessed by
   scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Mechanical analysis of the
   ATPE-compatibilized blends showed a 12 fold increase in the elongation
   at break over the unmodified PET/HDPE blend. Ultimately, the results
   here offer a new approach to reactively compatibilize and toughen
   PET/HDPE blends and open the door for other uses of amino-telechelic
   polyethylene.}},

Abstract = {{Graft block polymers are defined by several architectural parameters,
   including backbone flexibility, graft density, backbone length,
   side-chain composition, and side chain length. In this work we probe the
   impacts of each of these parameters on the phase behavior, Theological
   properties, and mechanical performance of these materials. Specifically,
   we examine two sets of materials prepared from backbones of different
   inherent flexibility. One set was prepared from poly{[}(n-butyl
   acrylate)-co-(2-hydroxyethyl acrylate)] (BxEy) copolymers; the other was
   prepared from hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) samples. Sequential
   ring-opening transesterification polymerization from these
   hydroxyl-functionalized macroinitiatiors yielded a diblock graft
   architecture containing a rubbery interior block and semicrystalline
   exterior blocks tethered to a flexible (B-x,E-y) or rigid (HPMC)
   backbone. Good control over side-chain molar mass and composition and
   judicious choice of the graft block segments enabled the preparation of
   materials that were either ordered or disordered in the melt state. In
   the former case, crystallization destroys existing order in the
   material; in the latter case crystallization induces new microphase
   separation in the bulk. Many of the structure mechanical property
   relationships observed for graft block copolymers with rigid backbones
   are maintained for graft block polymers with semiflexible backbones,
   including the tendency for samples to remain transparent when stretched.
   However, interestingly, the effects of graft density and backbone length
   are quite different depending on the rigidity of the backbone.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) heterostructure
   Fe/Ag/Fe/InAs/Ag(100) in the currentperpendicular- to-plane geometry is
   presented. Calculations are based on a realistic tight-banding model
   with full spd bands and the recursive Green's function algorithm.
   Results show that the system's GMR can reach values above 1000\%. This
   GMR enhancement mainly is a result of the wave-vector filtering effect
   imposed by the InAs layer, restricting conductance within a small region
   around the Gamma point in the 2D Brillouin zone. Calculations also
   reveal that when the Fermi level sits in the InAs band gap, MR gradually
   saturates as a function of InAs thickness with a smooth plateau; whereas
   when the Fermi level is in the InAs conduction band and close to the
   band bottom, GMR exhibits an oscillatory behavior with a large period.
   GMR oscillations are also observed with respect to Ag thickness, with
   oscillation amplitude determined by the Fermi level position relative to
   the InAs conduction band edge. The oscillation periods in both cases can
   be well explained by the concept of quantum-well states, and are
   determined by the spanning vector of the Fermi surface belly of the
   material whose thickness is varied. The observed GMR oscillations are
   due to the quantum interference of conduction electrons near the Gamma
   point. The GMR and area-resistance (RA) product profiles at a wide range
   of Fermi energy positions relative to InAs bands are also compared. Near
   the GMR peak (with GMR above 1000\%) in the conduction band, RA product
   can be as low as 8.8 Omega mu m(2). This feature of large GMR but small
   RA product results from the wave-vector filtering effect of doped InAs,
   and it makes the structure under study distinct from conventional GMR
   systems (small GMR, small RA) or magnetic tunnel junctions (large GMR,
   large RA).}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a modeling of expected link delay (i.e., data
   delivery delay) on a two-way road segment for carry-and-forward data
   delivery schemes in vehicular networks. Recently, a lot of vehicles can
   communicate with each other by dedicated short-range communications
   (DSRC) for vehicular networking. In the near future, more vehicles will
   be equipped with DSRC devices because of governmental policies for
   driving safety. In this paper, we derive a link delay model on a two-way
   road segment. This link delay model is essential to support multihop
   infrastructure-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-vehicle data delivery in
   vehicular networks as disruption tolerant networks. Through simulation,
   it is shown that our two-way link delay model is more accurate than the
   legacy two-way link delay model. Furthermore, by applying our model to
   data unicasting, we show that our model is precise enough to support the
   efficient data unicasting on vehicular networks. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{While fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) presents an attractive
   therapeutic strategy, it remains unclear how to choose the microbiota
   repertoire that most effectively transfers benefit to recipients. We
   identified a beneficial taxonomic repertoire in a transgenic mouse model
   (RIP140m phi KD) which resists the development of high fat diet
   (HFD)-induced metabolic diseases due to enhanced anti-inflammation
   engineered by lowering receptor interacting protein (RIP140) expression
   in macrophage. We confirmed using FMT from HFD-fed RIP140m phi KD to
   wild type (WT) mice that recipient mice acquired the microbiota
   repertoire of donor mice. Importantly, FMT from RIP140m phi KD to WT not
   only effectively transferred the beneficial taxonomic repertoire to WT
   recipients, but also enabled recipient animals acquiring the
   anti-inflammatory status of RIP140m phi KD donor animals and avoid
   HFD-induced insulin resistance, which is associated with significantly
   improved intestinal integrity. We conclude that FMT can transfer not
   only microbiota but also the donors' intestinal innate immune status and
   improved intestinal integrity.}},

Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{11774-11782}},

Abstract = {{There is an increasing need for highly sensitive and quantitative
   diagnostics at the point-of-care. The lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) is
   one of the most widely used point-of-care diagnostic tests; however,
   LFAs generally suffer from low sensitivity and lack of quantification.
   To overcome these limitations, thermal contrast amplification (TCA) is a
   new method that is based on the laser excitation of gold nanoparticles
   (GNPs), the most commonly used visual signature, to evoke a thermal
   signature. To facilitate the clinical translation of the TCA technology,
   we present the development of a TCA reader, a platform technology that
   significantly improves the limit of detection and provides
   quantification of disease antigens in LFAs. This TCA reader provides
   enhanced sensitivity over visual detection by the human eye or by a
   colorimetric reader (e.g., BD Veritor System Reader). More specifically,
   the TCA reader demonstrated up to an 8-fold enhanced analytical
   sensitivity and quantification among LFAs for influenza, malaria, and
   Clostridium difficile. Systematic characterization of the laser,
   infrared camera, and other components of the reader and their
   integration into a working reader instrument are described. The
   development of the TCA reader enables simple, highly sensitive
   quantification of LFAs at the point-of-care.}},

Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{The formulation of a kinetic model for a complex reaction network
   typically yields reaction rates which vary over orders of magnitude.
   This results in time scale separation that makes the model inherently
   stiff. In this work, a graph-theoretic framework is developed for time
   scale decomposition of complex reaction networks to separate the slow
   and fast time scales, and to identify pseudo-species that evolve only in
   the slow time scale. The reaction network is represented using a
   directed bi-partite graph and cycles that correspond to closed walks are
   used to identify interactions between species participating in
   fast/equilibrated reactions. Subsequently, an algorithm which connects
   the cycles to form the pseudo species is utilized to eliminate the fast
   rate terms. These pseudo-species are used to formulate reduced,
   non-stiff kinetic models of the reaction system. Two reaction systems
   are considered to show the efficacy of this framework in the context of
   thermochemical and biochemical processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Death receptor 5 (DR5) is an apoptosis-inducing member of the tumor
   necrosis factor receptor superfamily, whose activity has been linked to
   membrane cholesterol content. Upon ligand binding, DR5 forms large
   clusters within the plasma membrane that have often been assumed to be
   manifestations of receptor co-localization in cholesterol-rich membrane
   domains. However, we have recently shown that DR5 clusters are more than
   just randomly aggregated receptors. Instead, these are highly structured
   networks held together by receptor dimers. These dimers are stabilized
   by specific transmembrane helix-helix interactions, including a
   disulfide bond in the long isoform of the receptor. The complex
   relationships among DR5 network formation, transmembrane helix
   dimerization, membrane cholesterol, and receptor activity has not been
   established. It is unknown whether the membrane itself plays an active
   role in driving DR5 transmembrane helix interactions or in the formation
   of the networks. We show that cholesterol depletion in cells does not
   inhibit the formation of DR5 networks. However, the networks that form
   in cholesterol-depleted cells fail to induce caspase cleavage. These
   results suggest a potential structural difference between active and
   inactive networks. As evidence, we show that cholesterol is necessary
   for the covalent dimerization of DR5 transmembrane domains. Molecular
   simulations and experiments in synthetic vesicles on the DR5
   transmembrane dimer suggest that dimerization is facilitated by
   increased helicity in a thicker bilayer. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial peptides are a promising alternative to traditional
   antibiotics, but their utility is limited by high production costs and
   poor bioavailability profiles. Bacterial production and delivery of
   antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) directly at the site of infection may
   offer a path for effective therapeutic application. In this study, we
   have developed a vector that can be used for the production and
   secretion of seven antimicrobial peptides from both Escherichia coli
   MC1061 F' and probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. The vector pMPES (Modular
   Peptide Expression System) employs the Microcin V (MccV) secretion
   system and a powerful synthetic promoter to drive AMP production.
   Herein, we demonstrate the capacity of pMPES to produce inhibitory
   levels of MccV, Microcin L (MccL), Microcin N (McnN), Enterocin A
   (EntA), Enterocin P (EntP), Hiracin JM79 (HirJM79) and Enterocin B
   (EntB). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such a
   broadly-applicable secretion system for AMP production. This type of
   modular expression system could expedite the development of sorely

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial peptides are a promising alternative to traditional
   antibiotics, but their utility is limited by high production costs and
   poor bioavailability profiles. Bacterial production and delivery of
   antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) directly at the site of infection may
   offer a path for effective therapeutic application. In this study, we
   have developed a vector that can be used for the production and
   secretion of seven antimicrobial peptides from both Escherichia coli
   MC1061 F' and probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917. The vector pMPES (Modular
   Peptide Expression System) employs the Microcin V (MccV) secretion
   system and a powerful synthetic promoter to drive AMP production.
   Herein, we demonstrate the capacity of pMPES to produce inhibitory
   levels of MccV, Microcin L (MccL), Microcin N (McnN), Enterocin A
   (EntA), Enterocin P (EntP), Hiracin JM79 (HirJM79) and Enterocin B
   (EntB). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of such a
   broadly-applicable secretion system for AMP production. This type of
   modular expression system could expedite the development of sorely
   needed antimicrobial technologies.}},

Title = {{Quality control of subgrade soil using intelligent compaction}},
Journal = {{INNOVATIVE INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Intelligent Compaction (IC) of subgrade soil has been proposed to
   continuously monitor the stiffness of subgrade during its compaction.
   Modern IC rollers are vibratory compactors equipped with (1) an onboard
   measuring system capable of estimating the stiffness of the pavement
   material being compacted, (2) Global Positioning System (GPS) sensor to
   precisely locate the roller, and (3) an integrated mapping and reporting
   system. Using IC, the roller operator is able to evaluate the entire
   subgrade and address deficiencies encountered during compaction.
   Continuous monitoring of quality during construction can help build
   better quality and long-lasting pavements. However, most of the
   commercially available IC rollers report stiffness in terms of Original
   Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) specified indicator, known as Intelligent
   Compaction Measurement Value (ICMV). Although useful, additional tests
   are required to establish the correlation between these ICMV values and
   the resilient modulus of subgrade (M-r). Since the mechanistic design of
   the pavement is performed using M-r, it is important to know if the
   design M-r is achieved on the entire subgrade during compaction. This
   paper presents a systematic procedure for monitoring the level of
   compaction of subgrade in real time using intelligent compaction (IC).
   Specifically, the Intelligent Compaction Analyzer (ICA) developed at the
   University of Oklahoma was used for estimating the modulus of the
   subgrade. Results from two demonstration studies show that the ICA is
   able to estimate subgrade modulus with an accuracy that is acceptable
   for quality control activities during the construction of pavements.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we review the literature published on vacuum drying of
   wood. Vacuum drying is not a new technology, and its use for drying wood
   has been suggested since the early 1900s. Technologies for vacuum drying
   of wood can be classified by the heating method used. In this paper, we
   define vacuum- drying methods in four groups: conductive heating vacuum,
   cyclic vacuum, superheated steam vacuum, and dielectric vacuum.
   Advantages of drying wood below atmospheric pressure are the ability to
   dry at lower temperatures (and thus lower the probability of developing
   some drying defects), greatly reduced drying times, color preservation,
   greater energy efficiency, better control of volatile organic compound
   emissions, and the ability to dry very large cross sections. Some
   characteristics that differentiate vacuum from conventional drying are
   that in vacuum the primary driving force is the total pressure
   difference, the prevailing moisture transfer mechanism is water vapor
   bulk flow, and there is greater water migration in the longitudinal
   direction. While past research has focused on increasing}},

Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) are used to correct motor impairments of the
   ankle. While current AFOs are passive, advances in technology and
   wearable robotics have opened the opportunity for a powered AFO. The
   hydraulic ankle foot orthosis (HAFO) is a device that takes advantage of
   the exceptional power-to-weight and force-to-weight of hydraulic fluid
   power. The device is untethered, and the power transmission chain is
   battery-electric motor-hydraulic pump-hose-cylinder, with the power
   supply worn at the waist and the cylinder actuators at the ankle. The
   fluid power circuit is configured as an electrohydraulic actuator (EHA)
   that is controlled by controlling the electric motor. The first
   prototype weighs 3.3 kg of which 0.97 kg is worn at the ankle.
   Steady-state torque-velocity performance showed that the prototype can
   provide 65 N.m of assistance torque and a no-load velocity of 105 deg/s.
   Closed-loop position control showed low steady-state error but a slow
   response. The current prototype demonstrates the potential of hydraulics
   for providing large torques in a compact, lightweight device. The speed
   performance of the prototype is inadequate for normal walking but can be
   improved by switching to servo valve control or by developing a custom
   hydraulic pump.}},

Abstract = {{Wicked problems like sustainable energy and financial market stability

   information systems (IS) individuals, organizations, and markets and
   that deliver solutions in addition to insights. We describe an approach
   to address these challenges through competitive benchmarking (CB), a
   novel research method that helps interdisciplinary research communities
   tackle complex challenges of societal scale by using different types of
   data from a variety of sources such as usage data from customers,
   production patterns from producers, public policy and regulatory
   constraints, etc. for a given instantiation. Further, the CB platform
   generates data that can be used to improve operational strategies and
   judge the effectiveness of regulatory regimes and policies. We describe
   our experience applying CB to the sustainable energy challenge in the

Abstract = {{Polynomial chaos expansion and Gaussian mixture models are combined in a
   hybrid fashion to propagate state uncertainty for spacecraft with
   initial Gaussian errors. Polynomial chaos expansion models uncertainty
   by performing an expansion using orthogonal polynomials. The accuracy of
   polynomial chaos expansion for a given problem can be improved by
   increasing the order of the orthogonal polynomial expansion. The number
   of terms in the orthogonal polynomial expansion increases factorially
   with dimensionality of the problem, thereby reducing the effectiveness
   of the polynomial chaos expansion approach for problems of moderately
   high dimensionality. This paper shows a combination of Gaussian mixture
   model and polynomial chaos expansion, Gaussian mixture model-polynomial
   chaos expansion as an alternative form of the multi-element polynomial
   chaos expansion. Gaussian mixture model-polynomial chaos expansion
   reduces the overall order required to reach a desired accuracy. The
   initial distribution is converted to a Gaussian mixture model, and
   polynomial chaos expansion is used to propagate the state uncertainty
   represented by each of the elements through the nonlinear dynamics.
   Splitting the initial distribution into a Gaussian mixture model reduces
   the size of the covariance associated with each new element, thereby
   reducing the domain of approximation and allowing for lower-order
   polynomials to be used. Several spacecraft uncertainty propagation
   examples are shown using Gaussian mixture model-polynomial chaos
   expansion. The resulting distributions are shown to efficiently capture
   the full shape of the true non-Gaussian distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Reliable transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) measures for
   probing corticomotor excitability are important when assessing the
   physiological effects of noninvasive brain stimulation. The primary
   objective of this study was to examine test-retest reliability of an
   interhemispheric inhibition (IHI) index measurement in stroke.
   Materials and Methods: Ten subjects with chronic stroke (>= 6 months)
   completed two IHI testing sessions per week for three weeks (six testing
   sessions total). A single investigator measured IHI in the
   contra-to-ipsilesional primary motor cortex direction and in the
   opposite direction using bilateral paired-pulse TMS. Weekly sessions
   were separated by 24 hours with a 1-week washout period separating
   testing weeks. To determine if motor-evoked potential (MEP)
   quantification method affected measurement reliability, IHI indices
   computed from both MEP amplitude and area responses were found.
   Reliability was assessed with two-way, mixed intraclass correlation
   coefficients (ICC(3,k)). Standard error of measurement and minimal
   detectable difference statistics were also determined.
   Results: With the exception of the initial testing week, IHI indices
   measured in the contra-to-ipsilesional hemisphere direction demonstrated
   moderate to excellent reliability (ICC = 0.725-0.913).
   Ipsi-to-contralesional IHI indices depicted poor or invalid reliability
   estimates throughout the three-week testing duration (ICC=
   -1.153-0.105). The overlap of ICC 95\% confidence intervals suggested
   that IHI indices using MEP amplitude vs. area measures did not differ
   with respect to reliability.
   Conclusions: IHI indices demonstrated varying magnitudes of reliability
   irrespective of MEP quantification method. Several strategies for
   improving IHI index measurement reliability are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Vinyl monomers from soybean, sunflower, linseed, and olive oils were
   copolymerized with styrene (St), methyl methacrylate (MMA), and vinyl
   acetate (VAc) to determine the reactivity of biobased monomers in
   radical copolymerization, as well as their feasibility in emulsion
   processes for the synthesis of biobased latexes. Radical
   copolymerization of plant-oil-based monomers is described with the
   classical Mayo-Lewis equation. Using emulsion (or miniemulsion)
   polymerization with MMA or VAc, stable aqueous polymer dispersions with
   latex particles measuring 80-160 nm and containing 3-35 wt \% of
   biobased monomer units were successfully synthesized. The number-average
   molecular weight of the latex copolymers (20 000-150 000) decreases by
   increasing the degree of unsaturation in monomers and their content in
   the reaction feed. The presence of plant-oil-based fragments changes the
   T-g of resulting copolymers from 105 to 79 degrees C in copolymerization
   with MMA and from 30 to 11 degrees C in copolymerization with Vac. As a
   result, biobased units provide considerable flexibility (elongation at
   break of about 250\%) and improve the toughness of the normally rigid
   and brittle poly(MMA). Even a small amount (2-5\%) of biobased fragments
   incorporated into the structure of poly(VAc) significantly improves
   water resistance and provides hydrophobicity to the resulting polymer
   latex films. The obtained results clearly indicate that the vinyl
   monomers from plant oils can be considered as good candidates for
   internal plasticization of polymeric materials through reducing
   intermolecular interactions in copolymers.}},

Abstract = {{Recognition and manipulation of graphene edges enable the control of
   physical properties of graphene-based devices. Recently, the authors
   have identified a peptide that preferentially binds to graphene edges
   from a combinatorial peptide library. In this study, the authors examine
   the functional basis for the edge binding peptide using experimental and
   computational methods. The effect of amino acid substitution, sequence
   context, and solution pH value on the binding of the peptide to graphene
   has been investigated. The N-terminus glutamic acid residue plays a key
   role in recognizing and binding to graphene edges. The protonation,
   substitution, and positional context of the glutamic acid residue impact
   graphene edge-binding. Our findings provide insights into the binding
   mechanisms and the design of peptides for recognizing and
   functionalizing graphene edges. (C) 2016 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Aims Pre- and post-evaluations of implantable cardiac devices require
   innovative and critical testing in all phases of the design process. The
   Visible Heart (R) Project was successfully launched in 1997 and 3 years
   later the Atlas of Human Cardiac Anatomy website was online. The Visible
   Heart (R) methodologies and Atlas website can be used to better
   understand human cardiac anatomy, disease states and/or to improve
   cardiac device design throughout the development process.
   Methods and results To date, Visible (R) Heart methodologies have been
   used to reanimate 75 human hearts, all considered non-viable for
   transplantation. The Atlas is a unique free-access website featuring
   novel images of functional and fixed human cardiac anatomies from > 400
   human heart specimens. Furthermore, this website includes education
   tutorials on anatomy, physiology, congenital heart disease and various
   imaging modalities. For instance, the Device Tutorial provides examples
   of commonly deployed devices that were present at the time of in vitro
   reanimation or were subsequently delivered, including: leads, catheters,
   valves, annuloplasty rings, leadless pacemakers and stents. Another
   section of the website displays 3D models of vasculature, blood volumes,
   and/or tissue volumes reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) and
   magnetic resonance images (MRI) of various heart specimens. A new
   section allows the user to interact with various heart models.
   Conclusion Visible Heart (R) methodologies have enabled our laboratory
   to reanimate 75 human hearts and visualize functional cardiac anatomies
   and device/tissue interfaces. The website freely shares all images,
   video clips and CT/MRI DICOM files in honour of the generous gifts
   received from donors and their families.}},

Abstract = {{Benefiting from technological advances in the smart grid era,
   next-generation multi-input multi-output (MIMO) communication systems
   are expected to be powered by renewable energy sources (RES) integrated
   in the distribution grid, thus realizing the vision of ``green
   communications.{''} However, penetration of renewables introduces
   variabilities in the traditional power system, making RES benefits
   achievable only after appropriately mitigating their inherently high
   variability, which challenges existing resource allocation strategies.
   Aligned with this goal, an infinite time-horizon resource allocation
   problem is formulated to maximize the time-average MIMO downlink
   throughput, subject to a time-average energy cost budget. By using the
   advanced time decoupling technique, a novel stochastic subgradient-based
   online control approach is developed for the resultant smart-grid
   powered communication system. It is established analytically that even
   without a priori knowledge of the independently and identically
   distributed (i.i.d.) processes involved such as channel coefficients,
   renewables, and electricity prices, the proposed online control
   algorithm is still able to yield a feasible and asymptotically optimal
   solution. Numerical results further demonstrate that the proposed
   algorithm also works well in non-i.i.d. scenarios, where the underlying
   randomness is highly correlated over time.}},

Title = {{Design and Hydrologic Performance of a Tile Drainage Treatment Wetland
   in Minnesota, USA}},
Journal = {{WATER}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Treatment wetlands are increasingly needed to remove nitrate from
   agricultural drainage water to protect downstream waters, such as the
   Gulf of Mexico. This project sought to develop a new edge-of-field
   treatment wetland, designed to remove nitrate-nitrogen and enhance
   phosphorus removal by plant harvest and to monitor its effectiveness. A
   0.10 ha wetland was designed and installed to treat subsurface drainage
   flow from farmland in southwestern Minnesota, USA, in 2013, and
   monitored for three years by recording flow, nitrate-nitrogen, total
   phosphorus (TP) and soluble orthophosphorus (OP) input to and output
   from the wetland. Prior to construction, a level-pool routing, mass
   balance approach with DRAINMOD flow inputs was used to predict nitrate
   removal efficiency. Nitrate load removal averaged 68\% over three years,
   nearly matching model predictions. However, most denitrification
   occurred in the sub-soil of the wetland rather than in surface flow as
   predicted. Phosphorus removal was approximately 76\% over three years,
   and phosphorus removed by plant uptake exceeded inflow mass in the third
   year. The edge-of-field design has potential as a cost-effective method
   to treat field outflows because agricultural landowners can adopt this
   treatment system with minimal loss of productive farmland. The
   wet-prairie vegetation and shallow depth also provide the opportunity to
   remove additional phosphorus via vegetative harvest.}},

Abstract = {{Parallel programming introduces notoriously difficult bugs, usually
   referred to as concurrency bugs. This article investigates the potential
   for deviating from the conventional wisdom of writing concurrency
   bug-free, parallel programs. It explores the benefit of accepting buggy

   tolerance of emerging parallel applications to inaccuracy in
   computations. Under algorithmic noise tolerance, a new class of
   concurrency bugs, accuracy bugs, degrade the accuracy of computation
   (often at acceptable levels) rather than causing catastrophic
   termination. This study demonstrates how embracing accuracy bugs affects
   the application output quality and performance and analyzes the impact
   on execution semantics.}},

Abstract = {{Electret HVAC filter are widely used to remove airborne particles in
   residential or commercial indoor environments. Based on the
   International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) deposition
   model, sub-500 nm particles have enhanced depositions in the
   tracheobronchial region and the alveolar region than particles larger
   than 500 nm. In this study, filtration efficiencies of five residential
   electret HVAC filters against monodisperse silver (Ag) and potassium
   chloride (KCl) particles with 3-500 nm diameters at face velocities
   ranging 0.05-1.5 m s(-1) were investigated. For further understanding
   the effect of fiber charges on particle collections, electret media were
   discharged and the efficiencies acquired from pure mechanical mechanisms
   were compared with that of electret media. The figure of merit (FOM) of
   the five electret filter media was also investigated to further
   understand the effect of charge density on filtration performance. A
   theoretical model without parametric fittings used in literature was
   adopted and further modified by considering the polarization forces for
   charged particles. The modified model predicted the particle
   penetrations very well at low face velocities for all tested media and
   also well at high face velocities for the media with low charges. The
   discrepancy occurred for the media with high charges at higher face
   velocities was due to the nonuniform particle concentration distribution
   in the media layers. The validated model is able to be applied to
   improve the design for electret media for nanoparticle removal.}},

Title = {{Beat Frequency Detector-Based High-Speed True Random Number Generators:
   Statistical Modeling and Analysis}},
Journal = {{ACM JOURNAL ON EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{True random number generators (TRNGs) are crucial components for the
   security of cryptographic systems. In contrast to pseudo-random number
   generators (PRNGs), TRNGs provide higher security by extracting
   randomness from physical phenomena. To evaluate a TRNG, statistical
   properties of the circuit model and raw bitstream should be studied. In
   this article, a model for the beat frequency detector-based high-speed
   TRNG (BFD-TRNG) is proposed. The parameters of the model are extracted
   from the experimental data of a test chip. A statistical analysis of the
   proposed model is carried out to derive mean and variance of the counter
   values of the TRNG. Our statistical analysis results show that mean of
   the counter values is inversely proportional to the frequency difference
   of the two ring oscillators (ROSCs), whereas the dynamic range of the
   counter values increases linearly with standard deviation of
   environmental noise and decreases with increase of the frequency
   difference. Without the measurements from the test data, a model cannot
   be created; similarly, without a model, performance of a TRNG cannot be
   predicted. The key contribution of the proposed approach lies in fitting
   the model to measured data and the ability to use the model to predict
   performance of BFD-TRNGs that have not been fabricated. Several novel
   alternate BFD-TRNG architectures are also proposed; these include
   parallel BFD, cascade BFD, and parallel-cascade BFD. These TRNGs are
   analyzed using the proposed model, and it is shown that the parallel BFD
   structure requires less area per bit, whereas the cascade BFD structure
   has a larger dynamic range while maintaining the same mean of the
   counter values as the original BFD-TRNG. It is shown that 3.25M and 4M
   random bits can be obtained per counter value from parallel BFD and
   parallel-cascade BFD, respectively, where M counter values are computed
   in parallel. Furthermore, the statistical analysis results illustrate
   that BFD-TRNGs have better randomness and less cost per bit than other
   existing ROSC-TRNG designs. For example, it is shown that BFD-TRNGs
   accumulate 150\% more jitter than the original two-oscillator TRNG and
   that parallel BFD-TRNGs require one-third power and one-half area for
   same number of random bits for a specified period.}},

Title = {{Chemistry, growth kinetics, and epitaxial stabilization of Sn2+ in

Journal = {{APL MATERIALS}},

Abstract = {{PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics have impressive electroactive properties,
   originating from the Pb2+ 6s(2) electron lone-pair, which cause large
   elastic distortion and electric polarization due to cooperative pseudo
   Jahn-Teller effect. Recently, tin-based perovskite oxide (SnTiO3)
   containing Sn2+ and a chemistry similar to that of the 6s(2) lone-pair
   has been identified as a thermally stable, environmentally friendly
   substitute for PbTiO3-based ferroelectrics. However experimental
   attempts to stabilize Sn2+ on the A-site of perovskite ATiO(3) have so
   far failed. In this work, we report on the growth of atomically smooth,
   epitaxial, and coherent Sn-alloyed SrTiO3 films on SrTiO3 (001)
   substrates using a hybrid molecular beam epitaxy approach. With
   increasing Sn concentration, the out-of-plane lattice parameter first
   increases in accordance with the Vegard's law and then decreases for
   Sn/(Sr+Ti+Sn) at. \% ratio > 0.1 due to the incorporation of Sn2+ at the
   A-site. Using a combination of high-resolution X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and density functional calculations, we show that while
   majority of Sn is on the B-site, there is a quantitatively unknown
   fraction of Sn being consistent with the A-site occupancy making SrTiO3
   polar. A relaxor-like ferroelectric local distortion with monoclinic
   symmetry, induced by A-site Sn2+, was observed in Sn-doped SrTiO3 with
   Sn/(Sr+Ti+Sn) at. \% ratio = 0.1 using optical second harmonic
   generation measurements. The role of growth kinetics on the stability of
   Sn2+ in SrTiO3 is discussed. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Combined source-imaging techniques and directional
   connectivity analysis can provide useful information about the
   underlying brain networks in a noninvasive fashion. Source-imaging
   techniques have been used successfully to either determine the source of
   activity or to extract source time-courses for Granger causality
   analysis, previously. In this work, we utilize source-imaging algorithms
   to both find the network nodes {[}regions of interest (ROI)] and then
   extract the activation time series for further Granger causality
   analysis. The aim of this work is to find network nodes objectively from
   noninvasive electromagnetic signals, extract activation time-courses,
   and apply Granger analysis on the extracted series to study brain
   networks under realistic conditions. Methods: Source-imaging methods are
   used to identify network nodes and extract time-courses and then Granger
   causality analysis is applied to delineate the directional functional
   connectivity of underlying brain networks. Computer simulations studies
   where the underlying network (nodes and connectivity pattern) is known
   were performed; additionally, this approach has been evaluated in
   partial epilepsy patients to study epilepsy networks from interictal and
   ictal signals recorded by EEG and/or Magnetoencephalography (MEG).
   Results: Localization errors of network nodes are less than 5 mm and
   normalized connectivity errors of similar to 20\% in estimating
   underlying brain networks in simulation studies. Additionally, two focal
   epilepsy patients were studied and the identified nodes driving the
   epileptic network were concordant with clinical findings from
   intracranial recordings or surgical resection. Conclusion: Our study
   indicates that combined source-imaging algorithms with Granger causality
   analysis can identify underlying networks precisely (both in terms of
   network nodes location and internodal connectivity). Significance: The
   combined source imaging and Granger analysis technique is an effective
   tool for studying normal or pathological brain conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The exact-repair regenerating codes for distributed storage system are
   studied in this work. A novel coding scheme is proposed for code
   construction for any (n, k, d = k) system. It is shown that the proposed
   codes are optimum, in the sense that any operating point satisfying the
   lower bound for the storage-bandwidth trade-off can be achieved with the
   proposed construction. As a consequence, the optimum linear trade-off of
   exact-regenerating system is fully characterized for any systems with d
   = k. The proposed codes are linear, and can be generated by
   multiplication of an encoder matrix with a so-called data matrix. The
   exact regenerating property is provided based on fundamental properties
   of matrix determinants, and in particular, generalized Laplace expansion
   for determinant. Thus the code is called determinant code. Importantly,
   the field size required for this code construction is Theta(n), the
   total number of nodes in the system.}},

Abstract = {{A nonlinear filtering approach to imaging the dynamics of microbubble
   ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) in microvessels is presented. The
   approach is based on the adaptive third-order Volterra filter (TVF),
   which separates the linear, quadratic, and cubic components from
   beamformed pulse-echo ultrasound data. The TVF captures polynomial
   nonlinearities utilizing the full spectral components of the echo data
   and not from prespecified bands, e.g., second or third harmonics. This
   allows for imaging using broadband pulse transmission to preserve the
   axial resolution and the SNR. In this paper, we present the results from
   imaging the UCA activity in a 200-mu m cellulose tube embedded in a
   tissue-mimicking phantom using a linear array diagnostic probe. The
   contrast enhancement was quantified by computing the contrast-to-tissue
   ratio (CTR) for the different imaging components, i.e., B-mode, pulse
   inversion (PI), and the TVF components. The temporal mean and standard
   deviation of the CTR values were computed for all frames in a given data
   set. Quadratic and cubic images, referred to as QB-mode and CB-mode,
   produced higher mean CTR values than B-mode, which showed improved
   sensitivity. Compared with PI, they produced similar or higher mean CTR
   values with greater spatial specificity. We also report in vivo results
   from imaging UCA activity in an implanted LNCaP tumor with heterogeneous
   perfusion. The temporal means and standard deviations of the
   echogenicity were evaluated in small regions with different perfusion
   levels in the presence and absence of UCA. The in vivo measurements
   behaved consistently with the corresponding calculations obtained under
   microflow conditions in vitro. Specifically, the nonlinear VF components
   produced larger increases in the temporal mean and standard deviation
   values compared with B-mode in regions with low to relatively high
   perfusion. These results showed that polynomial filters such as the TVF
   can provide an important tool for imaging UCA activity in regions with
   heterogeneous perfusion as is the case in some tumors and ischemic
   tissues.}},

Abstract = {{On December 16, 2013, right after the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR)
   reached its highest annual water level, a powerful M5.1 earthquake
   occurred in Badong County, China's Hubei Province. The epicenter is 5.5
   km away from the upstream boundary and 100 km from the dam. Was this
   earthquake triggered by the impoundment of the TGR, and what are its
   subsequences? To answer these questions, we constructed a coupled
   three-dimensional poroelastic finite element model to examine the ground
   surface deformation, the Coulomb failure stress change (Delta CFS) due
   to the variation of elastic stress and pore pressure, and the elastic
   strain energy potential accumulation in the TGR region upon the
   occurrence of this event. Our calculated maximum surface deformation
   values beneath the TGR compare well with GPS observations, which
   validates our numerical model. At the hypocenter of the earthquake,
   Delta CFS is around 8.0 similar to 11.0 kPa, revealing that it may be
   eventually triggered by the impoundment. We also discovered that the
   total elastic strain energy potential accumulation due to the impounded
   water load is around 1.7 x 10(12) J, merely equivalent to 0.01\% of the
   total energy released by this event, indicating that this earthquake is
   predominately controlled by the typical regional tectonic settings as
   well as the weak fault zones, and the reservoir impoundment might only
   facilitate its procedure or occurrence. Furthermore, the stress level in
   this region remains high after this earthquake and the subsequent
   reservoir-triggered micro-seismicity or even bigger event are highly
   possible. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A disjunctive convex programming approach to the pollution-routing

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Pages = {{61-79}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The pollution-routing problem (PRP) aims to determine a set of routes
   and speed over each leg of the routes simultaneously to minimize the
   total operational and environmental costs. A common approach to solve
   the PRP exactly is through speed discretization, i.e., assuming that
   speed over each arc is chosen from a prescribed set of values. In this
   paper, we keep speed as a continuous decision variable within an
   interval and propose new formulations for the PRP. In particular, we
   build two mixed-integer convex optimization models for the PRP, by
   employing tools from disjunctive convex programming. These are the first
   arc-based formulations for the PRP with continuous speed. We also derive
   several families of valid inequalities to further strengthen both
   models. We test the proposed formulations on benchmark instances. Some
   instances are solved to optimality for the first time. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Acidic properties of beta-Mo2C, alpha-Mo2C, W2C, and WC were quantified
   by assessing the kinetics of isopropanol (IPA) dehydration at 415 K
   either (i) under inert He/Ar atmosphere or (ii) with 13 kPa O-2 co-feed.
   Dehydration kinetics were zero-order with respect to IPA for all
   catalysts and under all reaction conditions. Intrinsic activation
   energies were similar across all catalysts (89-104 kJ mol(-1)). Acid
   site densities calculated via in situ 2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine (DTBP)
   titration were used to normalize dehydration turnover frequencies (TOF).
   O-2 co-feed increased dehydration rates per gram by an order of
   magnitude for all catalysts tested, but TOF remained invariant within a
   factor of similar to 2. Mo- and W-based carbides showed similar
   dehydration kinetics regardless of O-2 co-feed, and O-2 co-feed did not
   alter bulk carbidic structure as noted by X-ray diffraction. Bronsted
   acid site provenance results from the oxophilicity of Mo and W carbides.

Abstract = {{Shape memory alloys that produce and recover from large deformation
   driven by martensitic transformation are widely exploited in biomedical
   devices and micro actuators. Generally their actuation work degrades
   significantly within first a few cycles and is reduced at smaller
   dimensions. Further, alloys exhibiting unprecedented reversibility have
   relatively small superelastic strain, 0.7\%. These raise the questions
   of whether high reversibility is necessarily accompanied by small work
   and strain and whether high work and strain is necessarily diminished at
   small scale. Here we conclusively demonstrate that these are not true by
   showing that Au30Cu25Zn45 pillars exhibit 12 MJ m(-3) work and 3.5\%
   superelastic strain even after 100 000 phase transformation cycles. Our
   findings confirm that the lattice compatibility dominates the mechanical
   behavior of phase-changing materials at nano to micron scales and points
   a way for smart microactuators design having the mutual benefits of high
   actuation work and long lifetime.}},

Abstract = {{We present a novel plasmonic antenna structure, a split-wedge antenna,
   created by splitting an ultrasharp metallic wedge with a nanogap
   perpendicular to its apex. The nanogap can tightly confine gap plasmons
   and boost the local optical field intensity in and around these opposing
   metallic wedge tips. This three-dimensional split wedge antenna
   integrates the key features of nanogaps and sharp tips, i.e., tight
   field confinement and three-dimensional nanofocusing, respectively, into
   a single platform. We fabricate split-wedge antennas with gaps that are
   as small as 1 nm in width at the wafer scale by combining silicon
   V-grooves with template stripping and atomic layer lithography. Computer
   simulations show that the field enhancement and confinement are stronger
   at the tip-gap interface compared to what standalone tips or nanogaps
   produce, with electric field amplitude enhancement factors exceeding 50
   when near-infrared light is focused on the tip-gap geometry. The
   resulting nanometric hotspot volume is on the order of lambda(3)/10(6).
   Experimentally, Raman enhancement factors exceeding 10(7) are observed
   from a 2 nm gap split-wedge antenna, demonstrating its potential for
   sensing and spectroscopy applications.}},

Abstract = {{A highly soluble cocrystal of a poorly soluble drug has the potential to
   improve the dissolution rate and bioavailability. Reaping the potential
   dissolution advantage of soluble cocrystals is challenged by the

   carbamazepine nicotinamide cocrystal, we show that the use of excess
   coformer can be an effective strategy for eliminating precipitation
   during dissolution by taking advantage of the ``common coformer
   effect{''}. When excess coformer is present, the solubility of the
   cocrystal is depressed, which leads to a lower degree of super
   saturation. At an appropriate level, precipitation can be prevented and
   improved dissolution is realized.}},

Abstract = {{We study two new informative path planning problems that are motivated
   by the use of aerial and ground robots in precision agriculture. The
   first problem, termed sampling traveling salesperson problem with
   neighborhoods (SAMPLINGTSPN), is motivated by scenarios in which
   unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are used to obtain time-consuming soil
   measurements. The input in SAMPLINGTSPN is a set of possibly overlapping
   disks. The objective is to choose a sampling location in each disk and a
   tour to visit the set of sampling locations so as to minimize the sum of
   the travel and measurement times. The second problem concerns obtaining
   the maximum number of aerial measurements using an unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) with limited energy. We study the scenario in which the
   two types of robots form a symbiotic system-the UAV lands on the UGV,
   and the UGV transports the UAV between deployment locations. This paper
   makes the following contributions. First, we present an O(r(max)/r(min))
   approximation algorithm for SAMPLINGTSPN, where r(min) and r(max) are
   the minimum and maximum radii of input disks. Second, we show how to
   model the UAV planning problem using a metric graph and formulate an
   orienteering instance to which a known approximation algorithm can be
   applied. Third, we apply the two algorithms to the problem of obtaining
   ground and aerial measurements in order to accurately estimate a
   nitrogen map of a plot. Along with theoretical results, we present
   results from simulations conducted using real soil data and preliminary
   field experiments with the UAV.}},

Abstract = {{The wind-wave-ocean system, which contains complex interactive
   processes, is of great importance for the momentum, heat and mass
   transport in the atmosphere and ocean and at their interface. In this
   work, we perform wave-coupled phase-resolved numerical simulations to
   investigate the effect of progressive gravity waves on wind and ocean
   turbulence. Initially homogeneous turbulence under a finite-amplitude
   monochromatic surface wave is simulated to reveal how the wave
   influences the subsurface turbulence. For the interaction between
   wind-driven waves and shear turbulence in the ocean, new
   wave-phase-resolved simulation approaches are developed to capture
   Langmuir cells. Lastly, wind turbulence over one and two progressive

Abstract = {{In this study, we consider a two-retailer, one-supplier supply chain in
   which retailers satisfy excess demand by offering to directly ship
   out-of-stock items on an expedited basis at no extra cost to customers.
   This practice is referred to as the fast-ship option. We consider two
   scenarios along with the fast-ship option. In the first scenario,
   retailers transship when out of stock, whereas in the second scenario,
   they do not. If they do not transship, some customers may perform the
   search on their own. In each scenario, the wholesale prices are either
   exogenous, or chosen endogenously by the supplier. For both cases, we
   determine the supplier's and the retailers' optimal decisions. The key
   research question we ask and answer is the following: which of the two
   scenarios is preferred by either player when all decisions are made
   optimally? We show that when fewer customers are willing to search on
   their own and wholesale prices are exogenous, both the supplier and the
   retailers prefer to transship. In addition, the decision maker in a
   centralized chain will have the exact same preference as that of players
   in a decentralized setting when the retailers' and the supplier's
   preferences coincide and wholesale prices are exogenous. This preference
   concordance does not hold if wholesale prices are endogenous.}},

Abstract = {{Implementation of the solar thermochemical ceria redox cycle to split
   water and carbon dioxide depends in part on the morphological stability
   of a porous ceria substrate and the ability to acquire porous substrate
   in high volume. Here we evaluate the evolution of morphology and fuel
   production of ceria particles formed of fibers in a commercially
   relevant manufacturing process. The particles are evaluated over 1000
   CO2-splitting cycles (56 h) at 1773 K followed by sixteen
   temperature-swing cycles (5.7 h) with oxidation at 1073 K. New particles
   are 78\% porous with a specific surface area of 0.14 m(2) g(-1) and a
   grain size of 3.7 m. During isothermal cycling, the morphology
   stabilized after 500 cycles (28 h) to 73\% porosity, a surface face 0.08
   m(2) g(-1) and a grain size of 8 The stabilized particles retained 89\%
   of the peak cycle average rate of CO production. During
   temperature-swing cycling, the specific surface area decreased to 0.06
   m(2) g(-1). The mass-produced fibrous structures have adequately stable
   morphologies to produce fuel production performance similar to less

Abstract = {{Catalytic fast pyrolysis is one of the most promising and prevailing
   technologies for the improvement of bio-oil quality. In this
   contribution, catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of mushroom waste and waste
   oil over HZSM-5 zeolite catalyst was conducted to promote the production
   of aromatics using pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. The
   effects of pyrolysis temperature and waste oil to mushroom waste mass
   ratio on the pyrolytic product distribution were investigated and
   analyzed. The results showed that with temperature increasing, the
   relative contents of hydrocarbons increased at first and then decreased,
   and 600 A degrees C was an optimum temperature as the maximum yield of
   hydrocarbons could be reached. Besides, the waste oil to mushroom waste
   mass ratio was of great significance in the catalytic fast co-pyrolysis
   process, and the total relative contents of hydrocarbons increased with
   the increasing of waste oil to mushroom waste ratio. On the other hand,
   a significant synergistic effect between waste oil and mushroom waste
   was studied during catalytic fast co-pyrolysis, which played an
   effective role in promoting the production of aromatics remarkably.
   Catalytic fast co-pyrolysis of waste oil and mushroom waste made a
   significant contribution to the practical utilization of biomass
   pyrolysis and provided an effective and efficient way to promote the
   upgrading of bio-oil.}},

Title = {{Generating and controlling homogeneous air turbulence using random jet
   arrays}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The use of random jet arrays, already employed in water tank facilities
   to generate zero-mean-flow homogeneous turbulence, is extended to air as
   a working fluid. A novel facility is introduced that uses two facing
   arrays of individually controlled jets (256 in total) to force steady
   homogeneous turbulence with negligible mean flow, shear, and strain.
   Quasi-synthetic jet pumps are created by expanding pressurized air
   through small straight nozzles and are actuated by fast-response
   low-voltage solenoid valves. Velocity fields, two-point correlations,
   energy spectra, and second-order structure functions are obtained from
   2D PIV and are used to characterize the turbulence from the
   integral-to-the Kolmogorov scales. Several metrics are defined to
   quantify how well zero-mean-flow homogeneous turbulence is approximated
   for a wide range of forcing and geometric parameters. With increasing
   jet firing time duration, both the velocity fluctuations and the
   integral length scales are augmented and therefore the Reynolds number
   is increased. We reach a Taylor-microscale Reynolds number of 470, a
   large-scale Reynolds number of 74,000, and an integral-to-Kolmogorov
   length scale ratio of 680. The volume of the present homogeneous
   turbulence, the largest reported to date in a zero-mean-flow facility,
   is much larger than the integral length scale, allowing for the natural
   development of the energy cascade. The turbulence is found to be
   anisotropic irrespective of the distance between the jet arrays. Fine
   grids placed in front of the jets are effective at modulating the
   turbulence, reducing both velocity fluctuations and integral scales.
   Varying the jet-to-jet spacing within each array has no effect on the
   integral length scale, suggesting that this is dictated by the length
   scale of the jets.}},

Abstract = {{Severe pollution induced by traditional fossil fuels arouses great
   attention on the usage of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and renewable
   energy. However, large-scale penetration of PEVs combined with other
   kinds of appliances tends to cause excessive or even disastrous burden
   on the power grid, especially during peak hours. This paper focuses on
   the scheduling of PEVs charging process among different charging
   stations and each station can be supplied by both renewable energy
   generators and a distribution network. The distribution network also
   powers some uncontrollable loads. In order to minimize the on-grid
   energy cost with local renewable energy and non-ideal storage while
   avoiding the overload risk of the distribution network, an online
   algorithm consisting of scheduling the charging of PEVs and energy
   management of charging stations is developed based on Lyapunov
   optimization and Lagrange dual decomposition techniques. The algorithm
   can satisfy the random charging requests from PEVs with provable
   performance. Simulation results with real data demonstrate that the
   proposed algorithm can decrease the time-average cost of stations while
   avoiding overload in the distribution network in the presence of random
   uncontrollable loads.}},

Title = {{Turbulent thermal convection driven by heated inertial particles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{809}},
Pages = {{390-437}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The heating of particles in a dilute suspension, for instance by
   radiation, chemical reactions or radioactivity, leads to local
   temperature fluctuations in the fluid due to the non-uniformity of the
   disperse phase. In the presence of a gravity field, the fluid is set in
   motion by the resulting buoyancy forces. When the particle density is
   different than that of the fluid, the fluid motion alters the spatial
   distribution of the particles and possibly strengthens their
   concentration inhomogcneitics. This in turn causes more intense local
   heating. Direct numerical simulations in the Boussinesq limit show this
   feedback loop. Various regimes are identified depending on the particle
   inertia. For very small particle inertia, the macroscopic behaviour of
   the system is the result of many thermal plumes that are generated
   independently of each other. For significant particle inertia, clusters
   of particles are observed and their dynamics controls the flow. The
   emergence of very intermittent turbulent fluctuations shows that the
   flow is influenced by the larger structures (turbulent convection) as
   well as by the small-scale dynamics that affect particle segregation and
   thus the flow forcing. Assuming thermal equilibrium between the
   particles and the fluid (i.e. infinitely fast thermal relaxation of the
   particle), we investigate the evolution of statistical observables with
   the change of the main control parameters (namely the particle number
   density, the particle inertia and the domain size), and propose a
   scaling argument for these trends. Concerning the energy density in the
   spectral space, it is observed that the turbulent energy and temperature
   spectra follow a power law, the exponent of which varies continuously
   with the Stokes number. Furthermore, the study of the spectra of the
   temperature and momentum forcing (and thus of the
   concentration/temperature and velocity/temperature correlations) gives
   strong support to the proposed feedback loop mechanism. We then discuss
   the intermittency of the flow, and analyse the effect of relaxing some
   of the simplifying assumptions, thus assessing the relevance of the
   original studied configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of a model from a set of models that best describes the
   behavior of a system is of primary importance in many applications. In
   this article two discriminating signals are derived from measurements
   for a plant that switches between two model behaviors, where the
   transfer functions from inputs to the two signals are identical when one
   model is effective while they are negative of each other when the other
   model is effective. The developed detection algorithm called the
   innovation squared mismatch is utilized for the read operation of probe
   based data storage. The innovations squared mismatch method offers
   better detection performance with significantly less computational
   complexity compared to prevalently used maximum a posteriori probability
   based methods in current data storage systems. The article further
   proposes employing maximum likelihood sequence detection based methods
   where the plant behavior can switch from one model to another at high
   rates and the transients from a previous behavior affect the current
   behavior causing inter-symbol interference. Exhaustive simulation and
   experimental results corroborate the efficiency of the proposed methods.

Title = {{Improved Coefficient of Restitution Estimation for Free Rocking Members}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In 1963, a geometry-dependent approach to estimate the coefficient of
   restitution (COR) was proposed for free rocking structures. Since then,
   this estimation has been reported as being consistently lower than
   results obtained from experimental data. An assumption used by the
   original model is shown to be the cause of this underestimation.
   Identifying that the rocking takes place over a contact region, this
   study introduces a modified formulation for free rocking bodies and
   proposes an improved COR estimation to accurately quantify the energy
   dissipation of these structures. Using experimental data, it is shown
   that the improved CORs consistently provide better correlation to those
   established from tests than the COR obtained from the original approach.}},

Abstract = {{Methods to generate murine cardiomyocytes from pluripotent stem cells
   (PSCs) in vitro are resource and time intensive. All current protocols
   require exogenously provided soluble factors and almost all utilize
   embryoid body formation to modulate pathways associated with mesoderm
   specification and cardiomyocyte differentiation. Here, we developed a
   simple protocol without EBs and without exogenous soluble factors that
   enabled cardiomyocyte differentiation of a murine induced PSC line based
   on controlled nutrient deprivation in 2D monolayer cultures. We showed
   that this protocol reproducibly imposed metabolic stress and
   consequently modulated active beta-catenin levels to yield functional
   cardiomyocytes. The yield of cardiomyocytes and calcium handling
   kinetics were comparable to existing approaches. However, this approach
   did not produce consistent results between murine PSC lines suggesting
   signaling pathways linking nutrient deprivation to beta-catenin
   activation are not universally conserved and may be a remnant of the
   parent population from which the induced PSCs were derived.}},

Title = {{Engineering of a Highly Efficient Escherichia coli Strain for Mevalonate
   Fermentation through Chromosomal Integration}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{82}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{7176-7184}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chromosomal integration of heterologous metabolic pathways is optimal
   for industrially relevant fermentation, as plasmid-based fermentation
   causes extra metabolic burden and genetic instabilities. In this work,
   chromosomal integration was adapted for the production of mevalonate,
   which can be readily converted into beta-methyl-delta-valerolactone, a
   monomer for the production of mechanically tunable polyesters. The
   mevalonate pathway, driven by a constitutive promoter, was integrated
   into the chromosome of Escherichia coli to replace the native
   fermentation gene adhE or ldhA. The engineered strains (CMEV-1 and
   CMEV-2) did not require inducer or antibiotic and showed slightly higher
   maximal productivities (0.38 to similar to 0.43 g/liter/h) and yields
   (67.8 to similar to 71.4\% of the maximum theoretical yield) than those
   of the plasmid-based fermentation. Since the glycolysis pathway is the
   first module for mevalonate synthesis, atpFH deletion was employed to
   improve the glycolytic rate and the production rate of mevalonate. Shake
   flask fermentation results showed that the deletion of atpFH in CMEV-1
   resulted in a 2.1-fold increase in the maximum productivity.
   Furthermore, enhancement of the downstream pathway by integrating two
   copies of the mevalonate pathway genes into the chromosome further
   improved the mevalonate yield. Finally, our fed-batch fermentation
   showed that, with deletion of the atpFH and sucA genes and integration
   of two copies of the mevalonate pathway genes into the chromosome, the
   engineered strain CMEV-7 exhibited both high maximal productivity
   (similar to.01 g/liter/h) and high yield (86.1\% of the maximum
   theoretical yield, 30 g/liter mevalonate from 61 g/liter glucose after
   48 h in a shake flask).
   IMPORTANCE
   Metabolic engineering has succeeded in producing various chemicals.
   However, few of these chemicals are commercially competitive with the
   conventional petroleum-derived materials. In this work, chromosomal
   integration of the heterologous pathway and subsequent optimization
   strategies ensure stable and efficient (i.e., high-titer, high-yield,
   and high-productivity) production of mevalonate, which demonstrates the
   potential for scale-up fermentation. Among the optimization strategies,
   we demonstrated that enhancement of the glycolytic flux significantly
   improved the productivity. This result provides an example of how to
   tune the carbon flux for the optimal production of exogenous chemicals.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate estimation of total nitrogen loads is essential for evaluating
   conditions in the aquatic environment. Extrapolation of estimates beyond
   measured streams will greatly expand our understanding of total nitrogen
   loading to streams. Recursive partitioning and random forest regression
   were used to assess 85 geospatial, environmental, and watershed
   variables across 636 small (< 585 km(2)) watersheds to determine which
   variables are fundamentally important to the estimation of annual loads
   of total nitrogen. Initial analysis led to the splitting of watersheds
   into three groups based on predominant land use (agricultural,
   developed, and undeveloped). Nitrogen application, agricultural and
   developed land area, and impervious or developed land in the 100-m
   stream buffer were commonly extracted variables by both recursive
   partitioning and random forest regression. A series of multiple linear
   regression equations utilizing the extracted variables were created and
   applied to the watersheds. As few as three variables explained as much
   as 76 \% of the variability in total nitrogen loads for watersheds with
   predominantly agricultural land use. Catchment-scale national maps were
   generated to visualize the total nitrogen loads and yields across the
   USA. The estimates provided by these models can inform water managers
   and help identify areas where more in-depth monitoring may be
   beneficial.}},

Abstract = {{Reasoning about functions that operate over algebraic data types is an
   important problem for a large variety of applications. One application
   of particular interest is network applications that manipulate or reason
   about complex message structures, such as XML messages. This paper
   presents a decision procedure for reasoning about algebraic data types
   using abstractions that are provided by catamorphisms: fold functions
   that map instances of algebraic data types to values in a decidable
   domain. We show that the procedure is sound and complete for a class of
   catamorphisms that satisfy a generalized sufficient surjectivity
   condition. Our work extends a previous decision procedure that unrolls
   catamorphism functions until a solution is found. We use the generalized
   sufficient surjectivity condition to address an incompleteness in the
   previous unrolling algorithm (and associated proof). We then propose the
   categories of monotonic and associative catamorphisms, which we argue
   provide a more intuitive inclusion test than the generalized sufficient
   surjectivity condition. We use these notions to address two open
   problems from previous work: (1) we provide a bound, with respect to
   formula size, on the number of unrollings necessary for completeness,
   showing that it is linear for monotonic catamorphisms and exponentially
   small for associative catamorphisms, and (2) we demonstrate that
   associative catamorphisms can be combined within a formula while
   preserving completeness. Our combination results extend the set of
   problems that can be reasoned about using the catamorphism-based
   approach. We also describe an implementation of the approach, called
   RADA, which accepts formulas in an extended version of the SMT-LIB 2.0
   syntax. The procedure is quite general and is central to the reasoning
   infrastructure for Guardol, a domain-specific language for reasoning
   about network guards.}},

Title = {{Dynamic wetting failure and hydrodynamic assist in curtain coating}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{808}},
Pages = {{290-315}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic wetting failure in curtain coating of Newtonian liquids is
   studied in this work. A hydrodynamic model accounting for air flow near
   the dynamic contact line (DCL) is developed to describe two-dimensional
   (2D) steady wetting and to predict the onset of wetting failure. A
   hybrid approach is used where air is described by a one-dimensional
   model and liquid by a 2D model, and the resulting hybrid formulation is
   solved with the Galerkin finite element method. The results reveal that
   the delay of wetting failure in curtain coating - often termed
   hydrodynamic assist - mainly arises from the hydrodynamic pressure
   generated by the inertia of the impinging curtain. This pressure leads
   to a strong capillary-stress gradient that pumps air away from the DCL
   and thus increases the critical substrate speed for wetting failure.
   Although the parameter values used in the model are different from those
   in experiments due to computational limitations, the model is able to
   capture the experimentally observed non-monotonic behaviour of the
   critical substrate speed as the feed flow rate increases (Blake et al.,
   Phys. Fluids, vol. 11, 1999, p. 1995-2007). The influence of insoluble
   surfactants is also investigated, and the results show that Marangoni
   stresses tend to thin the air film and increase air-pressure gradients
   near the DCL, thereby promoting the onset of wetting failure. In
   addition, Marangoni stresses reduce the degree of hydrodynamic assist in
   curtain coating, suggesting a possible mechanism for experimental
   observations reported by Marston et al. (Exp. Fluids, vol. 46, 2009, pp.
   549-558).}},

Abstract = {{In the U.S., the total amount of municipal solid waste is continuously
   rising each year. Millions of tons of solid waste and scum are produced
   annually that require safe and environmentally sound disposal. The
   availability of a zero-cost energy source like municipal waste scum is
   ideal for several types of renewable energy technologies. However, the
   way the energy is produced, distributed and valued also contributes to
   the overall process sustainability. An economic screening method was
   developed to compare the potential energy and economic value of three
   waste-to-energy technologies; incineration, anaerobic digestion, and
   biodiesel. A St. Paul, MN wastewater treatment facility producing 3175
   ``wet{''} kilograms of scum per day was used as a basis of the
   comparison. After applying all theoretically available subsidies, scum
   to biodiesel was shown to have the greatest economic potential, valued
   between \$491,949 and \$610,624/ year. The incineration of scum yielded
   the greatest reclaimed energy potential at 29 billion kilojoules/ year.

Abstract = {{This paper considers phase retrieval from the magnitude of
   one-dimensional over-sampled Fourier measurements, a classical problem
   that has challenged researchers in various fields of science and
   engineering. We show that an optimal vector in a least-squares sense can
   be found by solving a convex problem, thus establishing a hidden
   convexity in Fourier phase retrieval. We then show that the standard
   semidefinite relaxation approach yields the optimal cost function value
   (albeit not necessarily an optimal solution). A method is then derived
   to retrieve an optimal minimum phase solution in polynomial time. Using
   these results, a new measuring technique is proposed which guarantees
   uniqueness of the solution, along with an efficient algorithm that can
   solve large-scale Fourier phase retrieval problems with uniqueness and
   optimality guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers volume minimization (VolMin)-based structured
   matrix factorization. VolMin is a factorization criterion that
   decomposes a given data matrix into a basis matrix times a structured
   coefficient matrix via finding the minimum-volume simplex that encloses
   all the columns of the data matrix. Recent work showed that VolMin
   guarantees the identifiability of the factor matrices under mild
   conditions that are realistic in a wide variety of applications. This
   paper focuses on both theoretical and practical aspects of VolMin. On
   the theory side, exact equivalence of two independently developed
   sufficient conditions for VolMin identifiability is proven here, thereby
   providing a more comprehensive understanding of this aspect of VolMin.
   On the algorithm side, computational complexity and sensitivity to
   outliers are two key challenges associated with real-world applications
   of VolMin. These are addressed here via a new VolMin algorithm that
   handles volume regularization in a computationally simple way, and
   automatically detects and iteratively downweights outliers,
   simultaneously. Simulations and real-data experiments using a remotely
   sensed hyperspectral image and the Reuters document corpus are employed
   to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Pages = {{294-300}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The present work reports some interesting gas entrainment behaviors in
   the formation and collapse of a ventilated supercavity under steady and
   unsteady flow conditions. Our experiments show that the gas entrainment
   required to establish a supercavity are much greater than the minimum
   gas entrainment required to sustain it, and these gas entrainment values
   depend on Froude (Fr) number, cavitator size and the flow unsteadiness.
   Specifically, the measurements of the formation gas entrainment
   coefficients under different Fr numbers indicate that it does not
   monotonically increase with Fr but displays increasing and decreasing
   trends in different regimes of Fr. On the other hand, the collapse air
   entrainment coefficient initially decreases with Fr and then approaches
   to a constant. Similar trends of formation and collapse gas entrainment
   coefficient are observed for different cavitator sizes. Moreover, the
   introduction of unsteady gusts causes a slight monotonic increase in the
   formation and collapse gas entrainment requirements. Our study points
   out the crucial factors to be considered in the estimation of gas
   storage requirements for a ventilated supercavitating vehicle. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{In-cylinder reforming of a gasoline pilot fuel injection during the
   negative valve overlap (NVO) period of an engine cycle can be used to
   alter the fuel-air mixture reactivity in low-temperature gasoline
   combustion (LTGC). In the present study, the impact of the NVO reformate
   on main-period engine performance was evaluated experimentally for four
   single-component surrogate gasoline fuels (iso-octane, n-heptane,
   ethanol, and 1-hexene) using a custom alternate-fire sequence. For each
   fuel, the NVO injection mass was held constant as the main-period
   injection mass was varied. The constant NVO injection mass allowed the
   NVO reformate product stream to be separately characterized in detail
   using photoionization mass spectrometry (PIMS). PIMS measurements were
   performed to characterize the NVO reformates of the four fuels used for
   main-period engine performance testing, as well as two additional fuels:
   cyclohexane and a toluene/n-heptane blend. All experiments were
   conducted using a direct-injection, single-cylinder research engine
   equipped with a custom dump valve apparatus used to perform bulk gas
   sampling at the end of the NVO period. A constant volume, adiabatic,
   single-zone reactor model with detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms was
   used to evaluate the reactivity of each NVO reformate compared to the
   unreformed parent fuel, the impact of specific species on reformate
   reactivity, and to examine the factors that influence main-period engine
   performance. The PIMS measurements and reactor model analysis indicated
   that all tested fuels (except n-heptane) exhibit increased reformate
   reactivity as compared to the unreacted parent fuel through production
   of more reactive species, namely acetylene, acetaldehyde, propene, and
   allene. Main-period engine performance was impacted by changes in
   reactivity from the reformate fraction of total fueling and compressed
   temperature (through the ratio of specific heats and differences in
   charge cooling from the main injection). iso-Octane was found to have
   the largest benefit in reactivity as the reformate fraction of total
   fueling increased. Alternatively, increases in reactivity for ethanol
   were primarily due to decreased charge cooling while reactivity
   increases for 1-hexene were dictated by increased ratio of specific
   heats. This paper demonstrates that NVO-generated reformate can improve
   main-period reactivity through both chemical and thermal effects,
   although significant NVO-period heat losses reduce total-cycle engine
   thermal efficiency. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the pricing strategies for personalized product
   bundles. In such problems, a seller provides a variety of products for
   which customers can construct a personalized bundle and send a request
   for quote (RFQ) to the seller. The seller, after reviewing the RFQ, has
   to determine a price based on which the customer either purchases the
   whole bundle or nothing. Such problems are faced by many companies in
   practice, and they are very difficult because of the potential unlimited
   possible configurations of the bundle and the correlations among the
   individual products. In this paper, we propose a novel top-down and
   bottom-up approach to solve this problem. In the top-down step, we
   decompose the bundle into each component and calibrate a value score for
   each component. In the bottom-up step, we aggregate the components back
   to the bundle, define important features of the bundle, and segment
   different RFQs by those bundle features as well as customer attributes.
   Then we estimate a utility function for each segment based on historical
   sales data and derive an optimal price for each incoming RFQ. We show
   that such a model overcomes the aforementioned difficulties and can be
   implemented efficiently. We test our approach using empirical data from
   a major information technology service provider and the test result
   shows that the proposed approach can improve the effectiveness of
   pricing significantly.}},

Title = {{Truncation and constitutive activation of the androgen receptor by
   diverse genomic rearrangements in prostate cancer}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Molecularly targeted therapies for advanced prostate cancer include
   castration modalities that suppress ligand-dependent transcriptional
   activity of the androgen receptor (AR). However, persistent AR
   signalling undermines therapeutic efficacy and promotes progression to
   lethal castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), even when patients
   are treated with potent second-generation AR-targeted therapies
   abiraterone and enzalutamide. Here we define diverse AR genomic
   structural rearrangements (AR-GSRs) as a class of molecular alterations
   occurring in one third of CRPC-stage tumours. AR-GSRs occur in the
   context of copy-neutral and amplified AR and display heterogeneity in
   breakpoint location, rearrangement class and sub-clonal enrichment in
   tumours within and between patients. Despite this heterogeneity, one
   common outcome in tumours with high sub-clonal enrichment of AR-GSRs is
   outlier expression of diverse AR variant species lacking the
   ligand-binding domain and possessing ligand-independent transcriptional
   activity. Collectively, these findings reveal AR-GSRs as important
   drivers of persistent AR signalling in CRPC.}},

Title = {{Contact-Induced Spin Relaxation in Graphene Nonlocal Spin Valves}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{We report on a systematic study of contact-induced spin relaxation in
   gated graphene nonlocal spin valves. We demonstrate the enhancement of
   the nonlocal magnetoresistance (Delta R-NL) as the Co/ AlOx/ graphene
   interface resistance increases relative to the graphene spin resistance.
   We measure Hanle precession at many gate voltages on 14 separate
   spin-valve devices fabricated from graphene grown by chemical vapor
   deposition (CVD). These measurements are compared by normalizing Delta
   R-NL to the ideal limit of large contact resistance, and the result is
   shown to be consistent with isotropic contact-induced spin relaxation
   caused by spin current flowing from the graphene into the Co contacts.
   After accounting for this source of spin relaxation, we extract spin
   lifetimes of up to 600 ps in CVD graphene with a gate-voltage dependence
   which can be described by a combination of both Elliott-Yafet and
   D'yakonov-Perel' spin-relaxation mechanisms.}},

   Emergence of anisotropic plasmons}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{We consider the existence of plasmons in a nonequilibrium situation
   where electrons from the valence band of graphene are pumped to states
   in the Brillouin zone around the M point by a high intensity UV
   electromagnetic field. The resulting out-of-equilibrium electron gas is
   later probed by a weak electromagnetic field of different frequency. We
   show that the optical properties of the system and the dispersion of the
   plasmons are strongly anisotropic, depending on the pumping radiation
   properties: its intensity, polarization, and frequency. This anisotropy
   has its roots in the saddlelike nature of the electronic dispersion
   relation around that particular point in the Brillouin zone. It is found
   that despite the strong anisotropy, the dispersion of the plasmons
   scales with the square root of the wave number but is characterized an
   effective Fermi energy, which depends on the properties of the pumping
   radiation. Our calculations go beyond the usual Dirac cone approximation
   taking the full band structure of graphene into account. This is a
   necessary condition for discussing plasmons at the M point in the

Abstract = {{A coupling interaction between localised surface plasmon resonance of
   metal nanoparticles (NPs) and emitting materials has been shown to
   improve the internal quantum efficiency in organic light-emitting
   diodes. In this research, Ag NPs were introduced into blue polymer
   light-emitting diodes (PLEDs), which suffer from low efficiency. Ag NPs
   were attached to the indium tin oxide (ITO) surface through a
   ligand-exchange process, which guarantees well-dispersed Ag NPs, to
   maximise resonant coupling and to prevent optical and electrical side
   effects. Mercaptoacid molecules not only function as a coupling agent
   between ITO and Ag NPs, but also aid the transfer of holes by increasing
   the work function of ITO, as confirmed by tests on hole-only devices and
   by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. Maximum current efficiencies
   of blue PLEDs improved by 25\% with thioglycolic acid (TGA) only and by
   48\% with 0.302 nM Ag NPs attached to TGA. We confirmed from

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 24}},
Abstract = {{Inelastic X-ray scattering with meV energy resolution (IXS) is an ideal
   tool to measure collective excitations in solids and liquids. In
   non-resonant scattering condition, the cross-section is strongly
   dominated by lattice vibrations (phonons). However, it is possible to
   probe additional degrees of freedom such as magnetic fluctuations that
   are strongly coupled to the phonons. The IXS spectrum of the coupled
   system contains not only the phonon dispersion but also the so far
   undetected magnetic correlation function. Here we report the observation
   of strong magnon-phonon coupling in LiCrO2 that enables the measurement
   of magnetic correlations throughout the Brillouin zone via IXS. We find
   electromagnon excitations and electric dipole active two-magnon
   excitations in the magnetically ordered phase and heavily damped
   electromagnons in the paramagnetic phase of LiCrO2. We predict that
   several (frustrated) magnets with dominant direct exchange and
   non-collinear magnetism show surprisingly large IXS cross-section for
   magnons and multi-magnon processes.}},

Abstract = {{An important advance in fluid surface control was the amphiphilic
   surfactant composed of coupled molecular structures (i.e., hydrophilic
   and hydrophobic) to reduce surface tension between two distinct fluid
   phases. However, implementation of simple surfactants has been hindered
   by the broad range of applications in water containing alkaline earth
   metals (i.e., hard water), which disrupt surfactant function and require
   extensive use of undesirable and expensive chelating additives. Here we
   show that sugar-derived furans can be linked with triglyceride-derived
   fatty acid chains via Friedel-Crafts acylation within single layer (SPP)
   zeolite catalysts. These alkylfuran surfactants independently suppress
   the effects of hard water while simultaneously permitting broad
   tunability of size, structure, and function, which can be optimized for
   superior capability for forming micelles and solubilizing in water.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we developed a simple method to fabricate 12 X 4 mm(2)
   large scale nanostructure arrays and investigated the feasibility of
   indium nanodot (ND) array with different diameters and periods for
   refractive index sensing. Absorption resonances at multiple wavelengths
   from the visible to the near-infrared range were observed for various
   incident angles in a variety of media. Engineering the ND array with a
   centered square lattice, we successfully enhanced the sensitivity by
   60\% and improved the figure of merit (FOM) by 190\%. The evolution of
   the resonance dips in the reflection spectra, of square lattice and
   centered square lattice, from air to water, matches well with the
   results of Lumerical FDTD simulation. The improvement of sensitivity is
   due to the enhancement of local electromagnetic field (E-field) near the
   NDs with centered square lattice, as revealed by E-field simulation at
   resonance wavelengths. The E-field is enhanced due to coupling between
   the two square ND arrays with root 2x period at phase matching. This
   work illustrates an effective way to engineer and fabricate a refractive
   index sensor at a large scale. This is the first experimental
   demonstration of poor-metal (indium) nanostructure array for refractive
   index sensing. It also demonstrates a centered square lattice for higher
   sensitivity and as a better basic platform for more complex sensor
   designs.}},

   using exciton and polaron dynamics modeling}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Phosphorescent organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) can suffer a
   significant reduction in device efficiency under high current density
   excitation. This steady-state efficiency roll-off is frequently modeled
   by including losses from exciton-exciton and exciton-polaron quenching.
   Despite success in modeling the steady-state efficiency roll-off, the
   corresponding transient electroluminescence behavior has not been
   modeled as effectively using the same quenching processes. In this work,
   both the steady-state and transient electroluminescence behavior of
   phosphorescent OLEDs based on tris{[}2-phenylpyridinato-C2, N]
   Iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)(3)) are successfully reproduced by considering a
   dynamic polaron population. Within this model, polarons are able to
   either form excitons or leak through the device emissive layer, reducing
   the overall efficiency. This formalism permits a natural and rigorous
   connection between exciton and polaron dynamics and device charge
   balance, with the charge balance cast as the efficiency of exciton
   formation. The full dynamics model reproduces both the rise and decay of
   transient electroluminescence, as well as the full dependence of the
   external quantum efficiency on current density. Fit parameters are
   independently verified using separate studies of transient and
   steady-state photoluminescence. The model provides a complete picture
   for the dynamics present during the electrical operation of
   phosphorescent OLEDs, while also offering a direct route to elucidate
   exciton formation. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{137}},
Pages = {{667-676}},

Abstract = {{Both biofuels and bioplastics are often regarded as sustainable
   solutions to current environmental problems such as climate change,
   fossil depletion and acidification. However, both have been criticized
   for being economically costly, competing with other societally
   beneficial goods such as food, and offering limited environmental
   benefits compared to their fossil counterparts. This study provides a
   comparative environmental Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) for 100\% bio-based
   polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottles, versus fully fossil-based and
   partially bio-based PET bottles. An attributional life cycle assessment
   (aLCA) and sensitivity analysis of key assumptions is carried out to
   compare cradle-to-factory-gate impacts (i.e. feedstock extraction,
   component production and product manufacturing) of twelve PET bottle
   production scenarios. Results indicate that woody-biomass based PET
   bottles have 21\% less global warming potential and require 22\% less
   fossil fuel than their fossil based counterparts, but perform worse in
   other categories such as ecotoxicity and ozone depletion impacts.
   Results are sensitive to impact allocation assumptions as well as
   parameter input assumptions related to isobutanol production. In most
   categories, with avoided impact credits considered, forest residue
   feedstocks result in overall better environmental performance than corn
   stover feedstocks for bio-PET bottle production. The variability in
   avoided burdens could alter the relative environmental rankings for
   fossil and bio-PET bottles. Depending on the biomass feedstock,
   extraction and pre-processing are likely more emission-intensive than
   the corresponding fossil refinery processes due to the significant
   upstream emissions embodied in the application of fertilizers, and the
   significant chemical and energy inputs required to break recalcitrant
   lignocellulosic bonds. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{An array of one dimensional (1D) TiO2 nanorods (TONRs) has been regarded
   as an attractive candidate for electrochemical energy conversion and as
   storage device due to its large surface area, effiective light
   scattering, and undisturbed charge transport pathway. However, the high
   defect/trap densities on surface of the nanostructured morphology and
   architecture may generally hinder the performance enhancement by
   providing electron-hole recombination sites. Hence, the surface
   passivation of nanoarchitectures based photoelectrodes has recently
   received much attention as an effective strategy to enhance the
   charge-separation and charge-transfer processes in photoelectrochemical
   (PEC) water splitting devices. In particular, a coating layer with
   narrowing band gap materials can promote enhanced light harvesting in
   the UV-vis region as well as surface passivation, directly supplying a
   driving force for charge separation and charge transfer due to band
   alignment. In this paper, the surface of TONRs were passivated by 10 and
   30 nm thick Zn(O,S) layers with a relatively narrow band gap using an
   atomic layer deposition technique to modulate the thickness exactly. The
   10 nm Zn (O,S)/TONR array exhibits a significantly enhanced photocurrent
   density (J(sc)) of 5.94 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 eV vs NHE and an incident
   photon-toelectron conversion efficiency (IPCE) of 49\% at 374 nm
   compared with that of TONR arrays (J(sc) of 1.99 mA/cm(2) at 1.23 eV vs
   NHE and an IPCE of 20\% at 380 nm). However, the PEC performance is
   worse in the 30 nm Zn(O,S)/TONR arrays, showing a J(sc) of 3.09 mA/cm(2)
   at 1.23 eV vs NHE and an IPCE of 29\% at 374 nm. To clearly demonstrate
   these PEC behaviors, the TONR and Zn(O,S)/TONR arrays were characterized
   by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), open circuit voltage
   decay (OCV) measurement, and Xray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The
   above mentioned characterizations indicate that the enhanced PEC
   performance of the 10 nm Zn(O,S)/TONR array resulted from the (i)
   increased light harvesting in the UV-vis region, (ii) lower charge
   transfer resistance and (iii) high value of valence band offset (VBO,
   -1.44 eV) and conduction band offset (CBO, -1.2eV) than those of the
   TONR. However, the deterioration of J(sc) in the 30 nm Zn(O,S)/TONR
   array is attributed to the negative value of VBO (-0.13 eV) and positive
   value of CBO (+ 0.27 eV), as well as the higher charge transfer
   resistance to the electrolyte than that of the TONR arrays, despite of
   the improved light absorption in the visible region. The photocurrent
   densities of 10 nm Zn(O,S)/TONR and 30 nm Zn(O, S)/TONR photocathodes
   decay to 4.718 mA/cm(2) (5.90 mA/cm(2) at 0 min) and 2.212 mA/cm(2)
   (3.03 mA/cm(2) at 0 min) after 90 min, respectively, they retain of
   about similar to 80\% and 70\% of its original values. These
   experimental results and discussions not only provide the physical
   insights into the surface passivation effect and band alignment but also
   can open a promising route to design the thin passivation layer having
   the narrowing band gap energy (1.0 eV similar to 2.5 eV) on the 1D TiO2
   nanostructure for further enhanced performance and realization of a TiO2
   based PEC system. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Title = {{Myocardial T-1-mapping at 3T using saturation-recovery: reference
   values, precision and comparison with MOLLI}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Background: Myocardial T-1-mapping recently emerged as a promising
   quantitative method for non-invasive tissue characterization in numerous
   cardiomyopathies. Commonly performed with an inversion-recovery (IR)
   magnetization preparation at 1.5T, the application at 3T has gained due
   to increased quantification precision. Alternatively,
   saturation-recovery (SR) T-1-mapping has recently been introduced at
   1.5T for improved accuracy. Thus, the purpose of this study is to
   investigate the robustness and precision of SR T-1-mapping at 3T and to
   establish accurate reference values for native T-1-times and
   extracellular volume fraction (ECV) of healthy myocardium.
   Methods: Balanced Steady-State Free-Precession (bSSFP) Saturation-Pulse
   Prepared Heart-rate independent Inversion-REcovery (SAPPHIRE) and
   Saturation-recovery Single-SHot Acquisition (SASHA) T-1-mapping were
   compared with the Modified Look-Locker inversion recovery (MOLLI)
   sequence at 3T. Accuracy and precision were studied in phantom. Native
   and post-contrast T-1-times and regional ECV were determined in 20
   healthy subjects (10 men, 27 +/- 5 years). Subjective image quality,
   susceptibility artifact rating, in-vivo precision and reproducibility
   were analyzed.
   Results: SR T-1-mapping showed <4 \% deviation from the spin-echo
   reference in phantom in the range of T-1 = 100-2300 ms. The average
   quality and artifact scores of the T-1-mapping methods were: MOLLI:
   3.4/3.6, SAPPHIRE: 3.1/3.4, SASHA: 2.9/3.2; (1: poor - 4: excellent/1:
   strong - 4: none). SAPPHIRE and SASHA yielded significantly higher
   T-1-times (SAPPHIRE: 1578 +/- 42 ms, SASHA: 1523 +/- 46 ms), in-vivo
   T-1-time variation (SAPPHIRE: 60.1 +/- 8.7 ms, SASHA: 70.0 +/- 9.3 ms)
   and lower ECV-values (SAPPHIRE: 0.20 +/- 0.02, SASHA: 0.21 +/- 0.03)
   compared with MOLLI (T-1: 1181 +/- 47 ms, ECV: 0.26 +/- 0.03, Precision:
   53.7 +/- 8.1 ms). No significant difference was found in the
   inter-subject variability of T-1-times or ECV-values (T-1: p = 0.90,
   ECV: p = 0.78), the observer agreement (inter: p > 0.19; intra: p >
   0.09) or consistency (inter: p > 0.07; intra: p > 0.17) between the
   three methods.
   Conclusions: Saturation-recovery T-1-mapping at 3T yields higher
   accuracy, comparable inter-subject, inter- and intra-observer
   variability and less than 30 \% precision-loss compared to MOLLI.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Peptides have attracted considerable attention due to their
   biocompatibility, functional molecular recognition and unique biological
   and electronic properties. The strong piezoelectricity in
   diphenylalanine peptide expands its technological potential as a smart
   material. However, its random and unswitchable polarization has been the
   roadblock to fulfilling its potential and hence the demonstration of a
   piezoelectric device remains lacking. Here we show the control of
   polarization with an electric field applied during the peptide
   self-assembly process. Uniform polarization is obtained in two opposite
   directions with an effective piezoelectric constant d(33) reaching 17.9
   pm V-1. We demonstrate the power generation with a peptide-based power
   generator that produces an open-circuit voltage of 1.4V and a power
   density of 3.3nWcm(-2). Devices enabled by peptides with controlled
   piezoelectricity provide a renewable and biocompatible energy source for
   biomedical applications and open up a portal to the next generation of
   multi-functional electronics compatible with human tissue.}},

Title = {{Sponge-supported synthesis of colloidal selenium nanospheres}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{46}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{With increasing biomedical and engineering applications of selenium
   nanospheres (SeNS), new efficient methods are needed for the synthesis
   and long-term preservation of these nanomaterials. Currently, SeNS are
   mostly produced through the biosynthesis route using microorganisms or
   by using wet chemical reduction, both of which have several limitations
   in terms of nanoparticle size, yield, production time and long-term
   stability of the nanoparticles. Here, we introduce a novel approach for
   rapid synthesis and long-term preservation of SeNS on a solid
   microporous support by combining a mild hydrothermal process with
   chemical reduction. By using a natural sponge as a solid
   three-dimensional matrix for nanoparticle growth, we have synthesized
   highly monodisperse spherical nanoparticles with a wide size range
   (10-1000 nm) and extremely high yield in a relatively short period of
   time (1 h). Additionally, the synthesized SeNS can be stored and
   retrieved whenever needed by simply washing the sponge in water. Keeping
   the nanospheres in the support offers remarkable long-term stability as
   particles left on the sponge preserve their morphological and colloidal
   characteristics even after eight months of storage. Furthermore, this
   work reveals that SeNS can be used for efficient mercury capture from
   contaminated waters with a record-breaking mercury removal capacity of
   1900 mg g(-1).}},

Abstract = {{We report the bulk cationic ring-opening polymerization of renewably
   sourced 2-methyl-1,3-dioxan-4-one (MDO) to yield a polyester with
   hydrolytically and thermally sensitive linkages that facilitate
   degradation. Neat monomer was successfully polymerized using a variety
   of protic acids as catalysts. We discovered that, with these catalysts,
   the cationic polymerization of MDO proceeds via two distinct mechanistic
   routes, namely, the activated monomer (AM) and active chain-end (ACE)
   mechanisms. The kinetics of these competing mechanistic avenues were
   investigated by employing diphenylphosphoric acid (DPP) with or without
   an alcohol initiator. Without an exogenous initiator, the polymerization
   propagates via a dioxacarbenium ion that rapidly adds more MDO to
   produce high-molar-mass poly(2-methyl-1,3-dioxan-4-one) (PMDO). However,
   we found no clear relationship between {[}MDO](0)/{[}protic acid](0) and
   resultant molar mass, suggesting that the ACE mechanism is not well
   controlled. This conclusion was further supported by the production of
   cyclic PMDO arising from unimolecular backbiting reactions as the system
   approached equilibrium. With an exogenous alcohol initiator, the
   polymerization proceeds primarily via an AM mechanism and affords a
   mixture of linear PMDO and a small amount of macrocyclics derived from
   the competing ACE mechanism. Consistent with this interpretation of
   competing mechanisms, a linear relationship between theoretical and
   observed molar mass was observed when the initial ratio of monomer to
   added initiator was <80.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},

Abstract = {{Estimating extended brain sources using EEG/MEG source imaging
   techniques is challenging. EEG and MEG have excellent temporal
   resolution at millisecond scale but their spatial resolution is limited
   due to the volume conduction effect. We have exploited sparse signal
   processing techniques in this study to impose sparsity on the underlying
   source and its transformation in other domains (mathematical domains,
   like spatial gradient). Using an iterative reweighting strategy to
   penalize locations that are less likely to contain any source, it is
   shown that the proposed iteratively reweighted edge sparsity
   minimization (IRES) strategy can provide reasonable information
   regarding the location and extent of the underlying sources. This
   approach is unique in the sense that it estimates extended sources
   without the need of subjectively thresholding the solution. The
   performance of IRES was evaluated in a series of computer simulations.
   Different parameters such as source location and signal-to-noise ratio
   were varied and the estimated results were compared to the targets using
   metrics such as localization error (LE), area under curve (AUC) and
   overlap between the estimated and simulated sources. It is shown that
   IRES provides extended solutions which not only localize the source but
   also provide estimation for the source extent. The performance of IRES
   was further tested in epileptic patients undergoing intracranial EEG
   (iEEG) recording for pre-surgical evaluation. IRES was applied to scalp
   EEGs during interictal spikes, and results were compared with iEEG and
   surgical resection outcome in the patients. The pilot clinical study
   results are promising and demonstrate a good concordance between
   noninvasive IRES source estimation with iEEG and surgical resection
   outcomes in the same patients. The proposed algorithm, i.e. IRES,
   estimates extended source solutions from scalp electromagnetic signals
   which provide relatively accurate information about the location and
   extent of the underlying source. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{We discuss the development and implementation of a comprehensive
   mathematical model for the traveling heater method (THM) that is
   formulated to realistically represent the interactions of heat and
   species transport, fluid flow, and interfacial dissolution and growth
   under conditions of local thermodynamic equilibrium and steady-state
   growth. We examine the complicated interactions among zone geometry,
   continuum transport, phase change, and fluid flow driven by buoyancy. Of
   particular interest and importance is the formation of flow structures
   in the liquid zone of the THM that arise from the same physical
   mechanism as lee waves in atmospheric flows and demonstrate the same
   characteristic Brunt Vaisala scaling. We show that flow stagnation and
   reversal associated with lee-wave formation are responsible for the
   accumulation of tellurium and supercooled liquid near the growth
   interface, even when the lee-wave vortex is not readily apparent in the
   overall flow structure. The supercooled fluid is posited to result in
   morphological instability at growth rates far below the limit predicted
   by the classical criterion by Tiller et al. for constitutional
   supercooling. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Unstructured Cartesian refinement with sharp interface immersed boundary
   method for 3D unsteady incompressible flows}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{325}},
Pages = {{272-300}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{A novel numerical method is developed for solving the 3D, unsteady,
   incompressible Navier-Stokes equations on locally refined fully
   unstructured Cartesian grids in domains with arbitrarily complex
   immersed boundaries. Owing to the utilization of the fractional step
   method on an unstructured Cartesian hybrid staggered/non-staggered grid
   layout, flux mismatch and pressure discontinuity issues are avoided and
   the divergence free constraint is inherently satisfied to machine zero.
   Auxiliary/hanging nodes are used to facilitate the discretization of the
   governing equations. The second-order accuracy of the solver is ensured
   by using multi-dimension Lagrange interpolation operators and
   appropriate differencing schemes at the interface of regions with
   different levels of refinement. The sharp interface immersed boundary
   method is augmented with local near-boundary refinement to handle
   arbitrarily complex boundaries. The discrete momentum equation is solved
   with the matrix free Newton-Krylov method and the Krylov-subspace method
   is employed to solve the Poisson equation. The second-order accuracy of
   the proposed method on unstructured Cartesian grids is demonstrated by
   solving the Poisson equation with a known analytical solution. A number
   of three-dimensional laminar flow simulations of increasing complexity
   illustrate the ability of the method to handle flows across a range of
   Reynolds numbers and flow regimes. Laminar steady and unsteady flows
   past a sphere and the oblique vortex shedding from a circular cylinder
   mounted between two end walls demonstrate the accuracy, the efficiency
   and the smooth transition of scales and coherent structures across
   refinement levels. Large-eddy simulation (LES) past a miniature wind
   turbine rotor, parameterized using the actuator line approach, indicates
   the ability of the fully unstructured solver to simulate complex
   turbulent flows. Finally, a geometry resolving LES of turbulent flow
   past a complete hydrokinetic turbine illustrates the potential of the
   method to simulate turbulent flows past geometrically complex bodies on
   locally refined meshes. In all the cases, the results are found to be in
   very good agreement with published data and savings in computational
   resources are achieved. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{85}},
Pages = {{280-286}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Here we report a disposable, cost effective electrochemical paper-based
   sensor for the detection of both nitrate and mercury ions in lake water
   and contaminated agricultural runoff. Disposable carbon paper electrodes
   were functionalized with selenium particles (SePs) and gold
   nanoparticles (AuNPs). The AuNPs served as a catalyst for the reduction
   of nitrate ions using differential pulse voltammetry techniques. The
   AuNPs also served as a nucleation sites for mercury ions. The SePs
   further reinforced this mercury ion nucleation due to their high binding
   affinity to mercury. Differential pulse stripping voltammetry techniques
   were used to further enhance mercury ion accumulation on the modified
   electrode. The fabricated electrode was characterized by scanning
   electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, and
   electrochemistry techniques. The obtained results show that the
   PEG-SH/SePs/AuNPs modified carbon paper electrode has a dual
   functionality in that it can detect both nitrate and mercury ions
   without any interference. The modified carbon paper electrode has
   improved the analytical sensitivity of nitrate and mercury ions with
   limits of detection of 8.6 mu M and 1.0 ppb, respectively. Finally, the
   modified electrode was used to measure nitrate and mercury in lake water
   samples. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   proposed Markov Chain solution method successfully converts the complex
   multiple scattering problem with practical phase functions into a matrix
   form and solves transmitted/reflected photon angular distributions by
   matrix multiplications. Such characteristics would potentially allow
   practical inversions by matrix manipulation or stochastic algorithms
   where widely applied stochastic methods such as Monte Carlo simulations
   usually fail, and thus enable practical diagnostics reconstructions such
   as medical diagnosis, spray analysis, and atmosphere sciences. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We use magnetic field and plasma observations from the Van Allen Probes,
   Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (
   THEMIS) and Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite system (
   GOES) spacecraft to study the spatial and temporal characteristics of
   long-lasting poloidal Pc4 pulsations in the dayside magnetosphere. The
   pulsations were observed after the main phase of a moderate storm during
   low geomagnetic activity. The pulsations occurred during various
   interplanetary conditions and the solar wind parameters do not seem to
   control the occurrence of the pulsations. The most striking feature of
   the Pc4 magnetic field pulsations was their occurrence at similar
   locations during three of four successive orbits. We used this
   information to study the latitudinal nodal structure of the pulsations
   and demonstrated that the latitudinal extent of the magnetic field
   pulsations did not exceed 2 Earth radii (R-E\}. A phase shift between
   the azimuthal and radial components of the electric and magnetic fields
   was observed from Z(SM) = 0.30 R-E to Z(SM) = 0.16 R-E. We used magnetic
   and electric field data from Van Allen Probes to determine the structure
   of ULF waves. We showed that the Pc4 magnetic field pulsations were
   radially polarized and are the secondmode harmonic waves. We suggest
   that the spacecraft were near a magnetic field null during the second
   orbit when they failed to observe the magnetic field pulsations at the
   local times where pulsations were observed on previous and successive
   orbits. We investigated the spectral structure of the Pc4 pulsations.
   Each spacecraft observed a decrease of the dominant period as it moved
   to a smaller L shell (stronger magnetic field strength). We demonstrated
   that higher frequencies occurred at times and locations where Alfven
   velocities were greater, i.e., on Orbit 1. There is some evidence that
   the periods of the pulsations increased during the plasmasphere
   refilling following the storm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the robustness of a feedback connection of a known
   linear parameter varying system and a perturbation. A sufficient
   condition is derived to bound the worst-case gain and ensure robust
   asymptotic stability. The input/output behavior of the perturbation is
   described by multiple integral quadratic constraints (IQCs). The
   analysis condition is formulated as a dissipation inequality. The
   standard approach requires a non-negative definite storage function and
   the use of hard' IQCs. The term hard' means that the IQCs can be
   specified as time-domain integral constraints that hold over all finite
   horizons. The main result demonstrates that the dissipation inequality
   condition can be formulated requiring neither a non-negative storage
   function nor hard IQCs. A key insight used to prove this result is that
   the multiple IQCs, when combined, contain hidden stored energy. This
   result can lead to less conservative robustness bounds. Two simple
   examples are presented to demonstrate this fact. Copyright (c) 2016 John

Abstract = {{Co-option of host components by solid tumors facilitates cancer
   progression and can occur in both local tumor microenvironments and
   remote locations. At present, the signals involved in long-distance
   communication remain insufficiently understood. Here, we identify
   platelet factor 4 (PF4, CXCL4) as an endocrine factor whose
   overexpression in tumors correlates with decreased overall patient
   survival. Furthermore, engineered PF4 over-production in a Kras-driven
   lung adenocarcinoma genetic mouse model expanded megakaryopoiesis in
   bone marrow, augmented platelet accumulation in lungs, and accelerated
   de novo adenocarcinogenesis. Additionally, anti-platelet treatment
   controlled mouse lung cancer progression, further suggesting that
   platelets can modulate the tumor microenvironment to accelerate tumor
   outgrowth. These findings support PF4 as a cancer-enhancing endocrine
   signal that controls discrete aspects of bone marrow hematopoiesis and
   tumor microenvironment and that should be considered as a molecular
   target in anticancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Due to the unsustainable consumption of fossil resources,
   great efforts have been made to convert lignocellulose into bioethanol
   and commodity organic compounds through biological methods. The
   conversion of cellulose is impeded by the compactness of plant cell wall
   matrix and crystalline structure of the native cellulose. Therefore,
   appropriate pretreatment and even post-treatment are indispensable to
   overcome this problem. Additionally, an adequate utilization of
   coproduct lignin will be important for improving the economic viability
   of modern biorefinery industries.
   Results: The effectiveness of moderate alkaline ethanol post-treatment
   on the bioconversion efficiency of cellulose in the acid-steam-exploded
   corn stover was investigated in this study. Results showed that an
   increase of the alcoholic sodium hydroxide (NaOH) concentration from
   0.05 to 4\% led to a decrease in the lignin content in the posttreated
   samples from 32.8 to 10.7\%, while the cellulose digestibility
   consequently increased. The cellulose conversion of the 4\% alcoholic
   NaOH integrally treated corn stover reached up to 99.3\% after 72 h,
   which was significantly higher than that of the acid steam exploded corn
   stover without post-treatment (57.3\%). In addition to the decrease in
   lignin content, an expansion of cellulose I lattice induced by the 4\%
   alcoholic NaOH post-treatment played a significant role in promoting the
   enzymatic hydrolysis of corn stover. More importantly, the lignin
   fraction (AL) released during the 4\% alcoholic NaOH post-treatment and
   the lignin-rich residue (EHR) remained after the enzymatic hydrolysis of
   the 4\% alcoholic NaOH post-treated acid-steam-exploded corn stover were
   employed to synthesize lignin-phenol-formaldehyde (LPF) resins. The
   plywoods prepared with the resins exhibit satisfactory performances.
   Conclusions: An alkaline ethanol system with an appropriate NaOH
   concentration could improve the removal of lignin and modification of
   the crystalline structure of cellulose in acid-steam-exploded corn
   stover, and consequently significantly improve the conversion of
   cellulose through enzymatic hydrolysis for biofuel production. The
   lignin fractions obtained as byproducts could be applied in high
   performance LPF resin preparation. The proposed model for the integral
   valorization of corn stover in this study is worth of popularization.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchical materials with porous structures at different length scales
   (i.e., micropore and mesopore) are an emerging class of materials.
   However, the lack of fundamental understanding of mass transport
   properties significantly limits rational development of these materials
   for applications in catalysis and separation. In this study, we
   evaluated the mass transport of two probe molecules, cyclohexane and
   1-methylnaphthalene, in two different types of hierarchical porous
   materials, SBA-15 mesoporous silica and three dimensionally ordered
   mesoporous imprinted (3DOm-i) silicalite-1 zeolite, for comparison with
   nonmicroporous MCM-41 mesoporous silica. It was observed that the
   apparent diffusion lengths determined for hierarchical porous materials
   (i.e., SBA-15 and 3DOm-i silicalite-1) were significantly longer than
   predicted by the physical structure (i.e., radius) of the adsorbent
   particle, indicating that diffusion of molecules in hierarchical porous
   materials is much longer than expected. The unusually long path length
   is likely due to diffusion on the external surface, followed by
   re-entering of diffusing molecules from the external surface into the
   micropores; the large external surface area of hierarchical porous
   materials enhances the extent of this phenomenon. The observations
   reported in the study highlight the importance of surface diffusion in
   hierarchical porous materials. Enhanced mass transport in hierarchical
   porous materials can be overpredicted without considering the extent of
   sorbate sorbent interaction and the actual diffusion length.}},

Title = {{A Unified View of the Substitution-Dependent Antiferrodistortive Phase
   Transition in SrTiO3}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{7973-7981}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The cubic-to-tetragonal antiferrodistortive transition at 105 K in the
   most widely studied perovskite, SrTiO3, is perhaps the preeminent
   example of a second-order structural phase transition. Extensive
   investigations since the 1960s have tracked the softening of the phonon
   mode associated with this transition, the development of octahedral
   rotations, and the interplay with incipient ferroelectricity and
   superconductivity. It is less well known that modest ionic substitutions
   alter the transition temperature (T-a) over a remarkable range in
   SrTiO3, from 0 K to above ambient. Here, we first study the
   thermodynamics of the transition via specific heat and determine a T-a
   shift of +10.9 K/atomic \% in Nb-substituted crystals, the most heavily
   studied in terms of electronic transport. We then present the first
   quantitative rationalization of the trends in T-a with substitution in
   SrTiO3. We demonstrate that the apparently complex behavior versus
   tolerance factor occurs simply due to a nonlinear dependence of the rate
   of change of T-a with substituent concentration. We then connect this to
   ionic valence mismatch, using bond valence concepts to establish a new
   parameter, <epsilon(4)>, which exhibits a universal linear dependence
   with T-a for all known substitutions. This provides the first unified
   view of the substituent-dependent T-a in SrTiO3, deepens our
   understanding of the phase transition (including a theoretical maximum
   in the rate of T-a suppression), and demonstrates predictive power via a
   simply computed parameter.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the thin film self-assembly and post fabrication
   functionalization of cylinder-forming
   poly(styrene-block-2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) (PS-b-PVDMA) block
   copolymers (BCPs). Thermal annealing of an asymmetric BCP composition,
   to drive microphase separation in thin films, results in high defect
   densities and poor long-range order. Using FTIR spectroscopy and
   ellipsometry, we demonstrate that thermal annealing results in reactions
   between the azlactone groups and the underlying substrate leading to BCP
   ``pinning{''}. We demonstrate that solvent annealing circumvents these
   issues and drives high fidelity microphase separation of the BCP in thin
   films. The solvent annealing approach also enables control over domain
   orientation; we show that parallel and perpendicularly oriented
   cylinders with diameters of 11.7 +/- 1.2 nm and a center to-center
   distance of 25.2 +/- 2.6 nm can be obtained using a BCP with M-n = 29.5
   kDa and f(s) = 0.75. The PVDMA segments in these self-assembled thin
   films remain available for reaction with primary amine-functionalized
   nucleophiles. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth-profiling
   reveals that reactions between azlactone groups and incoming amines
   occur primarily in the top few nanometers of the reactive domains.
   Finally, we demonstrate that the azlactone groups in both parallel and
   perpendicularly oriented cylindrical thin films can selectively
   incorporate trimethylaluminum vapor, which can be subsequently converted
   into Al2O3 nanowires and nanodots with dimensions of 16 and 12 nm,
   respectively.}},

Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{The properties of polymer nanocomposites depend strongly on how well
   nanoparticles are dispersed. However, the hydrophobic nature and low
   polarity of PE have made effective dispersion of nano-filler difficult
   without compatibilization. We have found improved dispersion of
   chemically functionalized graphene oxide (FGO) in PE. The hydroxyl and
   epoxide groups on graphene oxide (GO) are sites for grafting on
   functional groups like alkanes. We covalently attach alkyl chains and
   benzyl moieties to GO. This FGO was solvent blended into three types of
   polyethylene: high density, linear low density, and oxidized PE
   matrices. Visual observation of cast films and optical micrographs
   revealed that FGO was more homogeneously dispersed than unmodified GO.
   Simple thermal reduction of the FGO sheets dispersed in PE at 210
   degrees C achieved a 10(6)-fold reduction in electrical resistance, much
   greater than that of other unmodified graphene composites. Moreover the
   tensile modulus of the low density PE was improved 12-fold and that of
   the high density PE 3-fold with 5\% FGO. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Two solution reactors in series are utilized to synthesize
   poly(ethylene-cb-propylene) comb block copolymers, P(E-cb-P), where the
   first reactor prepares vinyl terminated atactic polypropylene (aPP)
   macromers from propylene using an organometallic catalyst favoring beta
   methyl elimination and the second reactor copolymerizes aPP macromers
   with ethylene using a different organometallic catalyst capable of
   incorporating macromers. The products are P(E-cb-P) comb block polymers
   with bimodalities in molecular weight, composition, and long chain
   branching. Low molecular weight (MW) components are linear and of mixed
   compositions consisting of random copolymers of ethylene and propylene
   and residual vinyl terminated aPP macromers. High MW components are comb
   branched with constant composition, and block copolymers. Even though
   the PE backbone is immiscible with the aPP comb arms, the presence of
   linear low MW ethylene-propylene random copolymer prevents the high MW
   comb block components from self-association into segregated domains or
   micelles when it is blended into high density polyethylene (HDPE) or
   isotactic polypropylene (iPP). By hindering micelle formation, this
   bimodal P(E-cb-P) can be intimately entangled with HDPE and with iPP
   delivering extensional flow hardening when it was added at 5\%.
   Extensional strain hardening is observed at 5\% addition of the bimodal
   P(E-cb-P) comb block copolymer in 50/50 HDPE/iPP blends with
   exceptionally high strain hardening ratio. It was found that this
   bimodal P(E-cb-P) comb block copolymer can compatibilize immiscible
   blends of HDPE and iPP resulting in domain size reductions and diffused
   interfaces. The enhanced strain hardening observed in blends with the
   bimodal P(E-cb-P) comb block addition may arise from the increases in
   the blend interfacial area and the entanglement of the blocks within the
   homopolymer phases. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Reversible control over the electrical properties of the two-dimensional
   electron gas (2DEG) in oxide heterostructures is a key capability
   enabling practical applications. Herein, we report an efficient method
   to reversibly tune the charge carrier density of the 2DEG by surface
   modification. We demonstrate both increasing and decreasing the carrier
   density of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 2DEG interface via application of
   functional phosphonic acids with molecular dipoles pointing either
   toward or away from the interface, respectively. In addition, in the
   case of the enhanced 2DEG, we recovered the initial conduction
   properties by exposing the samples to a basic solution. The tuning
   processes were highly reversible over repetitive cycles. These results
   reveal that the surface modification is an efficient way to tune the
   carrier density of 2DEG in oxide heterostructures. This simple chemical
   approach offers a vast range of fabrication possibilities in versatile
   electronic device applications. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Co-expression network analysis of duplicate genes in maize (Zea mays L.)
   reveals no subgenome bias}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Gene duplication is prevalent in many species and can result
   in coding and regulatory divergence. Gene duplications can be classified
   as whole genome duplication (WGD), tandem and inserted (non-syntenic).
   In maize, WGD resulted in the subgenomes maize1 and maize2, of which
   maize1 is considered the dominant subgenome. However, the landscape of
   co-expression network divergence of duplicate genes in maize is still
   largely uncharacterized.
   Results: To address the consequence of gene duplication on co-expression
   network divergence, we developed a gene co-expression network from
   RNA-seq data derived from 64 different tissues/stages of the maize
   reference inbred-B73. WGD, tandem and inserted gene duplications
   exhibited distinct regulatory divergence. Inserted duplicate genes were
   more likely to be singletons in the co-expression networks, while WGD
   duplicate genes were likely to be co-expressed with other genes. Tandem
   duplicate genes were enriched in the co-expression pattern where
   co-expressed genes were nearly identical for the duplicates in the
   network. Older gene duplications exhibit more extensive co-expression
   variation than younger duplications. Overall, non-syntenic genes
   primarily from inserted duplications show more co-expression divergence.
   Also, such enlarged co-expression divergence is significantly related to
   duplication age. Moreover, subgenome dominance was not observed in the
   co-expression networks - maize1 and maize2 exhibit similar levels of
   intra subgenome correlations. Intriguingly, the level of inter subgenome
   co-expression was similar to the level of intra subgenome correlations,
   and genes from specific subgenomes were not likely to be the enriched in
   co-expression network modules and the hub genes were not predominantly
   from any specific subgenomes in maize.
   Conclusions: Our work provides a comprehensive analysis of maize
   co-expression network divergence for three different types of gene
   duplications and identifies potential relationships between duplication
   types, duplication ages and co-expression consequences.}},

Abstract = {{Ultrafast optical heating of the electrons in ferrimagnetic metals can
   result in all-optical switching (AOS) of the magnetization. Here we
   report quantitative measurements of the temperature rise of GdFeCo thin
   films during helicity-independent AOS. Critical switching fluences are
   obtained as a function of the initial temperature of the sample and for
   laser pulse durations from 55 fs to 15 ps. We conclude that
   nonequilibrium phenomena are necessary for helicity-independent AOS,
   although the peak electron temperature does not play a critical role.
   Pump-probe time-resolved experiments show that the switching time
   increases as the pulse duration increases, with 10 ps pulses resulting
   in switching times of similar to 13 ps. These results raise new
   questions about the fundamental mechanism of helicity-independent AOS.}},

Abstract = {{Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can display de novo or acquired resistance
   to cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C), a primary component of induction
   chemotherapy. To identify genes capable of independently imposing Ara-C
   resistance, we applied a genome-wide CRISPR library to human U937 cells
   and exposed to them to Ara-C. Interestingly, all drug resistant clones
   contained guide RNAs for DCK. To avoid DCK gene modification, gRNA
   resistant DCK cDNA was created by the introduction of silent mutations.
   The CRISPR screening was repeated using the gRNA resistant DCK, and loss
   of SLC29A was identified as also being capable of conveying Ara-C drug
   resistance. To determine if loss of Dck results in increased sensitivity
   to other drugs, we conducted a screen of 446 FDA approved drugs using
   two Dck-defective BXH-2 derived murine AML cell lines and their Ara-C
   sensitive parental lines. Both cell lines showed an increase in
   sensitivity to prednisolone. Guide RNA resistant cDNA rescue was a
   legitimate strategy and multiple DCK or SLC29A deficient human cell
   clones were established with one clone becoming prednisolone sensitive.
   Dck-defective leukemic cells may become prednisolone sensitive
   indicating prednisolone may be an effective adjuvant therapy in some
   cases of DCK-negative AML.}},

Abstract = {{We explore the possibility of re-engineering mitochondrial genes and
   expressing them from the nucleus as an approach to rescue defects
   arising from mitochondrial DNA mutations. We have used a patient cybrid
   cell line with a single point mutation in the overlap region of the ATP8
   and ATP6 genes of the human mitochondrial genome. These cells are null
   for the ATP8 protein, have significantly lowered ATP6 protein levels and
   no Complex V function. Nuclear expression of only the ATP8 gene with the
   ATP5G1 mitochondrial targeting sequence appended restored viability on
   Krebs cycle substrates and ATP synthesis capabilities but, failed to
   restore ATP hydrolysis and was insensitive to various inhibitors of
   oxidative phosphorylation. Co-expressing both ATP8 and ATP6 genes under
   similar conditions resulted in stable protein expression leading to
   successful integration into Complex V of the oxidative phosphorylation
   machinery. Tests for ATP hydrolysis / synthesis, oxygen consumption,
   glycolytic metabolism and viability all indicate a significant
   functional rescue of the mutant phenotype (including re-assembly of
   Complex V) following stable co-expression of ATP8 and ATP6. Thus, we
   report the stable allotopic expression, import and function of two
   mitochondria encoded genes, ATP8 and ATP6, resulting in simultaneous
   rescue of the loss of both mitochondrial proteins.}},

Abstract = {{A compressed air energy storage system that uses a high pressure,
   isothermal air compressor/expander (C/E) has no carbon emission and is
   more efficient than a conventional system that uses fossil fuels. To be
   successful, the compressor/expander must be efficient and has high power
   density. However, there is a trade-off between efficiency and power
   density due to heat transfer. The authors' previous work has shown that
   by optimising the compression/expansion trajectories in a liquid piston
   C/E, the power density can be improved by many times without sacrificing
   efficiency. Yet, to achieve the optimised trajectory, this requires a
   large liquid piston pump/motor that often operates at low displacement,
   low efficiency regime. This study proposes that by combining the liquid
   piston with a solid piston actuated via a hydraulic intensifier, the
   pump/motor size can be reduced significantly. A case study shows that
   with an optimal intensifier ratio, the pump/motor size is reduced by
   85\%, the ratio between maximum and minimum displacements is reduced by
   7 times, and the mean efficiency is increased by 2.4 times. A full cycle
   dynamic simulation shows that the intensifier decreases, for the same
   pump/motor size, the total cycle time for over 50\%, thus doubling the
   power density of the compressor/expander.}},

Abstract = {{The aqueous self-assembly of mu-A(BC)(n) miktobrush terpolymers has been
   studied using dynamic light scattering and cryogenic transmission
   electron microscopy. In this system, the A block is hydrophilic
   poly(ethylene oxide), ``O{''}, the B block is hydrophobic
   poly(methylcaprolactone), ``C{''}, and the C block is hydrophobic and
   oleophobic poly(perfluoropropylene oxide), ``F{''}. Two terpolymers were
   examined: one with an average of about two C blocks and two F blocks and
   another with an average of about three C blocks and two F blocks. In
   both cases, the total molar mass is near 40 kg mol(-1), and the volume
   fraction of the single O block is greater than 50\% of the whole. Both
   samples form multicompartment micelle structures with subdivided
   solvophobic cores of C and F domains. The morphologies observed are
   generally analogous to those previously observed for the self-assembly
   of mu-ABC miktoarm star terpolymers, namely, ``raspberry{''} and
   ``hamburger{''} micelles; however, an intriguing multicompartment
   polymersome morphology with compartmentalized solvophobic bilayers is
   also observed. These results are interpreted in terms of the relative
   strengths of the competing interactions among the three blocks and the
   solvent and in terms of the constraints imposed by the miktobrush
   architecture.}},

Abstract = {{Contemporary electricity distribution systems are being challenged by
   the variability of renewable energy sources. Slow response times and
   long energy management periods cannot efficiently integrate intermittent
   renewable generation and demand. Yet stochasticity can be judiciously
   coupled with system flexibilities to enhance grid operation efficiency.
   Voltage magnitudes for instance can transiently exceed regulation
   limits, while smart inverters can be overloaded over short time
   intervals. To implement such a mode of operation, an ergodic energy
   management framework is developed here. Considering a distribution grid
   with distributed energy sources and a feed-in tariff program, active
   power curtailment and reactive power compensation are formulated as a
   stochastic optimization problem. Tighter operational constraints are
   enforced in an average sense, while looser margins are enforced to be
   satisfied at all times. Stochastic dual subgradient solvers are
   developed based on exact and approximate grid models of varying
   complexity. Numerical tests on a real-world 56-bus distribution grid and
   the IEEE 123-bus test feeder relying on both grid models corroborate the
   advantages of the novel schemes over their deterministic alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Intracellular transport is an essential function in eucaryotic cells,
   facilitated by motor proteins-proteins converting chemical energy into
   kinetic energy. It is understood that motor proteins work in teams
   enabling unidirectional and bidirectional transport of intracellular
   cargo over long distances. Disruptions of the underlying transport
   mechanisms, often caused by mutations that alter single motor
   characteristics, are known to cause neurodegenerative diseases. For
   example, phosphorylation of kinesin motor domain at the serine residue
   is implicated in Huntington's disease, with a recent study of
   phosphorylated and phosphomimetic serine residues indicating lowered
   single motor stalling forces. In this article we report the effects of
   mutations of this nature on transport properties of cargo carried by
   multiple wild-type and mutant motors. Results indicate that mutants with
   altered stall forces might determine the average velocity and run-length
   even when they are outnumbered by wild type motors in the ensemble. It
   is shown that mutants gain a competitive advantage and lead to an
   increase in the expected run-length when the load on the cargo is in the
   vicinity of the mutant's stalling force or a multiple of its stalling
   force. A separate contribution of this article is the development of a
   semi-analytic method to analyze transport of cargo by multiple motors of
   multiple types. The technique determines transition rates between
   various relative configurations of motors carrying the cargo using the
   transition rates between various absolute configurations. This enables a
   computation of biologically relevant quantities like average velocity
   and run-length without resorting to Monte Carlo simulations. It can also
   be used to introduce alterations of various single motor parameters to
   model a mutation and to deduce effects of such alterations on the
   transport of a common cargo by multiple motors. Our method is easily
   implementable and we provide a software package for general use.}},

Abstract = {{Pyrolysis of waste tire with HY, HZSM-5 (HZ) and purified attapulgite
   (PA) catalysts to produce valuable aromatic hydrocarbons has been
   carried out in a Pyrolyzer- Gas Chromatograph/Mass Spectrum (Py-GC/MS)
   reactor. Likewise, D-limonene and polybutadiene rubber (BR), which
   played important roles in the pyrolysis process of waste tire, has also
   been pyrolyzed in the Py-GC/MS reactor with these catalysts. Based on
   the product distribution, the catalytic pyrolysis mechanisms of
   D-limonene were proposed, while those of BR were extended. With these
   mechanisms, the catalytic pyrolysis characteristics of waste tire could
   be explained reasonably. Results showed that HY promoted a dramatic
   increase of aromatics from pyrolysis of D-limonene and BR, leading to
   the considerable growth of aromatics in the degraded products of waste
   tire. The shape selectivity of HZ to mono-cyclic aromatics performed
   effectively in the pyrolysis of BR, yet it exhibited a weak performance
   in the pyrolysis of D-limonene. As a result, upon the catalytic
   pyrolysis of waste tire, HZ was inferior to HY in the aromatization
   ability. However, the selectivity of HZ to BTXE (benzene, toluene,
   xylene and ethylbenzene) was superior to that of HY. PA performed a
   weaker catalytic ability in promoting the production of aromatics during
   the pyrolysis of D-limonene, BR and waste tire. (C) 2016 Published by

   pH-Responsive Star Polymer that Forms Unimolecular Micelles in Water}},
Journal = {{POLYMERS}},

Abstract = {{Dual functional unimolecular micelles based on a pH-responsive
   amphiphilic star polymer -CD-(PLA-b-PDMAEMA-b-PEtOxMA)(21) have been
   developed for the co-delivery of imiquimod and plasmid DNA to dendritic
   cells. The star polymer with well-defined triblock arms was synthesized
   by combining activator regenerated by electron-transfer atom-transfer
   radical polymerization with ring-opening polymerization. Dissipative
   particle dynamics simulation showed that core-mesophere-shell-type
   unimolecular micelles could be formed. Imiquimod-loaded micelles had a
   drug loading of 1.6 wt \% and a larger average size (28 nm) than blank
   micelles (19 nm). The release of imiquimod in vitro was accelerated at
   the mildly acidic endolysosomal pH (5.0) in comparison to physiologic pH
   (7.4). Compared with blank micelles, a higher N:P ratio was required for
   imiquimod-loaded micelles to fully condense DNA into micelleplexes
   averaging 200-400 nm in size. In comparison to blank micelleplexes,
   imiquimod-loaded micelleplexes of the same N:P ratio displayed similar
   or slightly higher efficiency of gene transfection in a mouse dendritic
   cell line (DC2.4) without cytotoxicity. These results suggest that such
   pH-responsive unimolecular micelles formed by the well-defined
   amphiphilic star polymer may serve as promising nano-scale carriers for
   combined delivery of hydrophobic immunostimulatory drugs (such as
   imiquimod) and plasmid DNA with potential application in gene-based
   immunotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel classification-based optic disc (OD)
   segmentation algorithm that detects the OD boundary and the location of
   vessel origin (VO) pixel. First, the green plane of each fundus image is
   resized and morphologically reconstructed using a circular structuring
   element. Bright regions are then extracted from the morphologically
   reconstructed image that lie in close vicinity of the major blood
   vessels. Next, the bright regions are classified as bright probable OD
   regions and non-OD regions using six region-based features and a
   Gaussian mixture model classifier. The classified bright probable OD
   region with maximum Vessel-Sum and Solidity is detected as the best
   candidate region for the OD. Other bright probable OD regions within
   1-disc diameter from the centroid of the best candidate OD region are
   then detected as remaining candidate regions for the OD. A convex hull
   containing all the candidate OD regions is then estimated, and a
   best-fit ellipse across the convex hull becomes the segmented OD
   boundary. Finally, the centroid of major blood vessels within the
   segmented OD boundary is detected as the VO pixel location. The proposed
   algorithm has low computation time complexity and it is robust to
   variations in image illumination, imaging angles, and retinal
   abnormalities. This algorithm achieves 98.8\%-100\% OD segmentation
   success and OD segmentation overlap score in the range of 72\%-84\% on
   images from the six public datasets of DRIVE, DIARETDB1, DIARETDB0,
   CHASE\_DB1, MESSIDOR, and STARE in less than 2.14 s per image. Thus, the
   proposed algorithm can be used for automated detection of retinal
   pathologies, such as glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and maculopathy.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note develops linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions
   to test whether an uncertain linear system is exponentially stable with
   a given decay rate a. These new a-exponential stability tests are
   derived for an uncertain system described by an interconnection of a
   nominal linear time-invariant system and a ``troublesome{''}
   perturbation. The perturbation can contain uncertain parameters, time
   delays, or nonlinearities. This technical note presents two key
   contributions. First, a-exponential stability of the uncertain LTI
   system is shown to be equivalent to (internal) linear stability of a
   related scaled system. This enables derivation of a-exponential
   stability tests from linear stability tests using integral quadratic
   constraints (IQCs). This connection requires IQCs to be constructed for
   a scaled perturbation operator. The second contribution is a list of
   IQCs derived for the scaled perturbation using the detailed structure of
   the original perturbation. Finally, connections between the proposed
   approach and related work are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated spectral power of neural oscillations associated
   with word processing in schizophrenia. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) data
   were acquired from 12 schizophrenia patients and 10 healthy controls
   during a visual word processing task. Two spectral power ratio (SPR)
   feature sets: the band power ratio (BPR) and the window power ratio
   (WPR) were extracted from MEG data in five frequency bands, four time
   windows of word processing, and at locations covering whole head.
   Cluster-based nonparametric permutation tests were employed to identify
   SPRs that show significant between-group difference. Machine learning
   based feature selection and classification techniques were then employed
   to select optimal combinations of the significant SPR features, and
   distinguish schizophrenia patients from healthy controls. We identified
   three BPR clusters and three WPR clusters that show significant
   oscillation power difference between groups. These include the
   theta/delta, alpha/delta and beta/delta BPRs during base-to-encode and
   encode time windows, and the beta band WPR from base to encode and from
   encode to post-encode windows. Based on two WPR and one BPR features
   combined, over 95\% cross-validation classification accuracy was
   achieved using three different linear classifiers separately. These
   features may have potential as quantitative markers that discriminate
   schizophrenia patients and healthy controls; however, this needs further
   validation on larger samples.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This article presents a Light Intensity-based Positioning System (LIPS)
   for indoor environments. The system uses off-the-shelf light-emitting
   diode lamps as signal sources and light sensors as signal receivers. The
   design is inspired by the observation that a light sensor has
   deterministic sensitivity to both the distance and incident angle of a
   light signal, an under-utilized feature of photodiodes now widely found
   on mobile devices. We develop a stable and accurate light intensity
   model to capture the phenomenon, based on which a new positioning
   principle, Multi-Face Light Positioning, is established that uses three
   collocated sensors to uniquely determine the receiver's position,
   assuming merely a single source of light. We have implemented a
   prototype on both dedicated embedded systems and smartphones.
   Experimental results show average positioning accuracy within 0.4m
   across different environments, with high stability against interferences
   from obstacles, ambient lights, temperature variation, and so on.}},

   multiple-access ( TDMA)-based protocols are proposed. However, packet
   collisions can still occur due to contention or multiple vehicles using
   the same slot while approaching each other, i.e., encounter collisions,
   particularly in two-way traffic roads. Some proposed remedying the
   encounter collisions for two-way traffic by partitioning a frame into
   two sets: one for the traffic in each direction. However, these proposed
   protocols are harder to adapt to the uneven traffic loads on both
   directions and cannot solve the problem of four-way intersections. In
   this paper, we propose a new TDMA protocol called prediction-based TDMA
   MAC ( PTMAC) based on a novel way of predicting encounter collisions and
   effectively reducing the number of collisions. To the best of our
   knowledge, PTMAC is the first protocol that is designed for both two-way
   traffic and four-way intersections. It has shown that, based on this
   predictability, the encounter collisions can be greatly reduced in both
   two-way traffic and four-way intersections, regardless of the traffic
   loads on different road segments.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To introduce a method of designing two-dimensional (2D)
   frequency-modulated pulses that produce phase coherence in a
   spatiotemporal manner. Uniquely, this class of pulses provides the
   ability to compensate for field inhomogeneity using a spatiotemporally
   dependent trajectory of maximum coherence in a single-shot.
   Theory and Methods: A pulse design method based on a k-space description
   is developed. Bloch simulations and phantom experiments are used to
   demonstrate sequential spatiotemporal phase coherence and compensation
   for B-1(+) and B-0 inhomogeneity.
   Results: In the presence of modulated gradients, the 2D
   frequency-modulated pulses were shown to excite a cylinder in a
   selective manner. With a surface coil transmitter, compensation of the
   effect of B-1(+) inhomogeneity was experimentally verified, in agreement
   with simulation results. In addition, simulations were used to
   demonstrate partial compensation for B-0 inhomogeneity.
   Conclusion: The 2D frequency-modulated pulses are a new class of pulses
   that generate phase coherence sequentially along a spatial trajectory
   determined by gradient-and frequency-modulated functions. By exploiting
   their spatiotemporal nature, 2D frequency-modulated pulses can
   compensate for spatial variation of the radiofrequency field in a
   single-shot excitation. Preliminary results shown suggest extensions
   might also be used to compensate for static field inhomogeneity. (C)

Journal = {{NATURE MICROBIOLOGY}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The early life microbiome plays important roles in host immunological
   and metabolic development. Because the incidence of type 1 diabetes
   (T1D) has been increasing substantially in recent decades, we
   hypothesized that early-life antibiotic use alters gut microbiota, which
   predisposes to disease. Using non-obese diabetic mice that are
   genetically susceptible to T1D, we examined the effects of exposure to
   either continuous low-dose antibiotics or pulsed therapeutic antibiotics
   (PAT) early in life, mimicking childhood exposures. We found that in
   mice receiving PAT, T1D incidence was significantly higher, and
   microbial community composition and structure differed compared with
   controls. In pre-diabetic male PAT mice, the intestinal lamina propria
   had lower Th17 and T-reg proportions and intestinal SAA expression than
   in controls, suggesting key roles in transducing the altered microbiota
   signals. PAT affected microbial lipid metabolism and host cholesterol
   biosynthetic gene expression. These findings show that early-life
   antibiotic treatments alter the gut microbiota and its metabolic
   capacities, intestinal gene expression and T-cell populations,
   accelerating T1D onset in non-obese diabetic mice.}},

Abstract = {{This study uses photoresist materials in combination with several
   optical filters as a diagnostic to examine the relative importance of
   VUV-induced surface modifications for different cold atmospheric
   pressure plasma (CAPP) sources. The argon fed kHz-driven ring-APPJ
   showed the largest ratio of VUV surface modification relative to the
   total modification introduced, whereas the MHz APPJ showed the largest
   overall surface modification. The MHz APPJ shows increased total
   thickness reduction and reduced VUV effect as oxygen is added to the
   feed gas, a condition that is often used for practical applications. We
   examine the influence of noble gas flow from the APPJ on the local
   environment. The local environment has a decisive impact on polymer
   modification from VUV emission as O-2 readily absorbs VUV photons.}},

Abstract = {{The structure, stability, and reorganization of lamella-forming block
   copolymer thin film surface topography ({''}islands{''} and ``holes{''})
   were studied under boundary conditions driving the formation of 0.5 L-0
   thick structures at short thermal annealing times. Self-consistent field
   theory predicts that the presence of one perfectly neutral surface
   renders 0.5 L-0 topography thermodynamically stable relative to 1 L-0
   thick features, in agreement with previous experimental observations.
   The calculated through-film structures match cross-sectional scanning
   electron micrographs, collectively demonstrating the pinning of edge
   dislocations at the neutral surface. Remarkably, near-neutral surface
   compositions exhibit 0.5 L-0 topography metastability upon extended
   thermal treatment, slowly transitioning to 1 L-0 islands or holes as
   evidenced by optical and atomic force microscopy. Surface restructuring
   is rationalized by invoking commensurability effects imposed by slightly
   preferential surfaces. The results described herein clarify the impact
   of interfacial interactions on block copolymer self-assembly and
   solidify an understanding of 0.5 L-0 topography, which is frequently
   used to determine neutral surface compositions of considerable
   importance to contemporary technological applications.}},

Abstract = {{With strong light matter interaction in their atomically thin layered
   structures, two-dimensional (2D) materials have been widely investigated
   for optoelectronic applications such as photodetectors and photovoltaic
   devices. Depending on the aim of optoelectronic applications, different
   device structures have been employed. Lateral phototransistor structures
   have been employed for high optical gain, while vertical photodiode
   structures have been employed for fast response and low power operation.
   Herein, we demonstrate a multimodal photodetector platform based on 2D
   materials, combining both a phototransistor and a photodiode and taking
   the corresponding desirable characteristics from each structure within a
   single device. In this platform, a multilayered transition-metal
   dichalcogenide flake is transferred on top of metal electrodes, and a
   transparent gate electrode is employed. The channel region of the flake
   between electrodes operates as a phototransistor providing a high gain
   mode, while the electrode region in the same flake operates as a
   vertical Schottky photodiode providing a fast response mode. These modes
   can be dynamically selected by controlling the drain voltage and gate
   voltage.}},

Abstract = {{The connections between walls of unreinforced masonry (URM) buildings
   and flexible timber diaphragms are critical building components that
   must perform adequately before desirable earthquake response of URM
   buildings may be achieved. Field observations made during the initial
   reconnaissance and the subsequent damage surveys of clay brick URM
   buildings following the 2010/2011 Canterbury, New Zealand, earthquakes
   revealed numerous cases where anchor connections joining masonry walls
   or parapets with roof or floor diaphragms appeared to have failed
   prematurely. These observations were more frequent for adhesive anchor
   connections than for through-bolt connections (i.e., anchorages having
   plates on the exterior facade of the masonry walls). Subsequently, an
   in-field test program was undertaken in an attempt to evaluate the
   performance of adhesive anchor connections between unreinforced clay
   brick URM walls and roof or floor diaphragm. The study consisted of a
   total of almost 400 anchor tests conducted in eleven existing URM
   buildings located in Christchurch, Whanganui and Auckland. Specific
   objectives of the study included the identification of failure modes of
   adhesive anchors in existing URM walls and the influence of the
   following variables on anchor load-displacement response: adhesive type,
   strength of the masonry materials (brick and mortar), anchor embedment
   depth, anchor rod diameter, overburden level, anchor rod type, quality
   of installation, and the use of metal mesh sleeves. In addition, the
   comparative performance of bent anchors (installed at an angle of
   minimum 22.5 degrees to the perpendicular projection from the wall
   surface) and anchors positioned horizontally was investigated.
   Observations on the performance of wall-to-diaphragm connections in the
   2010/2011 Canterbury earthquakes, a summary of the performed
   experimental program and test results, and a proposed pull-out capacity
   relationship for adhesive anchors installed into multi-leaf clay brick
   masonry are presented herein.}},

Abstract = {{There is an urgent treat of numerous chronic diseases including heart
   disease, stroke, cancer, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes,
   which have a significant influence on the health of people worldwide. In
   addition to numerous preventive and therapeutic drug treatments,
   important advances have been achieved in the identification of bioactive
   peptides that may contribute to long-term health. Although bioactive
   peptides with various biological activities received unprecedented
   attention, as a new source of bioactive peptides, the significant role
   of bioactive peptides from traditional Chinese medicine and traditional
   Chinese food has not fully appreciated compared to other bioactive
   components. Hence, identification and bioactivity assessment of these
   peptides could benefit the pharmaceutical and food industry.
   Furthermore, the functional properties of bioactive peptides help to
   demystify drug properties and health benefits of traditional Chinese
   medicine and traditional Chinese food. This paper reviews the generation
   and biofunctional properties of various bioactive peptides derived from
   traditional Chinese medicine and traditional Chinese food. Mechanisms of
   digestion, bioavailability of bioactive peptides and interactions

Abstract = {{Amyloid beta accumulation in neuronal and cerebrovascular tissue is a
   key precursor to development of Alzheimer's disease and can result in
   neurodegeneration. While its persistence in Alzheimer's cases is
   well-studied, amyloid beta's direct effect on vascular function is
   unclear. Here, we measured the effect of amyloid beta treatment on
   vascular smooth muscle cell functional contractility and modeled the
   mechanoadaptive growth and remodeling response to these functional
   perturbations. We found that the amyloid beta 1-42 isoform induced a
   reduction in vascular smooth muscle cell mechanical output and reduced
   response to vasocontractile cues. These data were used to develop a
   thin-walled constrained mixture arterial model that suggests vessel
   growth, and remodeling in response to amyloid betamediated alteration of
   smooth muscle function leads to decreased ability of cerebrovascular
   vessels to vasodilate. These findings provide a possible explanation for
   the vascular injury and malfunction often associated with the
   development of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.}},

Abstract = {{In many cities in Vietnam, wastewater generated in slaughterhouses is
   normally discharged directly into surfacewaters without treatment.
   Management of slaughterhouse wastewater (SHWW) is difficult due to the
   lack of infrastructure for conveyance to centralized facilities. On-site
   treatment presents one cost-effective way of managing SHWW compared to
   mass improvement of infrastructure. This study evaluates the application
   of an airlift membrane bioreactor (AL-MBR) for on-site treatment of
   SHWW. The concentrations of chemical oxygen demand (COD), biochemical
   oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN) and NH4+-N in the simulated
   SHWW were 1,697 +/- 317 mg/L, 891 +/- 137 mg/L, 246 +/- 65 mg/L and 171
   +/- 4.2 mg/L, respectively. The mixed-liquor volatile suspended solids
   in the aerobic and anoxic tanks were maintained at 5,000-6,000 mg/L. Air
   flow rate and cross flow velocity were maintained at 0.2 L/min and 0.8
   m/s, respectively, to keep the trans-membrane pressure (TMP) stable at
   0.8 bar and the membrane flux at 15-18 L/m(2) h bar (LMH/bar). The
   removal efficiencies of COD and TN were 95 +/- 1.9\% and 70 +/- 3.3\%,
   respectively, at a hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 2.5 days. This
   study shows that GL-MBR is a promising on-site solution for SHWW
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Concern has been raised over the infection risk of the TASER electrical
   weapon since the probes penetrate the skin. The manufacturing process
   produces unsterilized probes with a 5\% rate of Staphylococcus aureus
   contamination. Voluntary recipients (n = 208) of probe exposures were
   surveyed and there were no self-observations of infection. With over 3.3
   million probe landings, there have been 10 case reports of penetrations
   of sensitive tissue with no reported infections. The electrical field
   was modeled and found that the electrical pulses generate a field of
   over 1200 V/mm on the dart portion. This is sufficient to sterilize the
   dart via electroporation. Electrical weapon probes appear to have a very
   low (possibly zero) rate of infection. The factors leading to this low
   infection rate appear to be a manufacturing process producing a low rate
   of bacterial contamination and the pulses sterilizing the dart via
   electroporation.}},

Abstract = {{Dicarboxylic acids are attractive biosynthetic targets due to their
   broad applications and their challenging manufacturing process from
   fossil fuel feedstock. Mesaconate is a branched, unsaturated
   dicarboxylic acid that can be used as a co-monomer to produce hydrogels
   and fire-retardant materials. In this study, we engineered
   nonphosphorylative metabolism to produce mesaconate from D-xylose and
   L-arabinose. This nonphosphorylative metabolism is orthogonal to the
   intrinsic pentose metabolism in Escherichia call and has fewer enzymatic
   steps and a higher theoretical yield to TCA cycle intermediates than the
   pentose phosphate pathway. Here mesaconate production was enabled from
   the D-xylose pathway and the L-arabinose pathway. To enhance the
   transportation of D-xylose and L-arabinose, pentose transporters were
   examined. We identified the pentose/proton symporter, AraE, as the most
   effective transporter for both D-xylose and L-arabinose in mesaconate
   production process. Further production optimization was achieved by
   operon screening and metabolic engineering. These efforts led to the
   engineered strains that produced 12.5 g/l and 13.2 g/l mesaconate after
   48 h from 20 g/l of D-xylose and L-arabinose, respectively. Finally, the
   engineered strain overexpressing both L-arabinose and D-xylose operons
   produced 14.7 g/l mesaconate from a 1:1 D-xylose and L-arabinose mixture
   with a yield of 85\% of the theoretical maximum. (0.87 g/g). This work
   demonstrates an effective system that converts pentoses into a
   value-added chemical, mesaconate, with promising titer, rate, and yield.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite oxides form an eclectic class of materials owing to their
   structural flexibility in accommodating cations of different sizes and
   valences. They host well-known point and planar defects, but so far no
   line defect has been identified other than dislocations. Using
   analytical scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and ab
   initio calculations, we have detected and characterized the atomic and
   electronic structures of a novel line defect in NdTiO3 perovskite. It
   appears in STEM images as a perovskite cell rotated by 45 degrees. It
   consists of self-organized Ti-O vacancy lines replaced by Nd columns
   surrounding a central Ti-O octahedral chain containing Ti4+ ions, as
   opposed to Ti3+ in the host. The distinct Ti valence in this line defect
   introduces the possibility of engineering exotic conducting properties
   in a single preferred direction and tailoring novel desirable
   functionalities in this Mott insulator.}},

Abstract = {{We report real-space, time-resolved imaging of coherently excited
   acoustic phonon modes in plasmonic nanoparticles via femtosecond
   electron imaging with an ultrafast electron microscope. The particles
   studied were cetyl trimethylammonium bromide stabilized Au nanorods (40
   x 120 nm), and the particular specimen configurations for which
   photoinduced vibrational modes were visualized consisted of a single,
   isolated nanocrystal and a cluster of four irregularly arranged and
   randomly oriented particles, all supported on an amorphous Si3N4
   membrane. In both configurations, we are able to resolve discrete
   intraparticle acoustic phonon modes via diffraction-contrast modulation
   with bright-field femtosecond electron imaging. For the single nanorod,
   we spatiotemporally mapped the intraparticle vibrational energy
   distribution and decay times. With Fourier filtering, acoustic phonons
   ranging from 4 to 30 GHz (250 to 33 ps periods, respectively) were
   visualized, corresponding to bending, extensional, and higher-order
   modes. Furthermore, heterogeneously distributed intraparticle decay
   times, ranging from 3 to 10 ns, were spatially mapped, indicating a
   strong dependence on coupling of the mode to the underlying substrate.
   For a cluster of four randomly oriented nanorods, we are able to image
   acoustic phonon modes that are strongly localized to particular particle
   particle contact regions within the aggregate. A vibrational mode
   occurring at 27 GHz (37 ps period) was observed to occur at a 10 run
   side-to-end contact region, with other intraparticle points at distances
   of 20 and 50 nm from the region showing no such dynamics, although the
   initial few-picosecond diffraction-contrast response was observed
   changing sign in moving from the end to the center of the particle.
   Excellent agreement is found between the spatiotemporally mapped
   vibrational-mode symmetries and finite-element simulations of supported
   modes in a polymer-coated Au nanorod supported on a Si3N4 membrane. This
   experiment resolves both the structure and dynamic properties of the
   plasmonic assembly, providing insight into the characteristics of
   complex plasmonic assemblies that ultimately determine their response to
   ultrafast excitation.}},

Abstract = {{There is demand for non-dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) cryoprotective agents
   that maintain cell viability without causing poor postthaw function or
   systemic toxicity. The focus of this investigation involves expanding
   our understanding of multicomponent osmolyte solutions and their ability
   to preserve cell viability during freezing. Controlled cooling rate
   freezing, Raman microscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
   were utilized to evaluate the differences in recovery and ice crystal
   formation behavior for solutions containing multiple cryoprotectants,
   including sugars, sugar alcohols, and small molecule additives. Postthaw
   recovery of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in solutions containing
   multiple osmolytes have been shown to be comparable or better than that
   of MSCs frozen in 10\% DMSO at 1 degrees C/min when the solution
   composition is optimized. Maximum postthaw recovery was observed in
   these multiple osmolyte solutions with incubation times of up to 2 h
   before freezing. Raman images demonstrate large ice crystal formation in
   cryopreserved cells incubated for shorter periods of time (similar to 30
   min), suggesting that longer permeation times are needed for these
   solutions. Recovery was dependent upon the concentration of each
   component in solution, and was not strongly correlated with osmolarity.
   It is noteworthy that the postthaw recovery varied significantly with
   the composition of solutions containing the same three components and
   this variation exhibited an inverted U-shape behavior, indicating that
   there may be a ``sweet spot'' for different combinations of osmolytes.
   Raman images of freezing behavior in different solution compositions
   were consistent with the observed postthaw recovery. Phase change
   behavior (solidification patterns and glass-forming tendency) did not
   differ for solutions with similar osmolarity, but differences in
   postthaw recovery suggest that biological, not physical, methods of
   protection are at play. Lastly, molecular substitution of glucose (a
   monosaccharide) for sucrose (a disaccharide) resulted in a significant
   drop in recovery. Taken together, the information from these studies
   increases our understanding of non-DMSO multicomponent cryoprotective
   solutions and the manner by which they enhance postthaw recovery.}},

Title = {{Sensorimotor Rhythm BCI with Simultaneous High Definition-Transcranial

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{Background: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been used
   to alter the excitability of neurons within the cerebral cortex.
   Improvements in motor learning have been found in multiple studies when
   tDCS was applied to the motor cortex before or during task learning. The
   motor cortex is also active during the performance of motor imagination,
   a cognitive task during which a person imagines, but does not execute, a
   movement. Motor imagery can be used with noninvasive brain computer
   interfaces (BCIs) to control virtual objects in up to three dimensions,
   but to master control of such devices requires long training times.
   Objective: To evaluate the effect of high-definition tDCS on the
   performance and underlying electrophysiology of motor imagery based BCI.
   Methods: We utilize high-definition tDCS to investigate the effect of
   stimulation on motor imagery based BCI performance across and within
   sessions over multiple training days.
   Results: We report a decreased time-to-hit with anodal stimulation both
   within and across sessions. We also found differing electrophysiological
   changes of the stimulated sensorimotor cortex during online BCI task
   performance for left vs. right trials. Cathodal stimulation led to a
   decrease in alpha and beta band power during task performance compared
   to sham stimulation for right hand imagination trials.
   Conclusion: These results suggest that unilateral tDCS over the
   sensorimotor motor cortex differentially affects cortical areas based on
   task specific neural activation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Closed-Loop Deep Brain Stimulation Effects on Parkinsonian Motor
   Symptoms in a Non-Human Primate - Is Beta Enough?}},
Journal = {{BRAIN STIMULATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},

Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Incorporating feedback controls based on real-time measures
   of pathological brain activity may improve deep brain stimulation (DBS)
   approaches for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Excessive beta
   oscillations in subthalamic nucleus (STN) local field potentials (LFP)
   have been proposed as a potential biomarker for closed-loop DBS
   (CL-DBS).
   Objective: In a non-human primate PD model we compared CL-DBS, which
   delivered stimulation only when STN LFP beta activity was elevated, to
   traditional continuous DBS (tDBS).
   Methods: Therapeutic effects of CL-DBS and tDBS relative to the Off-DBS
   condition were evaluated via a clinical rating scale and objective
   measures of movement speed during a cued reaching task.
   Results: CL-DBS was comparable to tDBS at reducing rigidity, while
   reducing the amount of time DBS was on by approximate to 50\%; however,
   only tDBS improved bradykinesia during the reaching behavior. This was
   likely due to reach-related reductions in beta amplitude that influence
   the timing and duration of stimulation in the CL-DBS condition.
   Conclusion: These results illustrate the potential utility of
   closed-loop DBS devices for PD based on STN beta LFP levels. They also
   point to possible consequences in behavioral tasks when restricting
   real-time sensing to a single LFP frequency that itself is modulated
   during performance of such tasks. The present study provides data that
   suggest alternate algorithms or more than one physiological biomarker
   may be required to optimize the performance of behavioral tasks and
   demonstrates the value of using multiple objective measures when
   evaluating the efficacy of closed-loop DBS systems. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a 45 amino
   acid Gp2 domain, engineered to bind to epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR), as a positron emission tomography (PET) probe of EGFR in a
   xenograft mouse model. The EGFR-targeted Gp2 (Gp2-EGFR) and a nonbinding
   control were site-specifically labeled with
   1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclo-dodecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid (DOTA)
   chelator. Binding affinity was tested toward human EGFR and mouse EGFR
   Biological activity on downstream EGFR signaling was examined in cell
   culture. DOTA-Gp2 molecules were labeled with Cu-64 and intravenously
   injected (0.6-2.3 MBq) into mice bearing EGFR(high) (n = 7) and
   EGFR(low) (n = 4) xenografted tumors. PET/computed tomography (CT)
   images were acquired at 45 min 2 h, and 24 h. Dynamic PET (25 min) was
   also acquired. Tomography results were verified with gamma counting of
   resected tissues. Two-tailed t tests with unequal variances provided
   statistical comparison. DOTA-Gp2-EGFR bound strongly to human (K-D = 7
   +/- 5 nM) and murine (K-D = 29 +/- 6 nM) EGFR, and nontargeted Gp2 had
   no detectable binding. Gp2-EGFR did not agonize EGFR nor antagonize
   EGF-EGFR. Cu-64-Gp2-EGFR tracer effectively localized to EGFR(high)
   tumors at 45 min (3.2 +/- 0.5\%ID/g). High specificity was observed with
   significantly lower uptake in EGFR(low) tumors (0.9 +/- 0.3\%ID/g, p <
   0.001), high tumor-to-background ratios (11 +/- 6 tumor/muscle, p <
   0.001). Nontargeted Gp2 tracer had low uptake in EGFR(high) tumors (0.5
   +/- 0.3\%ID/g, p < 0.001). Similar data was observed at 2 h, and tumor
   signal was retained at 24 h (2.9 +/- 0.3\%ID/g). An engineered Gp2 PET
   imaging probe exhibited low background and target-specific EGFR(high)
   tumor uptake at 45 min, with tumor signal retained at 24 h
   postinjection, and compared favorably with published EGFR PET probes for
   alternative protein scaffolds. These beneficial in vivo characteristics,
   combined with thermal stability, efficient evolution, and small size of
   the Gp2 domain validate its use as a future class of molecular imaging
   agents.}},

Abstract = {{Yeast surface display has proven to be an effective tool in the
   discovery and evolution of ligands with new or improved binding
   activity. Selections for binding activity are generally carried out
   using immobilized or fluorescently labeled soluble domains of target
   molecules such as recombinant ectodomain fragments. While this method
   typically provides ligands with high affinity and specificity for the
   soluble molecular target, translation to binding true membrane-bound
   cellular target is commonly problematic. Direct selections against
   mammalian cell surfaces can be carried out either exclusively or in
   combination with soluble target-based selections to further direct
   towards ligands for genuine cellular target. Using a series of
   fibronectin domain, affibody, and Gp2 ligands and human cell lines
   expressing a range of their targets, epidermal growth factor receptor
   and carcinoembryonic antigen, this study quantitatively identifies the
   elements that dictate ligand enrichment and yield. Most notably,
   extended flexible linkers between ligand and yeast enhance enrichment
   ratios from 1.4 +/- 0.8 to 62 +/- 57 for a low-affinity (> 600 nM)
   binder on cells with high target expression and from 14 +/- 13 to 74 +/-
   25 for a high-affinity binder (2 nM) on cells with medium valency.
   Inversion of the yeast display fusion from C-terminal display to
   N-terminal display still enables enrichment albeit with 40-97\% reduced
   efficacy. Collectively, this study further enlightens the
   conditions-while highlighting new approaches-that yield successful
   enrichment of yeast-displayed binding ligands via panning on mammalian
   cells. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{For many applications of multimedia medical devices in clinical and
   medical issues, cloud computing becomes a very useful way. However, high
   energy consumption of cloud computing networks for these applications
   brings forth a large challenge. This paper studies the energy-efficient
   problem with QoS constraints in large-scale cloud computing networks. We
   use the sleeping and rate scaling mechanism to propose a link energy
   consumption model to characterize the network energy consumption. If
   there is no traffic on a link, we will let it be sleeping. Otherwise, it
   is activated and we divide its energy consumption into base energy
   consumption and traffic energy consumption. The former describes the
   constant energy consumption that exists when the link runs, while the
   later, which is a quadratic function with respect to the traffic,
   indicates the relations between link energy consumption and the traffic
   on the link. Then considering the relation among network energy
   consumption, number of active links, and QoS constraints, we build the
   multi-constrained energy efficient model to overcome the high energy
   consumption in large-scale cloud computing networks. Finally, we exploit
   the NSF and GEANT network topology to validate our model. Simulation
   results show that our approach can significantly improve energy
   efficiency of cloud computing networks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend the notion of locally repairable codes to secret
   sharing schemes. The main problem that we consider is to find optimal
   ways to distribute the shares of a secret among a set of storage-nodes
   (participants) such that the content of each node (share) can be
   recovered by using the contents of only few other nodes, and at the same
   time the secret can be reconstructed by only some allowable subsets of
   nodes. As a special case, an eavesdropper observing some set of specific
   nodes (such as less than certain number of nodes) does not get any
   information. In other words, we propose to study a locally repairable
   distributed storage system that is secure against a passive eavesdropper
   that can observe some subsets of nodes. We provide a number of results
   related to such systems, including upper bounds and achievability
   results on the number of bits that can be securely stored with these
   constraints. In particular, we provide conditions under which a locally
   repairable code can be turned into a secret sharing scheme and extend
   the results of secure repairable storage to cooperative repair and
   storage on networks. In addition, we consider perfect secret sharing
   schemes over general access structures under locality constraints and
   give an example of a perfect secret sharing scheme that can have small
   locality. Finally, we provide a lower bound on the size of a share
   compared with the size of the secret that shows how locality affects the
   sizes of shares in a perfect scheme.}},

Abstract = {{Matrix factorization is a popular approach for large-scale matrix
   completion. The optimization formulation based on matrix factorization,
   even with huge size, can be solved very efficiently through the standard
   optimization algorithms in practice. However, due to the non-convexity
   caused by the factorization model, there is a limited theoretical
   understanding of whether these algorithms will generate a good solution.
   In this paper, we establish a theoretical guarantee for the
   factorization-based formulation to correctly recover the underlying
   low-rank matrix. In particular, we show that under similar conditions to
   those in previous works, many standard optimization algorithms converge
   to the global optima of a factorization-based formulation and recover
   the true low-rank matrix. We study the local geometry of a properly
   regularized objective and prove that any stationary point in a certain
   local region is globally optimal. A major difference of this paper from
   the existing results is that we do not need resampling (i.e., using
   independent samples at each iteration) in either the algorithm or its
   analysis.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{260}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The spin crossover of iron in Fe3(+-)bearing bridgmanite, the most
   abundant mineral of the Earth's lower mantle, is by now a
   well-established phenomenon, though several aspects of this crossover
   remain unclear. Here we investigate effects of disorder, iron
   concentration, and temperature on this crossover using ab initio LDA +
   U-sc calculations. The effect of concentration and disorder are
   addressed using complete statistical samplings of coupled substituted
   configurations in super-cells containing up to 80 atoms. Vibrational
   thermal effects on the crossover are addressed within the quasiharmonic
   approximation. The effect of disorder seems quite small, while
   increasing iron concentration results in considerable increase in the
   crossover pressure. Our calculated compression curves for iron-free,
   Fe2+, and Fe3+-bearing bridgmanite compare well with the latest
   experimental measurements. The comparison also suggests that in a closed
   system, Fe2+-present in the sample may transform into Fe3+ by
   introduction of Mg and O vacancies with increasing pressure. As in the
   spin crossover in ferropericlase, this crossover in bridgmanite is
   accompanied by a clear volume reduction and an anomalous softening of
   the bulk modulus throughout the crossover pressure range. These effects
   reduce significantly with increasing temperature. Though the
   concentration of {[}Fe3+](Si) in bridgmanite may be small, related
   elastic anomalies may impact the interpretation of radial and lateral
   velocity structures of the Earth's lower mantle. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{This paper develops analytical sensing principles for estimation of
   circumferential size of a cylindrical surface using magnetic sensors. An
   electromagnet and magnetic sensors are used on a wearable band for
   measurement of leg size. In order to enable robust size estimation
   during rough real-world use of the wearable band, three estimation
   algorithms are developed based on models of the magnetic field variation
   over a cylindrical surface. The magnetic field models developed include
   those for a dipole and for a uniformly magnetized cylinder. The
   estimation algorithms used include a linear regression equation, an
   extended Kalman filter and an unscented Kalman filter. Experimental
   laboratory tests show that the size sensor in general performs
   accurately, yielding sub-millimeter estimation errors. The unscented
   Kalman filter yields the best performance that is robust to bias and
   misalignment errors. The size sensor developed herein can be used for
   monitoring swelling due to fluid accumulation in the lower leg and a
   number of other biomedical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Because of its highly efficient homologous recombination, the moss
   Physcomitrella patens is a model organism particularly suited for
   reverse genetics, but this inherent characteristic limits forward
   genetic approaches. Here, we show that the tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)
   retrotransposon Tnt1 efficiently transposes in P.patens, being the first
   retrotransposon from a vascular plant reported to transpose in a
   bryophyte. Tnt1 has a remarkable preference for insertion into genic
   regions, which makes it particularly suited for gene mutation. In order
   to stabilize Tnt1 insertions and make it easier to select for
   insertional mutants, we have developed a two-component system where a
   mini-Tnt1 with a retrotransposition selectable marker can only transpose
   when Tnt1 proteins are co-expressed from a separate expression unit. We
   present a new tool with which to produce insertional mutants in P.patens
   in a rapid and straightforward manner that complements the existing
   molecular and genetic toolkit for this model species.

Abstract = {{Algal biofuels are becoming more economically competitive due to
   technological advances and government subsidies offering tax benefits
   and lower cost financing. These factors are linked, however, as the
   value of technical advances is affected by modeling assumptions
   regarding the growth conditions, process design, and financing of the
   production facility into which novel techniques are incorporated. Two
   such techniques, related to algal growth and dewatering, are evaluated
   in representative operating and financing scenarios using an integrated
   techno-economic model. Results suggest that these techniques can be
   valuable under specified conditions, but also that investment subsidies
   influence cost competitive facility design by incentivizing development
   of more capital intensive facilities (e.g., favoring hydrothermal
   liquefaction over transesterification-based facilities). Evaluating
   novel techniques under a variety of operational and financial scenarios
   highlights the set of site-specific conditions in which technical
   advances are most valuable, while also demonstrating the influence of
   subsidies linked to capital intensity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Corrections for lateral conduction error in steady state heat transfer

Abstract = {{Steady state measurements of convective heat transfer coefficient often
   use a constant wall heat flux condition along with measured temperature
   distribution to generate heat transfer coefficient maps. Large spatial
   gradients in the heat transfer coefficient may lead to lateral
   conduction within the heater foil, causing non-uniformity in the actual
   convective flux into the fluid, yielding errors in the calculated
   Nusselt numbers. This paper presents an analytical procedure for
   correcting such errors for a model system with a known heat transfer
   coefficient distribution and nominal 1-D applied wall heat flux. The
   resulting 2-D conduction problem is parametrized in terms of the Biot
   number Bi and the heat transfer coefficient distribution, expressed by
   the change in magnitude rho and the peak gradient gamma, as well as the
   proximity of the gradient region to a symmetry plane. Three model
   configurations are studied: a region of large gradients that is located
   far away from lateral boundaries, and two cases where the gradient
   region is located near a symmetry plane, viz, impingement heat transfer
   due to a slot jet and a round jet. It is shown that sharp spatial
   variations in heat transfer coefficient can lead to significant error in
   Nusselt number determination when the wall heat flux is assumed to be
   uniform. The error is shown to be amplified when the gradient region is
   located near a symmetry plane. Finally, the wall heat flux is correlated
   using of an expression that captures the results of the analytical
   calculations for the ranges of Bi, rho and gamma studied, which can be
   used to evaluate experimental designs for heat transfer measurement, and
   make corrections for the two-dimensional nature of heat transfer in the
   foil and insulation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Biofuel feedstocks provide a renewable energy source that can reduce
   fossil fuel emissions; however, if produced on a large scale they can
   also impact local to regional water and carbon budgets. Simulation
   results for 2005-2014 from a regional weather model adapted to simulate
   the growth of two perennial grass biofuel feedstocks suggest that
   replacing at least half the current annual cropland with these grasses
   would increase water use efficiency and drive greater rainfall downwind
   of perturbed grid cells, but increased evapotranspiration (ET) might
   switch the Mississippi River basin from having a net warm-season surplus
   of water (precipitation minus ET) to a net deficit. While this scenario
   reduces land required for biofuel feedstock production relative to
   current use for maize grain ethanol production, it only offsets
   approximately one decade of projected anthropogenic warming and
   increased water vapor results in greater atmospheric heat content.}},

Abstract = {{We explore by computational modeling the effects of boron nitrogen (BN)
   composition on the thermal and mechanical properties of amorphous
   silicon boron nitride (Si-B-N), a synthetic ceramic material with
   superior thermal protection, mechanical attributes, and oxidation
   resistance at high temperatures. Network-derived Si-B-N models optimized
   with ab initio molecular dynamics serve as input structures for
   classical molecular dynamics simulations. Atomistic Green Kubo
   simulations on relaxed supercells and structural relaxations on strained
   cells are used to screen the thermal and mechanical properties of a
   collection of network structures with low enthalpies of formation. We
   find that when the material is composed of well-mixed parts rather
   homogeneously spread within the material, the thermal conductivity and
   elastic constants are isotropic and exhibit a weak dependence on
   composition and network structure. In contrast, when separation into
   BN-rich layers occurs, the material exhibits anisotropic behavior, with
   an increase in thermal conductivity along the layer direction and
   decrease in elastic constant in the cross-layer direction. The insights
   provided into the composition structure property relationships can be
   useful for the rational design of amorphous Si-B-N materials targeting
   high-performance coating applications.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric excipients are crucial ingredients in modern pills, increasing
   the therapeutic bioavailability, safety, stability, and accessibility of
   lifesaving products to combat diseases in developed and developing
   countries worldwide. Because many early-pipeline drugs are clinically
   intractable due to hydrophobicity and crystallinity, new solubilizing
   excipients can reposition successful and even failed compounds to more
   effective and inexpensive oral formulations. With assistance from
   high-throughput controlled polymerization and screening tools, we
   employed a strategic, molecular evolution approach to systematically
   modulate designer excipients based on the cyclic imide chemical groups
   of an important (yet relatively insoluble) drug phenytoin. In these
   acrylamide-and methacrylate-containing polymers, a synthon approach was
   employed: one monomer served as a precipitation inhibitor for phenytoin
   recrystallization, while the comonomer provided hydrophilicity. Systems
   that maintained drug supersaturation in amorphous solid dispersions were
   identified with molecular-level understanding of noncovalent
   interactions using NOESY and DOSY NMR spectroscopy.
   Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide-co-N, N-dimethylacrylamide)
   (poly(NIPAm-co-DMA)) at 70 mol \% NIPAm exhibited the highest drug
   solubilization, in which phenytoin associated with inhibiting NIPAm
   units only with lowered diffusivity in solution. In vitro dissolution
   tests of select spray-dried dispersions corroborated the screening
   trends between polymer chemical composition and solubilization
   performance, where the best NIPAm/DMA polymer elevated the mean
   area-under-the-dissolution-curve by 21 times its crystalline state at 10
   wt \% drug loading. When administered to rats for pharmacokinetic
   evaluation, the same leading poly(NIPAm-co-DMA) formulation tripled the
   oral bioavailability compared to a leading commercial excipient, HPMCAS,
   and translated to a remarkable 23-fold improvement over crystalline
   phenytoin.}},

Abstract = {{Molten-salt thermocline-based systems are a low-cost option for
   single-tank thermal energy storage in concentrated solar power plants.
   Due to the high variability in solar energy availability, these energy
   storage devices are subject to transient heat loads during charging that
   can affect the storage efficiency. Numerical simulations were conducted
   to analyze the stability characteristics of a lab-scale thermocline tank
   subject to a flow disturbance during charging under different operating
   temperatures. The charging process was first simulated at a constant
   Reynolds number for three different Atwood numbers; a stably stratified
   fluid layer develops inside the storage tank in all cases. A flow
   disturbance was then introduced at the inlet of the stratified
   thermocline tank by inserting colder fluid for a short period of time.
   The disturbance interacts with the thermocline and causes oscillations
   and mixing. The thermocline oscillations are under-damped and lead to an
   increase in thermocline region thickness. The transient behavior of the
   thermocline and the decay rate in its oscillations were analyzed; the
   damping time depends on the Atwood number. The persistence of flow
   disturbance effects during long-term cyclical operation was also
   investigated. Several charge/discharge cycles were simulated at constant
   Reynolds number to obtain a time-periodic thermal response for each
   Atwood number. The characteristic flow disturbance was introduced at the
   inlet during a single charging process, and the thermocline region was
   observed during several subsequent charge/discharge cycles to assess the
   long-term temporal attenuation of the disturbance. The thermocline
   almost fully recovers to the time-periodic behavior after a single
   cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We have established the existence of a line of congruent first order
   lamellar-to-disorder (LAM DIS) transitions when appropriate amounts of
   poly(cyclohexylethylene) (C) and poly(ethylene) (E) homopolymers are
   mixed with a corresponding compositionally symmetric CE diblock
   copolymer. The line of congruent transitions, or the congruent isopleth,
   terminates at the bicontinuous microemulsion (B mu E) channel, and its
   trajectory appears to be influenced by the critical composition of the
   C/E binary homopolymer blend. Blends satisfying congruency undergo a
   direct LAM DIS transition without passing through a two-phase region. We

   coexistence windows, which converge, along with the line of congruent
   transitions, at an overall composition in the phase prism coincident

Title = {{SparRec: An effective matrix completion framework of missing data
   imputation for GWAS}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{OCT 20}},
Abstract = {{Genome-wide association studies present computational challenges for
   missing data imputation, while the advances of genotype technologies are
   generating datasets of large sample sizes with sample sets genotyped on
   multiple SNP chips. We present a new framework SparRec (Sparse Recovery)
   for imputation, with the following properties: (1) The optimization
   models of SparRec, based on low-rank and low number of co-clusters of
   matrices, are different from current statistics methods. While our
   low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) model is similar to Mendel-Impute, our
   matrix co-clustering factorization (MCCF) model is completely new. (2)
   SparRec, as other matrix completion methods, is flexible to be applied
   to missing data imputation for large meta-analysis with different
   cohorts genotyped on different sets of SNPs, even when there is no
   reference panel. This kind of meta-analysis is very challenging for
   current statistics based methods. (3) SparRec has consistent performance
   and achieves high recovery accuracy even when the missing data rate is
   as high as 90\%. Compared with Mendel-Impute, our low-rank based method
   achieves similar accuracy and efficiency, while the co-clustering based
   method has advantages in running time. The testing results show that
   SparRec has significant advantages and competitive performance over
   other state-of-the-art existing statistics methods including Beagle and
   fastPhase.}},

Abstract = {{To better understand the physical mechanisms responsible for foreign

   previously inaccessible by approaches using analytical approximations.
   The steady-state model is able to evaluate critical engulfment
   velocities, which are further validated using the dynamic model. When
   compared with experimental results for the SiC-Si system, our model
   predicts a more realistic scaling of critical velocity with particle
   size than that predicted by prior theories. Discrepancies between model
   predictions and experimental results for larger particles are posited to
   arise from dynamic effects, a topic worthy of future attention. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A comprehensive mathematical model of the traveling heater method is
   applied to understand interactions of flow, segregation, and stability
   for the crystal growth by the traveling heater method. We demonstrate
   that the formation of a secondary, counter-rotating vortex near the
   growth interface limits the transport of segregated solvent, leading to
   large concentration gradients and supercooling of the liquid near the
   interface. The secondary vortex arises from the same mechanism
   responsible for the formation of lee waves in atmospheric flows, and its
   spatial form scales with the Brunt-Vaisala frequency. Significantly,
   this supercooled layer of liquid arises from the lateral transport of
   solute, which is predominantly affected by the secondary flow vortex,
   rather than the axial diffusion of solute, as assumed in the classical
   derivation of constitutional supercooling by Mullins and Sekerka. Thus,
   supercooling in a model cadmium zinc telluride system occurs at growth
   rates of order 1 mm/day, nearly an order of magnitude smaller than
   expected from classical arguments. Paradoxically, the traditional
   strategy to alleviate constitutional supercooling during crystal growth,
   namely increasing the temperature gradient at the interface, is expected
   to strengthen the lee-wave vortex and accentuate the onset of
   instability. Other approaches will be needed to overcome growth limits
   in the traveling heater method. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We present a fully coupled model for the traveling heater method (THM)
   under microgravity conditions and a rotating magnetic field (RMF) and
   apply it to analyze the growth of cadmium zinc telluride (CZT). The
   model provides a self-consistent representation of fluid flow and heat
   and mass transfer in a liquid zone shaped by dissolution and growth
   interfaces that are computed to satisfy local transport and
   thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. The temperature, stream function,
   tellurium, and zinc profiles in the liquid are analyzed with and without
   the rotating magnetic field. Results show that the system is very
   sensitive to the growth rate under microgravity alone, leading to
   tellurium accumulation, a concave growth interface, and constitutional
   supercooling at faster growth rates. While RMF-induced convection mixes
   the zone, creates a more uniform composition, and makes the microgravity
   system less sensitive to growth rate variations, RMF can also lead to
   undesirable outcomes. In particular, for stronger RMF fields, flows are
   driven inward along the growth interface, and the resulting accumulation
   of tellurium near the centerline results in localized interface
   concavity and liquid supercooling. The mechanisms behind the above
   phenomena are clarified, and some advice is provided for applying the
   RMF appropriately to THM CZT growth under microgravity conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{Despite environmental and economic advantages associated with
   incorporating recycled asphalt shingles (RAS) and reclaimed asphalt
   pavement (RAP) in hot-mix asphalt (HMA), concerns focus on fatigue and
   low-temperature cracking potential of pavements containing RAS and RAP.
   This study was undertaken to identify the areas in need for research
   through conducting a national survey among departments of transportation
   and to evaluate the effects of RAS and RAP on fatigue, low-temperature
   cracking and stiffness of HMA. National survey results indicated that
   while the fatigue cracking is the major concern when RAS and/or RAP are
   used in mixes, no specific test is recommended for fatigue evaluation of
   these mixes at the mix design stage. It was found that, fatigue life of
   mixes with a non-polymer-modified binder containing a blend of 5\% RAS
   and 5\% RAP led to the maximum increase in fatigue life. However,
   incorporation of 6\% RAS decreased the fatigue life of mixes, when
   compared with virgin mix. Also, it was found that addition of RAS and/or
   RAP to asphalt mixes increased their dynamic moduli which may result in
   a better rutting performance. From creep compliance test results it was
   concluded that use of RAS and/or RAP may lead to a higher
   low-temperature cracking potential when compared with the virgin mixes.
   Findings of this study can be used to develop/update guidelines/special
   provisions for design of HMA containing RAS and RAP. (C) 2016 Published

Abstract = {{The ability to rationally target disease-causing mutations has been made
   possible with programmable nucleases with the clustered, regularly

   mutations to the Fanconi anemia I (FANCI) gene to generate induced
   pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). This process was accomplished without
   gene complementation and the resultant iPSCs were able to be gene
   corrected in a robust manner using the Cas9 nickase. The self-renewing
   iPSCs that were maintained under feeder-free conditions were
   differentiated into cells with characteristics of definitive
   hematopoiesis. This defined and highly efficient procedure employed
   small molecule modulation of the hematopoietic differentiation pathway
   and a vascular induction technique to generate hematopoietic

   optics and imaging, where it is known as phase retrieval. This paper
   proposes two new phase retrieval algorithms based on nonconvex

   recently proposed approximation technique dubbed feasible point pursuit

   least-squares criterion (LS-FPP). Their performance is measured against
   state-of-the-art algorithms and the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB), which is
   also derived here. Simulations show that LS-FPP outperforms the existing
   schemes and operates close to the CRB. Compact CRB expressions,
   properties, and insights are obtained by explicitly computing the CRB in
   various special cases-including when the signal of interest admits a
   sparse parametrization, using harmonic retrieval as an example.}},

Abstract = {{Nonconvex quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP)
   problems have numerous applications in signal processing, machine
   learning, and wireless communications, albeit the general QCQP is
   NP-hard, and several interesting special cases are NP-hard as well. This
   paper proposes a new algorithm for general QCQP. The problem is first
   reformulated in consensus optimization form, to which the alternating
   direction method of multipliers can be applied. The reformulation is
   done in such a way that each of the subproblems is a QCQP with only one
   constraint (QCQP-1), which is efficiently solvable irrespective of (non)
   convexity. The core components are carefully designed to make the
   overall algorithm more scalable, including efficient methods for solving
   QCQP-1, memory efficient implementation, parallel/distributed
   implementation, and smart initialization. The proposed algorithm is then
   tested in two applications: multicast beamforming and phase retrieval.
   The results indicate superior performance over prior state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{Estimating the power spectrum of a wide-sense stationary random process
   is an important component of several signal processing tasks.
   Distributed spectrum sensing problems naturally emerge in cases where
   measurements of different realizations of a random process are collected
   at multiple spatial locations. This paper proposes a distributed power
   spectrum sensing framework for autoregressive (AR) and autoregressive
   moving-average (ARMA) processes. The sensing model comprises a network
   of scattered sensors which transmit randomly filtered, sample averaged,
   one bit quantized power measurements to a fusion center. First, assuming
   that sample averaging at each sensor is sufficient to converge to the
   ensemble average, it is shown that AR and ARMA power spectrum estimation
   from the received bits can be cast as (non-convex) optimization problems
   with special structure. Next, the sample averaging requirement is
   relaxed and maximum likelihood formulations are proposed, which take
   into account errors caused by quantization of inaccurate soft power
   measurements. Leveraging the block separable structure present in these
   formulations, we propose Block Coordinate Descent algorithms for
   obtaining approximate solutions, with favorable convergence properties.
   Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches
   for reconstructing power spectra from relatively few bits, when the
   model parametrization is valid.}},

Abstract = {{Live bacteria (such as probiotics) have long been used to modulate gut
   microbiota and human physiology, but their colonization is mostly
   transient. Conceptual understanding of the ecological principles as they
   apply to exogenously introduced microbes in gut ecosystems is lacking.
   We find that, when orally administered to humans, Bifidobacterium longum
   AH1206 stably persists in the gut of 30\% of individuals for at least 6
   months without causing gastrointestinal symptoms or impacting the
   composition of the resident gut microbiota. AH1206 engraftment was
   associated with low abundance of resident B. longum and
   underrepresentation of specific carbohydrate utilization genes in the
   pre-treatment microbiome. Thus, phylogenetic limiting and resource
   availability are two factors that control the niche opportunity for
   AH1206 colonization. These findings suggest that bacterial species and
   functional genes absent in the gut microbiome of individual humans can
   be reestablished, providing opportunities for precise and personalized
   microbiome reconstitution.}},

Abstract = {{Printed, low-voltage poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) electrolyte-gated
   transistors (EGTs) have favorable quasi-static characteristics,
   including sub 2 V operation, carrier mobility (mu) of 1 cm(2)/(V s),
   ON/OFF current ratio of 10(6), and static leakage current density of
   10(-6) A/cm(2). Here we study the dynamic performance of P3HT EGTs in
   which the semiconductor, dielectric, and gate electrode were deposited
   using aerosol-jet printing; the source and drain electrodes were
   patterned by conventional microlithography. With a source-to-drain
   separation of 2.5 mu m, the highest theoretical achievable switching
   frequency is similar to 10 MHz, assuming the movement of charge through
   the semiconductor is the limiting step. However, the measured maximum
   switching frequency of P3HT EGTs to date is similar to 1 kHz, implying
   that another process is slowing the response. By systematically varying
   the device geometry, we show that the frequency is limited by the
   capacitance between the gate and drain (i.e., parasitic capacitance).
   The traditional scaling of switching time with the square of channel
   length (L) does not hold for P3HT EGTs. Rather, minimizing the size of
   the drain electrode increases the maximum switching speed. We achieve 10
   kHz for P3HT EGTs with source/drain electrode dimensions of 2.5 mu m x

Abstract = {{Semi-crystalline polylactide (PLA)/polyolefin multi-component blends
   were used as precursors for the generation of a new class of
   micro-cellular polymers. Either a polypropylene-based elastomer (PBE) or
   polypropylene (PP) homopolymer were utilized as dispersed phases at the
   10 wt\% level. An epoxy-functionalized terpolymer (PEGMMA) was
   introduced (1 wt\%) as a reactive compatibilizer to reduce the dispersed
   phase droplet size and provide sufficient adhesion between the matrix
   and dispersed phase. In addition, a polyalkylene glycol liquid (PAG) was
   added to the blend (4 wt\%) to serve as a PLA plasticizer and
   interfacial modifier. The multicomponent blends exhibited significant
   increases in strain at break as compared to neat PLA and were subjected
   to a range of uniaxial strains (10-90\%) at room temperature. These cold
   drawn materials exhibited nearly constant cross-sectional area and fine
   microcellular structures, as revealed by scanning electron microscopy.
   Distinct different voiding mechanisms observed for the PBE- and
   PP-containing blends were ascribed to the differences in the dispersed
   phase elastic moduli and deformability. The material density of cold
   drawn blends was reduced by up to 34\% when compared to the precursor
   blends without a noticeable change in cross-sectional area. The novel
   low-density microcellular PLA blends demonstrated outstanding mechanical
   properties such as high strength, high modulus, substantial ductility,
   and a 14-fold increase in impact resistance as compared to PLA
   homopolymer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of molecular weight (MW) and comonomer content (CC) on the
   catalytic hydrogen-deuterium exchange process (CHDEP) in a series of
   polyethylenes has been studied using a band filter based SEC-IR method.
   CHDEP permits deuterium labeling of polyolefins prepared by any
   synthetic route, a major advantage over the traditional method of
   polymerizing deuterated monomers. However, incompleteness in
   deuterium-exchange as well as heterogeneity in deuterium distribution
   are known challenges to deuterium labeling of heterogeneous polymers by
   this method. These factors complicate small angle neutron scattering
   (SANS) studies, in which the average deuterium-exchange level (DL) and
   deuterium distribution are critical. A band-filter based size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC)-infrared absorption (IR) technique is presented as
   a simple but accurate method to quantify the DL as a function of MW. The
   DL of a series of ethylene-alpha olefin copolymers has been found to
   increase with MW but does not depend strongly on CC for all the
   polyethylene samples. This behavior has been further confirmed with
   independent measurements of average DL as a function of weight-averaged
   MW of a series of fractions from a deuterated linear low density
   polyethylene. The SEC results for the fractions are in agreement with
   deuterium measurements on the fractions using NMR spectroscopy, density
   and FTIR. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   of magnitude faster than expected based on the chain exchange
   measurements of equivalent diblock polymers. By accounting for two
   factors a bias toward shorter end-block lengths in the gel relaxation,
   and a reduction in the energy barrier to chain pullout caused by the

Title = {{Dynamics of ellipsoidal tracers in swimming algal suspensions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Enhanced diffusion of passive tracers immersed in active fluids is a
   universal feature of active fluids and has been extensively studied in
   recent years. Similar to microrheology for equilibrium complex fluids,
   the unusual enhanced particle dynamics reveal intrinsic properties of
   active fluids. Nevertheless, previous studies have shown that the
   translational dynamics of spherical tracers are qualitatively similar,
   independent of whether active particles are pushers or pullers-the two
   fundamental classes of active fluids. Is it possible to distinguish
   pushers from pullers by simply imaging the dynamics of passive tracers?
   Here, we investigated the diffusion of isolated ellipsoids in algal C.
   reinhardtii suspensions-a model for puller-type active fluids. In
   combination with our previous results on pusher-type E. coli suspensions
   {[}Peng et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 116, 068303 (2016)], we showed that the
   dynamics of asymmetric tracers show a profound difference in pushers and
   pullers due to their rotational degree of freedom. Although the
   laboratory-frame translation and rotation of ellipsoids are enhanced in
   both pushers and pullers, similar to spherical tracers, the anisotropic
   diffusion in the body frame of ellipsoids shows opposite trends in the
   two classes of active fluids. An ellipsoid diffuses fastest along its
   major axis when immersed in pullers, whereas it diffuses slowest along
   the major axis in pushers. This striking difference can be qualitatively
   explained using a simple hydrodynamic model. In addition, our study on
   algal suspensions reveals that the influence of the near-field advection
   of algal swimming flows on the translation and rotation of ellipsoids
   shows different ranges and strengths. Our work provides not only new
   insights into universal organizing principles of active fluids, but also
   a convenient tool for detecting the class of active particles.}},

Title = {{Estimating KIR Haplotype Frequencies on a Cohort of 10,000 Individuals:

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{The killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) mediate human
   natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity via activating or inhibiting
   signals. Although informative and functional haplotype patterns have
   been reported, most genotyping has been performed at resolutions that
   are structurally ambiguous. In order to leverage structural information
   given low-resolution genotypes, we performed experiments to quantify the
   effects of population variations, reference haplotypes, and genotyping
   resolutions on population-level haplotype frequency estimations as well
   as predictions of individual haplotypes. We genotyped 10,157 unrelated
   individuals in 5 populations (518 African American{[}AFA], 258 Asian or
   Pacific Islander {[}API], 8,245 European{[}EUR], 1,073 Hispanic{[}HIS],
   and 63 Native American{[}NAM]) for KIR gene presence/absence (PA), and
   additionally half of the AFA samples for KIR gene copy number variation
   (CNV). A custom EM algorithm was used to estimate haplotype frequencies
   for each population by interpretation in the context of three sets of
   reference haplotypes. The algorithm also assigns each individual the
   haplotype pairs of maximum likelihood. Generally, our haplotype
   frequency estimates agree with similar previous publications to within
   <5\% difference for all haplotypes. The exception is that estimates for
   NAM from the U.S. showed higher frequency association of cB02 with tA01
   (+14\%) instead of tB01 (-8.5\%) compared to a previous study of NAM
   from south of the U.S. The higher-resolution CNV genotyping on the AFA
   samples allowed unambiguous haplotype-pair assignments for the majority
   of individuals, resulting in a 22\% higher median typing resolution
   score (TRS), which measures likelihood of self-match in the context of
   population-specific haplo- and geno-types. The use of TRS to quantify
   reduced ambiguity with CNV data clearly revealed the few individuals
   with ambiguous genotypes as outliers. It is observed that typing
   resolution and reference haplotype set influence haplotype frequency
   estimates. For example, PA resolution may be used with reference
   haplotype sets up to the point where certain haplotypes are gene-content
   subsets of others. At that point, CNV must be used for all genes.}},

Title = {{Coherent dynamics in the rotor tip shear layer of utility-scale wind
   turbines}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{804}},
Pages = {{90-115}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Recent field experiments conducted in the near wake (up to 0.5 rotor
   diameters downwind of the rotor) of a Clipper Liberty C96 2.5 MW wind
   turbine using snow-based super-large-scale particle image velocimetry
   (SLPIV) (Hong et al., Nat. Commun., vol. 5, 2014, 4216) were successful
   in visualizing tip vortex cores as areas devoid of snowflakes. The
   so-visualized snow voids, however, suggested tip vortex cores of complex
   shape consisting of circular cores with distinct elongated comet-like
   tails. We employ large-eddy simulation (LES) to elucidate the structure
   and dynamics of the complex tip vortices identified experimentally. We
   show that the LES, with inflow conditions representing as closely as
   possible the state of the flow approaching the turbine when the SLPIV
   experiments were carried out, reproduce vortex cores in good qualitative
   agreement with the SLPIV results, essentially capturing all vortex core
   patterns observed in the field in the tip shear layer. The computed
   results show that the visualized vortex patterns are formed by the tip
   vortices and a second set of counter-rotating spiral vortices
   intertwined with the tip vortices. To probe the dependence of these
   newly uncovered coherent flow structures on turbine design, size and
   approach flow conditions, we carry out LES for three additional
   turbines: (i) the Scaled Wind Farm Technology (SWiFT) turbine developed
   by Sandia National Laboratories in Lubbock, TX, USA; (ii) the wind
   turbine developed for the European collaborative MEXICO (Model
   Experiments in Controlled Conditions) project; and (iii) the model
   turbine presented in the paper by Lignarolo et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol.
   781, 2015, pp. 467-493), and the Clipper turbine under varying inflow
   turbulence conditions. We show that similar counter-rotating vortex
   structures as those observed for the Clipper turbine are also observed
   for the SWiFT, MEXICO and model wind turbines. However, the strength of
   the counter-rotating vortices relative to that of the tip vortices from
   the model turbine is significantly weaker. We also show that incoming
   flows with low level turbulence attenuate the elongation of the tip and
   counter-rotating vortices. Sufficiently high turbulence levels in the
   incoming flow, on the other hand, tend to break up the coherence of
   spiral vortices in the near wake. To elucidate the physical mechanism
   that gives rise to such rich coherent dynamics we examine the stability
   of the turbine tip shear layer using the theory proposed by Leibovich \&
   Stewartson (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 126, 1983, pp. 335-356). We show that
   for all simulated cases the theory consistently indicates the flow to be
   unstable exactly in the region where counter-rotating spirals emerge. We
   thus postulate that centrifugal instability of the rotating turbine tip
   shear layer is a possible mechanism for explaining the phenomena we have

Abstract = {{Chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometers are used to study
   atmospheric nucleation by detecting clusters produced by reactions of
   sulfuric acid and various basic gases. These instruments typically use
   nitrate to deprotonate and thus chemically ionize the clusters. In this
   study, we compare cluster concentrations measured using either nitrate
   or acetate. Clusters were formed in a flow reactor from vapors of
   sulfuric acid and dimethylamine, ethylene diamine, tetramethylethylene
   diamine, or butanediamine (also known as putrescine). These comparisons
   show that nitrate is unable to chemically ionize clusters with high base
   content. In addition, we vary the ion-molecule reaction time to probe
   ion processes which include proton-transfer, ion-molecule clustering,
   and decomposition of ions. Ion decomposition upon deprotonation by
   acetate/nitrate was observed. More studies are needed to quantify to
   what extent ion decomposition affects observed cluster content and
   concentrations, especially those chemically ionized with acetate since
   it deprotonates more types of clusters than nitrate.
   Model calculations of the neutral and ion cluster formation pathways are
   also presented to better identify the cluster types that are not
   efficiently deprotonated by nitrate. Comparison of model and measured
   clusters indicate that sulfuric acid dimers with two diamines and
   sulfuric acid trimers with two or more base molecules are not
   efficiently chemical ionized by nitrate. We conclude that acetate CI
   provides bet-ter information on cluster abundancies and their base
   content than nitrate CI.}},

   The extensive use of in vitro tissue culture models in simulant matrix
   has proven effective at studying such interactions, but modalities for
   non-invasively quantifying aspects of these systems are scant. We
   present the novel application of an imaging technique, Inverse
   Spectroscopic Optical Coherence Tomography, for the non-destructive
   measurement of in vitro biological samples during matrix remodeling. Our
   findings indicate that the nanoscale-sensitive mass density correlation
   shape factor D of cancer cells increases in response to a more

Abstract = {{A prominent challenge in replacing petrochemical polymers with

   useful monomers. In this work, we demonstrate a practical process for
   the synthesis of multifunctional alcohols from five-and six-carbon acids

   was guided by thermodynamic calculations, which indicate the need for
   two sequential high-pressure hydrogenations: one, reduction of the acid
   to a lactone at high temperature; two, further reduction of the lactone
   to the corresponding diol or triol at low temperature. For example, the
   conversion of mesaconic acid into (alpha or
   beta)-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone was achieved with 95\% selectivity at a
   turnover frequency of 1.2 min(-1) over Pd/C at 240 degrees C. Subsequent
   conversion of (alpha or beta)-methyl-gamma-butyrolactone into
   2-methyl-1,4-butanediol was achieved with a yield of 80\% with Ru/C at

Title = {{Noninvasive Imaging of Human Atrial Activation during Atrial Flutter and
   Normal Rhythm from Body Surface Potential Maps}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 5}},
Abstract = {{Background
   Knowledge of atrial electrophysiological properties is crucial for
   clinical intervention of atrial arrhythmias and the investigation of the
   underlying mechanism. This study aims to evaluate the feasibility of a
   novel noninvasive cardiac electrical imaging technique in imaging
   bi-atrial activation sequences from body surface potential maps (BSPMs).
   Methods
   The study includes 7 subjects, with 3 atrial flutter patients, and 4
   healthy subjects with normal atrial activations. The subject-specific
   heart-torso geometries were obtained from MRI/ CT images. The equivalent
   current densities were reconstructed from 208-channel BSPMs by solving
   the inverse problem using individual heart-torso geometry models. The
   activation times were estimated from the time instant corresponding to
   the highest peak in the time course of the equivalent current densities.
   To evaluate the performance, a total of 32 cycles of atrial flutter were
   analyzed. The imaged activation maps obtained from single beats were
   compared with the average maps and the activation maps measured from
   CARTO, by using correlation coefficient (CC) and relative error (RE).
   Results
   The cardiac electrical imaging technique is capable of imaging both
   focal and reentrant activations. The imaged activation maps for normal
   atrial activations are consistent with findings from isolated human
   hearts. Activation maps for isthmus-dependent counterclockwise reentry
   were reconstructed on three patients with typical atrial flutter. The
   method was capable of imaging macro counterclockwise reentrant loop in
   the right atrium and showed inter-atria electrical conduction through
   coronary sinus. The imaged activation sequences obtained from single
   beats showed good correlation with both the average activation maps (CC
   = 0.91 +/- 0.03, RE = 0.29 +/- 0.05) and the clinical endocardial
   findings using CARTO (CC = 0.70 +/- 0.04, RE = 0.42 +/- 0.05).
   Conclusions
   The noninvasive cardiac electrical imaging technique is able to
   reconstruct complex atrial reentrant activations and focal activation
   patterns in good consistency with clinical electrophysiological mapping.
   It offers the potential to assist in radio-frequency ablation of atrial
   arrhythmia and help defining the underlying arrhythmic mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{We describe here three alkynyl substituted naphthalenes that display
   promising luminescence characteristics. Each compound is easily and
   efficiently synthesized in three steps by capitalizing on the
   hexadehydro-Diels Alder (HDDA) cycloisomerization reaction in which an
   intermediate benzyne is captured by tetraphenylcyclopentadienone, a
   classical trap for benzyne itself. These compounds luminesce in the deep
   blue when stimulated either optically (i.e., photoluminescence in both
   solution and solid films) or electrically {[}in a light-emitting diode
   (LED)]. The photophysical properties are relatively insensitive to the
   electronic nature of the substituents (H, OMe, CO2Me) that define these
   otherwise identical compounds. Overall, our observations suggest that
   the twisted nature of the five adjacent aryl groups serves to minimize
   the intermolecular interaction between core naphthalene units in
   different sample morphologies. These compounds represent promising leads
   for the identification of others of value as the emissive component of
   organic LEDs (OLEDs).}},

Abstract = {{Sphingobium sp. SYK-6 is a soil bacterium boasting a well-studied
   ligninolytic pathway and the potential for development into a microbial
   chassis for lignin valorization. An improved understanding of its
   metabolism will help researchers in the engineering of SYK-6 for the
   production of value-added chemicals through lignin valorization. We used
   C-13-fingerprinting, C-13 metabolic flux analysis (C-13-MFA), and
   RNA-sequencing differential expression analysis to uncover the following
   metabolic traits: (i) SYK-6 prefers alkaline conditions, making it an
   efficient host for the consolidated bioprocessing of lignin, and it also
   lacks the ability to metabolize sugars or organic acids; (ii) the CO2
   release (i. e., carbon loss) from the ligninolysis-based metabolism of
   SYK-6 is significantly greater than the CO2 release from the
   sugar-basedmetabolism of Escherichia coli; (iii) the vanillin catabolic
   pathway (which is the converging point of majority of the lignin
   catabolic pathways) is coupled with the tetrahydrofolate-dependent C1
   pathway that is essential for the biosynthesis of serine, histidine, and
   methionine; (iv) catabolic end products of lignin (pyruvate and
   oxaloacetate) must enter the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle first and
   then use phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase to initiate gluconeogenesis;
   and (v) C-13-MFA together with RNA-sequencing differential expression
   analysis establishes the vanillin catabolic pathway as the major
   contributor of NAD(P) H synthesis. Therefore, the vanillin catabolic
   pathway is essential for SYK-6 to obtain sufficient reducing equivalents
   for its healthy growth; cosubstrate experiments support this finding.
   This unique energy feature of SYK-6 is particularly interesting because
   most heterotrophs rely on the transhydrogenase, the TCA cycle, and the

Abstract = {{A comprehensive understanding of molecular transport within nanoporous
   materials remains elusive in a broad variety of engineering and
   biomedical applications. Here, experiments and atomistic simulations are
   synergically used to elucidate the non-trivial interplay between
   nanopore hydrophilicity and surface barriers on the overall water
   transport through zeolite crystals. At these nanometre-length scales,
   these results highlight the dominating effect of surface imperfections
   with reduced permeability on the overall water transport. A simple
   diffusion resistance model is shown to be sufficient to capture the
   effects of both intracrystalline and surface diffusion resistances, thus
   properly linking simulation to experimental evidence. This work suggests
   that future experimental work should focus on eliminating/overcoming
   these surface imperfections, which promise an order of magnitude
   improvement in permeability.}},

Abstract = {{The time-varying flow is studied experimentally in an anatomically
   accurate model of the human airways from the mouth through several
   generations of bronchial branching. The airway geometry is obtained from
   the CT scan of a healthy adult male of normal height and build. The
   three-component, three-dimensional mean velocity field is obtained
   throughout the entire model using phase-locked Magnetic Resonance
   Velocimetry. A pulsatile pump drives a sinusoidal waveform (inhalation
   and exhalation) with frequency and stroke-length such that the mean
   trachea Reynolds number at peak inspiration is 4200 and the Womersley
   number is 7. Integral parameters are defined to quantify the degree of
   velocity profile non-uniformity (related to axial dispersion) and
   secondary flow strength (lateral dispersion). It is found that the
   extrathoracic airways significantly modify the tracheal flow and that
   the flow at the first bifurcation is highly asymmetric. The effect of
   flow oscillation is to produce time dependent flow features which are
   asymmetric with respect to the acceleration and deceleration periods
   surrounding peak inhalation and exhalation. This is most pronounced in
   regions of separation and on the secondary flow structure, which are
   sensitive to local attributes of the real anatomy. This is reflected in
   the integral parameters, which behave non-monotonically between
   successive bronchial generations. In general, the measured oscillatory
   flow in a realistic anatomy confirms many trends derived from idealized
   models but also possesses qualitatively different large scale flow
   structures as compared to idealized representations of the upper
   airways. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Fatal traumatic brain injury with electrical weapon falls}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FORENSIC AND LEGAL MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{12-19}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: While generally reducing morbidity and mortality,
   electrical weapons have risks associated with their usage, including eye
   injuries and falls. With sufficient probe spread, an uncontrolled fall
   to the ground typically occurs along with the possibility of a fatal
   brain injury.
   Methods: We analyzed possible risk factors including running and
   elevated surfaces with established head-injury criteria to estimate the
   risk of brain injury. We searched for cases of arrest-related or
   incustody death, with TASER (R) electrical weapon usage where
   fall-induced injuries might have contributed to the death. We found 24
   cases meeting our initial inclusion criteria of a fatal fall involving
   electronic control. We then excluded 5 cases as intentional jumps,
   leaving 19 cases of forced falls. Autopsy reports and other records were
   analyzed to determine which of these deaths were from brain injury
   caused by the fall.
   Results: We found 16 probable cases of fatal brain injuries induced by
   electronic control from electrical weapons. Out of 3 million field uses,
   this gives a risk of 5.3 +/- 2.6 PPM which is higher than the
   theoretical risk of electrocution. The mean age was 46 +/- 14 years
   which is significantly greater that the age of the typical ARD (36 +/-
   10). Probe shots to the subject's back may present a higher risk of a
   fatal fall.
   Conclusions: The use of electronic control presents a small but real
   risk of death from fatal traumatic brain injury. Increased age
   represents an independent risk factor for such fatalities. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We report a label-free method to quantify protein levels using a
   combination of printed electronic and microfluidic technologies. The
   protein, in this case, ricin, is captured by a floating electrode
   functionalized with a DNA aptamer. The binding is transduced into an
   amplified potentiometric signal by a printed, electrolyte-gated
   transistor (EGT). Microfluidic channels physically separate the active
   sensor surface from the EGT-transducer, permitting the capture of ricin
   down to 30 pM (1 ng/mL) in buffer and 300 pM (10 ng/mL) in orange juice
   and milk in the absence of preconcentration. The assay is flow-based,
   leading to measurement in minutes since no preprocessing, enzymatic
   reaction, or rinsing steps are needed. Its easy fabrication,
   multiplexability, simple operation, and facile analysis, combined with
   rapid quantitation at clinically relevant levels, make this strategy a
   promising approach to parallelized monitoring of toxin levels in food

Abstract = {{We propose coordination mechanisms for multiple heterogeneous physical
   agents that operate in city-scale disaster scenarios, where they need to
   find and rescue people and extinguish fires. Large-scale disasters are
   characterized by limited and unreliable communications; dangerous events
   that may disable agents; uncertainty about the location, duration, and
   type of tasks; and stringent temporal constraints on task completion
   times. In our approach, agents form teams with other agents that are in
   the same geographical area. Our algorithms either yield stable teams
   formed up front and never change, fluid teams where agents can change
   teams as need arises, or teams that restrict the types of agents that
   can belong to the same team. We compare our teaming algorithms against a
   baseline algorithm in which agents operate independently of others and
   two state-of-the-art coordination mechanisms. Our algorithms are tested
   in city-scale disaster simulations using the RoboCup Rescue simulator.
   Our experiments with different city maps show that, in general, forming
   teams leads to increased task completion and, specifically, that our
   teaming method that restricts the types of agents in a team outperforms
   the other methods. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   engineering of heart valves requires a thorough understanding of the
   different types of cells that can be used to obtain the essential
   phenotypes that are expressed in native heart valves. This article
   reviews different cell types that have been used in heart valve
   engineering, cell sources for harvesting, phenotypic expression in
   constructs and suitability in heart valve tissue engineering. Natural
   and synthetic biomaterials that have been applied as scaffold systems or
   cell-delivery platforms are discussed with each cell type. Copyright (C)

Title = {{Optimized Treatment Schedules for Chronic Myeloid Leukemia}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade, several targeted therapies (e.g. imatinib,
   dasatinib, nilotinib) have been developed to treat Chronic Myeloid
   Leukemia (CML). Despite an initial response to therapy, drug resistance
   remains a problem for some CML patients. Recent studies have shown that
   resistance mutations that preexist treatment can be detected in a
   substantial number of patients, and that this may be associated with
   eventual treatment failure. One proposed method to extend treatment
   efficacy is to use a combination of multiple targeted therapies.
   However, the design of such combination therapies (timing, sequence,
   etc.) remains an open challenge. In this work we mathematically model
   the dynamics of CML response to combination therapy and analyze the
   impact of combination treatment schedules on treatment efficacy in
   patients with preexisting resistance. We then propose an optimization
   problem to find the best schedule of multiple therapies based on the
   evolution of CML according to our ordinary differential equation model.
   This resulting optimization problem is nontrivial due to the presence of
   ordinary different equation constraints and integer variables. Our model
   also incorporates drug toxicity constraints by tracking the dynamics of
   patient neutrophil counts in response to therapy. We determine optimal
   combination strategies that maximize time until treatment failure on
   hypothetical patients, using parameters estimated from clinical data in
   the literature.}},

Title = {{Effect of alkaline and high-pressure homogenization on the extraction of
   phenolic acids from potato peels}},
Journal = {{INNOVATIVE FOOD SCIENCE \& EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{A}},
Pages = {{91-97}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Phenolic acids were extracted from potato peels with NaOH treatment and
   a high-pressure homogenization (HPH) process. Total phenolic content,
   total flavonoid content, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical
   scavenging capacity and extraction yield were determined with different
   treatment conditions. Significant improvement was observed after the
   alkaline and HPH treatments. HPLC analysis shows that the phenolic
   compounds contained gallic acid, sinapic acid, vanillic acid, syringic
   acid, protocatechuic acid, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, caffeic
   acid and ferulic acid. The yields of these specific phenolic acids
   varied with different treatments. Scanning electron microscope, nuclear
   magnetic resonance and particle size measurements suggest that changes
   in cellular structure may be the mechanisms for the improvement in
   extraction rendered by the HPH and NaOH treatments. In conclusion, the
   combined treatment of NaOH and HPH increased the extraction yield and
   functionality of the phenolic acids from the potato peel residues.
   Industry relevance: High-pressure homogenization as a process method has
   been applied widely in food industry. It can help with emulsification
   and sterilization significantly. But the potential of High-pressure
   homogenization as an assist method to improve the yield of extraction
   from food and food waste has not been developed. The positive effect of
   phenolic and flavonoids has been proved and found in potato peels.
   However, the release of these bioactive components is a difficulty with
   traditional method. The High-pressure homogenization can reduce the
   particle size apparently and release the bioactive compound. For potato
   peels, the production can be added into bread, meat, beverage, etc. to
   increase the fiber and nutrition. For other sorts of similar material,
   the high-pressure homogenization can be a novel to improve the
   extraction process of bioactive component bound in cell wall instead of
   inside the cell. In this article, we developed a new method with
   high-pressure homogenization and alkaline treatment to improve the
   extraction process dramatically. Meanwhile, the process can be scale up
   to industry with minor modification and adjustment. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{The social costs of nitrogen}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Despite growing recognition of the negative externalities associated
   with reactive nitrogen (N), the damage costs of N to air, water, and
   climate remain largely unquantified. We propose a comprehensive approach
   for estimating the social cost of nitrogen (SCN), defined as the present
   value of the monetary damages caused by an incremental increase in N.
   This framework advances N accounting by considering how each form of N
   causes damages at specific locations as it cascades through the
   environment. We apply the approach to an empirical example that
   estimates the SCN for N applied as fertilizer. We track impacts of N
   through its transformation into atmospheric and aquatic pools and
   estimate the distribution of associated costs to affected populations.
   Our results confirm that there is no uniform SCN. Instead, changes in N
   management will result in different N-related costs depending on where N
   moves and the location, vulnerability, and preferences of populations
   affected by N. For example, we found that the SCN per kilogram of N
   fertilizer applied in Minnesota ranges over several orders of magnitude,
   from less than \$0.001/kg N to greater than \$10/kg N, illustrating the
   importance of considering the site, the form of N, and end points of
   interest rather than assuming a uniform cost for damages. Our approach
   for estimating the SCN demonstrates the potential of integrated
   biophysical and economic models to illuminate the costs and benefits of
   N and inform more strategic and efficient N management.}},

Abstract = {{Between 1955 and 1960, theories about lignin configuration were
   vacillating between random-coil and cross-linked ``microger
   representations for macromolecular lignin chains. Light scattering was
   important in these early studies, but it was difficult to deal
   adequately with lignin fluorescence at the 546 nm incident wavelength
   being used. Cross-linking then prevailed, largely because of the
   hydrodynamic compactness of high molecular weight lignin species. The
   conceptual ramifications of this paradigm led to 40 wt \% incorporation
   limits (or less) for lignins in cohesive polymeric materials. In due
   course, however, further evidence for a random-coil description of
   individual lignin components materialized; it became less obvious why
   simple lignin derivatives could not, on their own, form promising
   polymeric materials. The first plastics composed solely of a (native)
   ball-milled softwood lignin are similar to polyethylene in tensile
   behavior. Blending with just 5 wt \% tetrabromobisphenol A (a flame
   retardant) results in a material that surpasses polystyrene decisively.
   Prior methylation of the ball-milled lignin produces markedly better
   results, with and without small quantities of blend components. Even
   quite challenging lignin derivatives like the (polyanionic) sulfonates
   perform auspiciously in formulations with particular aliphatic
   polyesters. The macromolecular species in polymeric materials with very
   high lignin-derivative contents are associated lignin complexes rather
   than individual lignin macromolecules. The interactions of blend
   components with these complexes are instrumental in determining the
   mechanical properties of contemporary lignin-based plastics.}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe anatomical substrate for the mid-mural ventricular
   hyperechogenic zone remains uncertain, but it may represent no more than
   ultrasound reflected from cardiomyocytes orientated orthogonally to the
   ultrasonic beam. We sought to ascertain the relationship between the
   echogenic zone and the orientation of the cardiomyocytes.
   MethodsWe used 3D echocardiography, diffusion tensor imaging, and
   microcomputed tomography to analyze the location and orientation of
   cardiomyocytes within the echogenic zone.
   ResultsWe demonstrated that visualization of the echogenic zone is
   dependent on the position of the transducer and is most clearly seen
   from the apical window. Diffusion tensor imaging and microcomputed
   tomography show that the echogenic zone seen from the apical window
   corresponds to the position of the circumferentially orientated
   cardiomyocytes. An oblique band seen in the parasternal view relates to
   cardiomyocytes orientated orthogonally to the ultrasonic beam.
   ConclusionsThe mid-mural ventricular hyperechogenic zone represents
   reflected ultrasound from cardiomyocytes aligned orthogonal to the
   ultrasonic beam. The echogenic zone does not represent a space, a
   connective tissue sheet, a boundary between ascending and descending
   limbs of a hypothetical helical ventricular myocardial band, nor an
   abrupt change in cardiomyocyte orientation.}},

Title = {{Do wetlands enhance downstream denitrification in agricultural
   landscapes?}},
Journal = {{ECOSPHERE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Wetlands are known to be effective sinks for nitrate. Wetland
   restoration and construction have gained traction as viable conservation
   measures to improve water quality in intensively managed agricultural
   landscapes. In addition to reducing nitrate in situ, wetlands may have
   impacts on water chemistry and temperature dynamics that extend beyond
   the confines of the wetlands themselves. Nonsaturating nitrate
   concentrations (NO3-), enhanced organic carbon effluxes, and altered
   temperature dynamics in streams downstream of wetlands could all affect
   denitrification rates within a stream network, potentially extending
   water quality benefits beyond wetland boundaries. We investigated the
   effect of wetlands on water chemistry, water temperature, and benthic
   denitrification rates in downstream agricultural ditches through a field
   measurement campaign over the open water season. We found that although
   ditches located downstream of wetlands had lower NO3- and higher DOC,
   ditch denitrification rate was not significantly altered by the presence
   of upstream wetlands. Rather, wetlands indirectly affected
   denitrification within ditches by strongly influencing the stoichiometry
   of the two limiting resources, NO3 and organic carbon. Peak
   denitrification rates in ditches were observed when DOC and NO3-
   supplies were approximately balanced, that is, at DOC: NO3- ratios that
   were near the microbial requirement for denitrification. NO3- limitation
   occurred primarily at sites with > 3\% wetland cover, and in the fall
   season at all sites, and DOC limitation occurred primarily at sites with
   < 1\% wetland cover. Temperature was found to be a secondary control
   that was important only when NO3- and DOC availabilities were balanced.
   Our results suggest that wetland restoration and construction targeting
   nitrate reduction within intensively agriculturally managed basins
   should be implemented in a way that promotes balanced resource
   availability throughout fluvial networks. Wetlands are an important
   regulator of resource availability and thus could be used to create
   conditions that maximize denitrification in NO3- enriched watersheds.}},

Abstract = {{Patch clamp is the main technique for measuring electrical properties of
   individual cells. Since its discovery in 1976 by Neher and Sakmann,
   patch clamp has been instrumental in broadening our understanding of the
   fundamental properties of ion channels and synapses in neurons. The
   conventional patch-clamp method requires manual, precise positioning of
   a glass micropipette against the cell membrane of a visually identified
   target neuron. Subsequently, a tight ``gigaseal{''} connection between
   the pipette and the cell membrane is established, and suction is applied
   to establish the whole cell patch configuration to perform
   electrophysiological recordings. This procedure is repeated manually for
   each individual cell, making it labor intensive and time consuming. In
   this article we describe the development of a new automatic patch-clamp
   system for brain slices, which integrates all steps of the patch-clamp
   process: image acquisition through a microscope, computer vision-based
   identification of a patch pipette and fluorescently labeled neurons,
   micromanipulator control, and automated patching. We validated our
   system in brain slices from wild-type and transgenic mice expressing
   channelrhodopsin 2 under the Thy1 promoter (line 18) or injected with a
   herpes simplex virus-expressing archaerhodopsin, ArchT. Our computer
   vision-based algorithm makes the fluorescent cell detection and
   targeting user independent. Compared with manual patching, our system is
   superior in both success rate and average trial duration. It provides
   more reliable trial-to-trial control of the patching process and
   improves reproducibility of experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription factors (TFs) play a central role in controlling
   spatiotemporal gene expression and the response to environmental cues. A
   comprehensive understanding of gene regulation requires integrating
   physical protein-DNA interactions (PDIs) with TF regulatory activity,
   expression patterns, and phenotypic data. Although great progress has
   been made in mapping PDIs using chromatin immunoprecipitation, these
   studies have only characterized 10\% of TFs in any metazoan species. The
   nematode C.elegans has been widely used to study gene regulation due to
   its compact genome with short regulatory sequences. Here, we delineated
   the largest gene-centered metazoan PDI network to date by examining
   interactions between 90\% of C. elegans TFs and 15\% of gene promoters.
   We used this network as a backbone to predict TF binding sites for 77
   TFs, two-thirds of which are novel, as well as integrate gene
   expression, protein-protein interaction, and phenotypic data to predict
   regulatory and biological functions for multiple genes and TFs.}},

Abstract = {{Luminescence nanothermometry is nowadays a highly-dynamic research topic
   that is being driven by the challenging demands arising from dissimilar
   areas such as microelectronics, microfluidics and nanomedicine. Although
   the technique is rapidly evolving from the initial breakthrough to real
   applications, there are still major challenges regarding the
   conciliation of nanometric probes with the high sensitivity and
   predictability of the thermal response of the system. In the past five
   years, luminescent thermometers operating at the nanoscale, where the
   conventional methods are ineffective, have emerged as a very active
   field of research. Luminescent silicon nanoparticles (SiNPs) are a
   promising choice for nanothermometry, combining the Si biocompatibility
   with the compatibility with the current microelectronic technology.
   Here, the thermal dependence of the emission peak position of SiNPs,
   used as the thermometric parameter, is well-described by the Varshni's
   law, enabling the development of a self-calibrated nanothermometer with
   a calibration curve predicted by a well-stablished state equation,
   avoiding new calibration procedures whenever the thermometer operates in
   different media. For the first time, temperature sensing using
   SiNPs-based luminescent thermometers in different media without the need
   of new calibration procedures is demonstrated. The thermometer reveals
   reversibility and repeatability higher than 99.98\%, and a maximum
   relative sensitivity of 0.04\% K-1.}},

Abstract = {{Simulations demonstrate that undoped yttrium iron garnet (YIG)
   seedlayers cause reduced Faraday rotation in silicon-on-insulator
   waveguides with Ce-doped YIG claddings. Undoped seedlayers are required
   for the crystallization of the magneto-optical Ce:YIG claddings, but
   they diminish the interaction of the Ce:YIG with the guided modes.
   Therefore, new magneto-optical garnets, terbium iron garnet (TIG) and
   bismuth-doped TIG (Bi:TIG), are introduced that can be integrated
   directly on Si and quartz substrates without seedlayers. The Faraday
   rotations of TIG and Bi:TIG films at 1550 nm were measured to be +500
   degrees/cm and -500 degrees/cm, respectively. Simulations show that
   these new garnets have the potential to significantly mitigate the
   negative impact of the seedlayers under Ce:YIG claddings. The successful
   growth of TIG and Bi:TIG on low-index fused quartz inspired novel
   garnet-core waveguide isolator designs, simulated using finite
   difference time domain methods. These designs use alternating segments
   of positive and negative Faraday rotation for push-pull quasi phase
   matching in order to overcome birefringence in waveguides with
   rectangular cross sections.}},

Abstract = {{Cancerous tissues have electrical-conductivity signatures different from
   normal tissues, which contain potentially useful information for early
   detection. Despite recent advancements in electrical-conductivity
   imaging and its applications, imaging electrical conductivities with
   high spatial resolution remains a challenge for non-invasive diagnosis
   of early-stage cancer. Among the various electrical-conductivity imaging
   methods, magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is
   a promising technology for non-invasive detection of breast cancer.
   However, previous efforts to use MAT-MI for cancer imaging have suffered
   due to insufficient spatial resolution. In this work, we have developed
   a high-frequency MAT-MI (hfMAT-MI) system with a 2-D spatial resolution

   we demonstrated the performance of this method using an in vivo cancer
   model in nude mice with human breast xenograft hindlimb tumors. hfMAT-MI
   was able to resolve not only the boundaries between cancerous and
   healthy tissues, but also the tumors' internal structures. Importantly,
   we were able to track a growing tumor using our hfMAT-MI method for the
   first time in an in vivo mouse model, demonstrating the promise of this

Title = {{Mechanically Tunable, Readily Processable Ion Gels by Self-Assembly of
   Block Copolymers in Ionic Liquids}},
Journal = {{ACCOUNTS OF CHEMICAL RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Room temperature ionic liquids are of great interest for many advanced
   applications, due to the combination of attractive physical properties
   with essentially unlimited tunability of chemical structure. High
   chemical and thermal stability, favorable ionic conductivity, and
   complete nonvolatility are just some of the most important physical
   characteristics that make ionic liquids promising candidates for
   emerging technologies. Examples include separation membranes, actuators,
   polymer gel electrolytes, supercapacitors, ion batteries, fuel cell
   membranes, sensors, printable plastic electronics, and flexible
   displays. However, in these and other applications, it is essential to
   solidify the ionic liquid, while retaining the liquid state properties
   of interest. A broadly applicable solidification strategy relies on
   gelation by addition of suitable triblock copolymers with the ABA
   architecture, producing ion gels or ionogels. In this paradigm, the A
   end blocks are immiscible with the ionic liquid, and consequently self
   assemble into micellar cores, while some fraction of the well-solvated B
   midblocks bridge between micelles, forming a percolating network. The
   chemical structures of the A and B repeat units, the molar mass of the
   blocks, and the concentration of the copolymer in the ionic liquid are
   all independently tunable to attain desired property combinations. In
   particular, the modulus of the resulting ion gel can be readily varied
   between 100 Pa and 1 MPa, with little sacrifice of the transport
   properties of the ionic liquid, such as ionic conductivity or gas
   diffusivity. Suitable A blocks can impart thermoreversible gelation
   (with solidification either on heating or cooling) or even
   photoreversible gelation.
   By virtue of the nonvolatility of ionic liquids, a wide range of
   processing strategies can be employed directly to prepare ion gels in
   thin or thick film forms, including solvent casting, spin coating,
   aerosol jet printing, photopatterning, and transfer printing. For higher
   modulus ion gels it is even possible to employ a manual ``cut and
   stick{''} strategy for easy device fabrication. Ion gels prepared from
   common triblock copolymers, for example, with A = polystyrene and B =
   poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(methyl methacrylate), in imidazolium based
   ionic liquids provide exceptional{''} performance in membranes for
   separating CO2 from N2 or CH4. The same materials also are the best
   available gate dielectrics for printed plastic electronics, because
   their high capacitance endows organic transistors with milliamp output
   currents for sub-1 V applied bias, with switching speeds that can go
   well beyond 100 kHz, while being amenable to large area roll-to-roll
   printing. Incorporation of well-designed electroluminescent (e.g.,
   Ru(bpy)3-based) or electrochromic (e.g., viologen-based) moieties into
   ion gels held between transparent electrodes yields flexible color
   displays operating with sub-1 V dc inputs.}},

Title = {{Assessing uncertainty in the profitability of prairie biomass production

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Compensation for ecosystem services can encourage the management of
   agricultural systems for a broad range of benefits beyond crop
   production. Here we explore how payments for carbon sequestration and
   phosphorus retention affect the profitability and economic
   competitiveness of perennial herbaceous biomass. We consider the case of
   converting marginal land currently in corn and soy production in
   southern Minnesota, United States, to native diverse prairie grown as a
   biofuel feedstock. We estimate the resulting changes in soil carbon
   storage and water quality, and the economic value of both. To test the
   robustness of our results, we perform Monte Carlo simulations that
   incorporate variability and uncertainty in our model parameters. Our
   analyses show that prairie biomass production on marginal lands is 22\%
   likely to be profitable when ecosystem service compensation is included,
   but only 5\% when it is not. This suggests that the two ecosystem
   services modeled here may alone be insufficient to make prairie biomass
   production reliably profitable. Furthermore, by using ranges of model
   parameters rather than point estimates, this study shows that the
   profitability gap between conventional row crops and prairie is too
   large to be closed with the two services modeled here across a range of
   recent economic conditions. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recent work has indicated the presence of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) in
   laboratory diesel and gasoline exhaust, in ambient air, and in lung
   samples of children exposed to traffic exhaust. While it is already
   known that certain processes will produce some carbonaceous particles of
   fullerene-like crystallinity, the conditions responsible for their
   formation remain unknown. On the basis of a standard process for the gas
   -phase synthesis of CNTs, we hypothesized that the presence of a metal
   catalyst precursor and high levels of fuel sulfur would impact CNT
   formation in a diesel engine. A diesel engine was doped with varying
   concentrations of fuel-borne sulfur and ferrocene to produce conditioned
   iron (Fe) particles that acted as seed catalysts. Results showed that in
   the presence of Fe nuclei resulting from 36 ppm ferrocene doping, 4500
   ppm of fuel sulfur produced CNT-like structures in 31\% of images
   analyzed by transmission electron microscopy. The precursor
   concentrations required for high rates of CNT growth are comparable to
   those found in transportation fuels used in many regions of the world.
   These findings substantiate studies that indicate a global presence of
   CNT-like particles in ambient air. Formation of these structures is less
   likely with low-sulfur fuels, and the structures are effectively removed
   by particulate filters.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate nanogap electrodes for rapid, parallel, and
   ultralow-power trapping of nanoparticles. Our device pushes the limit of
   dielectrophoresis by shrinking the separation between gold electrodes to
   sub-10 nm, thereby creating strong trapping forces at biases as low as
   the 100 mV ranges. Using high-throughput atomic layer lithography; we
   manufacture sub-10 nm gaps between 0.8 mm long gold electrodes and
   pattern them into individually addressable parallel electronic traps.
   Unlike pointlike junctions made by electron-beam lithography or larger
   micron-gap electrodes that are used for conventional dielectrophoresis,
   our sub-10 nm gold nanogap electrodes provide strong trapping forces
   over a mm-scale trapping zone. Importantly, our technology solves the
   key challenges associated with traditional dielectrophoresis
   experiments, such as high voltages that cause heat generation, bubble
   formation, and unwanted electrochemical reactions. The strongly enhanced
   fields around the nanogap induce particle transport speed exceeding 10
   mu m/s and enable the trapping of 30 nm polystyrene nanoparticles using
   an ultralow bias of 200 mV. We also demonstrate rapid electronic
   trapping of quantum dots and nanodiamond particles on arrays of parallel
   traps. Our sub 10 nm gold nanogap electrodes can be combined with
   plasmonic sensors or nanophotonic circuitry, and their low-power
   electronic operation can potentially enable high-density integration on
   a chip as well as portable biosensing.}},

   COx and acrylic acid to acetaldehyde and ethylene. A kinetic model is
   developed to quantitatively capture the kinetic behavior of all species
   using pseudo-first-order rate expressions in the organic reactant for
   all reaction pathways; additional promotional and inhibitory
   dependencies on water pressure were added to describe the kinetics of
   reaction rates affected by water. Based on the proposition that multiple
   types of active sites exist on the mixed metal oxide surface during
   propylene oxidation, a detailed mechanistic network is postulated that
   describes all molecular transformations with relevant surface
   intermediates and provides critical insights into the underlying
   pathways involved in overoxidation and C-C bond scission reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue-equivalents (TEs), simple model tissues with tunable properties,
   have been used to explore many features of biological soft tissues.
   Absent in most formulations however, is the residual stress that arises
   due to interactions among components with different unloaded levels of
   stress, which has an important functional role in many biological
   tissues. To create a pre-stressed model system, co-gels were fabricated
   from a combination of hyaluronic acid (HA) and reconstituted Type-I
   collagen (Col). When placed in solutions of varying osmolarity, HA-Col
   co-gels swell as the HA imbibes water, which in turn stretches (and
   stresses) the collagen network. In this way, co-gels with residual
   stress (i.e., collagen fibers in tension and HA in compression) were
   fabricated. When the three gel types tested here were immersed in
   hypotonic solutions, pure HA gels swelled the most, followed by HA-Col
   co-gels; no swelling was observed in pure collagen gels. The greatest
   swelling rates and swelling ratios occurred in the lowest salt
   concentration solutions. Tension on the collagen component of HA-Col
   co-gels was calculated from a stress balance and increased nonlinearly
   as swelling increased. The swelling experiment results were in good
   agreement with the stress predicted by a fibril network + non-fibrillar
   interstitial matrix computational model.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a novel flocculation strategy for harvesting Chlorella
   vulgaris with combined flocculants, poly (gamma-glutamic acid)
   (gamma-PGA) and calcium oxide (CaO), has been developed. The effect of
   flocculant dosage, the order of flocculant addition, mixing speed, and
   growth stage on the harvesting efficiency was evaluated. Results showed
   that the flocculation using combined flocculants significantly decreases
   the flocculant dosage and settling time compared with control. It was
   also found that CaO and gamma-PGA influenced microalgal flocculation by
   changing the zeta potential of cells and pH of microalgal suspension.
   The most suitable order of flocculant addition was CaO first and then
   gamma-PGA. The optimal mixing speed was 200 rpm for 0.5 min, followed by
   50 rpm for another 4.5 min for CaO and gamma-PGA with the highest
   flocculation efficiency of 95 \% and a concentration factor of 35.5. The
   biomass concentration and lipid yield of the culture reusing the
   flocculated medium were similar to those when a fresh medium was used.
   Overall, the proposed method requires low energy input, alleviates
   biomass and water contamination, and reduces utilization of water
   resources and is feasible for harvesting C. vulgaris for biofuel and
   other bio-based chemical production.}},

Abstract = {{A coupler is an indispensable component to sample the forward and

   with a tunable high directivity circuit to accurately measure the
   reflected RF power. The directivity tuner composed of passive components
   adjusts the phase and amplitude of the coupled RF signal, and cancels
   out the leakage signal from the RF input port at the coupled reflection
   port. The experimental results, which agree with the simulation results,
   show that the microstrip coupler with the directivity tuner circuit has
   a compact size (similar to 0.07 lambda(g) x 0.05 lambda(g)), high power
   capability (up to 1 kW), and high directivities (more than 40 dB) at the

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the efficiency of arsenate removal at low initial arsenic (As)
   concentrations is a new challenge following the new maximum contaminant
   level (MCL) of As in drinking water, revised downward from 50 to 10g/L
   by the U.S. EPA. Many water systems across the United States are
   required to remove As from drinking water under the current regulations.
   However, most of the models used to predict As removal performance were
   developed and validated based on the old, higher concentration standard.
   This paper investigates and reports on the ability of a model, based on
   the diffuse double-layer (DDL) surface complexation model, to predict As
   removal for low As levels (10-20g/L). The model was validated with a
   pilot study using source water from Well No. 3 of the Mutual Domestic
   Water Consumers Association (MDWCA) in Anthony, New Mexico. Based on the
   comparison of experimental data with model results, the model presented
   here can successfully predict the efficiency of As removal by
   coprecipitation with iron (hydr)oxide when initial As concentration,
   total iron concentration, and pH are known. The average discrepancy
   between experimental data and predicted results ranged from 3 to 12\%,

Abstract = {{A local error method based on an analytical scheme previously developed
   for the scalar optical fiber channel is applied to the second-order
   symmetrized split-step Fourier simulation of polarization multiplexed
   signal propagation through dispersion compensated optical fiber links.
   It is found that the global simulation accuracy for the vector
   propagation can be satisfied using the local error bound from a scalar
   propagation model for the same global error over a large range of
   simulation accuracy, chromatic dispersion, and differential group delay.
   Furthermore, carefully designed numerical simulations are used to show
   that similar local simulation error are obtained for vector simulations
   and that the similar local error leads to higher computational
   efficiency compared to other prevalent step-size selection schemes. The
   scaling of the global simulation error with respect to the number of
   optical fiber spans is demonstrated, and global error control for
   multi-span simulations is proposed. Combining the local error and global
   error control, the developed simulation scheme can significantly speed

Abstract = {{BackgroundClostridium difficile infection (CDI) may not respond to

   AimTo assess microbial signatures as predictors of treatment response
   and recurrence in CDI.
   MethodsPre-treatment stool samples and clinical metadata including
   outcomes were collected prospectively from patients with their first CDI
   episode. Next generation 16s rRNA sequencing using MiSeq Illumina
   platform was performed and changes in microbial community structure were
   correlated with CDI outcomes.
   ResultsEighty-eight patients (median age 52.7 years, 60.2\% female) were

   response in 28.5\%. Patients who responded to treatment had an increase

   Faecalibacterium and Rothia compared to nonresponders. A risk-index
   built from this panel of microbes differentiated responders (mean 0.07
   0.24) from nonresponders (0.52 +/- 0.42; P = 0.0002). Receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve demonstrated that risk-index was a strong
   predictor of treatment response with an area under the curve (AUC) of
   0.85. Among clinical parameters tested, only proton pump inhibitor use
   predicted recurrent CDI (OR 3.75, 95\% CI 1.27-11.1, P = 0.01). Patients
   with recurrent CDI had statistically significant increases in
   Veillonella, Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococci, Parabacteroides and
   Lachnospiraceae compared to patients without recurrence and a risk index
   was able to predict recurrence (AUC = 0.78).
   ConclusionGut microbiota signatures predict treatment response and
   recurrence potentially, allowing identification of patients with
   Clostridium difficile infection that may benefit from early institution
   of alternate therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Managing stormwater under climate uncertainty is a concern in both
   built-out communities and those continuing to undergo land use change.
   In this study, a suite of climate change scenarios were developed to
   represent a probable range of change in the 10-year recurrence interval
   design storm. The Environmental Protection Agency's Stormwater
   Management Model was used to predict flooding due to undersized drainage
   components within watersheds representing a traditional, built-out urban
   area and a developing suburban area with intact green infrastructure
   corridors. Despite undersized infrastructure and flooding in both study
   watersheds, the risk of property damage in the suburban watershed was
   negligible across the range of scenarios even at projected build-out,
   due in part to flood storage capacity of the green infrastructure
   network. Adaptation approaches - including pipe upsizing, underground
   storage, and bioinfiltration - and costs were also modeled in both
   watersheds. In the built-out site, bioinfiltration practices were
   predicted to moderate both flooding and total adaptation costs even when
   implemented over a relatively modest (10 \%) portion of the watershed;
   however, a substantial upgrade to gray stormwater infrastructure (pipes
   and storage chambers) was also needed to mitigate impacts. In the
   urbanizing community, maintaining an intact green infrastructure network
   was surmised to be the most cost-effective approach for enhancing the
   resilience of urban stormwater systems to climate uncertainties and
   urbanization.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL GEOMETRY-THEORY AND APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Pages = {{97-109}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The art gallery problem is a classical sensor placement problem that
   asks for the minimum number of guards required to see every point in an
   environment. The standard formulation does not take into account
   self-occlusions caused by a person or an object within the environment.
   Obtaining good views of an object from all orientations despite self
   occlusions is an important requirement for surveillance and visual
   inspection applications. We study the art gallery problem under a
   constraint, termed Delta-guarding, that ensures that all sides of any
   convex object are always visible in spite of self-occlusion.
   Our contributions in this paper are three-fold: We first prove that
   Omega (root n) guards are always necessary for Delta-guarding the
   interior of a simple polygon having n vertices. Second, we present a
   O(logc(opt)) factor approximation algorithm for Delta-guarding polygons
   with or without holes, when the guards are restricted to vertices of the
   polygon. Here, C-opt is the optimal number of guards. Third, we study
   the problem of Delta-guarding a set of line segments connecting points
   on the boundary of the polygon. This is motivated by applications where
   an object. or person of interest can only move along certain paths in
   the polygon. We present a constant factor approximation algorithm for
   this problem - one of the few such results for art gallery problems. (C)

Abstract = {{Oxidation of methionine disrupts the structure and function of a range
   of proteins, but little is understood about the chemistry that underlies
   these perturbations. Using quantum mechanical calculations, we found
   that oxidation increased the strength of the methionine-aromatic
   interaction motif, a driving force for protein folding and
   protein-protein interaction, by 0.5-1.4 kcal/mol. We found that
   non-hydrogen-bonded interactions between dimethyl sulfoxide (a
   methionine analog) and aromatic groups were enriched in both the Protein
   Data Bank and Cambridge Structural Database. Thermal denaturation and
   NMR spectroscopy experiments on model peptides demonstrated that
   oxidation of methionine stabilized the interaction by 0.5-0.6 kcal/mol.
   We confirmed the biological relevance of these findings through a
   combination of cell biology, electron paramagnetic resonance
   spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations on (i) calmodulin
   structure and dynamics, and (ii) lymphotoxin-a binding to TNFR1. Thus,
   the methionine-aromatic motif was a determinant of protein structural
   and functional sensitivity to oxidative stress.}},

Abstract = {{A common strategy for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from
   energy use is to increase the supply of low-carbon alternatives.
   However, increasing supply tends to lower energy prices, which
   encourages additional fuel consumption. This ``fuel market rebound
   effect{''} can undermine climate change mitigation strategies, even to
   the point where efforts to reduce GHG emissions by increasing the supply
   of low-carbon fuels may actually result in ``increased GHG emissions.
   Here, we explore how policies that encourage the production of
   low-carbon fuels may result in increased GHG emissions because the
   resulting increase in energy use overwhelms the benefits of reduced
   carbon intensity. We describe how climate change mitigation strategies
   should follow a simple rule: a low-carbon fuel with a carbon intensity
   of X\% that of a fossil fuel must displace at least X\% of that fossil
   fuel to reduce overall GHG emissions. We apply this rule to the United
   States Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS2). We show that absent consideration
   of the fuel market rebound effect, RFS2 appears to reduce GHG emissions,
   but once the fuel market rebound effect is factored in, RFS2 actually
   increases GHG emissions when all fuel GHG intensity targets are met. (C)

Abstract = {{The hydraulic power-split architecture, or the hydromechanical
   transmission, can exist in over 1000 configurations. Since a specific
   hydromechanical transmission configuration has a unique kinematic
   characteristic, the optimal hydromechanical transmission configuration
   for one application is different from the optimal hydromechanical
   transmission configurations for other applications. This study finds the
   optimal hydromechanical transmission configuration for a hybrid
   hydraulic city bus. Since a hydromechanical transmission uses at least
   one planetary gear set, the process of finding a suitable
   hydromechanical transmission configuration for a hybrid hydraulic city
   bus is very time consuming, but this study simplifies the procedure by
   utilizing the critical speed ratio (crit), where (crit) is the missing
   link between the planetary gear set configuration, its gear ratio and
   its kinematic characteristic. This simplification also allows complex
   dual-stage hydromechanical transmission architecture configurations to
   be considered as candidates for the optimal drivetrain of the hybrid
   hydraulic city bus. The hydromechanical transmission configuration
   candidates are simulated over three city bus driving cycles and, to
   ensure that they operate at the optimal conditions for each driving
   cycle, dynamic programming is used. This study also establishes two
   power recirculation modes, one of which is useful because of its high
   efficiency. A single-stage power-split architecture configuration
   candidate is found to be the optimal drivetrain for a hydromechanical
   transmission bus.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a general algorithmic framework for constrained matrix and
   tensor factorization, which is widely used in signal processing
   andmachine learning. The new framework is a hybrid between alternating
   optimization (AO) and the alternating direction method of multipliers
   (ADMM): each matrix factor is updated in turn, using ADMM, hence the
   name AO-ADMM. This combination can naturally accommodate a great variety
   of constraints on the factor matrices, and almost all possible loss
   measures for the fitting. Computation caching and warm start strategies
   are used to ensure that each update is evaluated efficiently, while the
   outer AO framework exploits recent developments in block coordinate
   descent (BCD)-type methods which help ensure that every limit point is a
   stationary point, as well as faster and more robust convergence in
   practice. Three special cases are studied in detail: non-negative
   matrix/tensor factorization, constrained matrix/tensor completion, and
   dictionary learning. Extensive simulations and experiments with real
   data are used to showcase the effectiveness and broad applicability of
   the proposed framework.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a consistent MPS (Moving Particle System
   Semi-implicit/Moving Particle System Simulation) method is established
   emanating from Taylor Expansion and Gauss's Theorem. The proposed MPS
   method preserves the consistency between the Gradient and Laplacian
   approximations, and also has the ability to recover the conventional MPS
   method which lacks consistency. In addition, the proposed method
   preserves the first order accuracy in space whereas the traditional MPS
   method loses the accuracy in the case with arbitrary and non-uniform
   particle discretization. The applicability of the proposed method for
   the analysis of first- and second-order transient hyperbolic and
   parabolic systems is illustrated via a recently developed C-F model
   (Cattaneo Fourier model) of heat conduction that has been proven to
   govern thermal transport in different scales, and also capture the
   various heat conduction physical phenomena. The approaches of imposing
   different boundary conditions in the heat conduction problems are
   investigated comprehensively as well. In addition, a unified GS4
   i-Integration framework is exploited in the numerical simulations
   involving first- and second-order systems in time. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Volume = {{69}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used in
   solving structured convex optimization problems due to its superior
   practical performance. On the theoretical side however, a counterexample
   was shown in Chen et al. (Math Program 155(1):57-79, 2016.) indicating
   that the multi-block ADMM for minimizing the sum of N convex functions
   with N block variables linked by linear constraints may diverge. It is
   therefore of great interest to investigate further sufficient conditions
   on the input side which can guarantee convergence for the multi-block
   ADMM. The existing results typically require the strong convexity on
   parts of the objective. In this paper, we provide two different ways
   related to multi-block ADMM that can find an -optimal solution and do
   not require strong convexity of the objective function. Specifically, we
   prove the following two results: (1) the multi-block ADMM returns an
   -optimal solution within iterations by solving an associated
   perturbation to the original problem; this case can be seen as using
   multi-block ADMM to solve a modified problem; (2) the multi-block ADMM
   returns an -optimal solution within iterations when it is applied to
   solve a certain sharing problem, under the condition that the augmented
   Lagrangian function satisfies the Kurdyka-Aojasiewicz property, which
   essentially covers most convex optimization models except for some
   pathological cases; this case can be seen as applying multi-block ADMM
   to solving a special class of problems.}},

   applied to both S-rich and Se-rich Cu2ZnSn (S,Se)(4) (CZTSSe) absorbers
   as an alternative buffer layer to conventional CdS. The device
   performance relationship to the O/(O+S) ratio was examined. The highest

   using an actual O/(O+S) ratio of similar to 0.67 in the buffer layer for
   S-rich and Se-rich CZTSSe solar cells, and these PCE5 correspond to 77\%
   and 67\% of the standard CdS-based solar cells, respectively. Further
   improvement in Se-rich CZTSSe was demonstrated by using NH4OH solution
   instead of pure H2O as oxygen source during ALD process. The dependence

   investigate the effects of nitrogen sufficiency conversion on indigenous
   strain UMN266 for NH+ 4 -N removal. Results showed that mixotrophic
   cultures in the first two stages with N deprivation in Stage 2 was the
   optimum treatment strategy, and higher NH+ 4 -N concentration in Stage 3
   facilitated both microalgal growth and NH+ 4 -N removal, with average
   and maximum biomass productivity of 55.3 and 161.0 mg L-1 d-1, and
   corresponding removal rates of 4.2 and 15.0 mg L-1 d-1, respectively,
   superior to previously published results. Observations of intracellular
   compositions confirmed the optimum treatment strategy, discovering
   excellent starch accumulating property of strain UMN266 as well.
   Combination of bioethanol production with the proposed three-stage
   process using various real wastewater streams at corresponding stages
   was suggested for future application.}},

Title = {{Explicit expressions for the minimum efficiency and most penetrating

Abstract = {{Nuclepore filters are capillary pore membrane filters with an array of
   microscopic cylindrical holes of uniform diameters. Their structure is
   suitable for particle collection and ensuing offline analyses, therefore
   they are being widely used for exposure assessment of engineered
   nanoparticles, ambient PM2.5, virus, bacteria, asbestos, etc., as well
   as in powder manufacturing industries. However, there exists a particle
   size range in which all the filtration capture mechanisms are not
   effective. This size is the most penetrating particle size (MPPS), which
   corresponds to the minimum efficiency (ME) of the filter. Both MPPS and
   ME are important parameters for a user to select an adequate Nuclepore
   filter and preferred operating conditions. For rapid estimation of the
   MPPS and ME, we derived their explicit expressions by simplifying the
   formulas for the impaction, diffusion and interception deposition and
   differentiating the combined efficiency with respect to the particle
   size. The comparison between the experimental data and the prediction
   from the explicit expressions shows the explicit expressions can provide
   MPPS accurately for a wide range of filter properties (pore radius,
   porosity and length) and filtration conditions (particle density, face
   velocity and temperature). The ME can also be estimated satisfactorily
   when a simplified term of filter surface diffusion deposition is further
   considered. By the explicit expressions of MPPS and ME, a quick
   screening for selecting a Nuclepore filter with the proper properties
   and suitable filtration conditions can be easily achieved. From the
   theoretical point of view, the explicit expressions facilitate better
   understanding of the effects of filter properties and conditions on the
   filtration characteristics. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct gas-phase epoxidation of propene to propene oxide over a
   heterogeneous catalyst holds the potential to revolutionize production
   of one of the world's major commodity chemicals. New research into
   fundamental aspects of propene chemistry on nanoparticulate catalysts
   will help guide strategies for materials development. In the current
   study, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and density
   functional theory (DFT) have been employed to explore the
   molecular-level details of propene and propene oxide binding at a
   Au/TiO2 catalyst. Competitive binding studies for propene and carbon
   monoxide reveal that propene readily displaces CO from: first,
   interfacial Au parallel to TiO2 sites, then low coordinated Au sites at
   particulate corners and edges, and finally terrace regions of the
   particles. DFT calculations show that the C=C bond of propene weakens
   upon coordination to Au, which suggests that these sites may activate
   the molecule for epoxidation. Like propene, propene oxide adsorbs on
   both Au sites and Ti sites. In addition, Ti-OH sites also readily bind
   the oxide. However, competitive binding experiments show that the
   propene oxide adsorption is favored relative to propene on all sites,
   which would likely passivate the, catalyst at room temperature. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Increased expression of vimentin intermediate filaments (VIFs) enhances
   directed cell migration, but the mechanism behind VIFs' effect on
   motility is not understood. VIFs interact with microtubules, whose
   organization contributes to polarity maintenance in migrating cells.
   Here, we characterize the dynamic coordination of VIF and microtubule
   networks in wounded monolayers of retinal pigment epithelial cells. By
   genome editing, we fluorescently labeled endogenous vimentin and
   a-tubulin, and we developed computational image analysis to delineate
   architecture and interactions of the two networks. Our results show that
   VIFs assemble an ultrastructural copy of the previously polarized
   microtubule network. Because the VIF network is long-lived compared to
   the microtubule network, VIFs template future microtubule growth along
   previous microtubule tracks, thus providing a feedback mechanism that
   maintains cell polarity. VIF knockdown prevents cells from polarizing
   and migrating properly during wound healing. We suggest that VIFs'
   templating function establishes a memory in microtubule organization
   that enhances persistence in cell polarization in general and migration
   in particular.}},

Abstract = {{A significant challenge of functional genomics is to develop methods for
   genome-scale acquisition and analysis of cell biological data. Here, we
   present an integrated method that combines genome-wide genetic
   perturbation of Saccharomyces cerevisiae with high-content screening to
   facilitate the genetic description of sub-cellular structures and
   compartment morphology. As proof of principle, we used a Rad52-GFP
   marker to examine DNA damage foci in similar to 20 million single cells
   from similar to 5,000 different mutant backgrounds in the context of
   selected genetic or chemical perturbations. Phenotypes were classified
   using a machine learning-based automated image analysis pipeline. 345
   mutants were identified that had elevated numbers of DNA damage foci,
   almost half of which were identified only in sensitized backgrounds.
   Subsequent analysis of Vid22, a protein implicated in the DNA damage
   response, revealed that it acts together with the Sgs1 helicase at sites
   of DNA damage and preferentially binds G-quadruplex regions of the
   genome. This approach is extensible to numerous other cell biological

Abstract = {{Nonthermal plasmas have emerged as a viable synthesis technique for
   nanocrystal materials. Inherently solvent and ligand-free, nonthermal
   plasmas offer the ability to synthesize high purity nanocrystals of
   materials that require high synthesis temperatures. The nonequilibrium
   environment in nonthermal plasmas has a number of attractive attributes:
   energetic surface reactions selectively heat the nanoparticles to
   temperatures that can strongly exceed the gas temperature; charging of
   nanoparticles through plasma electrons reduces or eliminates
   nanoparticle agglomeration; and the large difference between the
   chemical potentials of the gaseous growth species and the species bound
   to the nanoparticle surfaces facilitates nanocrystal doping. This paper
   reviews the state of the art in nonthermal plasma synthesis of
   nanocrystals. It discusses the fundamentals of nanocrystal formation in
   plasmas, reviews practical implementations of plasma reactors, surveys
   the materials that have been produced with nonthermal plasmas and
   surface chemistries that have been developed, and provides an overview
   of applications of plasma-synthesized nanocrystals.}},

Abstract = {{Nanofibers were prepared from water-extractable melt-blown immiscible
   polymer blends containing a commercial sulfopolyester (SP) as the

   and environment-friendly approach to high throughput fabrication of
   melt-blown nanofibers with an average diameter as small as 66 nm.
   Moreover, this approach offers a new route to prepare multilayer
   melt-blown nano-/micro-fiber composites. We demonstrate the fabrication
   of porous double-layer melt-blown PBT nano-/micro-fiber composites by
   tuning the collection time of the melt-blown SP/PBT blend fibers. Such

Abstract = {{We examine the relationship between structure and ionic conductivity in
   salt-containing ternary polymer blends that exhibit various
   microstructured morphologies, including lamellae, a hexagonal phase, and
   a bicontinuous microemulsion, as well as the disordered phase. These
   blends consist of polystyrene (PS, M-n approximate to 600 g/mol) and
   poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO, M-n approximate to 400 g/mol) homopolymers, a
   nearly symmetric PS-PEO block copolymer (M-n approximate to 4700 g/mol),
   and lithium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonamide (LiTFSI). These
   pseudoternary blends exhibit phase behavior that parallels that of
   well-studied ternary polymer blends consisting of A and B homopolymers
   compatibilized by an AB diblock copolymer. The utility of this framework
   is that all blends have nominally the same number of ethylene oxide,
   styrene, Li+, and TFSI- units, yet can exhibit a variety of
   microstructures depending on the relative ratio of the homopolymers to
   the block copolymer. For the systems studied, the ratio r =
   {[}Li+]/{[}EO] is maintained at 0.06, and the volume fraction of PS
   homopolymer is kept equal to that of PEO homopolymer plus salt. The
   total volume fraction of homopolymer is varied from 0 to 0.70. When
   heated through the order-disorder transition, all blends exhibit an
   abrupt increase in conductivity. However, analysis of small-angle X-ray
   scattering data indicates significant structure even in the disordered
   state for several blend compositions. By comparing the nature and
   structure of the disordered states with their corresponding ordered
   states, we find that this increase in conductivity through the
   order-disorder transition is most likely due to the elimination of grain
   boundaries. In either disordered or ordered states, the conductivity
   decreases as the total amount of homopolymer is increased, an
   unanticipated observation. This trend with increasing homopolymer
   loading is hypothesized to result from an increased density of ``dead
   ends{''} in the conducting channel due to poor continuity across grain
   boundaries in the ordered state and the formation of concave interfaces
   in the disordered state. The results demonstrate that disordered,
   microphase-separated morphologies provide better transport properties
   than compositionally equivalent polycrystalline systems with long-range
   order, an important criterion when optimizing the design of polymer
   electrolytes.}},

Abstract = {{Interfaces between immiscible polymer melts can exhibit significant slip
   when subjected to large shear stresses. We describe and analyze a
   slip-link/tube model of the nonlinear steady-state rheology of an
   interface between entangled immiscible polymer melts. The model assumes
   that near equilibrium shear stress is transmitted across such an
   interface primarily by chains that form loops across the interface and
   entangle with chains of the other species. Such binary interfacial
   entanglements can be created by diffusion of chain ends to the interface
   and destroyed by either Brownian reptation or slip-induced convective
   constraint release. Interfacial stress is predicted to be a nonmonotonic
   function of interfacial slip velocity, leading to the possibility of a
   stick-slip transition between an entangled state with a very low slip
   velocity and an unentangled state with a much higher slip velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Wood-degrading brown rot fungi are essential recyclers of plant biomass
   in forest ecosystems. Their efficient cellulolytic systems, which have
   potential biotechnological applications, apparently depend on a
   combination of two mechanisms: lignocellulose oxidation (LOX) by
   reactive oxygen species (ROS) and polysaccharide hydrolysis by a limited
   set of glycoside hydrolases (GHs). Given that ROS are strongly oxidizing
   and nonselective, these two steps are likely segregated. A common
   hypothesis has been that brown rot fungi use a concentration gradient of
   chelated metal ions to confine ROS generation inside wood cell walls
   before enzymes can infiltrate. We examined an alternative: that LOX
   components involved in ROS production are differentially expressed by
   brown rot fungi ahead of GH components. We used spatial mapping to
   resolve a temporal sequence in Postia placenta, sectioning thin wood
   wafers colonized directionally. Among sections, we measured gene
   expression by whole-transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) and
   assayed relevant enzyme activities. We found a marked pattern of LOX
   up-regulation in a narrow (5-mm, 48-h) zone at the hyphal front, which
   included many genes likely involved in ROS generation. Up-regulation of
   GH5 endoglucanases and many other GHs clearly occurred later, behind the
   hyphal front, with the notable exceptions of two likely expansins and a
   GH28 pectinase. Our results support a staggered mechanism for brown rot
   that is controlled by differential expression rather than
   microenvironmental gradients. This mechanism likely results in an
   oxidative pretreatment of lignocellulose, possibly facilitated by
   expansin-and pectinase-assisted cell wall swelling, before cellulases
   and hemicellulases are deployed for polysaccharide depolymerization.}},

Title = {{Observation and modelling of ferromagnetic contact-induced spin
   relaxation in Hanle spin precession measurements}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{94}},

Month = {{SEP 26}},
Abstract = {{In the nonlocal spin valve (NLSV) geometry, four-terminal electrical
   Hanle effect measurements have the potential to provide a particularly
   simple determination of the lifetime (tau(s)) and diffusion length
   (lambda(N)) of spins injected into nonmagnetic (N) materials. Recent
   papers, however, have demonstrated that traditional models typically
   used to fit such data provide an inaccurate measurement of ts in
   ferromagnet (FM)/N metal devices with low interface resistance,
   particularly when the separation of the source and detector contacts is
   small. In the transparent limit, this shortcoming is due to the back
   diffusion and subsequent relaxation of spins within the FM contacts,
   which is not properly accounted for in standard models of the Hanle
   effect. Here we have used the separation dependence of the spin
   accumulation signal in NLSVs with multiple FM/N combinations, and
   interfaces in the diffusive limit, to determine lambda(N) in traditional
   spin valve measurements. We then compare these results to Hanle
   measurements as analyzed using models that either include or exclude
   spin sinking. We demonstrate that differences between the spin valve and
   Hanle measurements of lambda(N) can be quantitatively modelled provided
   that both the FM contact-induced isotropic spin sinking and the full
   three-dimensional geometry of the devices, which is particularly
   important at small contact separations, are accounted for. We find,
   however, that considerable difficulties persist, in particular due to
   the sensitivity of fitting to the contact interface resistance and the
   FM contact magnetization rotation, in precisely determining lambda(N)
   with the Hanle technique alone, particularly at small contact
   separations.}},

Abstract = {{We generated a global genetic interaction network for Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae, constructing more than 23 million double mutants,
   identifying about 550,000 negative and about 350,000 positive genetic
   interactions. This comprehensive network maps genetic interactions for
   essential gene pairs, highlighting essential genes as densely connected
   hubs. Genetic interaction profiles enabled assembly of a hierarchical
   model of cell function, including modules corresponding to protein
   complexes and pathways, biological processes, and cellular compartments.
   Negative interactions connected functionally related genes, mapped core
   bioprocesses, and identified pleiotropic genes, whereas positive
   interactions often mapped general regulatory connections among gene
   pairs, rather than shared functionality. The global network illustrates
   how coherent sets of genetic interactions connect protein complex and
   pathway modules to map a functional wiring diagram of the cell.}},

Abstract = {{Luminescent solar concentrators downshift and concentrate the incident
   solar spectrum onto adjacent solar cells. In this paper we study the
   combination of highly performing luminescent nanocrystals with photonic
   structures to guide light to the edge of the concentrator. While one
   approach is to use a wavelength-selective Bragg mirror to reduce escape
   cone losses, we find that this also requires nearly perfect mirrors and
   luminophore quantum yield. The key issue is that light is trapped inside
   the concentrator in modes that inefficiently propagate toward the edge,
   leading to luminophore reabsorption and losses to imperfect mirrors. To
   overcome this difficulty, we use modeling to study the use of
   meta-mirrors that shift propagating photons to larger angles, minimizing
   interactions with the reabsorbing luminophores and mirrors. We find that
   this design favors mirrors with small changes in angle, separated from
   the luminophore polymer layer by an air gap. This research indicates
   that a combination of photonic structures can be used with imperfect
   luminescent materials and mirrors to enable high optical efficiency from
   luminescent concentrators.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is a
   noninvasive imaging method developed to map electrical conductivity of
   biological tissue with millimeter level spatial resolution. In MAT-MI, a
   time-varying magnetic stimulation is applied to induce eddy current
   inside the conductive tissue sample. In the presence of a static
   magnetic field, the Lorentz force acting on the induced eddy current
   drives mechanical vibrations producing detectable ultrasound signals.
   These ultrasound signals can then be acquired to reconstruct a map
   related to the sample's electrical conductivity contrast. This work
   reviews fundamental ideas of MAT-MI and major techniques developed in
   recent years. First, the physical mechanisms underlying MAT-MI imaging
   are described, including the magnetic induction and Lorentz force
   induced acoustic wave propagation. Second, experimental setups and
   various imaging strategies for MAT-MI are reviewed and compared,
   together with the corresponding experimental results. In addition, as a
   recently developed reverse mode of MAT-MI, magneto-acousto-electrical
   tomography with magnetic induction is briefly reviewed in terms of its
   theory and experimental studies. Finally, we give our opinions on
   existing challenges and future directions for MAT-MI research. With all
   the reported and future technical advancement, MAT-MI has the potential
   to become an important noninvasive modality for electrical conductivity
   imaging of biological tissue.}},

Abstract = {{Protein binding and protein-induced nanoparticle aggregation are known
   to occur for a variety of nanomaterials, with the extent of binding and
   aggregation highly dependent on nanoparticle surface properties.
   However, often lacking are techniques that enable quantification of the
   extent of protein binding and aggregation, particularly for
   nanoparticles with polydisperse size distributions. In this study, we
   adapt ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) to examine the binding of bovine
   serum albumin to commercially available anionic-surfactant-coated
   superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs), which are initially
   similar to 21 nm in mean mobility diameter and have a polydisperse size
   distribution function (geometric standard deviation near 1.4). IMS,
   carried out with a hydrosol-to-aerosol converting nebulizer, a
   differential mobility analyzer, and a condensation particle counter,
   enables measurements of SPION size distribution functions for varying
   BSA/SPION number concentration ratios. IMS measurements suggest that
   initially (at BSA concentrations below 50 nM) BSA binds reversibly to
   SPION surfaces with a binding site density in the 0:05-0.08 nm(-2)
   range. However, at higher BSA concentrations, BSA induces SPION-SPION
   aggregation, evidenced by larger shifts in SPION size distribution
   functions (mean diameters beyond 40 nm for BSA concentrations near 100
   nM) and geometric standard deviations (near 1.3) consistent with
   self-preserving aggregation theories. The onset of BSA aggregation is
   correlated with a modest but statistically significant decrease in the
   specific absorption rate (SAR) of SPIONs placed within an alternating
   magnetic field. The coating of SPIONs with mesoporous silica (MS-SPIONs)
   as well as PEGylation (MS-SPIONs-PEG) is found to completely mitigate
   BSA binding and BSA-induced aggregation; IMS-inferred size distribution
   functions are insensitive to BSA concentration for MS-SPIONs and
   MS-SPIONs-PEG. The SARs of MS-SPIONs are additionally insensitive to BSA
   concentration, confirming the SAR decrease is linked to BSA-induced
   aggregation.}},

   308, Ferrotec, USA) aggregate in aqueous suspensions; this has been
   shown to reduce SAR. Further reduction in SAR has been observed for
   SPIONs in suspensions containing cells, but the origin of this further
   reduction has not been made clear. Here, we use image analysis methods
   to quantify the structures of SPION aggregates in the extra-and
   intracellular milieu of LNCaP cell suspensions. We couple image
   characterization with nanoparticle tracking analysis and SAR
   measurements of SPION aggregates in cell-free suspensions, to better
   quantify the influence of cellular uptake on SPION aggregates and
   ultimately its influence on SAR. We find that in both the intra- and
   extracellular milieu, SPION aggregates are well-described by a
   quasifractal model, with most aggregates having fractal dimensions in
   the 1.6-2.2 range. Intracellular aggregates are found to be
   significantly larger than extracellular aggregates and are commonly
   composed of more than 103 primary SPION particles (hence they are
   ``superaggregates{''}). By using high salt concentrations to generate
   such superaggregates and measuring the SAR of suspensions, we confirm
   that it is the formation of superaggregates in the intracellular milieu
   that negatively impacts SAR, reducing it from above 200 W g(-1) Fe for
   aggregates composed of fewer than 50 primary particles to below 50 W
   g(-1) for superaggregates. While the underlying physical mechanism by
   which aggregation leads to reduction in SAR remains to be determined,
   the methods developed in this study provide insight into how cellular
   uptake influences the extent of SPION aggregation, and enable estimation
   of the reduction of SAR brought about via uptake induced aggregation.}},

Abstract = {{In the semiconductor industry, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the
   cleanroom air work as airborne molecular contamination, which reduce the
   production yield of semiconductor chips by forming nanoparticles and
   haze on silicon wafers and photomasks under ultraviolet irradiation
   during photolithography processes. Even though VOCs in outdoor air are
   removed by gas filters, VOCs can be emitted from many kinds of materials
   used in cleanrooms, such as organic solvents and construction materials
   (e.g., adhesives, flame retardants and sealants), threatening the
   production of semiconductors. Therefore, finding new replacements that
   emit lower VOCs is now essential in the semiconductor industry. In this
   study, we developed a real-time and online method to screen materials
   for developing the replacements by converting VOCs into nanoparticles
   under soft X-ray irradiation. This screening method was applied to
   measure VOCs emitted from different kinds of organic solvents and
   adhesives. Our results showed good repeatability and high sensitivity
   for VOCs, which come from aromatic compounds, some alcohols and all
   tested adhesives (Super glue and cleanroom-use adhesives). In addition,
   the overall trend of measured VOCs from cleanroom-use adhesives was well
   matched with those measured by a commercial thermal desorption-gas
   chromatographymass spectrometry, which is a widely used off-line method
   for analyzing VOCs. Based on the results, this screening method can help
   accelerate the developing process for reducing VOCs in cleanrooms.}},

Title = {{DNA replication stress mediates APOBEC3 family mutagenesis in breast
   cancer}},
Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: The APOBEC3 family of cytidine deaminases mutate the cancer
   genome in a range of cancer types. Although many studies have documented
   the downstream effects of APOBEC3 activity through next-generation
   sequencing, less is known about their upstream regulation. In this
   study, we sought to identify a molecular basis for APOBEC3 expression
   and activation.
   Results: HER2 amplification and PTEN loss promote DNA replication stress
   and APOBEC3B activity in vitro and correlate with APOBEC3 mutagenesis in
   vivo. HER2-enriched breast carcinomas display evidence of elevated
   levels of replication stress-associated DNA damage in vivo. Chemical and
   cytotoxic induction of replication stress, through aphidicolin,
   gemcitabine, camptothecin or hydroxyurea exposure, activates
   transcription of APOBEC3B via an ATR/Chk1-dependent pathway in vitro.
   APOBEC3B activation can be attenuated through repression of oncogenic
   signalling, small molecule inhibition of receptor tyrosine kinase
   signalling and alleviation of replication stress through nucleoside
   supplementation.
   Conclusion: These data link oncogene, loss of tumour suppressor gene and
   drug-induced replication stress with APOBEC3B activity, providing new
   insights into how cytidine deaminase-induced mutagenesis might be
   activated in tumourigenesis and limited therapeutically.}},

Abstract = {{The onset of distant organ metastasis from primary breast cancer marks
   the transition to a stage IV diagnosis. Standard imaging modalities
   often detect distant metastasis when the burden of disease is high,
   underscoring the need for improved methods of detection to allow for
   interventions that would impede disease progression. Here, microporous
   poly(e-caprolactone) scaffolds were developed that capture early
   metastatic cells and thus serve as a sentinel for early detection. These
   scaffolds were used to characterize the dynamic immune response to the
   implant spanning the acute and chronic foreign body response. The immune
   cell composition had stabilized at the scaffold after approximately 1
   month and changed dramatically within days to weeks after tumor
   inoculation, with CD11b(+)Gr1(hi)Ly6C(-) cells having the greatest
   increase in abundance. Implanted scaffolds recruited metastatic cancer
   cells that were inoculated into the mammary fat pad in vivo, which also
   significantly reduced tumor burden in the liver and brain. Additionally,
   cancer cells could be detected using a label-free imaging modality
   termed inverse spectroscopic optical coherence tomography, and we tested
   the hypothesis that subsequent removal of the primary tumor after early
   detection would enhance survival. Surgical removal of the primary tumor
   following cancer cell detection in the scaffold significantly improved
   disease-specific survival. The enhanced disease-specific survival was
   associated with a systemic reduction in the CD11b(+)Gr1(hi)Ly6C(-) cells
   as a consequence of the implant, which was further supported by Gr-1
   depletion studies. Implementation of the scaffold may provide diagnostic
   and therapeutic options for cancer patients in both the high-risk and
   adjuvant treatment settings. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

Title = {{Super-Resolution Compressed Sensing for Line Spectral Estimation: An

Abstract = {{Conventional compressed sensing theory assumes signals have sparse
   representations in a known dictionary. Nevertheless, in many practical
   applications such as line spectral estimation, the sparsifying
   dictionary is usually characterized by a set of unknown parameters in a
   continuous domain. To apply the conventional compressed sensing
   technique to such applications, the continuous parameter space has to be
   discretized to a finite set of grid points, based on which a ``nominal
   dictionary{''} is constructed for sparse signal recovery.
   Discretization, however, inevitably incurs errors since the true
   parameters do not necessarily lie on the discretized grid. This error,
   also referred to as grid mismatch, leads to deteriorated recovery
   performance. In this paper, we consider the line spectral estimation
   problem and propose an iterative reweighted method which jointly
   estimates the sparse signals and the unknown parameters associated with
   the true dictionary. The proposed algorithm is developed by iteratively
   decreasing a surrogate function majorizing a given log-sum objective
   function, leading to a gradual and interweaved iterative process to
   refine the unknown parameters and the sparse signal. A simple yet
   effective scheme is developed for adaptively updating the regularization
   parameter that controls the tradeoff between the sparsity of the
   solution and the data fitting error. Theoretical analysis is conducted
   to justify the proposed method. Simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithm achieves super resolution and outperforms other
   state-of-the-art methods in many cases of practical interest.}},

Abstract = {{Bmiocatalyzed artificial photosynthesis systems provide a promising
   strategy to store solar energy in a great variety of chemicals. However,
   the lack of direct interface between the light-capturing components and
   the oxidoreductase generally hinders the trafficking of the chemicals
   and photo-excited electrons into the active center of the redox
   biocatalysts. To address this problem, a completely integrated
   artificial photosynthesis system for enhanced electronic energy-transfer
   efficacy is reported by combining co-axial electrospinning/electrospray
   and layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly. The biocatalysis part including
   multiple oxidoreductases and coenzymes NAD(H) was in situ encapsulated
   inside the lumen polyelectrolyte-doped hollow nanofibers or
   microcapsules fabricated via co-axial electrospinning/electrospray;
   while the precise and spatial arrangement of the photocatalysis part,
   including electron mediator and photosensitizer for photo-regeneration
   of the coenzyme, was achieved by ion-exchange interaction-driven LbL
   self-assembly. The feasibility and advantages of this integrated
   artificial photosynthesis system is fully demonstrated by the catalyzed
   cascade reduction of CO2 to methanol by three dehydrogenases (formate,
   formaldehyde, and alcohol dehydrogenases), incorporating the
   photo-regeneration of NADH under visible-light irradiation. Compared to
   solution-based systems, the methanol yield increases from 35.6\% to
   90.6\% using the integrated artificial photosynthesis. This work
   provides a novel platform for the efficient and sustained production of
   a broad range of chemicals and fuels from sunlight.}},

Title = {{Structure-Function Analysis of the Two-Peptide Bacteriocin Plantaricin
   EF}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},

Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{5106-5116}},
Month = {{SEP 13}},
Abstract = {{Plantaricin EF is a two-peptide bacteriocin that depends on the
   complementary action of two different peptides (PlnE and PlnF) to
   function. The structures of the individual peptides have previously been
   analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (Fimland, N. et al.
   (2008), Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1784, 1711-1719), but the bacteriocin
   structure and how the two peptides interact have not been determined.
   All two-peptide bacteriocins identified so far contain GxxxG motifs.
   These motifs, together with GxxxG-like motifs, are known to mediate
   helix helix interactions in membrane proteins. We have mutated all GxxxG
   and GxxxG-like motifs in PlnE and PlnF in order to determine if any of
   these motifs are important for antimicrobial activity and thus possibly
   for interactions between PlnE and PlnF. Moreover, the aromatic amino
   acids Tyr and Trp in PlnE and PlnF were substituted, and four fusion
   polypeptides were constructed in order to investigate the relative
   orientation of PlnE and PlnF in target cell membranes. The results
   obtained with the fusion polypeptides indicate that PlnE and PlnF
   interact in an antiparallel manner and that the C-terminus of PlnE and
   N-terminus of PlnF are on the outer part of target cell membranes and
   the N-terminus of PlnE and C-terminus of PlnF are on the inner part. The
   preference for an aromatic residue at position 6 in PlnE suggests a
   positioning of this residue in or near the membrane interface on the
   cells inside. Mutations in the GxxxG motifs indicate that the
   G(5)xxxG(9) motif in PlnE and the S(26)xxxG(30) motif in PlnF are
   involved in helix helix interactions. Atomistic molecular dynamics
   simulation of a structural model consistent with the results confirmed
   the stability of the structure and its orientation in membranes. The
   simulation approved the anticipated interactions and revealed additional
   interactions that further increase the stability of the proposed
   structure.}},

Abstract = {{We report a reactive polymer platform for the rapid discovery of
   strongly segregated diblock polymers that microphase separate into
   well-defined morphologies with sub-5 nm features. Our strategy employs
   reactive poly(styrene-block-2-vinyl-4,4-dimethylazlactone) (SV) polymers
   with low degrees of polymerization (N), in which the V blocks undergo
   selective and quantitative reactions with functional primary amines, to
   identify new poly(acrylamides) that are highly immiscible with
   poly(styrene) and induce block polymer self-assembly. Using a
   combination of optical birefringence and small-angle X-ray scattering
   (SAXS), we characterize a library of 17 block polymers produced by amine
   functionalization of four parent SV diblocks synthesized by sequential
   RAFT polymerizations. We demonstrate that V block functionalization with
   hydroxy- and methoxy-functional amines yields diblocks that order into
   lamellar mesophases with half-pitches as small as 3.8 nm. Thus, this
   azlactone-based reactive molecular platform enables combinatorial
   generation of polymer libraries with diverse side chain structures that
   may be rapidly screened to identify new high chi/low N systems for
   self-assembly at ever decreasing length scales.}},

Abstract = {{A series of poly(cyclohexylethylene-ran-ethylene) (CE) copolymers were
   synthesized with statistical segment lengths designed to match that of
   isotactic poly(propylene) (iPP). Melt blending the CE compounds
   containing 5070 wt \% cyclohexylethylene repeat units with iPP at
   loadings between 5 and 20 wt \% resulted in a dispersion of CE droplets
   with number-average diameters between 150 and 500 nm as determined by
   scanning electron microscopy. Linear dynamic mechanical elastic (G') and
   loss (G `') moduli data were fit to the Palierne model providing
   estimates for the interfacial tension between iPP and CE, which was
   interpreted based on enthalpic (chi H) and entropic (chi(S))
   contributions to the overall segmentsegment interaction parameter, chi =
   chi(H) + chi(S), attributed to density and statistical segment length
   differences, respectively. The small particle sizes are explained by a
   reduced interfacial tension, driven by minimization of chi(S)
   (approximate to 0), counterbalanced by chi(H) > 0, establishing an
   optimal balance between phase separation and dispersion during blending
   at practical molecular weights. The optically clear blends exhibit
   superior tensile mechanical properties, with the strain at break
   increasing from 20\% for iPP to 400\% at a loading of 5 wt \%,
   attributable to shear yielding of the matrix triggered by cavitation of
   the uniformly dispersed CE copolymer particles.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the complexation of poly(styrenesulfonate) with micelles
   containing both cationic and hydrophilic blocks in their coronas. Five
   distinct micelles were prepared by self-assembly, using D+S, OS, OD+S,
   D+OS, and mixtures of D+S and OS block polymers, where the hydrophobic S
   blocks (poly(styrene)) form the micelle cores and the cationic D+ blocks
   (poly(dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate)) and hydrophilic, nonionic 0
   blocks (poly(oligo(ethylene glycol) methyl ether methacrylate)) form the
   coronas. Turbidimetric titration and dynamic light scattering
   measurements on complexes with short poly(styrenesulfonate) chains (M
   approximate to 1 kg/mol) that can equilibrate quickly reveal that the
   intrinsic colloidal stability of the complexes is determined by the
   identity of the outermost block of the micelle corona and that
   architectures with a nonionic solvating outer block promote the
   formation of soluble single-micelle complexes even when the complexes
   are fully neutralized. Although complexes with longer
   poly(styrenesulfonate) chains (M approximate to 30 kg/mol) are
   kinetically trapped in aggregates for all cation containing micelle
   architectures, studies at high ionic strength show that inclusion of the
   outer hydrophilic block can successfully limit the size of the complexes
   and inhibit overall phase separation of neutralized complexes. Finally,
   the molecular weight dependence of the aggregation process for complexes
   of the OD'S architecture demonstrates that bridging is the predominant
   mechanism for aggregation and that careful selection of the polymer
   architecture and molecular weight can provide a useful strategy for
   controlling the structure and colloidal stability of hierarchical
   complexes.}},

   atomic-scale thickness challenges the commonly employed elastic
   continuum idealizations. Using objective boundary conditions and a
   density functional based potential, we directly uncover the flexibility
   of individual alpha, beta, and gamma phosphorene allotrope layers along
   an arbitrary bending direction. A correlation analysis with the in-plane
   elasticity finds that although a monolayer thickness cannot be defined
   in the classical continuum sense, an unusual orthotropic plate with a
   directional-dependent thickness can unambiguously describe the
   out-of-plane deformation of alpha and gamma allotropes. Such decoupling
   of the in-plane and out-of-plane nanomechanics might be generic for
   two-dimensional materials beyond graphene.}},

Abstract = {{The primate gastrointestinal tract is home to trillions of bacteria,
   whose composition is associated with numerous metabolic, autoimmune, and
   infectious human diseases. Although there is increasing evidence that
   modern and Westernized societies are associated with dramatic loss of
   natural human gut microbiome diversity, the causes and consequences of
   such loss are challenging to study. Here we use nonhuman primates (NHPs)
   as a model system for studying the effects of emigration and lifestyle
   disruption on the human gut microbiome. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing
   in two model NHP species, we show that although different primate
   species have distinctive signature microbiota in the wild, in captivity
   they lose their native microbes and become colonized with Prevotella and
   Bacteroides, the dominant genera in the modern human gut microbiome. We
   confirm that captive individuals from eight other NHP species in a
   different zoo show the same pattern of convergence, and that semicaptive
   primates housed in a sanctuary represent an intermediate microbiome
   state between wild and captive. Using deep shotgun sequencing, chemical
   dietary analysis, and chloroplast relative abundance, we show that
   decreasing dietary fiber and plant content are associated with the
   captive primate microbiome. Finally, in a meta-analysis including
   published human data, we show that captivity has a parallel effect on
   the NHP gut microbiome to that of Westernization in humans. These
   results demonstrate that captivity and lifestyle disruption cause
   primates to lose native microbiota and converge along an axis toward the
   modern human microbiome.}},

Abstract = {{Dihydromyricetin (DMY) is a natural flavanol compound isolated from a
   traditional Chinese medicine, Ampelopsis grossedentata. Despite that
   optically pure (+)DMY is desired for treating chronic pharyngitis and
   alcohol use disorders, only DMY racemate is commercially available due
   to prolonged exposure time to high temperature and the presence of metal
   ions during industrial extraction, which cause racemization of the
   homochiral (+)DMY. We have developed an extraction method for
   successfully obtain optically pure (+)DMY. We have further assessed the
   physicochemical properties of the two phases using PXRD, DSC, TGA, FTIR,
   and moisture sorption. Among them, PXRD and FT-IR are suitable for
   quickly distinguishing homochiral (+)DMY from racemic (+/-)DMY. Lastly,
   with the aid of cocrystallization with theophylline, the absolute
   configuration of homochiral (+)DMY was identified to be (2R, 3R). (C)

Abstract = {{Epileptic seizure emergencies are life-threatening conditions, which in
   their most severe form, status epilepticus, have a high mortality rate
   if not quickly terminated. Treatment requires rapid delivery of
   anti-epileptics such as benzodiazepines to the brain. The nasal route is
   attractive due to its non-invasiveness, potential for direct nose to
   brain delivery, high vascularity, relatively large absorptive surface
   area, and avoidance of intestinal/livermetabolism. However, the limited
   volume of the nasal cavity and poor water solubility of anti-epileptics
   restrict absorption, leading to insufficient therapeutic brain levels.
   This review covers various formulation approaches adopted to improve
   nasal delivery of drugs, especially benzodiazepines, used to treat
   seizure emergencies. Other general topics such as nasal anatomy,
   challenges to nasal delivery, and drug/formulation considerations for
   nose to brain delivery are also discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Drosophila is an excellent model organism towards understanding the

   of aging and other long-term dynamics on the behavior serve as important

   are presenting a new imaging technique for lifetime monitoring of
   Drosophila in 3D at spatial and temporal resolutions capable of
   resolving the motion of limbs and wings using holographic principles.
   The developed system is capable of monitoring and extracting various
   behavioral parameters, such as ethograms and spatial distributions, from
   a group of flies simultaneously. This technique can image complicated
   leg and wing motions of flies at a resolution, which allows capturing
   specific landing responses from the same data set. Overall, this system
   provides a unique opportunity for high throughput screenings of
   behavioral changes in 3D over a long term in Drosophila.}},

Abstract = {{We applied an atmospheric pressure differential mobility analyzer (DMA)
   coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer to examine the stability,
   mass-mobility relationship, and extent of hydration of
   dimethylamine-sulfuric acid cluster ions, which are of relevance to
   nucleation in ambient air. Cluster ions were generated by electrospray
   ionization and were of the form: {[}H((CH3)(2)NH)(x)(H2SO4)(y)](+) and
   {[}(HSO4)((CH3)(2)NH)(x)(H2SO4)(y)](-), where 4 <= x <= 8, and 5 <= y <=
   12. Under dry conditions, we find that positively charged cluster ions
   dissociated via loss of both multiple dimethylamine and sulfuric acid
   molecules after mobility analysis but prior to mass analysis, and few
   parent ions were detected in the mass spectrometer. Dissociation also
   occurred for negative ions, but to a lesser extent than for positive
   ions for the same mass spectrometer inlet conditions. Under humidified
   conditions (relative humidities up to 30\% in the DMA), positively
   charged cluster ion dissociation in the mass spectrometer inlet was
   mitigated and occurred primarily by H2SO4 loss from ions containing
   excess acid molecules. DMA measurements were used to infer collision
   cross sections (CCSs) for all identifiable cluster ions. Stokes-Millikan
   equation and diffuse/inelastic gas molecule scattering predicted CCSs
   overestimate measured CCSs by more than 15\%, while elastic-specular
   collision model predictions are in good agreement with measurements.
   Finally, cluster ion hydration was examined by monitoring changes in
   CCSs with increasing relative humidity. All examined cluster ions showed
   a modest amount of water molecule adsorption, with percentage increases
   in CCS smaller than 10\%. The extent of hydration correlates directly
   with cluster ion acidity for positive ions.}},

Abstract = {{In many commercially available and in-house-prepared reference
   electrodes, nanoporous glass frits (often of the brand named Vycor)
   contain the electrolyte solution that forms a salt bridge between the
   sample and the reference solution. Recently, we showed that in samples
   with low ionic strength, the half-cell potentials of reference
   electrodes comprising nanoporous Vycor frits are affected by the sample
   and can shift in response to the sample composition by more than 50 mV
   (which can cause up to 900\% error in potentiometric measurements). It
   was confirmed that the large potential variations result from
   electrostatic screening of ion transfer through the frit due to the
   negatively charged surfaces of the glass nanopores. Since the commercial
   production of porous Vycor glass was recently discontinued, new
   materials have been used lately as porous frits in commercially
   available reference electrodes, namely flits made of Teflon,
   polyethylene, or one of two porous glasses sold under the brand names
   CoralPor and Electro-porous KT. In this work, we studied the effect of
   the frit characteristics on the performance of reference electrodes, and
   show that the unwanted changes in the reference potential are not unique
   to electrodes with Vycor frits. Increasing the pore size in the glass
   frits from the <10 nm into the 1 mu m range or switching to polymeric
   frits with pores in the 1 to 10 mu m range nearly eliminates the
   potential variations caused by electrostatic screening of ion transport
   through the frit pores. Unfortunately, bigger frit pores result
   in-larger flow rates of the reference solution through the pores, which
   can result in the contamination of test solutions.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Abstract = {{Laser-initiated switching of magnetization direction in ferrimagnetic
   rare-earth-transition-metal (RE-TM) alloys-whether laser induced or
   photothermal via compensation point-is being vigorously pursued owing to
   the promise of extending operating frequencies of magnetic devices into
   the terahertz regime. Despite intense interest, however, the effects of
   repeated laser exposure on the film structure and subsequent switching
   behavior have yet to be investigated. In order to better understand the
   correlated effects of femtosecond-laser irradiation on both the magnetic
   response and photoinduced morphological variations of RE-TM alloys, we
   performed in situ Fresnel transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on
   Tb23Co77 thin films with Ta protecting layers. Via optical access to the
   specimen in a modified TEM, we irradiated the thin films in situ with
   both individual and series of femtosecond optical pulses, and correlated
   laser-induced changes in magnetic domain-wall formation and growth with
   photothermal crystal formation and accompanying pinnedmagnetic sites. We
   find that, for a range of applied laser fluences and numbers of
   individual pulses, several distinct regions are formed displaying varied
   magnetic behavior (switchable, nonswitchable, demagnetized) and
   morphological features (small-to-large crystal-grain variations).
   Through a series of systematic studies, we quantified these linked
   magnetic and morphological properties as a function of laser fluence,
   number of pulse-train cycles, and number of individual femtosecond-laser
   pulses and the duration between each. Our results show how the sensitive
   connection between magnetic behavior and morphological structure can
   emerge in magneto-optic experiments across several parameters, thus
   illustrating the need for rigorous characterization so that potential
   operating regimes may be universally identified.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Transcranial focused ultrasound (tFUS) has been introduced as
   a noninvasive neuromodulation technique with good spatial selectivity.
   We report an experimental investigation to detect noninvasive
   electrophysiological response induced by low-intensity tFUS in an in
   vivo animal model and perform electrophysiological source imaging (ESI)
   of tFUS-induced brain activity from noninvasive scalp EEG recordings.
   Methods: A single-element ultrasound transducer was used to generate
   low-intensity tFUS (I-spta < 1 mW/cm(2)) and induce brain activation at
   multiple selected sites in an in vivo rat model. Up to 16 scalp
   electrodes were used to record tFUS-induced EEG. Event-related
   potentials were analyzed in time, frequency, and spatial domains.
   Current source distributions were estimated by ESI to reconstruct
   spatiotemporal distributions of brain activation induced by tFUS.
   Results: Neuronal activation was observed following low-intensity tFUS,
   as correlated to tFUS intensity and sonication duration. ESI revealed
   initial focal activation in cortical area corresponding to tFUS
   stimulation site and the activation propagating to surrounding areas
   over time. Conclusion: The present results demonstrate the feasibility
   of noninvasively recording brain electrophysiological response in vivo
   following low-intensity tFUS stimulation, and the feasibility of imaging
   spatiotemporal distributions of brain activation as induced by tFUS in
   vivo. Significance: The present approach may lead to a new means of
   imaging brain activity using tFUS perturbation and a closed-loop
   ESI-guided tFUS neuromodulation modality.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses the selection of metal extraction technologies
   according to the regional availability of energy resources. The most
   important energy sources in iron and steel production are determined
   from a review of current technologies to inform possible future
   scenarios of capacity replacement or expansion according to geography.
   Alternative technologies are not discussed, considering that actual
   investment in capacity is most often dominated by high degrees of risk
   aversion. As such, only technologies proven at a reasonable scale are
   included in the selection matrix. Scenarios of capacity choice are
   defined in terms of actions from external agents, those which are not
   directly involved in the industry but have the capacity to regulate
   actions by metal producing players. Two extreme scenarios corresponding
   to closed and open economies are used to set bounds for future
   expectations. Among steelmaking processes under fully open trade
   conditions, it is found that EAF steelmaking with charge pre-heat should
   be the technology of choice in all regions of the world except for South
   America and Europe, where Integrated Steel Mills have a cost advantage.
   In fully closed exchange scenarios, Integrated Steel Mills would be the
   prevalent technology in South America, Sub-Saharan Africa, India, and
   the former USSR, EAF with scrap pre-heating prevailing in all other
   regions. On the other hand, HYL-ZR would be the iron making technology
   of choice in all regions under full exchange scenarios. Under fully
   closed exchange conditions, Mini-Blast Furnaces, COREX, and HYL-ZR would
   find regional applications. Increases in raw materials and energy costs
   of 38 pct in steelmaking and 63 pct in ironmaking are found in going
   from fully open to fully closed exchange regimes. It is also found that
   Southeast Asia is the most suitable region for deploying new steelmaking
   capacity, while Australia and Russia are the best selection for new iron
   making capacity. (C) ASM International (ASM) and The Minerals, Metals \&

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The development of methods for implementing solid state imaging
   electronics on flexible substrates could impact areas including
   conformable infrared detection, night vision, and medical imaging.
   Various unconventional mechanisms for solid state imaging have been
   demonstrated. However, solid state imaging electronics have rarely been
   developed in a flexible form factor, which is a critical format for
   next-generation devices such as wearable displays, conformable imaging
   arrays, and electronic paper. Among various potential mechanisms for
   solid state imaging, smart materials are particularly attractive due to
   their inherent ability for converting external stimuli into electrical
   signals directly. Here, we introduce a flexible photodetector array that
   is enabled by growing a barium strontium titanate (BST) film on a
   flexible substrate. A pixelated array is then patterned on the film.
   When a spatially resolved laser beam is rastered over the film, pixels
   are individually illuminated. By recording the signals from all pixels,
   the laser trace can be successfully reconstructed, thereby realizing a
   flexible photodetector array. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The deformation behavior of lead zirconate titanate bulk ceramic
   specimen under uniaxial compression was monitored by the digital image
   correlation method and the homogeneity of the deformation was discussed.
   Combined with using a Sawyer-Tower circuit, the depolarization curve was
   also obtained. Because of the friction at both the top and bottom
   surfaces of the lead zirconate titanate ceramic specimen, the
   distribution of deformation under large uniaxial compressive stresses
   usually shows a barrel shape. By focusing on correspondingly selected
   regions of interest and calculating the values of strain components
   there, the barreling behavior was proved. This barreling behavior is due
   to elastic strains, in the first place, while the remnant strains are
   less affected by this phenomenon. All these findings are the
   experimental justifications for the selection of an aspect ratio of 3:1
   for our specimens, where only the central cubic region of a specimen
   represents the desired purely uniaxial stress state. Only from this
   region, true uniaxial stress-strain results can be obtained to develop
   constitutive models.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop a heart-rate independent breath-held joint T-1-T-2
   mapping sequence for accurate simultaneous estimation of coregistered
   myocardial T-1 and T-2 maps.
   Methods: A novel preparation scheme combining both a saturation pulse
   and T-2-preparation in a single R-R interval is introduced. The time
   between these two pulses, as well as the duration of the T-2-preparation
   is varied in each heartbeat, acquiring images with different T-1 and T-2
   weightings, and no magnetization dependence on previous images.
   Inherently coregistered T-1 and T-2 maps are calculated from these
   images. Phantom imaging is performed to compare the proposed maps with
   spin echo references. In vivo imaging is performed in ten subjects,
   comparing the accuracy and precision of the proposed technique to
   existing myocardial T-1 and T-2 mapping sequences of the same duration.
   Results: Phantom experiments show that the proposed technique provides
   accurate quantification of T-1 and T-2 values over a wide-range (T-1:
   260 ms to 1460 ms, T-2: 40 ms to 200 ms). In vivo imaging shows that the
   proposed sequence quantifies T-1 and T-2 values similar to a
   saturation-based T-1 mapping and a conventional breath-hold T-2 mapping
   sequence, respectively.
   Conclusion: The proposed sequence allows joint estimation of accurate
   and coregistered quantitative myocardial T-1 and T-2 maps in a single
   breath-hold. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Title = {{Rational promoter elements and evolutionary engineering approaches for
   efficient xylose fermentation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We screened and identified a set of efficient promoters in Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae that maintained their relatively strong strengths to regulate
   the heterologous xylose-assimilating pathway genes XYL1 and XYL2, and
   native XKS1 and pentose phosphate pathway four genes, irrespective of
   glucose or xylose fermentation medium. In this study, we developed a
   rapid and efficient xylose-fermenting S. cerevisiae strain 7-1 based on
   balanced pathway expression levels driven by our proposed strong
   promoters. Next, 7-1 was used to initialize the evolutionary
   engineering, through first aerobic and anaerobic sequential batch
   cultivation. The finally evolved strain of 7-1E1 displayed a high
   ethanol yield (0.45 g/g) and low xylitol accumulation (0.13 g/g).
   Moreover, the evolved strain of 7-1E1 displays great potential for
   ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass. This work reveals that
   efficient xylose assimilation is attributed to the elevated expression
   levels of xylose utilization genes, which was accomplished through the
   strong promoter rational regulation in the chromosome of the evolved
   strain. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{We have developed a multi-scale model describing the dynamics of
   internal segments of DNA in nanochannels used for genome mapping. In
   addition to the channel geometry, the model takes as its inputs the DNA
   properties in free solution (persistence length, effective width,
   molecular weight, and segmental hydrodynamic radius) and buffer
   properties (temperature and viscosity). Using pruned-enriched Rosenbluth
   simulations of a discrete wormlike chain model with circa 10 base pair
   resolution and a numerical solution for the hydrodynamic interactions in
   confinement, we convert these experimentally available inputs into the
   necessary parameters for a one-dimensional, Rouse-like model of the
   confined chain. The resulting coarse-grained model resolves the DNA at a
   length scale of approximately 6 kilobase pairs in the absence of any
   global hairpin folds, and is readily studied using a normal-mode
   analysis or Brownian dynamics simulations. The Rouse-like model
   successfully reproduces both the trends and order of magnitude of the
   relaxation time of the distance between labeled segments of DNA obtained
   in experiments. The model also provides insights that are not readily
   accessible from experiments, such as the role of the molecular weight of
   the DNA and location of the labeled segments that impact the statistical
   models used to construct genome maps from data acquired in nanochannels.
   The multi-scale approach used here, while focused towards a
   technologically relevant scenario, is readily adapted to other channel
   sizes and polymers. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Development of an advanced microfluidic micropipette aspiration device
   for single cell mechanics studies}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Various micro-engineered tools or platforms have been developed recently
   for cell mechanics studies based on acoustic, magnetic, and optical
   actuations. Compared with other techniques for single cell
   manipulations, microfluidics has the advantages with simple working
   principles and device implementations. In this work, we develop a
   multi-layer microfluidic pipette aspiration device integrated with
   pneumatically actuated microfluidic control valves. This configuration
   enables decoupling of cell trapping and aspiration, and hence causes
   less mechanical perturbation on trapped single cells before aspiration.
   A high trapping efficiency is achieved by the microfluidic channel
   design based on fluid resistance model and deterministic microfluidics.
   Compared to conventional micropipette aspiration, the suction pressure
   applied on the aspirating cells is highly stable due to the viscous
   nature of low Reynolds number flow. As a proof-of-concept of this novel
   microfluidic technology, we built a microfluidic pipette aspiration
   device with 2 x 13 trapping arrays and used this device to measure the
   stiffness of a human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB231, through the
   observation of cell deformations during aspiration. As a comparison, we
   studied the effect of Taxol, a FDA-approved anticancer drug on single
   cancer cell stiffness. We found that cancer cells treated with Taxol
   were less deformable with a higher Young's modulus. The multi-layer
   microfluidic pipette aspiration device is a scalable technology for
   single cell mechanophenotyping studies and drug discovery applications.

Journal = {{MECHATRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{68-75}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Exoskeleton robots require powerful and lightweight power supplies.
   Because of its high power-to-mass ratio and fast response, hydraulic
   systems can meet the requirement for locomotion robots. In this paper, a
   novel compact hydraulic power unit (CHPU) is proposed. A two-stroke IC
   engine, with a rated power of 2.4 kW at 13,000 rpm, is used as the prime
   mover. The engine drives a high speed (10,000 rpm) piston pump to allow
   the engine to operate at high power. A spring loaded reservoir has been
   developed to prevent the pump intake from cavitation and contamination.
   The payload flow rate is indirectly estimated using the displacements of
   the actuator. A Ragone plot analysis shows that the CHPU can maintain a
   high specific power over a long duration. A dynamic model for the CHPU
   has been developed based upon simplified engine operating
   characteristics and a set of experimentally identified parameters. A
   prototype of the CHPU has been constructed with a rated power of 1.45 kW
   and a weight of 16.6 kg. Experimental testing of the prototype confirms
   the dynamic model and the output capacity of the CHPU. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Chinese hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines are the dominant industrial
   workhorses for therapeutic recombinant protein production. The
   availability of genome sequence of Chinese hamster and CHO cells will
   spur further genome and RNA sequencing of producing cell lines. However,
   the mammalian genomes assembled using shot-gun sequencing data still
   contain regions of uncertain quality due to assembly errors. Identifying
   high confidence regions in the assembled genome will facilitate its use
   for cell engineering and genome engineering. We assembled two
   independent drafts of Chinese hamster genome by de novo assembly from
   shotgun sequencing reads and by re-scaffolding and gap-filling the draft
   genome from NCBI for improved scaffold lengths and gap fractions. We
   then used the two independent assemblies to identify high confidence
   regions using two different approaches. First, the two independent
   assemblies were compared at the sequence level to identify their
   consensus regions as high confidence regions which accounts for at least
   78 \% of the assembled genome. Further, a genome wide comparison of the
   Chinese hamster scaffolds with mouse chromosomes revealed scaffolds with
   large blocks of collinearity, which were also compiled as high-quality
   scaffolds. Genome scale collinearity was complemented with EST based
   synteny which also revealed conserved gene order compared to mouse. As
   cell line sequencing becomes more commonly practiced, the approaches
   reported here are useful for assessing the quality of assembly and
   potentially facilitate the engineering of cell lines.}},

Title = {{Optomechanical measurement of photon spin angular momentum and optical
   torque in integrated photonic devices}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Photons carry linear momentum and spin angular momentum when circularly
   or elliptically polarized. During light-matter interaction, transfer of
   linear momentum leads to optical forces, whereas transfer of angular
   momentum induces optical torque. Optical forces including radiation
   pressure and gradient forces have long been used in optical tweezers and
   laser cooling. In nanophotonic devices, optical forces can be
   significantly enhanced, leading to unprecedented optomechanical effects
   in both classical and quantum regimes. In contrast, to date, the angular
   momentum of light and the optical torque effect have only been used in
   optical tweezers but remain unexplored in integrated photonics. We
   demonstrate the measurement of the spin angular momentum of photons
   propagating in a birefringent waveguide and the use of optical torque to
   actuate rotational motion of an optomechanical device. We show that the
   sign and magnitude of the optical torque are determined by the photon
   polarization states that are synthesized on the chip. Our study reveals
   the mechanical effect of photon's polarization degree of freedom and
   demonstrates its control in integrated photonic devices. Exploiting
   optical torque and optomechanical interaction with photon angular
   momentum can lead to torsional cavity optomechanics and optomechanical
   photon spin-orbit coupling, as well as applications such as
   optomechanical gyroscopes and torsional magnetometry.}},

Title = {{Cancer Cell Fusion: Mechanisms Slowly Unravel}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Although molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways driving invasion
   and metastasis have been studied for many years, the origin of the
   population of metastatic cells within the primary tumor is still not
   well understood. About a century ago, Aichel proposed that cancer cell
   fusion was a mechanism of cancer metastasis. This hypothesis gained some
   support over the years, and recently became the focus of many studies
   that revealed increasing evidence pointing to the possibility that
   cancer cell fusion probably gives rise to the metastatic phenotype by
   generating widespread genetic and epigenetic diversity, leading to the
   emergence of critical populations needed to evolve resistance to the
   treatment and development of metastasis. In this review, we will discuss
   the clinical relevance of cancer cell fusion, describe emerging
   mechanisms of cancer cell fusion, address why inhibiting cancer cell
   fusion could represent a critical line of attack to limit drug
   resistance and to prevent metastasis, and suggest one new modality for
   doing so.}},

Title = {{The DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3H haplotype I likely contributes to
   breast and lung cancer mutagenesis}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Cytosine mutations within TCA/T motifs are common in cancer. A likely
   cause is the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B). However, A3B-null
   breast tumours still have this mutational bias. Here we show that
   APOBEC3H haplotype I (A3H-I) provides a likely solution to this paradox.
   A3B-null tumours with this mutational bias have at least one copy of
   A3H-I despite little genetic linkage between these genes. Although
   deemed inactive previously, A3H-I has robust activity in biochemical and
   cellular assays, similar to A3H-II after compensation for lower protein
   expression levels. Gly105 in A3H-I (versus Arg105 in A3H-II) results in
   lower protein expression levels and increased nuclear localization,
   providing a mechanism for accessing genomic DNA. A3H-I also associates
   with clonal TCA/T-biased mutations in lung adenocarcinoma suggesting
   this enzyme makes broader contributions to cancer mutagenesis. These
   studies combine to suggest that A3B and A3H-I, together, explain the
   bulk of `APOBEC signature' mutations in cancer.}},

Abstract = {{Treatment of congenital heart defects in children requiring right
   ventricular outflow tract reconstruction typically involves multiple
   open-heart surgeries because all existing graft materials have no growth
   potential. Here we present an `off-the-shelf' vascular graft grown from
   donor fibroblasts in a fibrin gel to address this critical unmet need.
   In a proof-of-concept study, the decellularized grafts are implanted as
   a pulmonary artery replacement in three young lambs and evaluated to
   adulthood. Longitudinal ultrasounds document dimensional growth of the
   grafts. The lambs show normal growth, increasing body weight by 366\%
   and graft diameter and volume by 56\% and 216\%, respectively. Explanted
   grafts display physiological strength and stiffness, complete lumen
   endothelialization and extensive population by mature smooth muscle
   cells. The grafts also show substantial elastin deposition and a 465\%
   increase in collagen content, without signs of calcification, aneurysm
   or stenosis. Collectively, our data support somatic growth of this
   completely biological graft.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivity and permittivity of biological tissues are
   important diagnostic parameters and are useful for calculating subject-
   specific specific absorption rate distribution. On the other hand, water
   proton density also has clinical relevance for diagnosis purposes. These
   two kinds of tissue properties are inevitably associated in the
   technique of electrical properties tomography (EPT), which can be used
   to map in vivo electrical properties based on the measured B-1 field
   distribution at Larmor frequency using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   The signal magnitude in MR images is locally proportional to both the
   proton density of tissue and the receive B-1 field; this is a source of
   artifact in receive B-1-based EPT reconstruction because these two
   quantities cannot easily be disentangled. In this study, a new method
   was proposed for simultaneously extracting quantitative conductivity,
   permittivity and proton density from the measured magnitude of transmit
   B-1 field, proton density- weighted receive B-1 field, and transceiver
   phase, in a multi-channel radiofrequency (RF) coil using MRI, without
   specific assumptions to derive the proton density distribution. We
   evaluated the spatial resolution, sensitivity to contrast, and accuracy
   of the method using numerical simulations of B-1 field in a phantom and
   in a realistic human head model. Using the proposed method,
   conductivity, permittivity and proton density were then experimentally
   obtained ex vivo in a pork tissue sample on a 7T MRI scanner equipped
   with a 16-channel microstrip transceiver RF coil.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional semiconductors such as transition-metal dichalcogenides
   (TMDs) are of tremendous interest for scaled logic and memory
   applications. One of the most promising TMDs for scaled transistors is
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and several recent reports have shown
   excellent performance and scalability for MoS2 MOSFETs. An often
   overlooked feature of MoS2, is that its wide band gap (1.8 eV in
   monolayer) and high effective masses should lead to extremely low
   off-state leakage currents. These features could be extremely important
   for dynamic memory applications where the refresh rate is the primary
   factor affecting the power consumption. Theoretical predictions suggest
   that leakage currents in the 10(-18) to 10(-15) A/mu m range could be
   possible, even in scaled transistor geometries. Here, we demonstrate the
   operation of one- and two-transistor dynamic memory circuits using MoS2
   MOSFETs. We characterize the retention times in these circuits and show
   that the two-transistor memory cell reveals MoS2 MOSFETs leakage
   currents as low as 1.7 x 10(-15) A/mu m, a value that is below the noise
   floor of conventional DC measurements. These results have important
   implications for the future use of MOS2 MOSFETs in low-power circuit
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{We report room-temperature resistance changes of up to 30\% under weak
   magnetic fields (0.1 T) for molecular tunnel junctions composed of
   oligophenylene thiol molecules, 1-2, nm in length, sandwiched between
   gold contacts. The magnetoresistance (MR) is independent of field
   orientation and the length of the molecule; it appears to be an
   interface effect. Theoretical analysis suggests that the source of the
   MR is a two-carrier (two-hole) interaction at the interface, resulting
   in spin coupling between the tunneling hole and a localized hole at the
   Au/molecule contact. Such coupling leads to significantly different
   singlet and triplet transmission barriers at the interface. Even weak
   magnetic fields impede spin relaxation processes and thus modify the
   ratio of holes tunneling via the singlet state versus the triplet state,
   which leads to the large MR. Overall, the experiments and analysis
   suggest significant opportunities to explore large MR effects in
   molecular tunnel junctions based on widely available molecules.}},

Abstract = {{Effective impervious area (EIA), or the portion of total impervious area
   (TIA) that is hydraulically connected to the storm sewer system, is an
   important parameter in determining actual urban runoff. EIA has
   implications in watershed hydrology, water quality, environment, and
   ecosystem services. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the
   application of successive weighted least square (WLS) method to urban
   catchments with different sizes and various hydrologic conditions to
   determine EIA fraction. Other objectives are to develop insights on the
   data selection issues, EIA fraction, EIA/TIA ratio, and runoff source
   area patterns in urban catchments. The successive WLS method is applied
   to 50 urban catchments with different sizes from less than 1ha to more
   than 2000ha in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Texas, USA as well as Europe,
   Canada, and Australia. The average, median, and standard deviation of
   EIA fractions for the 42 catchments with residential land uses are found
   to be 0.222, 0.200, and 0.113, respectively. These values for the
   EIA/TIA ratio in the same 42 catchments are 0.50, 0.48, and 0.21,
   respectively. While the EIA/TIA results indicate the importance of EIA,
   95\% prediction interval of the mean EIA/TIA is found to be 0.07 to
   0.93, which shows that using an average value for this ratio in each
   land use to determine EIA from TIA in ungauged urban watersheds can be
   misleading. The successive WLS method was robust and is recommended for
   determining EIA in gauged urban catchments. Copyright (c) 2016 John

Abstract = {{Robust motion control for tracking time-varying reference signals and
   its application to an electrohydraulic camless engine valve actuator is
   presented. Two challenging issues encountered in many engineering
   applications, especially reciprocating machines, are addressed: 1)
   nonlinear system dynamics and 2) time-varying reference signals. Motion
   control of the electrohydraulic camless engine valve actuator is a
   typical example. The electrohydraulic actuator has the critical
   nonlinear dynamic features such as oil flow through the spool valve
   orifice and friction force exerting on the piston. The reference valve
   motion is time-varying since its frequency contents change with the
   engine speed. Prior to studying the time-varying motion control of a
   nonlinear system, the time-invariant case is investigated by means of
   internal model principle. Based on the frequency-domain analysis of a
   nonlinear feedback system, the high-order time-invariant internal model
   is designed for tracking performance. Motivated by the time-invariant
   case, the high-order time-varying internal model is designed for robust
   tracking of time-varying reference signals. The effectiveness of the
   proposed time-varying internal model is demonstrated by application to
   the electrohydraulic camless engine valve actuator.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional inspiratory flow in a double bifurcation airway model}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The flow in an idealized airway model is investigated for the steady
   inhalation case. The geometry consists of a symmetric planar double
   bifurcation that reflects the anatomical proportions of the human
   bronchial tree, and a wide range of physiologically relevant Reynolds
   numbers (Re = 100-5000) is considered. Using magnetic resonance
   velocimetry, we analyze the three-dimensional fields of velocity and
   vorticity, along with flow descriptors that characterize the
   longitudinal and lateral dispersion. In agreement with previous studies,
   the symmetry of the flow partitioning is broken even at the lower
   Reynolds numbers, and at the second bifurcation, the fluid favors the
   medial branches over the lateral ones. This trend reaches a plateau
   around Re = 2000, above which the turbulent inflow results in smoothed
   mean velocity gradients. This also reduces the streamwise momentum flux,
   which is a measure of the longitudinal dispersion by the mean flow. The
   classic Dean-type counter-rotating vortices are observed in the
   first-generation daughter branches as a result of the local curvature.
   In the granddaughter branches, however, the secondary flows are
   determined by the local curvature only for the lower flow regimes (Re <=
   250), in which case the classic Dean mechanism prevails. At higher flow
   regimes, the field is instead dominated by streamwise vortices extending
   from the daughter into the medial granddaughter branches, where they
   rotate in the opposite direction with respect to Dean vortices.
   Circulation and secondary flow intensity show a similar trend as the
   momentum flux, increasing with Reynolds number up to Re = 2000 and then
   dropping due to turbulent dissipation of vorticity. The streamwise
   vortices interact both with each other and with the airway walls, and
   for Re > 500 they can become stronger in the medial granddaughter than
   in the upstream daughter branches. With respect to realistic airway
   models, the idealized geometry produces weaker secondary flows,
   suggesting that realistic anatomical features may generate more lateral
   dispersion than canonical symmetric models.}},

   coatings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{34}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A promising method for forming the absorber layer in copper zinc tin
   sulfide {[}Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS)] thin film solar cells is thermal annealing
   of coatings cast from dispersions of CZTS nanocrystals. Intense pulsed
   light (IPL) annealing utilizing xenon flash lamps is a potential
   high-throughput, low-cost, roll-to-roll manufacturing compatible
   alternative to thermal annealing in conventional furnaces. The authors
   studied the effects of flash energy density (3.9-11.6 J/cm(2)) and
   number of flashes (1-400) during IPL annealing on the microstructure of
   CZTS nanocrystal coatings cast on molybdenum-coated soda lime glass
   substrates (Mo-coated SLG). The annealed coatings exhibited cracks with
   two distinct linear crack densities, 0.01 and 0.2 mu m(-1), depending on
   the flash intensity and total number of flashes. Low density cracking
   (0.01 mu m(-1), similar to 1 crack per 100 mu m) is caused by
   decomposition of CZTS at the Mo-coating interface. Vapor decomposition
   products at the interface cause blisters as they escape the coating.
   Residual decomposition products within the blisters were imaged using
   confocal Raman spectroscopy. In support of this hypothesis, replacing
   the Mo-coated SLG substrate with quartz eliminated blistering and
   low-density cracking. High density cracking is caused by rapid thermal
   expansion and contraction of the coating constricted on the substrate as
   it is heated and cooled during IPL annealing. Finite element modeling
   showed that CZTS coatings on low thermal diffusivity materials (i.e.,
   SLG) underwent significant differential heating with respect to the
   substrate with rapid rises and falls of the coating temperature as the
   flash is turned on and off, possibly causing a build-up of tensile
   stress within the coating prompting cracking. Use of a high thermal
   diffusivity substrate, such as a molybdenum foil (Mo foil), reduces this
   differential heating and eliminates the high-density cracking. IPL
   annealing in presence of sulfur vapor prevented both low-and
   high-density cracking as well as blistering. However, grain growth was
   limited even after annealing with 400 flashes. This lack of grain growth
   is attributed to a difficulty of maintaining high sulfur vapor pressure
   and absence of alkali metal impurities when Mo foil substrates are used.

Abstract = {{The formation, morphology, and pH and ionic strength responses of
   cationic block copolymer micelles in aqueous solutions have been
   examined in detail to provide insight into the future development of
   cationic micelles for complexation with polyanions such as DNA. Diblock
   polymers composed of a hydrophilic/cationic block of
   N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DMAEMA) and a hydrophobic/nonionic
   block of n-butyl methacrylate (BMA) were synthesized {[}denoted as
   DMAEMA-b-BMA (X-Y), where X = DMAEMA molecular weight and Y = molecular
   weight of BMA in kDa]. Four variants were created with block molecular
   weights of 14-13, 14-23, 27-14, 27-29 kDa and low dispersities less than
   1.10. The amphiphilic polymers self-assembled in aqueous conditions into
   coreshell micelles that ranged in size from 25-80 nm. These cationic
   micelles were extensively characterized in terms of size and net charge
   in different buffers over a wide range of ionic strength (0.02-1 M) and
   pH (5-10) conditions. The micelle core is kinetically trapped, and the
   corona contracts with increasing pH and ionic strength, consistent with
   previous work on micelles with glassy polystyrene cores, indicating that
   the corona properties are independent of the dynamics of the micelle
   core. The contraction and extension of the corona scales with solution
   ionic strength and charge fraction of the amine groups. The aggregation
   numbers of the micelles were obtained by static light scattering, and
   the R-g/R-h ratios are close to that of a hard sphere. The zeta
   potentials of the micelles were positive up to two pH units above the
   corona pK(a), suggesting that applications relying on micelle charge for
   stability should be viable over a wide range of solution conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Highly soluble cocrystals can be used to improve bioavailability of a
   poorly soluble drug, through generating supersaturation, when absorption
   is limited by drug dissolution. Dihydromyricetin (DMY) is a
   biopharmaceutics classification system (BCS) IV drug, exhibiting
   dissolution limited absorption. Two novel soluble cocrystals of (+/-)DMY
   with caffeine and urea were prepared, and their physicochemical
   properties were evaluated for suitability in formulation development.
   Although having a much higher solubility than ()DMY, both cocrystals
   undergo rapid precipitation during dissolution and form the poorly
   soluble ()DMY dihydrate in aqueous media. This negates the potential
   advantage offered by the high solubility of the two cocrystals in
   enhancing the dissolution rate and in vivo bioavailability. To solve
   this problem, we have systematically evaluated suitable crystallization
   inhibitors to maintain the supersaturation generated by cocrystal
   dissolution over a prolonged period of time. At 37 degrees C, an
   approximately 5-fold enhancement in oral bioavailability of (+/-)DMY was
   achieved when both cocrystals were dosed with 2.0 mg/mL
   polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 solution than (+/-)DMY dihydrate suspended in
   0.5 mg/mL carboxymethylcellulose sodium solution. This study
   demonstrates that the use of a highly soluble cocrystal along with an
   appropriate crystallization inhibitor is a potentially effective
   formulation strategy for improving oral bioavailability of poorly
   soluble BCS IV drugs.}},

   Efficiency of Spin-Transfer Torque Random Access Memory}},
Journal = {{IEEE ELECTRON DEVICE LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{37}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1108-1111}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A composite free layer spin-transfer torque random access memory
   (STT-RAM) cell is proposed for ultra-high density memory. The structure
   consists of three layers-a high anisotropy interior layer and two low
   anisotropy outer layers that assist the switching of the interior layer
   via exchange coupling. Efficiencies (k(BT)/mu A) of 4.5 and 4.1 are
   achieved for the proposed structure with perpendicular and longitudinal
   anisotropies, respectively. An efficiency of 4.3 is obtained for the
   state-of-the-art single-layer dual-referenced structure with
   perpendicular anisotropy. Simulation of the conventional singlelayer
   structure with perpendicular anisotropy yields an efficiency of 1.6.
   Therefore, the proposed structure with perpendicular anisotropy achieves
   an improvement of 5\% and 181\% relative to the state-of-the-art
   dual-referenced and conventional STT-RAM cells, respectively.
   Furthermore, use of low anisotropy assistive layers enables reduction of
   Gilbert damping and an increase of partial spin polarization within
   those low anisotropy layers-not feasible with single layer structures
   that require high anisotropy for thermal stability. This significantly
   increases perpendicular and longitudinal efficiencies to 8.5 and 6.8,
   respectively. Therefore, this augmented proposed structure with
   perpendicular anisotropy achieves an improvement of 99\% and 446\%
   relative to the state-of-the-art dual-referenced and conventional
   STT-RAM cells, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A pair of universal current mode control schemes for charging a Li-ion
   battery for mobile applications are discussed in this paper. The
   peak-current mode control schemes, based on a single control loop, is
   universal because it is designed with a single-stage buck charger for
   both a conventional wall adapter dc source as well as a solar
   photovoltaic (PV) module of comparable specifications. The charging
   schemes remove the need for an extra MPPT (maximum power point tracking)
   power converter stage. This control scheme is non-linear and
   incorporates all possible scenarios: mode of operation of a battery,
   current charging rate and power characteristic of input source. The
   algorithm uses need-based MPPT and ensures minimal battery discharge,
   and also uses minimum number of sense variables in the circuit. The
   methods differ in the way MPPT is implemented: perturb and observe
   (P\&O) and fractional open circuit voltage. Simulation results
   demonstrating battery charge profile, validity of the algorithm under
   varying insolation conditions and platform workloads are presented,
   along with a discussion of the trade-offs of the two methods.
   Proof-of-concept hardware results are also provided.}},

Abstract = {{We previously showed that long-lived nanoemulsions, seeming initially

   dependence using alkanes with chain lengths ranging from octane to
   hexadecane. The nanostructures of fresh nanoemulsions are imaged with
   cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). We confirm that
   water-continuous microemulsions give simple dispersions of vesicles
   (sometimes unilamellar), typically less than 100 nm in diameter; these
   systems can avoid separation for over 2 months. Selected samples were
   also prepared using halogenated alkanes to create additional contrast in
   the cryo-TEM, allowing us to confirm that the oil is located in the

Volume = {{182}},

Abstract = {{We investigated how forest composition, litter quality, and rainfall
   interact to affect leaf litter decomposition across three successional
   tropical dry forests in Costa Rica. We monitored litter stocks and bulk
   litter turnover in 18 plots that exhibit substantial variation in soil
   characteristics, tree community structure, fungal communities (including
   forests dominated by ecto-or arbuscular mycorrhizal host trees), and
   forest age. Simultaneously, we decomposed three standard litter
   substrates over a 6-month period spanning an unusually intense drought.
   Decay rates of standard substrates depended on the interaction between
   litter identity and forest type. Decomposition rates were correlated
   with tree and soil fungal community composition as well as soil
   fertility, but these relationships differed among litter types. In low
   fertility soils dominated by ectomycorrhizal oak trees, bulk litter
   turnover rates were low, regardless of soil moisture. By contrast, in
   higher fertility soils that supported mostly arbuscular mycorrhizal
   trees, bulk litter decay rates were strongly dependent on seasonal water
   availability. Both measures of decomposition increased with forest age,
   as did the frequency of termite-mediated wood decay. Taken together, our
   results demonstrate that soils and forest age exert strong control over
   decomposition dynamics in these tropical dry forests, either directly
   through effects on microclimate and nutrients, or indirectly by
   affecting tree and microbial community composition and traits, such as
   litter quality.}},

Title = {{The cost of equity: Assessing transit accessibility and social disparity
   using total travel cost}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART A-POLICY AND PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{302-316}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Social equity is increasingly incorporated as a long-term objective into
   urban transportation plans. Researchers use accessibility measures to
   assess equity issues, such as determining the amount of jobs reachable
   by marginalized groups within a defined travel time threshold and
   compare these measures across socioeconomic categories. However,
   allocating public transit resources in an equitable manner is not only
   related to travel time, but also related to the out-of-pocket cost of
   transit, which can represent a major barrier to accessibility for many
   disadvantaged groups. Therefore, this research proposes a set of new
   accessibility measures that incorporates both travel time and transit
   fares. It then applies those measures to determine whether people
   residing in socially disadvantaged neighborhoods in Montreal, Canada
   experience the same levels of transit accessibility as those living in
   other neighborhoods. Results are presented in terms of regional
   accessibility and trends by social indicator decile. Travel time
   accessibility measures estimate a higher number of jobs that can be
   reached compared to combined travel time and cost measures. However, the
   degree and impact of these measures varies across the social deciles.
   Compared to other groups in the region, residents of socially
   disadvantaged areas have more equitable accessibility to jobs using
   transit; this is reflected in smaller decreases in accessibility when
   fare costs are included. Generating new measures of accessibility
   combining travel time and transit fares provides more accurate measures
   that can be easily communicated by transportation planners and engineers
   to policy makers and the public since it translates accessibility
   measures to a dollar value. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Amplicon-based marker gene surveys form the basis of most microbiome and
   other microbial community studies. Such PCR-based methods have multiple
   steps, each of which is susceptible to error and bias. Variance in
   results has also arisen through the use of multiple methods of
   next-generation sequencing (NGS) amplicon library preparation. Here we
   formally characterized errors and biases by comparing different methods
   of amplicon-based NGS library preparation. Using mock community
   standards, we analyzed the amplification process to reveal insights into
   sources of experimental error and bias in amplicon-based microbial
   community and microbiome experiments. We present a method that improves
   on the current best practices and enables the detection of taxonomic
   groups that often go undetected with existing methods.}},

   carrier density of the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in
   SrTiO3/NdTiO3/SrTiO3(001) can be modulated over a wide range. We also
   demonstrate that the NdTiO3 in heterojunctions without a SrTiO3 cap is
   degraded by oxygen absorption from air, resulting in the immobilization
   of donor electrons that could otherwise contribute to the 2DEG. This
   system is, thus, an ideal model to understand and control the
   insulator-to-metal transition in a 2DEG based on both environmental
   conditions and film-growth processing parameters.}},

Abstract = {{This paper described a novel and green approach on catalytic ammonia
   synthesis using non-thermal plasma (NTP). The process studied in this
   paper involves the synthesis and absorption of ammonia under atmospheric
   pressure and low temperature. The effects of operational parameters
   including applied voltage, frequency, gas component and flow rate on
   ammonia synthesis under NTP conditions are studied in this paper. In
   addition, different selected catalysts and absorbents were investigated
   under different conditions of NTP treatment and the ammonia efficiency
   was reported and analyzed. Ru catalyst with carbon nanotube support,
   along with Cs promoter and micro porous absorbents including Molecular
   Sieve 13X and Amberlyst 15 yield the highest ammonia efficiency in this
   process. Results further indicated that frequency and applied voltage of
   10,000 Hz and 6000 V, with N-2:H-2 feed ratio of 3:1 provided the
   optimized efficiency of ammonia synthesis of 2.3 gNH(3)/kWh.}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death in the
   western world. With the current development of clinical diagnostics to
   more accurately measure the extent and specifics of CVDs, a laudable
   goal is a better understanding of the structure-function relation in the
   cardiovascular system. Much of this fundamental understanding comes from
   the development and study of models that integrate biology, medicine,
   imaging, and biomechanics. Information from these models provides
   guidance for developing diagnostics, and implementation of these
   diagnostics to the clinical setting, in turn, provides data for refining
   the models. In this review, we introduce multi-scale and multi-physical
   models for understanding disease development, progression, and designing
   clinical interventions. We begin with multi-scale models of cardiac
   electrophysiology and mechanics for diagnosis, clinical decision
   support, personalized and precision medicine in cardiology with examples
   in arrhythmia and heart failure. We then introduce computational models
   of vasculature mechanics and associated mechanical forces for
   understanding vascular disease progression, designing clinical
   interventions, and elucidating mechanisms that underlie diverse vascular
   conditions. We conclude with a discussion of barriers that must be
   overcome to provide enhanced insights, predictions, and decisions in
   pre-clinical and clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this mini-review, we have critically examined literature aimed at
   understanding the mechanisms to the frequently observed phenomenon of
   loss of tabletability of a powder after dry granulation by slugging or
   roll compaction. Impact of each mechanism on tabletability could be
   explained by considering their influence on either bonding area (BA) or
   bonding strength (BS). For plastically deforming materials, key
   mechanisms that influence tabletability of dry granulated powders
   include lubrication, granule size enlargement, and granule hardening.
   The use of more lubricant leads to lower BS and reduced tabletability.
   Compared to external lubrication, internal lubrication tends to exhibit
   more detrimental effects on tabletability. If extensive fragmentation
   can be avoided, granules with a higher porosity (or lower solid
   fraction) are more deformable under compaction pressure to favor larger
   BA and stronger tablet. For brittle materials, granule hardening can
   still be important despite they are relatively less prone to the
   lubrication problem. Not surprisingly, there is not a single mechanism
   that can explain all observations. The dominating mechanism in each
   specific case depends on material properties and process parameters. We
   have summarized a total of eight important aspects that should be
   addressed when developing a dry granulation (DG) process. We have also
   presented four golden rules to be considered when dealing with the dry
   granulation process. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF QUANTUM ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{52}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The effect of group-velocity dispersion (GVD) and self-phase modulation
   (SPM) on the coherent pulse progression in mid-infrared quantum-cascade
   lasers (QCLs) is investigated. The background saturable absorber (SA)
   effect is included in this paper. In this case, the lasing pulses can be
   built up from the instable continuous wave operation condition related
   to both SA effect and GVD under the influence of a small initial
   disturbance. The theoretical model is built based on the Maxwell-Bloch
   formulism accounting for the couplings among the electric field, the
   polarization, and the population inversion. The pulse evolution in
   time-spatial domains is simulated by the finite difference method with
   prior nondimensionalization, which is necessary for convergent solution.
   It is found that the anomalous GVD, which receives less attention in the
   study of QCL dynamics, can significantly narrow the spectrum splitting
   between side modes. The SPM can broaden the linewidth of the spectral
   modes. Their combined effects can lead the possibility of forming
   solitons.}},

Abstract = {{The dictionary-aided sparse regression (SR) approach has recently
   emerged as a promising alternative to hyperspectral unmixing in remote
   sensing. By using an available spectral library as a dictionary, the SR
   approach identifies the underlying materials in a given hyperspectral
   image by selecting a small subset of spectral samples in the dictionary
   to represent the whole image. A drawback with the current SR
   developments is that an actual spectral signature in the scene is often
   assumed to have zero mismatch with its corresponding dictionary sample,
   and such an assumption is considered too ideal in practice. In this
   paper, we tackle the spectral signature mismatch problem by proposing a
   dictionary-adjusted nonconvex sparsity-encouraging regression (DANSER)
   framework. The main idea is to incorporate dictionary-correcting
   variables in an SR formulation. A simple and low per-iteration
   complexity algorithm is tailor-designed for practical realization of
   DANSER. Using the same dictionary-correcting idea, we also propose a
   robust subspace solution for dictionary pruning. Extensive simulations
   and real-data experiments show that the proposed method is effective in
   mitigating the undesirable spectral signature mismatch effects.}},

Abstract = {{Time-varying renewable energy generation can result in serious
   under-/over-voltage conditions in future distribution grids. Augmenting
   conventional utility-owned voltage regulating equipment with the
   reactive power capabilities of distributed generation units is a viable
   solution. Local control options attaining global voltage regulation
   optimality at fast convergence rates is the goal here. In this context,
   novel reactive power control rules are analyzed under a unifying
   linearized grid model. For single-phase grids, our proximal gradient
   scheme has computational complexity comparable to that of the rule
   suggested by the IEEE 1547.8 standard, but it enjoys well-characterized
   convergence guarantees. Furthermore, adding memory to the scheme results
   in accelerated convergence. For three-phase grids, it is shown that
   reactive power injections have a counter-intuitive effect on bus voltage
   magnitudes across phases. Nevertheless, when our control scheme is
   applied to unbalanced conditions, it is shown to reach an equilibrium
   point. Numerical tests using the IEEE 13-bus, the IEEE 123-bus, and a
   Southern California Edison 47-bus feeder with increased renewable
   penetration verify the properties of the schemes and their resiliency to
   grid topology reconfigurations.}},

Abstract = {{Power spectra separation aims at extracting the individual power spectra
   of multiple emitters from the received mixtures. Traditional spectrum
   sensing for dynamic spectrum sharing is mostly concerned with detecting
   or estimating the aggregate spectrum. Spectra separation can be
   considered as a further step towards full awareness of the radio
   frequency (RF) environment, which may enable judicious routing,
   scheduling and beamforming with more effective interference avoidance.
   In other applications such as geoscience, astronomy, and chemometrics,
   separating the spectra of the objects/analytes from the sensed mixtures
   is also of great interest. Our prior work tackled this problem from a
   tensor decomposition point of view, but this requires delicate and
   careful receiver setups, and the algorithms are computationally heavy
   and difficult to decentralize. In this work, we propose to solve the
   power spectra separation problem using a structured matrix factorization
   model, where the columns of one of the two factor matrices live in the
   unit simplex. The salient features of this new framework are that 1) the
   receivers can be far simpler in terms of hardware, 2) an algebraically
   very simple algorithm can be employed for the centralized case, 3) and
   that effective decentralized algorithms can be devised under this
   framework. Numerical simulations and a laboratory experiment using real
   software-defined radios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the proposed algorithms.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A pipeline right-of-way contaminated with light crude in 1979 and
   subsequently burned shows severe hydrophobicity, poor infiltration
   rates, and loss of vegetative cover. To evaluate alkaline desorption as
   a treatment method, surface soil samples were collected and analyzed
   pre- and post-treatment. Samples had total petroleum hydrocarbon
   concentrations of 2800-63,100 mg/kg, severe water repellency, critical
   moisture 2-5 times above the in situ moisture content, but no acute
   toxicity. Thus, water repellency, rather than toxicity, is causing the
   loss of vegetation. Samples were treated with 0.1 N NaOH in two doses
   (1:3; soil/solution), with complete drainage between doses. Finally,
   each soil sample was washed with an equal volume or water and allowed to
   drain completely. For more hydrophobic samples, repeated treatments,
   without rinsing between each treatment, were made. Post-treatment, the
   samples were re-analyzed for water repellency and critical moisture
   content. In samples with initial water repellency values in the range of
   5.0-6.7 M, the repellency was reduced 94-100 \% and below critical
   levels to avoid soil hydrophobicity in field conditions. The other
   samples with initial water repellency values in the range of 10-13 M
   could not be recovered with single treatment, but sequential treatments
   reduced the hydrocarbon content up to 87 \% and reduced the
   hydrophobicity to levels low enough or nearly low enough to avoid severe
   water repellency in the field. Currently, field studies are being
   carried out to evaluate this treatment method at the site, as a
   stand-alone method and in combination with organic amendment.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND. T cells expressing antigen-specific chimeric antigen
   receptors (CARs) improve outcomes for CD19-expressing B cell
   malignancies. We evaluated a human application of T cells that were
   genetically modified using the Sleeping Beauty (SB)
   transposon/transposase system to express a CD19-specific CAR.
   METHODS. T cells were genetically modified using DNA plasmids from the
   5B platform to stably express a second-generation CD19-specific CAR and
   selectively propagated ex vivo with activating and propagating cells
   (AaPCs) and cytokines. Twenty-six patients with advanced non-Hodgkin
   lymphoma and acute lymphoblastic leukemia safely underwent hematopoietic
   stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and infusion of CART cells as adjuvant
   therapy in the autologous (n = 7) or allogeneic settings (n = 19).
   RESULTS. SB-mediated genetic transposition and stimulation resulted in
   2,200- to 2,500-fold ex vivo expansion of genetically modified T cells,
   with 84\% CAR expression, and without integration hotspots. Following
   autologous HSCT, the 30-month progression-free and overall survivals
   were 83\% and 100\%, respectively. After allogeneic HSCT, the respective
   12-month rates were 53\% and 63\%. No acute or late toxicities and no
   exacerbation of graft-versus-host disease were observed. Despite a low
   antigen burden and unsupportive recipient cytokine environment, CART
   cells persisted for an average of 201 days for autologous recipients and
   51 days for allogeneic recipients.
   CONCLUSIONS. CD19-specific CART cells generated with SB and AaPC
   platforms were safe, and may provide additional cancer control as
   planned infusions after HSCT. These results support further clinical
   development of this nonviral gene therapy approach.}},

Abstract = {{We report surface coverage measurements by Rutherford back scattering
   spectrometry (RBS) of self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of both alkyl
   thiols and oligophenylene thiols on Au-coated mica, Si, and pyrolytic

   primary beam energy, which enhances the He-4(2)2 scattering cross
   section by exciting C-12 nuclear resonance states; this is a submode of
   RBS commonly referred to as nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). The surface
   coverage of C-12 increased linearly with the number of C-12 atoms in
   each SAM. The consistency of the C-12 atom coverage values obtained by
   NRA was cross-checked by measuring the S-32 atom concentration by
   conventional RBS. From these data, we obtained an average coverage of
   3.5 +/- 0.2 molecules/nm(2) for both alkyl thiols and oligophenylene
   thiols on polycrystalline Au surfaces. The results show the utility of
   NRA for quantitative analysis of SAM coverage on Au.}},

Abstract = {{The Gag protein is the main retroviral structural protein, and its
   expression alone is usually sufficient for production of virus-like
   particles (VLPs). In this study, we sought to investigate-in parallel
   comparative analyses-Gag cellular distribution, VLP size, and basic
   morphological features using Gag expression constructs (Gag or Gag-YFP,
   where YFP is yellow fluorescent protein) created from all representative
   retroviral genera: Alpharetrovirus, Betaretrovirus, Deltaretrovirus,
   Epsilonretrovirus, Gammaretrovirus, Lentivirus, and Spumavirus. We
   analyzed Gag cellular distribution by confocal microscopy, VLP budding
   by thinsection transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and general
   morphological features of the VLPs by cryogenic transmission electron
   microscopy (cryo-TEM). Punctate Gag was observed near the plasma
   membrane for all Gag constructs tested except for the representative
   Beta-and Epsilonretrovirus Gag proteins. This is the first report of
   Epsilonretrovirus Gag localizing to the nucleus of HeLa cells. While
   VLPs were not produced by the representative Beta-and Epsilonretrovirus
   Gag proteins, the other Gag proteins produced VLPs as confirmed by TEM,
   and morphological differences were observed by cryo-TEM. In particular,
   we observed Deltaretrovirus-like particles with flat regions of electron
   density that did not follow viral membrane curvature, Lentivirus-like
   particles with a narrow range and consistent electron density,
   suggesting a tightly packed Gag lattice, and Spumavirus-like particles
   with large envelope protein spikes and no visible electron density
   associated with a Gag lattice. Taken together, these parallel
   comparative analyses demonstrate for the first time the distinct
   morphological features that exist among retrovirus-like particles.
   Investigation of these differences will provide greater insights into
   the retroviral assembly pathway.
   IMPORTANCE
   Comparative analysis among retroviruses has been critically important in
   enhancing our understanding of retroviral replication and pathogenesis,
   including that of important human pathogens such as human T-cell
   leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and HIV-1. In this study, parallel
   comparative analyses have been used to study Gag expression and
   virus-like particle morphology among representative retroviruses in the
   known retroviral genera. Distinct differences were observed, which
   enhances current knowledge of the retroviral assembly pathway.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a geographic optimization problem in which we are given a
   region R, a probability density function f(ai...) defined on R, and a
   collection of n utility density functions u (i) (ai...) defined on R.
   Our objective is to divide R into n sub-regions R (i) so as to
   ``balance{''} the overall utilities on the regions, which are given by
   the integrals . Using a simple complementary slackness argument, we show
   that (depending on what we mean precisely by ``balancing{''} the utility
   functions) the boundary curves between optimal sub-regions are level
   curves of either the difference function u (i) (x) - u (j) (x) or the
   ratio u (i) (x)/u (j) (x). This allows us to solve the problem of
   optimally partitioning the region efficiently by reducing it to a
   low-dimensional convex optimization problem. This result generalizes,
   and gives very short and constructive proofs of, several existing
   results in the literature on equitable partitioning for particular forms
   of f(ai...) and u (i) (ai...). We next give two economic applications of
   our results in which we show how to compute a market-clearing price
   vector in an aggregate demand system or a variation of the classical
   Fisher exchange market. Finally, we consider a dynamic problem in which
   the density function f(ai...) varies over time (simulating population
   migration or transport of a resource, for example) and derive a set of
   partial differential equations that describe the evolution of the
   optimal sub-regions over time. Numerical simulations for both static and
   dynamic problems confirm that such partitioning problems become
   tractable when using our methods.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Operating rooms (ORs) in US hospitals are costly to staff, generate
   about 70 \% of a hospital's revenues, and operate at a staffed-capacity
   utilization of 60-70 \%. Many hospitals allocate blocks of OR time to
   individual or groups of surgeons as guaranteed allocation, who book
   surgeries one at a time in their blocks. The booking procedure
   frequently results in unused time between surgeries. Realizing that this
   presents an opportunity to improve OR utilization, hospitals manually
   reschedule surgery start times one or two days before each day of
   surgical operations. The purpose of rescheduling is to decrease OR
   staffing costs, which are determined by the number of concurrently
   staffed ORs. We formulate the rescheduling problem as a variant of the
   bin-packing problem with interrelated items, which are the surgeries
   performed by the same surgeon. We develop a lower bound (LB)
   construction algorithm and prove that the LB is at least (2/3) of the
   optimal staffing cost. A key feature of our approach is that we allow
   hospitals to have two shift lengths. Our analytical results form the
   basis of a branch-and-bound algorithm, which we test on data obtained
   from three hospitals. Experiments show that rescheduling saves
   significant staffing costs.}},

Abstract = {{The use of gas permeable membranes for bubbleless aeration is of
   increasing interest due to the energy savings it affords in wastewater
   treatment applications. However, flow maldistributions are a major
   factor in the impedance of mass transfer efficiency. In this study, the
   effect of module configuration on the hydrodynamic conditions and gas
   transfer properties of various submerged hollow fibre bundles was
   investigated. Flow patterns and velocity profiles within fibre bundles
   were predicted numerically using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and
   the model was validated by tracer-response experiments. In addition, the
   effect of fibre spacing and bundle size on the aeration rate of various
   modules was evaluated experimentally. Previous studies typically base
   performance evaluations on the liquid inlet velocity or an average
   velocity, an approach which neglects the effect of geometric features
   within modules. The use of validated CFD simulations provides more
   detailed information for performance assessment. It was shown that
   specific oxygen transfer rates declines significantly with increasing
   numbers of fibres in a bundle. However, the same trend was not observed
   when the fibre spacing is increased. A correlation was proposed for the
   prediction of the overall mass transfer coefficient utilizing the local
   velocity values obtained from the validated CFD model. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We introduce a parallel machine scheduling problem in which the
   processing times of jobs are not given in advance but are determined by
   a system of linear constraints. The objective is to minimize the
   makespan, i.e., the maximum job completion time among all feasible
   choices. This novel problem is motivated by various real-world
   application scenarios. We discuss the computational complexity and
   algorithms for various settings of this problem. In particular, we show
   that if there is only one machine with an arbitrary number of linear
   constraints, or there is an arbitrary number of machines with no more
   than two linear constraints, or both the number of machines and the
   number of linear constraints are fixed constants, then the problem is
   polynomial-time solvable via solving a series of linear programming
   problems. If both the number of machines and the number of constraints
   are inputs of the problem instance, then the problem is NP-Hard. We
   further propose several approximation algorithms for the latter case.

Abstract = {{Layered complex oxides offer an unusually rich materials platform for
   emergent phenomena through many built-in design knobs such as varied
   topologies, chemical ordering schemes and geometric tuning of the

   Ruddlesden-Popper (RP), A(n+1)BnO(3n+1), thin films by tuning layer
   dimension (n) and strain; however, direct atomic-scale evidence for such
   competing states is currently absent. Using aberration-corrected
   scanning transmission electron microscopy with sub-Angstrom resolution
   in Srn+1TinO3n+1 thin films, we demonstrate the coexistence of
   antiferroelectric, ferroelectric and new ordered and low-symmetry
   phases. We also directly image the atomic rumpling of the rock salt
   layer, a critical feature in RP structures that is responsible for the
   competing phases; exceptional quantitative agreement between electron
   microscopy and density functional theory is demonstrated. The study
   shows that layered topologies can enable multifunctionality through
   highly competitive phases exhibiting diverse phenomena in a single

Abstract = {{Voltage control of magnetization via strain in
   piezoelectric/magnetostrictive systems is a promising mechanism to
   implement energy-efficient straintronic memory devices. Here, we
   demonstrate giant voltage manipulation of MgO magnetic tunnel junctions
   (MTJ) on a Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)(0.7)Ti0.3O3 piezoelectric substrate with (001)
   orientation. It is found that the magnetic easy axis, switching field,
   and the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) of the MTJ can be efficiently
   controlled by strain from the underlying piezoelectric layer upon the
   application of a gate voltage. Repeatable voltage controlled MTJ
   toggling between high/low-resistance states is demonstrated. More
   importantly, instead of relying on the intrinsic anisotropy of the
   piezoelectric substrate to generate the required strain, we utilize
   anisotropic strain produced using a local gating scheme, which is
   scalable and amenable to practical memory applications. Additionally,
   the adoption of crystalline MgO-based MTJ on piezoelectric layer lends
   itself to high TMR in the strain-mediated MRAM devices. Published by AIP

Title = {{Thermoluminescent microparticle thermal history sensors}},
Journal = {{MICROSYSTEMS \& NANOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{AUG 26}},
Abstract = {{While there are innumerable devices that measure temperature, the
   nonvolatile measurement of thermal history is far more difficult,
   particularly for sensors embedded in extreme environments such as fires
   and explosions. In this review, an extensive analysis is given of one
   such technology: thermoluminescent microparticles. These are transparent
   dielectrics with a large distribution of trap states that can store
   charge carriers over very long periods of time. In their simplest form,
   the population of these traps is dictated by an Arrhenius expression,
   which is highly dependent on temperature. A particle with filled traps
   that is exposed to high temperatures over a short period of time will
   preferentially lose carriers in shallow traps. This depopulation leaves
   a signature on the particle luminescence, which can be used to determine
   the temperature and time of the thermal event. Particles are
   prepared-many months in advance of a test, if desired-by exposure to
   deep ultraviolet, X-ray, beta, or gamma radiation, which fills the traps
   with charge carriers. Luminescence can be extracted from one or more
   particles regardless of whether or not they are embedded in debris or
   other inert materials. Testing and analysis of the method is
   demonstrated using laboratory experiments with microheaters and high
   energy explosives in the field. It is shown that the thermoluminescent
   materials LiF:Mg,Ti, MgB4O7:Dy,Li, and CaSO4:Ce,Tb, among others,
   provide accurate measurements of temperature in the 200 to 500 degrees C
   range in a variety of high-explosive environments.}},

Abstract = {{The Sleeping Beauty transposon (SB-Tn) system is being used widely as a
   DNA vector for the delivery of therapeutic transgenes, as well as a tool
   for the insertional mutagenesis in animal models. In order to accurately
   assess the insertional potential and properties related to the
   integration of SB it is essential to determine the copy number of SB-Tn
   in the host genome. Recently developed SB100X transposase has
   demonstrated an integration rate that was much higher than the original
   SB10 and that of other versions of hyperactive SB transposases, such as
   HSB3 or HSB17. In this study, we have constructed a series of SB vectors
   carrying either a DsRed or a human beta-globin transgene that was
   encompassed by cHS4 insulator elements, and containing the SB100X
   transposase gene outside the SB-Tn unit within the same vector in cis
   configuration. These SB-Tn constructs were introduced into the K-562
   erythroid cell line, and their presence in the genomes of host cells was
   analyzed by Southern blot analysis using non-radioactive probes. Many
   copies of SB-Tn insertions were detected in host cells regardless of
   transgene sequences or the presence of cHS4 insulator elements.
   Interestingly, the size difference of 2.4 kb between insulated SB and
   non-insulated controls did not reflect the proportional difference in
   copy numbers of inserted SB-Tns. We then attempted methylation-sensitive
   Southern blots to assess the potential influence of cHS4 insulator
   elements on the epigenetic modification of SB-Tn. Our results indicated
   that SB100X was able to integrate at multiple sites with the number of
   SB-Tn copies larger than 6 kb in size. In addition, the nonradioactive
   Southern blot protocols developed here will be useful to detect
   integrated SB-Tn copies in any mammalian cell type. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{Dynamics of nitrogen dissociation from direct molecular simulation}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{1}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{We present a molecular-level investigation of nitrogen dissociation at
   high temperature. The computational technique, called direct molecular
   simulation (DMS), solely relies on an ab initio potential energy surface
   and both N-2 + N-2 and N + N-2 processes are simulated as they
   concurrently take place in an evolving nonequilibrium gas system.
   Quasiclassical trajectory calculations (QCT) reveal that dissociation
   rate coefficients calculated at thermal equilibrium, i.e., assuming
   Boltzmann energy distributions, are approximately equal (within less
   than 15\%) for both N-2 + N-2 and N + N-2 collisions for the range of
   temperatures considered. The DMS (nonequilibrium) results indicate,
   however, that the presence of atomic nitrogen significantly affects the
   dissociation rate of molecular nitrogen, but indirectly. In fact, the
   presence of atomic nitrogen causes an important reduction of the
   vibrational relaxation time of N-2, by almost one order of magnitude.
   This, in turn, speeds up the replenishment of high-v states that are
   otherwise significantly depleted if only N-2 + N-2 collisions are
   considered. Because of the strong favoring of dissociation from high-v
   states, this results in dissociation rates that are 2-3 times higher
   when significant atomic nitrogen is present compared to systems composed
   of mainly diatomic nitrogen, such as during the initial onset of
   dissociation. Specifically, we find that exchange events occur
   frequently during N + N-2 collisions and that such exchange collisions
   constitute an effective mechanism of scrambling the internal energy
   states, resulting in multiquantum jumps in vibrational energy levels
   that effectively promote energy transfers. The resulting vibrational
   relaxation time constant we calculate for N + N-2 collisions is
   significantly lower than the widely used Millikan-White model.
   Significant discrepancies are found between predictions of the Park
   two-temperature model (using the Millikan-White vibrational relaxation
   model) and the DMS results for dissociating nitrogen systems involving
   both atomic and molecular nitrogen. Such direct comparisons also
   illustrate how the DMS method is able to reveal all relevant
   nonequilibrium physics without the need to compute large numbers of
   state-transition probabilities. In this manner, DMS presents an accurate
   and tractable approach to construct models for direct-simulation Monte
   Carlo and computational fluid dynamics simulations from first
   principles.}},

Volume = {{107}},
Pages = {{194-206}},

Abstract = {{This investigation is concerned with the thermal and fluid flow design
   of a double-pipe heat exchanger in which the wall of the inner pipe is
   helically corrugated. In this arrangement, the inner tube is
   geometrically unique since it is comprised of alternating ridges and
   grooves. By means of the continuous helical twist, the pipe wall creates
   a swirl flow component superimposed on an axial flow within both fluid
   streams. Steady numerical simulations were used as the design tool.
   Results were obtained for both parallel and counter flow, and for both
   constant- and variable-fluid property models. Two thermal-hydraulic
   models were employed. In one, the heat exchanger was analyzed as a
   single end-to-end entity. In the other, a spatially periodic model was
   created to obtain generally applicable thermal resistance results.
   Comparisons with simple smooth-walled double-pipe exchangers showed
   roughly a factor of three increases in heat transfer for the helically
   corrugated double-pipe heat exchangers. The corresponding comparison of
   the pressure drops revealed the corrugated double-pipe heat exchangers
   had anywhere from a factor of two to four larger pressure drop. These
   comparisons correspond to the two compared cases having the same
   perimeters of the participating pipes. Counter-flow operation yielded
   higher rates of heat transfer, but to an extent that depends on whether
   the fluid properties are temperature-dependent or constant. Reynolds
   numbers for the investigated cases ranged from 420 to 2000. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{High-spin iron(IV)-oxo compounds are known to activate strong C-H bonds.
   Stabilizing the high-spin S = 2 electronic configuration is difficult in
   molecular species for homogeneous catalysis, but recent experimental and
   computational results suggest this can be achieved in the metal-organic
   framework Fe-2(dobdc) (dobdc(4-) = 2,5-dioxido-1,4-benzenedicarboxylate)
   and its magnesium-diluted analogues. With a novel computational
   screening approach, we have identified three additional frameworks that
   are predicted to form high-spin iron(IV)-oxo species upon dissociative
   adsorption of nitrous oxide. The computational work is supported by
   follow-up experiments which show that, among these three materials,
   Fe-BTT (BTT3- = 1,3,5-benzenetristetrazolate) selectively oxidizes
   ethane to ethanol at 120 degrees C. Subsequent spectroscopic and cycling
   studies suggest that framework defects, rather than the bulk framework
   or extraframework sites, are likely responsible for the observed
   reactivity. This work shows how computational methods can be used to
   rapidly identify promising candidate frameworks, and highlights the need
   for new methods that allow defect sites in metal-organic frameworks to
   be better understood and exploited for catalysis.}},

Abstract = {{In the study of LaFeAsO and doped compounds thereof, high-resolution
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been used to characterize the
   structural and morphological properties, while cryo-TEM has been used to
   purportedly observe the structural phase transition occurring at 160 K.
   Often, the appearance and disappearance of Bragg spots in diffraction
   patterns, as well as changes in diffraction contrast in bright-field
   images, have been pointed to as indicators of the phase transition. Here
   we show that effects not related to the transition can produce
   signatures reminiscent of those typically associated with the symmetry
   change. In particular, we demonstrate the effects of electron channeling
   and multiple scattering on intensity modulation of atomic columns and
   Bragg spots in high-angle annular dark-field scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM)
   images and parallel-beam electron diffraction (PBED) patterns,
   respectively, from both tetragonal and orthorhombic LaFeAsO. From
   electron-transparent lamellae, we quantify the spatially varying
   thickness and, via atomic-resolution HAADF-STEM imaging, demonstrate the
   thickness-dependent modulation of intensities within the (Fe,O) and (La,
   As) columns at 300 K. From PBED patterns and Fourier-filtered
   high-resolution bright field images acquired both above and below the
   structural phase-transition temperature, we show how intensities of
   forbidden reflections are modulated by moving to regions of differing
   thickness, independent of a symmetry change (i.e., at a fixed
   temperature). The experimental results are supported with multislice
   simulations of thickness-dependent atomic-column contrast and Bragg-spot
   intensities.}},

Abstract = {{Ammonia is normally made at high temperature and pressure using a
   promoted iron catalyst. High temperatures are needed to get fast
   kinetics; the high pressure is used to ensure high conversion.
   Alternatively, ammonia can be made at high temperature but lower
   pressure if the product ammonia is rapidly separated. Here, we have
   systematically studied the effect of temperature and pressure on the
   rates of reaction. We then have qualitatively investigated the
   absorptive separation of ammonia using calcium chloride in a reaction
   separation process. Rapid separation reduces the constraint of
   reversible reaction and enables us to obtain appropriate reaction rates
   at relatively lower pressure. The effect of different operating
   conditions reaction temperature, pressure, absorption temperature, and
   gas transport on production rates is carefully measured, and this
   elucidates the potential and the limits of this type of low-pressure
   ammonia synthesis.}},

Month = {{AUG 24}},
Abstract = {{We study the magnetic response of a ferromagnetic bilayer with
   antiferromagnetic coupling, where the layers experience magnetostrictive
   strains and epitaxial misfit strains. These strains cause the layers to
   stretch and bend as the magnetic spins of the layers rotate, resulting
   in elastic energy that adds to the magnetic energy of the system. The
   magnetic and elastic energies are computed as a function of spin
   direction in each layer for a given set of material and geometric
   parameters. By finding the rotations that minimize the total energy, we
   compute magnetic hysteresis loops for different combinations of magnetic
   and elastic parameters. The elastic contribution is reflected in the
   transitions at the corners of the hysteresis curves as well as in the
   coercive field of the main loop. The details of the elastic contribution
   depend in a complicated way on the magnetostriction of the layers, the
   epitaxial strain, the magnetic anisotropies, and the system geometry.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of alpha `'-Fe16N2 Compound Anisotropic Magnet by the
   Strained-Wire Method}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW APPLIED}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{AUG 18}},
Abstract = {{alpha{''}-Fe16N2 is considered as one of the most promising candidates
   for future rare-earth-free magnets, showing the highest saturation
   magnetization reported so far. We propose and demonstrate a
   ``strained-wire method{''} to synthesize alpha{''}-Fe16N2 compound
   anisotropic magnets with an enhanced hard magnetic property, with a
   direct experimental observation of the intercoupling between tensile
   strain and the martensitic phase transition. The principle is helpful
   for the generation of another martensitic phase. In this paper, the
   method is demonstrated on an alpha{''}-Fe16N2 compound permanent magnet
   preparation by starting from pure bulk iron, with urea as the nitrogen
   provider. A uniaxial tensile stress is applied on the wire-shaped sample
   during the postannealing stage, producing a promising permanent magnet
   with a hard magnet property which lacks any rare-earth elements. The
   sample synthesized in the lab exhibits a coercivity of 1220 Oe and an
   energy product of up to 9 MGOe. The mechanism of the strained-wire
   method is analyzed based on scanning-transmission-electron-microscopy
   characterizations of samples with different strains. We observe a
   strain-induced recrystallization of alpha{''}-Fe16N2 samples at a low
   annealing temperature (150 degrees C). We demonstrate that this
   strained-wire method can be used on alpha{''}-Fe16N2 samples to increase
   the alpha{''}-Fe16N2 phase-volume ratio and to fine-tune its
   microstructure at a low temperature. Some further characterization
   results are also included in this paper. The physics of the influence of
   tensile stress on the martensitic phase transition is discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation is a problem of significance in
   many applications. In practice, due to the occurrence of coherent
   signals and/or when the number of available snapshots is small, it is a
   challenge to find DOAs accurately. This problem is revisited here
   through a new enhanced principal-singular- vector utilization for modal
   analysis (EPUMA) DOA estimation approach, which improves the threshold
   performance by first generating (P + K) DOA candidates for K sources
   where P >= K, and then judiciously selecting K of them. The asymptotic
   variance of EPUMA is theoretically derived, and numerical results are
   provided to validate the asymptotic analysis and illustrate the
   practical merits of EPUMA.}},

Title = {{Influence of the surface termination on the light emission of
   crystalline silicon nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{32}},
Month = {{AUG 12}},
Abstract = {{The light emission properties of silicon crystalline nanoparticles
   (SiNPs) have been investigated using steady-state and time-resolved
   photoluminescence measurements carried out at 12 K and at room
   temperature. To enable a comparative study of the role of surface
   terminal groups on the optical properties, we investigated SiNPs-H
   ensembles with the same mean NP diameter but differing on the surface
   termination, namely organic-functionalized with 1-dodecene (SiNPs-C12)
   and H-terminated (SiNPs-H). We show that although the spectral
   dependence of the light emission is rather unaffected by surface
   termination, characterized by a single broad band peaking at similar to
   1.64 eV, both the exciton recombination lifetimes and quantum yields
   display a pronounced dependence on the surface termination. Exciton
   lifetimes and quantum yields are found to be significantly lower in
   SiNPs-H compared SiNPs-C12. This difference is due to distinct
   non-radiative recombination probabilities resulting from inter-NP
   exciton migration, which in SiNPs-C12 is inhibited by the energy
   barriers imposed by the bulky surface groups. The surface groups of
   organic-terminated SiPs are responsible for the inhibition of inter-NP
   exciton transfer, yielding a higher quantum yield compared to SiNPs-H.
   The surface oxidation of SiNPs-C12 leads to the appearance of a
   phenomenon of an exciton transference from to the Si core to
   oxide-related states that contribute to light emission. These excitons
   recombine radiatively, explaining why the emission quantum of the
   organic-terminated SiNPs is the same after surface oxidation of
   SiNPs-C12.}},

Abstract = {{We report the observation of ferromagnetic resonance-driven spin pumping
   signals at room temperature in three-dimensional topological insulator
   thin films-Bi2Se3 and (Bi, Sb)(2)Te-3-deposited by molecular beam
   epitaxy on Y3Fe5O12 thin films. By systematically varying the Bi2Se3
   film thickness, we show that the spin-charge conversion efficiency,
   characterized by the inverse Rashba-Edelstein effect length
   (lambda(IREE)), increases dramatically as the film thickness is
   increased from two quintuple layers, saturating above six quintuple
   layers. This suggests a dominant role of surface states in spin and
   charge interconversion in topological-insulator-ferromagnet
   heterostructures. Our conclusion is further corroborated by studying a
   series of Y3Fe5O12/(Bi, Sb)(2)Te-3 heterostructures. Finally, we use the
   ferromagnetic resonance linewidth broadening and the inverse
   Rashba-Edelstein signals to determine the effective interfacial spin
   mixing conductance and lambda(IREE).}},

Abstract = {{The importance of methane conversion, syngas selectivity, and oxidizer
   conversion for efficient syngas production by the partial oxidation of
   methane using a metal oxide redox cycle is quantified. The operating
   conditions which enable high conversion of methane to syngas over cerium
   oxide and conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide in the
   subsequent oxidation reaction are identified experimentally. The
   parametric study considers operating temperatures of 900 and 1000
   degrees C and methane flow rates from 1 to 15 mL min(-1) g(-1) in a
   fixed bed of porous ceria particles. The reduced ceria is reoxidized in
   a flow of 10 mL min(-1) g(-1) CO2, to produce CO. A trade-off of
   achieving high methane conversion is observed. For example, at 1000
   degrees C, the cycle-averaged methane conversion increases from 13\% for
   reduction in 15 mL min(-1) g(-1) to 60\% in 1 mL min(-1) g(-1). For the
   same change in methane flow rate, the cycle-averaged selectivities
   decrease from 78\% to 39\% (CO) and 77\% to 40\% (H-2) and the oxidizer
   conversion decreases from 93\% to 48\%. The maximum projected
   solar-to-fuel thermal efficiency is 27\% for cycling at 1000 degrees C
   with reduction in 5 mL min(-1) g(-1) methane. (C) 2016 Hydrogen Energy

Title = {{Defects, stoichiometry, and electronic transport in SrTiO3-delta
   epilayers: A high pressure oxygen sputter deposition study}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{120}},
Number = {{5}},

Abstract = {{SrTiO3 is not only of enduring interest due to its unique dielectric,
   structural, and lattice dynamical properties, but is also the archetypal
   perovskite oxide semiconductor and a foundational material in oxide
   heterostructures and electronics. This has naturally focused attention
   on growth, stoichiometry, and defects in SrTiO3, one exciting recent
   development being such precisely stoichiometric defect-managed thin
   films that electron mobilities have finally exceeded bulk crystals. This
   has been achieved only by molecular beam epitaxy, however (and to a
   somewhat lesser extent pulsed laser deposition (PLD)), and numerous open
   questions remain. Here, we present a study of the stoichiometry,
   defects, and structure in SrTiO3 synthesized by a different method, high
   pressure oxygen sputtering, relating the results to electronic
   transport. We find that this form of sputter deposition is also capable
   of homoepitaxy of precisely stoichiometric SrTiO3, but only provided
   that substrate and target preparation, temperature, pressure, and
   deposition rate are carefully controlled. Even under these conditions,
   oxygen-vacancy-doped heteroepitaxial SrTiO3 films are found to have
   carrier density, mobility, and conductivity significantly lower than
   bulk. While surface depletion plays a role, it is argued from
   particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) measurements of trace impurities
   in commercial sputtering targets that this is also due to deep acceptors
   such as Fe at 100's of parts-per-million levels. Comparisons of PIXE

Abstract = {{Despite the importance of examining the formation of nanoparticle
   protein conjugates, there is a dearth of routine techniques for
   nanoparticle protein conjugate characterization. The most prominent
   change to a nanoparticle population upon conjugate formation is a shift
   in the nanoparticle size distribution function. However, commonly
   employed dynamic light scattering based approaches for size distribution
   characterization are ineffective for non-monodisperse samples, and
   further they are relatively insensitive to size shifts of only several
   nanometers, which are common during conjugate formation. Conversely, gas
   phase ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) techniques can be used to reliably
   examine polydisperse samples, and are sensitive to similar to 1 nm size
   distribution function shifts; the challenge with IMS is to convert
   nanoparticle protein conjugates to aerosol particles without bringing
   about nonspecific aggregation or conjugate formation. Except in limited
   circumstances, electrospray based aerosolization has proven difficult to
   apply for this purpose. Here we show that via liquid nebulization (LN)
   with online, high-flow-rate dilution (with dilution factors up to 10
   000) it is possible to aerosolize nanoparticle protein conjugates,
   enabling IMS measurements of their conjugate size distribution
   functions. We specifically employ the LN-IMS system to examine bovine
   serum albumin binding to gold nanoparticles. Inferred maximum protein
   surface coverages (similar to 0.025 nm(-2)) from measurements are shown
   to be in excellent agreement with reported values for gold from quartz
   crystal microbalance measurements. It is also shown that LN-IMS
   measurements can be used to detect size distribution function shifts on
   the order of 1 nm, even in circumstances where the size distribution
   function itself has a standard deviation of similar to 5 nm, In total,
   the reported measurements suggest that LN-IMS is a potentially simple
   and robust technique for nanoparticle-protein conjugate
   characterization.}},

Abstract = {{The production of cellulosic biofuels often leaves behind solid
   residues, which can be converted to useful co-products via chemical
   modification and processing. The objective of this study was to examine
   the changes in hydroxyl accessibility of a hardwood after the extraction
   of fermentable sugars (saccharification). Saccharification was performed
   on milled and dilute-acid pretreated aspen wood and resulted in a
   glucan-to-glucose conversion of 91\%. The unhydrolyzed (solid) fraction
   was then analyzed for hydroxyl availability using an acetylation method,
   and the data were related to information of accessible pore volume
   evaluated using nitrogen adsorption. Different pore volumes were also
   created by oven-, air-, or freeze-drying of the samples. The results
   showed that more hydroxyls are available if the physical accessibility
   (pore volume) of a given substrate is better preserved. Upon
   saccharification, the accessible hydroxyls were reduced by at least half
   of that in untreated wood, while the specific pore volume increased 10
   times. This finding suggests that future strategies for utilizing
   saccharification residues for co-products should tap the increased
   porosity and lower polarity of the substrate.}},

Title = {{Action of the diaphragm on the rib cage}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{121}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{391-400}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{When the diaphragm contracts, pleural pressure falls, exerting a caudal
   and inward force on the entire rib cage. However, the diaphragm also
   exerts forces in the cranial and outward direction on the lower ribs.
   One of these forces, the ``insertional force,{''} is applied by the
   muscle at its attachments to the lower ribs. The second, the ``
   appositional force,{''} is due to the transmission of abdominal pressure
   to the lower rib cage in the zone of apposition. In the control
   condition at functional residual capacity, the effects of these two
   forces on the lower ribs are nearly equal and outweigh the effect of
   pleural pressure, whereas for the upper ribs, the effect of pleural
   pressure is greater. The balance between these effects, however, may be
   altered. When the abdomen is given a mechanical support, the insertional
   and appositional forces are increased, so that the muscle produces a
   larger expansion of the lower rib cage and, with it, a smaller
   retraction of the upper rib cage. In contrast, at higher lung volumes
   the zone of apposition is decreased, and pleural pressure is the
   dominant force on the lower ribs as well. Consequently, although the
   force exerted by the diaphragm on these ribs remains inspiratory, rib
   displacement is reversed into a caudal-inward displacement. This
   mechanism likely explains the inspiratory retraction of the lateral
   walls of the lower rib cage observed in many subjects with chronic
   obstructive pulmonary disease (Hoover's sign). These observations
   support the use of a three-compartment, rather than a two-compartment,
   model to describe chest wall mechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the number of eigenvalues located in a given interval of a
   large sparse Hermitian matrix is an important problem in certain
   applications, and it is a prerequisite of eigensolvers based on a
   divide-and-conquer paradigm. Often, an exact count is not necessary, and
   methods based on stochastic estimates can be utilized to yield rough
   approximations. This paper examines a number of techniques tailored to
   this specific task. It reviews standard approaches and explores new ones
   based on polynomial and rational approximation filtering combined with a
   stochastic procedure. We also discuss how the latter method is
   particularly well-suited for the FEAST eigensolver. Copyright (C) 2016

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a robust preconditioner for general sparse
   matrices based on low-rank approximations of the Schur complement in a
   Domain Decomposition framework. In this `Schur Low Rank' preconditioning
   approach, the coefficient matrix is first decoupled by a graph
   partitioner, and then a low-rank correction is exploited to compute an
   approximate inverse of the Schur complement associated with the
   interface unknowns. The method avoids explicit formation of the Schur
   complement. We show the feasibility of this strategy for a model problem
   and conduct a detailed spectral analysis for the relation between the
   low-rank correction and the quality of the preconditioner. We first
   introduce the SLR preconditioner for symmetric positive definite
   matrices and symmetric indefinite matrices if the interface matrices are
   symmetric positive definite. Extensions to general symmetric indefinite
   matrices as well as to nonsymmetric matrices are also discussed.
   Numerical experiments on general matrices illustrate the robustness and
   efficiency of the proposed approach. Copyright (C) 2016 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{Terahertz metamaterials (THz MMs) have been proven to be good candidates
   for chemical, biological, temperature, strain, and position sensing.
   However, currently developed thin-metal-film-based split ring resonator
   (SRR) MMs have relatively low quality factor (Q-factors), leading to a
   poor sensitivity, which is one of the obstacles for development of
   sensors. In order to enhance the Q-factor, novel THz MMs,
   nanopillar-based MMs, are designed, fabricated, and characterized. The
   nanopillar-based MMs excite the inductive-capacitive resonance via
   desplacement currents, showing a significantly enhanced Q-factor around
   450, which is about 30 times higher than typical thin-metal-film-based
   MMs. Nanopillar-based MMs also show 17 times larger frequency shift
   compared to the metal-film-based MMs when the permittivity of the
   ambient dielectric properties of the MMs changes. Due to high Q-factor
   and large frequency shift, the nanopillar-based THz MMs utilizing
   displacement current have great potential for highly sensitive chemical
   and biomaterial detection as well as frequency-agile THz devices.}},

Abstract = {{Protein ligand charge can impact physiological delivery with charge
   reduction often benefiting performance. Yet neutralizing mutations can
   be detrimental to protein function. Herein, three approaches are
   evaluated to introduce charged-to-neutral mutations of three cations and
   three anions within an affibody engineered to bind epidermal growth
   factor receptor. These approaches-combinatorial library sorting or
   consensus design, based on natural homologs or library-sorted
   mutants-are used to identify mutations with favorable affinity,
   stability, and recombinant yield. Consensus design, based on 942
   affibody homologs, yielded a mutant of modest function (K-d = 11 +/- 4
   nM, T-m = 62 degrees C, and yield = 4.0 +/- 0.8 mg/L as compared to 5.3
   +/- 1.7 nM, 71 degrees C, and 3.5 +/- 0.3 mg/L for the parental
   affibody). Extension of consensus design to 10 additional mutants
   exhibited varied performance including a substantially improved mutant
   (K-d = 6.9 +/- 1.4 nM, T-m = 71 degrees C, and 12.7 +/- 0.9 mg/L yield).
   Sorting a homolog-based combinatorial library of 7 x 10(5) mutants
   generated a distribution of mutants with lower stability and yield, but
   did identify one strongly binding variant (K-d = 1.2 +/- 0.3 nM, T-m =
   69 degrees C, and 6.0 +/- 0.4 mg/L yield). Synthetic consensus design,
   based on the amino acid distribution in functional library mutants,
   yielded higher affinities (P = 0.05) with comparable stabilities and
   yields. The best of four analyzed clones had K-d = 1.7 +/- 0.5 nM, T-m =
   68 degrees C, and 7.0 +/- 0.5 mg/L yield. While all three approaches
   were effective in creating targeted affibodies with six
   charged-to-neutral mutations, synthetic consensus design proved to be
   the most robust. Synthetic consensus design provides a valuable tool for
   ligand engineering, particularly in the context of charge manipulation.

Abstract = {{The ability to predict tableting properties of a powder mixture from
   individual components is of both fundamental and practical importance to
   the efficient formulation development of tablet products. A common
   tableting classification system (TCS) of binary powder mixtures
   facilitates the systematic development of new knowledge in this
   direction. Based on the dependence of tablet tensile strength on weight
   fraction in a binary mixture, three main types of tableting behavior are
   identified. Each type is further divided to arrive at a total of 15
   sub-classes. The proposed classification system lays a framework for a
   better understanding of powder interactions during compaction. Potential
   applications and limitations of this classification system are

Abstract = {{Technology foresight is usually conducted by government or industry
   associations and can serve to provide companies with information on
   critical technologies that a country or industry intends to develop in
   the next ten to twenty years. For individual companies to benefit from
   foresight results and transform them into specific technology
   development plans, the relationships between the desired technologies
   and the dynamic business environment need to be understood. In this
   article, an innovation diffusion model implemented via system dynamics
   simulation is used to operationalize the link between foresight and
   planning. It helps company decision makers visualize the diffusion
   process of the innovation inhabiting the chosen technology and determine
   the critical parameters quantitatively through experiments and analysis.
   Using these results, possible paths leading to the desired future of the
   chosen technology can be generated and plans be prepared to guide the
   effective development of the technology, essential infrastructure, and
   key applications. An example is presented at the end to illustrate the
   application of the proposed method that helps a Chinese service carrier
   to plan for its 4G wireless communication network expansion. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Silica gel microspheres are ideal materials for bioencapsulation due to
   their mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and stability.
   Encapsulated cells are isolated from the environment and protected from

   not well established. This paper describes a method for the production
   of monodisperse silicon alkoxide cross-linked silica nanoparticle (SNP)
   gel microspheres for bioencapsulation in which silica gel precursor is
   extruded from a needle into a cross-flowing stream of mineral oil.
   Microspheres produced ranged from 1.3 to 2.9mm in diameter with
   coefficients of variation ranging from 2 to 6\%. Microsphere size was
   mainly controlled by the flowrate of the cross-flowing oil and smaller
   microspheres generally had larger coefficients of variation. The method
   described in this paper can be optimised to produce silica gel
   microspheres with a diverse range of compositions and properties.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Compared with a hash table, a Bloom filter (BF) is more space efficient
   for supporting fast matching through a controllable and acceptable false
   positive probability. The space size of the basic BF is predetermined
   based on the expected number of elements to be stored. However, we
   cannot predict the space scale of a BF for dynamic sets. It is still
   challenging for the two existing solutions, scalable BF (SBF) and
   dynamic BF (DBF), to manipulate dynamic data sets with low memory
   overhead but achieving high performance. This article presents a
   partitioned BF (Par-BF) for dynamic data sets. Compared with DBF and
   SBF, Par-BF is able to leverage a sweet spot between high performance
   and low overhead by a group of formulas to support fast concurrent
   matching. Specifically, the size and the range of the false positive
   probability in Par-BF can be deliberately derived. From our trace-driven
   experimental results, the input/output operations per second of Par-BF
   outperforms that of DBF and SBF by 10x to 14x and by 3x to 8x,
   respectively. Besides, through our proposed garbage collection policy,
   Par-BF consumes less than half of the memory usage of SBF.}},

Title = {{Carpooling Service for Large-Scale Taxicab Networks}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Carpooling has long held the promise of reducing gas consumption by
   decreasing mileage to deliver coriders. Although ad hoc carpools already
   exist in the real world through private arrangements, little research on
   the topic has been done. In this article, we present the first
   systematic work to design, implement, and evaluate a carpool service,
   called coRide, in a large-scale taxicab network intended to reduce total
   mileage for less gas consumption. Our coRide system consists of three
   components, a dispatching cloud server, passenger clients, and an
   onboard customized device, called TaxiBox. In the coRide design, in
   response to the delivery requests of passengers, dispatching cloud
   servers calculate cost-efficient carpool routes for taxicab drivers and
   thus lower fares for the individual passengers.
   To improve coRide's efficiency in mileage reduction, we formulate an
   NP-hard route calculation problem under different practical constraints.
   We then provide (1) an optimal algorithm using Linear Programming, (2) a
   2-approximation algorithm with a polynomial complexity, and (3) its
   corresponding online version with a linear complexity. To encourage
   coRide's adoption, we present a win-win fare model as the incentive
   mechanism for passengers and drivers to participate. We test the
   performance of coRide by a comprehensive evaluation with a real-world
   trial implementation and a data-driven simulation with 14,000 taxi data
   from the Chinese city Shenzhen. The results show that compared with the
   ground truth, our service can reduce 33\% of total mileage; with our
   win-win fare model, we can lower passenger fares by 49\% and
   simultaneously increase driver profit by 76\%.}},

   Test Adequacy Coverage}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING AND METHODOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{25}},

Abstract = {{Test adequacy metrics defined over the structure of a program, such as
   Modified Condition and Decision Coverage (MC/DC), are used to assess
   testing efforts. However, MC/DC can be ``cheated{''} by restructuring a
   program to make it easier to achieve the desired coverage. This is
   concerning, given the importance of MC/DC in assessing the adequacy of
   test suites for critical systems domains. In this work, we have explored
   the impact of implementation structure on the efficacy of test suites
   satisfying the MC/DC criterion using four real-world avionics systems.
   Our results demonstrate that test suites achieving MC/DC over
   implementations with structurally complex Boolean expressions are
   generally larger and more effective than test suites achieving MC/DC
   over functionally equivalent, but structurally simpler, implementations.
   Additionally, we found that test suites generated over simpler
   implementations achieve significantly lower MC/DC and fault-finding
   effectiveness when applied to complex implementations, whereas test
   suites generated over the complex implementation still achieve high
   MC/DC and attain high fault finding over the simpler implementation. By
   measuring MC/DC over simple implementations, we can significantly reduce
   the cost of testing, but in doing so, we also reduce the effectiveness
   of the testing process. Thus, developers have an economic incentive to
   ``cheat{''} the MC/DC criterion, but this cheating leads to negative
   consequences. Accordingly, we recommend that organizations require MC/DC
   over a structurally complex implementation for testing purposes to avoid
   these consequences.}},

   microscopy with a heated stage for in situ measurements, followed by
   atomic force microscopy and X-ray diffraction. During annealing, the
   film undergoes transitions from predominant growth of a polycrystalline
   triclinic crystal structure to single crystal orthorhombic, followed by
   polycrystalline growth of the orthorhombic polymorph. Observation of
   crystal morphology with time allows determination of the crystal
   orientation, which is used in conjunction with crystal size measurements
   to determine the crystallization activation energies for the observed
   growth phases and crystal planes.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the neurophysiological
   correlates of pain caused by sustained thermal stimulation. A group of
   21 healthy volunteers was studied. Sixty-four channel continuous
   electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded while the subject received
   tonic thermal stimulation. Spectral changes extracted from EEG were
   quantified and correlated with pain scales reported by subjects, the
   stimulation intensity, and the time course. Network connectivity was
   assessed to study the changes in connectivity patterns and strengths
   among brain regions that have been previously implicated in pain
   processing. Spectrally, a global reduction in power was observed in the
   lower spectral range, from delta to alpha, with the most marked changes
   in the alpha band. Spatially, the contralateral region of the
   somatosensory cortex, identified using source localization, was most
   responsive to stimulation status. Maximal desynchrony was observed when
   stimulation was present. The degree of alpha power reduction was
   linearly correlated to the pain rating reported by the subjects.
   Contralateral alpha power changes appeared to be a robust correlate of
   pain intensity experienced by the subjects. Granger causality analysis
   showed changes in network level connectivity among pain-related brain
   regions due to high intensity of pain stimulation versus innocuous warm
   stimulation. These results imply the possibility of using noninvasive
   EEG to predict pain intensity and to study the underlying pain
   processing mechanism in coping with prolonged painful experiences. Once
   validated in a broader population, the present EEG-based approach may
   provide an objective measure for better pain management in clinical
   applications. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a novel approach to obtain energy-efficient
   transmission schedules for delay-limited bursty data under nonideal
   circuit power consumption. Assuming a priori knowledge of packet
   arrivals, deadlines, and channel realizations, we show that the problem
   can be formulated as a convex program. For both time-invariant and
   time-varying fading channels, it is revealed that the optimal
   transmission between any two consecutive channel or data state changing
   instants, termed epoch, can only take one of the three strategies: i) no
   transmission; ii) transmission with an energy-efficiency (EE)-maximizing
   rate over part of the epoch; or iii) transmission with a rate greater
   than the EE-maximizing rate over the whole epoch. Based on this specific
   structure, efficient algorithms are then developed to find the optimal
   policies that minimize the total energy consumption with low complexity.
   The proposed approach can provide the optimal benchmarks for practical
   schemes designed for transmissions of delay-limited data arrivals and
   can be employed to develop efficient online scheduling schemes, which
   require only causal knowledge of data arrivals and deadline
   requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal resource management for smart grid powered multi-input
   multi-output (MIMO) systems is of great importance for future green
   wireless communications. A novel framework is put forth to account for
   the stochastic renewable energy sources (RES), dynamic energy prices, as
   well as random wireless channels. Based on practical models, the
   resource allocation task is formulated as an optimization problem that
   aims at maximizing the weighted sum-rate of the MIMO broadcast channels.
   A two-way transaction mechanism and storage units are introduced to
   accommodate the RES variability. In addition to system operating
   constraints, a budget threshold is imposed on the worst-case energy
   transaction cost due to the possibly adversarial nature. Capitalizing on
   the uplink-downlink duality and the Lagrangian relaxation-based
   subgradient method, an efficient algorithm is developed to obtain the
   optimal strategy. Generalizations to the setups of time-varying channels
   and ON-OFF transmissions are also discussed. Numerical results are
   provided to corroborate the merits of the novel approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Direct experimental access to the monomeric friction coefficient
   (zeta(0) ) relies on the availability of a suitable polymer dynamics
   model. Thus far, no method has been suggested that is applicable to
   filled systems, such as filled rubbers or microphase-segregated A-B-A
   thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) at T-g,T-B < T < T-g, A. Building upon
   the procedure proposed by Ferry for entangled and unfilled polymer
   melts, the Rouse-Bueche theory is applied to an undiluted triblock
   copolymer to extract zeta(0) from the linear behavior in the
   rubber-glass transition region, and to estimate the size of Gaussian
   submolecules. When compared at constant T - T-g, the matrix monomeric
   friction factor is consistent with the corresponding value for the
   homopolymer melt. In addition, the characteristic Rouse dimensions are
   in good agreement with independent estimates based on the Kratky-Porod
   worm-like chain model. These results seem to validate the proposed
   approach for estimating zeta(0) in filled systems. (C) 2016 Wiley

Abstract = {{The feasibility of characterizing asphalt mixtures' rheological and
   failure properties at low temperatures by means of the Bending Beam
   Rheometer (BBR) is investigated in this paper. The main issue is the use
   of thin beams of asphalt mixture in experimental procedures that may not
   capture the true behavior of the material used to construct an asphalt
   pavement.
   For the rheological characterization, three-point bending creep tests
   are performed on beams of different sizes. The beams are also analyzed
   using digital image analysis to obtain volumetric fraction, average size
   distribution, and spatial correlation functions. Based on the
   experimental results and analyses, it is concluded that representative
   creep stiffness values of asphalt mixtures can be obtained from testing
   at least three replicates of the thin (BBR) mixture beams.
   Failure properties are investigated by performing strength tests using a
   modified Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR), capable of applying loads at
   different loading rates. Histogram testing of BBR mixture beams and of
   larger beams is performed and the failure distribution is analyzed based
   on the size effect theory for quasibrittle materials. Different Weibull
   moduli are obtained from the two specimens sizes, which indicates that
   BBR beams do not capture the representative volume element (RVE) of the
   material.}},

Abstract = {{CFTR, the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene, encodes for the CFTR protein that
   plays an essential role in anion regulation and tissue homeostasis of
   various epithelia. In the gastrointestinal (GI) tract CFTR promotes
   chloride and bicarbonate secretion, playing an essential role in ion and
   acid-base homeostasis. Cftr has been identified as a candidate driver
   gene for colorectal cancer (CRC) in several Sleeping Beauty DNA
   transposon-based forward genetic screens in mice. Further, recent
   epidemiological and clinical studies indicate that CF patients are at
   high risk for developing tumors in the colon. To investigate the effects
   of CFTR dysregulation on GI cancer, we generated Apc(Min) mice that
   carried an intestinal-specific knockout of Cftr. Our results indicate
   that Cftr is a tumor suppressor gene in the intestinal tract as Cftr
   mutant mice developed significantly more tumors in the colon and the
   entire small intestine. In Apc(+/+) mice aged to similar to 1 year, Cftr
   deficiency alone caused the development of intestinal tumors in >60\% of
   mice. Colon organoid formation was significantly increased in organoids
   created from Cftr mutant mice compared with wild-type controls,
   suggesting a potential role of Cftr in regulating the intestinal stem
   cell compartment. Microarray data from the Cftr-deficient colon and the
   small intestine identified dysregulated genes that belong to groups of
   immune response, ion channel, intestinal stem cell and other growth
   signaling regulators. These associated clusters of genes were confirmed
   by pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and gene set
   enrichment analysis (GSEA). We also conducted RNA Seq analysis of tumors
   from Apc(+/+) Cftr knockout mice and identified sets of genes
   dysregulated in tumors including altered Wnt beta-catenin target genes.
   Finally we analyzed expression of CFTR in early stage human CRC patients
   stratified by risk of recurrence and found that loss of expression of
   CFTR was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival.}},

Abstract = {{Introducing mesoporosity to conventional microporous sorbents or
   catalysts is often proposed as a solution to enhance their mass
   transport rates. Here, we show that diffusion in these hierarchical
   materials is more complex and exhibits non-monotonic dependence on
   sorbate loading. Our atomistic simulations of n-hexane in a model system
   containing microporous nanosheets and mesopore channels indicate that
   diffusivity can be smaller than in a conventional zeolite with the same
   micropore structure, and this observation holds true even if we confine
   the analysis to molecules completely inside the microporous nanosheets.
   Only at high sorbate loadings or elevated temperatures, when the
   mesopores begin to be sufficiently populated, does the overall diffusion
   in the hierarchical material exceed that in conventional microporous
   zeolites. Our model system is free of structural defects, such as pore
   blocking or surface disorder, that are typically invoked to explain
   slower-than-expected diffusion phenomena in experimental measurements.
   Examination of free energy profiles and visualization of molecular
   diffusion pathways demonstrates that the large free energy cost (mostly
   enthalpic in origin) for escaping from the microporous region into the
   mesopores leads to more tortuous diffusion paths and causes this unusual
   transport behavior in hierarchical nanoporous materials. This knowledge
   allows us to re-examine zero-length-column chromatography data and show
   that these experimental measurements are consistent with the simulation
   data when the crystallite size instead of the nanosheet thickness is
   used for the nominal diffusional length.}},

Abstract = {{Interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) receives enormous consideration
   because of its significance in determining thermal performance of hybrid
   materials, such as polymer based nanocomposites. In this study, the ITC
   between sapphire and polystyrene (PS) was systematically investigated by
   time domain thermoreflectance (TDTR) method. Silane based self-assembled
   monolayers (SAMs) with varying end groups, -NH2, -Cl, -SH and -H, were
   introduced into sapphire/PS interface, and their effects on ITC were
   investigated. The ITC was found to be enhanced up by a factor of 7
   through functionalizing the sapphire surface with SAM, which ends with a
   chloride group (-Cl). The results show that the enhancement of the
   thermal transport across the SAM-functionalized interface comes from
   both strong covalent bonding between sapphire and silane-based SAM, and
   the high compatibility between the SAM and PS. Among the SAMs studied in
   this work, we found that the ITC almost linearly depends on solubility
   parameters, which could be the dominant factor influencing on the ITC
   compared with wettability and adhesion. The SAMs serve as an
   intermediate layer that bridges the sapphire and PS. Such a feature can
   be applied to ceramic-polymer immiscible interfaces by functionalizing
   the ceramic surface with molecules that are miscible with the polymer
   materials. This research provides guidance on the design of
   critical-heat transfer materials such as composites and nanofluids for
   thermal management.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, electrolyte gating techniques employing ionic liquids/gels in
   electric double layer transistors have proven remarkably effective in
   tuning charge carrier density in a variety of materials. The ability to
   control surface carrier densities at levels above 10(14) cm(-2) has led
   to widespread use in the study of superconductivity, insulator-metal
   transitions, etc. In many cases, controversy remains over the doping
   mechanism, however (i.e., electrostatic vs electrochemical (e.g.,
   redox-based)), and the technique has been less applied to magnetic
   materials. Here, we discuss ion gel gating of nanoscale 8-unit-cell
   thick hole-doped La0.5Sr0.5Co3-delta (LSCO) films, probing in detail the
   critical bias windows and doping mechanisms. The LSCO films, which are
   under compressive stress on LaAlO3(001) substrates, are metallic and
   ferromagnetic (Curie temperature, T-c similar to 170 K), with strong
   anomalous Hall effect and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Transport
   measurements reveal that negative gate biases lead to reversible hole
   accumulation (i.e., predominantly electrostatic operation) up to some
   threshold, whereas positive bias immediately induces irreversibility.
   Experiments in inert/O-2 atmospheres directly implicate oxygen vacancies
   in this irreversibility, supported by atomic force microscopy and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy. The results are thus of general importance,
   suggesting that hole- and electron-doped oxides may respond very
   differently to electrolyte gating. Reversible voltage control of
   electronic/magnetic properties is then demonstrated under hole
   accumulation, including resistivity, magnetoresistance, and Tc. The
   sizable anomalous Hall coefficient and perpendicular anisotropy in LSCO
   provide a particularly powerful probe of magnetism, enabling direct
   extraction of the voltage-dependent order parameter and Tc shift. The
   latter amounts to similar to 7\%, with potential for much stronger
   modulation at lower Sr doping.}},

   same substrate but a different enoate reductase (OYE2), we obtained the
   other enantiomer ((-)-beta-methyl-delta-valerolactone) with higher
   selectivity and yield (96\% ee and a 92\% conversion). The enzyme
   docking program LibDock was used to help explain the origin of the

Abstract = {{Pulmonary complications due to infection and idiopathic pneumonia
   syndrome (IPS), a noninfectious lung injury in hematopoietic stem cell
   transplant (HSCT) recipients, are frequent causes of
   transplantation-related mortality and morbidity. Our objective was to
   characterize the global bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) protein
   expression of IPS to identify proteins and pathways that differentiate
   IPS from infectious lung injury after HSCT. We studied 30 BALF samples
   from patients who developed lung injury within 180 days of HSCT or
   cellular therapy transfusion (natural killer cell transfusion). Adult
   subjects were classified as having IPS or infectious lung injury by the
   criteria outlined in the 2011 American Thoracic Society statement. BALF
   was depleted of hemoglobin and 14 high-abundance proteins, treated with
   trypsin, and labeled with isobaric tagging for relative and absolute
   quantification (iTRAQ) 8-plex reagent for two-dimensional capillary
   liquid chromatography (LC) and data dependent peptide tandem mass
   spectrometry (MS) on an Orbitrap Velos system in higher-energy
   collision-induced dissociation activation mode. Protein identification
   employed a target-decoy strategy using ProteinPilot within Galaxy P. The
   relative protein abundance was determined with reference to a global
   internal standard consisting of pooled BALF from patients with
   respiratory failure and no history of HSCT. A variance weighted t-test
   controlling for a false discovery rate of <= 5\% was used to identify
   proteins that showed differential expression between IPS and infectious
   lung injury. The biological relevance of these proteins was determined
   by using gene ontology enrichment analysis and Ingenuity Pathway
   Analysis. We characterized 12 IPS and 18 infectious lung injury BALF
   samples. In the 5 iTRAQ LC-MS/MS experiments 845, 735, 532, 6,15, and
   594 proteins were identified for a total of 1125 unique proteins and 368
   common proteins across all 5 LC-MS/MS experiments. When comparing IPS to
   infectious lung injury, 96 proteins were differentially expressed. Gene
   ontology enrichment analysis showed that these proteins participate in
   biological processes involved in the development of lung injury after
   HSCT. These include acute phase response signaling, complement system,
   coagulation system, liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR),
   and farsenoid X receptor (FXR)/RXR modulation. We identified 2 canonical
   pathways modulated by TNF-alpha, FXR/RXR activation, and IL2 signaling
   in macrophages. The proteins also mapped to blood coagulation,
   fibrinolysis, and wound healing processes that participate in organ
   repair. Cell movement was identified as significantly over-represented
   by proteins with differential expression between IPS and infection. In
   conclusion, the BALF protein expression in IPS differed significantly
   from infectious lung injury in HSCT recipients. These differences
   provide insights into mechanisms that are activated in lung injury in
   HSCT recipients and suggest potential therapeutic targets to augment
   lung repair. (C) 2016 American Society for Blood and Marrow

Abstract = {{Small-scale water tunnel experiments of the phenomenon of
   supercavitation can be carried out broadly using two different kinds of
   experimental models-in the first model (forward facing model, or FFM),
   the incoming flow first interacts with the cavitator at front, which is
   connected to the strut through a ventilation pipe. The second model
   could have the strut and the ventilation pipe preceding the cavitator
   (backward facing model, or BFM). This is the continuation of a water
   tunnel study of the effects of unsteady flows on axisymmetric
   supercavities. In this study, the unwanted effect of test model
   configuration on supercavity shape in periodic flows was explored
   through a comparison of FFM and BFM models. In our experiments, it was
   found that periodic gust flows have only a minimal effect on the maximum
   diameter and the cavity length can be shortened above a certain vertical
   velocity of periodic flows. These findings appear to be robust
   regardless of the model configuration.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of gap plasmons in the third harmonic generation of
   annular and H-shaped aperture arrays has been investigated.
   Surprisingly, the maximum third harmonic in the annular ring structures
   is not from the smallest gap, but rather appears for a gap of 14 nm. We
   interpret this result in terms of resonant plasmonic antenna design to
   match scattering and absorption cross sections. Unlike the annular
   aperture, continuous gold apertures, like the H-structure, achieve
   0.45\% conversion efficiency for 2 mW/mu m(2) CW pump power of a 100 fs
   pulse, which is 9 times larger than rectangular apertures we have
   reported in the past. Nonlinear scattering theory has been used to
   estimate the transmitted third-harmonic signal and is in generally good
   agreement with the experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a 4.4 kW solar receiver/reactor to split carbon
   dioxide via the isothermal cerium dioxide thermochemical redox cycle is
   characterized during steady-state operation in a high-flux solar
   simulator. The solar reactor is the first to implement the isothermal
   redox cycle. Design innovations for continuous fuel production and
   gas-phase heat recuperation distinguish it from prior works. During
   steady-periodic operation at 1750 K, 360 mL min(-1) of CO is produced
   continuously over 45 redox cycles, and up to 95\% of the sensible heat
   of the process gases is, recovered. The solar-to-fuel efficiency is
   1.64\% without consideration of the energy costs of producing nitrogen
   used as a sweep gas during reduction. With inclusion of the solar energy
   required to produce N-2 via cryogenic separation, the efficiency is
   0.72\%. On the basis of the thermodynamic limitations of the cycle and
   the limited opportunity for increasing reactor efficiency beyond 2\%, we
   conclude that the isothermal approach to split CO2 or water via a
   thermochemical metal oxide redox cycle is not attractive for future
   development. Future research should leverage the demonstrated advances
   in reactor design that permit continuous fuel production and recovery of
   the sensible heat of process gases for alternative cycles such as hybrid
   isothermal reforming/redox cycles or two-temperature metal redox cycles
   capable of solid-phase heat recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Water-soluble prodrugs can be rapidly converted by enzymes to
   hydrophobic drugs, whose aqueous thermodynamic solubilities are low, but
   are maintained in aqueous solution at supersaturated concentrations due
   to slow precipitation kinetics. Recently, we investigated avizafone
   (AVF) in combination with Aspergillus oryzae protease as a
   prodrug/enzyme system intended to produce supersaturated diazepam (DZP).
   Several fold enhancement of permeation of supersaturated DZP across
   Madin-Darby canine kidney II-wild type (MDCKII-wt) monolayers was
   observed, compared to saturated DZP solutions. However, prodrug
   conversion was incomplete, putatively due to partial racemization of AVF
   and stereoselectivity of A oryzae protease. Here we report synthesis of
   chirally pure AVF, and demonstrate complete conversion to supersaturated
   DZP followed by complete DZP permeation at enhanced rates across
   MDCKII-wt cell monolayers. We also synthesized, for the first time, a
   chirally pure prodrug of midazolam (MDZ-pro) and carried out the same
   sequence of studies. A oryzae protease was identified as a benign and
   efficient activating enzyme for MDZ-pro. The MDZ-pro/A oryzae protease
   system showed greater than 25-fold increase in absorption rate of MDZ
   across MDCKII-wt monolayers, compared to saturated MDZ. Such chirally
   pure prodrug/enzyme systems are promising candidates for efficient
   intranasal delivery of benzodiazepine drugs used in the treatment of
   seizure emergencies. (C) 2016 American Pharmacists Association (R).

Abstract = {{Structural transformations in crystalline solids are increasingly the
   basis of the functional behavior of materials. Recently, in diverse
   alloy systems, both low hysteresis and reversibility of phase
   transformations have been linked to the satisfaction of the non generic
   conditions of compatibility between phases. According to the Cauchy-Born
   rule, these conditions are expressed as properties of transformation
   stretch tensor. The transformation stretch tensor is difficult to
   measure directly due to the lack of knowledge about the exact
   transforming pathway during the structural change, and the complicating
   effects of microstructure. In this paper we give a rigorous algorithmic
   approach for determining the transformation stretch tensor from X-ray
   measurements of structure and lattice parameters. For some traditional
   and emerging phase transformations, the results given by the algorithm
   suggest unexpected transformation mechanisms. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The non-uniqueness of the atomistic stress tensor is a well-known issue
   when defining continuum fields for atomistic systems. In this paper, we
   study the non-uniqueness of the atomistic stress tensor stemming from
   the non-uniqueness of the potential energy representation. In
   particular, we show using rigidity theory that the distribution
   associated with the potential part of the atomistic stress tensor can be
   decomposed into an irrotational part that is independent of the
   potential energy representation, and a traction-free solenoidal part.
   Therefore, we have identified for the atomistic stress tensor a discrete
   analog of the continuum generalized Beltrami representation (a version
   of the vector Helmholtz decomposition for symmetric tensors). We
   demonstrate the validity of these analogies using a numerical test. A
   program for performing the decomposition of the atomistic stress tensor
   called MDStresslab is available online at http://mdstresslab.org. (C)

Abstract = {{Cultured mammalian cells are the main workhorses for producing
   biologics. The performance of these cell culture processes, in terms of
   both productivity and product quality attributes, is significantly
   influenced by cellular metabolism. Glucose is the major carbon source
   for cellular biosynthesis and energy generation. We summarize here
   recent advances in our understanding of the regulation of glucose
   metabolism in cultured cells. The versatility of cells to sustain
   homeostatic states under widely varying environments is made possible by
   allosteric regulation of the metabolic network, interplay between the
   signaling pathways, and transcription factors. Understanding the
   regulation of metabolism holds the key to altering the metabolic
   regulatory circuit and implementing direct metabolic control over cell
   culture processes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this review was to evaluate the potential of
   tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA) for neuroprotection in traumatic brain
   injury (TBI) patients in the neurocritical care setting. Specifically,
   we surveyed preclinical studies describing the neuroprotective and
   systemic effects of TUDCA, and the potential therapeutic application of
   TUDCA. Preclinical studies have provided promising data supporting its
   use in neurological disease characterized by apoptosis-induced neuronal
   loss. TUDCA inhibits multiple proteins involved in apoptosis and
   upregulates cell survival pathways. In addition, TUDCA exhibits
   anti-inflammatory effects in models of neuroinflammation and attenuates
   neuronal loss in chronic neurodegenerative diseases. This may be
   applicable to TBI, which also triggers inflammatory and apoptotic
   processes. Additionally, preliminary data support the use of
   pharmacological therapies that reduce apoptosis and inflammation
   associated with TBI. The anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms
   of TUDCA could prove promising in the treatment of TBI. Currently, there
   are no published data supporting improvement in clinical outcomes of TBI

Abstract = {{Wireless sensor networks have been used in many mobile applications such
   as wildlife tracking and participatory urban sensing. Because of the
   combination of high mobility and low-duty-cycle operations, it is a
   challenging issue to reduce discovery delay among mobile nodes, so that
   mobile nodes can establish connection quickly once they are within each
   other's vicinity. Existing discovery designs are essentially pairwise
   based, in which discovery is passively achieved when two nodes are
   prescheduled to wake up at the same time. In contrast, this work reduces
   discovery delay significantly by proactively referring wake-up schedules
   among a group of nodes. Since proactive references incur additional
   overhead, we introduce a novel selective reference mechanism based on
   spatiotemporal properties of neighborhood and the mobility of nodes. Our
   quantitative analysis indicates that the discovery delay of our
   group-based mechanism is significantly smaller than that of the pairwise
   one. Our testbed experiments using 40 sensor nodes and extensive
   simulations confirm the theoretical analysis, showing one order of
   magnitude reduction in discovery delay compared with legacy pairwise
   methods in dense, uniformly distributed sensor networks with at most 8.8
   percent increase in energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Data collected at the Eolos wind research facility and in the Saint
   Anthony Falls Laboratory atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel are used
   to study the impact of turbulent inflow conditions on the performance of
   a horizontal axis wind turbine on flat terrain. The Eolos test facility
   comprises a 2.5MW Clipper Liberty C96 wind turbine, a meteorological
   tower and a WindCube LiDAR wind profiler. A second set of experiments
   was completed using particle image velocimetry upwind and in a wake of a
   miniature turbine in the wind tunnel to complement LiDAR measurements
   near the Eolos turbine. Joint statistics, most notably temporal
   cross-correlations between wind velocity at different heights and
   turbine performance, are presented and compared at both the laboratory
   and field scales. The work (i) confirms that the turbine exerts a
   blockage effect on the mean flow and (ii) suggests a key, specific
   elevation, above hub height, where the incoming velocity signal is
   statistically most relevant to turbine operation and control. Wind
   tunnel measurements confirm such indication and suggest that hub height
   velocity measurements are optimal for wind preview and/or as input for
   active control strategies in aligned turbine configurations. Copyright

Abstract = {{Individual wind turbines in a wind farm typically operate to maximize
   their performance with no consideration of the impact of wake effects on
   downstream turbines. There is potential to increase power and reduce
   structural loads within a wind farm by properly coordinating the
   turbines. To effectively design and analyze coordinated wind turbine
   controllers requires control-oriented turbine wake models of sufficient
   accuracy. This paper focuses on constructing such a model from
   experiments. The experiments were conducted to better understand the
   wake interaction and impact on voltage production in a three-turbine
   array. The upstream turbine operating condition was modulated in time,
   and the dynamic impact on the downstream turbine was recorded through
   the voltage output time signal. The flow dynamics observed in the
   experiments were used to improve a static wake model often used in the
   literature for wind farm control. These experiments were performed in
   the atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel at the Saint Anthony Falls
   Laboratory at the University of Minnesota using particle image
   velocimetry for flow field analysis and turbine voltage modulation to
   capture the physical evolution in addition to the dynamics of turbine
   wake interactions. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Title = {{Antagonistic Donor Density Effect Conserved in Multiple Enterococcal
   Conjugative Plasmids}},
Journal = {{APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL MICROBIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{Enterococcus faecalis, a common causative agent of hospital-acquired
   infections, is resistant to many known antibiotics. Its ability to
   acquire and transfer resistance genes and virulence determinants through
   conjugative plasmids poses a serious concern for public health. In some
   cases, induction of transfer of E. faecalis plasmids results from
   peptide pheromones produced by plasmid-free recipient cells, which are
   sensed by the plasmid-bearing donor cells. These plasmids generally
   encode an inhibitory peptide that competes with the pheromone and
   suppresses self-induction of donors. We recently demonstrated that the
   inhibitor peptide encoded on plasmid pCF10 is part of a unique
   quorum-sensing system in which it functions as a ``self-sensing
   signal,{''} reducing the response to the pheromone in a
   density-dependent fashion. Based on the similarities between regulatory
   features controlling conjugation in pAD1 and pAM373 and those
   controlling conjugation in pCF10, we hypothesized that these plasmids
   are likely to exhibit similar quorum-sensing behaviors. Experimental
   findings indicate that for both pAD1 and pAM373, high donor densities
   indeed resulted in decreased induction of the conjugation operon and
   reduced conjugation frequencies. This effect was restored by the
   addition of exogenous inhibitor, confirming that the inhibitor serves as
   an indicator for donor density. Donor density also affects cross-species
   conjugative plasmid transfer. Based on our experimental results, we
   propose models for induction and shutdown of the conjugation operon in
   pAD1 and pAM373.
   IMPORTANCE
   Enterococcus faecalis is a leading cause of hospital-acquired
   infections. Its ability to transfer antibiotic resistance and virulence
   determinants by sharing its genetic material with other bacteria through
   direct cell-cell contact via conjugation poses a serious threat. Two
   antagonistic signaling peptides control the transfer of plasmids pAD1
   and pAM373: a peptide pheromone produced by plasmid-free recipients
   triggers the conjugative transfer in plasmid-containing donors, and an
   inhibitor peptide encoded on the plasmid and produced by donor cells
   serves to modulate the donor response in accordance with the relative
   abundance of donors and recipients. We demonstrate that high donor
   density reduces the conjugation frequency of both of these plasmids,
   which is a consequence of increased inhibitor concentration in
   high-donor-density cultures. While most antibiotic strategies end up
   selecting resistant strains and disrupting the community balance,
   manipulating bacterial signaling mechanisms can serve as an alternate
   strategy to prevent the spread of antibiotic resistance.}},

Abstract = {{On par with data-intensive applications, the sheer size of modern linear
   regression problems creates an ever-growing demand for efficient
   solvers. Fortunately, a significant percentage of the data accrued can
   be omitted while maintaining a certain quality of statistical inference
   with an affordable computational budget. This work introduces means of
   identifying and omitting less informative observations in an online and
   data-adaptive fashion. Given streaming data, the related
   maximum-likelihood estimator is sequentially found using first-and
   second-order stochastic approximation algorithms. These schemes are well
   suited when data are inherently censored or when the aim is to save
   communication overhead in decentralized learning setups. In a different
   operational scenario, the task of joint censoring and estimation is put
   forth to solve large-scale linear regressions in a centralized setup.
   Novel online algorithms are developed enjoying simple closed-form
   updates and provable (non) asymptotic convergence guarantees. To attain
   desired censoring patterns and levels of dimensionality reduction,
   thresholding rules are investigated too. Numerical tests on real and
   synthetic datasets corroborate the efficacy of the proposed
   data-adaptive methods compared to data-agnostic random projection-based
   alternatives.}},

Title = {{Inosculation and perfusion of pre-vascularized tissue patches containing
   aligned human microvessels after myocardial infarction}},
Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{51-61}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{A major goal of tissue engineering is the creation of pre-vascularized
   tissues that have a high density of organized microvessels that can be
   rapidly perfused following implantation. This is especially critical for
   highly metabolic tissues like myocardium, where a thick myocardial
   engineered tissue would require rapid perfusion within the first several
   days to survive transplantation. In the present work, tissue patches
   containing human microvessels that were either randomly oriented or
   aligned were placed acutely on rat hearts post-infarction and for each
   case it was determined whether rapid inosculation could occur and
   perfusion of the patch could be maintained for 6 days in an infarct
   environment. Patches containing self-assembled microvessels were formed
   by co-entrapment of human blood outgrowth endothelial cells and human
   pericytes in fibrin gel. Cell-induced gel contraction was mechanically
   constrained resulting in samples with high densities of microvessels
   that were either randomly oriented (with 420 +/- 140 lumens/mm(2)) or
   uniaxially aligned (with 940 +/- 240 lumens/mm(2)) at the time of
   implantation. These patches were sutured onto the epicardial surface of
   the hearts of athymic rats following permanent ligation of the left
   anterior descending artery. In both aligned and randomly oriented
   microvessel patches, inosculation occurred and perfusion of the
   transplanted human microvessels was maintained, proving the in vivo
   vascularization potential of these engineered tissues. No difference was
   found in the number of human microvessels that were perfused in the
   randomly oriented (111 +/- 75 perfused lumens/mm(2)) and aligned (173
   +/- 97 perfused lumens/mm(2)) patches. Our results demonstrate that
   tissue patches containing a high density of either aligned or randomly
   oriented human pre-formed microvessels achieve rapid perfusion in the
   myocardial infarct environment - a necessary first-step toward the
   creation of a thick, perfusable heart patch. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Promotional effects of chemisorbed oxygen and hydroxide in the
   activation of C-H and O-H bonds over transition metal surfaces}},
Journal = {{SURFACE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{650}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{210-220}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Electronegative coadsorbates such as atomic oxygen (O{*}) and hydroxide
   (OH{*}) can act as Bronsted bases when bound to Group 11 as well as
   particular Group 8-10 metal surfaces and aid in the activation of X-H
   bonds. First principle density functional theory calculations were
   carried out to systematically explore the reactivity of the C-H bonds of
   methane and surface methyl intermediates as well as the O-H bond of
   methanol directly and with the assistance of coadsorbed O{*} and OH{*}
   intermediates over Group 11 (Cu, Ag, and Au) and Group 8-10 transition
   metal (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt) surfaces. C-H as well as O-H bond
   activation over the metal proceeds via a classic oxidative addition type
   mechanism involving the insertion of the metal center into the C-H or
   O-H bond. O{*} and OH{*} assist C-H and O-H activation over particular
   Group 11 and Group 8-10 metal surfaces via a 6-bond metathesis type
   mechanism involving the oxidative addition of the C-H or O-H bond to the
   metal along with a reductive deprotonation of the acidic C-H and O-H
   bond over the M-O{*} or M-OH{*} site pair. The O{*}- and OH{*}-assisted
   C-H activation paths are energetically preferred over the direct metal
   catalyzed C-H scission for all Group 11 metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) with
   barriers that are 0.4-1.5 eV lower than those for the unassisted routes.
   The barriers for O{*}- and OH{*}-assisted C-H activation of CH4 on the
   Group 8-10 transition metals, however, are higher than those over the
   bare transition metal surfaces by as much as 1.4 eV. The C-H activation
   of adsorbed methyl species show very similar trends to those for CH4
   despite the differences in structure between the weakly bound methane
   and the covalently adsorbed methyl intermediates. The activation of the
   O-H bond of methanol is significantly promoted by O{*} as well as OH{*}
   intermediates over both the Group 11 metals (Cu, Ag, and Au) as well as
   on all Group 8-10 metals studied (Ru, Rh, Pd, Os, Ir, and Pt). The O{*}-
   and OH{*}-assisted CH3O-H barriers are 0.6 to 2.0 eV lower than
   unassisted barriers, with the largest differences occurring on Group 11
   metals. The higher degree of O{*}- and OH{*}-promotion in activating
   methanol over that in methane and methyl is due to the stronger
   interaction between the basic O{*} and OH{*} sites and the acidic proton
   in the O-H bond of methanol versus the non-acidic H in the C-H bond of
   methane. A detailed analysis of the binding energies and the charges for
   O{*} and OH{*} on different metal surfaces indicates that the marked
   differences in the properties and reactivity of O{*} and OH{*} between
   the Group 11 and Group 8-10 metals is due to the increased negative
   charge on the O-atoms (in O{*} as well as OH{*}) bound to Group 11
   metals. The promotional effects of O{*} and OH{*} are consistent with a
   proton-coupled electron transfer and the cooperative role of the
   metal-O{*} or metal-OH{*} pair in carrying out the oxidative addition
   and reductive deprotonation of the acidic C-H and O-H bonds. Ultimately,
   the ability of O{*} or OH{*} to act as a Brensted base depends upon its
   charge, its binding energy on the metal surface (due to shifts in its
   position during X-H activation), and the acidity of the H-atom being
   abstracted. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The production of lipids and astaxanthin, a high-value carotenoid, by
   Chlorella zofingiensis was investigated under different culture
   conditions. Comparative analysis revealed a good correlation between
   triacylglycerol (TAG) and astaxanthin accumulation in C. zofingiensis.
   Stress conditions promoted cell size and weight and induced the
   accumulation of neutral lipids, especially TAG and astaxanthin, with a
   concomitant decrease in membrane lipids. The highest contents of TAG and
   astaxanthin achieved were 387 and 4.89 mg g(-1) dry weight,
   respectively. A semi-continuous culture strategy was developed to
   optimize the TAG and astaxanthin productivities, which reached 297 and
   3.3 mg L-1 day(-1), respectively. Additionally, astaxanthin accumulation
   was enhanced by inhibiting de novo fatty acid biosynthesis. In summary,
   our study represents a pioneering work of utilizing Chlorella for the
   integrated production of lipids and high-value products and C.
   zofingiensis has great potential to be a promising production strain and
   serve as an emerging oleaginous model alga. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {{826-835}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Scum is an oil-rich waste from the wastewater treatment plants with a
   high-sulfur level. In this work, a novel process was developed to
   convert scum to high quality and low sulfur content biodiesel. A
   combination of solvent extraction and acid washing as pretreatment was
   developed to lower the sulfur content in the scum feedstock and hence
   improve biodiesel conversion yield and quality. Glycerin esterification
   was then employed to convert free fatty acids to glycerides. Moreover, a
   new distillation process integrating the traditional reflux distillation
   and adsorptive desulfurization was developed to further remove sulfur
   from the crude biodiesel. As a result, 70\% of the filtered and dried
   scum was converted to biodiesel with sulfur content lower than 15 ppm.
   The fatty acid methyl ester profiles showed that the refined biodiesel
   from the new process exhibited a higher quality and better properties
   than that from traditional process reported in previous studies. (C)

Title = {{Electrochemical sulfide removal by low-cost electrode materials in
   anaerobic digestion}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},

Volume = {{297}},

Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Hydrogen sulfide removal is usually a necessary but costly step
   following the anaerobic digestion (AD) in order to upgrade biogas
   quality. Mitigating sulfide levels of biogas and digestate
   simultaneously in AD process will decrease the capital cost by
   eliminating standalone biogas upgrading facility. However, current in
   situ remediation methods, for instance, dosing of magnesium/sodium
   hydroxide, oxygen gas, iron salts, and nitrite or nitrate, potentially
   cause interference to biogas production and may intensively consume
   energy and chemicals. Here, an electrochemical remediation method was
   studied to use low price electrode materials of carbon cloth and
   stainless steel AISI 304. These electrode materials at 3 V showed a
   complete removal of sulfide in 2 days in synthetic media of 10 mM
   sulfide solution. Operating conditions for carbon cloth and stainless
   steel electrodes as well as major intermediates of electrochemical
   reactions in bench-scale digester fed with dairy manure were examined to
   study the performances in sulfide removal and biomethane production.
   Based on the results, it was concluded that carbon cloth at 2 and 3 V,
   and stainless steel anodes at both 1 and 2 V have a potential of
   significantly removing hydrogen sulfide from biogas under continuous
   operation given sufficient electrode surface area. Intermittent 3 V
   voltage application (15 minutes per day) of stainless steel can remove
   most biogas hydrogen sulfide. The electrochemical sulfide oxidation and
   removal showed no/little negative effect on biomethane production, and
   therefore can be a promising technology for the AD industry to develop a
   cost-effective approach to producing sulfide free biogas. (C) 2016

Title = {{Removal of airborne sub-3 nm particles using fibrous filters and
   granular activated carbons}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The filtration efficiencies of fibrous filters and a granular activated
   carbon (GAC) for sub-3 nm particles were investigated, which were not
   previously well-studied. The sub-3 nm particles were classified by a
   high resolution differential mobility analyzer and measured by an
   aerosol electrometer. The penetration of sub-3 nm particles through the
   GAC was well-matched with the previous results using 3-30 nm particles.
   All tested fibrous filters showed 100\% filtration efficiency for the
   sub-3 nm particles and were still sufficiently powerful to eliminate
   nanoparticles in the air down to 1.5 rim. Although the GAC showed lower
   filtration efficiency than the fibrous filters, GACs can be used to
   reduce the concentration of both gas molecules and nanoparticles
   simultaneously with a low pressure drop. The single sphere efficiency of
   the GAC for the sub-3 nm particles was a power-law of the Peclet number,
   and the exponent was 0.35. The exponent was higher than that for 3-30 nm
   particles, 0.5. Moreover, the exponent for 1.5-30 nm particles was 0.43,
   which was the same as that of the single fiber efficiency observed by
   others. This requires a new particle filtration model of porous filter
   media such as GACs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Expediting analog design retargeting by design knowledge re-use and

Abstract = {{In the past decade or two, due to constant and rapid technology changes,
   analog design re-use or design retargeting to newer technologies has
   been brought to the table in order to expedite the design process and
   improve time-to-market. If properly conducted, analog design retargeting
   could significantly cut down design cycle compared to designs starting
   from the scratch. In this article, we present an empirical and general
   method for efficient analog design retargeting by design knowledge
   re-use and circuit synthesis (CS). The method first identifies circuit
   blocks that compose the source system and extracts the performance
   parameter specifications of each circuit block. Then, for each circuit
   block, it scales the values of design variables (DV) from the source
   design to derive an initial design in the target technology. Depending
   on the performance of this initial target design, a design space is
   defined for synthesis. Subsequently, each circuit block is automatically
   synthesised using state-of-art analog synthesis tools based on a
   combination of global and local optimisation techniques to achieve
   comparable performance specifications to those extracted from the source
   system. Finally, the overall system is composed of those synthesised
   circuit blocks in the target technology. We illustrate the method using
   a practical example of a complex Delta-Sigma modulator (DSM) circuit.}},

Title = {{Adaptive one-bit quantization for compressed sensing}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{125}},
Pages = {{145-155}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{There have been a number of studies on sparse signal recovery from
   one-bit quantized measurements. Nevertheless, less attention has been
   paid to the choice of the quantization thresholds and its impact on the
   signal recovery performance. In this paper, we examine the problem of
   quantization in a general framework of one-bit compressed sensing with
   non-zero quantization thresholds. Our analysis shows that when the
   number of one-bit measurements is sufficiently large, with a high
   probability the sparse signal can be recovered with an error decaying
   linearly with the l(2)-norm of the difference between the quantization
   thresholds and the original unquantized measurements. Specifically, by
   setting the thresholds sufficiently close to the original unquantized
   measurements, sparse signals can be recovered with an arbitrarily small
   error. By borrowing an idea from the Delta modulation, we propose an
   adaptive quantization scheme where the quantization thresholds are
   iteratively adjusted based on previous encoded bits such that they
   eventually oscillate around the original unquantized measurements with
   decreasing granular noise. Numerical results are provided to collaborate
   our theoretical results and to illustrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed scheme. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Synthesizing Virtual Oscillators to Control Islanded Inverters}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{6002-6015}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Virtual oscillator control (VOC) is a decentralized control strategy for
   islanded microgrids where inverters are regulated to emulate the
   dynamics of weakly nonlinear oscillators. Compared to droop control,
   which is only well defined in sinusoidal steady state, VOC is a
   time-domain controller that enables interconnected inverters to
   stabilize arbitrary initial conditions to a synchronized sinusoidal
   limit cycle. However, the nonlinear oscillators that are elemental to
   VOC cannot be designed with conventional linear-control design methods.
   We address this challenge by applying averaging-and perturbation-based
   nonlinear analysis methods to extract the sinusoidal steady-state and
   harmonic behavior of such oscillators. The averaged models reveal
   conclusive links between real-and reactive-power outputs and the
   terminal-voltage dynamics. Similarly, the perturbation methods aid in
   quantifying higher order harmonics. The resultant models are then
   leveraged to formulate a design procedure for VOC such that the inverter
   satisfies standard ac performance specifications related to voltage
   regulation, frequency regulation, dynamic response, and harmonic
   content. Experimental results for a single-phase 750 VA, 120 V
   laboratory prototype demonstrate the validity of the design approach.
   They also demonstrate that droop laws are, in fact, embedded within the
   equilibria of the nonlinear-oscillator dynamics. This establishes the
   backward compatibility of VOC in that, while acting on time-domain
   waveforms, it subsumes droop control in sinusoidal steady state.}},

Title = {{Multiscale Cues Drive Collective Cell Migration}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 27}},
Abstract = {{To investigate complex biophysical relationships driving directed cell
   migration, we developed a biomimetic platform that allows perturbation
   of microscale geometric constraints with concomitant nanoscale contact
   guidance architectures. This permits us to elucidate the influence, and
   parse out the relative contribution, of multiscale features, and define
   how these physical inputs are jointly processed with oncogenic
   signaling. We demonstrate that collective cell migration is profoundly
   enhanced by the addition of contract guidance cues when not otherwise
   constrained. However, while nanoscale cues promoted migration in all
   cases, microscale directed migration cues are dominant as the geometric
   constraint narrows, a behavior that is well explained by stochastic
   diffusion anisotropy modeling. Further, oncogene activation (i.e. mutant
   PIK3CA) resulted in profoundly increased migration where extracellular
   multiscale directed migration cues and intrinsic signaling
   synergistically conspire to greatly outperform normal cells or any
   extracellular guidance cues in isolation.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrated the use of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) to
   evaluate the composition of phenytoin:hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
   acetate succinate (HPMCAS) spin-coated solid dispersions (SDs). To
   overcome the inability of bright-field and high-angle annular dark-field
   TEM imaging to distinguish between glassy drug and polymer, we used the
   pi-pi{*} transition peak in the EELS spectrum to detect phenytoin within
   the HPMCAS matrix of the SD. The concentration of phenytoin within SDs
   of 10, 25, and 50 wt \% drug loading was quantified by a multiple
   least-squares analysis. Evaluating the concentration of 50 different
   regions in each SD, we determined that phenytoin and HPMCAS are
   intimately mixed at a length scale of 200 nm, even for drug loadings up
   to 50 wt \%. At length scales below 100 nm, the variance of the measured
   phenytoin concentration increases; we speculate that this increase is
   due to statistical fluctuations in local concentration and chemical
   changes induced by electron irradiation. We also performed EELS analysis
   of an annealed 25 wt \% phenytoin SD and showed that the technique can
   resolve concentration differences between regions that are less than 50
   nm apart. Our findings indicate that EELS is a useful tool for
   quantifying, with high accuracy and sub-100 nm spatial resolution, the
   composition of many pharmaceutical and soft matter systems.}},

   modes of continuum materials have Chern numbers, analogous to those of
   photonic crystals. This can lead to the appearance of
   topologically-protected surface modes at material interfaces,
   propagating at frequencies inside the bandgap of the bulk materials.
   Previous studies considered two-dimensional structures; here we consider
   the effect of three-dimensional defects, and show that, although
   backward propagation/reflection cannot occur, side scattering does take
   place and has significant effect on the propagation of the surface mode.
   Several different waveguiding geometries are considered for reducing the
   effects of side-scattering, and we also consider the effects of metal
   loss.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Comparison of Photothermal Heat Generation between Gold
   Nanospheres and Nanorods}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Gold nanoparticles (GNPs) are widely used for biomedical applications
   due to unique optical properties, established synthesis methods, and
   biological compatibility. Despite important applications of plasmonic
   heating in thermal therapy, imaging, and diagnostics, the lack of
   quantification in heat generation leads to difficulties in comparing the
   heating capability for new plasmonic nanostructures and predicting the
   therapeutic and diagnostic outcome. This study quantifies GNP heat
   generation by experimental measurements and theoretical predictions for
   gold nanospheres (GNS) and nanorods (GNR). Interestingly, the results
   show a GNP-type dependent agreement between experiment and theory. The
   measured heat generation of GNS matches well with theory, while the
   measured heat generation of GNR is only 30\% of that predicted
   theoretically at peak absorption. This then leads to a surprising
   finding that the polydispersity, the deviation of nanoparticle size and
   shape from nominal value, significantly influences GNR heat generation
   (> 70\% reduction), while having a limited effect for GNS (< 10\%
   change). This work demonstrates that polydispersity is an important
   metric in quantitatively predicting plasmonic heat generation and
   provides a validated framework to quantitatively compare the heating
   capabilities between gold and other plasmonic nanostructures.}},

Title = {{Geminivirus-Mediated Genome Editing in Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.)
   Using Sequence-Specific Nucleases}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL 21}},
Abstract = {{Genome editing using sequence-specific nucleases (SSNs) is rapidly being
   developed for genetic engineering in crop species. The utilization of
   zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector
   nucleases (TALENs), and clustered regularly interspaced short
   palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated systems (CRISPR/Cas) for inducing
   double-strand breaks facilitates targeting of virtually any sequence for
   modification. Targeted mutagenesis via non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
   has been demonstrated extensively as being the preferred DNA repair
   pathway in plants. However, gene targeting via homologous recombination
   (HR) remains more elusive but could be a powerful tool for directed DNA
   repair. To overcome barriers associated with gene targeting, a
   geminivirus replicon (GVR) was used to deliver SSNs targeting the potato
   ACETOLACTATE SYNTHASE1 (ALS1) gene and repair templates designed to
   incorporate herbicide-inhibiting point mutations within the ALS1 locus.
   Transformed events modified with GVRs held point mutations that were
   capable of supporting a reduced herbicide susceptibility phenotype,
   while events transformed with conventional T-DNAs held no detectable
   mutations and were similar to wild-type. Regeneration of transformed
   events improved detection of point mutations that supported a stronger
   reduced herbicide susceptibility phenotype. These results demonstrate
   the use of geminiviruses for delivering genome editing reagents in plant
   species, and a novel approach to gene targeting in a vegetatively
   propagated species.}},

Abstract = {{A subsampling technique for real-time phase retrieval of high-speed
   thermal signals is demonstrated with heated metal lines such as those
   found in microelectronic interconnects. The thermal signals were
   produced by applying a current through aluminum resistors deposited on
   soda-lime-silica glass, and the resulting refractive index changes were
   measured using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer with a microscope objective
   and high-speed camera. The temperatures of the resistors were measured
   both by the phase-retrieval method and by monitoring the resistance of
   the aluminum lines. The method used to analyze the phase is at least 60x
   faster than the state of the art but it maintains a small spatial phase
   noise of 16 nm, remaining comparable to the state of the art. For slowly
   varying signals, the system is able to perform absolute phase
   measurements over time, distinguishing temperature changes as small as 2
   K. With angular scanning or structured illumination improvements, the
   system could also perform fast thermal tomography. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{This paper addresses implementation of digital IIR filters using
   stochastic computing. Stochastic computing requires fewer logic gates
   and is inherently fault-tolerant. Thus, these structures are well suited
   for nanoscale CMOS technologies. While it is easy to realize FIR filters
   using stochastic computing, implementation of IIR digital filters is
   non-trivial. Stochastic logic assumes independence of input signals;
   however, feedback in IIR digital filters leads to correlation of input
   signals, and the independence assumption is violated. This paper
   demonstrates that, despite feedback in IIR filters, these filters can be
   implemented using stochastic logic. The key to stochastic implementation
   is selection of an IIR filter structure where the states are orthogonal
   and are, therefore, uncorrelated. Two categories of architectures are
   presented for stochastic IIR digital filters. One category is based on
   the basic lattice filter representation where the states are orthogonal,
   and the other is based on the normalized lattice filter representation
   where states are orthonormal. For each category, three stochastic
   implementations are introduced. The first is based on a state-space
   description of the IIR filter derived from the lattice filter structure.
   The second is based on transforming the lattice IIR digital filter into
   an equivalent form that can exploit the novel scaling approach developed
   for inner product computations. The third is optimized stochastic
   implementation with reduced number of binary multipliers. Simulation
   results demonstrate high signal-to-error ratio and fault tolerance in
   these structures. Furthermore, hardware synthesis results show that
   these filter structures require lower hardware area and power compared
   to two's complement realizations.}},

Abstract = {{This work details the phase behavior of a pseudotemary polymer blend
   system containing poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and polystyrene (PS)
   homopolyrners, a PS-PEO block copolymer, and lithium

   system is described along the volumetrically symmetric isopleth at a
   fixed LiTFSI concentration relative to the PEO component. The addition
   of LiTFSI dramatically increases the segregation strength of the blend,
   causing the otherwise globally disordered blends to exhibit a variety of
   microstructured morphologies typically found in salt-free ternary
   polymer blends, such as lamellae, a hexagonal phase, and a bicontinuous
   microemulsion. The breadth of morphologies and segregation strengths
   that can be accessed in this system by simply tuning blend composition
   establishes a new framework for the design of future ternary blend
   systems and, more broadly, polymeric materials where microstructured,
   well segregated domains with tunable ion transport properties are

   where the constituent monolayers have band edges at the zone center,
   i.e., Gamma valley. Our study, which includes the group IV and III-V
   compound monolayer materials, group V elemental monolayer materials,
   transition-metal dichalcogenides, and transition-metal trichalcogenides,
   reveals that almost half of these materials have conduction and/or
   valence band edges residing at the zone center. Using first-principles
   density functional calculations, we present the type of the
   heterostructure for 903 different possible combinations of these 2D
   materials which establishes a periodic table of heterostructures.}},

Title = {{Optimization of multi-grating volume holographic spectrum splitters for
   photovoltaic applications}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has shown that using multiple diverse-bandgap
   photovoltaic (PV) cells in conjunction with a spectrum splitting optical
   system can significantly improve PV power generation efficiency.
   Although volume Bragg gratings (VBGs) can serve as effective spectrum
   splitters, the inherent dispersion of a VBG can be detrimental given a
   broad-spectrum input. The performance of a single holographic spectrum
   splitter element can be improved by utilizing multiple single volume
   gratings, each operating in a slightly different spectral band. However,
   care must be taken to avoid inter-grating coupling effects that limit
   the ultimate performance. This work explores broadband two-grating
   holographic optical elements (HOEs) in multiplexed (single element) and
   sandwiched-grating arrangements. Particle swarm optimization is used to
   tailor these systems to the solar spectrum, taking into account both
   efficiency and dispersion. Both multiplexed and sandwiched two-grating
   systems exhibit performance improvements over single-grating solutions,
   especially when reduced dispersion is required. Under a +/- 2 degrees
   constraint on output angular spread from wavelength dispersion,
   sandwiched-, multiplexed-, and single-grating systems exhibit power
   conversion efficiencies of 82.1\%, 80.9\%, and 77.5\%, respectively,
   compared to an ideal bandpass spectrum splitter. Dispersion performance
   can be further improved by employing more than two VBGs in the spectrum
   splitter, but efficiency is compromised by additional cross-coupling
   effects. Multiplexed-grating systems are especially susceptible to these
   effects, but have the advantage of utilizing only a single HOE. (C) 2016

Title = {{Rapid and efficient galactose fermentation by engineered Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{229}},
Pages = {{13-21}},
Month = {{JUL 10}},
Abstract = {{the important industrial yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, galactose
   metabolism requires energy production by respiration; therefore, this
   yeast cannot metabolize galactose under strict anaerobic conditions.
   While the respiratory dependence of galactose metabolism provides
   benefits in terms of cell growth and population stability, it is not
   advantageous for producing fuels and chemicals since a substantial
   fraction of consumed galactose is converted to carbon dioxide. In order
   to force S. cerevisiae to use galactose without respiration, a subunit
   (COX9) of a respiratory enzyme was deleted, but the resulting deletion
   mutant (Delta cox9) was impaired in terms of galactose assimilation.
   Interestingly, after serial sub-cultures on galactose, the mutant
   evolved rapidly and was able to use galactose via fermentation only. The
   evolved strain (JQ-G1) produced ethanol from galactose with a 94\%
   increase in yield and 6.9-fold improvement in specific productivity as
   compared to the wild-type strain. C-13-metabolic flux analysis
   demonstrated a three-fold reduction in carbon flux through the TCA cycle
   of the evolved mutant with redirection of flux toward the fermentation
   pathway. Genome sequencing of the JQ-G1 strain revealed a loss of
   function mutation in a master negative regulator of the Leloir pathway
   (Gal80p). The mutation ( Glu348{*}) in Ga180p was found to act
   synergistically with deletion of COX9 for efficient galactose
   fermentation, and thus the double deletion mutant Delta cox9 Delta gal80
   produced ethanol 2.4 times faster and with 35\% higher yield than a
   single knockout mutant with deletion of GAL80 alone. When we introduced
   a functional COX9 cassette back into the JQ-G1 strain, the JQ-G1-COX9
   strain showed a 33\% reduction in specific galactose uptake rate and a
   49\% reduction in specific ethanol production rate as compared to JQ-G1.
   The wild-type strain was also subjected to serial sub-cultures on
   galactose but we failed to isolate a mutant capable of utilizing
   galactose without respiration. We concluded that the metabolic ``death
   valley{''} (i.e. no galactose utilization by the Delta cox9 mutant) is a
   necessary intermediate phenotype to facilitate galactose utilization
   without respiration in yeast. The results in this study demonstrate a
   promising approach for directing adaptive evolution toward fermentative
   metabolism and for generating evolved yeast strains with improved
   phenotypes under anaerobic conditions. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Thermomagnetic and magneto-optical effects are two fundamental but
   unique phenomena existing in magnetic materials. In this work, we
   demonstrate ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect
   (TR-MOKE) as an advanced thermal characterization technique by studying
   the original factors of the MOKE signal from four magnetic transducers,
   including TbFe, GdFeCo, Co/Pd, and CoFe/Pt. A figure of merit is
   proposed to evaluate the performance of the transducer layers,
   corresponding to the degree of the signal-to-noise ratio in TR-MOKE
   measurements. We observe improved figure of merit for rare-earth
   transition-metal-based TbFe and GdFeCo transducers and attribute this
   improvement to their relatively larger temperature-dependent
   magnetization and the Kerr rotation angle at the saturated magnetization
   state. Furthermore, an optimal thickness of TbFe is found to be similar
   to 18.5 nm to give the best performance. Our findings will facilitate
   the nanoscale thermal characterization and the device design where the
   thermo-magneto-optical coupling plays an important role.}},

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is a critical, geographically concentrated, nonrenewable
   resource necessary to support global food production. In excess (e.g.,
   due to runoff or wastewater discharges), P is also a primary cause of
   eutrophication. To reconcile the simultaneous shortage and overabundance
   of P, lost P flows must be recovered and reused, alongside improvements
   in P-use efficiency. While this motivation is increasingly being
   recognized, little P recovery is practiced today, as recovered P
   generally cannot compete with the relatively low cost of mined P.
   Therefore, P is often captured to prevent its release into the
   environment without beneficial recovery and reuse. However, additional
   incentives for P recovery emerge when accounting for the total value of
   P recovery. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the range
   of benefits of recovering P from waste streams, i.e., the total value of
   recovering P. This approach accounts for P products, as well as other
   assets that are associated with P and can be recovered in parallel, such
   as energy, nitrogen, metals and minerals, and water. Additionally, P
   recovery provides valuable services to society and the environment by
   protecting and improving environmental quality, enhancing efficiency of
   waste treatment facilities, and improving food security and social
   equity. The needs to make P recovery a reality are also discussed,
   including business models, bottlenecks, and policy and education
   strategies.}},

Abstract = {{The spreading of droplets may be influenced by electric fields, a
   situation that is relevant to applications such as coating, printing,
   and microfluidics. In this work we study the effects of an electric
   field on the gravity-driven spreading of two-dimensional droplets down
   an inclined plane. We consider both perfect and leaky dielectric
   liquids, as well as perfectly and partially wetting systems. In addition
   to the effects of electric fields, we examine the use of thermocapillary
   forces to suppress the growth of the capillary ridge near the droplet
   front. Lubrication theory is applied to generate a set of coupled
   partial differential equations for interfacial height and charge, which
   are then solved numerically with a finite-difference method. Electric
   fields increase the height of the capillary ridge in both perfect and
   leaky dielectric droplets due to electrostatic pressure gradients that
   drive liquid into the ridge. In leaky dielectrics, large interfacial
   charge gradients in the contact-line region create shear stresses that
   also enhance ridge growth and the formation of trailing minor ridges.
   The coalescence of these ridges can significantly affect the long-time
   thinning rate of leaky dielectric droplets. In partially wetting
   liquids, electric fields promote the splitting of smaller droplets from
   the primary droplet near the receding contact line due to the interplay
   between electrostatic forces and disjoining pressure. Cooling from below
   and heating from above generates thermocapillary forces that counteract
   the effects of electric fields and suppress the growth of the capillary
   ridge. The results of this work have important implications for
   manipulating the spreading of droplets down inclined surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic tunnel junctions with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are
   investigated using a conductive atomic force microscope. The 1.23-nm
   Co40Fe40B20 recording layer coercivity exhibits a size dependence which
   suggests single-domain behavior for diameters <= 100 nm. Focusing on
   devices with diameters smaller than 100 nm, we determine the effect of
   voltage and size on the effective device anisotropy K-eff using two
   different techniques. K-eff is extracted both from distributions of the
   switching fields of the recording and reference layers and from
   measurement of thermal fluctuations of the recording layer magnetization
   when a field close to the switching field is applied. The results from
   both sets of measurements reveal that K-eff increases monotonically with
   decreasing junction diameter, consistent with the size dependence of the
   demagnetization energy density. We demonstrate that K-eff can be
   controlled with a voltage down to the smallest size measured, 64 nm.}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A unified chemo-mechanical model is developed to simulate stress
   corrosion cracking (SCC) of high density polyethylene (HDPE) in a
   chlorinated environment. The model consists of three components, each of
   which captures a critical aspect of SCC. A chemical kinetics-diffusion
   model is used to simulate the reactions and migration of chemical
   substances. The fracture behavior of HDPE is captured by a cohesive
   crack model, in which the cohesive properties are considered to be
   dependent on the extent of the chemical degradations. The time-dependent
   creep behavior of the bulk HDPE material is described by an
   elastic-viscoplastic constitutive model. This chemo-mechanical model is
   numerically implemented for finite element (FE) analysis of SCC of HDPE
   structures. The simulations show two different failure mechanisms
   depending on the applied stress level: at high stresses, the failure is
   primarily due to the excessive plastic deformation whereas at low
   stresses the chemical reactions and diffusion are the dominant factors
   leading to failure. In addition, examination of detailed crack growth
   kinetics reveals that at low stress levels the disinfectant
   concentration has a significant effect on the crack growth behavior
   through the relative dominance between the chemical reaction and
   diffusion processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Novel deep brain stimulation (DBS) paradigms are being
   explored in an effort to further optimize therapeutic outcome for
   patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). One approach, termed
   `Coordinated Reset' (CR) DBS, was developed to target pathological
   oscillatory network activity. with desynchronizing effects and
   associated therapeutic benefit hypothesized to endure beyond cessation
   of stimulus delivery.
   Objective: To characterize the acute and carry-over effects of
   low-intensity CR DBS versus traditional DBS (tDBS) in the region of the
   subthalamic nucleus (STN).
   Methods: A within-subject, block treatment design involving the
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) non-human primate
   model of parkinsonism was used. Each treatment block consisted of five
   days of daily DBS delivery followed by a one week minimum post-treatment
   observation window. Motor behavior was quantified using a modified
   rating scale for both animals combined with an objective,
   upper-extremity reach task in one animal.
   Results: Both animals demonstrated significant motor improvements during
   acute tDBS; however, within-session and post-treatment carry-over was
   limited. Acute motor improvements were also observed in response to
   low-intensity CR DBS; however, both within-and between-session
   therapeutic carry-over enhanced progressively following each daily
   treatment. Moreover, in contrast to tDBS, five consecutive days of CR
   DBS treatment yielded carry-over benefits that persisted for up to two
   weeks without additional intervention. Notably, the magnitude and
   time-course of CR DBS' effects on each animal varied with daily
   dose-duration, pointing to possible interaction effects involving
   baseline parkinsonian severity.
   Conclusion: Our results support the therapeutic promise of CR DBS for
   PD, including its potential to induce carryover while reducing both side
   effect risk and hardware power consumption. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{We fabricate a new type of plasmonic resonator, called a cup resonator,
   consisting of a single nanohole and a cylindrical surrounding reflector.
   This device is made using template stripping, which creates a smooth
   silver surface for the base along with a sidewall mirror in one step to
   form a compact plasmonic microcavity. When a cup resonator is
   illuminated, surface plasmon waves, launched by a nanohole in all
   directions, are reflected off of the cylindrical sidewall, generating
   cavity resonances that can be observed as interference patterns in the
   optical transmission spectra. Since the resonances inside the cup depend
   on the local refractive index, this device can function as a compact
   optical sensor. With this sensor we observe a bulk index sensitivity of
   390 nm/refractive index unit (RIU). A major advantage of this system
   over other propagation-based plasmonic sensors is that the energy is
   confined within a single cup, which is on the order of 1 mu m(2). This
   means that large arrays can be fabricated and used for parallel ensemble
   sensing and imaging applications.}},

Title = {{Testing the Efficacy of Pharmacological Agents in a Pericardial Target

Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{To date, many pharmacological agents used to treat or prevent
   arrhythmias in open-heart cases create undesired systemic side effects.
   For example, antiarrhythmic drugs administered intravenously can produce
   drops in systemic pressure in the already compromised cardiac patient.
   While performing open-heart procedures, surgeons will often either
   create a small port or form a pericardial cradle to create suitable
   fields for operation. This access yields opportunities for target
   pharmacological delivery (antiarrhythmic or ischemic preconditioning
   agents) directly to the myocardial tissue without undesired side
   effects.
   We have developed a swine model for testing pharmacological agents for
   target delivery within the pericardial fluid. While fully anesthetized,
   each animal was instrumented with a Swan-Ganz catheter as well as left
   and right ventricle pressure catheters, and pacing leads were placed in
   the right atrial appendage and the right ventricle. A medial sternotomy
   was then performed and a pericardial access cradle was created; a plunge
   pacing lead was placed in the left atrial appendage and a bipolar pacing
   lead was placed in the left ventricle. Utilizing a programmer and a
   cardiac mapping system, the refractory period of the atrioventricular
   node (AVN), atria and ventricles was determined. In addition, atrial
   fibrillation (AF) induction was produced utilizing a Grass stimulator
   and time in AF was observed. These measurements were performed prior to
   treatment, as well as 30 min and 60 min after pericardial treatment.
   Additional time points were added for selected studies. The heart was
   then cardiopleged and reanimated in a four chamber working mode.
   Pressure measurements and function were recorded for 1 hr after
   reanimation. This treatment strategy model allowed us to observe the
   effects of pharmacological agents that may decrease the incidence of
   cardiac arrhythmias and/or ischemic damage, during and after open-heart
   surgery.}},

Abstract = {{Rhizopus chinensis cells immobilized on loofah (Luffa cylindrica)
   sponges were used to produce biodiesel via the transesterification of
   soybean oil. In whole-cell immobilization, loofah sponge is considered
   to be a superior alternative to conventional biomass carriers because of
   its biodegradable and renewable properties. During cell cultivation,
   Rhizopus chinensis mycelia can spontaneously and firmly adhere to the
   surface of loofah sponge particles. The optimal conditions for
   processing 9.65 g soybean oil at 40 degrees C and 180 rpm using a 3: 1
   methanol-to-oil molar ratio were found to be 8\% cell addition and
   3-10\% water content (depending on the oil's weight). Under optimal
   conditions, an over 90\% methyl ester yield was achieved after the first
   reaction batch. The operational stability of immobilized Rhizopus
   chinensis cells was assayed utilizing a 1: 1 methanol-to-oil molar
   ratio, thus resulting in a 16.5-fold increase in half-life when compared
   with immobilized cells of the widely studied Rhizopus oryzae. These
   results suggest that transesterification of vegetable oil using Rhizopus
   chinensis whole cells immobilized onto loofah sponge is an effective
   approach for biodiesel production.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a novel, closed-loop approach to tuning deep brain
   stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD). The approach, termed
   Phasic Burst Stimulation (PhaBS), applies a burst of stimulus pulses
   over a range of phases predicted to disrupt pathological oscillations
   seen in PD. Stimulation parameters are optimized based on phase response
   curves (PRCs), which would be measured from each patient. This approach
   is tested in a computational model of PD with an emergent population
   oscillation. We show that the stimulus phase can be optimized using the
   PRC, and that PhaBS is more effective at suppressing the pathological
   oscillation than a single phasic stimulus pulse. PhaBS provides a
   closed-loop approach to DBS that can be optimized for each patient.}},

Abstract = {{MapReduce has proven remarkably effective for a wide variety of
   data-intensive applications, but it was designed to run on large
   single-site homogeneous clusters. Researchers have begun to explore the
   extent to which the original MapReduce assumptions can be relaxed,
   including skewed workloads, iterative applications, and heterogeneous
   computing environments. This paper continues this exploration by
   applying MapReduce across geo-distributed data over geo-distributed
   computation resources. Using Hadoop, we show that network and node
   heterogeneity and the lack of data locality lead to poor performance,
   because the interaction of MapReduce phases becomes pronounced in the
   presence of heterogeneous network behavior. To address these problems,
   we take a two-pronged approach: We first develop a model-driven
   optimization that serves as an oracle, providing high-level insights. We
   then apply these insights to design cross-phase optimization techniques
   that we implement and demonstrate in a real-world MapReduce
   implementation. Experimental results in both Amazon EC2 and PlanetLab
   show the potential of these techniques as performance is improved by
   7-18 percent depending on the execution environment and application.}},

Abstract = {{This work is aimed to study the effect of unsaturation degree on
   microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of fatty acid salts. Sodium stearate,
   sodium oleate, and sodium linoleate were selected as model compounds.
   MAP of sodium oleate obtained the highest yield of liquid product. GC MS
   analysis of liquid product revealed that MAP of unsaturated fatty acid
   salt could produce alkadienes, cycloalkanes, cycloalkenes, alkynes and
   aromatics, which could not appear in liquid product obtained from MAP of
   saturated fatty acid salt, and unsaturation degree had a great influence
   on liquid product composition. Analysis of the gas product indicated
   that MAP of sodium oleate produced more CO2 and CO, while the MAP of
   sodium linoleate produced more gaseous hydrocarbons and H-2. Analysis of
   the solid char showed that MAP of unsaturated fatty acid salts favors
   the cyclization and aromatization of pyrolysis vapours. The properties
   of liquid product were measured and analyzed, which confirmed that MAP
   of fatty acid salts is a feasible technology to produce high-quality
   renewable hydrocarbon fuels. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technology of two-step fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis (fMAP)
   of corn stover for bio-oil production was investigated in the presence
   of microwave absorbent (SiC) and HZSM-5 catalyst. Effects of fMAP
   temperature and catalyst-to-biomass ratio on bio-oil yield and chemical
   components were examined. The results showed that this technology,
   employing microwave, microwave absorbent and HZSM-5 catalyst, was
   effective and promising for biomass fast pyrolysis. The fMAP temperature
   of 500 degrees C was considered the optimum condition for maximum yield
   and best quality of bio-oil. Besides, the bio-oil yield decreased
   linearly and the chemical components in bio-oil were improved
   sequentially with the increase of catalyst-to-biomass ratio from 1:100
   to 120. The elemental compositions of bio-char were also determined.
   Additionally, compared to one-step fMAP process, two-step fMAP could
   promote the bio-oil quality with a smaller catalyst-to-biomass ratio.

Abstract = {{Alkali-soluble resins (ASRs) are a special type of polymeric surfactant
   containing both hydrophobic moieties and carboxylic acid functional
   groups. Upon ionization, ASRs provide electrosteric stabilization to the
   latex particles, thus allowing reduction or even elimination of
   conventional surfactants while maintaining or improving latex stability.
   The distribution of ASR in the dried film depends on its miscibility
   with the latex polymer. Its presence in the blend system is expected to
   alter the film formation process and consequently performance properties
   of paint products based on the latex blends containing ASR. In this
   study, the effects of a high Tg, alkali-soluble resin (ASR),
   poly(styrene/alpha-methylstyrene/acrylic acid) terpolymer on the
   properties of latex and paint films were examined. The film formation of
   a soft acrylic latex in the absence and presence of the ASR was
   evaluated using a variety of analytical techniques. As expected, paint
   properties such as scrub resistance, wet adhesion, and block resistance
   were also affected by the inclusion of ASR. The results provide new
   insights into the structure and surface morphology of latex and paint
   films containing ASRs, as well as their impact on mechanical and the
   performance properties.}},

Abstract = {{ScaffoldSeq is software designed for the numerous applications-including
   directed evolution analysis-in which a user generates a population of
   DNA sequences encoding for partially diverse proteins with related
   functions and would like to characterize the single site and pairwise
   amino acid frequencies across the population. A common scenario for
   enzyme maturation, antibody screening, and alternative scaffold
   engineering involves naive and evolved populations that contain
   diversified regions, varying in both sequence and length, within a
   conserved framework. Analyzing the diversified regions of such
   populations is facilitated by high-throughput sequencing platforms;
   however, length variability within these regions (e.g., antibody CDRs)
   encumbers the alignment process. To overcome this challenge, the
   ScaffoldSeq algorithm takes advantage of conserved framework sequences
   to quickly identify diverse regions. Beyond this, unintended biases in
   sequence frequency are generated throughout the experimental workflow
   required to evolve and isolate clones of interest prior to DNA
   sequencing. ScaffoldSeq software uniquely handles this issue by
   providing tools to quantify and remove background sequences, cluster
   similar protein families, and dampen the impact of dominant clones. The
   software produces graphical and tabular summaries for each region of
   interest, allowing users to evaluate diversity in a site-specific manner
   as well as identify epistatic pairwise interactions. The code and
   detailed information are freely available at

   SrTiO3 to reveal its nanoscale transport properties. At electron
   densities approaching 10(15) cm(-2), our terahertz spectroscopy data
   show conductivity levels that are up to six times larger than those
   extracted from DC electrical measurements. Moreover, the largest
   conductivity enhancements are observed in samples intentionally grown
   with larger defect densities. This is a signature of electron transport
   over the characteristic length-scales typically probed by electrical
   measurements being significantly affected by scattering by structural
   defects introduced during growth, and, a trait of a much larger electron
   mobility at the nanoscale. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Scaling effects relating the maneuvering capabilities of a vehicle and
   the scale characteristics of a task environment play an important role
   in how the performance of a guidance system plays out. These effects are
   most significant for unmanned aerial vehicles because they are built in
   a much broader range of scales than manned vehicles. This paper
   investigates how scaling effects should be accounted for in the
   evaluation of guidance performance. It proposes a nondimensional
   quantity called the maneuvering environment scale ratio that captures
   the relationship between the maneuvering limits of a vehicle and the
   scale characteristics of a task environment. This paper also formalizes
   the idea of agent-environment dynamic fit for guidance tasks and uses
   the maneuvering environment scale ratio to measure the fit. A task
   includes the vehicle dynamics, task environment, and mission objective.
   Agent-environment dynamic fit for a task is measured both quantitatively
   and qualitatively using the maneuvering environment scale ratio
   trajectory for an optimal solution. Finally, the paper demonstrates the
   application of the maneuvering environment scale ratio for quantifying
   the dynamic fit between an agent (guidance system) and environment using
   examples motivated by recent work in guidance systems benchmarking.}},

Title = {{HuR Contributes to TRAIL Resistance by Restricting Death Receptor 4
   Expression in Pancreatic Cancer Cells}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR CANCER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{599-611}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is one of the most lethal
   cancers, in part, due to resistance to both conventional and targeted
   therapeutics. TRAIL directly induces apoptosis through engagement of
   cell surface Death Receptors (DR4 and DR5), and has been explored as a
   molecular target for cancer treatment. Clinical trials with recombinant
   TRAIL and DR-targeting agents, however, have failed to show overall
   positive outcomes. Herein, we identify a novel TRAIL resistance
   mechanism governed by Hu antigen R (HuR, ELAV1), a stress-response
   protein abundant and functional in PDA cells. Exogenous HuR
   overexpression in TRAIL-sensitive PDA cell lines increases TRAIL
   resistance whereas silencing HuR in TRAIL-resistant PDA cells, by siRNA
   oligo-transfection, decreases TRAIL resistance. PDA cell exposure to
   soluble TRAIL induces HuR translocation from the nucleus to the
   cytoplasm. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that HuR interacts with the
   3'-untranslated region (UTR) of DR4 mRNA. Pretreatment of PDA cells with
   MS-444 (Novartis), an established small molecule inhibitor of HuR,
   substantially increased DR4 and DR5 cell surface levels and enhanced
   TRAIL sensitivity, further validating HuR's role in affecting TRAIL
   apoptotic resistance. NanoString analyses on the transcriptome of
   TRAIL-exposed PDA cells identified global HuR-mediated increases in
   antiapoptotic processes. Taken together, these data extend HuR's role as
   a key regulator of TRAIL-induced apoptosis.
   Implications: Discovery of an important new HuR-mediated TRAIL
   resistance mechanism suggests that tumor-targeted HuR inhibition
   increases sensitivity to TRAIL-based therapeutics and supports their
   re-evaluation as an effective treatment for PDA patients. (C)2016 AACR.}},

Abstract = {{Plant transformation has enabled fundamental insights into plant biology
   and revolutionized commercial agriculture. Unfortunately, for most
   crops, transformation and regeneration remain arduous even after more
   than 30 years of technological advances. Genome editing provides novel
   opportunities to enhance crop productivity but relies on genetic
   transformation and plant regeneration, which are bottlenecks in the
   process. Here, we review the state of plant transformation and point to
   innovations needed to enable genome editing in crops. Plant tissue
   culture methods need optimization and simplification for efficiency and
   minimization of time in culture. Currently, specialized facilities exist
   for crop transformation. Single-cell and robotic techniques should be
   developed for high-throughput genomic screens. Plant genes involved in
   developmental reprogramming, wound response, and/or homologous
   recombination should be used to boost the recovery of transformed
   plants. Engineering universal Agrobacterium tumefaciens strains and
   recruiting other microbes, such as Ensifer or Rhizobium, could
   facilitate delivery of DNA and proteins into plant cells. Synthetic
   biology should be employed for de novo design of transformation systems.
   Genome editing is a potential game-changer in crop genetics when plant
   transformation systems are optimized.}},

Abstract = {{In conventional heat-assisted magnetic recording media, the recording
   layer also acts as the storage layer. To minimize the effect of Tc
   variance, a new composite structure with a superparamagnetic writing
   layer is proposed to decouple the recording problem from the long-term
   storage issue. The thermal switching probability distribution (SPD) was
   calculated using 1 nm x 1 nmx1 nm renormalized parameters of FePt.
   Analytical derivation and micro-magnetic simulation results both show
   the volume dependence of the SPD: Width alpha 1/(Volume)(1/2). The SPD
   of the composite structure designed in this paper has a full-width
   half-maximum of 44 K, which is 20\% narrower than that found in an FePt
   recording layer subject to 3\% Tc variance.}},

Abstract = {{The material properties, magnetic damping and anisotropy, which are
   critical to spin-transfer-torque magnetic random access memory device
   performance, are theoretically explored for Fe/Pd superlattices
   deposited in the (001) orientation. Various superlattice geometries at
   different Fe and Pd layer thicknesses show perpendicular anisotropy.
   With the inclusion of the shape anisotropy, thin-film structures with an
   effective anisotropy of 1.4 x 10(7) erg/cm(3) have been observed. The
   damping is enhanced due to the broken symmetry at the Pd interface. This
   interfacial contribution increases when more Pd monolayers are deposited
   in the superlattice. The superlattice damping is relatively smaller than
   damping (alpha) in the L1(0) phase FePd. The optimized superlattices are
   3Fe/3Pd or 3Fe/2Pd: these multilayers have sufficient energy barriers
   (similar to 1 eV) to maintain thermal stability in very small devices,
   yet the switching currents are low (<5 x 10(6) A/cm(2)) and, thus,
   expected to lower the energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional magnetic recording is a promising candidate to further
   extend the areal density above 1 Tb/in(2) density while using a
   conventional writer and media. During the writing process, a shingled
   writer is usually used to write narrow tracks by overlapping previous
   tracks, which brings severe intertrack interference (ITI), fewer grains
   per channel bit and corresponding lower signal-tonoise ratio (SNR). As a
   consequence, for the current shingled magnetic recording system, a
   normally oriented head array (NHA) is usually implemented to detect a
   single track by using 2-D signal processing to mitigate the ITI and
   media noise. Then, a rotated head array (RHA) has been found to
   effectively avoid the ITI and regain the lost down-track resolution
   using signal processing. Correspondingly, in this paper, the RHA is
   investigated to simultaneously detect three tracks with 1-D and joint
   pattern-dependent noise-predictive (PDNP) Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv
   (BCJR) detectors. Simulation indicates that, for the perfect writing at
   the 6 nm Voronoi grains, if the 1-D PDNP BCJR detector is implemented,
   the RHA combined with a designed 2-D equalizer producing multiple
   equalized waveforms can provide 16\% density gains compared with the NHA
   with a 2-D equalizer and 1-D target at the target bit error rate (BER)
   of 10(-2). If the joint PDNP BCJR detector is implemented, the RHA can
   provide 25\% density gain compared with that for the NHA with the same
   detection algorithm at the target BER of 10(-2). With respect to error
   correction, a longer codeword length of binary low density parity check
   code can be used for decoding of the multi-track detection compared with
   that for the single-track detection, which provides an extra SNR gain.}},

   can collect phase lag and voltage ratio information and insert these

Abstract = {{The embedded mask patterning (EMP) process provides a potential L10-FePt
   media solution for 1-10 Tbit/in(2) magnetic recording areal density
   level. Methanol/Ar reactive ion etch process of FePt media (Ru 2 nm/FePt
   8 nm) in EMP is investigated using an ion-neutral-redep synergy etch
   rate model with the consideration of sputtered redeposition. It has been
   found that etching of high aspect ratio features spacing that is largely
   limited by its low etch rate due to high redeposition rate; etching of
   small size grains is mostly limited by hard mask erosion through the
   etching process. This would cause etch non-uniformity within the grain
   size and grain spacing distribution. The hard mask on top of the small
   size grains (i.e., less than 3 nm) erodes much faster than the larger
   size gains, resulting in a completely consumed mask before the
   underlying layers are reached. It is important to reduce local ion
   sputtering in order to minimize mask erosion for the small grains. We
   have found that a higher chemical etch selectivity (>30:1) is essential
   to minimize mask erosion on the grains of 2 nm or larger. We also report
   that when sputter yield of Ru mask and FePt is adjusted from 10(-1) to
   10(-2) level, further improvement is observed with the patterned grain
   size down to 2.5 nm and spacing down to 1.5 nm, and we suggest that the
   use of etch gas chemistry with a lighter atomic weight (such as He
   instead of Ar) would allow for sub-10 nm grain patterning.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a suite of algorithms to determine the active- and

   networks. The objective is to optimize the operation of the distribution

   widely studied ac optimal power flow (OPF) problem. For the envisioned
   application domain, nonlinear power-flow constraints render pertinent
   OPF problems nonconvex and computationally intensive for large systems.
   To address these concerns, we formulate a quadratic constrained
   quadratic program (QCQP) by leveraging a linear approximation of the
   algebraic power-flow equations. Furthermore, simplification from QCQP to
   a linearly constrained quadratic program is provided under certain
   conditions. The merits of the proposed approach are demonstrated with

   was used to fabricate the new composite in this study. Two sets of
   specimens containing 30 and 50vol\% lead zirconate titanate were
   prepared using normal mixing and spread methods, followed by the
   characterization of the properties of the composites. The composite
   exhibited desirable piezoelectric strain and voltage coefficients.
   Furthermore, the dielectric constant and loss of the composite were also
   determined. The results indicated that the piezoelectric effect and
   dielectric constant were enhanced with increasing lead zirconate
   titanate content. Compressive tests were conducted to study the sensing
   effect of the composite. The investigation demonstrated the feasibility
   of using the new composite as sensors in structural health monitoring
   systems to prevent possible failure of civil structures.}},

   electron probe reveal that the evolution of the probe intensity with

   transfer, accounting for observed thickness-dependent bonding
   sensitivity of contrast in all ADF-STEM imaging conditions. Because
   changes in image contrast relative to conventional neutral atom
   simulations scale directly with the net interatomic charge transfer, the
   strongest effects are seen in crystals with highly polar bonding, while
   no effects are seen for nonpolar bonding. Although the bonding
   dependence of ADF-STEM image contrast varies with detector geometry,

Abstract = {{Iron oxide nanoparticles have great potential as diagnostic and
   therapeutic agents in cancer and other diseases; however, biological
   aggregation severely limits their function in vivo. Aggregates can cause
   poor biodistribution, reduced heating capability, and can confound their
   visualization and quantification by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Herein, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a functionalized
   mesoporous silica shell can prevent aggregation and enable the practical
   use of high-heating, high-contrast iron oxide nano particles in vitro
   and in vivo. Unmodified and mesoporous silica-coated iron oxide
   nanoparticles were characterized in biologically relevant environments
   including phosphate buffered saline, simulated body fluid, whole mouse
   blood, lymph node carcinoma of prostate (LNCaP) cells, and after direct
   injection into LNCaP prostate cancer tumors in nude mice. Once coated,
   iron oxide nanoparticles maintained colloidal stability along with high
   heating and relaxivity behaviors (SAR(Fe) = 204 W/g Fe at 190 kHz and 20
   kA/m and r(1) = 6.9 mM(-1) s(-1) at 1.4 T). Colloidal stability and
   minimal nonspecific cell uptake allowed for effective heating in salt
   and agarose suspensions and strong signal enhancement in MR imaging in
   vivo. These results show that (1) aggregation can lower the heating and
   imaging performance of magnetic nanoparticles and (2) a coating of
   functionalized mesoporous silica can mitigate this issue, potentially
   improving clinical planning and practical use.}},

Abstract = {{As China is receiving an economic boom, PM (particulate matter)
   pollutions not only have become a serious regional problem but also
   frequently impacted its neighboring counties, e.g., Korea and Japan. In
   addition to its adverse effects on human health, the on-and off-road
   engines operated in ambient can also be affected. In this study, a
   simple system for generating simulated ambient bimodal PMs comprising
   fine (PM2.5), coarse (PM2.5-10) particles was developed for evaluating
   the initial efficiency of seven respirator and four engine intake
   filters. In addition to the size fractional efficiency curves for each
   filter media determined from the SMPS (scanning mobility particle sizer)
   and APS (aerodynamic particle sizer), both number and mass based
   efficiency of these filters for PM2.5, PM2.5-10 and PM10 were also
   obtained to evaluate their performances against ambient PM pollutions.
   Data showed that the engine intake filters had a low efficiency for both
   mass and number based PM2.5, which was only about 25-30\%. However,
   there was a large difference between their number and mass based PM10
   efficiency. The former was much lower than the latter because these
   filters are with high efficiency only for coarse particles. Besides, the
   most of particles in number was resided in the fine size range while the
   mass was in coarse size range. For the respirator filtration tests,
   results showed that most of them can effectively remove both PM2.5 and
   PM10, in which the mass efficiency was always higher than that of
   number. The PM2.5 number efficiency results showed there are three out
   of seven respirator filters are with N-95 rated level, in which the
   efficiency of their most penetrating particle size is higher than 95\%.
   The current simple experimental system could be applied to examine
   different purpose filters which protect human health and outdoor engines
   against ambient PM2.5 and PM10.}},

Abstract = {{This review article describes the design of static controllers that
   achieve an optimal tradeoff between closed-loop performance and
   controller structure. Our methodology consists of two steps. First, we
   identify controller structure by incorporating regularization functions
   into the optimal control problem and, second, we optimize the controller
   over the identified structure. For large-scale networks of dynamical
   systems, the desired structural property is captured by limited
   information exchange between physical and controller layers and the
   regularization term penalizes the number of communication links.
   Although structured optimal control problems are, in general, nonconvex,
   we identify classes of convex problems that arise in the design of
   symmetric systems, undirected consensus and synchronization networks,
   optimal selection of sensors and actuators, and decentralized control of
   positive systems. Examples of consensus networks, drug therapy design,
   sensor selection in flexible wing aircrafts, and optimal wide-area
   control of power systems are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness
   of the framework. (C) 2016 European Control Association. Published by

Abstract = {{Energy management strategies for a power-split hydraulic hybrid wheel
   loader are studied in this paper. The differences between the powertrain
   and the energy management system for on-road vehicles and the powertrain
   and the energy management system for off-road vehicles are first
   identified. Unlike on-road vehicles where the engine powers only the
   drivetrain, the engine in a wheel loader powers both the drivetrain and
   the working hydraulic system. In a non-hybrid wheel loader, the two
   subsystems interfere with each other since they share the same engine
   shaft. By using a power-split powertrain, this not only allows for
   optimal engine operation and regenerative braking but also greatly
   reduces the interference between the drivetrain and the working
   functions. An energy management strategy based on dynamic programming is
   developed to give full system optimization including both the drivetrain
   and the working functions. Both a long loading cycle and a short loading
   cycle are studied in this paper. The dynamic-programming-based strategy
   is compared with a rule-based strategy using simulation studies.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue organoids are a promising technology that may accelerate
   development of the societal and NIH mandate for precision medicine. Here
   we describe a robust and simple method for generating cerebral organoids
   (cOrgs) from human pluripotent stem cells by using a chemically defined
   hydrogel material and chemically defined culture medium. By using no
   additional neural induction components, cOrgs appeared on the hydrogel
   surface within 10-14 days, and under static culture conditions, they
   attained sizes up to 3 mm in greatest dimension by day 28.
   Histologically, the organoids showed neural rosette and neural tube-like
   structures and evidence of early corticogenesis. Immunostaining and
   quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction
   demonstrated protein and gene expression representative of forebrain,
   midbrain, and hindbrain development. Physiologic studies showed
   responses to glutamate and depolarization in many cells, consistent with
   neural behavior. The method of cerebral organoid generation described
   here facilitates access to this technology, enables scalable
   applications, and provides a potential pathway to translational
   applications where defined components are desirable.}},

Abstract = {{This research presents an integrated optimal controller to maximize the
   fuel efficiency of a Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV) traveling on rolling
   terrain. The controller optimizes both the vehicle acceleration and the
   hybrid powertrain operation. It takes advantage of the emerging
   Connected Vehicle (CV) technology and utilizes present and future
   information as optimization input, which includes road topography, and
   dynamic speed limit. The optimal control problem was solved using
   Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP). Efforts were made to reduce the
   computational burden of the optimization process. The evaluation shows
   that the benefit of the proposed optimal controller is significant
   compared to regular HEV cruising at the speed limit on rolling terrain.
   The benefit ranges from 5.0\% to 8.9\% on mild slopes and from 15.7\% to
   16.9\% on steep slopes. The variation is caused by the change of hilly
   road density. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hypersaline lakes are characteristic for Western Australia and display a
   rare combination of geochemical and mineralogical properties that make
   these lakes potential analogues for past conditions on Mars. In our
   study, we focused on the geochemistry and mineralogy of Lake Orr and
   Lake Whurr. While both lakes are poor in organic carbon (<1\%), the
   sediments' pH values differ and range from 3.8 to 4.8 in Lake Orr and
   from 5.4 to 6.3 in Lake Whurr sediments. Lake Whurr sediments were
   dominated by orange and red sediment zones in which the main Fe minerals
   were identified as hematite, goethite, and tentatively jarosite and
   pyrite. Lake Orr was dominated by brownish and blackish sediments where
   the main Fe minerals were goethite and another paramagnetic
   Fe(III)-phase that could not be identified. Furthermore, a likely
   secondary Fe(II)-phase was observed in Lake Orr sediments. The
   mineralogy of these two salt lakes in the sampling area is strongly
   influenced by events such as flooding, evaporation, and desiccation,
   processes that explain at least to some extent the observed differences
   between Lake Orr and Lake Whurr. The iron mineralogy of Lake Whurr
   sediments and the high salinity make this lake a suitable analogue for
   Meridiani Planum on Mars, and in particular the tentative identification
   of pyrite in Lake Whurr sediments has implications for the
   interpretation of the Fe mineralogy of Meridiani Planum sediments.}},

Abstract = {{Limited energy in each node is the major design constraint in wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs). To overcome this limit, wireless rechargeable
   sensor networks (WRSNs) have been proposed and studied extensively over
   the last few years. In a typical WRSN, batteries in sensor nodes can be
   replenished by a mobile charger that periodically travels along a
   certain trajectory in the sensing area. To maximize the charged energy
   in sensor nodes, one fundamental question is how to control the
   traveling velocity of the charger. In this paper, we first identify the
   optimal velocity control as a key design objective of mobile wireless
   charging in WRSNs. We then formulate the optimal charger velocity
   control problem on arbitrarily-shaped irregular trajectories in a 2D
   space. The problem is proved to be NP-hard, and hence a heuristic
   solution with a provable upper bound is developed using novel spatial
   and temporal discretization. We also derive the optimal velocity control
   for moving the charger along a linear (1D) trajectory commonly seen in
   many WSN applications. Extensive simulations show that the network
   lifetime can be extended by 2.5 x with the proposed velocity control
   mechanisms.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{578-606}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose Virtual Id Routing (VIRO) a novel
   ``plug-\&-play{''} non-IP routing protocol for future dynamics networks.
   VIRO decouples routing/forwarding from addressing by introducing a
   topology-aware, structured virtual id layer to encode the locations of
   switches and devices in the physical topology. It completely eliminates
   network-wide flooding in both the data and control planes, and thus is
   highly scalable and robust. VIRO effectively localizes the effect of
   failures, performs fast re-routing and supports multiple (logical)
   topologies on top of the same physical network substrate to further
   enhance network robustness. We have implemented an initial prototype of
   VIRO using Open vSwitch, and we extend it (both within the user space
   and the kernel space) to implement VIRO switching functions in VIRO
   switches. In addition, we use the POX SDN controller to implement VIRO's
   control and management plane functions. We evaluate our prototype
   implementation through emulation and in the GENI (the Global Environment
   for Network Innovations) testbed using many synthetic and real
   topologies. Our evaluation results show that VIRO has better scalability
   than link-state based protocols (e.g. OSPF and SEATTLE) in terms of
   routing-table size and control overhead, as well as better mechanisms
   for failure recovery.}},

Abstract = {{In many practical applications of supervised learning the task involves
   the prediction of multiple target variables from a common set of input
   variables. When the prediction targets are binary the task is called
   multi-label classification, while when the targets are continuous the
   task is called multi-target regression. In both tasks, target variables
   often exhibit statistical dependencies and exploiting them in order to
   improve predictive accuracy is a core challenge. A family of multi-label
   classification methods address this challenge by building a separate
   model for each target on an expanded input space where other targets are
   treated as additional input variables. Despite the success of these
   methods in the multi-label classification domain, their applicability
   and effectiveness in multi-target regression has not been studied until
   now. In this paper, we introduce two new methods for multi-target
   regression, called stacked single-target and ensemble of regressor
   chains, by adapting two popular multi-label classification methods of
   this family. Furthermore, we highlight an inherent problem of these
   methods-a discrepancy of the values of the additional input variables
   between training and prediction-and develop extensions that use
   out-of-sample estimates of the target variables during training in order
   to tackle this problem. The results of an extensive experimental
   evaluation carried out on a large and diverse collection of datasets
   show that, when the discrepancy is appropriately mitigated, the proposed
   methods attain consistent improvements over the independent regressions
   baseline. Moreover, two versions of Ensemble of Regression Chains
   perform significantly better than four state-of-the-art methods
   including regularization-based multi-task learning methods and a
   multi-objective random forest approach.}},

Abstract = {{A simple engineering model for predicting wind farm performance is
   presented, which is applicable to wind farms of arbitrary size and
   turbine layout. For modeling the interaction of wind farm with the
   atmospheric boundary layer (ABL), the wind farm is represented as added
   roughness elements. The wind speed behind each turbine is calculated
   using a kinematic model, in which the friction velocity and the wind
   speed outside the turbine wake, constructed based on the wind farm-ABL
   interaction model, are employed to estimate the wake expansion rate in
   the crosswind direction and the maximum wind speed that can be recovered
   within the turbine wake, respectively. Validation of the model is
   carried out by comparing the model predictions with the measurements
   from wind tunnel experiments and the Horns Rev wind farm. For all
   validation cases, satisfactory agreement is obtained between model
   predictions and experimental data. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{This paper investigates tracking control in the rotational angle domain
   based on the time-varying internal model principle. The objective is to
   enable precise, reliable, and computationally efficient output tracking
   of signals that are dependent on angular displacement. To achieve
   desired performance, existing approaches based on internal model
   principle require a large number of samples per revolution, which
   significantly increases the controller order and also poses challenges
   for the transient performance. To address those issues, a varying
   sampling interval approach is proposed, where the angular sampling
   locations are not fixed but optimized based on tracking errors between
   sampling points so that desired performance can be achieved without
   increasing the number of samples. Meanwhile, to improve the convergence
   rate of the tracking error, additional linear matrix inequalities (LMI)
   constraints are added to the existing stabilizer synthesis. Through
   experimental study on a camless engine valve actuation system, the
   effectiveness of the proposed approaches is demonstrated. It is shown
   that, compared with the fixed interval sampling, the varying sampling
   approach can reduce the tracking error by over 50\%.}},

Abstract = {{Uncoordinated charging of large-scale electric vehicles (EVs) will have
   a negative impact on the secure and economic operation of the power
   system, especially at the distribution level. Given that the charging
   load of EVs can be controlled to some extent, research on the optimal
   charging control of EVs has been extensively carried out. In this paper,
   two possible smart charging scenarios in China are studied: centralized
   optimal charging operated by an aggregator and decentralized optimal
   charging managed by individual users. Under the assumption that the
   aggregators and individual users only concern the economic benefits, new
   load peaks will arise under time of use (TOU) pricing which is
   extensively employed in China. To solve this problem, a simple incentive
   mechanism is proposed for centralized optimal charging while a
   rolling-update pricing scheme is devised for decentralized optimal
   charging. The original optimal charging models are modified to account
   for the developed schemes. Simulated tests corroborate the efficacy of
   optimal scheduling for charging EVs in various scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{The composite minimization problem over a general polyhedron has
   received various applications in machine learning, wireless

   paper aims to provide a theoretical study on this problem. First, we
   derive the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality conditions for local
   minimizers of the problem. Second, we propose a smoothing sequential
   quadratic programming framework for solving this problem. The framework
   requires a (approximate) solution of a convex quadratic program at each
   iteration. Finally, we analyze the worst-case iteration complexity of
   the framework for returning an -KKT point; i.e., a feasible point that
   satisfies a perturbed version of the derived KKT optimality conditions.
   To the best of our knowledge, the proposed framework is the first one
   with a worst-case iteration complexity guarantee for solving composite
   minimization over a general polyhedron.}},

Abstract = {{Control of the size and material properties of silicon nanoparticles
   plays a critical role in optimizing applications using those
   nanoparticles, such as photovoltaics and biomedical devices. While
   synthesis of silicon nanoparticles in low temperature plasmas has many
   attractive features, the basic mechanisms leading to formation of
   nanoparticles in these plasmas are poorly understood. A two-dimensional
   numerical model for synthesis of silicon nanoparticles (< 5 nm in
   diameter) in radio frequency (RF) discharges was developed and used to
   investigate mechanisms for particle growth for Ar/He/SiH4 gas mixtures.
   Algorithms for the kinetics of nanoparticle formation were
   self-consistently embedded into a plasma hydrodynamics simulation to
   account for nucleation, growth, charging, and transport of
   nanoparticles. We found that with RF excitation in narrow tubes at
   pressures of a few Torr, the electric field does not fully confine
   charged nanoparticles in the axial direction, which then results in a
   finite residence time of particles in the plasma. We found that because
   of the high neutral nanoparticle density, coagulation plays a
   significant role in growth. The model predicts the possibility of
   synthesizing crystalline silicon nanoparticles under these conditions.
   Trends in the growth of nanoparticles as a function of power are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We review experimental and simulation approaches that have been used to
   determine curvature generation and remodeling of lipid bilayers by
   membrane-bending proteins. Particular emphasis is placed on the
   complementary approaches used to study alpha-Synuclein (alpha Syn), a
   major protein involved in Parkinson's disease (PD). Recent cellular and
   biophysical experiments have shown that the protein 1) deforms the
   native structure of mitochondrial and model membranes; and 2) inhibits
   vesicular fusion. Today's advanced experimental and computational
   technology has made it possible to quantify these protein-induced
   changes in membrane shape and material properties. Collectively,
   experiments, theory and multi-scale simulation techniques have
   established the key physical determinants of membrane remodeling and
   rigidity: protein binding energy, protein partition depth, protein
   density, and membrane tension. Despite the exciting and significant
   progress made in recent years in these areas, challenges remain in
   connecting biophysical insights to the cellular processes that lead to
   disease. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane

Abstract = {{Traditional methods for system-level design of Delta-Sigma (a dagger I )
   pound modulators typically assume linear modeling of the modulator, in
   which quantization noise is modeled as additive independent white noise.
   But it is well known that the a dagger I  pound modulator is a
   non-linear system and linear modeling is only an approximation. Also,
   circuit-level non-idealities, which may greatly change the modulator
   behavior, are typically neglected at system-level design. As a result,
   system-level modulator designs obtained from traditional methods may not
   be realistically optimal. This paper presents a system-level
   post-optimization method for a dagger I  pound modulators so that
   modulator designs initially obtained from traditional methods are
   post-optimized considering non-linear and non-ideal characteristics of a
   dagger I  pound modulators including both quantization noise and
   circuit-level non-idealities. The post-optimization algorithm is based
   on Finite Difference Stochastic Approximation due to the stochastic
   nature of modeling of some circuit-level non-idealities in system-level
   design. During the post-optimization run, each candidate design is
   simulated for performance measures and stability has always been a must
   constraint. Results on two a dagger I  pound modulators have shown that
   post-optimized modulator designs outperform the original designs from
   traditional methods.}},

Abstract = {{While laboratory studies show that air pollutants can potentiate insulin
   resistance, the epidemiologic evidence regarding the association of air
   pollution with diabetes incidence is conflicting. The purpose of the
   present study was to assess the association of the traffic-related
   nitrogen dioxide (NO2) with the incidence of diabetes in a longitudinal
   cohort study of African American women. We used Cox proportional hazards
   models to calculate hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) for
   diabetes associated with exposure to NO2 among 43,003 participants in
   the Black Women's Health Study (BWHS). Pollutant levels at participant
   residential locations were estimated with 1) a land use regression model
   for participants living in 56 metropolitan areas, and 2) a dispersion
   model for participants living in 27 of the cities.
   From 1995 to 2011, 4387 cases of diabetes occurred. The hazard ratios
   per interquartile range of NO2 (9.7 ppb), adjusted for age, metropolitan
   area, education, vigorous exercise, body mass index, smoking, and diet,
   were 0.96 (95\% CI 0.88-1.06) using the land use regression model
   estimates and 0.94 (95\% CI 0.80, 1.10) using the dispersion model
   estimates. The present results do not support the hypothesis that
   exposure to NO2 contributes to diabetes incidence in African American
   women. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{86-102}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{LES of sheet to cloud cavitation over a wedge is performed at Reynolds
   number Re = 200, 000 (based on the wedge height and free stream
   velocity) and cavitation number sigma = 2.1. The attached sheet cavity
   grows upto a critical length, after which it breaks into a cloud cavity
   which is highly three-dimensional and vortical in nature. The mean and
   RMS void fraction profiles obtained inside the cavity are compared to
   experiment and good agreement is observed. The frequency of the shedding
   process is obtained from point spectra at several locations and the
   obtained frequency is found to agree with the experiment. It is observed
   that the mean pressure at the wedge apex does not fall below vapor
   pressure; however cavitation occurs there due to the unsteady pressure
   falling below vapor pressure. The maximum mean void fraction occurs in
   the sheet cavity and is about 0.5, while the cloud region has even
   lesser amount of void fraction. The velocity fluctuations immediately
   downstream of the cavity show comparable stream wise and spanwise
   values, while the spanwise values are smaller in comparison inside the
   cavity region. The probability density function of void fraction
   examined at several locations inside the cavity show that the mean value
   obtained from time averaged data is very different from the most
   probable value of void fraction, indicating the considerable
   unsteadiness of the flow. The pressure waves produced upon cloud
   collapse are found to display both cyclic behavior and small scale
   transient behavior downstream of the wedge. The LES results agree better
   with experiment than unsteady RANS in predicting this highly unsteady
   flow. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A new archive of heat transfer coefficients from square and chamfered
   cylinders at angles of attack in crossflow}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THERMAL SCIENCES}},

Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{218-223}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Calculations of convection heat transfer coefficients between a fluid in
   crossflow and two-dimensional square-cylindrical objects have been
   performed using numerical simulation. Some calculations included
   geometries with chamfered corners while others were sharp-edged. The
   numerical model allows a systematic study of various angles of attack
   and lengths of chamfer so that the entire range of angles and chamfers
   were investigated. It was found that the present results are in good
   agreement with previously published archival values for similar
   geometries and Reynolds numbers. In this regard, the present work
   significantly expands the upper bound of the Nusselt-Reynolds
   correlation.
   Comparison among the many investigated geometrical configurations
   reveals that more extensive chamfering results in a lowered dependence
   of the Nusselt number on the Reynolds number. In the lower range of the
   Reynolds numbers dealt with in this study, there was near parity in the
   Nusselt number values for square and octagonal chamfered cylinders;
   however, at the higher Reynolds number range (approximately 2,000,000),
   the octagon Nusselt numbers were similar to 80\% of those of the square
   for a zero-degree angle of attack. The largest angle of attack (45
   degrees) also exhibited Nusselt number values that were comparable for
   the square and octagonal shapes in the lower range of Reynolds numbers.
   However, at the higher Reynolds numbers, the results differed by
   approximately a factor of two (square cylinder Nusselt number is larger
   than the octagonal Nusselt number). The results calculated here for air
   are extended to other fluids by a simple calculation involving the ratio
   of Prandtl numbers. (C) 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers future distribution networks featuring
   inverter-interfaced photovoltaic (PV) systems, and addresses the
   synthesis of feedback controllers that seek real-and reactive-power
   inverter setpoints corresponding to AC optimal power flow (OPF)
   solutions. The objective is to bridge the temporal gap between long-term
   system optimization and real-time inverter control, and enable seamless
   PV-owner participation without compromising system efficiency and
   stability. The design of the controllers is grounded on a dual
   epsilon-subgradient method, while semidefinite programming relaxations
   are advocated to bypass the non-convexity of AC OPF formulations. Global
   convergence of inverter output powers is analytically established for
   diminishing stepsize rules for cases where: i) computational limits
   dictate asynchronous updates of the controller signals, and ii) inverter
   reference inputs may be updated at a faster rate than the power-output
   settling time.}},

Abstract = {{Combining algae cultivation and wastewater treatment for biofuel

   innovative approach consisting of microalgae cultivation on centrate
   wastewater, microalgae harvest through flocculation, solar drying of
   biomass, pyrolysis of biomass to bio-oil, and utilization of
   co-products, was analyzed and shown to yield profound positive results
   in comparison with others. The estimated break even selling price of
   biofuel (\$2.23/gallon) is very close to the acceptable level. The
   approach would have better overall benefits and the internal rate of

   plateaus with hexagonal features bounded by pleats and regions with
   disordered character. Nitrogen impurities are not observed in the

Abstract = {{With statistical mechanics, an isotherm-based surface tension model for
   single solute aqueous solutions was derived previously (Wexler et al. J.
   Phys. Chem. Lett. 2013) for the entire concentration range, from
   infinite dilution to pure liquid solute, as a function of solute
   activity. In recent work (Boyer et al. J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2015),
   empirical model parameters were reduced through physicochemical
   interpretations of both electrolyte and organic solutes, enabling
   surface tension predictions for systems where there is little or no
   data. The prior binary model is extended in the current work for the
   first time to treat multi component systems to predict surface tensions
   of partially dissociating organic acids (acetic, butyric, citric,
   formic, glutaric, maleic, malic, malonic, oxalic, propionic, and
   succinic acids). These organic acids are especially applicable to the
   study of atmospheric aqueous aerosols, due to their abundance in the
   atmosphere. In the model developed here, surface tension depends
   explicitly on activities of both the neutral organic and deprotonated
   components of the acid. The relative concentrations of the
   nondissociated and dissociated mole fractions are found using known
   dissociation constants. Model parameters strongly depend on molecular
   size, number of functional groups, O:C ratio, and number of carbons. For
   all organic acids in this study, fully predictive modeling of surface
   tensions is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) activation
   occurs frequently in human progenitor B-cell acute lymphoblastic
   leukemia (B-ALL). To identify gene alterations that cooperate with STAT5
   activation to initiate leukemia, we crossed mice expressing a
   constitutively active form of STAT5 (Stat5b-CA) with mice in which a
   mutagenic Sleeping Beauty transposon (T2/Onc) was mobilized only in B
   cells. Stat5b-CA mice typically do not develop B-ALL (<2\% penetrance);
   in contrast, 89\% of Stat5b-CA mice in which the T2/Onc transposon had
   been mobilized died of B-ALL by 3 months of age. High-throughput
   sequencing approaches were used to identify genes frequently targeted by
   the T2/Onc transposon; these included Sos1 (74\%), Kdm2a (35\%), Jak1
   (26\%), Bmi1 (19\%), Prdm14 or Ncoa2 (13\%), Cdkn2a (10\%), Ikzf1 (8\%),
   Caap1 (6\%) and Klf3 (6\%). Collectively, these mutations target three
   major cellular processes: (i) the Janus kinase/STAT5 pathway (ii)
   progenitor B-cell differentiation and (iii) the CDKN2A tumor-suppressor
   pathway. Transposon insertions typically resulted in altered expression
   of these genes, as well as downstream pathways including STAT5,
   extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and p38. Importantly,
   expression of Sos1 and Kdm2a, and activation of p38, correlated with
   survival, further underscoring the role these genes and associated
   pathways have in B-ALL.}},

Title = {{Iterative Bayesian Estimation of Travel Times on Urban Arterials: Fusing
   Loop Detector and Probe Vehicle Data}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 30}},
Abstract = {{On urban arterials, travel time estimation is challenging especially
   from various data sources. Typically, fusing loop detector data and
   probe vehicle data to estimate travel time is a troublesome issue while
   considering the data issue of uncertain, imprecise and even conflicting.
   In this paper, we propose an improved data fusing methodology for link
   travel time estimation. Link travel times are simultaneously
   pre-estimated using loop detector data and probe vehicle data, based on
   which Bayesian fusion is then applied to fuse the estimated travel
   times. Next, Iterative Bayesian estimation is proposed to improve
   Bayesian fusion by incorporating two strategies: 1) substitution
   strategy which replaces the lower accurate travel time estimation from
   one sensor with the current fused travel time; and 2) specially-designed
   conditions for convergence which restrict the estimated travel time in a
   reasonable range. The estimation results show that, the proposed method
   outperforms probe vehicle data based method, loop detector based method
   and single Bayesian fusion, and the mean absolute percentage error is
   reduced to 4.8\%. Additionally, iterative Bayesian estimation performs
   better for lighter traffic flows when the variability of travel time is
   practically higher than other periods.}},

Title = {{Combining Pre- and Post-Nucleation Trajectories for the Synthesis of
   High FAU-Content Faujasite Nanocrystals from Organic-Free Sols}},
Journal = {{CHEMISTRY OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{JUN 28}},
Abstract = {{The effects of synthesis conditions on the FAU/EMT content and the size
   of nanocrystals, formed from inorganic aluminosilicate sols, were
   investigated. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy imaging
   and comparison of experimental X-ray diffraction patterns with
   simulations demonstrated that all materials made starting from synthesis
   mixtures in the composition range (1.8-33) SiO2:1 Al2O3:(2.7-33) Na2O:
   (41-1000) H2O contain FAU/EMT intergrowths. Compositions with low water
   content increase the FAU fraction up to 0.8 but the crystal size exceeds
   100 nm. Extension of the higher FAU purity to nanocrystals was achieved
   only by first mixing the sol at high water content compositions that
   favor nanocrystal formation and then after a certain time lowering by
   freeze-drying the water to levels favoring the formation of FAU.
   Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray
   scattering from representative optically clear and colloidally stable
   precursor sols (aged and crystallized at ambient temperature) reveal the
   formation of amorphous aggregates before the detection of crystals, in
   agreement with earlier findings and an existing model for the
   aggregative growth of the zeolite MFI. The presence of these amorphous
   aggregates coincides with the aforementioned state of sol that preserves
   the original trajectory toward nanocrystals after the pronounced
   reduction of water content by freeze-drying. If water reduction by
   freeze-drying is applied earlier (before the detection of amorphous
   aggregates), the sol follows the low water content trajectory toward
   larger crystals. Despite this memory effect, the sol at this stage is
   still agnostic toward FAU or EMT formation, the relative content of
   which is dominantly determined by the final water content. These
   findings demonstrate that it is possible to combine the effects of pre-
   and post-nucleation sol composition to steer crystal size and crystal
   structure, respectively. They confirm precursor nanoparticle evolution,
   while they emphasize the importance of solution phase composition at
   both pre- and post-nucleation stages of aggregative crystal growth.}},

   approximate to 550 nm and localized surface plasmon resonance at
   approximate to 1900 cm(-1) due to oxygen vacancies. The particle size

   the increase of the crystal field splitting (Delta(CF)) and band gap
   energy (E-g). Agreement with experiment for the latter improves
   considerably with the use of DFT + U-sc and all trends are in good
   agreement with the experimental data. These trends enable a direct test
   of prior rationalizations of the trend in spin-gap associated with the
   spin crossover in this series, which is found to expose significant
   issues with simple band based arguments. We also examine the effect of
   placing the rare-earth f-electrons in the core region of the
   pseudopotential. The effect on lattice parameters and band structure is
   found to be small, but distinct for the special case of PrCoO3 where
   some f-states populate the middle of the gap, consistent with the recent
   reports of unique behavior in Pr-containing cobaltites. Overall, this
   study establishes a foundation for future predictive studies of
   thermally induced spin excitations in rare-earth cobaltites and similar
   systems. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{To improve the toughness and processability of poly(lactic acid) (PLA),
   a branched multiblock polymer was prepared from D,L-lactide and
   epsilon-decalactone. A hydroxy telechelic four-arm star
   poly(epsilon-decalactone)-poly(D,L-lactide) diblock was synthesized
   using sequential ring-opening transesterfication polymerization (ROTEP)
   and coupled using a substoichiometric amount of sebacoyl chloride to
   obtain a segmented multiblock with a comb-like architecture. Small-angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
   revealed that this branched multiblock was microphase separated but
   lacked long-range order. Unlike a linear multiblock of similar mass, the
   branched material demonstrated significant extensional hardening in the
   disordered state, suggesting much improved processability in polymer
   processing methods that require fast elongational flows. Additionally,
   the branched multiblock material exhibited remarkable tensile toughness.
   This simple synthetic approach allows for simultaneous control of
   mechanical and rheological properties using a single macromolecular
   architecture to address key practical issues with PLA.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{22}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{Damping, representing the loss of magnetic energy from the electrons to
   the lattice through the spin-orbit interaction, is calculated for Co/Pt
   and Co/Pd superlattices grown along the (001), (111), and (011)
   orientations. The damping consists of two contributions: interfacial
   and, usually, bulk. The interfacial damping shows dependence on the
   superlattice orientation. The origin of the interfacial damping is due
   to both the distorted electronic states at the interface and the
   spin-orbit interaction in the weakly polarized nonmagnetic Pt/Pd layers
   deposited on Co layers. The density of states around the Fermi level
   provides the spin-flip channels and closely correlates with the damping
   value. The damping shows asymmetry in the two transverse directions of
   the spin for spins at most angles. The damping for out-of-plane
   magnetization can be as much as 1.7 times larger than that of in-plane
   magnetization.}},

Abstract = {{Organic acids make up a significant fraction of the organic mass in
   atmospheric aerosol particles. The calculation of gas liquid solid
   equilibrium partitioning of the organic acid is therefore critical for
   accurate determination of atmospheric aerosol physicochemical properties
   and processes such as new particle formation and activation to cloud
   condensation nuclei. Previously, an adsorption isotherm based
   statistical thermodynamic model was developed for capturing solute
   concentration activity relationships for multicomponent aqueous
   solutions over the entire concentration range (Dutcher et al. J. Phys.
   Chem. C/A 2011, 2012, 2013), with model parameters for energies of
   adsorption successfully related to dipole dipole electrostatic forces in
   solute solvent and solvent solvent interactions for both electrolytes
   and organics (Ohm et al. J. Phys. Chem. A 2015). However, careful
   attention is needed for weakly dissociating semivolatile organic acids.
   Dicarboxylic acids, such as malonic acid and glutaric acid are treated
   here as a mixture of nondissociated organic solute (HA) and dissociated
   solute (H+ + A(-)). It was found that the apparent dissociation was
   greater than that predicted by known dissociation constants alone,
   emphasizing the effect of dissociation on osmotic and activity
   coefficient predictions. To avoid additional parametrization from the
   mixture approach, an expression was used to relate the Debye Hiickel
   hard-core collision diameter to the adjustable solute solvent
   intermolecular distance. An improved reference state treatment for
   electrolyte organic aqueous mixtures, such as that observed here with
   partial dissociation, has also been proposed. This work results in
   predictive correlations for estimation of organic acid and water
   activities for which there is little or no activity data.}},

Abstract = {{Predictive modeling of reaction equilibria presents one of the grand
   challenges in the field of molecular simulation. Difficulties in the
   study of such systems arise from the need (i) to accurately model both
   strong, short-ranged interactions leading to the formation of chemical
   bonds and weak interactions arising from the environment, and (ii) to
   sample the range of time scales involving frequent molecular collisions,
   slow diffusion, and infrequent reactive events. Here we present a novel
   reactive first-principles Monte Carlo (RxFPMC) approach that allows for
   investigation of reaction equilibria without the need to prespecify a
   set of chemical reactions and their ideal-gas equilibrium constants. We
   apply RxFPMC to investigate a nitrogen/oxygen mixture at T = 3000 K and
   p = 30 GPa, i.e., conditions that are present in atmospheric lightning
   strikes and explosions. The RxFPMC simulations show that the solvation
   environment leads to a significantly enhanced NO concentration that
   reaches a maximum when oxygen is present in slight excess. In addition,
   the RxFPMC simulations indicate the formation of NO2 and N2O in mole
   fractions approaching 1\%, whereas N-3 and O-3 are not observed. The
   equilibrium distributions obtained from the RxFPMC simulations agree
   well with those from a thermochemical computer code parametrized to
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of morbidity and mortality in sickle cell disease is caused
   by vaso-occlusion: circulatory obstruction leading to tissue ischemia
   and infarction. The consequences of vaso-occlusion are seen clinically
   throughout the vascular tree, from the relatively high-oxygen and
   high-velocity cerebral arteries to the relatively low-oxygen and
   low-velocity postcapillary venules. Prevailing models of vaso-occlusion
   propose mechanisms that are relevant only to regions of low oxygen and
   low velocity, leaving a wide gap in our understanding of the most
   important pathologic process in sickle cell disease. Progress toward
   understanding vaso-occlusion is further challenged by the complexity of
   the multiple processes thought to be involved, including, but not
   limited to 1) deoxygenation-dependent hemoglobin polymerization leading
   to impaired rheology, 2) endothelial and leukocyte activation, and 3)
   altered cellular adhesion. Here, we chose to focus exclusively on
   deoxygenation-dependent rheologic processes in an effort to quantify
   their contribution independent of the other processes that are likely
   involved in vivo. We take advantage of an experimental system that, to
   our knowledge, uniquely enables the study of pressure-driven blood flow
   in physiologic-sized tubes at physiologic hematocrit under controlled
   oxygenation conditions, while excluding the effects of endothelium,
   leukocyte activation, adhesion, inflammation, and coagulation. We find
   that deoxygenation-dependent rheologic processes are sufficient to
   increase apparent viscosity significantly, slowing blood flow velocity
   at arterial oxygen tension even without additional contributions from
   inflammation, adhesion, and endothelial and leukocyte activation. We
   quantify the changes in apparent viscosity and define a set of
   functional regimes of sickle cell blood flow personalized for each
   patient that may be important in further dissecting mechanisms of in
   vivo vaso-occlusion as well as in assessing risk of patient
   complications, response to transfusion, and the optimization of
   experimental therapies in development.}},

Abstract = {{The off-stoichiometric Heusler alloys, such as Ni50Mn25+yX25-y (X = Sn,
   In, Ga, etc.), have been extensively investigated using a variety of
   experimental techniques to probe their interesting and potentially
   useful magnetic properties. Recent Mn-55 nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) experiments, carried out largely in zero field (ZF) and making use
   of the large internal hyperfine field at the nuclear sites, have
   demonstrated the power of this approach in determining the ground state
   magnetic characteristics of these materials. In particular, the results
   reveal that distinct nanoscale ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic
   phases coexist. A key parameter used in interpreting the NMR data is the
   transverse relaxation time T-2 which, inter alia, determines the NMR
   blocking temperature T-B(NMR) of magnetic regions. The present
   experiments on a polycrystalline sample of a specific illustrative
   alloy, Ni43Co7Mn40Sn10, which has received considerable attention, show
   that the application of relatively small external fields, comparable to
   or greater than the local anisotropy field in the ferromagnetic cluster
   regions, produces dramatic changes in T-2 and hence T-B(NMR). The
   experimental findings are discussed using an extended version of a
   recently proposed nanocluster model for superparamagnetic systems. It is
   demonstrated that the field and temperature induced changes in T-2
   provide a significant test of the model and lead to a notable advance in
   applying the NMR technique to the investigation of the magnetic
   properties of this type of alloy. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{A regression model for calculating the second dimension retention index

   spectrometry}},

Abstract = {{Comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (GC x GC/TOF-MS) system has become a key analytical
   technology in high-throughput analysis. Retention index has been
   approved to be helpful for compound identification in one-dimensional
   gas chromatography, which is also true for two-dimensional gas
   chromatography. In this work, a novel regression model was proposed for
   calculating the second dimension retention index of target components
   where n-alkanes were used as reference compounds. This model was
   developed to depict the relationship among adjusted second dimension
   retention time, temperature of the second dimension column and carbon
   number of n-alkanes by an exponential nonlinear function with only five
   parameters. Three different criteria were introduced to find the optimal
   values of parameters. The performance of this model was evaluated using
   experimental data of n-alkanes (C-7-C-31) at 24 temperatures which can
   cover all 0-6s adjusted retention time area. The experimental results
   show that the mean relative error between predicted adjusted retention
   time and experimental data of n-alkanes was only 2\%. Furthermore, our
   proposed model demonstrates a good extrapolation capability for
   predicting adjusted retention time of target compounds which located out
   of the range of the reference compounds in the second dimension adjusted
   retention time space. Our work shows the deviation was less than 9
   retention index units (iu) while the number of alkanes were added up to
   5. The performance of our proposed model has also been demonstrated by
   analyzing a mixture of compounds in temperature programmed experiments.

Abstract = {{We report ab initio (LDA + U-sc) calculations of thermoelastic
   properties of ferric iron (Fe3+)- and aluminum (Al)-bearing bridgmanite
   (MgSiO3 perovskite), the main Earth forming phase, at relevant pressure
   and temperature conditions and compositions. Three coupled
   substitutions, namely, {[}Al](Mg)-{[}Al](Si), {[}Fe3+](Mg)-{[}Fe3+](Si),
   and {[}Fe3+](Mg)-{[}Al](Si) have been investigated. Aggregate elastic
   moduli and sound velocities are successfully compared with limited
   experimental data available. In the case of {[}Fe3+](Mg)-{[}Fe3+](Si)
   substitution, the high-spin (S = 5/2) to low-spin (S = 1/2) crossover in
   {[}Fe3+](Si) induces a volume collapse and elastic anomalies across the
   transition region. However, the associated anomalies should disappear in
   the presence of aluminum in the most favorable substitution, i.e.,
   {[}Fe3+](Mg)-{[}Al](Si). Calculated elastic properties along a lower
   mantle model geotherm suggest that the elastic behavior of bridgmanite
   with simultaneous substitution of Fe2O3 and Al2O3 in equal proportions
   or with Al2O3 in excess should be similar to that of (Mg,Fe2+)SiO3
   bridgmanite. However, excess of Fe2O3 should produce elastic anomalies
   in the crossover pressure region.}},

Abstract = {{Membrane-less organelles in cells are large, dynamic protein/protein or
   protein/RNA assemblies that have been reported in some cases to have
   liquid droplet properties. However, the molecular interactions
   underlying the recruitment of components are not well understood.
   Herein, we study how the ability to form higher-order assemblies
   influences the recruitment of the speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) to
   nuclear speckles. SPOP, a cullin-3-RING ubiquitin ligase (CRL3)
   substrate adaptor, self-associates into higher-order oligomers; that is,
   the number of monomers in an oligomer is broadly distributed and can be
   large. While wild-type SPOP localizes to liquid nuclear speckles,
   self-association-deficient SPOP mutants have a diffuse distribution in
   the nucleus. SPOP oligomerizes through its BTB and BACK domains. We show
   that BTB-mediated SPOP dimers form linear oligomers via BACK domain
   dimerization, and we determine the concentration-dependent populations
   of the resulting oligomeric species. Higher-order oligomerization of
   SPOP stimulates CRL3(SPOP) ubiquitination efficiency for its
   physiological substrate Gli3, suggesting that nuclear speckles are
   hotspots of ubiquitination. Dynamic, higher-order protein
   self-association may be a general mechanism to concentrate functional
   components in membrane-less cellular bodies.}},

Abstract = {{Although ionic liquids (ILs) have been used extensively in recent years
   as a high-capacitance ``dielectric{''} in electric double layer
   transistors, the dynamics of the double layer formation have remained
   relatively unexplored. Better understanding Of the dynamics and
   relaxation processes involved in electric double layer formation, will
   guide device optimization, particularly with regard to switching speed.
   In this paper, we explore the dynamical characteristics of an IL in a
   metal/ionic liquid/metal (M/IL/M) capacitor. In particular,. we examine
   a Au/IL/Au structure where the IL is l-butyl-l-methylpyrrolidinium
   tris(pentafluoroethyl)trifluorophosphate. The experiments consist of
   frequency-dependent impedance measurements and time-dependent current vs
   voltage measurements for applied linear voltage ramps and abrupt voltage
   steps. The parameters of an equivalent circuit model are determined by
   fits to the impedance vs frequency data and subsequently, verified by
   calculating the current vs voltage characteristics for the applied
   potential profiles. The data analysis indicates that the dynamics of the
   structure are characterized by a wide distribution of relaxation tithes
   spanning the range of less than microseconds to longer than seconds.
   Possible causes for these time scales are discussed.}},

   nm thick ZnO working electrodes prepared on SiO2/degenerately doped Si
   gates. We find that ultrathin ZnO behaves like a 2D semiconductor, in
   which charge carriers electrostatically induced by the back gate lead to
   band edge shift at the front electrode/electrolyte interface. This, in
   turn, manipulates the charge transfer kinetics on the electrode at a
   given electrode potential. Experimental results and the proposed model
   indicate that band edge alignment can be effectively modulated by
   0.1-0.4 eV depending on the density of states in the semiconductor and
   the capacitance of the gate/dielectric stack.}},

Abstract = {{We have utilized DC and AC transport measurements to measure the
   resistance and capacitance of thin films of conjugated
   oligophenyleneimine (OPI) molecules ranging from 1.5 to 7.5 nm in
   length. These films were synthesized on Au surfaces utilizing the imine
   condensation chemistry between terephthalaldehyde and
   1,4-benzenediamine. Near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS)
   spectroscopy yielded molecular tilt angles of 33-43 degrees. To probe DC
   and AC transport, we employed Au-S-OPI// GaOx/EGaIn junctions having
   contact areas of 9.6 X 10(2) mu m(2) (10(9) nm(2)) and compared to
   previously reported DC results on the same OPI system obtained using
   Au-S-OPI//Au conducting probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) junctions
   with 50 nm(2) areas. We found that intensive observables agreed very
   well across the two junction platforms. Specifically, the EGaIn-based
   junctions showed: (i) a crossover from tunneling to hopping transport at
   molecular lengths near 4 nm; (ii) activated transport for wires >4 nm in
   length with an activation energy of 0.245 +/- 0.008 eV for OPI-7; (iii)
   exponential dependence of conductance with molecular length with a decay
   constant beta = 2.84 +/- 0.18 nm(-1) (DC) and 2.92 +/- 0.13 nm(-1) (AC)
   in the tunneling regime, and an apparent beta = 1.01 +/- 0.08 nm(-1)
   (DC) and 0.99 0.11 nm(-1) (AC) in the hopping regime; (iv) previously
   unreported dielectric constant of 4.3 +/- 0.2 along the OPI wires.
   However, the absolute resistances of Au-S-OPI//GaOx/EGaIn junctions were
   approximately 100 times higher than the corresponding CP-AFM junctions
   due to differences in metal-inolecule contact resistances between the
   two platforms.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we first developed a modernized indentation technique for
   measuring tablet hardness. This technique is featured by rapid digital
   image capture, using a calibrated light microscope, and precise
   area-determination. We then systematically studied effects of key
   experimental parameters, including indentation force, speed, and holding
   time, on measured hardness of a very soft material, hydroxypropyl
   cellulose, and a very hard material, dibasic calcium phosphate, to cover
   a wide range of material properties. Based on the results, a holding
   period of 3 min at the peak indentation load is recommended to minimize
   the effect of testing speed on H. Using this method, we show that an
   exponential decay function well describes the relationship between
   tablet hardness and porosity for seven commonly used pharmaceutical
   powders investigated in this work. We propose that H and H at zero
   porosity may be used to quantify the tablet deformability and powder
   plasticity, respectively. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Volume = {{88-89}},

Abstract = {{The buckling and crushing mechanics of cellular honeycomb materials is
   an important engineering problem. Motivated by the pioneering
   experimental and numerical studies of Papka and Kyriakides (1994,
   1999a,b), we review the literature on finitely strained honeycombs
   subjected to in-plane loading and identify two open questions: (i) How
   does the mechanical response of the honeycomb depend on the applied
   loading device? and (ii) What can the Bloch wave representation of all
   bounded perturbations contribute to our understanding of the stability
   of post-bifurcated equilibrium configurations? To address these issues
   we model the honeycomb as a two-dimensional infinite perfect periodic
   medium. We use analytical group theory methods (as opposed to the more
   common, but less robust, imperfection method) to study the honeycomb's
   bifurcation behavior under three different far-field loadings that
   produce (initially) the same equi-biaxial contractive dilatation. Using
   an FEM discretization of the honeycomb walls (struts), we solve the
   equilibrium equations to find the principal and bifurcated equilibrium
   paths for each of the three loading cases. We evaluate the structure's
   stability using two criteria: rank-one convexity of the homogenized
   continuum (long wavelength perturbations) and Bloch wave stability
   (bounded perturbations of arbitrary wavelength). We find that the
   post-bifurcation behavior is extremely sensitive to the applied loading
   device, in spite of a common principal solution. We confirm that the
   flower mode is always unstable, as previously reported. However, our
   (first ever) Bloch wave stability analysis of the post-bifurcated
   equilibrium paths shows that the flower mode is stable for all
   sufficiently short wavelength perturbations. This new result provides a
   realistic explanation for why this mode has been observed in the finite
   size specimen experiments of Papka and Kyriakides (1999a). (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Aiming at solving large-scale optimization problems, this paper studies
   distributed optimization methods based on the alternating direction
   method of multipliers (ADMM). By formulating the optimization problem as
   a consensus problem, the ADMM can be used to solve the consensus problem
   in a fully parallel fashion over a computer network with a star
   topology. However, traditional synchronized computation does not scale
   well with the problem size, as the speed of the algorithm is limited by
   the slowest workers. This is particularly true in a heterogeneous
   network where the computing nodes experience different computation and
   communication delays. In this paper, we propose an asynchronous
   distributed ADMM (AD-ADMM), which can effectively improve the time
   efficiency of distributed optimization. Our main interest lies in
   analyzing the convergence conditions of the AD-ADMM, under the popular
   partially asynchronous model, which is defined based on a maximum
   tolerable delay of the network. Specifically, by considering general and
   possibly non-convex cost functions, we show that the AD-ADMM is
   guaranteed to converge to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points as
   long as the algorithm parameters are chosen appropriately according to
   the network delay. We further illustrate that the asynchrony of the ADMM
   has to be handled with care, as slightly modifying the implementation of
   the AD-ADMM can jeopardize the algorithm convergence, even under the
   standard convex setting.}},

Abstract = {{The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been
   recognized as a versatile approach for solving modern large-scale
   machine learning and signal processing problems efficiently. When the
   data size and/or the problem dimension is large, a distributed version
   of ADMM can be used, which is capable of distributing the computation
   load and the data set to a network of computing nodes. Unfortunately, a
   direct synchronous implementation of such algorithm does not scale well
   with the problem size, as the algorithm speed is limited by the slowest
   computing nodes. To address this issue, in a companion paper, we have
   proposed an asynchronous distributed ADMM (AD-ADMM) and studied its
   worst-case convergence conditions. In this paper, we further the study
   by characterizing the conditions under which the AD-ADMM achieves linear
   convergence. Our conditions as well as the resulting linear rates reveal
   the impact that various algorithm parameters, network delay, and network
   size have on the algorithm performance. To demonstrate the superior time

   solidification phase change and particle motion. A numerical solution
   approach is developed using the Galerkin finite element method and
   elliptic mesh generation in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian
   implementation, thus allowing for a rigorous representation of forces
   and dynamics previously inaccessible by approaches using analytical
   approximations. We demonstrate that this model accurately computes the
   solidification interface shape while simultaneously resolving thin fluid
   layers around the particle that arise from premelting during particle
   engulfment. We reinterpret the significance of premelting via the
   definition an unambiguous critical velocity for engulfment from
   steady-state analysis and bifurcation theory. We also explore the
   complicated transient behaviors that underlie the steady states of this
   system and posit the significance of dynamical behavior on engulfment
   events for many systems. We critically examine the onset of engulfment
   by comparing our computational predictions to those obtained using the
   analytical model of Rempel and Worster {[}29]. We assert that, while the
   accurate calculation of van der Waals repulsive forces remains an open
   issue, the computational model developed here provides a clear benefit
   over prior models for computing particle drag forces and other phenomena
   needed for the faithful simulation of particle engulfment. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional zeolite nanosheets that do not contain any organic
   structure-directing agents were prepared from a multilamellar MFI
   (ML-MFI) zeolite. ML-MFI was first exfoliated by melt compounding and
   then detemplated by treatment with a mixture of H2SO4 and H2O2 (piranha
   solution). The obtained OSDA-free MFI nanosheets disperse well in water
   and can be used for coating applications. Deposits made on porous
   polybenzimidazole (PBI) supports by simple filtration of these
   suspensions exhibit an n-butane/isobutane selectivity of 5.4, with an
   n-butane permeance of 3.5 x 10(-7) mol m(-2) s(-1) Pa-1 (ca. 1000 GPU).}},
