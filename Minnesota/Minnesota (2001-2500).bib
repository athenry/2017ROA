Abstract = {{Current regulations of SOx emissions require Sulfur Recovery Units
   (SRUs) to achieve recoveries in excess of 99.9\%. Capital cost of
   existing commercial Claus Tail gas clean up technologies capable of
   achieving that benchmark can amount to 45\% of the total capital cost of
   the SRU. Adsorption based processes hold significant potential for
   achieving the targeted recovery at lower costs considering their high
   selectivity towards removal of ppm level contaminants. This work
   assesses the economics of a Tail Gas Treatment Unit relying on a
   Temperature Swing Adsorption module for treating a typical industrial
   feed. An optimization problem is formulated and solved to determine the
   designs that minimize Net Present Worth (NPWC) of total capital
   investment,operating and bed replacement costs ensued during a 30 years
   project life. The total capital investment contribution of the optimized
   TGTU is around \$20 M comprising similar to 65\% of the NPWC value.
   Operating costs ranged between \$3.0 and \$3.6 per tonne of sulfur. Both
   figures compare favorably with commercial technologies. (C) 2014

Title = {{Single Ion Conducting, Polymerized Ionic Liquid Triblock Copolymer
   Films: High Capacitance Electrolyte Gates for n-type Transistors}},

Abstract = {{There has been impressive progress in the fabrication and
   characterization of p-type organic electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs).
   Unfortunately, despite the importance of n-type organic transistors for
   complementary circuits, fewer investigations have focused on developing
   electrolytes as gate dielectrics for n-type organic semiconductors.
   Here, we present a novel single ion conductor, a polymerized ionic
   liquid (PIL) triblock copolymer (PS-PIL-PS) composed of styrene (PS) and
   1-{[}(2-acryloyloxy)ethyl]-3-butylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (PIL), that conducts only the TFSI
   anion. This triblock copolymer acts as a gate dielectric to allow
   low-voltage n-type organic EGT operation. Impedance characterization of
   PS-PIL-PS reveals that there are three polarization regions: (1) dipolar
   relaxation, (2) ion migration, and (3) electric double layer (EDL)
   formation. These polarization regions are controlled by film thickness,
   and rapid EDL formation can be obtained in thinner polyelectrolyte
   films. In particular, a 500 nm-thick polyelectrolyte film exhibits a
   large capacitance of similar to 1 mu F/cm(2) at 10 kHz. Employing this
   single ion conducting PIL triblock copolymer as the gate insulator, we
   achieved low voltage operation (<1 V supply) of
   poly\{{[}N,N'-bis(2-octyldodecyl)-naphthalene-1,4,5,8-bis(dicarboximide)
   -2,6-diyl]-alt-5,5'-(2,2'-bithiophene)\} (P(NDI2OD-T2)) n-type organic
   EGTs (electron mobility of similar to 0.008 cm(2)/(V.s) and ON/OFF
   current ratio of similar to 2 x 10(3)) by preventing electrochemical
   doping. Furthermore, the recognition that the performance of n-type
   organic EGTs is diminished by 3D electrochemical doping suggests that it
   may be necessary to have a unipolar electrolyte to gate n-type organic
   semiconductors. Finally, we highlight that the use of PIL block
   copolymer electrolytes as gate insulators opens unique opportunities to
   explore the role of ion penetration in n-type organic EGTs by tuning the
   extent of electrochemical doping.}},

Abstract = {{The past two decades have witnessed the emergence and rapid growth of
   the research field of nanoscale thermal transport. Much of the work in
   this field has been fundamental studies that have explored the
   mechanisms of heat transport in nanoscale films, wires, particles,
   interfaces, and channels. However, in recent years there has been an
   increasing emphasis on utilizing the fundamental knowledge gained toward
   understanding and improving device and system performances. In this
   opinion article, an attempt is made to provide an evaluation of the
   existing and potential impacts of the basic research efforts in this
   field on the developments of the heat transfer discipline, workforce,
   and a number of technologies, including heat-assisted magnetic
   recording, phase change memories, thermal management of
   microelectronics, thermoelectric energy conversion, thermal energy
   storage, building and vehicle heating and cooling, manufacturing, and
   biomedical devices. The goal is to identify successful examples,

Abstract = {{The activities of solutes and solvents in solutions govern numerous
   physical phenomena in a wide range of practical applications. In prior
   work, we used statistical mechanics and multilayer adsorption isotherms
   to develop a transformative model for capturing thermodynamic properties
   of multicomponent aqueous solutions over the entire concentration range
   (Dutcher et al. J. Phys. Chem. 2011, 2012, 2013). That model needed only
   a few adsorption energy values to represent the solution thermodynamics
   of each solute. In the current work, we posit that the adsorption
   energies are due to dipole-dipole electrostatic forces in solute-solvent
   and solvent-solvent interactions. This hypothesis was tested in aqueous
   solutions on (a) 37 1:1 electrolytes, over a range of cation sizes, from
   H+ to tetrabutylammonium, for common anions including Cl-, Br-, I-,
   NO3-, OH-, ClO4-, and (b) 20 water-soluble organic molecules including
   alcohols and polyols. For both electrolytes and organic solutions, the
   energies of adsorption can be calculated with the dipole moments of the
   solvent, molecular size of the solvent and solute, and the
   solvent-solvent and solvent-solute intermolecular bond lengths. Many of
   these physical properties are available in the literature, with the
   exception of the solute-solvent intermolecular bond lengths. For those,
   predictive correlations developed here enable estimation of solute and
   solvent solution activities for which there are little or no activity
   data.}},

   liposomes. The competitive inhibition of alpha-CD with chromogenic PDA
   liposomes has already been used for sensing and detection purposes. Here
   we show that this mechanism can be successfully applied to characterize
   the reaction kinetics of alpha-CD with optically inactive compounds such
   as paraoxon neurotoxins via simple colorimetric changes. This method
   would enable easy characterisation of the interactions of alpha-CD when
   used as a drug delivery system or for drug solubilisation.

Abstract = {{Feasibility of heat assisted magnetic recording for granular and
   bit-patterned media (BPM) is evaluated in the context of various noises.
   Using micromagnetic simulation of renormalized media cells, we predict
   that the jitter is only 0.58 nm at a head speed of 10 m/s for the
   bilayer structure of FeRh/FePt when the grain size is 3.2 nm, validating
   the possibility of 6 Tb/in(2). We propose a new structure FePt/Cr/X/FePt
   that uses a Cr layer to produce an antiferromagnetic coupling that
   mimics the behavior of FeRh/FePt. We also confirmed the consistency of
   our renormalization approach for cell sizes from 1.0 to 1.5 nm. The
   temperature distribution is analyzed for BPM for areal densities of
   2.2-5 Tb/in(2). We have predicted the maximum tolerable on-track bit
   temperatures at different areal densities and filling factors and
   substantiate the feasibility of BPM at 5 Tb/in(2) by observing
   successful and deterministic switching under a realistic temperature
   distribution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel write precompensation scheme that adjusts
   the current magnitude, not the timing, to mitigate the serious 2-D
   nonlinear transition shift (NLTS) during the shingled writing process in
   a two-dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) system. This scheme
   calculates the needed optimum write field for the current transition
   being written by subtracting the demagnetizing field produced by the
   previous written bits from a fixed write field and determines the
   optimum writing current based on the minimum mean-squared-error
   criterion between the needed field and the available fields within an
   established field library. Such a write precompensation scheme is tested
   with a micromagnetic writer and exchange coupled composite media, and
   readback with a rotated reader array combined with a read channel.
   Simulation indicates that the proposed write precompensation technique
   can decrease bit error rate compared with the case without write
   precompensation and approach the performance of a system with negligible
   NLTS. Correspondingly, the maximum user areal density is increased from
   3.2 to 4.1 Tbits/in(2) for a TDMR system with 8 nm Voronoi grains due to
   the proposed write precompensation.}},

   take advantage of group sparsity structure. The L-1,L-2-norm
   regularization and the L-1,L-infinity-norm regularization are proposed
   to achieve the group sparse effect. Then the problem reduce to the
   multi-block optimization, which can be efficiently solved by the
   so-called Block Coordinate Decent (BCD) method. We also show that our
   approach can be used to solve the tensor low CP/Tucker rank completion
   problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our new method performs
   well numerically, especially when the tensor to be recovered indeed has

Abstract = {{Conversion to ammonia with Haber-Bosch catalysts can be increased above
   95\% by selective absorption of ammonia by MgCl2. The maximum conversion
   depends on reaction and absorption equilibria. At very short times, the
   measured conversion rate is the same with and without absorption by the
   MgCl2 salt; the overall rate constants are comparable to those in the
   literature. At larger times, conversion to ammonia can be over seven
   times greater with MgCl2 than without. However, the overall rate
   constants can be over 10 times slower because they are controlled by
   ammonia diffusion in the solid salt. An approximate, pseudosteady state
   theory consistent with these results provides a strategy for improving
   the overall rate while keeping the conversion over 90\%. For example,
   the absorption rates might be increased using smaller particles of
   absorbent on a porous inert absorbent support. The results provide part
   of the basis for designing small scale ammonia plants. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{The focus of this work is to evaluate a new carbon fiber reinforced
   composite structure with integrated sensing capabilities. In this
   composite structure, the typical matrix material used for carbon fiber
   reinforced composites is replaced with the thermoplastic polyvinylidene
   difluoride (PVDF). Since PVDF has piezoelectric properties, it enables
   the structure to be used for integrated load sensing. In addition, the
   electrical conductivity property of the carbon fabric is harnessed to
   form the electrodes of the integrated sensor. In order to prevent the
   carbon fiber electrodes from shorting to each other, a thin Kevlar
   fabric layer is placed between the two carbon fiber electrode layers as
   a dielectric. The optimal polarization parameters were determined using
   a design of experiments approach. Once polarized, the samples were then
   used in compression and tensile tests to determine the effective d(33)
   and d(31) piezoelectric coefficients. The degree of polarization of the
   PVDF material was determined by relating the effective d(33) coefficient
   of the composite to the achieved d(33) of the PVDF component of the
   composite using a closed form expression. Using this approach, it was
   shown that optimal polarization of the composite material results in a
   PVDF component d(33) of 3.2 pC N-1. Moreover, the Young's modulus of the
   composite structure has been characterized.}},

Abstract = {{In the fall of 2013, we offered an open online Introduction to
   Recommender Systems through Coursera, while simultaneously offering a
   for-credit version of the course on-campus using the Coursera platform
   and a flipped classroom instruction model. As the goal of offering this
   course was to experiment with this type of instruction, we performed
   extensive evaluation including surveys of demographics, self-assessed
   skills, and learning intent; we also designed a knowledge-assessment
   tool specifically for the subject matter in this course, administering
   it before and after the course to measure learning, and again 5 months
   later to measure retention. We also tracked students through the course,
   including separating out students enrolled for credit from those
   enrolled only for the free, open course.
   Students had significant knowledge gains across all levels of prior
   knowledge and across all demographic categories. The main predictor of
   knowledge gain was effort expended in the course. Students also had
   significant knowledge retention after the course. Both of these results
   are limited to the sample of students who chose to complete our
   knowledge tests. Student completion of the course was hard to predict,
   with few factors contributing predictive power; the main predictor of
   completion was intent to complete. Students who chose a concepts-only
   track with hand exercises achieved the same level of knowledge of
   recommender systems concepts as those who chose a programming track and
   its added assignments, though the programming students gained additional
   programming knowledge. Based on the limited data we were able to gather,
   face-to-face students performed as well as the online-only students or
   better; they preferred this format to traditional lecture for reasons
   ranging from pure convenience to the desire to watch videos at a
   different pace (slower for English language learners; faster for some
   native English speakers). This article also includes our qualitative
   observations, lessons learned, and future directions.}},

Abstract = {{Exciton transport in organic semiconductors is a critical, mediating
   process in many optoelectronic devices. Often, the diffusive and
   subdiffusive nature of excitons in these systems can limit device
   performance, motivating the development of strategies to direct exciton
   transport. In this work, directed exciton transport is achieved with the
   incorporation of exciton permeable interfaces. These interfaces
   introduce a symmetry-breaking imbalance in exciton energy transfer,
   leading to directed motion. Despite their obvious utility for enhanced
   exciton harvesting in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs), the emergent
   properties of these interfaces are as yet uncharacterized. Here,
   directed exciton transport is conclusively demonstrated in both dilute
   donor and energy-cascade OPVs where judicious optimization of the
   interface allows exciton transport to the donor acceptor heterojunction
   to occur considerably faster than when relying on simple diffusion.
   Generalized systems incorporating multiple exciton permeable interfaces
   are also explored, demonstrating the ability to further harness this
   phenomenon and expeditiously direct exciton motion, overcoming the
   diffusive limit.}},

Abstract = {{Enzymatic conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to fuel or chemicals is
   appealing, but is limited by lack of efficient technology for
   regeneration and reuse of expensive cofactors. Here we show that
   cationic polyelectrolyte-doped hollow nanofibers, which can be
   fabricated via a facile coaxial electrospinning technology, provide an
   ideal scaffold for assembly of cofactor and multienzymes capable of
   synthesizing methanol from CO2 through a cascade multistep reaction
   involving cofactor regeneration. Cofactor and four enzymes including
   formate, formaldehyde, alcohol, and glutamate dehydrogenases were in
   situ coencapsulated inside the lumen of hollow nanofibers by involving
   them in the core-phase solution for coaxial electrospinning, in which
   cationic polyelectrolyte was predissolved. The polyelectrolyte
   penetrating across the shell of the hollow nanofibers enabled efficient
   tethering and retention of cofactor inside the lumen via ion-exchange
   interactions between oppositely charged polyelectrolytes and cofactor.
   With carbonic anhydrase assembled on the outer surface of the hollow
   nanofibers for accelerating hydration Of CO2, these
   five-enzymes-cofactor catalyst system exhibited high activity for
   methanol synthesis. Compared with methanol yield of only 36.17\% using
   free enzymes and cofactor, the hollow nanofiber-supported system
   afforded a high value up to 103.2\%, the highest reported value so far.
   It was believed that the linear polyelectrolytes acted as spacers to
   enhance the shuttling of cofactor between enzymes that were
   coencapsulated within near vicinity, thus improving the efficiency of

Abstract = {{Background: Pre-clinical studies have shown that hypoxia preconditioning
   can enhance stem cell therapeutic potential for myocardial repair. We
   sought to investigate the safety and feasibility of intracoronary
   administration of hypoxia-preconditioned bone marrow mononuclear cells
   (HP-BMCs) for acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).
   Methods: We randomized 22 patients with acute STEMI to receive
   intracoronary administration of normoxia bone marrow mononuclear cells
   (N-BMCs) (n= 11) or HP-BMCs (n= 11) following successful reperfusion.
   Another 14 patients receiving standard therapy were recruited as control
   (n= 14).
   Results: There were no differences in the occurrence of major adverse
   cardiovascular events at 30 days and 1 year among three groups. There
   were significant improvement in the change of left ventricular
   end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and end-systolic volume (LVESV) inHP-BMC
   group both at 6 and 12 months compared with N-BMCs or control group (P <
   0.05). No differences were observed in the change of left ventricular
   ejection fraction (LVEF), or wall motion score index (WMSI) among three
   groups. Nevertheless, WMSI was improved in HP-BMCs and NBMC group (P <
   0.05, within group), but not in control. The ratio of myocardial
   perfusion defect determined by SPECT was significantly decreased in
   HP-BMCs and N-BMC groups at 6 months compared with baseline (P < 0.05,
   within group), but no significant differences were observed among three
   groups.
   Conclusions: Our results provide the first-in-man evidence that
   intracoronary administration of HP-BMCs following acute MI appears to be
   safe and feasible. These results provide the basis for future
   prospective randomized clinical trials in a larger patient cohort. (c)

Abstract = {{APOBEC3 (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like
   3) proteins are cellular DNA deaminases that restrict a broad spectrum
   of lentiviruses. This process is counteracted by Vif (viral infectivity
   factor) of lentiviruses, which binds APOBEC3s and promotes their
   degradation. CBF-beta (core binding factor subunit)3) is an essential
   co-factor for the function of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Vif to
   degrade human APOBEC3s. However, the requirement for CBF-beta in
   Vif-mediated degradation of other mammalian APOBEC3 proteins is less
   clear. Here, we determined the sequence of feline CBFB and performed
   phylogenetic analyses. These analyses revealed that mammalian CBFB is
   under purifying selection. Moreover, we demonstrated that CBF-beta is
   dispensable for feline immunodeficiency virus Vif-mediated degradation
   of APOBEC3s of its host. These findings suggested that primate
   lentiviruses have adapted to use CBF-beta, an evolutionary stable
   protein, to counteract APOBEC3 proteins of their hosts after diverging
   from other lentiviruses.}},

   for human exposure}},

Abstract = {{Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are
   emerging anthropogenic compounds that have recently become the target of
   global concern due to their ubiquitous presence in the environment,
   persistence, and bioaccumulative properties. This study was carried out
   to investigate the migration of PFOS and PFOA in soils and groundwater
   in a U.S. metropolitan area.
   We observed elevated levels in surface soils (median: 12.2 ng PFOS/g dw
   and 8.0 ng PFOA/g dw), which were much higher than the soil-screening
   levels for groundwater protection developed in this study. The measured
   levels in subsurface soils show a general increase with depth,
   suggesting a downward movement toward the groundwater table and a
   potential risk of aquifer contamination. Furthermore, concentrations of
   PFOS and PFOA in monitoring wells in the source zone varied
   insignificantly over 5 years (2009-2013), suggesting limited or no
   change in either the source or the magnitude of the source. The analysis
   also shows that natural processes of dispersion and dilution can
   significantly attenuate the groundwater contamination; the adsorption on
   aquifer solids, on the other hand, appears to have limited effects on
   the transport of PFOS and PFOA in the aquifer. The probabilistic
   exposure assessment indicates that ingestion of contaminated groundwater
   constitutes a much more important exposure route than ingestion of
   contaminated soil. Overall, the results suggest that (i) the transport
   of PFOS and PFOA is retarded in the vadose zone, but not in the aquifer;
   (ii) the groundwater contamination of PFOS and PFOA often follows their
   release to surface soils by years, if not decades; and (iii) the aquifer
   can be a major source of exposure for communities living near point
   sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The cochlear implant is considered one of the most successful neural
   prostheses to date, which was made possible by visionaries who continued
   to develop the cochlear implant through multiple technological and
   clinical challenges. However, patients without a functional auditory
   nerve or implantable cochlea cannot benefit from a cochlear implant. The
   focus of the paper is to review the development and translation of a new
   type of central auditory prosthesis for this group of patients that is
   known as the auditory midbrain implant (AMI) and is designed for
   electrical stimulation within the inferior colliculus. The rationale and
   results for the first AMI clinical study using a multi-site single-shank
   array will be presented initially. Although the AMI has achieved
   encouraging results in terms of safety and improvements in lip-reading
   capabilities and environmental awareness, it has not yet provided
   sufficient speech perception. Animal and human data will then be
   presented to show that a two-shank AMI array can potentially improve
   hearing performance by targeting specific neurons of the inferior
   colliculus. A new two-shank array, stimulation strategy, and surgical
   approach are planned for the AMI that are expected to improve hearing
   performance in the patients who will be implanted in an upcoming
   clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health. Positive
   outcomes from this clinical trial will motivate new efforts and
   developments toward improving central auditory prostheses for those who
   cannot sufficiently benefit from cochlear implants. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Heat transfer measurements for nucleate pool boiling of a dilute
   emulsion on a short vertical surface are reported. The vertical surface
   is a thin steel ribbon of 1.35mm height x 101mm length. Direct current
   resistance heating produces boiling either on the surface or in the free
   convection boundary layer of dilute emulsions of pentane in water and
   FC-72 in water. Single phase and boiling heat transfer is measured for
   emulsions with a volume fraction of the dispersed component of 0.1\% and
   0.5\% in a pool at approximately 25 degrees C. The dispersed component
   is created by a simple atomization process and no surfactants are
   employed to maintain the droplets of the dispersed phase in suspension.
   In free convection, the presence of the dispersed component somewhat
   impedes heat transfer, but when boiling commences enhancement of heat
   transfer is observed. Boiling is observed in the emulsions at lower
   surface temperatures than for water alone, and significantly more
   superheat is required to initiate boiling of the dispersed component
   than would be needed for a pool of the dispersed component alone.
   Consequently, a temperature over shoot is observed prior to initiation
   of boiling, and such an over shoot has been observed in several prior
   studies. Boiling heat fluxes are compared to recently published
   measurements of boiling in similar emulsions on a small diameter
   horizontal wire. Boiling generally occurs at a slightly higher degree of
   superheat of the dispersed component on the heated strip as compared to
   thin wires.}},

Abstract = {{Renewable production of p-xylene from {[}4 + 2] Diels-Alder
   cycloaddition of 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and ethylene with H - Y zeolite
   catalyst in n-heptane solvent is investigated. Experimental studies
   varying the solid acid catalyst concentration reveal two kinetic regimes
   for the p-xylene production rate: (i) a linear regime at low acid site
   concentrations with activation energy E-a = 10.8 kcal/mol and (ii) a
   catalyst-independent kinetic regime at high acid site concentrations
   with activation energy E-a = 20.1 kcal/mol. We carry out hybrid QM/MM
   calculations with a three-layer embedded cluster ONIOM model to compute
   the energetics along the main reaction pathway, and a microkinetic model
   is constructed for the interpretation of the experimental kinetic data.
   At high solid acid concentrations, p-xylene production is limited by the
   homogeneous Diels-Alder reaction, whereas at low acid concentrations,
   the overall rate is limited by the heterogeneously catalyzed dehydration
   of the Diels Alder cydoadduct of DMF and ethylene because of an
   insufficient number of acid sites, despite the dehydration reaction
   requiring significantly less activation energy. A reduced kinetic model
   reveals that the production of p-xylene follows the general kinetics of
   tandem reactions in which the first step is uncatalyzed and the second
   step is heterogeneously catalyzed. Reaction orders and apparent
   activation energies of quantum mechanical and microldnetic simulations
   are in agreement with experimental values.}},

Abstract = {{Underwater vehicles that travel inside a bubble or supercavity offer
   possibilities for high-speed and energy-efficient transportation of
   cargo and personnel. Validation and testing of mathematical models and
   control systems for these vehicles is a challenge due to the cost and
   complexity of experimental facilities and testing procedures. A
   cost-efficient and low-complexity approach to the experimental
   validation of mathematical models and control systems for a
   supercavitating test vehicle is presented in this paper. The proposed
   method enables the testing of control algorithms subject to steady and
   unsteady flows in a high-speed water tunnel. The method combines a
   real-time simulation of the vehicle dynamics, force measurements from an
   experimental scale vehicle, and flight control computer to reproduce the
   vehicle motion subject to realistic flow conditions and hardware
   constraints as actuator saturation and time delay. The model of the
   vehicle dynamics, used for the validation infrastructure and control
   design, is derived using experimental data. A controller designed to
   track pitch angle reference commands was tested on the experimental
   platform. The test cases validated the operation of the vehicle and
   controller subject to steady and unsteady flows.}},

   presented to show: (1) new changeability design structure matrix (CDSM)
   to express all planned system configurations, (2) cladistics analysis to
   hierarchically cluster CDSM into component modules, and (3) new

Abstract = {{An electric field built inside a crystal was proposed to enhance
   photoinduced carrier separation for improving photocatalytic property of
   semiconductor photocatalysts. However, a static built-in electric field
   can easily be saturated by the free carriers due to electrostatic
   screening, and the enhancement of photocatalysis, thus, is halted. To
   overcome this problem, here, we propose sonophotocatalysis based on a
   new hybrid photocatalyst, which combines ferroelectric nanocrystals
   (BaTiO3) and semiconductor nanoparticles (Ag2O) to form an Ag2O-BaTiO3
   hybrid photocatalyst. Under periodic ultrasonic excitation, a
   spontaneous polarization potential of BaTiO3 nanocrystals in responding
   to ultrasonic wave can act as alternating built-in electric field to
   separate photoinduced carriers incessantly, which can significantly
   enhance the photocatalytic activity and cyclic performance of the
   Ag2O-BaTiO3 hybrid structure. The piezoelectric effect combined with
   photoelectric conversion realizes an ultrasonic-wave-driven
   piezophototronic process in the hybrid photocatalyst, which is the
   fundamental of sonophotocatalysis.}},

Abstract = {{As the first section of a multi-part review series, this section
   provides an overview of the ongoing research and development aimed at
   fabricating novel heart valve replacements beyond what is currently
   available for patients. Here we discuss heart valve replacement options
   that involve a biological component or process for creation, either in
   vitro or in vivo (tissue-engineered heart valves), and heart valves that
   are fabricated from polymeric material that are considered permanent
   inert materials that may suffice for adults where growth is not
   required. Polymeric materials provide opportunities for cost-effective
   heart valves that can be more easily manufactured and can be easily
   integrated with artificial heart and ventricular assist device
   technologies. Tissue engineered heart valves show promise as a
   regenerative patient specific model that could be the future of all
   valve replacement. Because tissue-engineered heart valves depend on
   cells for their creation, understanding how cells sense and respond to
   chemical and physical stimuli in their microenvironment is critical and
   therefore, is also reviewed.}},

   new, increasingly efficacious and less invasive treatment options. As
   much as any other field in medicine the treatment of heart valve disease
   has experienced a renaissance in the last 10 years. Here we review the
   currently available technologies and future options in the surgical and
   transcatheter treatment of aortic valve disease. Different valves from
   major manufacturers are described in details with their applications.}},

Title = {{Pulse Timing During Irreversible Electroporation Achieves Enhanced
   Destruction in a Hindlimb Model of Cancer}},

Abstract = {{The use of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for cancer treatment has
   increased during the past decade due to many advantages over other focal
   therapies. However, despite early success in pre-clinical and clinical
   IRE trials, in vivo studies have shown that IRE suffers from an
   inability to destroy large volumes of cancer tissue without repeating
   treatment and/or increasing the applied electrical dose to dangerous
   levels. The present work demonstrates a simple method whereby treatment
   volumes can be enhanced by changing pulse timing (delivering pulsing in
   three trains, 30 s apart), without changing the electrical dose (51
   pulses at pulse strengths of 600 V, durations of 50 A mu s, and
   repetition rates of 10 Hz), during IRE in a 3D hindlimb tumor model.
   Results show that 3 weeks of tumor growth delay was achieved with pulse
   timing compared to 1 week in baseline IRE (200\% increase). Furthermore,
   the pulse timing approach does not introduce any foreign molecules into
   the body and can easily be integrated into existing treatment or
   enhancement protocols of IRE. The enhanced injury may correlate to
   longer pore exposures, or time during which pores exist on the membrane
   during pulse timing. This in turn increases the likelihood of membrane
   failure, and/or death from secondary injury such as loss of critical
   ions, proteins and other cellular components. In summary this work
   demonstrates a simple translational approach to increase 3D IRE
   treatment volumes in vivo by using pulse timing.}},

Abstract = {{Pelletized refuse-derived fuel (RDF; 65 wt \% nonrecyclable
   fibers/plastics) and integrated calcium hydroxide sorbent (35 wt \%),
   referred to as a ReEngineered Feedstock (ReEF), were evaluated as a
   renewable fuel and an in situ sulfur sorbent within pulverized coal
   combustion. Characterization of ReEF with scanning electron
   microscopy-energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy indicated random
   distribution of calcium hydroxide sorbents on fiber/plastic particles.
   The sulfation kinetics of ReEF combustion were evaluated in a drop-tube
   reactor at variable conditions (800-1000 degrees C, 1400 ppm of SO2, and
   5-30\% O-2 in N-2) with continuous effluent characterization via online
   IR spectroscopy. Sulfation of calcium hydroxide in ReEF was delayed
   because of RDF combustion when compared with pure calcium hydroxide
   sorbent. A low-O-2 condition was shown to produce high conversion of
   calcium hydroxide to calcium sulfate (X-Ca(OH)2 > 0.4), while
   calcination and combustion of ReEF in a high-O-2 environment (O-2 >
   20\%) resulted in increased sorbent sintering and reduced total sulfur

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The sensitivity of energy management strategies (EMS) with respect to
   variations in drive cycle and system parameters is considered. The
   design of three strategies is presented: rule-based, stochastic dynamic
   programming (SDP), and model predictive control (MPC). Each strategy is
   applied to a series hydraulic hybrid powertrain and validated
   experimentally using a hardware-in-the-loop system. A full factorial
   design of experiments (DOE) is conducted to evaluate the performance of
   these controllers under different urban and highway drive cycles as well
   as with enforced modeling errors. Through this study, it is observed
   that each EMS design method represents a different level of tradeoff
   between optimality and robustness based on how much knowledge of the
   system is assumed. This tradeoff is quantified by analyzing the standard
   deviation of system specific fuel consumption (SSFC) and root mean
   square (RMS) tracking error over the different simulation cases. This
   insight can then be used to motivate the choice of which control
   strategy to use based on the application. For example, a city bus
   travels a repeated route and that knowledge can be leveraged in the EMS
   design to improve performance. Through this study, it is demonstrated
   that there is not one EMS design method which is best suited for all
   applications but rather the underlying assumptions of the system and
   drive cycle must be carefully considered so that the most appropriate
   design method is chosen.}},

Abstract = {{Layered two-dimensional materials have demonstrated novel optoelectronic
   properties and are well suited for integration in planar photonic
   circuits. Graphene, for example, has been utilized for wideband
   photodetection. However, because graphene lacks a bandgap, graphene
   photodetectors suffer from very high dark current. In contrast, layered
   black phosphorous, the latest addition to the family of two-dimensional
   materials, is ideal for photodetector applications due to its narrow but
   finite bandgap. Here, we demonstrate a gated multilayer black phosphorus
   photodetector integrated on a silicon photonic waveguide operating in
   the near-infrared telecom band. In a significant advantage over graphene
   devices, black phosphorus photodetectors can operate under bias with
   very low dark current and attain an intrinsic responsivity up to 135
   mAW(-1) and 657 mAW(-1) in 11.5-nm- and 100-nm-thick devices,
   respectively, at room temperature. The photocurrent is dominated by the
   photovoltaic effect with a high response bandwidth exceeding 3 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Cofactor is especially important for biotransformation catalyzed by
   oxidoreductases. Many attempts in enhancing performance of the reactions
   by improving cofactor utilization have been reported. In this study,
   efficiency of cofactor-requiring biocatalysis was enhanced by improving
   cofactor recycling via spatially programmed assembling glycerol
   dehydrogenase (GlyDH, Escherichia coli MG1655) and glutamate
   dehydrogenase (GluDH, Bacillus subtilis str168), with the aid of
   single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). The two enzymes were first independently
   expressed as molecules fused with a phage protein A{*} that could
   covalently link ssDNA with certain features. After an enzymatic
   cross-linking reaction taking place under mild conditions, the conjugate
   of fused enzyme and ssDNA was assembled into desired structures through
   base pairing enabled by the ssDNA. Results showed that, to some extent,
   the fusion with protein A{*} could improve the specific activity of the
   enzymes (GlyDH-A{*}/GlyDH = 116.0 \%; GluDH-A{*}/GluDH = 105.2 \%).
   Additionally, in the coupled reaction system with glycerol and
   alpha-ketoglutaric acid as substrates, regarding the production of
   glutamic acid based on HPLC analysis, the efficiency of cofactor
   utilization was significantly enhanced (by 23.8- to 41.9-folds),
   indicating the existence of a substrate-channeling mechanism for
   cofactor utilization in the assembled reaction system due to the
   proximity effects. The degree of substrate channeling was calculated as
   from 1.65 to 1.73. Furthermore, the efficiency of cofactor utilization
   was influenced in an architecture-dependent manner when complexes with
   different stoichiometry of GlyDH and GluDH were utilized in
   biotransformation. This study demonstrated a novel strategy of cofactor
   recycling for enhanced performance of coupled oxidoreductive reactions.}},

Title = {{The use of micro-CT with image segmentation to quantify leakage in
   dental restorations}},
Journal = {{DENTAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{382-390}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To develop a method for quantifying leakage in composite
   resin restorations after curing, using non-destructive X-ray
   micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) and image segmentation.
   Methods. Class-I cavity preparations were made in 20 human third molars,
   which were divided into 2 groups. Group I was restored with Z100 and
   Group II with Filtek LS. Micro-CT scans were taken for both groups
   before and after they were submerged in silver nitrate solution
   (AgNO(3)50\%) to reveal any interfacial gap and leakage at the tooth
   restoration inter-face. Image segmentation was carried out by first
   performing image correlation to align the before and after-treatment
   images and then by image subtraction to isolate the silver nitrate
   penetrant for precise volume calculation. Two-tailed Student's t-test
   was used to analyze the results, with the level of significance set at p
   < 0.05.
   Results. All samples from Group I showed silver nitrate penetration with
   a mean volume of 1.3 +/- 0.7 mm(3). In Group II, only 2 out of the 10
   restorations displayed infiltration along the interface, giving a mean
   volume of 0.3 +/- 0.3 mm(3). The difference between the two groups was
   statistically significant (p < 0.05). The infiltration showed
   non-uniform patterns with in the interface.
   Significance. We have developed a method to quantify the volume of
   leakage using non-destructive micro-CT, silver nitrate infiltration and
   image segmentation. Our results confirmed that substantial leakage could
   occur in composite restorations that have imper-fections in the adhesive
   layer or interfacial debonding through polymerization shrinkage. For the
   restorative systems investigated in this study, this occurred mostly at
   the interface between the adhesive system and the tooth structure. (C)

Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Exposure to combustion byproducts from cooking is a major health concern
   globally. Alternative stoves may reduce the burden of disease associated
   with exposure to household air pollution. We subsidized Ugastove-brand
   rocket stoves to 54 households in six rural Ugandan villages. We
   monitored kitchen concentrations of fine particles (PM2.5) and carbon
   monoxide (CO) before and one month after introduction of the Ugastove.
   Temperature data-loggers were affixed to each Ugastove and to the
   traditional stove (three-stone fire) during the 1-month Ugastove
   acclimation period to record temporal patterns in stove use and
   adoption. Household surveys were administered to collect household
   information that may impact stove use or indoor air quality. PM2.5
   kitchen concentrations were 37\% lower after introduction of the
   Ugastove (mean reduction: 0.68 mg/m(3); 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]:
   0.2-12; p < 0.01). Changes in CO concentrations were small (8\% lower;
   mean reduction: 1.4 ppm, 95\% CI: -5.2-7.9) and not statistically
   significant. During the 1-month acclimation period, 47\% of households
   used primarily the Ugastove, 12\% used primarily the three stone fire,
   and 41\% used both stoves in tandem. PM2.5 concentrations were generally
   lowest in households that used primarily the Ugastove, followed by
   households that used stoves in tandem and that primarily used a
   three-stone fire. In summary, introduction of the Ugastove in 54 rural
   Ugandan households was associated with modest reductions in kitchen
   concentrations of PM2.5 but not CO. Objective measures of stove use
   reveal that short-term stove use varied by household. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The plasma protein C3 is a central element in the activation and
   effector functions of the complement system. A hereditary dysfunction of
   C3 that prevents complement activation via the alternative pathway (AP)
   was described previously in a Swedish family, but its genetic cause and
   molecular consequences have remained elusive. In this study, we provide
   these missing links by pinpointing the dysfunction to a point mutation
   in the beta-chain of C3 (c.1180T > C; p.Met(373)Thr). In the patient's
   plasma, AP activity was completely abolished and could only be
   reconstituted with the addition of normal C3. The M373T mutation was
   localized to the macroglobulin domain 4 of C3, which contains a binding
   site for the complement inhibitor compstatin and is considered critical
   for the interaction of C3 with the AP C3 convertase. Structural analyses
   suggested that the mutation disturbs the integrity of macroglobulin
   domain 4 and induces conformational changes that propagate into adjacent
   regions. Indeed, C3 M373T showed an altered binding pattern for
   compstatin and surface-bound C3b, and the presence of Thr(373) in either
   the C3 substrate or convertase-affiliated C3b impaired C3 activation and
   opsonization. In contrast to known gain-of-function mutations in C3,
   patients affected by this loss-of-function mutation did not develop
   familial disease, but rather showed diverse and mostly episodic
   symptoms. Our study therefore reveals the molecular mechanism of a
   relevant loss-of-function mutation in C3 and provides insight into the
   function of the C3 convertase, the differential involvement of C3
   activity in clinical conditions, and some potential implications of
   therapeutic complement inhibition.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Thermochemical processes developed for carbon capture and storage (CCS)
   offer high carbon capture capacities, but are generally hampered by low
   energy efficiency. Reversible cascade enzyme reactions are examined in
   this work for energy-efficient carbon sequestration. By integrating the
   reactions of two key enzymes of RTCA cycle, isocitrate dehydrogenase and
   aconitase, we demonstrate that intensified carbon capture can be
   realized through such cascade enzymatic reactions. Experiments show that
   enhanced thermodynamic driving force for carbon conversion can be

   reactions have the potential to capture 0.5 mol carbon at pH 6 for each
   mole of substrate applied. Overall it manifests that the carbon capture
   capacity of biocatalytic reactions, in addition to be energy efficient,

Abstract = {{Many machine learning applications involve analysis of high-dimensional
   data, where the number of input features is larger than/comparable to
   the number of data samples. Standard classification methods may not be
   sufficient for such data, and this provides motivation for nonstandard
   learning settings. One such new learning methodology is called learning
   through contradiction or Universum-support vector machine (U-SVM).
   Recent studies have shown U-SVM to be quite effective for sparse
   highdimensional data sets. However, all these earlier studies have used
   balanced data sets with equal misclassification costs. This paper
   extends the U-SVM formulation to problems with different
   misclassification costs, and presents practical conditions for the
   effectiveness of this cost-sensitive U-SVM. Several empirical
   comparisons are presented to validate the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{The electrical mobilities and scalar friction factors of modest-to-high

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{82}},
Pages = {{24-39}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we compared measured electrical mobilities of spherical
   and non-spherical nanoparticles to the predictions of both transition
   regime and free molecular theories. Mobility measurements were performed
   using a differential mobility analyzer (DMA) with both air and carbon
   dioxide as background gases, at atmospheric pressure and room
   temperature. For all measurements, DMA operational settings were
   selected in an attempt to minimize particle alignment with the electric
   field or flow direction, such that particles traversed the DMA rotating
   close to randomly. The particles included gold nanospheres (diameters of
   50 nm and 70 nm), polystyrene latex dimers (primary particle diameter of
   116 nm), gold nanorods (mobility equivalent diameters of 40-70 nm;
   aspect ratio 1.8-14) and carbon nanotubes (mobility equivalent diameters
   of 483 nm -603 nm; aspect ratios 95-243). Our primary objective was to
   test the accuracy of a transition regime theory (Dahneke's adjusted
   sphere model) for non-spherical particles; this theory suggests that
   electrical mobilities are dependent upon a particle Knudsen number,
   specifically defined as Kn=lambda pi R-H/PA, where lambda is the
   background gas mean free path, R-H is the particle's hydrodynamic
   radius, and PA is its projected area. For this test, electrical
   mobilities were calculated from the dimensions of particles collected
   downstream of a DMA and observed via TEM, with the DMA operated with
   fixed voltage and sheath flowrate. Mobility calculations for each
   particle were used to reconstruct electrical mobility histograms, which
   we show are directly comparable to the DMA transfer function for the
   operating conditions selected. We further compared the mean electrical
   mobilities of electrical mobility ranked sub-populations to the transfer
   function weighted mean mobilities of ``windows{''} smaller in width than
   the DMA transfer function. Through analysis we find that in the 0.7 < Kn
   < 6 range, measurements are explained well by the proposed transition
   regime expression (the adjusted sphere model), with transfer function
   weighted and sub-population mean electrical mobilities typically within
   10\% of one another. Electrical mobilities calculated using solely free
   molecular models were in reasonable agreement with observations (+/-
   20\%) for Kn > 3, but were systematically lower (by up to 50\%) than
   measurements for 1 < Kn < 3. Based upon the presented measurements and
   analysis, we propose that (1) an appropriate Knudsen number-dependent
   friction factor/electrical mobility expression needs to be used in
   interpreting DMA measurements not only for spheres (as is common
   practice), but also non-spherical nanorods and nanotubes, and (2) the
   expression tested here is suitable for such measurement interpretation.

Abstract = {{Background Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and whole-exome sequencing
   (WES) technologies are increasingly used to identify
   disease-contributing mutations in human genomic studies. It can be a
   significant challenge to process such data, especially when a large
   family or cohort is sequenced. Our objective was to develop a big data
   toolset to efficiently manipulate genome-wide variants, functional
   annotations and coverage, together with conducting family based
   sequencing data analysis.
   Methods Hadoop is a framework for reliable, scalable, distributed
   processing of large data sets using MapReduce programming models. Based
   on Hadoop and HBase, we developed SeqHBase, a big data-based toolset for
   analysing family based sequencing data to detect de novo, inherited
   homozygous, or compound heterozygous mutations that may contribute to
   disease manifestations. SeqHBase takes as input BAM files (for coverage
   at every site), variant call format (VCF) files (for variant calls) and
   functional annotations (for variant prioritisation).
   Results We applied SeqHBase to a 5-member nuclear family and a 10-member
   3-generation family with WGS data, as well as a 4-member nuclear family
   with WES data. Analysis times were almost linearly scalable with number
   of data nodes. With 20 data nodes, SeqHBase took about 5 secs to analyse
   WES familial data and approximately 1 min to analyse WGS familial data.
   Conclusions These results demonstrate SeqHBase's high efficiency and
   scalability, which is necessary as WGS and WES are rapidly becoming
   standard methods to study the genetics of familial disorders.}},

Title = {{Pairing broadband noise with cortical stimulation induces extensive
   suppression of ascending sensory activity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The corticofugal system can alter coding along the ascending
   sensory pathway. Within the auditory system, electrical stimulation of
   the auditory cortex (AC) paired with a pure tone can cause egocentric
   shifts in the tuning of auditory neurons, making them more sensitive to
   the pure tone frequency. Since tinnitus has been linked with
   hyperactivity across auditory neurons, we sought to develop a new
   neuromodulation approach that could suppress a wide range of neurons
   rather than enhance specific frequency-tuned neurons. Approach. We
   performed experiments in the guinea pig to assess the effects of
   cortical stimulation paired with broadband noise (PN-Stim) on ascending
   auditory activity within the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
   (CNIC), a widely studied region for AC stimulation paradigms. Main
   results. All eight stimulated AC subregions induced extensive
   suppression of activity across the CNIC that was not possible with noise
   stimulation alone. This suppression built up over time and remained
   after the PN-Stim paradigm. Significance. We propose that the
   corticofugal system is designed to decrease the brain's input gain to
   irrelevant stimuli and PN-Stim is able to artificially amplify this
   effect to suppress neural firing across the auditory system. The PN-Stim
   concept may have potential for treating tinnitus and other neurological
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{The minimum concave cost network flow problem (MCCNFP) is NP-hard, but
   efficient polynomial-time algorithms exist for some special cases such
   as the uncapacitated lot-sizing problem and many of its variants. We
   study the MCCNFP over a grid network with a general nonnegative
   separable concave cost function. We show that this problem is
   polynomially solvable when all sources are in the first echelon and all
   sinks are in two echelons, and when there is a single source but many
   sinks in multiple echelons. The polynomiality argument relies on a
   combination of a particular dynamic programming formulation and an
   investigation of the extreme points of the underlying flow polyhedron.
   We derive an analytical formula for the inflow into any node in an
   extreme point solution, which generalizes a result of Zangwill (Manag

   or ellipsoidal shapes. Since the plasmonic enhancement of molecular
   fluorescence is dependent on various parameters such as shape, size, and
   distribution of nearby nanoparticles, it is crucial to have more
   powerful analysis tools to be able to handle any arbitrary
   nanoparticles. For this purpose, the 3D finite element method, which is
   a commonly used technique for arbitrary structures, is implemented and
   reported in this paper. The emitting molecule is assumed to be an
   electric dipole point source. The fluorescence enhancement factor is
   described in term of a local electric field-enhancement factor and the
   quantum yield of the system. The model is validated by comparison to the
   approximate quasistatic model and the exact Mie theory. It provides more
   accurate results than those of the quasistatic model, which makes it
   become the powerful numerical approach for investigation of arbitrary
   nanostructure influence on molecular fluorescence. It is then applied
   for investigating the emission characteristics of the fluorescent
   molecule when it is placed in the vicinity of more complicated
   structures including dimers and chains of coupled nanoparticles. It is
   found that these coupled nanoparticle configurations provide stronger
   fluorescence enhancement than the single nanoparticle of the same
   particle size when the inter-particle gap is small. It is attributed to
   the higher electric-field enhancement in the inter-particle gap region
   via strong surface plasmon coupling effects of two neighboring
   nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{A horizontal axis wind turbine model was tested in a closed-circuit wind
   tunnel under various inflow conditions. Separate experiments placed the
   test turbine (i) in the wake of a three-dimensional, sinusoidal hill,
   (ii) in the wake of another turbine and (iii) in the turbulent boundary
   layer, as a reference case. Simultaneous high-frequency measurements of
   the turbine output voltage, rotor angular velocity along with streamwise
   and wall normal velocity components were collected at various locations
   through the turbine's miniature direct-current (DC) generator, a
   high-resolution laser tachometer and cross-wire anemometer,
   respectively. Validation trials were conducted first in order to
   characterize the test turbine's output and response to the baseline
   turbulent boundary layer. Analysis was performed by comparing the
   cross-wire anemometry measurements of the incoming flow with the turbine
   voltage output to investigate the unsteady rotor kinematics under
   different flow perturbations. Using spectral, auto-correlation and
   cross-correlation methods, it was found that the flow structures
   developing downwind of the hill leave a stronger signature on the
   fluctuations and spectrum of the rotor angular velocity, as compared
   with those flow structures filtered or deflected by placing a turbine
   upwind. In summary, we show that the effects on downwind turbines of
   complex terrain and multi-turbine arrangements are consistent with the
   induced modifications by the hill or turbine on the large scale
   structures in the incoming flow. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{In geomechanics and civil engineering, the distinct element method (DEM)
   is employed in a top-down manner to simulate problems involving

   crystalline nanograins as mesoscopic distinct elements. The elasticity,

   captured with contact models of interaction between elements.
   Simulations that rely on the fitting of the peak stress, strain, and

   mesoscopic DEM for bridging the atomistic-scale simulations with

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOLAR ENERGY ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Solar hot water and space heating systems constructed of commodity
   polymers have the potential to reduce the initial cost of solar thermal
   systems. However, a polymer absorber must be prevented from exceeding
   its maximum service temperature during stagnation. Here, the addition of
   a thermotropic material to the surface of the absorber is considered.
   The thermotropic layer provides passive overheat protection by switching
   from high transmittance during normal operation to high reflectance if
   the temperature of the absorber becomes too high. A one dimensional
   model of a glazed, flat-plate collector with a polymer absorber and
   thermotropic material is used to determine the effects of the optical
   properties of the thermotropic material on the optical efficiency and
   the stagnation temperature of a collector. A key result is
   identification of the reflectance in the translucent state required to
   provide overheat protection for potential polymer absorber materials.
   For example, a thermotropic material in its translucent state should
   have a solar-weighted reflectance greater than or equal to 52\% to
   protect a polypropylene absorber which has a maximum service temperature
   of 115 degrees C.}},

Title = {{Dynamic changes in short- and long-term bacterial composition following
   fecal microbiota transplantation for recurrent Clostridium difficile
   infection}},
Journal = {{MICROBIOME}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is an effective
   treatment for recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) that often
   fails standard antibiotic therapy. Despite its widespread recent use,
   however, little is known about the stability of the fecal microbiota
   following FMT.
   Results: Here we report on short- and long-term changes and provide
   kinetic visualization of fecal microbiota composition in patients with
   multiply recurrent CDI that were refractory to antibiotic therapy and
   treated using FMT. Fecal samples were collected from four patients
   before and up to 151 days after FMT, with daily collections until 28
   days and weekly collections until 84 days post-FMT. The composition of
   fecal bacteria was characterized using high throughput 16S rRNA gene
   sequence analysis, compared to microbiota across body sites in the Human
   Microbiome Project (HMP) database, and visualized in a movie-like,
   kinetic format. FMT resulted in rapid normalization of bacterial fecal
   sample composition from a markedly dysbiotic state to one representative
   of normal fecal microbiota. While the microbiome appeared most similar
   to the donor implant material 1 day post-FMT, the composition diverged
   variably at later time points. The donor microbiota composition also
   varied over time. However, both post-FMT and donor samples remained
   within the larger cloud of fecal microbiota characterized as healthy by
   the HMP.
   Conclusions: Dynamic behavior is an intrinsic property of normal fecal
   microbiota and should be accounted for in comparing microbial
   communities among normal individuals and those with disease states. This
   also suggests that more frequent sample analyses are needed in order to
   properly assess success of FMT procedures.}},

Abstract = {{The DRAINMOD simulation model was used to investigate combinations of
   drain depth and spacing for major soils of southern Minnesota to
   maximize profitability and minimize drained volume and surface runoff.
   Six soil types (Canisteo, Harps, Nicollet, Normania, Okoboji, and
   Webster) and three locations (Lamberton, Waseca, and Willmar) were
   included in the original study and one soil-location combination was
   reported on, herein (Webster-Waseca). Four drain depths (90, 105, 120,
   and 135 cm) were used and drain spacings were selected to simulate
   drainage coefficients from 3.2 to 19 mm/day. Soil input files for
   DRAINMOD were created using a combination of measured data from field
   sampling (soil texture and bulk density), data estimated with the
   Rosetta soil parameter model/van Genuchten equation (water retention
   curves), and publicly available data (soil permeability). Long-term
   simulations were conducted for each location using 90 years of
   historical climate data (1915-2005). Outputs from DRAINMOD were used to
   create ``performance{''} indices that enable the concurrent
   consideration of profitability, drainage volumes, and surface runoff,
   when choosing drain depth and spacing. A spreadsheet design tool was
   developed to compute and display these indices, based on a few simple
   user inputs to define cost and crop price. Internal rate of return was
   used as the basis for profitability considerations. Results obtained
   indicated that in general, profitability may be increased with increased
   drain depth and spacing, due to system costs associated with narrower
   drain spacings. It was found that when considering both profitability
   and drainage volume, deeper, more widely spaced drainage systems were
   generally preferable, because of increased profitability and decreased
   drainage volumes.}},

Abstract = {{Spin-orbit torques are studied in Ta/TbFeCo/MgO patterned structures,

   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (bulk-PMA) independent of the

   investigated in the presence of a perpendicular, longitudinal, or

   in the presence of a transverse field unique to our bulk-PMA material.
   It is found that the anti-damping torque related with spin Hall effect
   is very strong, and a spin Hall angle is determined to be 0.12. The
   field-like torque related with Rashba effect is unobservable, suggesting

Title = {{SSVEP signatures of binocular rivalry during simultaneous EEG and fMRI}},

Abstract = {{Background: Binocular rivalry is a perceptual phenomenon that arises
   when two incompatible images are presented separately, one to each eye,
   and the observer experiences involuntary perceptual alternations between
   the two images. If the two images are flickering at two distinct
   frequencies, electroencephalography (EEG) can be used to track the
   frequency-tagged steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) driven
   by each image as they compete for awareness, providing an objective
   measure of the subjective perceptual state. This spontaneous alternation
   in perceptual dominance is believed to be driven by neural processes
   across widespread regions in the brain, but the real-time mechanisms of
   these processes remain unclear.
   New Method: The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of
   investigating binocular rivalry using a simultaneous EEG-fMRI approach
   in order to leverage the high temporal resolution of EEG with the high
   spatial resolution of fMRI.
   Results: We have developed novel techniques for artifact removal and
   signal optimization for the rivalry-related SSVEP data collected
   simultaneously during fMRI.
   Comparison with Existing Methods: Our methods address several
   significant technical challenges of recording SSVEP data in the noisy
   fMRI environment, and enabled us to successfully reconstruct SSVEP
   signatures of rivalry in a group of healthy human subjects.
   Conclusion: Further development and application of these techniques will
   enable more comprehensive integration of EEG and fMRI data collected
   simultaneously and could have significant implications for EEG-fMRI
   studies of brain activity in general. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All right

Abstract = {{We present local density approximation augmented by the Hubbard-type
   correction calculations of high-temperature elastic properties of
   bridgmanite with composition (Mg(1-x)Fex2+)SiO3 for 0 <= x <= 0.125.
   Results of elastic moduli and acoustic velocities for the Mg end-member
   (x=0) agree very well with the latest high-pressure and high-temperature
   experimental measurements. In the iron-bearing system, we focus
   particularly on the change in thermoelastic parameters across the state
   change that occurs in ferrous iron above similar to 30GPa, often
   attributed to a high-spin (HS) to intermediate-spin (IS) crossover but
   explained by first-principles calculations as a lateral displacement of
   substitutional iron in the perovskite cage. We show that the measured
   effect of this change on the equation of state of this system can be
   explained by the lateral displacement of substitutional iron and not by
   the HS to IS crossover. The calculated elastic properties of
   (Mg0.875Fe0.1252+)SiO3 along an adiabatic mantle geotherm somewhat
   overestimate longitudinal velocities but produce densities and shear
   velocities quite consistent with the Preliminary Reference Earth Model
   data throughout most of the lower mantle.}},

   density was observed in the presence of RGD-nanowires, compared to an
   increase of only 15.6\% with PEG-nanowires. These results promise to

Title = {{Signature Wood Modifications Reveal Decomposer Community History}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 26}},
Abstract = {{Correlating plant litter decay rates with initial tissue traits (e.g. C,
   N contents) is common practice, but in woody litter, predictive
   relationships are often weak. Variability in predicting wood
   decomposition is partially due to territorial competition among fungal
   decomposers that, in turn, have a range of nutritional strategies (rot
   types) and consequences on residues. Given this biotic influence,
   researchers are increasingly using culture-independent tools in an
   attempt to link variability more directly to decomposer groups. Our goal
   was to complement these tools by using certain wood modifications as
   `signatures' that provide more functional information about decomposer
   dominance than density loss. Specifically, we used dilute alkali
   solubility (DAS; higher for brown rot) and lignin: density loss (L:D;
   higher for white rot) to infer rot type (binary) and fungal nutritional
   mode (gradient), respectively. We first determined strength of pattern
   among 29 fungi of known rot type by correlating DAS and L: D with mass
   loss in birch and pine. Having shown robust relationships for both
   techniques above a density loss threshold, we then demonstrated and
   resolved two issues relevant to species consortia and field trials, 1)
   spatial patchiness creating gravimetric bias (density bias), and 2)
   brown rot imprints prior or subsequent to white rot replacement (legacy
   effects). Finally, we field-tested our methods in a New Zealand Pinus
   radiata plantation in a paired-plot comparison. Overall, results
   validate these low-cost techniques that measure the collective histories
   of decomposer dominance in wood. The L: D measure also showed clear
   potential in classifying `rot type' along a spectrum rather than as a
   traditional binary type (brown versus white rot), as it places the
   nutritional strategies of wood-degrading fungi on a scale (L:D=0-5, in
   this case). These information-rich measures of consequence can provide
   insight into their biological causes, strengthening the links between
   traits, structure, and function during wood decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their outstanding electrical and mechanical properties,
   graphene strain sensors have attracted extensive attention for
   electronic applications in virtual reality, robotics, medical
   diagnostics, and healthcare. Although several strain sensors based on
   graphene have been reported, the stretchability and sensitivity of these
   sensors remain limited, and also there is a pressing need to develop a
   practical fabrication process. This paper reports the fabrication and
   characterization of new types of graphene strain sensors based on
   stretchable yarns. Highly stretchable, sensitive, and wearable sensors
   are realized by a layer-by-layer assembly method that is simple,
   low-cost, scalable, and solution-processable. Because of the yarn
   structures, these sensors exhibit high stretchability (up to 150\%) and
   versatility, and can detect both large- and small-scale human motions.
   For this study, wearable electronics are fabricated with implanted
   sensors that can monitor diverse human motions, including joint
   movement, phonation, swallowing, and breathing.}},

   conditions, the same cell line and medium, cells continue to produce
   lactate. A metabolic shift to lactate consumption has been correlated to
   the productivity of the process. Cultures that exhibited the metabolic
   shift to lactate consumption had higher titers than those which didn't.
   However, the cues that trigger the metabolic shift to lactate
   consumption state (or low lactate production state) are yet to be
   identified. Metabolic control of cells is tightly linked to growth
   control through signaling pathways such as the AKT pathway. We have
   previously shown that the glycolysis of proliferating cells can exhibit
   bistability with well-segregated high flux and low flux states. Low
   lactate production (or lactate consumption) is possible only at a low
   glycolysis flux state. In this study, we use mathematical modeling to
   demonstrate that lactate inhibition together with AKT regulation on
   glycolysis enzymes can profoundly influence the bistable behavior,
   resulting in a complex steady-state topology. The transition from the
   high flux state to the low flux state can only occur in certain regions
   of the steady state topology, and therefore the metabolic fate of the
   cells depends on their metabolic trajectory encountering the region that
   allows such a metabolic state switch. Insights from such switch behavior
   present us with new means to control the metabolism of mammalian cells
   in fed-batch cultures.}},

Title = {{Investigating a new neuromodulation treatment for brain disorders using
   synchronized activation of multimodal pathways}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 25}},
Abstract = {{Neuromodulation is an increasingly accepted treatment for neurological
   and psychiatric disorders but is limited by its invasiveness or its
   inability to target deep brain structures using noninvasive techniques.
   We propose a new concept called Multimodal Synchronization Therapy
   (mSync) for achieving targeted activation of the brain via noninvasive
   and precisely timed activation of auditory, visual, somatosensory,
   motor, cognitive, and limbic pathways. In this initial study in guinea
   pigs, we investigated mSync using combined activation of just the
   auditory and somatosensory pathways, which induced differential and
   timing dependent plasticity in neural firing within deep brain and
   cortical regions of the auditory system. Furthermore, by varying the
   location of somatosensory stimulation across the body, we increased or
   decreased spiking activity across different neurons. These encouraging
   results demonstrate the feasibility of systematically modulating the
   brain using mSync. Considering that hearing disorders such as tinnitus
   and hyperacusis have been linked to abnormal and hyperactive firing
   patterns within the auditory system, these results open up the
   possibility for using mSync to decrease this pathological activity by
   varying stimulation parameters. Incorporating multiple types of pathways
   beyond just auditory and somatosensory inputs and using other activation
   patterns may enable treatment of various brain disorders.}},

Abstract = {{A rise in resistance to current antifungals necessitates strategies to
   identify alternative sources of effective fungicides. We report the
   discovery of poacic acid, a potent antifungal compound found in
   lignocellulosic hydrolysates of grasses. Chemical genomics using
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae showed that loss of cell wall synthesis and
   maintenance genes conferred increased sensitivity to poacic acid.
   Morphological analysis revealed that cells treated with poacic acid
   behaved similarly to cells treated with other cell wall-targeting drugs
   and mutants with deletions in genes involved in processes related to
   cell wall biogenesis. Poacic acid causes rapid cell lysis and is
   synergistic with caspofungin and fluconazole. The cellular target was
   identified; poacic acid localized to the cell wall and inhibited
   beta-1,3-glucan synthesis in vivo and in vitro, apparently by directly
   binding beta-1,3-glucan. Through its activity on the glucan layer,
   poacic acid inhibits growth of the fungi Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and
   Alternaria solani aswell as the oomycete Phytophthora sojae. A single
   application of poacic acid to leaves infected with the broadrange fungal
   pathogen S. sclerotiorum substantially reduced lesion development. The
   discovery of poacic acid as a natural antifungal agent targeting
   beta-1,3-glucan highlights the potential side use of products generated
   in the processing of renewable biomass toward biofuels as a source of
   valuable bioactive compounds and further clarifies the nature and
   mechanism of fermentation inhibitors found in lignocellulosic
   hydrolysates.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 18}},
Abstract = {{Langmuir probe measurements in dusty plasmas is a challenge because
   particle and film deposition on the probe leads to contamination and
   distortion of the current-voltage characteristics. This problem is
   particularly acute while determining the electron energy probability
   function (EEPF) from the second derivative of the Langmuir probe
   current-voltage characteristics. Here, we present reliable EEPF
   measurements in a capacitively coupled argon-silane dusty plasma using a
   fast-scanning and shielded Langmuir probe. A solenoid-actuated shield
   covered the probe and the probe was exposed to the plasma only for short
   periods of time (less than 6 s) when the current-voltage characteristics
   were recorded during rapid voltage scans. This approach minimized probe
   surface contamination. In presence of dust (silicon nanoparticles) the
   electron density decreased and the electron temperature increased in
   comparison to a pristine argon plasma. While the population of lower
   energy electrons decreased in presence of dust, the high energy tail
   region overlapped throughout the experiment. Langmuir probe measurements
   were complemented with ion density measurements using a capacitive probe
   and ex situ examination of particles using electron microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{Nucleation of particles with sulfuric acid, water, and nitrogeneous
   bases was studied in a flow reactor. Sulfuric acid and water levels were
   set by flows over sulfuric acid and water reservoirs, respectively, and
   the base concentrations were determined from measured permeation rates
   and flow dilution ratios. Particle number distributions were measured
   with a nano-differential-mobility-analyzer system. Results indicate that
   the nucleation capability of NH3, methylamine, dimethylamine, and
   trimethylamine with sulfuric acid increases from NH3 as the weakest,
   methylamine next, and dimethylamine and trimethylamine the strongest.
   Three other bases were studied, and experiments with triethylamine
   showed that it is less effective than methylamine, and experiments with
   urea and acetamide showed that their capabilities are much lower than
   the amines with acetamide having basically no effect. When both NH3 and
   an amine were present, nucleation was more strongly enhanced than with
   just the amine present. Comparisons of nucleation rates to predictions
   and previous experimental work are discussed, and the sulfuric acid-base
   nucleation rates measured here are extrapolated to atmospheric
   conditions. The measurements suggest that atmospheric nucleation rates
   are significantly affected by synergistic interactions between ammonia
   and amines.}},

Abstract = {{Hole mobilities (mu) in rubrene single crystals (space group Cmca) along
   the crystallographic c-axis have been investigated as a function of
   temperature and applied electric field by the time-of-fight method.
   Measurements demonstrate an inverse power law dependence on temperature,
   namely, mu = mu T-0(-n) with n = 1.8, from room temperature down to 180
   K. At 296 K, the average value of mu was found to be 0.29 cm(2)/Vs
   increasing to an average value of 0.70 cm(2)/Vs at 180 K. Below 180K a
   decrease in mobility is observed with further cooling. Overall, these
   results confirm the anisotropic nature of transport in rubrene crystals
   as well as the generality of the inverse power law temperature
   dependence that is observed for field effect mobility measurements in
   the a-b crystal plane. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   into the cavity, allowing the combined resonator to operate at an
   efficient low-loss state. We show that the origin of this self-phasing
   stems from a redistribution of power between the two lasers. The
   resulting difference in circulating intensity produces a differential
   change in saturated gain, which in turn produces a differential
   Kramers-Kronig phase shift that effectively cancels the applied phase
   error. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Running-in behavior of internally plasma-treated silicone tubing}},
Journal = {{WEAR}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{326}},
Pages = {{44-47}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{When employed in biomedical applications, the bore of silicone tubing
   must be modified to become highly lubricious, for example, by means of
   plasma treatment. In this context, the determination of the degree of
   lubricity is normally accomplished with the aid of a frictional
   tribopartner. In practice, this determination is made uncertain and
   overly lengthy due to running-in behavior. The focus of this
   investigation is to characterize the running-in behavior, diagnose the
   factors that contribute to its existence, and develop means by which to
   eliminate the running-in process. The tribological system that was
   studied may be categorized as polymer/metal frictional interaction. It
   was discovered by systematic experimentation that transfer of material,
   rather than traditional wear, is at the root of the encountered
   running-in phenomena. These investigations included frictional-based and
   chemical-detection methodologies. Once the fundamental cause of the
   running-in behavior had been discovered and confirmed, a method for
   eliminating running-in was proposed and experimentally validated. (C)

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1391-1403}},
Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Wideband power spectrum sensing is essential for cognitive radio and
   many other applications. Aiming to crowdsource spectrum sensing
   operations, a novel frugal sensing framework was recently proposed,
   employing a network of low duty-cycle sensors (e.g., running in
   background mode on consumer devices) reporting randomly filtered
   broadband power measurement bits to a fusion center, which in turn
   estimates the ambient power spectrum. Frugal sensing is revisited here
   from a statistical estimation point of view. Taking into account fading
   and insufficient sample averaging considerations, maximum likelihood
   (ML) formulations are developed which outperform the original minimum
   power and interior point solutions when the soft power estimates prior
   to thresholding are noisy. Assuming availability of a downlink channel
   that the fusion center can use to send threshold information, active
   sensing strategies are developed that quickly narrow down and track the
   power spectrum estimate, using ideas borrowed from cutting plane methods
   to develop active ML solutions. Simulations show that satisfactory
   wideband power spectrum estimates can be obtained with passive ML
   sensing from few bits, and much better performance can be attained using
   active sensing. Various other aspects, such as known emitter spectral
   shapes and different types of non-negativity constraints, are also
   considered.}},

   Identification}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAR 13}},
Abstract = {{It is challenging to cluster cancer patients of a certain
   histopathological type into molecular subtypes of clinical importance
   and identify gene signatures directly relevant to the subtypes. Current
   clustering approaches have inherent limitations, which prevent them from
   gauging the subtle heterogeneity of the molecular subtypes. In this
   paper we present a new framework: SPARCoC (Sparse-CoClust), which is
   based on a novel Common-background and Sparse-foreground Decomposition
   (CSD) model and the Maximum Block Improvement (MBI) co-clustering
   technique. SPARCoC has clear advantages compared with widely-used
   alternative approaches: hierarchical clustering (Hclust) and nonnegative
   matrix factorization (NMF). We apply SPARCoC to the study of lung
   adenocarcinoma (ADCA), an extremely heterogeneous histological type, and
   a significant challenge for molecular subtyping. For testing and
   verification, we use high quality gene expression profiling data of lung
   ADCA patients, and identify prognostic gene signatures which could
   cluster patients into subgroups that are significantly different in
   their overall survival (with p-values < 0.05). Our results are only
   based on gene expression profiling data analysis, without incorporating
   any other feature selection or clinical information; we are able to
   replicate our findings with completely independent datasets. SPARCoC is
   broadly applicable to large-scale genomic data to empower pattern
   discovery and cancer gene identification.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies of new particle formation events in the atmosphere
   suggest that nanoclusters (i.e, the species formed during the early
   stages of particle growth which are composed of 10(-1)-10(-3) molecules)
   may consist of amines and sulfuric acid. The physicochemical properties
   of sub-10 nm amine-sulfuric acid clusters are hence of interest. In this
   work, we measure the density, thermostability, and extent of water
   uptake of <8.5 nm effective diameter dimethylamine-sulfuric (DMAS)
   nanoclusters in the gas phase, produced via positive electrospray
   ionization. Specifically, we employ three systems to investigate DMAS
   properties: ion mobility spectrometry (IMS, with a parallel-plate
   differential mobility analyzer) is coupled with mass spectrometry to
   measure masses and collision cross sections for <100 kDa positively
   charged nanoclusters, two differential mobility analyzers in series
   (IMSIMS) are used to examine thermostability, and finally a differential
   mobility analyzer coupled to an atmospheric pressure drift tube ion
   mobility spectrometer (also IMSIMS) is used for water uptake
   measurements. IMSMS measurements reveal that dry DMAS nanoclusters have
   densities of similar to 1567 kg/m(3) near 300 K, independent of the
   ratio of dimethylamine to sulfuric acid originally present in the
   electrospray solution. IMSIMS thermostability studies reveal that
   partial pressures of DMAS nanoclusters are dependent upon the
   electrospray solution concentration ratio, R = {[}H2SO4]/{[}(CH3)(2)NH].
   Extrapolating measurements, we estimate that dry DMAS nanoclusters have
   surface vapor pressures of order 10(-4) Pa near 300 K, with the surface
   vapor pressure increasing with increasing values of R through most of
   the probed concentration range. This suggests that nanocluster surface
   vapor pressures are substantially enhanced by capillarity effects (the
   Kelvin effect). Meanwhile, IMSIMS water uptake measurements show clearly
   that DMAS nanoclusters uptake water at relative humidities beyond 10\%
   near 300 K, and that larger clusters uptake water to a larger extent. In
   total, our results suggest that dry DMAS nanoclusters (in the 58.5 nm
   size range in diameter) would not be stable under ambient conditions;
   however, DMAS nanoclusters would likely be hydrated in the ambient (in
   some cases above 20\% water by mass), which could serve to reduce
   surface vapor pressures and stabilize them from dissociation.}},

Abstract = {{Airborne molecular contaminations (AMCs) represent a wide range of
   gaseous contaminants in cleanrooms. Due to the unintentional
   nanoparticle or haze formation as well as doping caused by AMCs,
   improved monitoring and controlling methods for AMCs are urgent in the
   semiconductor industry. However, measuring ultra-low concentrations of
   AMCs in cleanrooms is difficult, especially, behind a gas filter. In
   this study, a novel detection method for AMCs, which is on-line,
   economical, and applicable for diverse AMCs, was developed by employing
   gas-to-particle conversion with soft X-ray, and then measuring the
   generated nanoparticles. Feasibility study of this method was conducted
   through the evaluations of granular-activated carbons (GACs), which are
   widely used AMC filter media. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) was used as an AMC
   for the feasibility study. Using this method, the ultra-low
   concentrations of SO2 behind GACs were determined in terms of
   concentrations of generated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) nanoparticles. By
   calculating SO2 concentrations from the nanoparticle concentrations
   using empirical correlation equations between them, remarkable
   sensitivity of this method to SO2 was shown, down to
   parts-per-trillions, which are too low to detect using commercial gas
   sensors. Also, the calculated SO2 concentrations showed good agreement
   with those measured simultaneously by a commercial SO2 monitor at
   parts-per-billions.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer electrolytes are alternatives to liquid electrolytes
   traditionally used in electrochemical devices such as lithium-ion
   batteries and fuel cells. In particular, block polymer electrolytes are
   promising candidates because, they self-as,semble into well-defined
   microstructures, in which orthogonal properties can be integrated into a
   single material (e.g., high modulus in domain A, fast ion transport in
   domain B). However, the performance of-block polymer electrolytes often
   falls short, due to the lack of long-range continuity of both domains
   and relatively low strength. We recently reported a simple, one pot
   synthetic strategy to prepare polymer electrolytes with the highest
   reported combination of modulus and ionic conductivity, attributes
   enabled by a co-continuous, cross linked network morphology. In this
   work we arm to understand the mechanism by which this nanoscale
   morphology is, formed by performing a series of in situ, time-resolved
   experiments small angle X-ray scattering, conductivity, rheology, and
   reaction kinetics-to monitor the electrolyte as it transitions from a
   macroscopically homogeneous liquid to a microphase-separated solid. The
   results suggest that the chain connectivity of the diblock gives rise to
   isotropic concentration fluctuations that increase in amplitude and
   coherence such that the network morphology is ultimately produced, The
   kinetic trapping, of this network morphology by chemical cross-linking
   prior to the ordering transition is shown to be critically important to
   the resulting advantageous bulk electrolyte properties.}},

Abstract = {{Epoxidized soybean oil-based paper composites (ESOPCs) were prepared by
   fabricating poly epoxidized soybean oil (PESO) with paper. With boron
   trifluride diethyl etherate as catalyst, epoxidized soybean oil was in
   situ polymerized on the surface of the paper and within the interspaces
   of the paper cellulose fibers. Fourier transform infrared analysis
   confirmed the polymerization of epoxidized soybean oil. Scanning
   electron microscopic analysis showed that ESOPCs had nanostructured
   wrinkle morphology on the surfaces and the PESO combined tightly with
   the paper cellulose fibers. The tensile strength of ESOPCs was 17.3-24.8
   MPa, which was higher than that of most vegetable oil-based neat
   polymers. Thermogravimetric analysis indicated that ESOPCs were
   thermally stable up to 360 degrees C in a nitrogen atmosphere. Water
   vapor permeability (WVP) tests revealed that the WVP of ESOPCs was
   3.52-4.45 x 10(-12) g/m/s/Pa, significantly lower than many of other
   biobased polymeric materials, which would promote the application of
   vegetable-based polymers as potential water-resistant materials. (C)

Abstract = {{Nonlocal electromagnetic effects of graphene arise from its naturally

   nonlocal Maxwell's equations for graphene nanoribbon arrays with
   features around 100 nm, where we found prominent departures from its
   local response. Interestingly, the nonlocal corrections are stronger for
   light polarization parallel to the ribbons, which manifests as an
   additional broadening of the Drude peak. For the perpendicular
   polarization case, nonlocal effects lead to blue-shifts of the plasmon
   peaks. These manifestations provide a physical measure of nonlocal
   effects, and we quantify their dependence on the ribbon width, doping,
   and wavelength.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper the flow around a streambank-attached in-stream structure

   large-eddy simulation (LES). LES is carried out for the case where the
   rock vane is installed along the outer bank of a field-scale,
   natural-like experimental meandering channel facility. Analysis of the
   simulated flow field shows that the rock vane acts to displace the
   upstream high-velocity core toward the channel centre and it effectively
   reduces the bed shear stress along the outer streambank. It is also
   found that the presence of the rock vane gives rise to the growth of the
   secondary flow cell formed along the outer streambank, which is often
   called the outer bank cell. Numerical results suggest that the growth of
   the outer bank cell and the subsequent displacement of the outer bank
   shear layer are responsible for the displacement of channel thalweg

Abstract = {{The introduction of food wastes into anaerobic digestion (AD) brings a
   promising scenario of increasing feedstock availability and overall
   energy production from AD. This study evaluated the biodegradability and
   methane potential from co-digestion of two typical food wastes, kitchen
   waste and chicken fat, with dairy manure. For single substrate, the
   bio-methane potential assays showed that kitchen waste had the highest
   methane yield of 352 L-CH4 kg(-1)-VS added, 92\% more than dairy manure
   alone. Chicken fat at the same Volatile Solid (VS) level (2g L-1)
   inhibited bio-methane production. Addition of kitchen waste and chicken
   fat to a VS percentage of up to 40\% improved overall methane yield by
   44\% and 34\%, respectively. Synergistic effect was observed when either
   combining two or three substrates as AD feedstock, possibly as a result
   of increased biodegradability of organic materials in chicken fat and
   kitchen waste compared with dairy manure. Addition of chicken fat
   improved methane yield more than kitchen waste. However, addition of
   chicken fat VS over 0.8g L-1 should be cautiously done because it may
   cause reactor failure due to decrease in pH. The maximum methane yield
   was 425 L-CH4 kg(-1)-VS, achieved at a VS ratio of 2:2:1 for kitchen
   waste, chicken fat, and dairy manure. Results from batch AD experiment
   demonstrated that supplementing dairy manure to chicken fat and/or
   kitchen waste improved alkalinity of substrate due to the inclusion of
   more titratable bases in dairy manure, and therefore stabilized the
   methanogenesis and substantially improved biogas yield. A mixture of
   substrates of kitchen waste, chicken fat, and dairy manure at a ratio of
   1:1:3 was fed to a continuously stirred tank reactor operated at organic
   loading rates of 3.28, 6.55, and 2.18g-COD L-1-day (hydraulic retention
   time of 20, 10, and 30days, respectively) under mesophilic condition,
   and methane production rate reached 0.65, 0.95, and 0.34 L-CH4

Abstract = {{Reference electrodes are used in almost every electroanalytical
   measurement. Here, all-solid-state reference electrodes are described
   that employ colloid-imprinted mesoporous (CIM) carbon as solid contact
   and a poly(vinyl chloride) reference membrane to contact the sample.
   Such a reference membrane is doped with a moderately hydrophilic ionic
   liquid and a hydrophobic redox couple, leading to well-defined constant
   potentials at the interfaces of this membrane to the sample and to the
   solid contact, respectively. Due to the intrinsic properties of CIM
   carbon, reference electrodes with a CIM carbon solid contact exhibit
   excellent resistance to common interfering agents such as light and O-2,
   with outstanding potential stability in continuous potentiometric
   measurements. The potential drift of CIM carbon-based reference
   electrodes without redox couple is as low as 1.7 mu V/h over 110 h,
   making them the most stable all-solid-state reference electrodes
   reported so far. To demonstrate the compatibility of CIM carbon-based
   reference electrodes with miniaturized potentiometric systems, these
   reference electrodes were integrated into paper-based potentiometric
   sensing devices, successfully replacing the conventional reference
   electrode with its reference electrolyte solution. As a proof of
   concept, disposable paper-based Cl sensing devices that contain
   stencil-printed Ag/AgCl-based Cl- selective electrodes and CIM
   carbon-based reference electrodes were constructed. These sensing
   devices are inexpensive, easy to use, and offer highly reproducible Cl-
   measurements with sample volumes as low as 10 mu L.}},

Abstract = {{The reversible micellization and sol-gel transition of block copolymer
   solutions in an ionic liquid (IL) triggered by a photostimulus is
   described. The ABA triblock copolymer employed, denoted
   P(AzoMA-r-NIPAm)-b-PEO-b-P(AzoMA-r-NIPAm)), has a Bblock composed of an
   IL-soluble poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO). The Ablock consists of a random
   copolymer including thermosensitive N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAm) units
   and a methacrylate with an azobenzene chromophore in the side chain
   (AzoMA). A phototriggered reversible unimer-to-micelle transition of a
   dilute ABA triblock copolymer (1wt\%) was observed in an IL,
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ({[}C(4)mim]PF6), at an
   intermediate bistable temperature (50 degrees C). The system underwent a
   reversible sol-gel transition cycle at the bistable temperature (53
   degrees C), with reversible association/fragmentation of the polymer
   network resulting from the phototriggered self-assembly of the ABA
   triblock copolymer (20wt\%) in {[}C(4)mim]PF6.}},

Title = {{Heat transfer and pressure drop comparison of louver- and plain-finned
   heat exchangers where one fluid passes through flattened tubes}},
Journal = {{CASE STUDIES IN THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Pages = {{122-126}},

Abstract = {{Louvered fins constitute a major methodology for heat transfer
   enhancement. Of critical significance in evaluating the worthiness of
   such tins is the comparison between the heat transfer and pressure drop
   for a thus-tinned heat exchanger with the baseline case of a counterpart
   plain-finned heat exchanger. Up to the present, it appears that such
   comparisons are confined to heat exchangers in which one of the
   participating fluids passes through circular tubes. RI another basic
   geometry in which louvered tins have been employed, the aforementioned
   participating fluid passes through flattened tubes which are virtually
   rectangular in cross section. The focus of the present paper is to
   obtain results for the latter basic geometry for both louver-fin-based
   heat exchangers and counterpart plain-fin-based heat exchangers. The
   results were obtained by means of numerical simulation over a range of
   Reynolds numbers spanning approximately a factor of five. Over this
   range, enhancements of the heat transfer rate ranged from factors of
   approximately 22-2.8. Over this same Reynolds number range, the pressure
   drop increased by factors of 2.3-3.6. This outcome is attributable to
   the fact that the rate of heat transfer is less sensitive to the
   velocity than is the pressure drop. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.}},

   substrate temperatures between 300 and 900 degrees C. Three distinct
   growth regimes were identified where SnO2 films grew in a reaction-,
   flux-, and desorption-limited mode, respectively, with increasing
   substrate temperature. In particular, with increasing tin flux, the
   growth rates were found to increase and then saturate indicating any
   excess tin precursor desorbs above a critical beam equivalent pressure
   of tin precursor. Important implications of growth kinetic behaviors on

Title = {{Atomic layer deposition of tin oxide and zinc tin oxide using
   tetraethyltin and ozone}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY A}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Silicon or glass substrates exposed to sequential pulses of
   tetraethyltin (TET) and ozone (O-3) were coated with thin films of SnO2.
   Self-limiting deposition was found using 8 s pulse times, and a uniform
   thickness per cycle (TPC) of 0.2 nm/cycle was observed in a small, yet
   reproducible, temperature window from 290 to 320 degrees C. The
   as-deposited, stoichiometric SnO2 films were amorphous and transparent
   above 400 nm. Interspersing pulses of diethylzinc and O-3 among the
   TET:O-3 pulses resulted in deposition of zinc tin oxide films, where the
   fraction of tin, defined as {[}at. \% Sn/(at. \% Sn + at. \% Zn)], was
   controlled by the ratio of TET pulses, specifically nTET:(n(TET)+n(DEZ))
   where n(TET) and n(DEZ) are the number of precursor/O-3 subcycles within
   each atomic layer deposition (ALD) supercycle. Based on film thickness
   and composition measurements, the TET pulse time required to reach
   saturation in the TPC of SnO2 on ZnO surfaces was increased to >30 s.
   Under these conditions, film stoichiometry as a function of the TET
   pulse ratio was consistent with the model devised by Elliott and Nilsen.
   The as-deposited zinc tin oxide (ZTO) films were amorphous and remained
   so even after annealing at 450 degrees C in air for 1 h. The optical
   bandgap of the transparent ZTO films increased as the tin concentration
   increased. Hall measurements established that the n-type ZTO carrier
   concentration was 3 x 10(17) and 4 x 10(18) cm(-3) for fractional tin
   concentrations of 0.28 and 0.63, respectively. The carrier mobility
   decreased as the concentration of tin increased. A broken gap pn
   junction was fabricated using ALD-deposited ZTO and a sputtered layer of
   cuprous oxide. The junction demonstrated ohmic behavior and low
   resistance consistent with similar junctions prepared using
   sputter-deposited ZTO. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{We use Brownian dynamics with hydrodynamic interactions to calculate
   both the Kirkwood (short-time) diffusivity and the long-time diffusivity
   of DNA chains from free solution down to channel confinement in the de
   Gennes regime. The Kirkwood diffusivity in confinement is always higher
   than the diffusivity obtained from the mean-squared displacement of the
   center-of-mass, as is the case in free solution. Moreover, the
   divergence of the local diffusion tensor, which is non-zero in
   confinement, makes a negligible contribution to the latter diffusivity
   in confinement. The maximum error in the Kirkwood approximation in our
   simulations is about 2\% for experimentally relevant simulation times.
   The error decreases with increasing confinement, consistent with
   arguments from blob theory and the molecular-weight dependence of the
   error in free solution. In light of the typical experimental errors in
   measuring the properties of channel-confined DNA, our results suggest
   that the Kirkwood approximation is sufficiently accurate to model
   experimental data. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reviews ultrasound imaging methods for the guidance of
   therapeutic focused ultrasound (USgFUS), with emphasis on real-time
   preclinical methods. Guidance is interpreted in the broadest sense to

   monitoring of FUS-tissue interactions, and real-time control of exposure
   and damage assessment. The paper begins with an overview and brief
   historical background of the early methods used for monitoring
   FUS-tissue interactions. Current imaging methods are described, and
   discussed in terms of sensitivity and specificity of the localisation of
   the FUS effects in both therapeutic and sub-therapeutic modes. Thermal
   and non-thermal effects are considered. These include
   cavitation-enhanced heating, tissue water boiling and cavitation. Where
   appropriate, USgFUS methods are compared with similar methods
   implemented using other guidance modalities, e.g. magnetic resonance
   imaging. Conclusions are drawn regarding the clinical potential of the
   various guidance methods, and the feasibility and current status of

Abstract = {{The fluid flow environment associated with high Glossosoma abundance is
   predicted by large-eddy simulation of a natural turbulent open-channel
   flow. The spatial distribution of Glossosoma was depicted by high
   resolution physical variables described by fluid flow and streambed
   topography. Variogram analysis of the streambed topography revealed a
   characteristic length scale of the streambed of the order 0.2 m over
   which bed roughness height was correlated. Flow simulation output was
   spatially and temporally averaged over the streambed characteristic
   length scale and linked to Glossosoma spatial density. A dimensionless
   scaling relationship between Glossosoma spatial distribution and
   streamwise velocity averaged in the longitudinal and transverse
   direction, spatial velocity fluctuation, and spanwise vorticity from the
   computational fluid dynamics simulation output explained 79\% of the
   variation in observed dimensionless Glossosoma spatial density. The
   analysis demonstrated that computational fluid mechanics and high

Title = {{Photoacoustic lifetime imaging for direct in vivo tissue oxygen
   monitoring}},

Abstract = {{Measuring the partial pressure of oxygen (pO(2)) in tissue may provide
   physicians with essential information about the physiological state of
   tissue. However, currently available methods for measuring or imaging
   tissue pO(2) have significant limitations, preventing them from being
   widely used in clinics. Recently, we have reported a direct and
   noninvasive in vivo imaging modality based on the photoacoustic lifetime
   which overcomes certain drawbacks of the existing methods. The technique
   maps the excited triplet state of oxygen-sensitive dye, thus reflecting
   the spatial and temporal distributions of tissue oxygen. Here, we
   present two studies which apply photoacoustic lifetime imaging (PALI) to
   monitor changes of tissue oxygen induced by external modulations. The
   first study modulates tissue oxygen by controlling the percentage of
   oxygen a normal mouse inhales. We demonstrate that PALI is able to
   reflect the change in oxygen level with respect to normal, oxygen-rich,
   and oxygenpoor breathing conditions. The second study involves an acute
   ischemia model using a thin thread tied around the hindlimb of a normal
   mouse to reduce the blood flow. PALI images were acquired before,
   during, and after the restriction. The drop of tissue pO(2) and recovery
   from hypoxia due to reperfusion were tracked and observed by PALI. (C)

Abstract = {{Quantitative investigations of fiber orientation and structural
   connectivity at microscopic resolution have led to great challenges for
   current neuroimaging techniques. Here, we present a structure tensor
   (ST) analysis of ex vivo rat brain images acquired by a multicontrast
   (MC) serial optical coherence scanner. The ST considers the gradients of
   images in local neighbors to generate a matrix whose eigen-decomposition
   can estimate the local features such as the edges, anisotropy, and
   orientation of tissue constituents. This computational analysis is
   applied on the conventional-and polarization-based contrasts of optical
   coherence tomography. The three-dimensional (3-D) fiber orientation maps
   are computed from the image stacks of sequential scans both at
   mesoresolution for a global view and at high-resolution for the details.
   The computational orientation maps demonstrate a good agreement with the
   optic axis orientation contrast which measures the in-plane fiber
   orientation. Moreover, tractography is implemented using the directional
   information extracted from the 3-D ST. The study provides a unique
   opportunity to leverage MC high-resolution information to map structural
   connectivity of the whole brain. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{An experimental study of thermal convection in a porous medium
   investigates the heat transfer across a horizontal layer heated from
   below at high Rayleigh number. Using a packed bed of polypropylene
   spheres in a cubic enclosure saturated with compressed argon, the
   pressure was varied between 5.6 bar and 77 bar to obtain fluid Rayleigh
   numbers between 1.68 x 10(9) and 3.86 x 10(11), corresponding to
   Rayleigh-Darcy numbers between 7.47 x 10(3) and 2.03 x 10(6). From the
   present and earlier studies of Rayleigh-Benard convection in both porous
   media and homogeneous fluid systems, the existence and importance of a
   thin thermal boundary layer are clearly demonstrated. In addition to
   identifying the governing role of the thermal boundary layer at high
   Rayleigh numbers, the successful correlation of data using homogeneous
   fluid dimensionless groups when the thermal boundary layer thickness
   becomes smaller than the length scale associated with the pore features
   is shown.}},

Title = {{Positive contraction mappings for classical and quantum Schrodinger
   systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The classical Schrodinger bridge seeks the most likely probability law
   for a diffusion process, in path space, that matches marginals at two
   end points in time; the likelihood is quantified by the relative entropy
   between the sought law and a prior. Jamison proved that the new law is
   obtained through a multiplicative functional transformation of the
   prior. This transformation is characterised by an automorphism on the
   space of endpoints probability measures, which has been studied by
   Fortet, Beurling, and others. A similar question can be raised for
   processes evolving in a discrete time and space as well as for processes
   defined over non-commutative probability spaces. The present paper
   builds on earlier work by Pavon and Ticozzi and begins by establishing
   solutions to Schrodinger systems for Markov chains. Our approach is
   based on the Hilbert metric and shows that the solution to the
   Schrodinger bridge is provided by the fixed point of a contractive map.
   We approach, in a similar manner, the steering of a quantum system
   across a quantum channel. We are able to establish existence of quantum
   transitions that are multiplicative functional transformations of a
   given Kraus map for the cases where the marginals are either uniform or
   pure states. As in the Markov chain case, and for uniform density
   matrices, the solution of the quantum bridge can be constructed from the
   fixed point of a certain contractive map. For arbitrary marginal
   densities, extensive numerical simulations indicate that iteration of a
   similar map leads to fixed points from which we can construct a quantum
   bridge. For this general case, however, a proof of convergence remains
   elusive. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Pages = {{76-86}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Engineered transport of material at the nano/micro scale is essential
   for the manufacturing platforms of the future. Unlike conventional
   transport systems, at the nano/micro scale, transport has to be
   achieved. in the presence of fundamental sources of uncertainty such as
   thermal noise. Remarkably, it is possible to extract useful work by
   rectifying noise using an asymmetric potential; a principle used by
   Brownian ratchets. In this article a systematic methodology for
   designing open-loop Brownian ratchet mechanisms that optimize velocity
   and efficiency is developed. In the case where the particle position is
   available as a measured variable, closed loop methodologies are studied.
   Here, it is shown that Methods that strive to optimize velocity of
   transport may compromise efficiency. A dynamic programming based
   approach is presented which yields up to three times improvement in
   efficiency over optimized open loop designs and 35\% better efficiency
   over reported closed loop strategies that focus on optimizing
   velocities. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Proton transfer across single-layer graphene proceeds with large
   computed energy barriers and is therefore thought to be unfavourable at
   room temperature unless nanoscale holes or dopants are introduced, or a
   potential bias is applied. Here we subject single-layer graphene
   supported on fused silica to cycles of high and low pH, and show that
   protons transfer reversibly from the aqueous phase through the graphene
   to the other side where they undergo acid-base chemistry with the silica
   hydroxyl groups. After ruling out diffusion through macroscopic
   pinholes, the protons are found to transfer through rare, naturally
   occurring atomic defects. Computer simulations reveal low energy
   barriers of 0.61-0.75 eV for aqueous proton transfer across
   hydroxyl-terminated atomic defects that participate in a Grotthuss-type
   relay, while pyrylium-like ether terminations shut down proton exchange.
   Unfavourable energy barriers to helium and hydrogen transfer indicate
   the process is selective for aqueous protons.}},

   upon annual feedstock consumption), the sensitivity of major cost
   components for the novel facilities, and the implications of policy
   levers on the economic feasibility of the solar facilities. Findings

   strategies derived from the presentations and discussion described in
   these sectors were voted on subsequently for purposes of prioritization.
   The following proceedings include the knowledge and research shared by
   invited faculty, many of whom are health care providers and clinical
   investigators. The Summit II evidence-based action plan emphasizes the
   rapidly evolving scientific content of hockey SRC. It includes the most

Abstract = {{Analytical fault detection algorithms have the potential to reduce the
   size, power and weight of safety-critical aerospace systems. Analytical
   redundancy has been successfully applied in many non-safety critical
   applications. However, acceptance for aerospace applications will
   require new methods to rigorously certify the impact of such algorithms
   on the overall system reliability. This paper presents a theoretical
   method to assess the probabilistic performance for an analytically
   redundant system. Specifically, a fault tolerant actuation system is
   considered. The system consists of dual-redundant actuators and an
   analytical fault detection algorithm to switch between the hardware
   components. The exact system failure rate per hour is computed using the
   law of total probability. This analysis requires knowledge of the
   failure rates for the hardware components. In addition, knowledge of
   specific probabilistic performance metrics for the fault detection logic
   is needed. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the proposed
   analysis method.}},

Abstract = {{This work examines numerical simulation of supersonic, subsonic, and
   transonic flows over a bluff body using several numerical techniques.
   Comparisons between computational fluid dynamics predictions and
   wind-tunnel test data are shown. The wind-tunnel test used a
   7.66\%-scale model of the crew module for NASA's multipurpose crew
   vehicle. A variety of freestream conditions consisting of three Mach
   numbers and three angles of attack are considered. The wind-tunnel test
   data include time-averaged integrated forces and moments, static
   pressure port measurements, and unsteady frequency response. Results
   obtained using the Spalart-Allmaras Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes
   turbulence model are compared to solutions computed using detached-eddy
   simulation. Furthermore, low-dissipation numerical fluxes are applied in
   order to assess their effect on solution fidelity. Across the cases
   examined, the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes model has difficulty
   matching the vehicle surface pressures. For supersonic and transonic
   flows, detached-eddy simulation agrees well with the experiment.
   Subsonic flows still prove difficult for the methods explored in this
   work, but detached-eddy simulation and low-dissipation numerical fluxes
   provide the most accurate prediction of the test data.}},

   reconcile the apparent contradictions in experiments on the effect of
   shear flow on desorption of polymers. Our simulations show that
   desorption is governed by an interplay between chain-wall attraction and
   wall-induced hydrodynamic repulsion. When adsorption is weak, the chains
   form large loops and tails that generate stronger hydrodynamic
   interactions in the presence of the imposed shear flow, causing longer
   chains to desorb faster than shorter ones. In contrast, when adsorption
   is strong, the chains adopt a flattened conformation, weakening
   hydrodynamic interactions and resulting in shorter chains with fewer
   sticking points desorbing faster than longer ones.}},

Abstract = {{We experimentally show that terahertz (THz) waves confined in sub-10 nm
   metallic gaps can detect refractive index changes caused by only a 1 nm
   thick (similar to lambda/106) dielectric overlayer. We use atomic layer
   lithography to fabricate a wafer-scale array of annular nanogaps. Using
   THz time-domain spectroscopy in conjunction with atomic layer
   deposition, we measure spectral shifts of a THz resonance peak with
   increasing Al2O3 film thickness in 1 nm intervals. Because of the
   enormous mismatch in length scales between THz waves and sub-10 nm gaps,
   conventional modeling techniques cannot readily be used to analyze our
   results. We employ an advanced finite-element-modeling (FEM) technique,
   Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) scheme, for full

Abstract = {{We designed Lactococcus lactis to detect Enterococcus faecalis. Upon
   detection, L. lactis produce and secrete antienterococcal peptides. The
   peptides inhibit enterococcal growth and reduce viability of enterococci
   in the vicinity of L. lactis. The enterococcal sex pheromone cCF10
   serves as the signal for detection. Expression vectors derived from
   pCF10, a cCF10-responsive E. faecalis sex-pheromone conjugative plasmid,
   were engineered in L. lactis for the detection system. Recombinant host
   strains were engineered to express genes for three bacteriocins,
   enterocin A, hiracin JM79 and enterocin P, each with potent
   antimicrobial activity against E. faecalis. Sensitive detection and
   specific inhibition occur both in agar and liquid media. The engineered
   L. lactis also inhibited growth of multidrug-resistant E. faecium
   strains, when induced by cCF10. The presented vectors and strains can be
   components of a toolbox for the development of alternative antibiotic
   technologies targeting enterococci at the site of infection.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To present currently known basic science and on-ice
   influences of sport-related concussion (SRC) in hockey, building on the
   Ice Hockey Summit I action plan (2011) to reduce SRC.
   Methods: The prior summit proceedings included an action plan intended
   to reduce SRC. As such, the proceedings from Summit I served as a point
   of departure, for the science and discussion held during Summit II (Mayo
   Clinic, Rochester MN, October 2013). Summit II focused on (1) Basic
   Science of Concussions in Ice Hockey: Taking Science Forward; (2) Acute
   and Chronic Concussion Care: Making a Difference; (3) Preventing
   Concussions via Behavior, Rules, Education and Measuring Effectiveness;
   (4) Updates in Equipment: their Relationship to Industry Standards; and
   (5) Policies and Plans at State, National and Federal Levels to reduce
   SRC. Action strategies derived from the presentations and discussion
   described in these sectors were subsequently voted on for purposes of
   prioritization. The following proceedings include knowledge and research
   shared by invited faculty, many of whom are health care providers and
   clinical investigators.
   Results: The Summit II evidence-based action plan emphasizes the rapidly
   evolving scientific content of hockey SRC. It includes the most highly
   prioritized strategies voted on for implementation to decrease
   concussion.
   Conclusions: The highest priority action items identified from the
   Summit includes the following: (1) eliminate head hits from all levels
   of ice hockey, (2) change body-checking policies, and (3) eliminate
   fighting in all amateur and professional hockey.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider computational methods for optimizing a
   multivariate inhomogeneous polynomial function over a general convex
   set. The focus is on the design and analysis of polynomial-time
   approximation algorithms. The methods are able to deal with optimization
   models with polynomial objective functions in any fixed degrees. In
   particular, we first study the problem of maximizing an inhomogeneous
   polynomial over the Euclidean ball. A polynomial-time approximation
   algorithm is proposed for this problem with an assured (relative)
   worst-case performance ratio, which is dependent only on the dimensions
   of the model. The method and approximation ratio are then generalized to
   optimize an inhomogeneous polynomial over the intersection of a finite
   number of co-centered ellipsoids. Furthermore, the constraint set is
   extended to a general convex compact set. Specifically, we propose a
   polynomial-time approximation algorithm with a (relative) worst-case
   performance ratio for polynomial optimization over some convex compact
   sets, e.g., a polytope. Finally, numerical results are reported,
   revealing good practical performance of the proposed algorithms for
   solving some randomly generated instances.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{83-89}},

Abstract = {{Legislation and sentiment have pushed large-animal electrophysiological
   research from the canine to the swine model. Anecdotal experience
   suggests that the swine is particularly sensitive to ventricular
   fibrillation (VF) induction, and radiofrequency ablation studies are
   consistent with this. Currently, no data exist directly comparing the VF
   threshold (VFT) in humans to swine. Because of the perceived difference
   in vulnerability to VF induction, we hypothesized that the VFT would be
   lower in swine compared to humans.
   Six anesthetized open-chested swine, 31 +/- 2 kg, were studied that were
   part of an ongoing study with up to 6 h of previous closed-chest
   percutaneous pacing with repeated VF cycles. Similar to the human study
   of Horowitz et al., 24 pulses of 4 ms each were applied at a rate of 100
   Hz during the ST segment to the epicardium via a pair of 7-mm diameter
   platinum electrodes whose centers were 15 mm apart. Current was
   increased until VF was induced.
   The swine right ventricle (RV) VFT was 9.7 +/- 2.1 mA {[}median = 9.0,
   interquartile range (IQR) = 7.8-12.0], and the left ventricle (LV) VFT
   was 10.7 +/- 2.2 mA {[}median = 10.5, IQR = 8.8-12.5] (p = NS). Horowitz
   reported the RV VFT in six patients as 24.3 +/- 5.2 mA {[}median = 24.5,
   IQR = 19.0-29.3] and the LV VFT in ten patients as 33.6 +/- 9.5 mA
   {[}median = 36.5, IQR = 27.3-42.3] (p = .11). Both the RV and LV VFTs
   were lower for swine (p < 0.003), and each of the mean and median VFTs
   for the ventricles together was one third that of the humans.
   Swine are about three times as sensitive to the electrical induction of
   VF as are humans.}},

Abstract = {{This study reports the preparation and characterization of CuZnSnS4
   (CZTS) thin films by a non-toxic sol-gel technique. The CZTS thin films
   were prepared on Molybdenum substrates and annealed in various
   atmospheres viz. N-2 gas, Sulphur (S) powder and H2S gas. The effects of
   various annealing atmospheres on the morphological, structural,
   compositional and optical properties of the CZTS thin films were
   investigated. The field emission scanning electron microscopy studies on
   the as-deposited CZTS thin film showed that the film consisted
   nanocrystalline CZTS grains while all the annealed films were highly
   compact, uniform, and that the thickness varied from 1,884 to 832 nm.
   The X-ray diffraction and Raman studies on the CZTS thin films showed
   formation of the kesterite structure without any secondary phases. All
   the CZTS thin films were nearly stoichiometric with slightly Zn rich
   composition which is favorable for a high photovoltaic performance of
   solar cells. Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy study on all the CZTS
   thin films showed an asymmetric broad band emission. The direct band gap
   energy of the CZTS thin films was found to be between 1.3 and 1.6 eV, as
   confirmed by PL study. The S powder-annealed CZTS thin film was further
   used for the fabrication of a solar cell of structure
   SLG/Mo/CZTS/CdS/i-ZnO/AZO/Al grid. The best solar cell showed a
   short-circuit current density of 7.19 mA/cm(2), open-circuit voltage of
   270 mV, fill factor of 39 \% and power conversion efficiency of 0.77 \%
   under air mass 1.5 (100 mW/cm(2)) illumination.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue proteomics is increasingly recognized for its role in biomarker
   discovery and disease mechanism investigation. However, protein
   solubility remains a significant challenge in mass spectrometry
   (MS)-based tissue proteomics. Conventional surfactants such as sodium
   dodecyl sulfate (SDS), the preferred surfactant for protein
   solubilization, are not compatible with MS. Herein, we have screened a
   library of surfactant-like compounds and discovered an MS-compatible
   degradable surfactant (MaSDeS) for tissue proteomics that solubilizes
   all categories of proteins with performance comparable to SDS. The use
   of MaSDeS in the tissue extraction significantly improves the total
   number of protein identifications from commonly used tissues, including
   tissue from the heart, liver, and lung. Notably, MaSDeS significantly
   enriches membrane proteins, which are often under-represented in
   proteomics studies. The acid degradable nature of MaSDeS makes it
   amenable for high-throughput MS-based proteomics. In addition, the
   thermostability of MaSDeS allows for its use in experiments requiring
   high temperature to facilitate protein extraction and solubilization.
   Furthermore, we have shown that MaSDeS outperforms the other
   MS-compatible surfactants in terms of overall protein solubility and the
   total number of identified proteins in tissue proteomics. Thus, the use
   of MaSDeS will greatly advance tissue proteomics and realize its
   potential in basic biomedical and clinical research. MaSDeS could be
   utilized in a variety of proteomics studies as well as general
   biochemical and biological experiments that employ surfactants for
   protein solubilization.}},

Volume = {{19}},

Pages = {{553-559}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this case series was to evaluate the new bone formation
   following guided bone regeneration (GBR) with a calcium phosphosilicate
   (CPS), alloplastic bone putty at peri-implant dehiscence defects and to
   assess survival rate of implants placed in the augmented sites after 12
   months of function.
   Implants were placed in patients exhibiting Seibert class I ridge
   defects resulting in peri-implant dehiscence defects. The defects were
   treated following GBR principles with the use of a CPS alloplastic bone
   graft putty in combination either with a collagen membrane or a titanium
   mesh. The height of each bony dehiscence was clinically measured at the
   time of implant placement and again during second-stage surgery. The
   percentage of complete defect coverage, frequency of adverse events, and
   risk factors for residual defect were determined.
   Thirty-six implants were placed in 26 patients. Twenty-seven of the 36
   sites employed a collagen membrane in conjunction with the CPS while the
   remaining nine sites utilized a titanium membrane. Mean gain in bone
   height was 3.23 +/- 2.04 mm, with 75 \% of the peri-implant defects
   achieving complete regeneration. A negative correlation was identified
   between patient age and complete coverage of the peri-implant defect (p
   = 0.026). The implant survival rate at 12 months was 97.22 \%.
   Use of CPS bone putty during delayed implant placement at peri-implant
   dehiscence sites either in combination with a collagen membrane or a
   titanium mesh results in predictable defect coverage.
   The handling characteristics of CPS putty may simplify GBR protocol.
   Implants placed in conjunction with GBR have a very good survival rate
   after 1 year of follow-up.}},

Title = {{Multi-level hp-adaptivity: high-order mesh adaptivity without the
   difficulties of constraining hanging nodes}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{499-517}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The implementation of h(P)-adaptivity is challenging as hanging nodes,
   edges, and faces have to be constrained to ensure compatibility of the
   shape functions. For this reason, most h(P)-code frameworks restrict
   themselves to 1-irregular meshes to ease the implementational effort.
   This work alleviates these difficulties by introducing a new formulation
   for high-order mesh adaptivity that provides full local h(P)-refinement
   capabilities at a comparably small implementational effort. Its main
   idea is the extension of the h(P)-d-method such that it allows for
   high-order overlay meshes yielding a hierarchical, multi-level
   h(P)-formulation of the Finite Element Method. This concept enables
   intuitive refinement and coarsening procedures, while linear
   independence and compatibility of the shape functions are guaranteed by
   construction. The proposed method is demonstrated to achieve exponential
   rates of convergence-both in terms of degrees of freedom and in
   run-time-for problems with non-smooth solutions. Furthermore, the scheme
   is used alongside the Finite Cell Method to simulate the heat flow
   around moving objects on a non-conforming background mesh and is
   combined with an energy-based refinement indicator for automatic
   h(P)-adaptivity.}},

Abstract = {{Simulated allocation models (SAMs) are used to evaluate organ allocation
   policies. An important component of SAMs is a module that decides
   whether each potential recipient will accept an offered organ. The
   objective of this study was to develop and test accept-or-decline
   classifiers based on several machine-learning methods in an effort to
   improve the SAM for liver allocation. Feature selection and imbalance
   correction methods were tested and best approaches identified for
   application to organ transplant data. Then, we used 2011 liver match-run
   data to compare classifiers based on logistic regression, support vector
   machines, boosting, classification and regression trees, and Random
   Forests. Finally, because the accept-or-decline module will be embedded
   in a simulation model, we also developed an evaluation tool for
   comparing performance of predictors, which we call sample-path accuracy.
   The Random Forest method resulted in the smallest overall error rate,
   and boosting techniques had greater accuracy when both sensitivity and
   specificity were simultaneously considered important. Our comparisons
   show that no method dominates all others on all performance measures of
   interest. A logistic regression-based classifier is easy to implement
   and allows for pinpointing the contribution of each feature toward the
   probability of acceptance. Other methods we tested did not have a
   similar interpretation. The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients
   decided to use the logistic regression-based accept-decline decision
   module in the next generation of liver SAM.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of using
   solubility parameter as guidance for the design and identification of a
   stable micellar system with a high drug loading capacity for oral drug
   delivery. Using hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) as a model drug, the effect
   of three hydrophobic blocks (fatty glycerides) grafted onto chitosan on
   the drug loading and stability of HCPT-loaded micellar nanoparticles
   formed by pH precipitation method were studied systematically. The
   Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (chi(FH)) calculated by the group
   contribution method (GCM) and molecular dynamics simulation (MDS) was
   used to assess the compatibility between HCPT and the copolymers. The
   predicted order of compatibility between three chitosan derivatives and
   HCPT was verified experimentally. A high drug loading and remarkably
   stable micellar system for oral administration based on succinylated
   glycerol monooleate-chitosan was discovered in this study. Our study
   suggests that the miscibility between drug and copolymer is crucial to
   drug loading and stability of the micellar system. Thus, the calculation
   of ?FH using GCM and MDS methods is useful for guiding the design or
   screening of a suitable copolymer for preparing drug-loaded micellar

Abstract = {{Nonviral gene transfection mediated by cationic polymer/DNA polyplexes
   often imposes stress and toxicity to cells. To better understand the
   relationship between cellular stress responses and polyplex-mediated
   transfection, polyplex-induced early autophagy in mouse fibroblasts was
   characterized and the impact of autophagy modulation on transgene
   expression evaluated. Transmission electron microscopy revealed the
   formation of double-membraned autophagosome in the cytoplasm of
   polyplex-transfected cells. Immunofluorescence staining and microscopy
   revealed intracellular LC3 punctation that was characteristic of early
   autophagy activation. Elevated expression of autophagosome-associated
   LC3 II protein was also detected by Western blot. When cells were
   treated with small-molecule modulators of autophagy, polyplex-mediated
   gene transfection efficiency was significantly affected. 3-Methyladenine
   (3-MA), an early autophagy inhibitor, reduced transfection efficiency,
   whereas rapamycin, an autophagy inducer, enhanced transgene expression.
   Importantly, the observed functional impact on gene transfection by
   autophagy modulation was decoupled from that of other modes of cellular
   stress response (apoptosis/necrosis). Treatment of cells by 3-MA or
   rapamycin did not affect the level of intracellular reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) but did decrease or increase, respectively, nuclear
   localization of polyplex-delivered plasmid DNA. These findings suggest
   new possibilities of enhancing polyplex-mediated gene delivery by
   codelivery of small-molecule regulators of autophagy.}},

Abstract = {{We explored the use of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to
   evaluate the crystallinity of griseofulvin (GF)/hydroxypropyl
   methylcellulose acetate succinate (HPMCAS) solid dispersions. TEM, which
   provides both real-space images and electron diffraction patterns, was
   used to unambiguously identify GF crystals in spray dried GF. Using TEM,
   we were also able to detect GF crystals in a physical mixture of spray
   dried GF particles and spray dried HPMCAS particles with an overall
   crystallinity of similar to 3 vol \%, below the practical lower limit of
   detection for laboratory-scale wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). Using
   TEM and WAXS, we did not find crystals in GF/HPMCAS solid dispersions
   with GF loadings of 5, 10, and 50 wt \%. However, we detected GF
   crystals in annealed 5 wt \% GF solid dispersion using TEM, whereas we
   did not detect crystals using in situ WAXS and modulated differential
   scanning calorimetry, thereby establishing the superior crystal
   detection sensitivity of TEM. We also performed TEM analysis of the in
   situ growth of GF crystals in a TEM sample of 50 wt \% GF solid
   dispersion. Based on this study, TEM has significant potential for
   characterizing even small degrees of crystallinity in solid dispersions.}},

Abstract = {{Drug carriers in the approximate to 100 nm size range are of
   considerable interest in the field of cancer therapy because of their
   ability to passively accumulate in tumors. Tailoring the physicochemical
   properties of these carriers to individual patient requirements will
   help exploit their full therapeutic potential. Here, we present a
   pharmacokinetic model to explain how vascular physiology could be used
   to guide the optimal choice of specific formulation parameters. We find
   that in order to maximize the benefit-to-risk ratio, nanosystems should
   be confined to a specific particle size range. The optimal particle size
   range is dictated by the vascular pore size of not only the tumor tissue
   but also of the normal organs. Additionally, the duration of drug
   release is a key variable that can be used to maximize the therapeutic
   benefit of nanomedicine. Our model further suggests that the enhanced
   permeability and retention effect is not necessarily a universal outcome
   for every nanocarrier in every tumor model but will only be observed for
   nanoparticles of a specific size range. This optimal size range, in
   turn, is governed by the vascular physiology of the tumor and of
   non-target organs. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Abstract = {{Microalgal biofilms grown to evaluate potential nutrient removal options
   for wastewaters and feedstock for biofuels production were studied to
   determine the influence of bicarbonate amendment on their growth,
   nutrient uptake capacity, and lipid accumulation after nitrogen
   starvation. No significant differences in growth rates, nutrient
   removal, or lipid accumulation were observed in the algal biofilms with
   or without bicarbonate amendment. The biofilms possibly did not
   experience carbon-limited conditions because of the large reservoir of
   dissolved inorganic carbon in the medium. However, an increase in
   photosynthetic rates was observed in algal biofilms amended with
   bicarbonate. The influence of bicarbonate on photosynthetic and
   respiration rates was especially noticeable in biofilms that experienced
   nitrogen stress. Medium nitrogen depletion was not a suitable stimulant
   for lipid production in the algal biofilms and as such, focus should be
   directed toward optimizing growth and biomass productivities to
   compensate for the low lipid yields and increase nutrient uptake. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the relationship between EEG source
   localization and the number of scalp EEG recording channels.
   Methods: 128 EEG channel recordings of 5 pediatric patients with
   medically intractable partial epilepsy were used to perform source
   localization of interictal spikes. The results were compared with
   surgical resection and intracranial recordings. Various electrode
   configurations were tested and a series of computer simulations based on
   a realistic head boundary element model were also performed in order to
   further validate the clinical findings.
   Results: The improvement seen in source localization substantially
   decreases as the number of electrodes increases. This finding was
   evaluated using the surgical resection, intracranial recordings and
   computer simulation. It was also shown in the simulation that increasing
   the electrode numbers could remedy the localization error of deep
   sources. A plateauing effect was seen in deep and superficial sources
   with further increasing the electrode number.
   Conclusion: The source localization is improved when electrode numbers
   increase, but the absolute improvement in accuracy decreases with
   increasing electrode number.
   Significance: Increasing the electrode number helps decrease
   localization error and thus can more ably assist the physician to better
   plan for surgical procedures. (C) 2014 International Federation of

Abstract = {{Phosphorus (P) is an essential fertilizer for agricultural production
   but is also a potent aquatic pollutant. Current P management fails to
   adequately address both the issue of food security due to P scarcity and
   P pollution threats to water bodies. As centers of food consumption and
   waste production, cities transport and store much P and thus provide
   important opportunities to improve P management. Substance flow analysis
   (SFA) is often used to understand urban P cycling and to identify
   inefficiencies that may be improved on. However, SFAs typically do not
   examine the factors that drive observed P dynamics. Understanding the
   social, ecological, and technological context of P stocks and flows is
   necessary to link urban P management to existing urban priorities and to
   select local management options that minimize tradeoffs and maximize
   synergies across priorities. Here, we review P SFA studies in 18 cities,
   focusing on gaps in the knowledge required to implement P management
   solutions. We develop a framework to systemically explore the full suite
   of factors that drive P dynamics in urban systems. By using this
   framework, scientists and managers can build a better understanding of
   the drivers of P cycling and improve our ability to address
   unsustainable P use and waste. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recently developed wet mills (bead mills) have been shown capable of
   dispersing nanopartide aggregates into primary particles in suspension,
   even with nanoparticles with primary particle radii as small as 5 nm and
   at high nanoparticle volume fractions (>1\%). However, to date what has
   not been examined is the change in aggregate morphology during milling
   itself, i.e. it is not clear if wet milling simplyfragments aggregates
   into smaller, similarly structured entities, or if milling an
   simultaneously lead to aggregate restructuring. Here we develop and
   apply methods to examine the change in morphology in titania and alumina
   nanoparticle aggregates (primary particle radii of similar to 8.25 nm
   and 7.20 nm, respectively) during wet milling with a Kotobuki Industries
   UAM-015 wet mill. Specifically, via nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA)
   with a Nanosight LM-14 and simultaneous viscosity measurements, we
   characterized the hydrodynamic radius distribution functions and average
   intrinsic viscosities of both titania and alumina aggregates milled at
   1\% volume fraction in water. With NTA we found that for both particle
   types, milling led to a reduction in hydrodynamic radii. Conversely, the
   average intrinsic viscosity of titania decreased, while it increased for
   alumina with increasing milling time. By assuming aggregates were
   quasifractal in niorphology (and hence characterized by the number of
   primary per particles per aggregate, the pre-exponential factor, and the
   fractal dimension) and by using Monte Carlo based techniques to link
   quasifractal aggregate descriptors to both the hydrodynamic radius and
   the intrinsic viscosity for an aggregate, measured hydrodynamic radius
   distribution functions and average intrinsic viscosities were used to
   infer titania and alumina aggregate quasifractal descriptors as
   functions of milling time. Through this analysis we found that both
   particle types were initially dense aggregates (fractal dimensions
   >2.9), and for titania milling did not alter aggregate morphology (i.e.
   titania aggregates remained dense). However, alumina aggregates were
   found to decrease in fractal dimension with increasing milling time,
   reaching a value near 1.6 after 180 minutes of milling. Such chain-like
   structures give rise to an increase in suspension viscosity despite the
   fact that alumina aggregate size decreased with milling. Overall, we
   show that depending on the particle material (and surfactant employed),
   milling may simultaneously lead to aggregate size reduction and
   restructuring, and may be a viable approach to the production of
   controlled morphology aggregates. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Wideband spectrum sensing is a fundamental component of cognitive radio
   and other applications. A novel frugal sensing scheme was recently
   proposed as ameans of crowd-sourcing the task of spectrum sensing. Using
   a network of scattered low-end sensors transmitting randomly filtered
   power measurement bits to a fusion center, a non-parametric approach to
   spectral estimation was adopted to estimate the ambient power spectrum.
   Here, a parametric spectral estimation approach is considered within the
   context of frugal sensing. Assuming a Moving-Average (MA) representation
   for the signal of interest, the problem of estimating admissible MA
   parameters, and thus the MA power spectrum, from single bit quantized
   data is formulated. This turns out being a non-convex quadratically
   constrained quadratic program (QCQP), which is NP-Hard in general.
   Approximate solutions can be obtained via semi-definite relaxation (SDR)
   followed by randomization; but this rarely produces a feasible solution
   for this particular kind of QCQP. A new Sequential Parametric Convex
   Approximation (SPCA) method is proposed for this purpose, which can be
   initialized from an infeasible starting point, and yet still produce a
   feasible point for the QCQP, when one exists, with high probability.
   Simulations not only reveal the superior performance of the parametric
   techniques over the globally optimum solutions obtained from the
   non-parametric formulation, but also the better performance of the SPCA
   algorithm over the SDR technique.}},

Abstract = {{Cancer is a disease that results from alterations in the cellular
   genome. Several recent studies have identified mutational signatures
   that implicate a variety of mutagenic processes in cancer, a major one
   of which is explained by the enzymatic activity of the DNA cytosine
   deaminase, APOBEC3B. As a deaminase, APOBEC3B converts cytosines to
   uracils in single-stranded DNA. Failure to properly repair these uracil
   lesions can result in a diverse array of mutations. For instance, DNA
   uracils can template the insertion of complementary adenines leading to
   C-to-T transition mutations. DNA uracils can also be converted into
   abasic sites that, depending upon the DNA polymerase recruited to bypass
   this lesion in the template strand, can lead to adenine insertion and
   C-to-T mutations as well as cytosine insertion and C-to-G transversion
   mutations. Finally, DNA uracils can also be converted into DNA breaks
   that may precipitate some types of larger chromosomal aberrations
   observed in cancer. These studies cumulatively demonstrate that APOBEC3B
   is a major source of genetic heterogeneity in several human cancers and,
   as such, this enzyme may prove to be a critical diagnostic and
   therapeutic target.}},

Abstract = {{Pulse width modulation (PWM) converters generate switching common-mode
   voltages (CMVs) across the load terminals. These voltages cause
   common-mode currents, leading to bearing failure in motor loads and

   carrier-based PWM technique for open-end winding motor drives that
   completely eliminates switching CMV. The proposed method is applicable
   to both dual two-level voltage source inverter and dual matrix
   converter-based open-end winding drives. Detailed analysis shows that
   the carrier-based method requires significantly less computation
   compared to the corresponding space vector implementation. This paper
   also outlines the relationship between the two implementations. The
   carrier-based method is shown to achieve superior performance in terms
   of resource requirements and execution time when implemented on a

Abstract = {{A solid-state transformer is a three-phase ac/ac converter with a
   high-frequency transformer. Due to advanced features like high power
   density, on demand var support and frequency regulation, solid-state
   transformer is an enabling technology for the modern power distribution
   system. It can also find application in high-power-density motor drives.
   The single-stage solid-state transformer considered in this paper is
   capable of bidirectional power flow and open loop power factor
   correction. This topology uses a minimum amount of copper and has
   relatively few semiconductor switches. One major problem in this
   converter is the commutation of leakage energy which results in power
   loss, reduction in switching frequency, loss of output voltage, and
   additional common-mode voltage switching. This paper presents a
   source-based commutation strategy along with a novel modulation
   technique resulting in 1) elimination of additional snubber circuits, 2)
   minimization of the frequency of leakage inductance commutation, 3)
   recovery of the leakage energy, and 4) soft switching of the output
   converter. The topology and its proposed control have been analyzed.

Abstract = {{The carbon nanotubes' resilience to mechanical deformation is a
   potentially important feature for imparting tunable properties at the
   nanoscale. Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics and empirical
   interatomic potentials, we examine the thermal conductivity variations
   with bending in the thermal transport regime where both ballistic and
   diffusive effects coexist. These simulations are enabled by the
   realistic atomic-scale descriptions of uniformly curved and buckled
   nanotube morphologies obtained by imposing objective boundary
   conditions. We uncover a contrasting behavior. At shorter lengths, the
   phonon propagation is affected significantly by the occurrence of
   localized structural buckling. As the nanotube length becomes comparable
   with the phonon mean free path, heat transport becomes insensitive to
   the buckling deformations. Our result settles the controversy around the
   differences between the current experimental and molecular-dynamics
   measurements of the thermal transport in bent nanotubes.}},

   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide to include electrochromism by adding
   an electrochromic (EC) redox molecule, methyl viologen. Ferrocene was
   also added to the EC gel as an anodic species. The EC gel was inserted
   between two indium-tin oxide-coated glass slides (or plastic sheets) to

   at room temperature, it can be coated onto plastic straightforwardly,

Title = {{Complementary Amplicon-Based Genomic Approaches for the Study of Fungal
   Communities in Humans}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies highlight the importance of intestinal fungal microbiota
   in the development of human disease. Infants, in particular, are an
   important population in which to study intestinal microbiomes because
   microbial community structure and dynamics during this formative window
   of life have the potential to influence host immunity and metabolism.
   When compared to bacteria, much less is known about the early
   development of human fungal communities, owing partly to their lower
   abundance and the relative lack of established molecular and taxonomic
   tools for their study. Herein, we describe the development, validation,
   and use of complementary amplicon-based genomic strategies to
   characterize infant fungal communities and provide quantitative
   information about Candida, an important fungal genus with respect to
   intestinal colonization and human disease. Fungal communities were
   characterized from 11 infant fecal samples using primers that target the
   internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 locus, a region that provides
   taxonomic discrimination of medically relevant fungi. Each sample
   yielded an average of 27,553 fungal sequences and Candida albicans was
   the most abundant species identified by sequencing and quantitative PCR
   (qPCR). Low numbers of Candida krusei and Candida parapsilosis sequences
   were observed in several samples, but their presence was detected by
   species-specific qPCR in only one sample, highlighting a challenge
   inherent in the study of low-abundance organisms. Overall, the
   sequencing results revealed that infant fecal samples had fungal
   diversity comparable to that of bacterial communities in similar-aged
   infants, which correlated with the relative abundance of C. albicans. We
   conclude that targeted sequencing of fungal ITS2 amplicons in
   conjunction with qPCR analyses of specific fungi provides an informative
   picture of fungal community structure in the human intestinal tract. Our
   data suggests that the infant intestine harbors diverse fungal species
   and is consistent with prior culture-based analyses showing that the
   predominant fungus in the infant intestine is C. albicans.}},

Title = {{The role of short term memory and conduction velocity restitution in
   alternans formation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{367}},
Pages = {{21-28}},
Month = {{FEB 21}},
Abstract = {{Alternans is the periodic beat-to-beat short-long alternation in action
   potential duration (APD), which is considered to be a precursor of
   ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. In extended cardiac
   tissue, electrical alternans can be either spatially concordant (SCA,
   all cells oscillate in phase) or spatially discordant (SDA, cells in
   different regions oscillate out of phase). SDA gives rise to an increase
   in the spatial dispersion of repolarization, which is thought to be
   proarrhythmic. In this paper, we investigated the effect of two aspects
   of short term memory (STM) (alpha, tau) and their interplay with
   conduction velocity (CV) restitution on alternans formation using
   numerical simulations of a mapping model with two beats of memory. Here,
   a quantifies the dependence of APD restitution on pacing history and tau
   characterizes APD accommodation, which is an exponential change of APD
   over time once basic cycle length (BCL) changes. Our main findings are
   as follows: In both single cell and spatially coupled homogeneous cable,
   the interplay between a and T affects the dynamical behaviors of the
   system. For the case of large APD accommodation (tau >= 290 ms),
   increase in alpha leads to suppression of alternans. However, if APD
   accommodation is small (tau <= 250 ms), increase in a leads to
   appearance of additional alternans region. On the other hand, the slope
   of CV restitution does not change the regions of alternans in the cable.
   However, steep CV restitution leads to more complicated dynamical
   behaviors of the system. Specifically, SDA instead of SCA are observed.
   In addition, for steep CV restitution and sufficiently large tau, we
   observed formations of type II conduction block (CB2), transition from
   type I conduction block (CB1) to CB2, and unstable nodes. (C) 2014

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 16}},
Abstract = {{Kambersky damping, representing the loss of magnetic energy from the
   electrons to the lattice through the spin orbit interaction, is
   calculated for L1(0) FePt, FePd, CoPt, and CoPd alloys versus chemical
   degree of order. When more substitutional defects exist in the alloys,
   damping is predicted to increase due to the increase of the spin-flip
   channels allowed by the broken symmetry. It is demonstrated that this
   corresponds to an enhanced density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level,
   owing to the rounding of the DOS with loss of long-range order. Both the
   damping and the DOS of the Co-based alloy are found to be less affected
   by the disorder. Pd-based alloys are predicted to have lower damping
   than Pt-based alloys, making them more suitable for high density
   spintronic applications. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{A comparison of electric power output of CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG) and
   brine geothermal systems for varying reservoir conditions}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Pages = {{365-377}},
Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{In contrast to conventional hydrothermal systems or enhanced geothermal
   systems, CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG) systems generate electricity by
   using CO2 that has been geothermally heated due to sequestration in a
   sedimentary basin. Four CPG and two brine-based geothermal systems are
   modeled to estimate their power production for sedimentary basin
   reservoir depths between 1 and 5 km, geothermal temperature gradients
   from 20 to 50 degrees C km(-1), reservoir permeabilities from 1 x
   10(-15) to 1 x 10(-12) m(2) and well casing inner diameters from 0.14 m
   to 0.41 m. Results show that CPG direct-type systems produce more
   electricity than brine-based geothermal systems at depths between 2 and
   3 km, and at permeabilities between 10(-14) and 10(-13) m(2), often by a
   factor of two. This better performance of CPG is due to the low
   kinematic viscosity of CO2, relative to brine at those depths, and the
   strong thermosiphon effect generated by CO2. When CO2 is used instead of
   R245fa as the secondary working fluid in an organic Rankine cycle (ORC),
   the power production of both the CPG and the brine-reservoir system
   increases substantially; for example, by 22\% and 20\% for subsurface
   brine and CO2 systems, respectively, with a 35 degrees C km(-1) thermal
   gradient, 0.27 m production and 0.41 m injection well diameters, and 5 x
   10(-14) m(2) reservoir permeability. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We obtained experimental extension data for barcoded E. coli genomic DNA
   molecules confined in nanochannels from 40 nm to 51 nm in width. The
   resulting data set consists of 1 627 779 measurements of the distance
   between fluorescent probes on 25 407 individual molecules. The
   probability density for the extension between labels is negatively
   skewed, and the magnitude of the skewness is relatively insensitive to
   the distance between labels. The two Odijk theories for DNA confinement
   bracket the mean extension and its variance, consistent with the scaling
   arguments underlying the theories. We also find that a harmonic
   approximation to the free energy, obtained directly from the probability
   density for the distance between barcode labels, leads to substantial
   quantitative error in the variance of the extension data. These results
   suggest that a theory for DNA confinement in such channels must account
   for the anharmonic nature of the free energy as a function of chain
   extension. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Dynamic simulation of sediment films of Yukawa-stabilized particles}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{The fast lubrication dynamics method is applied to simulate the motion
   and deposition of charge-stabilized 100-nm-diam particles into sediment
   films from aqueous dispersions. Colloidal interactions are incorporated
   with a Yukawa potential and the effects of the screened-Coulomb
   potential strength and Peclet number (which controls the sedimentation
   driving force) on particle orientation are quantified with a sixfold
   bond order parameter. The effect of sediment growth rate on the order
   parameter is determined and related to a competition between the
   electrostatic interaction strength and sedimentation driving force.
   Increasing the electrostatic interaction strength and decreasing the
   Peclet number lead to lower sediment growth rates and consequently

Abstract = {{Mixtures of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) and polystyrenesulfonate
   (PEDOT:PSS) have high electrical conductivity when cast from aqueous
   suspensions in combination with a high boiling-point cosolvent dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO). The electronic component of the thermal conductivity
   of these highly conducting polymers is of interest for evaluating their
   potential for thermoelectric cooling and power generation. We find,
   using time-domain thermoreflectance measurements of thermal conductivity
   along multiple directions of thick (>20 mu m) drop-cast PEDOT films,
   that the thermal conductivity can be highly anisotropic (Lambda(1)
   approximate to 1.0 W m(-1) K-1 and Lambda(1) approximate to 0.3 W m(-1)
   K-1 for the in-plane and through-plane directions, respectively) when
   the electrical conductivity in the in-plane direction is large (sigma
   approximate to 500 S cm(-1)). We relate the increase in thermal
   conductivity to the estimated electronic component of the thermal
   conductivity using the WiedemannFranz law, and find that our data are
   consistent with conventional Sommerfeld value of the Lorenz number. We
   use measurements of the elastic constants (C-11 approximate to 11 GPa
   and C-44 approximate to 17 GPa) of spin-cast PEDOT films and
   through-plane thermal conductivity (Lambda(1) approximate to 0.3 W m(-1)
   K-1) of drop-cast and spin-cast films to support our assumption that the
   phonon contribution to the thermal conductivity does not change
   significantly with DMSO composition.}},

Title = {{Universal Phenomenology of Symmetric Diblock Copolymers near the

Year = {{2015}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{819-839}},

Abstract = {{We present a simulation study of how properties of symmetric diblock
   copolymers depend on the invariant degree of polymerization (N) over
   bar, focusing on the vicinity of the orderdisorder transition (ODT).
   Results from several coarse-grained simulation models are combined to
   cover a range of (N) over bar similar or equal to 200-8000 that includes
   most of the experimentally relevant range. Results are presented for the
   free energy per chain, the value of Chi N-e at the ODT, the latent heat
   of transition, the layer spacing, the composition profile, and
   compression modulus in the ordered phase. Universality (i.e., model
   independence) is demonstrated by showing that equivalent results for all
   properties are obtained from corresponding thermodynamic states of
   different simulation models. Corresponding states of symmetric
   copolymers are states with equal values of the parameters XeN and (N)
   over bar, where X-e is an effective FloryHuggins interaction parameter
   and N is a degree of polymerization. The underlying universality becomes
   apparent, however, only if data are analyzed using an adequate estimate
   of X-e, which we obtain by fitting the structure factor in the
   disordered state to recent theoretical predictions. The results show
   that behavior near the ODT exhibits a different character at moderate
   and high values of (N) over bar, with a crossover near (N) over bar
   similar or equal to 10(4). Within the range (N) over bar similar or
   equal to 10(4) studied here, the ordered and disordered phases near the
   ODT both contain strongly segregated domains of nearly pure A and B, in
   contrast to the assumption of weak segregation underlying the
   FredricksonHelfand (FH) theory. In this regime, the FH theory is
   inaccurate and substantially underestimates the value of x(e)N at the
   ODT. Results for the highest values of (N) over bar studied here agree
   reasonably well with FH predictions, suggesting that the theory may be
   accurate for (N) over bar similar or equal to 10(4). Self-consistent
   field theory (SCFT) grossly underestimates (XeN)ODT for modest (N) over
   bar because it cannot describe strong correlations in the disordered
   phase. SCFT is found, however, to yield accurate predictions for several
   properties of the ordered lamellar phase.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Nanoscale corrugations are of great importance in determining the
   physical properties of two-dimensional crystals. However, the mechanical
   behavior of atomically thin films under strain is not fully understood.
   In this Letter, we show a layer-dependent mechanical response of
   molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) subject to atomistic-precision strain
   induced by 2H-bilayer island epitaxy. Dimensional crossover in the
   mechanical properties is evidenced by the formation of star-shaped
   nanoripple arrays in the first monolayer, while rippling instability is
   completely suppressed in the bilayer. Microscopic-level quantum
   mechanical simulations reveal that the nanoscale rippling is realized by
   the twisting of neighboring Mo-S bonds without modifying the chemical
   bond length, and thus invalidates the classical continuum mechanics. The
   formation of nanoripple arrays significantly changes the electronic and
   nanotribological properties of monolayer MoS2. Our results suggest that
   quantum mechanical behavior is not unique for sp(2) bonding hut general
   for atomic membranes under strain.}},

Abstract = {{Whether your interests lie in scientific arenas, the corporate world, or
   in government, you have certainly heard the praises of big data: Big
   data will give you new insights, allow you to become more efficient,
   and/or will solve your problems. While big data has had some outstanding
   successes, many are now beginning to see that it is not the Silver
   Bullet that it has been touted to be. Here our main concern is the
   overall impact of big data; the current manifestation of big data is
   constructing a Maginot Line in science in the 21st century. Big data is
   not ``lots of data{''} as a phenomena anymore; The big data paradigm is
   putting the spirit of the Maginot Line into lots of data. Big data
   overall is disconnecting researchers and science challenges. We propose
   No-Boundary Thinking (NBT), applying no-boundary thinking in problem
   defining to address science challenges.}},

   absorbers in an energy-cascade architecture. Here, this approach is
   combined with a hostguest donor layer architecture previously shown to
   optimize exciton transport for the fluorescent organic semiconductor
   boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) when diluted in an optically
   transparent host. In order to maximize the absorption efficiency,
   energy-cascade OPVs that utilize both photoactive host and guest donor
   materials are examined using the pairing of SubPc and boron
   subnaphthalocyanine chloride (SubNc), respectively. In a planar
   heterojunction architecture, excitons generated on the SubPc host
   rapidly energy transfer to the SubNc guest, where they may migrate
   toward the dissociating, donoracceptor interface. Overall, the
   incorporation of a photoactive host leads to a 13\% enhancement in the
   short-circuit current density and a 20\% enhancement in the power
   conversion efficiency relative to an optimized hostguest OPV combining
   SubNc with a nonabsorbing host. This work underscores the potential for
   further design refinements in planar heterojunction OPVs and
   demonstrates progress toward the effective separation of functionality
   between constituent OPV materials.}},

Abstract = {{We report a method to measure DNA hybridization potentiometrically in a
   manner conducive to portable or hand-held biosensors. An
   electrolyte-gated transistor (EGT) based on poly(3-hexylthiophene)
   (P3HT) and an ion-gel serves as a transducer for surface hybridization
   of DNA. The key aspect of the design is the use of a floating-gate
   electrode functionalized with ssDNA whose potential is determined by
   both capacitive coupling with a primary, addressable gate electrode and
   the presence of adsorbed molecules. When DNA is hybridized at the
   floating gate, it offsets the primary gate voltage felt by the P3HT
   semiconductor; the offset is directly measurable and quantitatively
   related to the number density of dsDNA molecules. The presented sensing
   strategy can be readily adapted to other biomolecules of interest and
   integrated into a microfluidic system for field applications of
   biosensors.}},

Abstract = {{Large-scale genonnic efforts to study human cancer, such as the cancer
   gene atlas (TCGA), have identified numerous cancer drivers in a wide
   variety of tumor types. However, there are limitations to this approach,
   the mutations and expression or copy number changes that are identified
   are not always clearly functionally relevant, and only annotated genes
   and genetic elements are thoroughly queried. The use of complimentary,
   nonbiased, functional approaches to identify drivers of cancer
   development and progression is ideal to maximize the rate at which
   cancer discoveries are achieved. One such approach that has been
   successful is the use of the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon-based
   mutagenesis system in mice. This system uses a conditionally expressed
   transposase and mutagenic transposon allele to target mutagenesis to
   somatic cells of a given tissue in mice to cause random mutations
   leading to tumor development. Analysis of tumors for transposon common
   insertion sites (CIS) identifies candidate cancer genes specific to that
   tumor type. While similar screens have been performed in mice with the
   PiggyBac (PB) transposon and viral approaches, we limit extensive
   discussion to SB. Here we discuss the basic structure of these screens,
   screens that have been performed, methods used to identify CIS.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Ischemic postconditioning (stutter CPR) and sevoflurane have
   been shown to mitigate the effects of reperfusion injury in cardiac
   tissue after 15 min of ventricular fibrillation (VF) cardiac arrest.
   Poloxamer 188 (P188) has also proven beneficial to neuronal and cardiac
   tissue during reperfusion injury in human and animal models. We
   hypothesized that the use of stutter CPR, sevoflurane, and P188 combined
   with standard advanced life support would improve post-resuscitation
   cardiac and neurologic function after prolonged VF arrest.
   Methods: Following 17 min of untreated VF, 20 pigs were randomized to
   Control treatment with active compression/decompression (ACD) CPR and
   impedance threshold device (ITD) (n = 8) or Bundle therapy with stutter
   ACD CPR + ITD + sevoflurane + P188 (n = 12). Epinephrine and
   post-resuscitation hypothermia were given in both groups per standard
   protocol. Animals that achieved return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)
   were evaluated with echocardiography, biomarkers, and a blinded
   neurologic assessment with a cerebral performance category score.
   Results: Bundle therapy improved hemodynamics during resuscitation,
   reduced need for epinephrine and repeated defibrillation, reduced
   biomarkers of cardiac injury and end-organ dysfunction, and increased
   left ventricular ejection fraction compared to Controls. Bundle therapy
   also improved rates of ROSC (100\% vs. 50\%), freedom from major adverse
   events (50\% vs. 0\% at 48 h), and neurologic function (42\% with mild
   or no neurologic deficit and 17\% achieving normal function at 48 h).
   Conclusions: Bundle therapy with a combination of stutter ACD CPR, ITD,
   sevoflurane, and P188 improved cardiac and neurologic function after 17
   min of untreated cardiac arrest in pigs.

Abstract = {{Nonlinear estimation problems, such as range-only and bearing-only
   target tracking, are often addressed using linearized estimators, e. g.,
   the extended Kalman filter (EKF). These estimators generally suffer from
   linearization errors as well as the inability to track multimodal
   probability density functions. In this paper, we propose a bank of batch
   maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimators as a general estimation framework
   that provides relinearization of the entire state trajectory,
   multihypothesis tracking, and an efficient hypothesis generation scheme.
   Each estimator in the bank is initialized using a locally optimal state
   estimate for the current time step. Every time a new measurement becomes
   available, we relax the original batch-MAP problem and solve it
   incrementally. More specifically, we convert the relaxed one-step-ahead
   cost function into polynomial or rational form and compute all the local
   minima analytically. These local minima generate highly probable
   hypotheses for the target's trajectory and hence greatly improve the
   quality of the overall MAP estimate. Additionally, pruning of least
   probable hypotheses and marginalization of old states are employed to
   control the computational cost. Monte Carlo simulation and real-world
   experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly
   outperforms the standard EKF, the batch-MAP estimator, and the particle
   filter.}},

Abstract = {{Graphs are an important tool for modeling data in many diverse domains.
   Recent increase in sensor technology and deployment, the adoption of
   online services, and the scale of VLSI circuits has caused the size of
   these graphs to skyrocket. Finding clusters of highly connected vertices
   within these graphs is a critical part of their analysis.
   In this paper we apply the multilevel paradigm to the modularity graph
   clustering problem. We improve upon the state of the art by introducing
   new efficient methods for coarsening graphs, creating initial
   clusterings, and performing local refinement on the resulting
   clusterings. We establish that for a graph with n vertices and m edges,
   these algorithms have an 0(m+n) runtime complexity and an 0(m+n) space
   complexity, and show that in practice they are extremely fast. We
   present shared-memory parallel formulations of these algorithms to take
   full advantage of modern architectures, which we show have a parallel
   runtime of 0(m/p+n/p+k), where p is the number of threads and k is the
   number of clusters. Finally, we present the product of this research,
   the clustering tool Nerstrand. In serial mode, Nerstrand runs in a
   fraction of the time of current methods and produces results of equal
   quality. When run in parallel mode, Nerstrand exhibits significant
   speedup with less than one percent degradation of clustering quality.
   Nerstrand works well on large graphs, clustering a graph with over 105
   million vertices and 3.3 billion edges in 90 s. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{Conventional gait labs are limited in their ability to study running
   gait due to their size. There is no consensus in the literature
   regarding the ability to extrapolate results for adult treadmill running
   to overground. This comparison has not been studied in children.
   Twenty-four healthy children (mean age 11.7) ran overground at a slow
   running speed while motion capture, ground reaction force, and surface
   electromyography (EMG) data were obtained. The same data were then
   collected while participants ran for 6 min on an instrumented treadmill
   at a speed similar to their overground speed. The kinematic, kinetic,
   and EMG data for overground and treadmill running were compared.
   Sagittal plane kinematics demonstrated similar hip and knee waveforms
   with the exception of more knee extension just before toe off. Ankle
   kinematic waveforms were similar during stance phase but treadmill
   running demonstrated decreased dorsiflexion during swing. Kinetic data
   was significantly different between the two conditions with treadmill
   running having a more anterior ground reaction force compared to
   overground. Due to the numerous differences between overground and
   treadmill gait demonstrated in this study, it is felt that the use of an
   instrumented treadmill is not a surrogate to the study of overground
   running in a pediatric population. This data set will function as a
   normative data set against which future treadmill studies can be
   compared. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the use of a control system to extend the life of
   a highway bridge. The safe life of a bridge can be more than tripled if
   the peak strain levels it experiences are reduced by just 33\%. As of
   2012, over 5000 bridges in the country have been deemed to be
   structurally deficient. Hence, the use of a vibration control system to
   extend the lives of bridges can be of tremendous societal impact. This
   paper utilizes a dynamic model of the Cedar Avenue tied arch steel
   bridge in Minnesota to investigate avenues for peak strain reduction.
   Simulations show that the use of passive structural modification devices
   such as stiffeners and dampers is inadequate to reduce the key resonant
   peaks in the frequency response of the bridge. Both active and
   semiactive vibration control strategies are then pursued. Active
   vibration control can effectively reduce all resonant peaks of interest,
   but is practically difficult to implement on a bridge due to power,
   size, and cost considerations. Semiactive control with a variable
   orifice damper in which the damping coefficient is changed in realtime
   using bridge vibration feedback can be practically implemented.
   Simulation results show that, when employed with multiple devices, the
   proposed semiactive control system can reduce the response at all
   critical resonant frequencies. Further analysis reveals that the
   location and number of actuators on the bridge is critical for
   controlling these specific resonant frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{The use of recycled materials in asphalt pavement is common practice as
   it yields economic benefits and reduced exploitation of natural
   resources. Over recent decades, many agencies in the USA have
   investigated the effect of adding reclaimed asphalt pavement on the
   field performance of asphalt mixtures used for pavement applications. In
   this work, the effect of reclaimed asphalt pavement on the
   low-temperature properties of hot mix asphalt was investigated using two
   tests: bending beam rheometer mixture creep, which is based on static
   loading, and dynamic shear rheometer mixture complex modulus, which uses
   oscillatory loading. Based on the experimental data, creep stiffness,
   m-value, thermal stress, critical cracking temperature and complex
   modulus were calculated, and then statistically and graphically
   evaluated. The results revealed that, at low temperature, most of the
   mixtures prepared with reclaimed asphalt pavement had poorer performance
   than a mixture prepared from virgin materials. However, no significant
   differences in creep and complex modulus properties were observed beyond
   a specific reclaimed asphalt pavement content, which is in the range of
   25-40\% depending on the stiffness of the binder used.}},

Abstract = {{A solar-assisted large-scale cleaning system (SALSCS) is proposed for
   air pollution abatement. The system consists of a large-scale flat-plate
   solar collector, a chimney, and a filter bank. In the basic
   configuration, an air flow is driven exclusively by buoyancy generated
   in the collector-chimney system, and PM2.5 and larger particulate matter
   is separated from the air in the filter bank. The proof of concept is
   obtained by means of a transient 3D numerical simulation of fluid and
   heat flow for a full-scale system, implemented in ANSYS Fluent and
   performed using high-performance computing techniques. The effects of
   the filter bank on the system performance including heat transfer and
   fluid flow characteristics are evaluated by studying two system
   configurations, without and with a filter bank, respectively. The
   proposed SALSCS system is predicted to be capable of processing
   atmospheric air at a flow rate of 2.64 x 10(5) m(3)/s, corresponding to
   the volume of 22.4 km(3) of polluted air remediated in 24 hours.}},

Abstract = {{A thermodynamic model of the ceria-based solar thermochemical redox
   cycle is presented with the objective of resolving the widely varying
   predictions of the solar-to-fuel efficiency possible with reduction
   carried out in a flow of inert sweep gas. The implications of the
   treatment of the gassolid interaction are explored through comparison of
   mixed flow and countercurrent flow configurations of reactants. The
   mixed flow model is applied for the first time to both reduction and
   oxidation reactions. The mechanical work to produce sweep gas of varying
   purity, separate the products, and pump gases is included. The results
   identify the conditions necessary for efficient operation. The two
   models lead to substantially different predictions of the usage of sweep
   gas and oxidizer and process efficiency. Efficiencies predicted with the
   conservative mixed flow model reach a maximum of 11\% for water
   splitting at 1073 K, assuming reduction at 1773 K, heat recovery of 80\%
   of the sensible heat of the gases, and an optimistic 75\% heat recovery
   of the sensible heat of the solid ceria. Without solid phase heat
   recovery, the maximum efficiency is 4\%. With the countercurrent model,
   the predicted solar-to-fuel efficiency reaches 41\% for water splitting
   at 1563 K without solid phase heat recovery. Though theoretically
   attractive, the countercurrent flow model predicts unattainable
   efficiencies due to the assumption of chemical equilibrium at both the
   inlet and outlet of the reduction and oxidation reactors and yields
   nonphysical results for oxidation temperatures less than 1563 K. Thus,
   we urge caution in drawing conclusions about the promise of metal oxide
   cycles on the basis of the countercurrent flow model. Nonetheless, it is
   reasonable to anticipate that the ceria cycle with inert-swept reduction
   and a temperature swing between reduction and oxidation may achieve
   commercially viable solar-to-fuel efficiencies, in between the
   predictions of the mixed and countercurrent models, through the careful
   design of reactors to provide gas and solid phase heat recovery and
   favorable gassolid flow configurations.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesThis study focused on how catheter size affects transseptal
   puncture, what transseptal indication means, and whether the swine model
   is predictive for humans.
   BackgroundTransseptal puncture is a common procedure that gains access
   to the left atrium, allowing percutaneous mitral valve repair, left
   atrial appendage closure, and left-sided ablations. The basic approach
   has not changed in many years; however, the frequency of transseptal
   punctures and the size of devices are increasing with emerging
   treatments.
   MethodsA broad range of devices (4F to 18 F) were advanced through
   atrial septa of swine hearts; some devices were inserted in both swine
   and human hearts using 10F catheters.
   ResultsGreater forces were required to puncture through the septa of
   human hearts compared to those of swine. Larger catheters used in swine
   hearts required greater force to advance them through the septa, causing
   greater dilation of tissue and sometimes tearing the floor of the fossa
   ovalis; analyses indicated an exponential increase in the size of the
   iatrogenic atrial septal defect. Specific tissue property testing of the
   septum primum showed that this tissue sheared at a lower exerted force
   in a superior to inferior direction.
   ConclusionsResults may provide physicians with important knowledge about
   what to expect when treating a possible iatrogenic atrial septal defect
   or help them understand the consequences of transseptal punctures.
   Comparative data between swine and human atrial septal tissue properties
   provide critical insights between the species and offer clinicians and
   device designers important information relative to differences in tissue
   behaviors. (J Interven Cardiol 2015;28:98-108)}},

Abstract = {{Rheological evidence of composition fluctuations in disordered diblock
   copolymers near the order disorder transition (ODT) has been documented
   in the literature over the past three decades, characterized by a
   failure of time temperature superposition (tTS) to reduce linear dynamic
   mechanical spectroscopy (DMS) data in the terminal viscoelastic regime
   to a temperature-independent form. However, for some materials, most
   notably poly(styrene-b-isoprene) (PS-PI), no signature of these
   rheological features has been found. We present small-angle X-ray
   scattering (SAXS) results on symmetric
   poly(cyclohexylethylene-b-ethylene) (PCHE-PE) diblock copolymers that
   confirm the presence of fluctuations in the disordered state and DMS
   measurements that also show no sign of the features ascribed to
   composition fluctuations. Assessment of DMS results published on five
   different diblock copolymer systems leads us to conclude that the
   effects of composition fluctuations can be masked by highly asymmetric
   block dynamics, thereby resolving a long-standing disagreement in the
   literature and reinforcing the importance of mechanical contrast in
   understanding the dynamics of ordered and disordered block polymers.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Titratable systems are common tools in metabolic engineering to tune the
   levels of enzymes and cellular components as part of pathway
   optimization. For nonmodel microorganisms with limited genetic tools,
   inducible sugar utilization pathways offer built-in titratable systems.
   However, these pathways can exhibit undesirable single cell behaviors
   that hamper the uniform and tunable control of gene expression. Here, we
   applied mathematical modeling and single cell measurements of
   L-arabinose utilization in Escherichia coli to systematically explore
   how sugar utilization pathways can be altered to achieve desirable
   inducible properties. We found that different pathway alterations, such
   as the removal of catabolism, constitutive expression of high affinity
   or low affinity transporters, or further deletion of the other
   transporters, came with trade-offs specific to each alteration. For
   instance, sugar catabolism improved the uniformity and linearity of the
   response at the cost of requiring higher sugar concentrations to induce
   the pathway. Within these alterations, we also found that a uniform and
   linear response could be achieved with a single alteration:
   constitutively expressing the high affinity transporter. Equivalent
   modifications to the D-xylose utilization pathway yielded similar
   responses, demonstrating the applicability of our observations. Overall,
   our findings indicate that there is no ideal set of typical alterations
   when co-opting natural utilization pathways for titratable control and
   suggest design rules for manipulating these pathways to advance basic
   genetic studies and the metabolic engineering of microorganisms for
   optimized chemical production.}},

Title = {{An immersogeometric variational framework for fluid-structure
   interaction: Application to bioprosthetic heart valves}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS IN APPLIED MECHANICS AND ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{284}},
Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a geometrically flexible technique for
   computational fluid-structure interaction (FSI). The motivating
   application is the simulation of tri-leaflet bioprosthetic heart valve
   function over the complete cardiac cycle. Due to the complex motion of
   the heart valve leaflets, the fluid domain undergoes large deformations,
   including changes of topology. The proposed method directly analyzes a
   spline-based surface representation of the structure by immersing it
   into a non-boundary-fitted discretization of the surrounding fluid
   domain. This places our method within an emerging class of computational
   techniques that aim to capture geometry on non-boundary-fitted analysis
   meshes. We introduce the term ``immersogeometric analysis{''} to
   identify this paradigm.
   The framework starts with an augmented Lagrangian formulation for FSI
   that enforces kinematic constraints with a combination of Lagrange
   multipliers and penalty forces. For immersed volumetric objects, we
   formally eliminate the multiplier field by substituting a
   fluid-structure interface traction, arriving at Nitsche's method for
   enforcing Dirichlet boundary conditions on object surfaces. For immersed
   thin shell structures modeled geometrically as surfaces, the tractions
   from opposite sides cancel due to the continuity of the background fluid
   solution space, leaving a penalty method. Application to a bioprosthetic
   heart valve, where there is a large pressure jump across the leaflets,
   reveals shortcomings of the penalty approach. To counteract steep
   pressure gradients through the structure without the conditioning
   problems that accompany strong penalty forces, we resurrect the Lagrange
   multiplier field. Further, since the fluid discretization is not
   tailored to the structure geometry, there is a significant error in the
   approximation of pressure discontinuities across the shell. This error
   becomes especially troublesome in residual-based stabilized methods for
   incompressible flow, leading to problematic compressibility at practical
   levels of refinement. We modify existing stabilized methods to improve
   performance.
   To evaluate the accuracy of the proposed methods, we test them on
   benchmark problems and compare the results with those of established
   boundary-fitted techniques. Finally, we simulate the coupling of the
   bioprosthetic heart valve and the surrounding blood flow under
   physiological conditions, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
   proposed techniques in practical computations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Biological conversion of carbon dioxide has been examined with growing

   The current work examines the pH sensitivity of the reaction catalyzed
   by isocitrate dehydrogenase with respect to its potentials in carbon
   capture and conversion via both experimental measurements and
   theoretical analysis. As a result, the reaction equilibrium constant
   determined experimentally shifted by a factor of approximate to 500-fold
   when pH changed between 5 and 9. Thermodynamic analysis agreed well with
   such a pH sensitivity, indicating the impact of pH on Gibbs free energy

Abstract = {{Competition for shared memory resources on multiprocessors is the
   dominant cause for slowing down applications and making their
   performance varies unpredictably. It exacerbates the need for Quality of
   Service (QoS) on such systems. In this paper, we propose a fair-progress
   process scheduling (FPS) policy to improve system fairness. The strategy
   is to force the equally-weighted applications to bear the same amount of
   slowdown when they run concurrently. When we find an application
   suffered more slowdown and accumulated less effective work than others,
   we allocate more CPU time to give it a better parity. This policy can
   also be applied to threads with different weights. Evaluation results
   show that FPS can significantly improve system fairness at the expense
   of a slight loss in throughput. We can also keep the performance
   information of an application to guide process scheduling when it runs
   again later on. When FPS uses such performance information from previous
   runs, fairness can be maintained without the overhead of the training
   periods required in FPS. Throughput can thus be enhanced.}},

Title = {{Size-Tuned ZnO Nanocrucible Arrays for Magnetic Nanodot Synthesis via

Abstract = {{Low-temperature atomic layer deposition of conformal ZnO on a
   self-assembled block polymer lithographic template comprising
   well-ordered, vertically aligned cylindrical pores within a
   poly(styrene) (PS) matrix was used to produce nanocrucible templates
   with pore diameters tunable via ZnO thickness. Starting from a PS
   template with a hexagonal array of 30 nm diameter pores on a 45 nm
   pitch, the ZnO thickness was progressively increased to narrow the pore
   diameter to as low as 14 nm. Upon removal of the PS by heat treatment in
   air at 500 degrees C to form an array of size-tunable ZnO nanocrucibles,
   permalloy (Ni80Fe20) was evaporated at normal incidence, filling the
   pores and creating an overlayer. Argon ion beam milling was then used to
   etch back the overlayer (a Damascene-type process), leaving a
   well-ordered array of isolated ZnO nanocrucibles filled with permalloy
   nanodots. Microscopy and temperature-dependent magnetometry verified the
   diameter reduction with increasing ZnO thickness. The largest diameter
   (30 nm) dots exhibit a ferromagnetic multidomain/vortex state at 300 K,
   with relatively weakly temperature-dependent coercivity. Reducing the
   diameter leads to a crossover to a single-domain state and eventually
   superparamagnetism at sufficiently high temperature, in quantitative
   agreement with expectations. We argue that this approach could render
   this form of block polymer lithography compatible with high-temperature
   processing (as required for technologically important high perpendicular
   anisotropy ordered alloys, for instance), in addition to enabling
   separation-dependent studies to probe interdot magnetostatic
   interactions}},

Title = {{Cognitive Transmit Beamforming From Binary CSIT}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{895-906}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Transmit beamforming is used to steer radiated power towards a receiver
   of interest and to limit interference to unintended receivers, thereby
   facilitating coexistence. Transmit beamforming requires accurate channel
   state information (CSI) at the transmitter, which is often difficult to
   acquire, particularly in cognitive underlay settings, where the primary
   receiver cannot be expected to cooperate with the secondary system to
   enable it to learn the secondary to primary crosstalk channel. This
   paper considers cases where it is not realistic to assume channel
   reciprocity, or that the receivers are capable of accurate CSI
   estimation and feedback-because they are legacy systems, or have limited
   computation/energy resources. Transmit beamforming from binary and
   infrequent CSI is first considered for an isolated link. An online
   beamforming and learning algorithm is developed using the analytic
   center cutting plane method and is shown to asymptotically attain
   optimal performance. A robust maximum-likelihood formulation is next
   developed to handle feedback errors and correlation drift. The setup is
   then generalized to a cognitive underlay setting, also exploiting the
   standard acknowledgement/negative-acknowledgement feedback on the
   reverse primary link. This is the first solution to jointly tackle
   secondary signal-to-noise ratio maximization and primary interference
   mitigation from only rudimentary CSI, without assuming channel
   reciprocity.}},

Title = {{Kinetics and Mechanism of Alcohol Dehydration on gamma-Al2O3: Effects of

Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Steady-state rates of ether formation from alcohols (1-propanol,
   2-propanol, and isobutanol) on gamma-Al2O3, at 488 K increase at low
   alcohol pressure (0.1-4.2 kPa) but asymptotically converge to different
   values, inversely proportional to water pressure, at high alcohol
   pressure (4.2-7.2 kPa). This observed inhibition of etherification rates
   for C-2-C-4 alcohols on gamma-Al2O3 by water is mechanistically
   explained by the inhibiting effect of surface trimers composed of two
   alcohol molecules and one water molecule. Unimolecular dehydration of
   C-3-C-4 alcohols follows the same mechanism as that for ethanol and
   involves inhibition by dimers. Deuterated alcohols show a primary
   kinetic isotope effect for unimolecular dehydration, implicating
   cleavage of a C-H bond (such as the C-beta-H bond) in the
   rate-determining step for olefin formation on gamma-Al2O3. Bimolecular
   dehydration does not show a kinetic isotope effect with deuterated
   alcohols, implying that C-O or Al-O bond cleavage is the
   rate-determining step for ether formation. The amount of adsorbed
   pyridine estimated by in situ titration to completely inhibit ether
   formation on gamma-Al2O3 shows that the number of sites available for
   bimolecular dehydration reactions is the same for different alcohols,
   irrespective of the carbon chain length and substitution. 2-Propanol has
   the highest rate constant for unimolecular dehydration among studied
   alcohols, demonstrating that stability of the carbocation-like
   transition state is the primary factor in determining rates of
   unimolecular dehydration which concomitantly results in high selectivity
   to the olefin. 1-Propanol and isobutanol have olefin formation rate
   constants higher than that of ethanol, indicating that olefin formation
   is also affected by carbon chain length. Isobutanol has the lowest rate
   constant for bimolecular dehydration because of steric factors. These
   results implicate the formation and importance of di- and trimeric
   species in low-temperature dehydration reactions of alcohols and
   demonstrate the critical role of substitution and carbon chain length in
   determining selectivity in parallel unimolecular and bimolecular
   dehydration reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Survivin is an important protein in regulating both cell apoptosis and
   proliferation. It has attracted growing attentions in recent years as a
   promising target for cancer therapy. Previous studies have revealed that
   monomeric survivin regulated apoptosis in a more significant way than
   the wild-type survivin that generally contains a large portion of its
   dimers. In order to investigate the roles of monomeric mutant survivin
   apoptosis and cell cycle regulation of human cancer cells, we developed
   and tested three dominant-negative mutants with multisite mutations
   (MSM) including TAT-survivin(34/101/102), TAT-survivin(34/117/101/102)
   and TAT-survivin(117/101/102). Results revealed that MSM mutants
   remained as monomers under ambient conditions, and induced cells (breast
   cancer Bcap-37 cells) apoptosis even more efficiently, primarily through
   the caspase-dependent and Bcl-2-related pathways, than non-monomeric
   mutants. We further identified that the TAT-survivin(34/101/102) and
   TAT-survivin(117/101/102) MSM significantly inhibited the proliferation
   of Bcap-37 cells and arrested cells in S and G(2)/M phases, while
   TAT-survivin(34/117/101/102) arrested cells in G(2)/M phase. It appeared
   to us that TAT-survivin(34/101/102) and TAT-survivin(117/101/102) also
   inhibited cell proliferation more significantly. These findings suggest
   that such MSM afford monomeric survivin with promising potentials for
   cancer therapy. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Most lysosomal storage disorders affect the nervous system as well as
   other tissues and organs of the body. Previously, the complexities of
   these diseases, particularly in treating neurologic abnormalities, were
   too great to surmount. However, based on recent developments there are
   realistic expectations that effective therapies are coming soon. Gene
   therapy offers the possibility of affordable, comprehensive treatment
   associated with these diseases currently not provided by standards of
   care. With a focus on correction of neurologic disease by systemic gene
   therapy of mucopolysaccharidoses types land IIIA, we review some of the
   major recent advances in viral and non-viral vectors, methods of their
   delivery and strategies leading to correction of both the nervous and
   somatic tissues as well as evaluation of functional correction of
   neurologic manifestations in animal models. We discuss two questions:
   what systemic gene therapy strategies work best for correction of both
   somatic and neurologic abnormalities in a lysosomal storage disorder and
   is there evidence that targeting peripheral tissues (e.g., in the liver)
   has a future for ameliorating neurologic disease in patients? (C) 2014

Abstract = {{While a host of methods exist to deliver genetic materials or small
   molecules to cells, very few are available for protein delivery to the
   cytosol. We describe a modular, light-activated nanocarrier that
   transports proteins into cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis and
   delivers the cargo to the cytosol by light triggered endosomal escape.
   The platform is based on hollow gold nanoshells (HGN) with polyhistidine
   tagged proteins attached through an avidity-enhanced, nickel chelation
   linking layer; here, we used green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a model
   deliverable cargo. Endosomal uptake of the GFP loaded nanocarrier was
   mediated by a C-end Rule (CendR) internalizing peptide fused to the GFP.
   Focused femtosecond pulsed-laser excitation triggered protein release
   from the nanocarrier and endosome disruption, and the released protein
   was capable of targeting the nucleoli, a model intracellular organelle.
   We further demonstrate the generality of the approach by loading and
   releasing Sox2 and p53. This method for targeting of individual cells,
   with resolution similar to microinjection, provides spatial and temporal
   control over protein delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic biology seeks to create new biological systems, including
   user-designed plants and plant cells. These systems can be employed for
   a variety of purposes, ranging from producing compounds of industrial or
   therapeutic value, to reducing crop losses by altering cellular
   responses to pathogens or climate change. To realize the full potential
   of plant synthetic biology, techniques are required that provide control
   over the genetic code - enabling targeted modifications to DNA sequences
   within living plant cells. Such control is now within reach owing to
   recent advances in the use of sequence-specific nucleases to precisely
   engineer genomes. We discuss here the enormous potential provided by

Title = {{Modeling of piston trajectory-based HCCI combustion enabled by a free

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{139}},
Pages = {{313-326}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Previously, the authors have designed and implemented an active motion
   control ``virtual crankshaft{''} for a free piston engine, which enables
   precise piston tracking of desired trajectories. With this mechanism,
   the volume of the combustion chamber can be regulated, and therefore the
   pressure, temperature and species concentrations of in-cylinder gas can
   be adjusted in real-time which affect the combustion process directly.
   This new degree of freedom enables us to conduct piston trajectory-based
   combustion control. In this paper, a model of the free piston engine
   running homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion under various
   piston trajectories is presented. The various piston trajectories have
   the ability to change the compression ratio and accommodate different
   piston motion patterns between the top dead center and the bottom dead
   center. Six reaction mechanisms are employed in the model in order to
   demonstrate the multi-fuel combustion ability of the free piston engine,
   and to describe the chemical kinetics of different fuels under various
   piston trajectories. Analysis of the simulation results is then
   presented which reveals the piston trajectory effects on the combustion
   in terms of in-cylinder gas temperature trace, indicated output work,
   heat loss and radical species accumulation process. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Genome engineering with designer nucleases is a rapidly progressing
   field, and the ability to correct human gene mutations in situ is highly
   desirable. We employed fibroblasts derived from a patient with Fanconi
   anemia as a model to test the ability of the clustered regularly
   interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 nuclease system to mediate
   gene correction. We show that the Cas9 nuclease and nickase each
   resulted in gene correction, but the nickase, because of its ability to
   preferentially mediate homology-directed repair, resulted in a higher
   frequency of corrected clonal isolates. To assess the off-target
   effects, we used both a predictive software platform to identify
   intragenic sequences of homology as well as a genome-wide screen
   utilizing linear amplification-mediated PCR. We observed no off-target
   activity and show RNA-guided endonuclease candidate sites that do not
   possess low sequence complexity function in a highly specific manner.
   Collectively, we provide proof of principle for precision genome editing
   in Fanconi anemia, a DNA repair-deficient human disorder.}},

Title = {{The mobilities of flame synthesized aggregates/agglomerates in the
   transition regime}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{45-57}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Mobility analysis is frequently used to evaluate the size distribution
   of nanoparticle aggregates synthesized in high temperature, gas phase
   environments, such as flames. Theoretically, the scalar mobilities of
   such non-spherical entities, whose characteristic sizes are similar to
   the mean free path of their background gas (lambda), are dependent on
   two size descriptors, the hydrodynamic radius (R-H) and the
   orientationally averaged projected area (PA) (as well as lambda).
   Unfortunately, the theoretical relationship linking the mobility to R-H
   and PA for aggregates has not been experimentally tested, and has often
   been discarded in lieu of simpler yet theoretically invalid expressions.
   Here, we examine the mobilities of flame synthesized titanium dioxide
   (TiO2) aggregates to directly test the link between the mobility, R-H,
   PA, and lambda. Flame synthesized aggregates with mobility equivalent
   diameters in air in the 45-80 nm range were classified with a
   differential mobility analyzer (DMA) and deposited on a transmission
   electron microscope (TEM) grid for subsequent imaging. Probable
   3-dimensional structures for each imaged aggregate were constructed,
   based on the assumption that aggregates were quasifractal in nature and
   by comparing four 2-dimensional size descriptors calculated for images
   to those of computationally generated projections of quasifractal
   aggregates (of prescribed pre-exponential factor, fractal dimension, and
   number of primary particles). The calculated mobilities for the
   3-dimensional structures inverted for each image are found to be in
   excellent agreement with their mobilities inferred from DMA
   classification, supporting the theoretically proposed relationship
   between the mobility and R-H, PA, and lambda in the Kn=pi lambda R-H/
   PA=1.27-4.11 range. Although a wide range of fractal dimensions and
   pre-exponential factors are inferred for the observed aggregates, the
   volumes of the reconstructed aggregates are still found to scale with
   the mobility diameters. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{WIND ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{339-349}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A field experiment was carried out to study the unsteady behavior of an
   instrumented full-scale 2.5MW wind turbine under neutral conditions. The
   analysis focused on the structure of the instantaneous turbine power and
   strain at its foundation. A meteorological tower located 1.6 rotor
   diameters upstream of the turbine was used to characterize the turbulent
   flow. Mean velocity and temperature were steady during the 1h period
   selected. The results suggest that the turbine power and foundation
   strain are modulated by atmospheric turbulence in a complex way. The
   spectral characteristics of both quantities exhibited three distinctive
   regions. Within the first region, defined by subrotor length scales, the
   turbine power was insensitive to the flow turbulence. In the
   intermediate region, with length scales up to those on the order of the
   atmospheric boundary layer thickness, the spectral contents of the power
   fluctuations phi(P) and flow phi(U) exhibit a non-linear relationship of
   the form phi(P)=G(f)phi(U), where G(f)(approximate to)f(-2) is a
   transfer/damping function. In the third region, dominated by the very
   large scales of motions, the power fluctuations are found to be directly
   influenced by the flow. The strain also showed three regions, similar to
   the power fluctuations. However, it follows the structure of the
   inertial subrange of the turbulence at subrotor scales. Intermittent
   gusts were able to induce intermittent behavior on the turbine power.
   Finally, the flow and power correlation showed that the velocity at the
   hub height is the best descriptor of the flow turbulence within the
   rotor area.Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The United States Food and Drug Administration and the Department of
   Agriculture jointly published the ``Guide to Minimize Microbial Food
   Safety Hazards for Fresh Fruits and Vegetables,{''} which is used as a
   basis for Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) audits. To understand
   barriers to incorporation of GAP by Minnesota vegetable farmers, a mail
   survey completed in 2008 was validated with visits to a subset of the
   farms. This was done to determine the extent to which actual practices
   matched perceived practices. Two hundred forty-six producers completed
   the mail survey, and 27 participated in the on-farm survey. Over 75\% of
   the on-farm survey respondents produced vegetables on 10 acres or less
   and had 10 or fewer employees. Of 14 questions, excellent agreement
   between on-farm interviews and mail survey responses was observed on two
   questions, four questions had poor or slight agreement, and eight
   questions had no agreement. Ninety-two percent of respondents by mail
   said ``they took measures to keep animals and pests out of packing and
   storage buildings.{''} However, with the on-site visit only 45\% met
   this requirement. Similarly, 81\% of respondents by mail said ``measures
   were taken to reduce the risk of wild and/or domestic animals entering
   into fruit and vegetable growing areas.{''} With direct observation,
   70\% of farms actually had taken measures to keep animals out of the
   growing areas. Additional, on-farm assessments were done regarding
   employee hygiene, training, presence of animals, water sources, and
   composting practices. This validation study demonstrated the challenge
   of creating nonleading and concise questions that are not open to broad
   interpretation from the respondents. If mail surveys are used to assess
   GAP, they should include open-ended questions and ranking systems to
   better assess farm practices. To provide the most accurate survey data
   for educational purposes or GAP audits, on-farm visits are recommended.}},

Abstract = {{In this manuscript, we present connectivity cluster analysis (CoCA), a
   novel computational framework that takes advantage of structure of the
   brain networks to magnify reproducible signals and quash noise. Resting
   state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data that is used in
   estimating functional brain networks is often noisy, leading to reduced
   power and inconsistent findings across independent studies. There is a
   need for techniques that can unearth signals in noisy datasets, while
   addressing redundancy in the functional connections that are used for
   testing association. CoCA is a data driven approach that addresses the
   problems of redundancy and noise by first finding groups of region pairs
   that behave in a cohesive way across the subjects. These cohesive sets
   of functional connections are further tested for association with the
   disease. CoCA is applied in the context of patients with schizophrenia,
   a disorder characterized as a disconnectivity syndrome. Our results
   suggest that CoCA can find reproducible sets of functional connections
   that behave cohesively. Applying this technique, we found that the
   connectivity clusters joining thalamus to parietal, temporal, and
   visuoparietal regions are highly discriminative of schizophrenia
   patients as well as reproducible using retest data and replicable in an
   independent confirmatory sample. Hum Brain Mapp 36:756-767, 2015. (c)

Abstract = {{We present a particular formulation of optimal transport for
   matrix-valued density functions. Our aim is to devise a geometry which
   is suitable for comparing power spectral densities of multivariable time
   series. More specifically, the value of a power spectral density at a
   given frequency, which in the matricial case encodes power as well as
   directionality, is thought of as a proxy for a ``matrix-valued mass
   density.{''} Optimal transport aims at establishing a natural metric in
   the space of such matrix-valued densities which takes into account
   differences between power across frequencies as well as misalignment of
   the corresponding principle axes. Thus, our transportation cost includes
   a cost of transference of power between frequencies together with a cost
   of rotating the principle directions of matrix densities. The two
   end-point matrix-valued densities can be thought of as marginals of a
   joint matrix-valued density on a tensor product space. This joint
   density, very much as in the classical Monge-Kantorovich setting, can be
   thought to specify the transportation plan. Contrary to the classical
   setting, the optimal transport plan for matrices is no longer supported
   on a thin zero-measure set.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel Hall-effect-based magnetic sensor for
   handheld measurement of either elasticity or tension in soft tissues. A
   theoretical model is developed for the mechanical interaction of the
   sensor with the tissue, and conditions are established under which the

   the magnetic field within the sensor is developed and a technique to
   estimate the sensor response in the presence of multiple magnets is
   established. This paper then provides analytical sensor responses and
   compares them with experimental results obtained on synthetic materials.
   It is found that the sensor can measure tension values upto 100 N with a
   resolution of 10 N in handheld operation and elasticity of upto 0.87 MPa
   with a resolution of 0.02 MPa. Significant experimental characterization
   and statistical analysis of sensor repeatability is performed. The
   viability of this sensor to make tension and elasticity measurements
   with biological tissues is then demonstrated using turkey tendons and
   fresh swine tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time ultrasound thermography has been recently demonstrated on
   commercially available diagnostic imaging probes. In vitro experimental
   results demonstrate high sensitivity to small, localized temperature
   changes induced by subtherapeutic focused ultrasound. Most of the
   published results, however, are based on a thermally induced echo strain
   model that assumes infinitesimal change in temperature between imaging
   frames. Under this assumption, the echo strain is computed using a
   low-pass axial differentiator, which is implemented by a finite-impulse
   response digital filter. In this paper, we introduce a new model for
   temperature estimation, which employs a recursive axial filter that acts
   as a spatial differentiator-integrator of echo shifts. The filter is
   derived from first principles and it accounts for a nonuniform
   temperature baseline, when computing the spatial temperature change
   between two frames. This is a major difference from the previously
   proposed infinitesimal echo strain filter (d-ESF) approach. We show that
   the new approach can be implemented by a first-order infinite-impulse
   response digital filter with depth-dependent spatial frequency response.
   Experimental results in vitro demonstrate the advantages over the d-ESF
   approach in terms of suppressing the spatial variations in the estimated
   temperature without resorting to ad hoc low-pass filtering of echo
   strains. The performance of the new recursive echo strain filter (RESF)
   is also illustrated using echo data obtained during subtherapeutic
   localized heating in the hind limb of Copenhagen rat in vivo. In
   addition to the RESF, we have used an adaptive spatial filter to remove
   motion and deformation artifacts during real-time data collection. The
   adaptive filtering algorithm is described and comparisons with
   uncompensated estimated spatio-temporal temperature profiles are given.
   The results demonstrate the feasibility of in vivo ultrasound
   thermography with high sensitivity and specificity.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new approach to noninvasively image the 3-D myocardial
   infarction (MI) substrates based on equivalent current density (ECD)
   distribution that is estimated from the body surface potential maps
   (BSPMs) during S-T segment. The MI substrates were identified using a
   predefined threshold of ECD. Computer simulations were performed to
   assess the performance with respect to: 1) MI locations; 2) MI sizes; 3)
   measurement noise; 4) numbers of BSPM electrodes; and 5) volume
   conductor modeling errors. A total of 114 sites of transmural
   infarctions, 91 sites of epicardial infarctions, and 36 sites of
   endocardial infarctions were simulated. The simulation results show
   that: 1) Under 205 electrodes and 10-mu V noise, the averaged accuracies
   of imaging transmural MI are 83.4\% for sensitivity, 82.2\% for
   specificity, 65.0\% for Dice's coefficient, and 6.5 mm for distances
   between the centers of gravity (DCG). 2) For epicardial infarction, the
   averaged imaging accuracies are 81.6\% for sensitivity, 75.8\% for
   specificity, 45.3\% for Dice's coefficient, and 7.5 mm for DCG; while
   for endocardial infarction, the imaging accuracies are 80.0\% for
   sensitivity, 77.0\% for specificity, 39.2\% for Dice's coefficient, and
   10.4 mm for DCG. 3) A reasonably good imaging performance was obtained
   under higher noise levels, fewer BSPM electrodes, and mild volume
   conductor modeling errors. The present results suggest that this method
   has the potential to aid in the clinical identification of the MI
   substrates.}},

Title = {{Optimal contact forces to minimize cardiac perforations before, during,

Journal = {{HEART RHYTHM}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Catheter perforations remain a major clinical concern during
   ablation procedures for treatment of atrial arrhythmias and may Lead to
   life-threatening cardiac tamponade. Radiofrequency (RE) ablation alters
   the biomechanical properties of cardiac tissue, ultimately allowing for
   perforation to occur more readily. Studies on the effects of
   cryoablation on perforation force as well as studies defining the
   perforation force of human tissue are Limited.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to investigate the required
   force to elicit perforation of cardiac atrial tissue after or during
   ablation procedures.
   METHODS Effects of RF or cryothermal ablations on catheter perforation
   forces for both swine (n = 83 animals, 530 treatments) and human (n = 8
   specimens, 136 treatments) cardiac tissue were investigated.
   RESULTS Overall average forces resulting in perforation of healthy
   unablated tissue were 406g +/- 170g for swine and 591g +/- 240g for
   humans. Post-RE ablation applications considerably reduced these forces
   to 246g +/- 118g for swine and 362 +/- 185g for humans (P < .001).
   Treatments with cryoablation did not significantly alter forces required
   to induce perforations. Decreasing catheter sizes resulted in a
   reduction in forces required to perforate the atrial wall (P < .001).
   Catheter perforations occurred over an array of contact forces with a
   minimum of 38g being observed.
   CONCLUSION The swine model Likely underestimates the required
   perforation forces relative to those of human tissues. We provide novel
   insights related to the comparative effects of RE and cryothermal
   ablations on the potential for inducing undesired punctures, with RE
   ablation reducing perforation force significantly. These data are
   insightful for physicians performing ablation procedures as well as for
   medical device designers.}},

Title = {{Health effects of fine particulate matter in life cycle impact
   assessment: findings from the Basel Guidance Workshop}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is considered to be one of the
   most important environmental factors contributing to the global human
   disease burden. However, due to the lack of broad consensus and
   harmonization in the life cycle assessment (LCA) community, there is no
   clear guidance on how to consistently include health effects from PM2.5
   exposure in LCA practice. As a consequence, different models are
   currently used to assess life cycle impacts for PM2.5, sometimes leading
   to inconsistent results. In a global effort initiated by the United
   Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)/Society for Environmental
   Toxicology and Chemistry (SETAC) Life Cycle Initiative, respiratory
   inorganics' impacts expressed as health effects from PM2.5 exposure were
   selected as one of the initial impact categories to undergo review with
   the goal of providing global guidance for implementation in life cycle
   impact assessment (LCIA). The goal of this paper is to summarize the
   current knowledge and practice for assessing health effects from PM2.5
   exposure and to provide recommendations for their consistent integration
   into LCIA.
   Methods A task force on human health impacts was convened to build the
   framework for consistently quantifying health effects from PM2.(5)
   exposure and for recommending PM2.5 characterization factors. In an
   initial Guidance Workshop, existing literature was reviewed and input
   from a broad range of internationally recognized experts was obtained
   and discussed. Workshop objectives were to identify the main scientific
   questions and challenges for quantifying health effects from PM2.5
   exposure and to provide initial guidance to the impact quantification
   process.
   Results and discussion A set of 10 recommendations was developed
   addressing (a) the general framework for assessing PM2.5-related health
   effects, (b) approaches and data to estimate human exposure to PM2.5
   using intake fractions, and (c) approaches and data to characterize
   exposure-response functions (ERFs) for PM2.5 and to quantify severity of
   the diseases attributed to PM2.5 exposure. Despite these advances, a
   number of complex issues, such as those related to nonlinearity of the
   ERF and the possible need to provide different ERFs for use in different
   geographical regions, require further analysis.
   Conclusions and outlook Questions of how to refine and improve the
   overall framework were analyzed. Data and models were proposed for
   harmonizing various elements of the health impact pathways for PM2.5.
   Within the next two years, our goal is to build a global guidance
   framework and to determine characterization factors that are more
   reliable for incorporating the health effects from exposure to PM2.5
   into LCIA. Ideally, this will allow quantification of the impacts of
   both indoor and outdoor exposures to PM2.5.}},

   concerns, yard motivations, perceived ability regarding fertilization
   practices). We use survey data from a sample of 942 residents within the
   Minneapolis/Saint Paul, Minnesota metropolitan area. Our results
   indicate that fertilization is not driven by one overriding factor but
   by a combination of factors. Specifically, we show significant effects
   from a range of structural aspects (lot size, location, use of a
   professional lawn service), sociodemographics (home value), norms
   (perceived neighbor effects), knowledge (perceived positive/negative
   aspects of fertilization), and perceived ability. We also explore the

Abstract = {{A metal-oxide broken-gap heterojunction between p-Cu2O and n-In2O3 is
   proposed and studied for use as a tunnel junction in polycrystalline
   CuIn1-xGaxSe2 (CIGS) based tandem solar cells using numerical device
   simulation. Specifically, a tandem solar cell with a CuGaSe2 (CGS)
   absorber top cell and a CuInSe2 (CIS) absorber bottom cell was
   considered. The ballistic transport model explains well the carrier
   transport in the broken-gap heterojunction. Broken-gap heterojunctions
   provide linear current-voltage characteristics even if one side is
   lightly doped and the junction resistance is much lower than typical
   values of series resistance in solar cells. However, electron affinities
   of metal oxides for broken-gap band alignment may induce an energy
   barrier between the tunnel junction and the top and bottom solar cells,
   degrading performance. These barriers can be reduced using buffer
   layers. For example, NiO and graded In2O3-ZnO buffer layers are proposed
   beneath CGS top solar cell and above the CIS bottom solar cell,
   respectively. With these buffer layers, the efficiencies of the top and
   bottom cells are 17.5\% and 6.5\% respectively. The modeled efficiency
   of the CGS/CIS tandem solar cell is 24.1\% and there is virtually no
   significant efficiency loss due to the presence of the broken-gap
   junction. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{404-414}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of solar thermochemical cycles to split water and carbon
   dioxide depends in large part on highly effective gas phase heat
   recovery. To accomplish this goal, we present the design and analysis of
   the thermal and hydrodynamic performance of a counter-flow, tube-in-tube
   alumina heat exchanger operating at temperatures of 1500 degrees C and
   integrated with a solar thermochemical reactor for isothermal production
   of syngas via the ceria redox cycle. The heat exchanger tubes are filled
   with alumina reticulated ceramic to enhance heat transfer. The effects
   of foam morphology and heat exchanger size on heat transfer, pressure
   drop, and process solar-to-fuel efficiency are explored by coupling a
   computational fluid dynamic model of the heat exchanger, including
   radiative transport, with the overall reactor energy balance. We examine
   foam pore densities of 10, 20 and 30 PPI, and porosities of 65-90\%. The
   10 PPI foam yields the best heat transfer performance and lowest
   pressure drop, as the larger pores enhance radiative heat transfer and
   decrease fluid phase drag forces. Although lower porosity is preferred
   to improve solid phase conduction in the RPC, the tradeoff in heat
   transfer and pressure drop point to use of higher porosity foam.
   Optimization for solar-to-fuel reactor efficiency is achieved with
   85-90\% porosity, 10 PPI RPC. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Turbulent flow and heat transfer enhancement in rectangular channels
   with novel cylindrical grooves}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{81}},
Pages = {{563-577}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Turbulent flow characteristics and heat transfer performances in square
   channels with different cylindrical-shaped grooves are analyzed and
   compared numerically in this research. The novel groove geometries are
   conventional cylindrical grooves with rounded transitions to the
   adjacent flat surfaces and with modifications to their bases. The
   objective of this work is to determine optimal configuration for
   augmenting heat transfer rates with minimal pressure drop penalties. The
   paper documents also provide the flow details near the groove surface.
   All turbulent fluid flow and heat transfer results are obtained using
   computation fluid dynamics with a verified v(2)f turbulence closure
   model. Five rectangular channels with different cylindrical groove
   shapes are computed. Heat transfer enhancement and flow details are
   analyzed and compared with results for conventional cylindrical groove
   geometry and for conventional square ribs. This investigation shows that
   the conventional cylindrical grooves have similar overall heat transfer
   enhancement with conventional square ribs, but the pressure loss penalty
   is much decreased from square rib values. The rounded transition of the
   grooves has a large advantage over conventional cylindrical grooved
   surfaces in both enhancing heat transfer and reducing pressure loss
   penalty. For the rounded-transition grooves, recirculating flows inside
   the groove are reduced and reattachment develops more smoothly and the
   separating zone is reduced compared with the flow over the conventional
   cylindrical groove. The velocity magnitude in the near-wall region of
   grooved surface is much larger compared with that over a ribbed surface,
   which essentially causes the larger heat transfer enhancement for the
   groove surfaces. The design for the rounded transitions is shown to
   improve the overall thermal performance for channel internal cooling.

   insights into their role in potentially causing or promoting obesity.
   The human gut is home to trillions of microbes, among which hundreds of
   distinct species of bacteria interact to form the human gut microbiome,
   and numerous studies in humans and animal models have linked shifts in
   the gut microbiome to obesity. In this review we explore contemporary
   understandings of the relationship between obesity and the microbiome
   from a high-level ecological and functional perspective, along with a
   survey of recently proposed interventions. We highlight areas of

Abstract = {{A wide band gap semiconducting form of graphene can be produced by
   growing a buckled form of graphene from a SiC(000 (1) over bar) surface
   randomly seeded with nitrogen. In this work, we show that the disorder
   observed in this form of graphene can be substantially reduced by
   pre-patterning the nitrogen seeded SiC surface into trenches. The result
   of the patterning is highly improved film thickness variations,
   orientational epitaxy, domain size, and electronic structure. The
   ordering induced by this patterned growth offers a way to take advantage
   of the extremely high mobilities and switching speeds in C-face graphene
   devices while having the thickness uniformity and fabrication
   scalability normally only achievable for graphene grown on the SiC(0001)

Abstract = {{Measurements of the hygroscopic response of aerosol and the
   particle-to-gas partitioning of semivolatile organic compounds are
   crucial for providing more accurate descriptions of the compositional
   and size distributions of atmospheric aerosol. Concurrent measurements
   of particle size and composition (inferred from refractive index) are
   reported here using optical tweezers to isolate and probe individual
   aerosol droplets over extended timeframes. The measurements are shown to
   allow accurate retrievals of component vapor pressures and hygroscopic
   response through examining correlated variations in size and composition
   for binary droplets containing water and a single organic component.
   Measurements are reported for a homologous series of dicarboxylic acids,
   maleic acid, citric acid, glycerol, or 1,2,6-hexanetriol. An assessment
   of the inherent uncertainties in such measurements when measuring only
   particle size is provided to confirm the value of such a correlational
   approach. We also show that the method of molar refraction provides an
   accurate characterization of the compositional dependence of the
   refractive index of the solutions. In this method, the density of the
   pure liquid solute is the largest uncertainty and must be either known
   or inferred from subsaturated measurements with an error of <+/- 2.5\%
   to discriminate between different thermodynamic treatments.}},

   inkjet-printed into the reservoirs and wicked into the channels by
   capillary forces. These features serve as a seed layer for copper
   deposition inside the channels via electroless plating. Highly
   conductive wires (>50\% bulk metal) with minimum line width and spacing
   of 2 and 4 mu m, respectively, and an aspect ratio of 0.6 are obtained.
   The embedded wires exhibit good mechanical flexibility, with minimal
   degradation in electrical performance after thousands of bending cycles.}},

Abstract = {{The toughening effects of graphene and graphene-derived materials on
   thermosetting epoxies are investigated. Graphene materials with various
   structures and surface functional groups are incorporated into an epoxy
   resin by in situ polymerization. Graphene oxide (GO) and GO modified
   with amine-terminated poly(butadiene-acrylonitrile) (ATBN) are chosen to
   improve the dispersion of graphene nanosheets in epoxy and increase
   their interfacial adhesion. An impressive toughening effect is observed
   with less than 0.1 wt\% graphene. A maximum in toughness at loadings as
   small as 0.02 wt\% or 0.04 wt\% is observed for all four types of
   graphene studied. An epoxy nanocomposite with ATBN-modified GO shows a
   1.5-fold improvement in fracture toughness and a corresponding 2.4-fold
   improvement in fracture energy at 0.04 wt\% of graphene loading. At such
   low loadings, these graphene-type materials become economically feasible
   components of nanocomposites. A microcrack mechanism is proposed based
   on microscopy of the fracture surfaces. Due to the stress concentration
   by graphene nanosheets, microcracks may be formed to absorb the fracture
   energy. However, above a certain graphene concentration, the coalescence
   of microcracks appears to facilitate crack propagation, lowering the
   fracture toughness. Crack deflection and pinning likely contribute to
   the slow increase in fracture toughness at higher loadings.}},

Abstract = {{Three developments are presented that significantly expand the
   applicability of dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) simulations for
   symmetric and non-symmetric mixtures, where the former contain particles
   with equal repulsive parameter for self-interactions but a different
   repulsive parameter for cross-interactions, and the latter contain
   particles with different repulsive parameters also for the
   self-interactions. Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations for
   unary phases covering a wide range of repulsive parameters and of
   densities for single-bead DPD particles point to deficiencies of the
   Groot and Warren equation of state (GW-EOS) {[}J. Chem. Phys. 107, 4423
   (1997)]. A revised version, called rGW-EOS, is proposed here that is
   significantly more accurate over a wider range of parameters/densities.
   The second development is the generalization of the relationship between
   the Flory-Huggins. parameter and the repulsive cross-interaction
   parameter when the two particles involved have different molecular
   volumes. The third aspect is an investigation of Gibbs ensemble Monte
   Carlo simulation protocols, which demonstrates the importance of volume
   fluctuations and excess volumes of mixing even for equimolar symmetric
   mixtures of DPD particles. As an illustrative example, the novel DPD
   methodology is applied to the prediction of the liquid-liquid equilibria
   for acetic anhydride/(n-hexane or n-octane) binary mixtures. (C) 2015

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{While well-defined high quality semiconductor nanocrystals have been
   synthesized successfully in low pressure nonthermal plasmas, moving the
   field of plasma nanoparticle synthesis to atmospheric pressures is
   important for lowering its cost and making the process attractive for
   some industrial applications. Here we present a heating and charging
   model for silicon nanoparticles during their synthesis in plasmas
   maintained over a wide range of pressures (10 - 10(5) Pa). We consider
   three collisionality regimes and determine the dominant contribution of
   each regime to heating and charging of nanoparticles under various
   plasma conditions. For plasmas maintained at atmospheric pressures we
   find that the ion current is mainly due to the collisional hydrodynamic
   contribution. Based on the model, we predict that the formation of
   nanocrystals at atmospheric pressure requires significantly higher
   plasma densities than those at low pressures. Strong nanoparticle
   cooling at atmospheric pressures necessitates high ion densities to
   reach temperatures required for crystallization of nanoparticles. Using
   experimentally determined plasma properties from the literature we
   estimate the nanoparticle temperature that can be achieved during
   synthesis at atmospheric pressures and predict that temperatures well
   above those required for crystallization can be achieved. Based on these
   results we suggest design principles for nanocrystal synthesis at
   atmospheric pressures.}},

Volume = {{282}},

Abstract = {{Isoflavones are compounds whose presence in the aquatic environment is
   increasingly recognized and may be of concern due to their potential to
   act as endocrine disruptors. Sorption to particles may be a relevant
   removal mechanism for isoflavones. This work investigated the influence
   of pH, ionic strength, and sediment composition on sorption of genistein
   and daidzein, two key isoflavones, using sorption isotherms and edges.
   The effect of sorbed isoflavones on the survival, growth, and predator
   avoidance performance of larval fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas)
   was assessed. Sorption to goethite and kaolinite was pH-dependent, with
   a maximum near pH 7 for both compounds. Sorption to montmorillonite was
   ionic-strength dependent but largely pH-independent. Overall, sorption
   to sediments is likely to sequester less than 5\% of isoflavones in a
   discharge. No statistically significant effects were observed for larvae
   exposed to sorbed isoflavones, suggesting that sorption to sediments
   reduces exposure to isoflavones. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{SubPatCNV: approximate subspace pattern mining for mapping copy-number
   variations}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JAN 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Many DNA copy-number variations (CNVs) are known to lead to
   phenotypic variations and pathogenesis. While CNVs are often only common
   in a small number of samples in the studied population or patient
   cohort, previous work has not focused on customized identification of
   CNV regions that only exhibit in subsets of samples with advanced data
   mining techniques to reliably answer questions such as ``Which are all
   the chromosomal fragments showing nearly identical deletions or
   insertions in more than 30\% of the individuals?{''}.
   Results: We introduce a tool for mining CNV subspace patterns, namely
   SubPatCNV, which is capable of identifying all aberrant CNV regions
   specific to arbitrary sample subsets larger than a support threshold. By
   design, SubPatCNV is the implementation of a variation of approximate
   association pattern mining algorithm under a spatial constraint on the
   positional CNV probe features. In benchmark test, SubPatCNV was applied
   to identify population specific germline CNVs from four populations of
   HapMap samples. In experiments on the TCGA ovarian cancer dataset,
   SubPatCNV discovered many large aberrant CNV events in patient
   subgroups, and reported regions enriched with cancer relevant genes. In
   both HapMap data and TCGA data, it was observed that SubPatCNV employs
   approximate pattern mining to more effectively identify CNV subspace
   patterns that are consistent within a subgroup from high-density array
   data.
   Conclusions: SubPatCNV available through
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/subpatcnv/ is a unique scalable
   open-source software tool that provides the flexibility of identifying
   CNV regions specific to sample subgroups of different sizes from
   high-density CNV array data.}},

Abstract = {{Natural and synthetic anion receptors are extensively employed, but the
   structures of their bound complexes are difficult to determine in the
   liquid phase. Infrared spectroscopy is used in this work to characterize
   the solution structures of bound anion receptors for the first time, and
   surprisingly only two of three hydroxyl groups of the neutral aliphatic
   triols are found to directly interact with Cl. The binding constants of
   these triols with zero to three CF3 groups were measured in a polar
   environment, and K-CD3CN(Cl-) = 1.1 x 10(6) M-1 for the
   tris(trifluoromethyl) derivative. This is a remarkably large value, and
   high selectivity with respect to interfering anions such as, Br-, NO3
   and NCS- is also displayed. The effects of the third noninteracting
   hydroxyl groups on the structures and binding constants were also
   explored, and surprisingly they are as large or larger than the OH
   substituents that hydrogen bond to Cl. That is, a remote hydroxyl group
   can play a larger role in binding than two OH substituents that directly
   interact with an anionic center.}},

Abstract = {{This study demonstrates a method for producing ordered collagen fibrils
   on a similar length scale to those in the cornea, using a one-pot
   liquid-phase synthesis. The alignment persists throughout samples on the
   mm scale. The addition of nanocrystalline cellulose (NCC), a
   biocompatible and widely available material, to collagen prior to
   gelation causes the fibrils to align and achieve a narrow size
   distribution (36 +/- 8 nm). The effects of NCC loading in the composites
   on microstructure, transparency and biocompatibility are studied by
   scanning electron microscopy, ultraviolet visible spectroscopy and cell
   growth experiments. A 2\% loading of NCC increases the transparency of
   collagen while producing an ordered microstructure. A mechanism is
   proposed for the ordering behavior on the basis of enhanced hydrogen
   bonding during collagen gel formation. (C) 2014 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Noninvasive cardiac activation imaging of ventricular tachycardia (VT)
   is important in the clinical diagnosis and treatment of arrhythmias in
   heart failure (HF) patients. This study investigated the ability of the
   three-dimensional cardiac electrical imaging (3DCEI) technique for
   characterizing the activation patterns of spontaneously occurring and
   norepinephrine (NE)-induced VTs in a newly developed arrhythmogenic
   canine model of nonischemic HF. HF was induced by aortic insufficiency
   followed by aortic constriction in three canines. Up to 128 body-surface
   ECGs were measured simultaneously with bipolar recordings from up to 232
   intramural sites in a closed-chest condition. Data analysis was
   performed on the spontaneously occurring VTs (n = 4) and the NE-induced
   nonsustained VTs (n = 8) in HF canines. Both spontaneously occurring and
   NE-induced nonsustained VTs initiated by a focal mechanism primarily
   from the subendocardium, but occasionally from the subepicardium of left
   ventricle. Most focal initiation sites were located at apex, right
   ventricular outflow tract, and left lateral wall. The NE-induced VTs
   were longer, more rapid, and had more focal sites than the spontaneously
   occurring VTs. Good correlation was obtained between imaged activation
   sequence and direct measurements (averaged correlation coefficient of

Title = {{Pattern-Coupled Sparse Bayesian Learning for Recovery of Block-Sparse

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of recovering block-sparse signals whose cluster
   patterns are unknown a priori. Block-sparse signals with nonzero
   coefficients occurring in clusters arise naturally in many practical
   scenarios. However, the knowledge of the block partition is usually
   unavailable in practice. In this paper, we develop a new sparse Bayesian
   learning method for recovery of block-sparse signals with unknown
   cluster patterns. A pattern-coupled hierarchical Gaussian prior is
   introduced to characterize the pattern dependencies among neighboring
   coefficients, where a set of hyperparameters are employed to control the
   sparsity of signal coefficients. The proposed hierarchical model is
   similar to that for the conventional sparse Bayesian learning. However,
   unlike the conventional sparse Bayesian learning framework in which each
   individual hyperparameter is associated independently with each
   coefficient, in this paper, the prior for each coefficient not only
   involves its own hyperparameter, but also its immediate neighbor
   hyperparameters. In doing this way, the sparsity patterns of neighboring
   coefficients are related to each other and the hierarchical model has
   the potential to encourage structured-sparse solutions. The
   hyperparameters are learned by maximizing their posterior probability.
   We exploit an expectation-maximization (EM) formulation to develop an
   iterative algorithm that treats the signal as hidden variables and
   iteratively maximizes a lower bound on the posterior probability. In the
   M-step, a simple suboptimal solution is employed to replace a
   gradient-based search to maximize the lower bound. Numerical results are
   provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically explore signatures of plasmonic Fano interferences in a
   subwavelength plasmonic metamolecule consisting of closely packed
   asymmetric gold nanodimers, which lead to the possibility of generating
   multiple Fano resonances in the scattering spectrum. This spectral
   feature is attributed to the interference between bright and dark
   plasmonic modes sustained by the constituent nanodimers. The excited
   Fano dips are highly sensitive in both wavelength and amplitude to
   geometry and background dielectric medium. The tunability of induced
   Fano resonances associated with enhanced electric fields from the
   visible to infrared region provides promising applications, particularly
   in refractive index sensing, light-trapping, and photon up-converting.

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{48}},

Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates the flow dynamics of a radio-frequency (RF)
   non-equilibrium argon atmospheric pressure plasma jet. The RF power is
   at a frequency of 50 Hz or 20 kHz. Combined flow pattern visualizations
   (obtained by shadowgraphy) and gas temperature distributions (obtained
   by Rayleigh scattering) are used to study the formation of transient
   vortex structures in initial flow field shortly after the plasma is
   switched on and off in the case of 50 Hz modulation. The transient
   vortex structures correlate well with observed temperature differences.
   Experimental results of the fast modulated (20 kHz) plasma jet that does
   not induce changes of the gas temperature are also presented. The latter
   result suggests that momentum transfer by ions does not have dominant
   effect on the flow pattern close to the tube. It is argued that the
   increased gas temperature and corresponding gas velocity increase at the
   tube exit due to the plasma heating increases the admixing of
   surrounding air and reduces the effective potential core length. With
   increasing plasma power a reduction of the effective potential core
   length is observed with a minimum length for 5.6 W after which the
   length extends again. Possible mechanisms related to viscosity effects
   and ionic momentum transfer are discussed.}},

   representing nanotubes as bonded cylinder segments undergoing van der

   simulate how cross-linking transforms a soft bundle into a strong one.
   We predict that the sp(3)-sp cross-links formed by interstitial carbon
   atoms can improve the tensile strength by an order of magnitude, in
   agreement with experiment and molecular dynamics simulations. The DEM
   methodology allows performing the multiscale simulation needed for

Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a new allotrope of iron by first principles
   calculations. This phase has Pmn2(1) symmetry, a six-atom unit cell
   (hence the name Fe-6), and the highest magnetization density (M-s) among
   all the known crystalline phases of iron. Obtained from the structural
   optimizations of the Fe3C-cementite crystal upon carbon removal, Pmn2(1)
   Fe-6 is shown to result from the stabilization of a ferromagnetic FCC
   phase, further strained along the Bain path. Although metastable from 0
   to 50 GPa, the new phase is more stable at low pressures than the other
   well-known HCP and FCC allotropes and smoothly transforms into the FCC
   phase under compression. If stabilized to room temperature, for example,
   by interstitial impurities, Fe-6 could become the basis material for
   high M-s rare-earth-free permament magnets and high-impact applications
   such as light-weight electric engine rotors or high-density recording
   media. The new phase could also be key to explaining the enigmatic high

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Modeling agile and versatile spatial behavior remains a challenging
   task, due to the intricate coupling of planning, control, and perceptual
   processes. Previous results have shown that humans plan and organize
   their guidance behavior by exploiting patterns in the interactions
   between agent or organism and the environment. These patterns, described
   under the concept of Interaction Patterns (IPs), capture invariants
   arising from equivalences and symmetries in the interaction with the
   environment, as well as effects arising from intrinsic properties of
   human control and guidance processes, such as perceptual guidance
   mechanisms. The paper takes a systems' perspective, considering the IP
   as a unit of organization, and builds on its properties to present a
   hierarchical model that delineates the planning, control, and perceptual
   processes and their integration. The model's planning process is further
   elaborated by showing that the IP can be abstracted, using spatial
   time-to-go functions. The perceptual processes are elaborated from the
   hierarchical model. The paper provides experimental support for the
   model's ability to predict the spatial organization of behavior and the
   perceptual processes.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the phase transfer of polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide)
   (PS-PEO) polymersomes from a hydrophobic ionic liquid,
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
   ({[}EMIM]{[}TFSI]), into water. The dependence of the phase transfer on
   the molecular weight and PEO volume fraction (f(PEO)) of the PS-PEO
   polymersomes was systematically studied by varying the molecular weight
   of PS (10 000-27 000 g/mol) as well as by varying the volume fraction of
   PEO (f(PEO)) between 0.1 and 0.3. We demonstrate a general boundary for
   the phase transfer in terms of a reduced tethering density for PEO
   (sigma(PEO)), which is independent of the molecular weight of the
   hydrophobic PS. The reduced PEO tethering density was controlled by
   changing the polymersome size (i.e., increased polymersome sizes
   increase sigma(PEO)), confirming that it is the driving force in the
   transfer of PS-PEO polymersomes at room temperature. The phase transfer
   dependence on sigma(PEO) was also analyzed in terms of the free energy
   of polymersomes in the biphasic system. The quality of the aqueous
   phase, which affects the interfacial tension of the PS membrane,
   influenced the phase transfer. We systematically reduced the interfacial
   tension by adding a water-selective solvent, THF, which has a similar
   effect to increasing sigma(PEO). The results indicate that the
   interfacial tension between the membrane and water plays an important
   role in the phase transfer with the corona and that the phase transfer
   can be controlled either by the dimensions of the polymersomes or by the
   suitability of the solvent for the membrane. The interfacial
   tension-hindered phase transfer of polymersomes in the biphasic
   water-{[}EMIM]{[}TFSI] system will inform the design of
   temperature-sensitive and reversible nanoreactors and the separation of
   polydisperse particles according to size by tuning the quality of the

Abstract = {{When a granular material is impacted by a sphere, its surface deforms
   like a liquid yet it preserves a circular crater like a solid. Although
   the mechanism of granular impact cratering by solid spheres is well
   explored, our knowledge on granular impact cratering by liquid drops is
   still very limited. Here, by combining high-speed photography with
   high-precision laser profilometry, we investigate liquid-drop impact
   dynamics on granular surface and monitor the morphology of resulting
   impact craters. Surprisingly, we find that despite the enormous energy
   and length difference, granular impact cratering by liquid drops follows
   the same energy scaling and reproduces the same crater morphology as
   that of asteroid impact craters. Inspired by this similarity, we
   integrate the physical insight from planetary sciences, the liquid
   marble model from fluid mechanics, and the concept of jamming transition
   from granular physics into a simple theoretical framework that
   quantitatively describes all of the main features of liquid-drop
   imprints in granular media. Our study sheds light on the mechanisms
   governing raindrop impacts on granular surfaces and reveals a remarkable
   analogy between familiar phenomena of raining and catastrophic asteroid
   strikes.}},

   high bandwidth dynamic mode imaging scheme. The fidelity images define
   channels that allow the user to have additional authority over the
   choice of decision threshold that facilitates where the emphasis is
   desired, on discovering most true features on the sample with the
   possible detection of high number of false features, or emphasizing
   minimizing instances of false detections. Simulation and experimental

Abstract = {{Recent research in the USA has focused on the design, construction and
   performance of composite concrete pavements - that is, two heterogeneous
   concrete layers placed sequentially using `wet-on-wet' techniques. In
   addition, other research into rehabilitation practices has focused on
   improving the design and analysis of bonded concrete overlays of
   concrete pavements and bridge decks. While these techniques can offer
   many benefits to pavements and bridges, they also introduce some
   uncertainties, including the possibility of thermally, hygrally, or
   mechanically induced fracture and separation at the interface of the
   concrete layers. In this work, the potential for mixed-mode fracture at
   the interface between concrete layers is evaluated using
   three-dimensional lattice models. This discrete approach is coupled with
   a finite element model for plate behaviour away from the potential
   cracking zone. The model, using two damage criteria, was verified and
   validated against experimental data for failure in notched concrete
   beams in three-point testing. In addition, simulations were conducted
   using each criterion for interface failure in a composite concrete
   pavement. The simulation results suggest that interface fracture is
   unlikely, even when considering unfavourable conditions such as
   substandard material properties and large temperature differences
   between the pavement layers.}},

Abstract = {{Online social networks (OSNs) are becoming increasingly popular and are
   generating great interest in the study of the influence diffusion and
   influence maximization with applications to online viral marketing.
   Existing studies focus on social networks with only friendship
   relations, whereas the foe or enemy relations that commonly exist in
   many OSNs, e.g., Epinions and Slashdot, are completely ignored. In this
   study, we make the first attempt to investigate the influence diffusion
   and influence maximization in OSNs with both friend and foe relations,
   which are modeled using positive and negative edges on signed networks.
   In particular, we extend the classic voter model to signed networks and
   analyze the dynamics of influence diffusion of two opposite opinions. We
   first provide systematic characterization of both short-term and
   long-term dynamics of influence diffusion in this model and illustrate
   that the steady state behaviors of the dynamics depend on three types of
   graph structures, which we refer to as balanced graphs, anti balanced
   graphs, and strictly unbalanced graphs. We then apply our results to
   solve the influence maximization problem and develop efficient
   algorithms to select initial seeds of one opinion that maximize either
   its short-term influence coverage or long-term steady state influence
   coverage. Extensive simulation results on both synthetic and real-world
   networks, such as Epinions and Slashdot, confirm our theoretical
   analysis on influence diffusion dynamics, and demonstrate the efficacy
   of our influence maximization algorithm over other heuristic algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Much like an individual's hairstyle, hair fibers along the scalp see a
   number of changes over the course of one's lifetime. As the decades
   pass, the shine and volume synonymous with youthful hair may give way to
   thin, dull, and brittle hair commonly associated with aging. These
   changes are a result of a compilation of genetic and environmental
   elements influencing the cells of the hair follicle, specifically the
   hair follicle stem cells and melanocytes. Telomere shortening, decrease
   in cell numbers, and particular transcription factors have all been
   implicated in this process. In turn, these molecular alterations lead to
   structural modifications of the hair fiber, decrease in melanin
   production, and lengthening of the telogen phase of the hair cycle.
   Despite this inevitable progression with aging, there exists an array of
   treatments such as light therapy, minoxidil, and finasteride which have
   been designed to mitigate the effects of aging, particularly balding and
   thinning hair. Although each works through a different mechanism, all
   aim to maintain or potentially restore the youthful quality of hair. (C)

Abstract = {{Many complex systems can be described by agents that can be modeled as a
   network of dynamically interacting cyclo-stationary processes. Such
   systems arise in areas like power systems and climate sciences. For many
   of these systems a key objective is to understand mutual influences
   between various subsystems without altering the natural behavior of the
   system. Such an objective translates to unveiling the interconnection of
   the topology of the network using only passive means. Most existing
   related works have emphasized correlation based methods where
   interdependencies over different time-instants can be missed. Recent
   work where dynamic influences are incorporated assuming stationary
   statistics cannot accommodate applications that arise in many areas such
   as power and climate sciences. In this article an algorithm based on
   Wiener filtering is devised for the reconstruction of interconnectivity
   of dynamically related cyclo-stationary processes. It is shown that all
   existing interdependencies are detected and spurious detection remains
   local. Application to a microgrid power network is shown to yield useful
   insights.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a structured optimal-control framework to design
   coupling gains for synchronization of weakly nonlinear oscillator
   circuits connected in resistive networks with arbitrary topologies. The
   oscillators are modeled as weakly nonlinear Lienard-type circuits, and
   the coupling gain amounts to the current gain which scales the output
   current of the oscillator. The structured optimal-control problem allows
   us to seek a decentralized control strategy (equivalently, a diagonal
   feedback matrix) that precludes communications between oscillators. To
   this end, a sparsity-promoting optimal control algorithm is developed to
   tune the optimal diagonal feedback-gain matrix with minimal performance
   sacrifice. This involves solving an H-2 optimal control problem with
   l(1) regularization by applying the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM). Simulation studies with application to voltage
   regulation in islanded networks composed of powe-relectronic inverters
   are provided to validate the approach.}},

   naturally occurring systems and is also motivated by operating networked
   systems where the injection of an external signal might lead to
   undesired disruptions. Sufficient conditions on which signals should be

Abstract = {{In bulk power systems, spectral analysis of poorly damped modes is
   commonly used for identifying local and inter-area oscillations.
   Conventionally, these oscillations are mitigated by carefully tuned
   decentralized controllers. In this paper, we depart from the modal
   perspective and employ non-modal tools to analyze and control inter-area
   oscillations. Our input-output analysis examines power spectral density
   and variance amplification of stochastically forced systems and offers
   new insights relative to modal approaches. To improve upon the
   limitations of conventional wide-area control strategies, we also study
   the problem of signal selection and optimal design of sparse and
   block-sparse wide-area controllers. In our approach, we preserve
   rotational symmetry of the power network by allowing only relative angle
   measurements in the distributed controllers. We examine performance
   tradeoffs and robustness of sparse and block-sparse control
   architectures by studying the NETS-NYPS test system, and show that
   optimal retuning of fully-decentralized controllers can effectively
   guard against local and inter-area oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper concerns the input/output stability of two systems in
   closed-loop where stability is ensured by using open-loop properties of
   each subsystem. The literature is divided into consideration of
   time-domain and frequency-domain conditions. A complete time-domain
   approach is given by dissipative and topological separation theory,
   where both conditions are given in the time-domain. On the other hand,
   the frequency-domain integral quadratic constraints ( IQCs) framework
   uses only frequency-domain conditions. Between both extremes, the
   classical multiplier approach and the time-domain IQC framework can be
   seen as hybrid versions where one condition is tested in the time-domain
   and other condition is tested in the frequency-domain. The time-domain
   is more natural for nonlinear systems, and subsystems may be unbounded
   in time-domain analysis. However, the frequency-domain has two
   advantages: firstly if one block is linear, then frequency-domain
   analysis leads to elegant graphical and/or LMI conditions; secondly
   noncausal multipliers can be used.
   Recently the connection between frequency domain IQCs and dissipativity
   has been studied.. Here we use graph separation results to provide a
   unifying framework. In particular we show how a recent factorization
   result establishes a straightforward link, completing an analysis
   suggested previously. This factorization leads to a simple and
   insightful dissipative condition to analyse stability of the feedback
   interconnection.}},

Abstract = {{This paper outlines an optimization-based method to estimate the reach
   set of a system while acknowledging unknown-but-bounded input and
   parametric uncertainty in the underlying dynamical model. The approach
   is grounded in a second-order Taylor-series expansion of the system's
   state variables along the solution trajectories as a function of the
   uncertain elements. Subsequently, over the time horizon of interest,
   Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programs (QCQPs) are formulated to
   estimate maximum and minimum bounds on the state variables to recover
   the reach set. To contend with the nonconvexity of the QCQPs, Lagrangian
   relaxations are leveraged to formulate Semidefinite Programs (SDPs) that
   provide guaranteed bounds to the solutions of the QCQPs. Applications of
   the method to quantify the impact of uncertain power injections in
   power-system dynamic models are demonstrated with numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a variant of the classical linear quadratic Gaussian
   regulator (LQG) in which penalties on the endpoint state are replaced by
   the specification of the terminal state distribution. The resulting
   theory considerably differs from LQG as well as from formulations that
   bound the probability of violating state constraints. We develop results
   for optimal state-feedback control in the two cases where i) steering of
   the state distribution is to take place over a finite window of time
   with minimum energy, and ii) the goal is to maintain the state at a
   stationary distribution over an infinite horizon with minimum power. For
   both problems the distribution of noise and state are Gaussian. In the
   first case, we show that provided the system is controllable, the state
   can be steered to any terminal Gaussian distribution over any specified
   finite time-interval. In the second case, we characterize explicitly the
   covariance of admissible stationary state distributions that can be
   maintained with constant state-feedback control. The conditions for
   optimality are expressed in terms of a system of dynamically coupled
   Riccati equations in the finite horizon case and in terms of algebraic
   conditions for the stationary case. In the case where the noise and
   control share identical input channels, the Riccati equations for
   finite-horizon steering become homogeneous and can be solved in closed
   form. The present paper is largely based on our recent work in {[}1],
   {[}2] and presents an overview of certain key results.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an observer for a magnetic field based position
   sensor. The process model for the magnetic field sensing system is
   linear while the output equation is highly nonlinear. Previous results
   on observer design in nonlinear systems have mostly assumed that the
   output equation is linear, even if the process dynamics are nonlinear.
   This paper presents a new observer design technique that can rigorously
   address the presence of nonlinearity in the output equation. The
   estimation error dynamics of a two degree-of-freedom observer is
   transformed into a Lure system in which the sector condition for the
   nonlinearity in the feedback loop is constructed from the element-wise
   bounds on the Jacobian matrix of the nonlinear measurement equation. The
   developed observer design technique is applied to non-intrusive
   estimation of the position of a piston inside a pneumatic cylinder.
   Experimental results show that the observer can accurately estimate
   piston position with sub-mm accuracy. The advantages of the nonlinear
   observer over an extended Kalman Filter are demonstrated. The developed
   observer has applications in many other problems involving nonlinear
   output equations.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel additive cancellation signal (ACS)
   method for sidelobe suppression in non-contiguous orthogonal frequency
   division multiplexing (NC-OFDM) based CR systems. The key idea of the
   proposed method is to dynamically add several additive cancellation
   symbols on both the primary user (PU) subcarriers and the secondary user
   (SU) subcarriers, to generate the additive cancellation signals for
   suppressing the sidelobe power of NC-OFDM signals. Moreover, the ACS
   method formulates the problem of sidelobe suppression as a quadratically
   constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and the optimal additive
   cancellation signal can be obtained by the standard interior-point
   method. Simulation results show that the proposed ACS method can provide
   significant sidelobe suppression performance.}},

   this context. Without a-priori knowledge of any statistics of the

Abstract = {{The exact-repair problem for distributed storage systems is considered.
   Characterizing the optimal storage-vs repair bandwidth tradeoff for such
   systems remains an open problem for more than four storage nodes. A new
   family of information theoretic bounds is provided for the
   storage-vs-repair bandwidth tradeoff for all (n, k, d) systems. The
   proposed bound readily recovers Tian's result for the (4, 3, 3) system,
   and hence suffices for exact characterization for this system. In
   addition, the bound improves upon the existing bounds for the (5, 4, 4)
   system. More generally, it is shown that this bound characterizes the
   optimal boundary of the exact repair tradeoff for all distributed
   storage systems, with (n, k, d) = (n, n - 1, n - 1) when beta <= 2

   information. Interference among secondary users is modeled using a
   binary conflict graph, so that close-by secondary devices cannot
   transmit simultaneously. The optimal resource allocation dictates the
   power transmitted by each user; the rates at the transport, network and
   physical level, and the links to be activated. The design is castedas a
   nonlinear constrained optimization, and the solution is obtained using
   stochastic dual decomposition. Numerical experiments validate the

Abstract = {{Structural coverage metrics have been widely used to measure test suite
   adequacy as well as to generate test cases. In previous investigations,
   we have found that the fault-finding effectiveness of tests satisfying
   structural coverage criteria is highly dependent on program syntax -
   even if the faulty code is exercised, its effect may not be observable
   at the output. To address these problems, observability-based coverage
   metrics have been defined. Specifically, Observable MC/DC (OMC/DC) is a
   criterion that appears to be both more effective at detecting faults and
   more robust to program restructuring than MC/DC. Traditional
   counterexample-based test generation for OMC/DC, however, can be
   infeasible on large systems. In this study, we propose an incremental
   test generation approach that combines the notion of observability with
   dynamic symbolic execution. We evaluated the efficiency and
   effectiveness of our approach using seven systems from the avionics and
   medical device domains. Our results show that the incremental approach
   requires much lower generation time, while achieving even higher fault
   finding effectiveness compared with regular OMC/DC generation.}},

Abstract = {{Simple stochastic logic gates can compute complex functions using
   stochastic computing. A stochastic number is encoded by a unary bit
   stream where each bit is 0 or 1. The value of the number is represented
   by the percent of l's in the number, and is interpreted as a
   probability. Each bit of the stochastic number can be modeled as a
   Bernoulli random variable, and each stochastic number can be represented
   by a binomial random variable. The variance of a stochastic number is
   given by p(l - p)/N where N represents the number of bits in the
   sequence, and p represents the mean value of the number. For long
   word-lengths, a binomial random variable behaves as a Gaussian random
   variable. The mean and variance of a two-input stochastic logic gate are
   dependent on the bit-level correlation of the two inputs. This paper
   derives closed-form expressions for mean and variance of two-input
   stochastic logic gates with correlated inputs. An approach to synthesize
   correlated stochastic bit streams with specified correlation from
   uncorrelated bit streams is also presented. Using the proposed synthesis
   method, stochastic logic gates are simulated with correlated inputs. The
   simulated values of means and variances are shown to be the same as the
   theoretical values; thus, the closed-form expressions are validated.}},

Abstract = {{Markov chains are commonly used in numerous signal processing and
   statistical modeling applications. This paper describes an approach to
   implement any first-order Markov chain using molecular reactions in
   general and DNA in particular. Markov chain consists of two parts: a set
   of states, and state transition probabilities. Each state is modeled by
   a unique molecular type, referred as a data molecule. Each state
   transition is modeled by a unique molecular type, referred as a control
   molecule, and a unique molecular reaction. Each reaction consumes data
   molecules of one state and produces data molecules of another state. The
   concentrations of control molecules are initialized according to the
   probabilities of corresponding state transitions in the chain. The
   steady-state probability of Markov chain is computed by equilibrium
   concentration of data molecules. We demonstrate our method for the
   Gambler's Ruin problem as an instance of the Markov chain process. Both
   stochastic chemical kinetics and mass-action kinetics validate the
   computed probabilities using the proposed model. The molecular reactions
   are then mapped to DNA strand displacement reactions. The error in the
   probability of ruin computed by the proposed model is shown to be less
   than 1\% for DNA strand displacement reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its significant economic and environmental impact, sharing the
   ride among a number of drivers (i.e., car pooling) has recently gained
   significant interest from industry and academia. Hence, a number of ride
   sharing services have appeared along with various algorithms on how to
   match a rider request to a driver who can provide the ride sharing
   service. However, existing techniques have several limitations that
   affect the quality of the ride sharing service, and hence hinder its
   wide applicability. This paper proposes SHAREK; a scalable and efficient
   ride sharing service that overcomes the limitations of existing
   approaches. SHAREK allows riders requesting the ride sharing service to
   indicate the maximum price they are willing to pay for the service and
   the maximum waiting time before being picked up. In the mean time,
   SHAREK computes the price of the service based on the distance of the
   rider trip and the detour that the driver will make to offer the
   service. Then, SHAREK returns a set of drivers that can make it to the
   rider within its price and temporal constraints. Since there could be
   many of such drivers, SHAREK internally prunes those drivers that are
   dominated by others, i.e., they provide higher price and higher waiting
   time than other drivers. To realize its efficiency and scalability,
   SHAREK employs a set of early pruning techniques that minimize the need
   for any actual shortest path computations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents RECATHON; a context-aware recommender system built
   entirely inside a database system. Unlike traditional recommender
   systems that are context-free where they support the general query of
   Recommend movies for a certain user, RECATHON users can request
   recommendations based on their age, location, gender, or any other
   contextual/demographical/preferential user attribute. A main challenge
   of supporting such kind of recommenders is the difficulty of deciding
   what attributes to build recommenders on. RECATHON addresses this
   challenge as it supports building recommenders in database systems in an
   analogous way to building index structures. Users can decide to create
   recommenders on selected attributes, e.g., age and/or gender, and then
   entertain efficient support of multidimensional recommenders on the
   selected attributes. RECATHON employs a multi-dimensional index
   structure for each built recommender that can be accessed using novel
   query execution algorithms to support efficient retrieval for
   recommender queries. Experimental results based on an actual prototype
   of RECATHON, built inside PostgreSQL, using real MovieLens and
   Foursquare data show that RECATHON exhibits real time performance for
   large-scale multidimensional recommendation.}},

Abstract = {{Road-network data compression reduces the size of the network to occupy
   lesser storage with the aim to fit small form-factor routing devices,
   mobile devices, or embedded systems. Compression (1) reduces the storage
   cost of memory and disks, and (2) reduces the I/O and communication
   overhead. There are several road network compression techniques proposed
   in literature. These techniques are evaluated by their compression
   ratios. However, none of these techniques takes into consideration the
   possibility that the generated compressed data can be used directly in
   map-matching. Map-matching is an essential component of routing services
   that matches a measured latitude and longitude of an object to an edge
   in the road network graph. In this paper, we propose a novel compression
   technique, named COMA, that significantly reduces the size of a given
   road network data. Another advantage of the proposed technique is that
   it enables the generated compressed road network graph to be used
   directly in map-matching without a need to decompress it beforehand.
   COMA smartly deletes those nodes and edges that will not affect neither
   the graph connectivity nor the accuracy of map-matching objects'
   location. COMA is equipped with an adjustable parameter, termed conflict
   factor C, by which location-based services can achieve a trade-off
   between the compression gain and map-matching accuracy. Extensive
   experimental evaluation on real road network data demonstrates
   competitive performance on compression-ratio and the high map-matching
   accuracy achieved by the proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a novel location aware services framework termed COMA for
   efficient compression and map-matching of road-network graph data. Key
   innovations include working demonstration of a new compression algorithm
   to eliminate nodes and edges that do not affect graph connectivity while
   ensuring object location map-matching accuracy. The demonstration
   features: (1) Algorithm to leverage compressed versions of road-network
   graphs for map-matching of objects locations to correct road edges
   without decompression; (2) Upwards of 75\% compression ratio implying
   significant savings for road-network data transmission costs; a key
   constraint for internet of things (IOT) devices, and (3) Use of a new
   controllable parameter; termed conflict factor C, whereby location aware
   services can trade the compression efficiency with map-matching accuracy
   at varying granularity. In addition to above features the demonstration
   features an extensible framework that enables experimentation and
   comparison between various compression and map-matching algorithms in a
   rich interactive interface. In this paper we outline data management
   challenges for location aware services using various scenarios for
   compression of a real road-network map of a large region of United
   States, along with both real and synthetic moving object trajectories
   distributed over this map. We describe the COMA framework through its
   map-based Graphical User Interface, ability to select the area of
   interest from the road-network map, and submit a compression request.
   COMA can export and save the compact versions of the selected area in
   different formats and plot the compressed graph over the original map
   for visual inspection to study the differences between compressed and
   uncompressed versions and various related statistics.}},

   variety of predictive spatio-temporal queries. These queries are widely
   used in several applications including traffic management,

   function to: (a) scale up to large number of moving objects, and (b)
   support predictive queries. Panda does not only aim to predict the query
   answer, but, it also aims to predict the incoming queries such that
   parts of the query answer can be precomputed before the query arrival.
   Panda maintains a tunable threshold that achieves a trade-off between
   the predictive query response time and the system overhead in
   precomputing the query answer. Equipped with a Graphical User Interface

Abstract = {{Therapeutic resistance arises as a result of evolutionary processes
   driven by dynamic feedback between a heterogeneous cell population and
   environmental selective pressures. Previous studies have suggested that
   mutations conferring resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) in non-small-cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) cells lower the fitness of resistant cells relative to
   drug-sensitive cells in a drug-free environment. Here, we hypothesize
   that the local tumor microenvironment could influence the magnitude and
   directionality of the selective effect, both in the presence and absence
   of a drug. Using a combined experimental and computational approach, we
   developed a mathematical model of preexisting drug resistance describing
   multiple cellular compartments, each representing a specific tumor
   environmental niche. This model was parameterized using a novel
   experimental dataset derived from the HCC827 erlotinib-sensitive and
   -resistant NSCLC cell lines. We found that, in contrast to in the
   drug-free environment, resistant cells may hold a fitness advantage
   compared to parental cells in microenvironments deficient in oxygen and
   nutrients. We then utilized the model to predict the impact of drug and
   nutrient gradients on tumor composition and recurrence times,
   demonstrating that these endpoints are strongly dependent on the
   microenvironment. Our interdisciplinary approach provides a model system
   to quantitatively investigate the impact of microenvironmental effects
   on the evolutionary dynamics of tumor cells.}},

Abstract = {{Complex networks are becoming indispensable parts of our lives. The
   Internet, wireless (cellular) networks, online social networks, and

   drawn attentions from the computer science research community to explore
   and investigate the fundamental properties of, and improve the user
   experiences on, these complex networks. This work focuses on
   understanding complex networks based on the graph spectrum, namely,
   developing and applying spectral graph theories and models for
   understanding and employing versatile and oblivious network information
   - asymmetrical characteristics of the wireless transmission channels,
   multiplex social relations, e.g., trust and distrust relations, etc - in

Abstract = {{Reachability is crucial to many network operations in various complex
   networks. More often than not, however, it is not sufficient simply to
   know whether a source node s can reach a target node t in the network.
   Additional information associated with reachability such as how long or
   how many possible ways node s may take to reach node t. In this paper we
   analyze another piece of important information associated with
   reachability - which we call pivotality. Pivotality captures how pivotal
   a role that a node k or a subset of nodes S may play in the reachability
   from node s to node t in a given network. We propose two important
   metrics, the avoidance and transit hitting times, which extend and
   generalize the classical notion of hitting times. We show these metrics
   can be computed from the fundamental matrices associated with the
   appropriately defined random walk transition probability matrices and
   prove that the classical hitting time from a source to a target can be
   decomposed into the avoidance and transit hitting times with respect to
   any third node. Through simulated and real-world network examples, we
   demonstrate that these metrics provide a powerful ranking tool for the
   nodes based on their pivotality in the reachability.}},

Abstract = {{Visual gaze movement is one of the main processes in human interaction
   with the physical environment, and is a manifestation of the visual
   perception process. In humans, the interaction of gaze with environment
   involves mainly three patterns including fixation, smooth pursuit and
   saccade. This paper investigates two classification techniques to
   identify gaze patterns: an empirical threshold method and a Hidden
   Markov Model (HMM). A registration process was initially performed to
   transform the gaze and environmental visual cues into a common
   coordinate system, which provides an additional feature to construct
   gaze models. With the gaze models, the HMM method accurately identifies
   gaze patterns in gaze trajectories, and in addition enables three types
   of applications. One is the detailed analysis of visuo-motor control
   behavior. The second is gaze-mediated teleoperation, showing the
   real-time capability of the gaze classification method. The third is the
   application to surgery tasks, enabling surgical skill analysis.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores solutions to linearized power-flow equations with
   bus-voltage phasors represented in rectangular coordinates. The key idea
   is to solve for complex-valued perturbations around a nominal voltage
   profile from a set of linear equations that are obtained by neglecting
   quadratic terms in the original nonlinear power-flow equations. We prove
   that for lossless networks, the voltage profile where the real part of
   the perturbation is suppressed satisfies active-power balance in the
   original nonlinear system of equations. This result motivates the
   development of approximate solutions that improve over conventional DC
   power-flow approximations, since the model includes ZIP loads. For
   distribution networks that only contain ZIP loads in addition to a slack
   bus, we recover a linear relationship between the approximate voltage
   profile and the constant-current component of the loads and the nodal
   active- and reactive-power injections.}},

Abstract = {{Model-based testing of embedded real-time systems is challenging because
   platform-specific details are often abstracted away to make the models
   amenable to various analyses. Testing an implementation to expose
   non-conformance to such a model requires reconciling differences arising
   from these abstractions. Due to stateful behavior, naive comparisons of
   model and system behaviors often fail causing numerous false positives.
   Previously proposed approaches address this by being reactively
   permissive: passing criteria are relaxed to reduce false positives, but
   may increase false negatives, which is particularly bothersome for
   safety-critical systems. To address this concern, we propose an

Abstract = {{Multi-threaded programs play an increasingly important role in current
   multi-core environments. Exposing concurrency bugs and debugging such
   multi-threaded programs have become quite challenging due to their
   inherent non-determinism. In order to eliminate such non-determinism,
   many approaches such as record-and-replay and other similar bug
   reproducing systems have been proposed. However, those approaches often
   suffer significant performance degradation because they require a large
   amount of recorded information and/or long analysis and replay time. In
   this paper, we propose an effective approach, ReCBuLC, to take advantage
   of the hardware clocks available on modern processors. The key idea is
   to reduce the recording overhead and analyzing events' global order by
   using time stamps recorded in each thread. Those timestamps are used to
   determine the global orders of shared accesses. To avoid the large
   overhead incurred in accessing system-wide global clock, we opt to use
   local per-core clocks that incur much less access overhead. We then
   propose techniques to resolve differences among local clocks and obtain
   an accurate global event order. By using per-core clocks,
   state-of-the-art bug reproducing systems such as PRES and CLAP can
   reduce the recording overheads by 1\% similar to 85\%, and the analysis
   time by 84.66\% similar to 99.99\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we extend the notion of locally repairable codes to secret
   sharing schemes. The main problem we consider is to find the optimal
   ways to distribute shares of a secret among a set of storage-nodes
   (participants) such that the content of each node (share) can be
   recovered by using contents of only few other nodes, and at the same
   time the secret can be reconstructed by only some allowable subsets of
   nodes. As a special case, an eavesdropper observing some set of a
   specified nodes (such as less than certain number of nodes) does not get
   any information. In other words, we propose to study a locally
   repairable distributed storage system that is secure against a passive
   eavesdropper that can observe some subsets of nodes.
   We provide a number of results related to such systems including
   upper-bounds and achievability results on the number of bits that can be
   securely stored with these constraints.}},

Abstract = {{Electronic Health Records (EHRs) consists of patient information such as
   demographics, medications, laboratory test results, diagnosis codes and
   procedures. Mining EHRs could lead to improvement in patient healthcare
   management as EHRs contain detailed information related to disease
   prognosis for large patient populations. We hypothesize that a patient's
   condition does not deteriorate at random; the trajectories, sequences in
   which diseases appear in a patient, are determined by a finite number of
   underlying disease mechanisms. In this work, we exploit this idea by
   predicting a patient's risk of mortality in the context of the metabolic
   syndrome by assessing which of many available trajectories a patient is
   following and progression along this trajectory. Implementing this idea
   required innovative enhancements both for the study design and also for
   the fitting algorithm. We propose a forensic-style study design, which
   aligns patients on last follow-up and measures time backwards. We modify
   the time-dependent covariate Cox proportional hazards model to better
   capture coefficients of covariate that follow a particular temporal
   sequence, such as trajectories. Knowledge extracted from such analysis
   can lead to personalized treatments, thereby forming the basis for
   future trajectory-centered guidelines.}},

Abstract = {{Quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) has a variety of
   applications in signal processing, communications, and networking - but
   in many cases the associated QCQP is non-convex and NP-hard. In such
   cases, semidefinite relaxation (SDR) followed by randomization, or
   successive convex approximation (SCA) are typically used for
   approximation. SDR and SCA work with one-sided non-convex constraints,
   but typically fail to produce a feasible point when there are two-sided
   or more generally indefinite constraints. A feasible point pursuit
   (FPP-SCA) algorithm that combines SCA with judicious use of slack
   variables and a penalty term was recently proposed to obtain feasible
   and near-optimal solutions with high probability in these difficult
   cases. In this contribution, we revisit FPP-SCA from a different point
   of view and recast the feasibility problem in a simpler, more compact
   way. Simulations show that the new approach outperforms the original
   FPP-SCA under certain conditions, thus providing a useful addition to
   our non-convex QCQP toolbox.}},

Abstract = {{Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an important digital signal processing
   (DSP) algorithm for analysis of the phase and frequency components of a
   time-domain signal. Canonic real-valued FFT (RFFT) approach improves the
   computation performance by completely eliminating arithmetic
   redundancies. The major advantage of the canonic RFFTs is that these
   require the least butterfly operations and only involve real datapath
   when mapped to architectures. In this paper, we study the performances
   of canonic RFFT computations for different radix factorizations. We
   compare various radices RFFTs along with their canonic variants from
   both arithmetic and architectural perspectives. It is shown that
   decimation-in-frequency (DIF) RFFT structures require less twiddle
   factor operations than their decimation-in-time (DIT) counterparts.
   However, we also show that canonic RFFTs may not be desirable when
   taking the cost of twiddle factor operations as the major consideration.}},

   important for a wide range of statistical signal processing and data
   analysis tasks. Distributed autocorrelation sensing strategies are of
   interest when multiple pieces or realizations of the time series are
   measured at different locations. This paper considers a distributed
   autocorrelation sensing scheme based on randomly filtered power
   measurements, each compressed down to one bit, without any sensor
   coordination. A Maximum Likelihood (ML) reconstruction scheme is
   proposed and is shown to work well, even at high overall compression
   ratios and with a substantial fraction of bit errors. Whereas the ML
   formulation appears non-convex, it is proven that it in fact possesses
   hidden convexity, which enables optimal solution. Simulations are used
   to illustrate the performance of the proposed ML approach.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of seizures is a difficult problem as the EEG patterns are
   not wide-sense stationary and change from seizure to seizure, electrode

   using a 4-second window with 50\% overlap from focus electrodes

   second-order Kalman filter and then input to three different classifiers
   which include AdaBoost, radial basis function kernel support vector
   machine (RBF-SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). The algorithm is
   tested on the long-term intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) database collected at
   the UMN epilepsy clinic. This database includes EEG recordings from 2
   patients sampled from varying number of electrodes sampled at 2kHz. It

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel structures for lattice IIR digital filters
   that are well suited for stochastic computing. Stochastic computing
   systems require fewer logic gates and are inherently fault-tolerant.
   Thus, these structures are appropriate for nanoscale CMOS technologies.
   It has been shown that stochastic IIR digital filters can be implemented
   using the basic lattice structure. However, these implementations
   require use of binary multipliers and, thus, suffer from increased
   hardware complexity. The key contribution of this paper lies in
   demonstrating that the proposed modified lattice IIR structures can be
   implemented using stochastic logic without requiring any binary
   multiplier except left-shift operations. A modified lattice structure is
   derived using scale factor s(i) = 1 +/- k(i) in the Schur Algorithm. Two
   architectures are proposed for stochastic lattice IIR filters. The first
   is based on the normalized lattice structure, where states are
   orthonormal, which prevents state overflow. The second is based on the
   proposed modified lattice structure. Binary multipliers are replaced by
   left-shift operations in the proposed structures. The proposed
   architectures require fewer stochastic number generators and
   stochastic-to-binary converters. Therefore, the area for the proposed
   design is 90\% less than the two's complement lattice filters.
   Additionally, compared to previous stochastic computing design, the
   hardware complexity is reduced by 60\%. Experimental results show that
   the output signal-to-error power ratio of the first implementation for
   narrow-band IIR filter increases by an order of magnitude, compared to
   previous stochastic designs. Simulation results also demonstrate high
   fault tolerance of the proposed structures. Synthesis results show
   excellent timing scalability of the proposed stochastic IIR filters with
   respect to the filter order, compared to 2's complement implementations.}},

Abstract = {{As an important supporting technology, floor localization in multi-floor
   buildings plays significant roles in many indoor Location Based Service
   ( LBS) applications such as the fire emergency response and the
   floor-based precise advertising. While the majority of
   Received-Signal-Strength(RSS)-fingerprint-based wireless indoor
   localization approaches suffer from the laborintensive and
   time-consuming site-survey and the low localization accuracy,
   barometer-based floor localization is another promising direction due to
   the increasing availability of the barometer-sensor-equipped
   smartphones. This paper is the first indoor localization work that
   exploits the combination of Wi-Fi RSS and barometric pressure for
   accurate floor localization. Compared with an art-of-the-state
   algorithm, B-Loc, the highlight of the proposed BarFi approach is that
   it does not need all client smartphones but only low percentage of them
   equipped with barometer sensors. Using crowdsourcing, BarFi eliminates
   the need of war-driving of site-survey and prior knowledge about both
   the Wi-Fi infrastructure and the floor plans of buildings. The key
   novelty of BarFi is a two-phase clustering method proposed to train the
   RSS fingerprint floor map with the aid of barometer, which consists of a
   barometer-based hierarchical clustering phase and a Wi-Fi-based K-Means
   clustering phase. The real-world evaluation shows BarFi achieves
   satisfying performance that its accuracy reaches 96.3\% when the
   proportion of smartphones equipped with barometer sensors is 12\% out of
   the total.}},

   The objectives of this workshop are to bring together researchers and
   industrial practitioners from SBST and the wider software engineering
   community to share experience and provide directions for future
   research, and to encourage the use of search techniques to combine
   aspects of testing with other aspects of the software engineering
   lifecycle.
   Three full research papers, three short papers, and three position
   papers will be presented in the two-day workshop. Additionally, six
   development groups have pitted their test generation tools against a
   common set of programs and benchmarks, and will present their techniques
   and results. This report will give the background of the workshop and
   detail the provisional program.}},

Abstract = {{Many real-world (cyber-)physical infrastructure systems are
   multi-layered, consisting of multiple inter-dependent networks/layers.
   Due to this interdependency, the failure cascade can be catastrophic in
   a inter-dependent, multi-layered system, and even lead to the break-down
   of the entire system. The 2003 blackout of the Italian power grid is
   reportedly the result of a cascading failure due to the inter-dependency
   of the power grid and the communication network that it relies on. In
   this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for studying cascading
   failures in an inter-dependent, multi-layer system, where we consider
   the effects of cascading failures both within and across different
   layers. The goal of the study is to investigate how different couplings
   (i.e., inter-dependencies) between network elements across layers affect
   the cascading failure dynamics. Through experiments using the proposed
   framework, we show that under the one-to-one coupling, how nodes from
   two inter-dependent networks are coupled together play a crucial role in
   the final size of the resulting failure cascades: coupling corresponding
   nodes from two networks with equal importance (i.e., ``high-to-high{''}
   coupling) result in smaller failure cascades than other forms of
   inter-dependence coupling such as ``random{''} or ``low-to-high{''}
   coupling. Our results shed lights on potential strategies for mitigating
   cascading failures in inter-dependent networks.}},

Abstract = {{As the electrical grid evolves into a smart grid, efficient routing of
   power through transmission lines becomes essential to meet power
   demands. Real-time computations of line temperature and line current
   become important for dynamically rating transmission lines. This process
   becomes challenging as the transmission line system consists of complex
   electrical and thermal dynamics, which exist simultaneously and interact
   with each other. This makes the system computationally `stiff' for
   control design purposes and also for real-time/online control
   implementations. The inherent time scale nature of transmission lines
   are not well addressed in the IEEE 738 Standard, and require a better
   understanding to efficiently calculate ampacity levels based on line
   temperature. In this paper, a time domain modeling approach is proposed
   for a short-length transmission line, which captures the time scale
   nature of transmission lines. A software control design, utilizing the
   line's time scale behavior, is proposed that mitigates perturbations in
   a transmission line.}},

   compressive sensing method from our own previous work (which examined
   the task of identifying arbitrary sets of outlier columns in large
   matrices) to settings where the outlier columns occur in groups, and
   establish theoretical results certifying that accurate group-structured
   inference is achievable using very few linear measurements of the image,
   subject to some (arguably) minor structural assumptions on the image
   itself. We also demonstrate, through extensive numerical simulations,
   our proposed algorithm in a salient object detection task, and show that
   it simultaneously achieves low sample and computational complexity,
   while exhibiting performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods that
   acquire and process the entire image.}},

Abstract = {{The abundance of compute and storage resources available in the cloud
   makes it well-suited to addressing the limitations of mobile devices. We
   explore the use of cloud infrastructure to optimize content-centric
   mobile applications, which can have high communication and storage
   requirements, based on the analysis of user activity. We present two
   specific optimizations, precaching and prefetching, as well as the
   design and implementation of a middleware framework that allows mobile
   application developers to easily utilize these techniques. Our framework
   is fully generalizable to any content-centric mobile application, a
   large and growing class of Internet applications. A news aggregation
   application is used as a case study to evaluate our implementation. We
   make use of a cosine similarity scheme to identify users with similar
   interests, which in turn is used to determine what content to prefetch.
   Various cache algorithms, implemented for our framework, are also
   considered. A workload trace and simulation are used to measure the
   performance of the application and framework. We observe a dramatic
   improvement in application performance due to use of our framework with
   a reasonable amount of overhead. Our system also significantly
   outperforms a baseline implementation that performs the same
   optimizations without taking user activity into account.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years, with the growth of social network users, the social
   network have become a more and more important platform for sharing
   information. The growth of social network users inevitably leads to the
   appearance of spammers, who usually spread spam information, post
   reduplicate messages to mess up legitimate users' reading timeline or
   affect their operation feeling on social networks. As one of the largest
   online social networks in China, although Weibo system has already
   adopted certain kinds of spammer detection approaches, there are still
   many spammers existing in Weibo. Hence, in this paper, we propose a two
   phase based spammer detection approach. In this approach, firstly we
   take the existing works about the user feature as the first phase. In
   addition, we introduce content mining as the second phase in spammer
   detection. Technically, LDA is introduced to analyze the topics of a
   user in Weibo. More specifically, if his/her topics are usually spammed,
   we can claim that the user is a spammer. Experimental results show that
   our proposed approach is better than the existing approaches on spammer
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Given learning samples from a raster dataset, spatial decision tree
   learning aims to find a decision tree classifier that minimizes
   classification errors as well as salt-and-pepper noise. The problem has
   important societal applications such as land cover classification for
   natural resource management. However, the problem is challenging due to
   the fact that learning samples show spatial autocorrelation in class
   labels, instead of being independently identically distributed. Related
   work relies on local tests (i.e., testing feature information of a
   location) and cannot adequately model the spatial autocorrelation
   effect, resulting in salt-and-pepper noise. In contrast, in my recent
   papers, we proposed a focal-test-based spatial decision tree (FTSDT), in
   which the tree traversal direction of a sample is based on both local
   and focal (neighborhood) information. We introduced a focal test
   approach with adaptive neighborhoods that avoids over-smoothing in
   wedge-shaped areas. We also conducted computational refinement on the
   FTSDT training algorithm by reusing focal values across candidate
   thresholds. Theoretical analysis shows that the refined training
   algorithm is correct and more scalable. Experiment results on real world
   datasets show that new FTSDT with adaptive neighborhoods improves
   classification accuracy, and that our computational refinement
   significantly reduces training time.}},

   degree-adjusting and location-choosing and tries to minimize the
   influence caused by prefetcher for each core. AGP could produce more
   timely prefetched requests reducing the cache pollutions and
   contentions. Across a variety of PARSEC benchmarks, AGP can contribute
   6.5\% (up to 36\%) of performance improvement on a 4-core multicore

Abstract = {{Computer architects face two major challenges in building future
   exa-scale systems: high energy consumption and the increasing gap
   between processor and storage speeds. Moving the processing closer to
   the data, inside the persistent storage, will help mitigate these
   challenges. This will result in a hierarchical compute structure across
   the system with a major component of the processing hierarchy inside the
   Solid State Drive. This new architecture is called the Storage
   Processing Unit. We perform design space exploration and propose several
   optimizations to the application space and the architectural space. This
   research significantly improves the energy use and performance of the
   system. We observe energy savings from 11 - 423X and performance gains
   from 4 - 66X for applications including k-means, Sparse BLAS, and
   others.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we experimentally observe the existence of spatiotemporal
   correlation among adjacent wireless links within short time intervals.
   Such an observation calls attention to potential errors in existing
   popular metrics built upon the assumption of link independence.
   Specifically we propose cETX (correlated ETX), a generalized metric, to
   compensate for estimation errors suffered by the widely-adopted ETX in
   the presence of correlated interference. To the best of our knowledge,
   this is the first work to introduce a unified metric embracing both
   temporal and spatiotemporal correlations. The highlight of the cETX
   metric is its broad applicability and effectiveness. Evaluations on
   ZigBee (802.15.4) and Wi-Fi (802.11b/g/n) testbeds deployed in a lab,
   corridor, and on a bridge reveal that: Simply replacing ETX with cETX
   (i) cuts down the error by 70.2\% and 62.1\%, respectively, and (ii)
   saves averages of 22\% and 37\% communication cost in three unicast
   {[}4, 13, 17] and nine broadcast protocols {[}7, 18, 23, 24, 27, 30, 40]

Abstract = {{In this paper, we define a time-extended multi-robot task allocation
   problem, design and analyze some heuristics to tackle the problem
   complexity in computational resource constrained settings. The robots
   (or agents) can perform a limited amount of work per unit of time, while
   the tasks have durations and deadlines by which they must be completed.
   These constraints, in addition to a relatively small number of agents,
   may not allow the allocation of all tasks. The heuristics we present are
   easy-to-implement, tuning free and fast. We analyze these heuristics
   theoretically with respect to computational complexity. Then, we
   empirically compare them with respect to performance criteria on a
   synthetic testset. In so doing, we offer solutions for devices with
   computation power limitations. The same algorithms can also be embedded
   into metaheuristics or hyper-heuristics to efficiently and effectively
   solve the problem.}},

Abstract = {{Although supporting Quality of Service (QoS) on the traditional Internet
   has been extremely challenging, QoS supports are still highly desirable
   for many real-time applications. While existing QoS schemes often show
   poor scalability, low efficiency, and limited QoS supports, the fast
   development of Software Define Networks (SDNs) provides new
   opportunities to address QoS support with its centralized network
   control.
   In this paper, we propose a synchronized architecture to exploit the
   unique features of SDNs without conducting static reservations. Assume
   all routers are synchronized in time, we can precisely determine the
   upstream delay of a packet at a router. Meanwhile, because we also know
   the fairly accurate resource availability on its downstream routers
   (from the SDN controller), we can determine the packet's service
   priority on its current router based on its end-to-end (e2e) delay
   requirement and the expected delay that the packet may experience in its
   downstream. In particular, we propose a synchronized multi-hop
   scheduling (SMS) scheme to exploit both upstream information and
   downstream resource availability to speed up or slow down a packet. This
   is completely different from all existing per-hop or multi-hop schemes
   that mostly utilize upstream information. Furthermore, we propose to
   selectively drop a packet that is unlikely to meet its deadline. Our
   simulation results show that the proposed scheme outperforms existing
   schemes in packet missing rates.}},

Abstract = {{Flexible electronics has gained increasing attention for biomedical
   engineering applications, solar cell and so on. In this paper, an
   SU-8/silicon(100)/SU-8 flexible composite sandwich structure is studied.
   Besides preventing corrosion to the underneath thin silicon membrane,
   SU-8 photoresist coated on the silicon membrane improves its flexibility
   as shown by a finite element (FE) simulation utilizing ANSYS software.
   Using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposited SiO2/Si3N4 composite film
   as an etching mask, a 4 `' silicon(100) wafer was thinned to 26 mu m
   without rupture in a 30 wt.\% KOH solution. The thinned wafer was coated
   on both sides with 20 mu m of SU-8 photoresist and cut into strips. And
   then the strips were bent by a caliper to measure its radius of
   curvature. A sector model of bending deformation was adopted to estimate
   the radius of curvature. The determined minimal bending radius of the
   polymer-sandwiched ultra-thin silicon layer is no more than 3.3mm. The
   polymer-sandwiched ultra-thin silicon(100) layer can be used as a
   flexible substrate. And the fabrication of this sandwich structure is
   compatible with conventional microelectronic fabrication processing. It
   can be used as a post-fabrication process for high performance flexible
   electronics.}},

Abstract = {{To manage design complexity and provide verification tractability,
   models of complex cyber-physical systems are typically hierarchically
   organized into multiple abstraction layers. High-level analysis explores
   interactions of the system with its physical environment, while embedded
   software is developed separately based on derived requirements. This
   separation of low-level and high-level analysis also gives hope to
   scalability, because we are able to use tools that are appropriate for
   each level. When attempting to perform compositional reasoning in such
   an environment, care must be taken to ensure that results from one tool
   can be used in another to avoid errors due to ``mismatches{''} in the
   semantics of the underlying formalisms. This paper proposes a formal
   approach for linking high-level continuous time models and lower-level
   discrete time models.}},

Abstract = {{Remote sensing data collected by satellites are now made publicly
   available by several space agencies. This data is very useful for
   scientists pursuing research in several applications including climate
   change, desertification, and land use change. The benefit of this data
   comes from its richness as it provides an archived history for over 15
   years of satellite observations for natural phenomena such as
   temperature and vegetation. Unfortunately, the use of such data is very
   limited due to the huge size of archives (> 500TB) and the limited
   capabilities of traditional applications. This paper introduces SHAHED;
   a MapReduce-based system for querying, visualizing, and mining large
   scale satellite data. SHAHED considers both the spatial and temporal
   aspects of the data to provide efficient query processing at large
   scale. The core of SHAHED is composed of four main components. The
   uncertainty component recovers missing data in the input which comes
   from cloud coverage and satellite mis-alignment. The indexing component
   provides a novel multi-resolution quad-tree-based spatio-temporal index
   structure, which indexes satellite data efficiently with minimal space
   overhead. The querying component answers selection and aggregate queries
   in real-time using the constructed index. Finally, the visualization
   component uses MapReduce programs to generate heat map images and videos
   for user queries. A set of experiments running on a live system deployed
   on a cluster of machines show the efficiency of the proposed design. All
   the features supported by SHAHED are made accessible through an easy to
   use web interface that hides the complexity of the system and provides a
   nice user experience.}},

Abstract = {{Free carrier absorption is a major component of the laser-induced
   breakdown of optical materials. Free carriers mediate intense absorption
   of incident laser light, and the resulting heat transfers to the
   lattice, generating more carriers, creating a catastrophic runaway
   process. Unfortunately, measurements at very low levels of free carriers
   relevant to laser breakdown are very difficult, particularly when
   measurements must be taken at highly elevated temperatures. This paper
   describes a photothermal common path interferometer (PCI) system that is
   enhanced by use of micromachined heaters to control local substrate
   temperatures. The temperature dependence of the free carrier absorption
   of aluminum oxide and silicon are measured. The aluminum oxide is shown
   to have essentially no variation in absorption with temperature up to
   700K, but silicon shows an exponential increase as would be expected by
   the relative sizes of their bandgaps.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we examine the effect of surrounding liquid on the motion
   of gravity-driven drops through a round-edged circular orifice using
   high-speed visualization and refractive index matched PIV. The overall
   motion of the drop is separated into three stages: pre-impact,
   penetration and release. We show that in liquid/liquid systems, the
   surrounding fluid influences the drop velocity during both pre-impact
   and release stages. During the pre-impact stage, the drop approaches the
   orifice by displacing the surrounding liquid radially across the plate
   as well as axially through the orifice. During the release stage on the
   other hand, surrounding fluid is drawn downward into the orifice as the
   drop exits below the plate. In both cases, the drop decelerates due to
   added mass and viscous effects, which are negligible in liquid/gas
   flows. Drop breakup is promoted by a higher viscosity surrounding such
   that the volume of the satellite drop increases when the
   drop-to-surrounding-fluid viscosity ratio is decreased. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel unsupervised change detection algorithm based on
   game theory is proposed for synthetic aperture radar(SAR) images. With
   the introduction of Nash-game theory, we find the balance of
   segmentation accuracy and overall restoration performance. Restoration
   of images plays a denoising role due to the complex movement while
   obtaining a SAR image. The Segmentation procedure transfers the
   difference map into change map. To make the algorithm less
   time-consuming, we analyze the state-of-the-art methods for generating
   the change map and finally select the minus map as the preferred one.
   The experiment based on the proposed methodology proves the accuracy and
   robustness of our algorithm compared with several well-known change
   detection techniques on both noise-free and noisy satellite images.
   Further optimization methods are discussed in the end.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks (ANNs) usually require a very large number of
   computation nodes and can be implemented either in software or directly
   in hardware, such as FPGAs. Software-based approaches are offline and
   not suitable for realtime applications, but they support a large number
   of nodes. FPGA-based implementations, in contrast, can greatly speedup
   the computation time. However, resource limitations in an FPGA restrict
   the maximum number of computation nodes in hardwarebased approaches.
   This work exploits stochastic bit streams to implement the Restricted
   Boltzmann Machine (RBM) handwritten digit recognition application
   completely on an FPGA. Exploiting this approach saves a large number of
   hardware resources making the FPGA-based implementation of large ANNs
   feasible.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports a series of building block experiments for discrete
   hole film cooling. Seven different configurations, including variations
   in injection wall curvature, mainstream pressure gradient, and boundary
   layer thickness are measured for a round film cooling hole, inclined 30
   degrees at injection, and operated at a blowing ratio of unity. Full
   three dimensional, three component velocity fields and scalar coolant
   concentration fields are acquired using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
   techniques. The results show the effect of varying the mainstream
   condition on the mean coolant concentration distribution and mean
   velocity field, including the counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP), a
   dominant feature of jet in crossflow type flows. The present study
   focuses on an analysis of the building block configurations only
   possible with full three dimensional velocity and concentration fields.
   Several scalar parameters including normalized perimeter, jet
   trajectory, maximum coolant concentration, and coolant concentration
   spread are extracted from the collected data and compared across the
   different configurations. The results indicate that the pressure
   gradient variations have the strongest effect on the calculated
   quantities, the boundary layer slightly less, and the curvature very

Abstract = {{The flow field in the passage of a high pressure gas turbine is quite
   complex, involving strong secondary flows, transverse pressure gradients
   and strong streamwise acceleration. This complexity may have an adverse
   effect on cooling of the hub endwall, which is subjected to high thermal
   loading due to the flat combustor exit temperature profile of modern
   low-NOx systems. Therefore, given material limitations, better cooling
   management techniques that can be included with certainty in new gas
   turbine designs are needed. In the present study, film cooling has been
   investigated experimentally in a stationary linear cascade. The flow is
   representative of a high pressure gas turbine rotor with combustor liner
   coolant introduced to the approach flow. Focus is on the endwall
   axisymmetric contouring and the cooling effect of leakage flow bled from
   the compressor through the stator-rotor disc cavity. Two endwall
   contours, `shark nose' (gradual slope over a larger distance) and
   `dolphin nose' (steep slope over a shorter distance), are considered and
   comparison is made under conditions of three mass flow rates (MFR) of
   leakage, 0.5\%, 1.0\% and 1.5\% of the approach flow rate. The
   performance of both endwall contours is compared at different streamwise
   locations in terms of adiabatic effectiveness values over the endwall.
   This study gives enhanced insight into the physics of coolant flow
   mixing, migration and subsequent coverage over the endwall. The results
   show the cooling effects of the contoured shapes over a range of leakage
   flow rates in the strong secondary flow environment. It is found that
   the leakage flow plays a crucial role in enhancing coolant coverage over
   the endwall. To add to our knowledge of mixing effects, detailed thermal
   field data are taken in the leakage flow discharge region. Doing so
   helps explain the behavior of the flow as it is ejected into the passage
   and interacts with the mainstream flow.}},

Abstract = {{Transoceanic video telephony (TVT) over the Internet is challenging due
   to 1) longer round-trip delay, 2) larger number of relay hops, and 3)
   higher packet loss rate. Real-world measurements of Skype, Facetime, and
   QQ confirm that their TVT service quality is mostly unsatisfactory.
   Recently, when using WeChat to make transoceanic video calls, we are
   fortunate to find that it achieves stably smooth TVT. To explore how
   this is possible, we conduct in-depth measurements of WeChat data flow.
   In particular, we discover that the service provider of WeChat deploys a
   novel, specially designed ``twin clouds{''} based architecture to
   deliver transoceanic (UDP) packets. Thus, data delivery between two
   callers is no longer point-to-point (used by Skype, Facetime, and QQ)
   over the best-effort Internet. Instead, transoceanic video packets are
   delivered through the privileged backbone formed by twin clouds, which
   greatly reduces the round-trip delay, number of relay hops, and packet
   loss rate. Besides, whenever a packet is found lost, multiple duplicate
   packets are instantly sent to aggressively make up for the loss.
   On the other hand, we notice two-fold shortcomings of twin clouds.
   First, due to the sophisticated resource provisioning inside the twin
   clouds, the video startup time is considerably extended. Second, due to
   the high cost of deploying twin clouds, the capacity of the privileged
   backbone is limited and sometimes in shortage, and thus WeChat has to
   deliver data via a detour path with degraded performance. Ultimately, we
   believe that the twin clouds based data delivery solution will arouse a
   new direction of Internet video telephony research while still deserves
   optimization efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Modern data center nowadays leverages highly concurrent TCP connections
   between thousands of computer servers to achieve high system performance
   and service reliability. However, recent works have shown that, in the
   many-to-one and barrier-synchronized communication pattern, a large
   number of concurrent TCP connections suffer the TCP Incast problem due
   to packet drops in shallow-buffered Ethernet switches. This problem
   unavoidably leads to severe under-utilization of link capacity. In this
   work, we first reveal theoretically and empirically that controlling the
   IP packet size reduces the Incast probability much more effectively than
   controlling the congestion windows in the presence of severe congestion.
   We further present the design and implementation of Packet Slicing, a
   general supporting scheme that adjusts the packet size through a
   standard ICMP signaling method. Our method can be deployed on commodity
   switches with small firmware updates, while making no modification on
   end hosts. Another highlight of our work is Packet Slicing's broad
   applicability and effectiveness. We integrate Packet Slicing
   transparently (i.e., without modification) with three state-of-the-art
   TCP protocols designed for data centers on NS2 simulation and a physical
   testbed, respectively. The experimental results show that Packet Slicing
   remarkably improves network goodput across different TCP protocols by
   average 26x under severe congestion, while introducing little I/O
   performance impact on both switches and end hosts.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a modified space vector technique applied to an
   indirect matrix converter (IMC) which results in the reduction of common

   space vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM) method of controlling matrix
   converters involves the usage of two adjacent active vectors and one
   zero vector for both rectifying and inverting stages of the converter.
   By suitable selection of space vectors, the rectifying stage of the
   matrix converter can generate different levels of virtual DC-link
   voltage. This capability can be exploited for operation of the converter
   in different ranges of modulation indices for varying machine speeds.
   This results in lower common mode voltage and improves the harmonic
   spectrum of the output voltage, without increasing the number of
   switching transitions as compared to conventional modulation. The
   effectiveness of the algorithm is substantiated by simulations in
   MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a laboratory prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past years, modular multilevel converters (MMC) have been
   widely researched as a preferred option among voltage source converters
   for HVDC transmission system. The converter presents modularity to
   generate high number of output voltage levels by simple series
   connection of modules, resulting in higher reliability and easy failure
   management/maintenance. Synthesis of near sinusoidal output voltage
   waveforms by multilevel operation requires pulse-width modulation at
   relatively lower switching frequencies, resulting in reduced switching
   losses. In this paper, asymmetrical submodules in the MMC based HVDC
   system have been investigated. Use of asymmetrical submodules with
   different capacitor voltages results in lesser number of semiconductor
   switches for the same number of output voltage levels, thus reducing the
   overall size of the converter system. The operating principle using
   different carrier based modulation schemes is discussed in detail.
   Modified voltage balancing algorithms based on well known sorting
   algorithm and PI controller have been investigated for their feasibility
   to asymmetrical-MMC operation. Simulations with preliminary experimental
   results are presented to validate the proposed converter operation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel architectures for linearphase FIR digital

   fewer logic gates and are inherently fault-tolerant. Thus, these

   direct-form linear-phase FIR filters, linear-phase lattice filters
   require twice the number of multipliers but the same number of adders.
   The hardware complexities of stochastic implementations of linear-phase
   FIR filters for direct-form and lattice structures are comparable. Using
   speech signals from ICA `99 Synthetic Benchmarks, it is shown that, for
   linear-phase FIR filters, the error-to-signal power ratios of stochastic
   direct-form and stochastic lattice filters are about the same. However,
   the error-to-signal power of stochastic direct-form or lattice filter is
   an order of magnitude higher at very low fault rates but is more than
   two orders of magnitude less when the fault rate is about one percent
   than the direct-form, where the faults represent random bit-flips at

Abstract = {{Design of integrated circuits that cannot be reverse engineered is very
   important for protecting the intellectual property of owners. Integrated
   circuits can be obfuscated by introducing several modes into the control
   flow. Only one of the modes is the desired mode and other modes
   represent either meaningful modes where computations are partially
   correct or modes where the outputs computed are completely random. This
   paper presents a novel architecture and implementation of an obfuscated
   FFT for real input signals. The proposed design can be reconfigured to
   compute real FFTs of size N or N/4 with 2-parallel or 4-parallel
   processing, which are considered the 4 meaningful modes in the design. A
   4-bit configure data is used to select one of the four meaningful modes.
   The remaining 12 modes output partially correct results. The meaningful
   mode with the most number of blocks, i.e., an N-point, 4-parallel real
   FFT, is designed first and that circuit is then obfuscated with the
   inclusion of a reconfigurator and an obfuscating FSM. A novel control
   flow approach is introduced for hiding the modes for obfuscation. It is
   shown that the proposed approach results in minimal area and power

Abstract = {{The Fast Fourier transform (FFT) is an important operation in digital
   signal processing applications. In applications such as biomedical
   signal processing, the signals are real. The real-valued signals exhibit
   conjugate symmetry, giving rise to redundant values in the outputs. This
   property can be exploited to reduce arithmetic computations, area and
   power consumption. This paper presents hardware architectures for
   computing real FFT that exploits this conjugate symmetry property where
   the inputs are processed in a serial manner. This is facilitated by
   pushing the twiddle factor values across various butterfly stages. In
   this paper, two different serial FFT architectures are presented: one

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider enhancing a target speech from a
   single-channel noisy observation corrupted by non-stationary noises at
   low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We take a classification-based
   approach, where the objective is to estimate an Ideal Binary Mask (IBM)
   that classifies each time-frequency (T-F) unit of the noisy observation
   into one of the two categories: speech-dominant unit or noise-dominant
   unit. The estimated mask is used to binary weight the noisy mixture to
   obtain the enhanced speech. In the proposed system, the sparse
   non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is used to extract features from
   the noisy observation, followed by a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for
   classification. Compared with several existing classification-based
   systems, the proposed system uses minimal speech-specific domain
   knowledge, but is able to achieve better performance in certain low SNR
   regions. Moreover, the proposed system outperforms the traditional
   statistical method, especially in terms of improving the
   intelligibility.}},

Abstract = {{Multicast beamforming is a part of the Evolved Multimedia Broadcast
   Multicast Service (eMBMS) in the Long-Term Evolution (LTE) standard for
   efficient audio and video streaming. The associated beamformer design
   problem has drawn considerable attention over the last decade, but
   existing solutions are not quite satisfactOIy. The core problem is
   NP-hard, and the available approximations leave much to be desired in
   terms of achieving favorable performance-complexity trade-offs,
   especially for online implementation. This paper introduces a new class
   of adaptive multicast beamforming algorithms that simultaneously cover
   all bases - featuring guaranteed convergence and state-of-art
   performance at low complexity. Each update takes a step in the direction
   of an inverse Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) weighted linear combination of
   the SNR-gradient vectors of all users. Convergence is established by
   recourse to proportional fairness. Simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithms outperform Semi-Definite Relaxation (SDR) and
   Successive Linear Approximation (SLA - the prior state-of-art) at an
   order of magnitude lower complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Wideband spectrum sensing is one of the core components of cognitive
   radio. A novel frugal sensing scheme was recently proposed by Mehanna et
   al, aiming to crowdsource spectrum sensing operations to a network of
   sensors transmitting randomly filtered power measurement bits to a
   fusion center (FC). The ambient power spectrum is then estimated at the
   FC using a non-parametric approach. Here, it is assumed that the primary
   signal admits a Moving Average (MA) parametrization, and the frugal
   sensing problem is revisited from a parametric spectral estimation point
   of view. We show that the problem of estimating admissible MA parameters
   (and thus the MA power spectrum) from single bit quantized data can be
   formulated as a non-convex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Program
   (QCQP). This is NP-Hard in general, but semidefinite-relaxation (SDR)
   can be employed to obtain approximate solutions. Simulations reveal the
   superior performance of the SDR technique over the globally optimal
   solution obtained from the non-parametric formulation, when the MA
   assumption is valid.}},

   constitutes a three-layer hierarchical form. The first two layers,
   similar to the conventional sparse Bayesian learning, place a
   Gaussian-inverse-Gamma prior on the signal, while the third layer is
   newly added, with a prior placed on the parameters \{b(i)\}, where
   \{b(i)\} are parameters characterizing the sparsity-controlling
   hyperparameters \{alpha i\}. Such a modeling enables to automatically
   learn the true support from partly erroneous information through
   learning the values of the parameters \{b(i)\}. A variational Bayesian
   inference algorithm is developed based on the proposed prior model.

   show that in the presence of nonconvex objective function, classical
   ADMM is able to reach the set of stationary solutions for these
   problems, if the stepsize is chosen large enough. An interesting
   consequence of our analysis is that the ADMM is convergent for a family

   of the objective function. Our analysis is broadly applicable to many
   ADMM variants involving proximal update rules and various flexible block

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a beamforming algorithm for binaural hearing
   aids with enhanced noise suppression capability. The enhancement is
   based on incorporating a priori spatial information into the
   conventional multichannel Wiener filtering (MWF) approach for noise
   suppression. We develop a low complexity algorithm for the resulting
   quadratically constrained beam forming problem. Through numerical
   experiments, we demonstrate that the new algorithm can achieve better
   noise suppression performance than the existing beam forming algorithms
   under fairly realistic conditions. In addition, we propose two
   techniques to further reduce the algorithm's computational complexity
   and the communication overhead between two hearing aids without
   sacrificing the noise suppression performance.}},

Abstract = {{Due to its unique crystal structure, black phosphorus (BP) shows
   anisotropic electric and optical properties. In this work, we
   demonstrate its optical anisotropy by measuring its different
   absorptions of TE and TM modes travelling in silicon photonic
   waveguides. In the experiment, when BP crystal armchair axis is aligned
   perpendicularly to waveguide, the measured absorption coefficients for
   TE and TM are 0.821 dB/mu m and 0.413 dB/mu m, respectively. The result
   matches well with our calculated absorptions of 1.075 dB/mu m and 0.581
   dB/mu m for TE and TM modes. By carefully selecting BP thickness and
   orientation, it is possible to selectively absorb either TE or TM mode
   and as an example, TE/TM contrast can reach up to 1.1 dB/mu m when BP
   thickness is 100 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic cavitation is a technology for the process intensification
   of a heterogeneous liquid-liquid system, which was applied for the
   preparation of epoxy Fatty Acid Methyl Ester (FAME) without sulfuric
   acid. Compared with mechanical stirring, it could provide better mass
   transfer rate in a liquid-liquid system, and the reaction time was
   reduced more significantly. The effect of the relevant operating
   parameters in the hydrodynamic cavitation reactor on the epoxidation of
   FMAE was studied. Operating parameters included the circulation rate,
   volume ratio of oil phase to aqueous phase, and upstream pressure. The
   results show that the higher circulation rate could result in much more
   cavitation times of the system, which favors the epoxy reaction. The
   optimized conversion of FAME is obtained when volume ratio of oil phase
   to aqueous phase is 2.4:1. The higher upstream pressure leads to a
   better emulsification and higher conversion of FAME. However, too much
   of the upstream pressure would result in the degradation of epoxy FAME.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an overview of Dr. Cary Balas research activities in
   linear, parameter-varying (LPV) systems applied to aeroservoelastic
   (ASE) aircraft. More efficient aircraft can be designed by reducing
   weight, and structure in the wings and fuselage. This makes the aircraft
   more flexible leading to increased ASE effects. Such ASE aircraft, can
   be modeled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system with an arbitrary,
   i.e. not necessarily rational dependence on the scheduling parameters.
   The System involves coupling of the aircraft structural dynamics and
   aerodynamics thus resulting in large state dimension. This large
   dimension necessitates special approaches to modeling, order reduction
   and control design. The paper describes the process of designing an LPV
   controller for flutter suppression of a flexible unmanned aircraft
   starting from the nonlinear equation of motions for the vehicle. (C)

Abstract = {{A Bayesian neural decoding model requires the use of a neural encoding
   model. The parameters of this encoding model are generally fitted to
   some training data and used subsequently in the decoding of a test
   stimulus. One encoding model that has been widely used for the auditory
   system implies the use of a generalized linear model (GLM) having three
   parameters accounting respectively for the spontaneous rate of the
   neuron, its spectro-temporal receptive field and the dynamics of the
   neuron. Here we present a cross-validation study of the goodness of fit
   of a GLM encoding model in order to quantify the effects on the fitting
   of using model parameters estimated from a training data set on a test
   data set. The goodness of fit is measured using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)
   statistics. It is observed that using trained parameters on the test
   data yields a much poorer than expected goodness of fit of the auditory
   encoding model, with only 5\% of the neurons having a suitable fit.
   Moreover, we show that this poor goodness of fit is the result of all
   three parameters of the auditory GLM encoding model being inadequate for
   the test data. Using such parameters in a decoding framework may thus
   result in a biased decoded stimulus.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a low complexity beamforming algorithm for
   binaural hearing aids that achieves a high degree of noise suppression
   without causing significant speech distortion. Specifically, we
   incorporate a priori approximate spatial information in the formulation
   and develop several effective techniques to reduce the communication
   overhead. For the resulting quadratically constrained beamforming
   problem, we propose a low complexity algorithm based on the Alternating

   describes the nature of these errors and presents a systematic method

   obtained on AHRS, solving Wahba's problem using magnetometer
   measurements.
   In addition, the paper discusses practical challenges in measuring
   current onboard a small UAV using generic R/C components. A discussion

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel discrete time identification method for
   flexible wing aircraft models from simulated data. The special
   properties of the dynamics arise from the fact that all the poles are
   located very close to the unit circle and their location changes with
   the flight velocity. Using identification criteria based on Euclidean
   metrics suffers from the problem of obtaining instability in the search
   and also on the possible high number of poles.
   The paper offers an alternative approach and associated identification
   method to obtain the poles directly using Laguerre-representation of the
   impulse responses and hyperbolic metrics for identification criteria.
   The method utilises the hyperbolic geometrical properties of the
   descriptions of discrete-time signals and systems on the unit disc, and
   is strictly connected to the representations in rational orthogonal
   bases. Beyond the conceptual clarity, examples also confirm that it
   forms an adequate basis for estimating poles of systems as a significant
   part of an identification process.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel ``Modular Multilevel Converter{''} (MMC)
   topology. The topology takes advantage of the MMC characteristics by
   offering multilevel output voltage with low Total Harmonic Distortion
   (THD), increased reliability, and design flexibility due to the modular
   nature of the converter {[}1] and {[}2]. This topology is composed of a
   ``full-bridge converter{''} (FBC) connected to multiple ``High Frequency
   Link{''} (HFL) modules via high frequency transformers. Each module
   produces its own isolated DC voltage that keeps the capacitor charged to
   a specific level, removing the need of a voltage-balancing algorithm.
   Furthermore the module voltage can be controlled by changing the FBC
   duty cycle in order to obtain lower output voltages without decreasing
   the number of levels. This topology fits well in large scale
   Photovoltaic (PV) power plants due to its capability to produce a high
   voltage output. This topology's feasibility is validated by simulation
   results (Matlab/Simulink).}},

Abstract = {{Translationally oscillating blades, called agitators, can be used to
   thoroughly mix the flow inside heat exchanger channels such as those in
   an electronics module heat sink. Generally, throughflow is provided with
   an induction fan. Agitation is implemented inside the channel by using
   either multiple agitator blades, agitator blades with notched edges,
   full-length long-blade agitators or short-blade agitators. The power
   needed to drive the agitator blades is dependent on the agitation
   velocity, geometry and mass. The performance features of a 50min long
   agitator blade operating at an oscillation frequency of 500Hz, a 15mm
   short agitator blade operating at a frequency of 1000Hz, and two blades
   of length 15mm operating at a frequency of 500 Hz have been compared.
   Also, runs with other geometric changes, like those with added notches
   at the tip of the agitator, are made to explore their benefits. The
   intent is that the notches generate additional vorticity at the channel
   inlet, which is convected downstream enhancing heat transfer as it
   passes. Thus, this study numerically finds directions toward optimal
   agitator configurations and geometries that would give heat transfer
   augmentation without excessive power input. It was found that a multiple
   agitator blade configuration containing two short blade agitators
   operating at frequency 500Hz gives the best performance in terms of heat
   transfer augmentation when power consumption is considered. Heat flux
   plots on the channel wall and turbulence kinetic energy plots within the
   channel have been used to explain the mechanisms of heat transfer
   augmentation for the various cases.}},

Abstract = {{The present study presents a one-dimensional liquid-piston compressor
   model with an embedded two-dimensional submodel. The submodel is for
   calculating heat conduction across a representative internal plate of a
   porous heat exchanger matrix within the compression space. The
   liquid-piston compressor is used for Compressed Air Energy Storage
   (CAES). Porous-media-type heat exchangers are inserted in the compressor
   to absorb heat from air as it is compressed. Compression without heat
   transfer typically results in a temperature rise of a gas and a drop in
   efficiency, for the elevated temperature leads to wasted thermal energy,
   due to cooling during subsequent cooling back to ambient temperature.
   The use of heat exchangers can reduce the air temperature rise during
   the compression period.
   A typical numerical model of a heat exchanger is a one-dimensional
   simplification of the two-energy-equation porous media model. The
   present authors proposed a one-dimensional model that incorporates the
   Volume of Fluid (VOF) method for application to the two-phase flow,
   liquid piston compressor with exchanger inserts. Important to
   calculating temperature distributions in both the solid and fluid
   components of the mixture is heat transfer between the two, which
   depends on the local temperature values, geometry, and the velocity of
   fluid through the matrix. In the one-dimensional model, although the
   axial temperatures vary, the solid is treated as having a uniform
   temperature distribution across the plate at any axial location. This
   may be in line with the physics of flow in most heat exchangers,
   especially when the exchangers are made of metal with high thermal
   conductivity. However, it must be noted that for application to CAES,
   the gas temperature in the compression chamber rises rapidly. during
   compression and the core of the solid wall may heat up to a different
   temperature than that of the surface, depending on the geometry, solid
   material of the exchanger and fluid flow situation. Therefore, a new,
   one-dimensional model with embedded two-dimensional submodel is
   developed to consider two-dimensional heat conduction in a
   representative solid plate. The VOF concept is used in the model to
   handle the moving liquid-gas interface (liquid piston).
   The model gives accurate solutions of temperature distributions in the
   liquid piston compression chamber. Six different heat exchangers with
   different length scales and different materials are simulated and
   compared.}},

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was performed with R22 and R410a for
   single-phase flow, evaporation and condensation inside five micro-fin
   tubes of various geometries to obtain pressure drop and heat transfer
   characteristics. The results suggest single-phase flow heat transfer
   coefficients are increased by 46\% to 64\% compared with smooth tubes
   values. Tube geometries that had higher evaporation heat transfer
   coefficients or higher condensation heat transfer coefficients were
   identified. Condensation pressure drop characteristics also varied with
   tube geometry. Based on experiment data, a new correlation which
   contains the characteristics of a liquid film in annular flow is
   established. The new correlation can predict the experimental data
   within an error band of 15\% and, for 77\% of the data from the
   literature, within an error band of 30\%. The Choi et al. correlation

Abstract = {{In this experiment, agitation is used in a rectangular channel for
   convective heat transfer enhancement. The channel under study is
   representative of a flow channel in an electronics cooling finned heat
   sink module. It is open at one end and has a translationally oscillating
   plate within it that agitates the flow. Contrary to the heat sink
   cooling channel, the test channel has no net through-flow so that
   agitation, isolated from throughflow effects, is studied. The channel is
   divided into three regions. The entry region is close to the open end of
   the channel. This would be near the fin tips in the finned heat
   exchanger channel. The base region is close to the other end of the
   channel where the flow makes an abrupt U-bend around the agitator plate.
   This is near the fin base region of a finned channel of a heat sink heat
   exchanger. The central region is between the two. Each region has
   special flow and convective heat transfer features for study. Ensemble
   -averaged velocities and RMS fluctuations of velocity are measured over
   the cycle. Measured data lend insight into the mixing phenomena in each
   region over the oscillation cycle. Unsteady heat flux measurements were
   made in each region and over the cycle to help in understanding the
   mechanisms affecting heat transfer. The unsteady heat flux
   characteristics in the entry and base regions seem to be more influenced
   by the RMS fluctuations of velocity, indicating that heat transfer in
   these regions is governed by turbulence generated by agitation. The
   unsteady heat flux trends in the central region seem to be more
   influenced by acceleration/deceleration of the flow than by
   turbulence-like structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes expected link delay (i.e., data delivery delay) on a
   two-way road segment for carry-and-forward data delivery schemes in
   vehicular networks. Recently, a lot of vehicles are able to communicate
   with each other by dedicate short-range communications (DSRC) for
   vehicular networking. In the near future, more vehicles will be equipped
   with DSRC devices because of governmental policies for driving safety.
   In this paper, we derive link delay model on a two-way road segment.
   This link delay model is essential to support multihop
   infrastructure-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-vehicle data delivery in
   vehicular networks as disruption tolerant networks. Through simulation,
   it is shown that our two-way link delay model is more accurate than the
   legacy two-way link delay model.}},

Abstract = {{We present a technique for high-speed imaging of the dynamic thermal
   deformation of transparent substrates under high-power laser
   irradiation. Traditional thermal sensor arrays are not fast enough to
   capture thermal decay events. Our system adapts a Mach-Zender
   interferometer, along with a high-speed camera to capture phase images
   on sub-millisecond time-scales. These phase images are related to
   temperature by thermal expansion effects and by the change of refractive
   index with temperature. High power continuous-wave and long-pulse laser
   damage often hinges on thermal phenomena rather than the field-induced
   effects of ultra-short pulse lasers. Our system was able to measure such
   phenomena. We were able to record 2D videos of 1 ms thermal deformation
   waves, with 6 frames per wave, from a 100 ns, 10 mJ Q-switched Nd:YAG
   laser incident on a yttria-coated glass slide. We recorded thermal
   deformation waves with peak temperatures on the order of 100 degrees
   Celsius during non-destructive testing}},

Abstract = {{The laser damage behavior of high quality coatings under nanosecond
   pulse illumination is controlled by statistically distributed defects,
   whose physical nature and defect mechanisms are still largely unknown.
   Defect densities are often retrieved by modeling the fluence dependence
   of the damage probability measured by traditional damage test (TDT)
   methods, based on `damage' or `no damage' observations. STEREO-LID
   (Spatio-TEmporally REsolved Optical Laser-Induced Damage) allows the
   determination of the damage fluence (and intensity) in a single test by
   identifying the initiation of damage both temporally and spatially. The
   advantages of this test method over the TDT are discussed. In
   particular, its ability to retrieve detailed defect distribution
   functions is demonstrated by comparison of results from HfO2 films
   prepared by ion-assisted electron beam evaporation, ion-beam sputtering,
   and atomic layer deposition.}},

Title = {{Thalamocortical relationship in epileptic patients with generalized
   spike and wave discharges - A multimodal neuroimaging study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{117-127}},
Abstract = {{Unlike focal or partial epilepsy, which has a confined range of
   influence, idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) often affects the whole
   or a larger portion of the brain without obvious, known cause. It is
   important to understand the underlying network which generates epileptic
   activity and through which epileptic activity propagates. The aim of the
   present study was to investigate the thalamocortical relationship using
   non-invasive imaging modalities in a group of IGE patients. We
   specifically investigated the roles of the mediodorsal nuclei in the
   thalami and the medial frontal cortex in generating and spreading IGE
   activities. We hypothesized that the connectivity between these two
   structures is key in understanding the generation and propagation of
   epileptic activity in brains affected by IGE. Using three imaging
   techniques of EEG, fMRI and EEG-informed fMRI, we identified important
   players in generation and propagation of generalized spike-and-wave
   discharges (GSWDs). EEG-informed fMRI suggested multiple regions
   including the medial frontal area near to the anterior cingulate cortex,
   mediodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, caudate nucleus among others that
   related to the GSWDs. The subsequent seed-based fMRI analysis revealed a
   reciprocal cortical and bi-thalamic functional connection. Through
   EEG-based Granger Causality analysis using (DTF) and adaptive DTF,
   within the reciprocal thalamocortical circuitry, thalamus seems to serve
   as a stronger source in driving cortical activity from initiation to the
   propagation of a GSWD. Such connectivity change starts before the GSWDs
   and continues till the end of the slow wave discharge. Thalamus,
   especially the mediodorsal nuclei, may serve as potential targets for
   deep brain stimulation to provide more effective treatment options for
   patients with drug-resistant generalized epilepsy. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Catheter ablation is associated with limited success rates in patients
   with persistent atrial fibrillation (AF), which is mostly maintained by
   rotors that are located outside of pulmonary veins (PV) region. None of
   the currently available commercial mapping systems can accurately
   predict the rotor location outside of PV in patients with persistent AF.
   Experimental verification of the feasibility of using Shannon entropy
   (SE) based mapping technique based on symbolic dynamics approach to
   identify pivotal points of rotors in isolated rabbit hearts was
   performed. This mapping approach was applied to clinical intracardiac
   electrograms from a patient with persistent AF to construct a
   3-dimensional (3D) SE map.
   Our results demonstrate that SE can correctly predict the pivot point of
   the rotor in animal model. We also demonstrated the feasibility of
   generating 3D SE maps using current catheter mapping methods to identify
   active rotor sites that may maintain AF. Higher SE areas are noted at
   the base of right atrial appendage. Further clinical studies are needed
   to validate ablation of areas with high SE with outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{We study the impact of different encoding models and spectro-temporal
   representations on the accuracy of Bayesian decoding of neural activity
   recorded from the central auditory system. Two encoding models, a
   generalized linear model (GLM) and a generalized bilinear model (GBM),
   are compared along with three different spectro-temporal representations
   of the input stimuli: a spectrogram and two bio-inspired
   representations, i.e. a gammatone filter bank (GFB) and a spikegram.
   Signal to noise ratios between the reconstructed and original
   representations are used to evaluate the decoding, or reconstruction
   accuracy. We experimentally show that the reconstruction accuracy is
   best with the spikegram representation and worst with the spectrogram
   representation and, furthermore, that using a GBM instead of a GLM
   significantly increases the reconstruction accuracy. In fact, our
   results show that the spikegram reconstruction accuracy with a GBM
   fitting yields an SNR that is 3.3 dB better than when using the standard
   decoding approach of reconstructing a spectrogram with GLM fitting.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasion-induced insulation breach is a common failure mode of
   silicone-body, transvenous, implantable cardioverter defibrillator
   leads. It is caused either by external compression or internal motion of
   conducting cables. The present method of monitoring lead integrity
   measures low frequency conductor impedance. It cannot detect insulation
   failures until both the silicone lead body and inner fluoropolymer
   insulation have been breached completely, exposing conductors directly
   to blood or tissue. Even then the resistance changes are usually swamped
   by the baseline values. Thus the first clinical presentation may be
   either failure to deliver a life-saving shock or painful, inappropriate
   shocks in normal rhythm. We have previously presented a method for
   identifying early lead failure based on high frequency transmission line
   impedance measurements. That work used fresh leads in a liquid
   simulation bath; we have now demonstrated similar effects in leads
   soaked for 32 days and hence with saline-saturated silicone lead bodies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel patient-specific algorithm for prediction of
   seizures in epileptic patients with low hardware complexity and low
   power consumption. In the proposed approach, we first compute the
   spectrogram of the input fragmented EEG signals from a few electrodes.
   Each fragmented data clip is ten minutes in duration. Band powers,
   relative spectral powers and ratios of spectral powers are extracted as
   features. The features are then subjected to electrode selection and
   feature selection using classification and regression tree. The baseline
   experiment uses all features from selected electrodes and these features
   are then subjected to a radial basis function kernel support vector
   machine (RBF-SVM) classifier. The proposed method further selects a
   small number features from the selected electrodes and train a
   polynomial support vector machine (SVM) classifier with degree of 2 on
   these features. Prediction performances are compared between the
   baseline experiment and the proposed method. The algorithm is tested
   using intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) from the American Epilepsy Society
   Seizure Prediction Challenge database. The baseline experiment using a
   large number of features and RBF-SVM achieves a 100\% sensitivity and an
   average AUC of 0.9985, while the proposed algorithm using only a small
   number of features and polynomial SVM with degree of 2 can achieve a
   sensitivity of 100.0\%, an average area under curve (AUC) of 0.9795. For
   both experiments, only 10\% of the available training data are used for

Abstract = {{Cardiac restitution is the shortening of the action potential duration
   with an increase in the heart rate. A shorter action potential duration
   enables a longer diastolic interval which ensures that the heart gets
   adequate time to refill with blood. At higher rates however, restitution
   becomes steep and thus, can lead to unstable electrical activity
   (alternans) in the heart, leading to fatal cardiac rhythms. It has been
   proposed that maintaining a shallow slope of cardiac restitution could
   have potentially anti-arrhythmic effects. Previous studies involved the
   control of action potential duration (APD) or diastolic interval (DI) in
   isolated tissue samples based on the feedback from single microelectrode
   recordings. This limited the spatial resolution of the feedback system.
   Here, we aimed to develop a real time feedback control system that
   enabled the detection of APDs from various single pixels based on
   optical mapping recordings. Stimuli were applied after a predefined
   fixed DI after detection of an APD. We validated our algorithm using
   optical mapping movies from an ex-vivo rabbit heart. Thus, we provide an
   optical mapping based approach for the control of cardiac restitution
   and a potential means to validate its anti-arrhythmic effects.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum leasing in cognitive radio networks (CRNs) allows the primary
   network (PN) to lease a certain fraction of its licensed bandwidth to
   the secondary network (SN). The motivation for such a concept is to
   enhance the performance of SNs while improving channel utilization.
   Meanwhile, the license owners of the channels can also gain benefits
   through spectrum leasing in terms of either monetary rewards or
   cooperative communications. In this paper, we propose three dynamic
   channel access strategies for spectrum leasing in multichannel CRNs. A
   common characteristic of all these strategies is that the priority for
   channel access over the leased spectrum is given to SNs and the unleased
   spectrum to PNs respectively. The distinction among these three
   strategies is at the level of opportunistic or exclusive access to
   leased and unleased spectra by an SN or a PN. The performance of the
   proposed strategies is evaluated and compared with each other in terms
   of several system centric metrics including capacity, blocking
   probability, forced termination probability and channel utilization
   efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Pinterest is a popular social networking site that lets people discover,
   collect, and share pictures of items from the Web. Among popular social
   media sites, Pinterest has by far the most skewed gender distribution:
   women are four times more likely than men to use it. To better
   understand this, we examined two factors that generally affect whether
   people try a social site and whether they continue using it: the
   external perception of a site (e.g., as conveyed in popular media) and
   the site's initial user experience. For the latter, we focused on the
   role of social bootstrapping, importing contacts from one social site to
   another. We conducted a survey study, finding that: perceptions of
   Pinterest among users and non-users of the site differed significantly;
   trying Pinterest led to substantial changes in user perceptions of the
   site; social bootstrapping affected users' initial impression of
   Pinterest, generally improving it for women and harming it for men. We
   present implications of our findings for design and research.}},

Abstract = {{Small Group evolution has been of central importance in social sciences
   and also in the industry for understanding dynamics of team formation.
   While most of research works studying groups deal at a macro level with
   evolution of arbitrary size communities, in this paper we restrict
   ourselves to studying evolution of small group (size <= 20) which is
   governed by contrasting sociological phenomenon. Given a previous
   history of group collaboration between a set of actors, we address the
   problem of predicting likely future group collaborations. Unfortunately,
   predicting groups requires choosing from ((n)(r)) possibilities (where r
   is group size and n is total number of actors), which becomes
   computationally intractable as group size increases. However, our
   statistical analysis of a real world dataset has shown that two
   processes: an external actor joining an existing group (incremental
   accretion (IA)) or collaborating with a subset of actors of an exiting
   group (subgroup accretion (SA)), are largely responsible for future
   group formation. This helps to drastically reduce the ((n)(r))
   possibilities. We therefore, model the attachment of a group for
   different actors outside this group. In this paper, we have built three
   topology based prediction models to study these phenomena. The
   performance of these models is evaluated using extensive experiments
   over DBLP dataset. Our prediction results shows that the proposed models
   are significantly useful for future group predictions both for IA and
   SA.}},

Abstract = {{Determining and detecting risk markers for mental illness remains a
   labor intensive process, requiring vast amounts of observations by
   clinical professionals. Motor stereotypies, which are defined as
   involuntary repetitive motor behaviors, invariant in form, that, to an
   observer, appear to serve no purpose, are a class of risk markers which
   are very amenable to video analysis. These behaviors are associated with
   mental illnesses such as Autism, Rett Syndrome, and other developmental
   disabilities.
   This paper investigates the application of innovative automated methods
   to recognize these subtle motor indicators. To train and test our
   methods, a dataset of actions resembling motor stereotypies was created
   by engaging the normally developing children at the University of
   Minnesota's Shirley G. Moore Laboratory School. Comparison to a publicly
   available dataset depicting a subset of behaviors is performed as well.
   This work demonstrates the applicability of various techniques in the
   behavioral science domain. The results show that these techniques can
   perform well on a difficult and challenging real-world scenario.}},

Abstract = {{The continuously growing need for increasing the production of food and
   reducing the degradation of water supplies, has led to the development
   of several precision agriculture systems over the past decade so as to
   meet the needs of modern societies. The present study describes a
   methodology for the detection and characterization of Nitrogen (N)
   deficiencies in corn fields. Current methods of field surveillance are
   either completed manually or with the assistance of satellite imaging,
   which offer infrequent and costly information to the farmers about the
   state of their fields. The proposed methodology promotes the use of
   small-scale Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and Computer Vision
   algorithms that operate with information in the visual (RGB) spectrum.
   Through this implementation, a lower cost solution for identifying N
   deficiencies is promoted. We provide extensive results on the use of
   commercial RGB sensors for delivering the essential information to
   farmers regarding the condition of their field, targeting the reduction
   of N fertilizers and the increase of the crop performance. Data is first
   collected by a UAV that hovers over a stressed area and collects high
   resolution RGB images at a low altitude. A recommendation algorithm
   identifies potential segments of the images that are candidates
   exhibiting N deficiency. Based on the feedback from experts in the area
   a training set is constructed utilizing the initial suggestions of the
   recommendation algorithm. Supervised learning methods are then used to
   characterize crop leaves that exhibit signs of N deficiency. The
   performance of 84.2\% strongly supports the potential of this scheme to
   identify N-deficient leaves even in the case of images where the
   unhealthy leaves are heavily occluded by other healthy or stressed
   leaves.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing interest in data-analytic modeling for prediction
   and/or detection of epileptic seizures from EEG recording of brain
   activity {[}1-10]. Even though there is clear evidence that many
   patients have changes in EEG signal prior to seizures, development of
   robust seizure prediction methods remains elusive {[}1]. We argue that
   the main issue for development of effective EEG-based predictive models
   is an apparent disconnect between clinical considerations and
   data-analytic modeling assumptions. We present an SVM-based system for
   seizure prediction, where design choices and performance metrics are
   clearly related to clinical objectives and constraints. This system
   achieves very accurate prediction of preictal and interictal EEG
   segments in dogs with naturally occurring epilepsy. However, our
   empirical results suggest that good prediction performance may be
   possible only if the training data set has sufficiently many preictal
   segments, i.e. at least 6-7 seizure episodes.}},

   more recently IUSE (Improving Undergraduate STEM Education). In 2014 NSF
   funded a pilot implementation of the NSF Innovation Corps for Learning
   (I-Corps T L) and additional cohorts have been conducted and are
   planned. The growth of interest in the scholarship of teaching and
   learning (SoTL) has great potential to contribute to EER and EEI as
   indicated by the response to the ASEE Virtual Communities of Practice
   (VCP) project. Faculty and graduate students interested in engineering
   education research and innovation (EER\&I) are widely distributed and
   often isolated in their department and institution. Many are eager to
   meet and interact with colleagues who have similar interests. This
   session provides the opportunity to for people who have been involved in
   engineering education research and innovation to reconnect, and to
   welcome new folks into this emerging community.}},

Abstract = {{Integrated circuit chips fabricated using nano-scale CMOS technologies
   will be prone to errors caused by fluctuations in threshold voltage,
   supply voltage, electromigration, random dopant fluctuations, aging,
   timing errors and soft errors. Design of nano-scale failure-resistant
   systems has drawn significant interest in past few years. One common
   approach to reducing errors is the use of triple modular redundancy
   (TMR). The hardware overhead associated with TMR is significantly high.
   This paper presents a novel partial triple modular redundancy (PTMR)
   approach that achieves the same or better fault-tolerance as that of TMR
   but with significantly less hardware overhead. In a weighted number
   system, the most significant bits carry greater weight and preserving
   these bits is more critical than the lower significant bits. In PTMR,
   only the P most significant bits of the result are computed using TMR as
   opposed to all the W bits, where W represents the word-length of the
   operands. The proposed PTMR approach is illustrated in the context of a
   ripple-carry adder. It is shown that the hardware overhead can be
   reduced by 75\% to 87.5\% with P = 4 as the word-length varies from 16
   to 32, with average error power equal to or less than that of TMR. It is
   shown that P = 3 or 4 is sufficient for word-lengths varying from 16 to
   32.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes have emerged as the most favorable channel codes for their
   unique capacity-achieving property. To date, numerous approaches for
   efficient decoding of polar codes have been reported. However, these
   prior efforts focused on design of polar decoders via deterministic
   computation, while the behavior of stochastic polar decoder, which can
   have potential advantages such as low complexity and strong
   error-resilience, has not been studied in existing literatures. This
   paper, for the first time, investigates polar decoding using stochastic
   logic. Specifically, the commonly-used successive cancellation (SC)
   algorithm is reformulated into the stochastic form. Several methods that
   can potentially improve decoding performance are discussed and analyzed.
   Simulation results show that a stochastic SC decoder can achieve similar
   error-correcting performance as its deterministic counterpart. This work
   can pave the way for future hardware design of stochastic polar codes
   decoders.}},

Abstract = {{Analytic methods to quantify power systems stability margins while
   acknowledging uncertainty will be critical in dynamic security
   assessment due to the integration of renewable resources and
   uncontrollable loads. Lyapunov's direct method provides a mathematical
   framework to assess stability margins. However, analytical construction
   of Lyapunov functions are limited to very restrictive settings and
   cannot be extended to accommodate the impact of uncertainty. This paper
   focuses on the algorithmic construction of Lyapunov functions and the
   estimation of the robust Region-Of-Attraction (ROA) with sum-of-squares
   (SOS) optimization programs which can be translated into semidefinite
   problems and then solved with readily available software. Key to the
   proposed approach is the formulation of computationally tractable
   polynomial differential equation models that are affine in
   parametric/input uncertainty. Numerical case studies for a prototypical
   power system model validate the accuracy of the polynomial
   approximations and compare the ROA and the robust ROA with results from
   repeated time-domain simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Safe, intuitive human-robot interaction requires that robots
   intelligently interface with their environments, ideally sensing and
   localizing physical contact across their link surfaces. We introduce a
   stretchable smart skin sensor that provides this function.
   Stretchability allows it to conform to arbitrary robotic link surfaces.
   It senses contact over nearly the entire surface, localizes contact
   position of a typical finger touch continuously over its entire surface
   (RMSE = 7.02mm for a 14.7cm x 14.7cm area), and provides an estimate of
   the contact force. Our approach exclusively employs stretchable,
   flexible materials resulting in skin strains of up to 150\%. We exploit
   novel carbon nanotube elastomers to create a two-dimensional
   potentiometer surface. Finite element simulations validate a simplified
   polynomial surface model to enable real-time processing on a basic
   microcontroller with no supporting electronics. Using only five
   electrodes, the skin can be scaled up to arbitrary sizes without needing
   additional electrodes. We designed, implemented, calibrated, and tested
   a prototype smart skin as a tactile sensor on a custom medical robot for
   sensing unexpected physical interactions. We experimentally demonstrate
   its utility in collaborative robotic applications by showing its
   potential to enable safer, more intuitive human-robot interaction.}},

   coverage of arbitrary environments for different missions. In this work,
   we propose an anytime approach for creating multi-robot patrolling

   Search (MCTS) to allow robots to have life-long, cyclic policies so as
   to provide continual coverage of an environment. Our proposed method can
   generate near-optimal policies for a team of robots for small
   environments in real-time (and in larger environments in under a
   minute). By incorporating additional planning heuristics we are able to
   plan coordinated patrolling paths for teams of several robots in large

Abstract = {{We introduce the problem of navigating a group of robots having
   prioritized formations amidst static and dynamic obstacles. Our
   formulation allows users to define a number of template formations, each
   with a specified priority value. At each planning cycle, we compute a
   new formation which accounts for both these priority values and the safe
   progress of the robots towards their goal. To this end, we introduce a
   new velocity-based navigation approach which we denote as Formation
   Velocity Obstacles (FVO). Like other velocity-based approaches, FVO
   allows anticipatory collision avoidance accounting for the likely future
   motion of nearby obstacles. However, we extend these previous approaches
   and allow anisotropic agents which rotate themselves to orient along
   their direction of travel. We integrate these FVOs with a Bayesian
   framework to infer priority values for arbitrary formations from the
   user-given templates. The result is a complete framework for prioritized
   formation planning.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an Iterative Kalman Smoother (IKS) for
   tracking the 3D motion of a mobile device in real-time using visual and
   inertial measurements. In contrast to existing Extended Kalman Filter
   (EKF)-based approaches, smoothing can better approximate the underlying
   nonlinear system and measurement models by re-linearizing them.
   Additionally, by iteratively optimizing over all measurements available,
   the IKS increases the convergence rate of critical parameters (e.g.,
   IMU-camera clock drift) and improves the positioning accuracy during
   challenging conditions (e.g., scarcity of visual features). Furthermore,
   and in contrast to existing inverse filters, the proposed IKS's
   numerical stability allows for efficient 32-bit implementations on
   resource-constrained devices, such as cell phones and wearables. We
   validate the IKS for performing vision-aided inertial navigation on
   Google Glass, a wearable device with limited sensing and processing, and
   demonstrate positioning accuracy comparable to that achieved on cell
   phones. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first

Abstract = {{Practical implementations of the power electronics required to operate

   use the same coils to produce both radial suspension forces and torque,
   which has been shown in the literature to enable better machine
   performance. In this paper, the use of two-level inverters is
   investigated for the two configurations of DPNV windings: the
   ``parallel{''} and ``bridge{''} configurations. The investigation is
   valid for conventional p +/- 1 pole-pair bearingless motors (i.e.
   bearingless permanent magnet and induction motors) and p = 1 bearingless
   motors (bearingless ac homopolar and consequent-pole motors). The
   advantages and disadvantages of each configuration are explored in terms

Abstract = {{The growing variability in nanoelectronic devices, due to uncertainties
   from the manufacturing process and environmental conditions (power
   supply, temperature, aging), requires increasing design guardbands,
   forcing circuits to work with conservative clock frequencies. Various
   schemes for clock generation based on ring oscillators and adaptive
   clocks have been proposed with the goal to mitigate the power and
   performance losses attributable to variability. However, there has been
   no systematic analysis to quantify the benefits of such schemes and no
   sign-off method has been proposed for timing correctness. This paper
   presents and analyzes a Reactive Clocking scheme with
   Variability-Tracking Jitter (RClk) that uses variability as an
   opportunity to reduce power by continuously adjusting the clock
   frequency to the varying environmental conditions, and thus, reduces
   guardband margins significantly. Power can be reduced between 20\% and
   40\% at iso-performance and performance can be boosted by similar
   amounts at iso-power. Additionally, energy savings can be translated to
   substantial advantages in terms of reliability and thermal management.
   More importantly, the technology can be adopted with minimal
   modifications to conventional EDA flows.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic Computing (SC) is a digital computation approach that
   operates on random bit streams to perform complex tasks with much
   smaller hardware footprints compared to conventional approaches that
   employ binary radix. For stochastic logic to work, the input random bit
   streams have to be independent, which is a challenge when implementing
   systems with feedback: outputs that are generated based on input bit
   streams would be correlated to those streams and cannot be readily
   combined as inputs to stochastic logic for another iteration of the
   function. We propose rerandomization techniques for stochastic computing
   and use the Logistic Map x -> r x(1-x) as a case study for dynamical
   systems in general. We show that complex behaviors such as period
   doubling and chaos do indeed occur in digital logic with only a few
   gates operating on a few 0's and 1's. We employ a number of techniques
   such as random number generator sharing and using tablelookup
   precomputations to significantly reduce the total energy of the
   computation. Compared to the conventional binary approach, we achieve
   between 8\% and 25\% energy consumption.}},

Abstract = {{Determining the induced L-2 norm of a linear, parameter-varying (LPV)
   system is an integral part of many analysis and robust control design
   procedures. In general, this norm cannot be determined explicitly. Most
   prior work has focused on efficiently computing upper bounds for the
   induced L-2 norm. This paper presents a complementary algorithm to
   compute lower bounds for this norm. The proposed approach is based on
   restricting the parameter trajectory to be a periodic signal. This
   restriction enables the use of recent results for exact calculation of
   the L-2 norm for a periodic time varying system. The proposed lower
   bound algorithm has two benefits. First, the lower bound complements
   standard upper bound techniques. Specifically, a small gap between the
   bounds indicates that further computation, e. g. upper bounds with more
   complex Lyapunov functions, is unnecessary. Second, the lower bound
   algorithm returns a worst-case parameter trajectory for the LPV system
   that can be further analyzed to provide insight into the system
   performance. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the
   applicability of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers the analysis of the worst-case input/output gain of
   an interconnection of a known linear parameter varying system and a
   perturbation. The input/output behavior of the perturbation is described
   by an integral quadratic constraint (IQC). Recent results have shown
   that under certain technical conditions IQCs can be formulated as a
   finite horizon time domain constraint. The worst-case input/output gain
   of the interconnection can then be bounded using a dissipation
   inequality that incorporates the IQCs. Unlike the classical frequency
   domain approach to IQCs, this time domain interpretation opens up a new
   class of IQCs, where the IQC itself is parameter-varying. Various
   examples for parameter-varying IQCs for different classes of
   perturbations are given. A simple numerical example shows that the
   introduction of parameter-varying IQCs can lead to less conservative
   bounds on the worst-case gain.}},

Abstract = {{Second-order statistics of nonlinear dynamical systems can be obtained
   from experiments or numerical simulations. These statistics are relevant
   in understanding the fundamental physics, e. g., of fluid flows, and are
   useful for developing low-complexity models. Such models can be used for
   the purpose of control design and analysis. In many applications, only
   certain second-order statistics of a limited number of states are
   available. Thus, it is of interest to complete partially specified
   covariance matrices in a way that is consistent with the linearized
   dynamics. The dynamics impose structural constraints on admissible
   forcing correlations and state statistics. Solutions to such completion
   problems can be used to obtain stochastically driven linearized models.
   Herein, we address the covariance completion problem. We introduce an
   optimization criterion that combines the nuclear norm together with an
   entropy functional. The two, together, provide a numerically stable and
   scalable computational approach which is aimed at low complexity
   structures for stochastic forcing that can account for the observed
   statistics. We develop customized algorithms based on alternating
   direction methods that are well-suited for large scale problems.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers a general approach for gain scheduling of Lipschitz
   continuous nonlinear systems. The approach is based on a linear
   parameter varying system (LPV) representation of the nonlinear dynamics
   along with integral quadratic constraints (IQC) to account for the
   linearization errors. Past results have shown that Jacobian
   linearization leads to hidden coupling terms in the controlled system.
   These terms arise due to neglecting the higher order terms of the Taylor
   series and due to the use of constant (frozen) values of the scheduling
   parameter. This paper proposes an LPV control synthesis method that
   accounts for these shortcomings. The higher order terms of the
   linearization are treated as a memoryless uncertainty whose input/output
   behavior is described by a parameter varying IQC. It is also shown that
   if the rate of the scheduling parameter is measurable then it can be
   treated as a known disturbance in the control synthesis step. A simple
   numerical example shows that the proposed control design approach leads
   to improved control performance.}},

   oscillators. The general strategy of controlling inverters to emulate
   the behavior of Lienard-type oscillators is termed Virtual Oscillator
   Control (VOC), and it presents a compelling time-domain alternative to
   ubiquitous droop control methods which linearly trade off voltage
   frequencies and magnitudes with active and reactive power injections. In
   comparison to droop control, which assumes a priori that the network
   operates in a quasi-stationary sinusoidal steady state, VOC is a
   time-domain control strategy that globally stabilizes a desired
   sinusoidal steady state. The main, and somewhat surprising, result of
   this paper is that-when reduced to the sinusoidal steady state-the VOC
   dynamics correspond to those of droop control. Hence, VOC is a globally
   stabilizing control strategy that can deal with higher-order harmonics
   and includes droop control in the harmonic steady state. The results are
   intriguing, in that they suggest that droop control laws can be
   recovered from averaging the complex dynamics of a class of weakly
   nonlinear limit-cycle oscillators.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic sensors and nonlinear models of magnetic fields (as functions
   of distance) can be used for position estimation in a number of
   real-world applications. However, disturbances from foreign
   ferromagnetic objects and from other spurious magnetic fields can cause
   significant errors in position estimates. This paper develops a
   disturbance compensation system based on redundant magnetic sensors and
   use of adaptive disturbance estimation algorithms. The developed
   disturbance compensation system is used for position estimation in a
   pneumatic cylinder application. Experimental results demonstrate that
   sub-mm accuracies can be obtained in position estimates, even in the
   presence of foreign ferromagnetic objects. The developed position
   estimation system can be used in a large number of industrial and mobile
   applications for piston position estimation tasks.}},

Abstract = {{previously, the authors have proposed the concept of piston
   trajectory-based homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI)
   combustion control enabled by a free piston engine and shown the effects
   of variable piston trajectories on the start of combustion timing, heat
   loss amount and indicated output work. In order to realize this new
   control in practical applications, a control-oriented model with reduced
   chemical kinetics has to be developed. In this paper, such a model is
   presented and is compared to two existing models: a simplified model
   using a global reaction and a complex model including detailed chemical
   reaction mechanisms. A cycle separation method is employed in the
   proposed model to significantly reduce the computational time and
   guarantee the prediction accuracy simultaneously. A feedback controller
   is also implemented on the control-oriented model to control the HCCI
   combustion phasing by varying the trajectories. The simulation results
   show that the combustion phasing can be adjusted as desired, which
   demonstrates the effectiveness of the piston trajectory-based combustion
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Contradicting the widely believed assumption of link independence,
   recently the phenomenon of reception correlation among nearby receivers
   has been revealed and exploited for varieties of protocols {[}3], {[}8],
   {[}17], {[}21], {[}23], {[}24]. However, despite the diversified
   correlation-aware designs proposed up to date, they commonly suffer from
   a shortcoming where link correlation is inaccurately measured, which
   leads them to sub-optimal performance. In this work we propose a general
   framework for accurate capturing of link correlation, enabling better
   utilization of the phenomenon for protocols lying on top of it. Our
   framework uses SINR (Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio) to detect
   correlations, followed by modeling the correlations for in-network use.
   We show that our design is light-weight, both computation and
   storage-wise. We apply our model to opportunistic routing and network
   coding on a physical 802.15.4 test-bed for energy savings of 25\% and
   15\%.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated the synthesis of kesterite Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) thin films
   using thermal evaporation from copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and tin (Sn)
   pellets and post-annealing in a sulfur atmosphere. Two different metal
   precursor stacking orders (Cu/Sn/Zn/Cu and Cu/Sn/Cu/Zn) have been tested
   and experimental results prove that a layer of Cu on the top provides
   higher compositional uniformity and fewer secondary phases. CZTS thin
   films produced by a Cu/Sn/Zn/Cu precursor stacking order was used to
   study post rapid thermal annealing (RTA) influence on solar cell
   performance. The best performing solar cell using the CZTS thin film
   mentioned above with composition ratio Cu/(Zn+Sn) = 0.82, and Zn/Sn =
   1.35 exhibited an open-circuit voltage of 433 mV, a short-circuit
   current of 7.78 mA/cm(2), a fill factor of 46.23 \% and a conversion
   efficiency of 1.56 \%. Post RTA was conducted and an increase of device
   performance was observed. The solar cell which shows 1.56 \% at room
   temperature shows 2.72 \% efficiency after RTA at 350 degrees C for 30
   seconds. The cell performance improvement mechanism was studied.}},

Abstract = {{A inverter based filter design is proposed that uses only MOSCAPs as
   filter capacitors. Further in the design the load capacitance
   compensates the negative feedback network allowing the majority of
   current to flow into the load. This results in an increase in the
   overall power efficiency. As a proof of concept, a 3rd order inverter
   based 34-314 MHz tunable continuous time channel select filter for
   software-defined radios is fabricated in TSMCs 65nm technology. By using
   the high density tunable MOSCAPs at a low swing node, the filter
   achieves an OIP3 of +25.24 dBm while drawing 4.2mA from a 1.1V supply
   and occupies an area of 0.007mm(2). The measured intermodulation
   distortion varies by 5dB across a 120 degrees variation in temperature
   and 6.5dB across a 200mV variation in power supply. Further, the filter
   presents a high impedance node at the input and a low impedance node at
   the output easing system integration.}},

Abstract = {{Interrupted-plate heat exchangers are used as regenerators for absorbing
   and releasing thermal energy such as in a Compressed Air Energy Storage
   (CAES) system in which the exchanger absorbs energy to cool the air
   being compressed or liberates energy to heat the air upon expansion. The
   exchanger consists of layers of thin plates in stacked arrays. In a
   given layer, the plates are parallel to one another and parallel to the
   exchanger axis. Each successive layer is rotated to have its plates be
   perpendicular to those of the layer below but still parallel to the
   exchanger axis. As flow passes from one layer to the next, new thermal
   boundary layers develop, beneficial to effective heat transfer. The
   interrupted-plate heat exchanger can also be seen as a porous medium. As
   such, it demonstrates strong anisotropic behavior when flow approaches
   the plates in a direction other than axially. Thus, pressure drops and
   heat transfer coefficients are dependent upon the attack angle.
   Mathematical models for anisotropic pressure drop and heat transfer
   behavior are proposed based on numerical calculations on a
   Representative Elementary Volume (REV), the unit cell model of the
   interrupted-plate medium. The anisotropic pressure drop is modeled by
   the traditionally used Darcy and inertial terms, with the addition of
   another term representing mixing effects. Heat transfer between the
   fluid and the plates is formulated in terms of Nusselt number vs.
   Reynolds number and approach angle of the mean flow. These models are
   used when solving, on the scale of the heat exchanger application, the
   volume-averaged Navier-Stokes equations that treat the exchanger region
   as a continuum. The analysis of the heat exchanger is used for design
   and optimization of the medium.}},

   collected at the Minnesota Road Research Facility. It was shown that a
   good match between the simulated and measured response data could be

Abstract = {{Source/drain stressors in FinFET-based circuits lose their effectiveness
   at smaller contacted gate pitches. To improve circuit performance, a
   dual gate pitch technique is proposed in this work, where standard cells
   with double the gate pitch are selectively used on the gates of the
   circuit critical paths, at minimal area and power costs. A stress-aware
   library characterization is performed for FinFET-based standard cells by
   obtaining stress distributions using finite element simulations on a
   subset of structures. The stresses are then employed to create look-up
   tables for mobility multipliers and threshold voltage shifts, for
   subsequent performance characterization of FinFET-based standard cells.
   Finally, a circuit delay optimizer is applied using the dual gate pitch
   approach and is compared with an alternative gate sizing approach. Using
   a combination of gate sizing and the dual gate pitch approach, it is
   shown that the average power delay product improves by 12.9\% and 15.9\%
   in 14nm and 10nm technologies, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes research efforts sponsored by the Minnesota
   Department of Transportation (DOT) to update its rigid design procedure
   to take advantage of locally calibrated mechanistic empirical models for
   performance and consequently design. The new procedure, MnPCC-ME, is
   based on the AASHTO Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG)
   Version 1.1, but restricts the user to predetermined design input
   parameters. MnPCC-ME matches the MEPDG predicted performance at a
   fraction of the computation cost. The user is able to modify key design
   inputs for state and local pavement projects; the parameters include
   district climate files and traffic load spectra files (based on
   historical Minnesota DOT weigh-in-motion data). In addition, MnPCC-ME
   provides alternative reliability analysis, which is based on a Monte
   Carlo simulation of pavement performance predictions based on typical
   variability in slab thickness and flexural strength for Minnesota
   pavements. The MnPCC-ME program requires virtually no run time and
   outputs a project report with the recommended design thickness for given
   performance criteria and reliability level for the specified reliability
   analysis. Although this tool was developed for Minnesota local
   conditions, the approach developed in the study can be adopted by other
   transportation agencies for their region and conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Large Eddy Simulation is employed to study two turbulent cavitating
   flows: over a cylinder and a wedge. A homogeneous mixture model is used
   to treat the mixture of water and water vapor as a compressible fluid.
   The governing equations are solved using a novel predictor corrector
   method. The subgrid terms are modeled using the Dynamic Smagorinsky
   model. Cavitating flow over a cylinder at Reynolds number (Re) = 3900
   and cavitation number (sigma) = 1.0 is simulated and the wake
   characteristics are compared to the single phase results at the same
   Reynolds number. It is observed that cavitation suppresses turbulence in
   the near wake and delays three dimensional breakdown of the vortices.
   Next, cavitating flow over a wedge at Re = 200, 000 and sigma = 2.0 is
   presented. The mean void fraction profiles obtained are compared to
   experiment and good agreement is obtained. Cavity auto oscillation is
   observed, where the sheet cavity breaks up into a cloud cavity
   periodically. The results suggest LES as an attractive approach for
   predicting turbulent cavitating flows.}},

Abstract = {{The present work reports some interesting experimental results for
   ventilated supercavitation in steady and unsteady flows. First, a
   variety of closure modes obtained as a result of systematic variation in
   Froude number and air entrainment, are reported. The closure mechanisms
   were found to differ from the standard criterion reported in the
   literature. Further, the occurrence of a variety of stable and unstable
   closure mechanisms were discovered that have not been reported in the
   literature. Next, a hypothesis is presented to explain the cause behind
   these different closure mechanisms. The proposed hypothesis is then
   validated by synchronized high-speed imaging and pressure measurements
   inside and outside of the supercavity. These measurements show that the
   supercavity closure is a function of instantaneous cavitation number
   under unsteady flow conditions. (Research sponsored by Office of Naval

Abstract = {{As a continuation of efforts to provide a common background and platform
   for development of calibration and validation (C/V) guidelines for
   hydrologic and water quality (H/WQ) modeling, ASABE members worked to
   determine critical topics related to model C/V, perform a synthesis of a
   previously published special collection of articles and other relevant
   literature, and provide topic-specific recommendations based on the
   synthesis as well as personal modeling expertise. This article
   introduces a special collection of nine research articles covering key
   topics related to calibration and validation of H/WQ models. The topics
   include: terminology, hydrologic processes and model representation,
   spatial and temporal scales, model parameterization, C/V strategies,
   sensitivity, uncertainty, performance measures and criteria, and
   documentation and reporting. The main objective of this introductory
   article is to introduce and summarize key aspects of these topics,
   including recommendations. Individually, the articles provide model
   practitioners with detailed topic-specific recommendations related to
   model calibration, validation, and use. Collectively, the articles
   present recommendations to enhance H/WQ modeling.}},

Abstract = {{The combination of high thermal conductivity and mechanical resilience
   makes carbon nanotubes and few-layer graphene interesting systems to
   investigate phonon scattering on the nonlinear structural buckling. This
   fundamental limit of heat transfer has not been so far detected, partly
   because of the extraordinary experimental difficulties encountered at
   this scale. Utilizing non-equilibrium molecular dynamics with classical
   inter-atomic potentials, we study thermal transport in severely bent
   single-wall carbon nanotube and bi-layer graphene structures. These bent
   structures were computed with atomistic-level calculations performed
   under objective boundary conditions, which allow imposing a pure bending
   moment. We show that at lengths much shorter than the mean free path,
   local buckling can significantly decrease the thermal conductivity. Our
   calculations provide guidance for the experimental lengths required to
   observe phonon-buckling scattering effect in these structures. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{P(VDF-TrFE) nanofilm is a critical component in many organic
   electronics. Here we report the irreversible degradation of its
   ferroelectricity due to medium-energy electron irradiation (<10 keV),
   which is commonly found in device fabrication and characterization
   tools. The first-order electromechanical coupling in P(VDF-TrFE) was
   directly measured by atomic force microscopy to study the
   ferroelectricity switching property. Results showed that P(VDF-TrFE)
   films became non-ferroelectric after metal deposition in an
   electron-beam evaporator or after two minutes of observation under a
   scanning electron microscope. Lowering the electron energy slowed down
   the degradation process, but 500 eV electrons were still detrimental to
   the film. Irradiation is believed to transform the all-trans polar phase
   of P(VDF-TrFE) into a non-polar state, as revealed by infrared
   spectroscopy. On the other hand, controlled electron irradiation allows
   us to create patterns on the ferroelectric P(VDF-TrFE) thin films at
   submicron spatial resolution.}},

   reduced to the inversion of a sparse linear algebraic system. The beam
   trajectories are subsequently corrected using an iterative ray trace
   procedure that continually refines the computed solution and the
   associated boundary values. We demonstrate our method in simulation by
   calculating the refractive index distribution of a hypothetical 2-D
   gradient-index element from computer-generated external beam deflection
   data, where RMS index errors below 1\% of the index range (n(max) -
   n(min)) are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{There is increasing interest in using a porous ceramisite as the filter
   medium for removing heavy metals from wastewater in China given its low
   cost, easy preparation, large available quantities, high mechanical
   strength, and good performance to remove various pollutants. In this
   study, bentonite, metallic iron (Fe-0), and activated carbon (AC) were
   used to prepare a Fe-0/AC-ceramisite (diameter 2-4 mm) by sintering at
   800 degrees C in a N-2 environment. The Fe-0/AC-ceramisite achieved a
   high Pb2+ removal efficiency (>99\%) at ceramisite dosages of 5-10 g
   L-1, an initial solution pH of 3.0-5.7, and initial Pb2+ concentrations
   of 50-200 mg L-1. Compared with three control ceramisites including
   B-ceramisite (made by bentonite only), AC-ceramisite (made by bentonite
   and AC), and Fe-0-ceramisite (made by bentonite and Fe0), the enhanced
   Pb2+ removal by the Fe-0/AC-ceramisite was mainly attributed to the
   iron-carbon micro-electrolysis induced by the addition of AC. A
   first-order kinetics model fit well for the Pb2+ removal by the
   Fe-0/AC-ceramisite, and the Pb2+ uptake rate increased linearly with the
   increasing initial solution pH. Results from scanning electron
   microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM/EDX),
   X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)
   indicated that the Pb2+ removal by the Fe-0/AC-ceramisite involved
   multiple mechanisms including sorption, reduction (from Pb2+ to Pb-0),
   and precipitation (in the forms of PbCO3 and Pb-3(CO3)(2)(OH)(2))}},

Abstract = {{This work examines the role of shear and extensional strain on
   immiscible blend morphology, namely domain size, orientation, and
   co-continuity. The domain size reduces with surface tension similar to
   what is observed with isolated droplets. The domain size is shown to
   increase with shear strain due to coalescence. Hence the best mixing is
   found with low shear strains, i.e. low rates of shear and short
   durations of time. Extensional strain (extrusion draw ratio DR) reduces
   phase width and thickness with a DR-0.5 dependence, suggesting the
   transformation to a fibrilar morphology. The critical draw ratio for
   morphology transformation is approximately 7, in agreement with
   observations by Grace for droplet breakup in elongation. Fibrilar
   morphology is also consistent with a large increase in strain-to-break
   in the drawn film and with observed creep and optical scattering
   behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The photostability of luminescent silicon quantum dots is critical for
   optoelectronic and photovoltaic applications. While nanocrystals
   synthesized in a nonthermal plasma and thermally-hydrosilylated with
   dodecyl groups exhibit quantum yields exceeding 60\%, their optical
   properties degrade with UV exposure. A 20\% (absolute) reduction in
   quantum yield was observed within 4 h of UV irradiation. The origin of
   instability was identified to stem from unpaired electrons generated at
   the nanocrystal surface as a result of the breaking of silicon hydride
   bonds. Recovery of the nanocrystals' quantum yield can be achieved by
   passivating the dangling bonds generated during photobleaching.
   Moreover, no degradation in optical properties was observed with further
   UV irradiation, indicating that photostable silicon nanocrystals were
   synthesized.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the feasibility of in vivo high resolution imaging
   of blood perfusion in the rat brain tissue using a dual-mode ultrasound
   array (DMUA). The DMUA is capable of generating therapeutic transcranial
   focused ultrasound (tFUS) beams as well as forming images of the target
   in synthetic-aperture (SA) mode. Low mechanical index (MI) SA frames are
   used to estimate the dynamic changes in perfusion, which could be used
   for guidance, monitoring, or damage assessment. We have previously
   demonstrated the advantages of the post-beamforming third-order Volterra
   filter in imaging nonlinear echo components due to UCA oscillations
   using diagnostic probes. In this study, we decompose the beamformed
   transcranial DMUA SA data into its linear, quadratic, and cubic
   components and evaluate a temporal perfusion index (TPI) to characterize
   perfusion. The data collection used a 3.2-MHz, concave (40-mm ROC) DMUA
   operating in SA mode at a frame rate of approximately 23 fps and in the
   low MI setting (about 0.05 to 0.11). The experiment was performed on
   healthy rats (250-300 grams). Targestar-P UCA (60 mu L in 140 mu L of
   sterile saline) was injected through the animal tail vein. Images from
   the linear, quadratic, and cubic components were formed as LB-mode,
   QB-mode and CB-mode, respectively. TPI image frames were computed from
   each image component after limiting the dynamic range appropriately. The
   results clearly show separation of TPI values and demonstrate the
   feasibility of high-resolution estimation of blood perfusion in rat
   brain transcranially.}},

Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{966-976}},
Abstract = {{Pleated electret HVAC filters are often used in residence to mitigate
   the particles that originate both indoors and outdoors. These filters
   are usually tested with particles larger than 300 nm. However,
   residential particles can contain a significant amount of nanoparticles
   with size below 50 nm due to cooking, smoking, cleaning, wood burning,
   and outdoor infiltration. In order to characterize the nanoparticle
   removal by electret HVAC filters, penetrations of 3-50 nm silver
   nanoparticles through five different flat sheet electret media used in
   commercial residential HVAC filters were tested with face velocities of
   0.05, 0.5, and 1.0 m s(-1). Experimental results showed that all media
   had significantly high penetrations with 0.35-0.8 at the most
   penetrating particle sizes (MPPSs) for all three velocities, which were
   in the sizes of 10-30 nm. A model based on single fiber theory for
   particle penetration predictions was used and compared with the
   experimental data. Results showed that the model predicted the
   nanoparticle penetrations very well for all media and all face
   velocities tested. According to the model, for enhancing the
   nanoparticle efficiency of the current commercial HVAC filters, the
   fiber diameter should be reduced or the number of pleats should be
   increased. However, by doing these, pressure drop and cost may be
   largely increased. On the other hand, this study found the existing
   commercial mechanical HVAC filters were much capable for sub-50 nm
   nanoparticle removal when their minimum efficiency reporting values
   (MERVs) were larger than 13 and it is concluded mechanical HVAC filters
   can do a better job than electret ones. However, the quality factor
   analysis showed electret filters could be regarded as the best filter
   media for removing particles smaller than 300 nm.}},

Abstract = {{This work introduces a method for the detection and triangulation of
   anomalous features in solid media. The strategy leverages an algorithm
   which demixes the dynamic system response data into two distinct
   components: the first characterized by spatially sparse, persistent
   features and the second comprising the relatively large, smooth features
   of the bulk response. In performing this demixing, we select a
   topologically suitable basis for each component and we seek an accurate
   representation of the data in terms of the respective bases. This task
   is cast in the form of a Group Lasso optimization problem and solved
   using a Block Coordinate Descent algorithmic approach. The resulting
   representation distills the signatures of potential anomalies from the
   bulk dynamic response, thus allowing an effortless determination of
   their location. The proposed method is baseline free, automated,
   unsupervised (it makes no use of training sets), and model agnostic (it
   makes virtually no use of material knowledge or constitutive behavior).
   These attributes are appealing in systems where there exists limited or
   unreliable a priori constitutive knowledge of the model, or when the
   physical domain is highly heterogeneous or compromised by large damage
   zones. The method is tested against synthetically generated data and
   experimental data obtained using a scanning laser Doppler vibrometer.}},

Abstract = {{Self-sensing carbon fiber reinforced composites have the potential to
   enable structural health monitoring that is inherent to the composite
   material rather than requiring external or embedded sensors. It has been
   demonstrated that a self-sensing carbon fiber reinforced polymer
   composite can be created by using the piezoelectric polymer
   polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) as the matrix material and using a
   Kevlar layer to separate two carbon fiber layers. In this configuration,
   the electrically conductive carbon fiber layers act as electrodes and
   the Kevlar layer acts as a dielectric to prevent the electrical shorting
   of the carbon fiber layers. This composite material has been
   characterized experimentally for its effective d(33) and d(31)
   piezoelectric coefficients. However, for design purposes, it is
   desirable to obtain a predictive model of the effective piezoelectric
   coefficients for the final smart composite material. Also, the inverse
   problem can be solved to determine the degree of polarization obtained
   in the PVDF material during polarization by comparing the effective
   d(33) and d(31) values obtained in experiment to those predicted by the
   finite element model. In this study, a coupled piezoelectric-mechanical
   finite element modeling approach is used to predict the mechanical and
   piezoelectric performance of a plain weave carbon fiber reinforced PVDF
   composite.}},

Abstract = {{Living cells are crowded with macromolecules and organelles. Yet, it is
   not fully understood how macromolecular crowding affects the myriad of
   biochemical reactions, transport and the structural stability of
   biomolecules that are essential to cellular function and survival. These
   molecular processes, with or without electrostatic interactions, in
   living cells are therefore expected to be distinct from those carried
   out in test tube in dilute solutions where excluded volumes are absent.
   Thus there is an urgent need to understand the macromolecular crowding
   effects on cellular and molecular biophysics towards quantitative cell
   biology. In this report, we investigated how biomimetic crowding affects
   both the rotational and translation diffusion of a small probe
   (rhodamine green, RhG). For biomimetic crowding agents, we used
   Ficoll-70 (synthetic polymer), bovine serum albumin and ovalbumin
   (proteins) at various concentrations in a buffer at room temperature. As
   a control, we carried out similar measurements on glycerol-enriched
   buffer as an environment with homogeneous viscosity as a function of
   glycerol concentration. The corresponding bulk viscosity was measured
   independently to test the validity of the Stokes-Einstein model of a
   diffusing species undergoing a random walk. For rotational diffusion
   (ps-ns time scale), we used time-resolved anisotropy measurements to
   examine potential binding of RhG as a function of the crowding agents
   (surface structure and size). For translational diffusion (mu s-s time
   scale), we used fluorescence correlation spectroscopy for
   single-molecule fluctuation analysis. Our results allow us to examine
   the diffusion model of a molecular probe in crowded environments as a
   function of concentration, length scale, homogeneous versus
   heterogeneous viscosity, size and surface structures. These biomimetic
   crowding studies, using non-invasive fluorescence spectroscopy methods,
   represent an important step towards understanding cellular biophysics
   and quantitative cell biology.}},

Abstract = {{We present a case study of a pilot project that was developed to
   evaluate the use of data mining in audit selection for the Minnesota
   Department of Revenue (DOR). The Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
   estimated the gap between revenue owed and revenue collected for 2001 to
   be approximately \$345 billion, of which they were able to recover only
   \$55 billion, and the estimated gap for 2006 was approximately \$450
   billion, of which the IRS was able to recover only \$65 billion. It is
   critical for the government to reduce the gap and the fundamental
   process for doing so is audit selection. We present a data mining based
   approach that was used to improve the audit selection process at the
   DOR. We describe the manual audit selection process used at the time of
   the pilot project for Sales and Use taxes, discuss the data from various
   sources, address issues regarding feature selection, and explain the
   data mining techniques used. Results from the pilot project revealed
   that the data mining based approach can increase efficiency in the audit
   selection process. We also report results from actual field audits
   performed by auditors at the DOR, and results validated the usefulness
   of the data mining based approach for audit selection. The impact of the
   pilot project would be a refinement of the manual audit selection
   process and tax assessment procedures for other types of taxes.}},

Abstract = {{The quality of a perovskite film determines the performance of a
   perovskite solar cell. A novel hybrid physical-chemical vapor deposition
   (HPCVD) method is presented to grow high-quality CH3NH3PbI3 films. These
   films were synthesized in a vacuum quartz tube with a constant growth
   temperature of 100 degrees C, resulting in the uniform film with grain
   sizes up to 800 nm and surface roughness of about RMS 17.4 nm. Combined
   with an optimized spin-coating process for PbI2 precursor films, a
   high-performance CH3NH3PbI3 solar cell's power conversion efficiency
   (PCE) can reach up to 14.2\%. When treated in a controlled harsh
   environment at 80 degrees C for 96 hours, ten solar cells maintained
   78\% of their initial efficiency on average, which demonstrates the
   effectiveness of this HPCVD method.}},

Pages = {{107-116}},
Abstract = {{Long-term, regional travel demand models are essential tools used by
   planning organizations for resource management, project scheduling, and
   impact studies. Developed primarily at the macroscopic level, these
   tools lack sufficient detail to capture the influence of local geometry,
   dynamic traffic controls, or advanced transportation demand management
   strategies. To bridge the gap, a hybrid mesoscopic microscopic model was
   developed. The core of the model, surrounding two light rail corridors
   in Minneapolis Saint Paul, Minnesota (the Twin Cities), was developed at
   high resolution for microscopic simulation to capture the interaction
   between traffic signals, transit systems, and the road network. The
   remainder of the greater Twin Cities area was implemented according to
   the regional planning model (RPM) maintained by the Metropolitan
   Council. Interfacing the AIMSUN-based hybrid model with the CUBE-based
   RPM, the Twin Cities metro hybrid simulation was used to improve mode
   choice and traffic assignment iteratively to achieve a dynamic user
   equilibrium state. Significant lessons were learned about the effort
   needed to develop and to maintain such a model, with implications for
   future large-scale regional modeling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a recovery system for Small Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicles (SUAVs) operated in and around urban areas. The purpose of the
   system is to provide guidance to a SUAV allowing safe navigation to an
   area where it can be recovered in the event of a GPS outage using
   current technology and implement the solution within a one year
   timeframe. The prototype SUAV system presented in this paper made use of
   a federated filtering approach to calculate position, velocity, and
   attitude in GPS-denied environments. An Attitude Heading Reference
   System computed attitude followed by an air-data based dead reckoning
   navigator to determine the velocity and position of the SUAV. This
   system was aided by position fixes derived from the onboard cell phone
   receiver. Coarsely discretized time-of-arrival (TOA) information from
   the receiver bounded the position error of the dead reckoning navigator.
   The short-term performance of the system was evaluated through flight
   testing incorporating 2-5 minute GPS outages. Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL)
   simulations were conducted to demonstrate the system performance during
   extended (30 minute) GPS outages. The average position error magnitude
   of an un-aided dead reckoning navigator at the end of 25 Monte Carlo HIL
   simulations was 5275 m. In spite of the coarse TOA data, the cell
   phone-aided system out-performed the un-aided solution and bounded the
   average error to 166 m.}},

Abstract = {{The core sub-system in the integrated navigation system presented in
   this paper was the GPS-aided Inertial Navigation System (INS) which
   provided estimates for aircraft position, velocity and attitude. In
   parallel, a cascaded system consisting of an Attitude Heading Reference
   System (AHRS) and airspeed-based dead reckoner (DR) provided redundant
   estimates of the position, velocity and attitude. Limitations in the
   AHRS-DR system typically lead to the GPS-aided INS providing better
   performance when GPS measurements are available. Conversely, the AHRS-DR
   system typically outperforms the GPS-aided INS during unaided
   operations. In view of this, it may be beneficial to design a fault
   tolerant filter that can ``softly{''} switch between the parallel
   systems to create an optimally blended solution of both.
   The integrated navigation system developed in this work was implemented
   on a small UAV flight control system, and three flight environments were
   tested to characterize the performance. Flight data analysis illustrated
   that this system is capable providing accurate state estimation even in
   environments that would compromise a traditional UAV navigation system.}},

Title = {{Characterizing Spatial Dynamics of Bifurcation to Alternans in Isolated
   Whole Rabbit Hearts Based on Alternate Pacing}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Sudden cardiac death instigated by ventricular fibrillation (VF) is the
   largest cause of natural death in the USA. Alternans, a beatto-beat
   alternation in the action potential duration, has been implicated as
   being proarrhythmic. The onset of alternans ismediated via a
   bifurcation, which may occur through either a smooth or a
   border-collision mechanism. The objective of this study was to
   characterize the mechanism of bifurcation to alternans based on
   experiments in isolated whole rabbit hearts. High resolution optical
   mapping was performed and the electrical activity was recorded from the
   left ventricle (LV) epicardial surface of the heart. Each heart was
   paced using an ``alternate pacing protocol,{''} where the basic cycle
   length (BCL) was alternatively perturbed by +/-delta. Local onset of
   alternans in the heart, BCLstart, was measured in the absence of
   perturbations (delta = 0) and was defined as the BCL at which 10\% of LV
   exhibited alternans. The influences of perturbation size were
   investigated at two BCLs: one prior to BCLstart (BCLprior = BCLstart +
   20ms) and one preceding BCLprior (BCLfar = BCLstart + 40ms). Our results
   demonstrate significant spatial correlation of the region exhibiting
   alternans with smooth bifurcation characteristics, indicating that
   transition to alternans in isolated rabbit hearts occurs predominantly
   through smooth bifurcation.}},

Abstract = {{Circuity, the ratio of network to Euclidean distances, describes the
   directness of trips and the efficiency of transportation networks. This
   paper measures the circuity of the fifty-one most populated Metropolitan
   Statistical Areas (MSAs) in the United States and identifies trends in
   those circuities between 1990 and 2010. Overall circuity has increased
   between 1990 and 2010: random points have not only become farther apart
   in distance, their shortest network path has become more circuitous,
   suggesting that the more recently constructed parts of street networks
   are laid out more circuitously than older parts of the network. Over
   this period thirty-five MSAs experienced a statistically significant
   increase in circuity (six experienced a significant decrease). As
   expected, short trips are more circuitous than long trips. A new
   circuity distance-decay function describes how circuity varies with
   distance within metropolitan areas. The parameters of this function have
   changed from 1990 to 2010.}},

Journal = {{GREEN CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{5069-5078}},
Abstract = {{The properties of lignin-based polymeric materials depend on blend
   composition and casting conditions. When solution-cast at 150 degrees
   and annealed at 180 degrees C, blends containing 85\% w/w levels of
   methylated ball-milled softwood lignin can surpass polystyrene in
   tensile behaviour. It is more challenging to achieve similar results
   with comparable blends of ligninsulphonates, whether methylated or not.
   Nevertheless, 85\% w/w ligninsulphonate-based materials containing
   miscible low-Tg polymers can match the tensile properties of
   polyethylene. The ligninsulphonate components themselves are assembled
   into 9-15 nm macromolecular entities, the integrities of which are
   maintained through strong noncovalent interactions between inner
   co-facially disposed aromatic rings. In contrast, the peripheral
   aromatic rings typically exhibit a greater incidence of less stable
   edge-on arrangements. An intriguing aspect of the materials that are
   composed solely of (unmethylated or methylated) ligninsulphonates is
   their insolubility in water. This observation is consistent with the
   absence of a discernible glass-transition temperature in the
   differential scanning calorimetric thermograms of ligninsulphonate-based
   materials when they prominently display domains maintained by strong
   interactions between co-facial aromatic rings. The demonstrated
   integrity of polymeric materials composed (almost) exclusively of simple
   lignin derivatives has far-reaching implications for the configurations
   of lignin macromolecules in general. Contrary to an enduring hypothesis
   proposed 55 years ago, polymer chains in lignin preparations are not
   covalently crosslinked, even though their conformations are clearly
   affected by powerful noncovalent forces between the aromatic
   substructures.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse matrices are common in scientific computing and machine learning.
   By storing and processing only the non-zero elements of a matrix
   containing mostly zeros, sparse matrix algorithms often reduce
   computation and storage requirements of operations by an order of
   complexity. The order of the rows and columns of the matrix can have a
   significant impact on the efficiency of sparse direct methods. For
   example, in a Cholesky decomposition, it is desirable to re-order the
   input matrix so as to reduce the number of non-zeros in the factors. One
   of the most effective methods for re-ordering is nested dissection,
   where vertex separators are recursively found in the graph
   representation of the matrix and are used to permute the rows and
   columns. In this work we investigate the creation of vertex separators
   on shared memory parallel architectures and their use in nested
   dissection. We introduce a new effective scheme for refining a vertex
   separator in parallel, and a specialized parallel task scheduling scheme
   for the nested dissection problem. These algorithms have been
   implemented in the mt-Metis framework. Our experiments show that
   mt-Metis is 1.5x faster than ParMetis while producing orderings with
   3.7\% fewer non-zeros and 14.0\% fewer operations.}},

Abstract = {{The Best-start-time Lagrangian Shortest Path (BLSP) problem requires
   choosing the start time that yields the shortest path in a
   time-dependent graph. The inputs to the problem are a spatio-temporal
   network, an origin, o, a destination, d, and a discrete interval of
   possible start times. The solution is a path, P, and a start time, t,
   such that the total time taken to travel along P, starting at t, is no
   greater than the time taken to travel along any path from o to d, if we
   start in the given interval. The problem is important when the traveler
   is flexible about the start time, but would like to select a start time
   that minimizes the travel time. Its computational challenges arise from
   the large number of start time instants, and the manner in which the
   length of the shortest lagrangian path can vary from one start time
   instant to the next. Earlier work focused largely on finding the
   shortest path for a single start time. Researchers recently considered
   the BLSP problem, and proposed an approach based on finding the shortest
   lagrangian path for each start time, and then picking the best. Such an
   approach performs redundant evaluation of common sub-expressions,
   because time is explored in a sequential manner. We present an
   algorithm, BESTIMES, and propose an implementation that uses a
   Temporally Expanded priority queue. Our algorithm is built on the idea
   of ``spatio-temporal opportunism{''}, which allows us to navigate both
   space and time simultaneously in a non-sequential manner and
   appropriately combine sub-paths. Theoretical analysis and experiments on
   real data show that there is a welldefined range of inputs over which
   this approach performs significantly better than previous approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Given a set of trajectories annotated with measurements of physical
   variables, the problem of Non-compliant Window Co-occurrence (NWC)
   pattern discovery aims to determine temporal signatures in the
   explanatory variables which are highly associated with windows of
   undesirable behavior in a target variable. NWC discovery is important
   for societal applications such as eco-friendly transportation (e.g.
   identifying engine signatures leading to high greenhouse gas emissions).
   Challenges of designing a scalable algorithm for NWC discovery include
   the non-monotonicity of popular spatio-temporal statistical interest
   measures of association such as the cross-K function. This challenge
   renders the anti-monotone pruning based algorithms (e.g. Apriori)
   inapplicable. To address this limitation, we propose two novel upper
   bounds for the cross-K function which help in filtering uninteresting
   candidate patterns. Using these bounds, we also propose a Multi-Parent
   Tracking approach (MTN-Miner) for mining NWC patterns. A case study with
   real world engine data demonstrates the ability of the proposed approach
   to discover patterns which are interesting to engine scientists.
   Experimental evaluation on real-world data show that MTN Miner results
   in substantial computational savings over the naive approach.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1478-1497}},
Abstract = {{The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been widely
   used for solving structured convex optimization problems. In particular,
   the ADMM can solve convex programs that minimize the sum of N convex
   functions whose variables are linked by some linear constraints. While
   the convergence of the ADMM for N = 2 was well established in the
   literature, it remained an open problem for a long time whether the ADMM
   for N >= 3 is still convergent. Recently, it was shown in {[}Chen et
   al., Math. Program. (2014), DOI 10.1007/s10107-014-0826-5.] that without
   additional conditions the ADMM for N >= 3 generally fails to converge.
   In this paper, we show that under some easily verifiable and reasonable
   conditions the global linear convergence of the ADMM when N >= 3 can
   still be ensured, which is important since the ADMM is a popular method
   for solving large-scale multiblock optimization models and is known to
   perform very well in practice even when N >= 3. Our study aims to offer
   an explanation for this phenomenon.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2481}},
Pages = {{56-64}},
Abstract = {{Over the course of their service life, concrete pavements undergo
   significant traffic and climatic loads, which lead to a gradual
   accumulation of damage. This accumulation of damage and distress comes
   from the effects of changing weather conditions (e.g., temperature,
   moisture) and continuous vehicular traffic. Repeated environmental and
   traffic loading leads to cracking and spalling of the concrete at the
   joint edges. States in the northern portion of the United States and the
   provinces of Canada have climates that fluctuate greatly in temperature
   throughout the seasons. Greater temperature differentials cause greater
   deflections in rigid pavements; these deflections lead to more prevalent
   spalling and a greater need for partial depth repair. Many U.S. state
   departments of transportation (DOTs) use partial depth repair as routine
   practice to maintain concrete pavements (e.g., the DOTs of Minnesota,
   North Dakota, South Dakota, Idaho, Montana, Washington, and Wisconsin).
   Enhanced acceptance criteria of rapid set cementitious materials for use
   in partial depth repair are needed. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate laboratory tests, recommended by ASTM C928 and others, for
   inclusion in the acceptance specifications for patching materials.}},

Abstract = {{The use of therapeutic ablation in patients with atrial fibrillation has
   become a mainstay in the treatment of this disease, yet often these
   individuals require multiple procedures. In other words, successful
   first time treatments are impacted by challenges, including the
   generation of linear lesions in certain anatomies like the mitral
   isthmus of the left atrium. Hence, there is a need to find ways to
   address the presence of unwanted conduction gaps at the time of lesion
   creation. In this paper, we describe a novel approach to examine
   conduction gaps, by using a proof of concept device to examine local
   electrical activation within the cardiac areas of an applied lesion,
   i.e., to locate gaps in the lesion set. To accomplish this, both
   epicardial and endocardial linear ablation lines composed of spot
   lesions with conduction gaps were created in a porcine model. The forces
   necessary to elicit monophasic action potentials (MAP) were collected
   from >200 measurements on the epicardium of the right ventricle.
   Ablations were then performed on the ventricular epicardium and left
   atrial mitral isthmus endocardially, while recording MAPs. We were able
   to successfully demonstrate the use of a proof of concept device to
   identify conduction gaps in linear lesion sets; furthermore, we were
   able to determine required contact forces to appropriately determine
   focal electrical changes of the underlying tissues. New catheter designs
   that incorporate capabilities to record focal MAPs could be employed
   clinically to better assess a given lesion quality and/or to determine
   the existence of an undesired conduction gap.}},

Title = {{Modeling vapor uptake induced mobility shifts in peptide ions observed

Abstract = {{Low field ion mobility spectrometry-mass spectrometry (IMS-MS)
   techniques exhibit low orthogonality, as inverse mobility often scales
   with mass to charge ratio. This inadequacy can be mitigated by adding
   vapor dopants, which may cluster with analyte ions and shift their
   mobilities by amounts independent of both mass and mobility of the ion.
   It is therefore important to understand the interactions of vapor
   dopants with ions, to better quantify the extent of dopant facilitated
   mobility shifts. Here, we develop predictive models of vapor dopant
   facilitated mobility shifts, and compare model calculations to
   measurements of mobility shifts for peptide ions exposed to variable gas
   phase concentrations of isopropanol. Mobility measurements were made at
   atmospheric pressure and room temperature using a recently developed
   transversal modulation ion mobility spectrometer (TMIMS). Results are
   compared to three separate models, wherein mobility shifts due to vapor
   dopants are attributed to changes in gas composition and (I) no vapor
   dopant uptake is assumed, (II) site-specific dopant uptake by the ion is
   assumed (approximated via a Langmuir adsorption model), and (III)
   site-unspecific dopant uptake by the ion is assumed (approximated via a
   classical nucleation model). We find that mobility shifts in peptide
   ions are in excellent agreement with model II, site-specific binding
   predictions. Conversely, mobility shifts of tetraalkylammonium ions from
   previous measurements were compared with these models and best agreement
   was found with model III predictions, i.e. site-unspecific dopant
   uptake.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual integration techniques focus on building architectural models of
   systems that can be analyzed early in the design cycle to try to lower
   cost, reduce risk, and improve quality of complex embedded systems.
   Given appropriate architectural descriptions and compositional reasoning
   rules, these techniques can be used to prove important safety properties
   about the architecture prior to system construction. Such proofs build
   from ``leaf-level{''} assume/guarantee component contracts through
   architectural layers towards top-level safety properties. The proofs are
   built upon the premise that each leaf-level component contract is
   realizable; i.e., it is possible to construct a component such that for
   any input allowed by the contract assumptions, there is some output
   value that the component can produce that satisfies the contract
   guarantees. Without engineering support it is all too easy to write
   leaf-level components that can't be realized. Realizability checking for
   propositional contracts has been well-studied for many years, both for
   component synthesis and checking correctness of temporal logic
   requirements. However, checking realizability for contracts involving
   infinite theories is still an open problem. In this paper, we describe a
   new approach for checking realizability of contracts involving theories
   and demonstrate its usefulness on several examples.}},

Abstract = {{Structural coverage metrics have traditionally categorized code as
   either covered or uncovered. Recent work presents a stronger notion of
   coverage, checked coverage, which counts only statements whose execution
   contributes to an outcome checked by an oracle. While this notion of
   coverage addresses the adequacy of the oracle, for Model-Based
   Development of safety critical systems, it is still not enough; we are
   also interested in how much of the oracle is covered, and whether the
   values of program variables are masked when the oracle is evaluated.
   Such information can help system engineers identify missing requirements
   as well as missing test cases. In this work, we combine results from
   checked coverage with results from requirements coverage to help provide
   insight to engineers as to whether the requirements or the test suite
   need to be improved. We implement a dynamic backward slicing technique
   and evaluate it on several systems developed in Simulink. The results of
   our preliminary study show that even for systems with comprehensive test
   suites and good sets of requirements, our approach can identify cases
   where more tests or more requirements are needed to improve coverage
   numbers.}},

Title = {{Analysis on Strong Tracking Filtering for Linear Dynamic Systems}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Strong tracking filtering (STF) is a popular adaptive estimation method
   to effectively deal with state estimation for linear and nonlinear
   dynamic systems with inaccurate models or sudden change of state. The
   key of the STF is to use a time-variant fading factor, which can be
   evaluated based on the current measurement innovation in real time, to
   forcefully correct one step state prediction error covariance. The
   strong tracking filtering technology has been extensively applied in
   many practical systems, but the theoretical analysis is highly lacking.
   In an effort to better understand STF, a novel analysis framework is
   developed for the strong tracking filtering and some new problems are
   discussed for the first time. For this, we propose a new perspective
   that correcting the state prediction error covariance by using the
   fading factor can be thought of directly modifying the state model by
   correcting the covariance of the process noise. Based on this proposed
   point of view, the conditions for the STF function to be effective are
   deeply analyzed in a certain linear dynamic system. Meanwhile, issues of
   false alarm and alarm failure are also briefly discussed for the strong
   tracking filtering function. Some numerical simulation examples are
   demonstrated to validate the results.}},

   Applications}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2015}},
Number = {{2536}},
Pages = {{37-43}},
Abstract = {{Federally subsidized transit funding is based on ridership; therefore,
   an accurate count of passengers is imperative. Most existing automated
   passenger counters (APCs) use infrared beam methods of detection. Such
   systems are expensive and inaccurate for scenarios such as
   multiple-passenger boarding and alighting. The preliminary results are
   reported here from a novel APC method that has the potential to improve
   accuracy over existing technology while decreasing overall system cost.
   This result is accomplished through integration of existing vehicle
   systems that include the vehicle air ride suspension, which has
   near-universal adoption in transit buses. The system counts passengers
   by measuring pressure inside the vehicle air bag suspension system,
   which directly correlates to vehicle mass. Two algorithms were developed
   to detect discrete boarding events on the basis of time-resolved vehicle
   mass data. The first algorithm uses incremental change of vehicle mass,
   assuming a well-calibrated average passenger mass of 168 Ib (76 kg),
   resulting in a -2.4\% error. The second algorithm uses the vehicle mass
   time derivative to improve the resolution of boarding and alighting
   events but with overall error increased to -28.4\%. Experimental testing
   of the mass-based APC system on an in-service transit bus showed that
   the mass correlation method outperformed the existing infrared beam APC,
   which had a 17.5\% error; however, bus kneeling events proved
   problematic for both the mass correlation and the event-based mass
   methods. Initial results are encouraging and prompt the necessity for
   further study and refinement. However, more work must be done to address
   the kneeling issue.}},

Journal = {{COMMUNICATIONS IN STATISTICS-THEORY AND METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3375-3386}},
Abstract = {{Using majorization theory, upper and lower bounds are derived for
   different measures of variation as progressively more items of
   information are available about the sample data. As a convenient
   starting point, bounds are first established for a one-parameter family
   of variation measures, which is a generalized mean difference measure of
   which Gini's mean difference, the standard deviation, and the range are
   particular cases. While, as pointed out, some of the derived bounds are
   well known, others do not appear to have been published and are tighter
   than established bounds. Some 40 different bounds are derived, besides
   any number of bounds given for the generalized family of variation
   measures. A number of interesting inequalities are also derived on the
   basis of some of the bounds. While the bounds have been developed in
   terms of real-valued sample data generally, the paper concludes with a
   brief discussion of the bounds for categorical data when the sample data
   consists of frequencies (counts).}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{67}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We celebrate the first quantitative evidence for the stress
   concentration effect of flaws analyzed by Inglis. Stress concentration
   factor (SCF) studies have evolved ever since Inglis' 1913 result related
   to the problem of the elliptical hole in a plate, which also
   approximately applies to the half-elliptical notch case. We summarize a
   hundred years of development of the SCF with the exclusive focus on
   analytical solutions, with a very specific route: the series of works
   reviewed and presented herein include a parade of solutions beginning
   with (and those that followed) Inglis famous result, continue with
   periodic discrete discontinuities, sinusoidal periodic surfaces, and end
   with more complex continuous configurations such as random surfaces.
   Furthermore, we show that the form of Inglis' result is powerful enough
   to serve as first-order approximation for some cases of multiple
   discontinuities and even continuous rough topologies. Thus, we proposed
   the Modified Inglis formula (MIF), to estimate the SCF for a variety of
   configurations, in honor to Inglis' historical result. The impetus of
   this review stems from the fact that for many engineering problems
   involving multiphysical solid-fluid interactions, there is a broad
   interest to couple stress concentration relationships with
   thermodynamics, fluid dynamics, or even diffusion equations in order to
   expand understanding on stress-driven interactions at the solid-fluid
   interface. Additionally, a handy first-order estimate of the SCF can
   serve in the initial stage of designs of structures and parts containing
   discontinuities.}},

Title = {{Reducing coke formation in the catalytic fast pyrolysis of bio-derived

Abstract = {{In order to reduce coke yield during catalytic fast pyrolysis of
   biomass, MgO and 2,4-dimethylquinoline (2,4-DMQ) were selected to reduce
   the number of external acid sites of HZSM-5. Both MgO and 2,4-DMQ
   deposition could cause a reduction in total acid sites (both weak acid
   sites and strong acid sites) and external acid sites of HZSM-5. The
   modified catalysts were used for the catalytic conversion of bio-derived
   furan. For the MgO/HZSM-5 catalyst, the effects of amount of MgO
   deposited and deposition time were studied. The carbon yields of
   aromatics, C-2-C-5 olefins, total chemicals, CO2 and CO increased at
   first and then decreased slightly when the deposited amount increased,
   while the carbon yield of coke decreased first and then increased
   gradually. Furthermore, as the deposited time increased, the carbon
   yields of petrochemicals, CO2 and CO increased greatly, whereas that of
   coke decreased. For the 2,4-DMQ/HZSM-5 catalyst, the effects of 2,4-DMQ
   treatment amount and treatment time were investigated. The experimental
   results showed that an increase in 2,4-DMQ treatment amount or treatment
   time could retard the generation of the target products, CO2 and CO but
   promote coke formation.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{29}},
Pages = {{5947-5954}},
Abstract = {{We propose an interpolation formula (the EV-WLC relation) for the
   force-extension behavior of wormlike chains in the presence of hard-core
   excluded volume interactions, analogous to the classic interpolation
   formula from Marko and Siggia for ideal wormlike chains. Using
   pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) simulations of asymptotically
   long, discrete wormlike chains in an external force, we show that the
   error in the EV-WLC interpolation formula to describe discrete wormlike
   chains is systematically smaller than the error in the Marko-Siggia
   interpolation formula, except for the saturation region in which both
   formulas have the same limiting behavior. We anticipate that the EV-WLC
   interpolation formula will prove useful in the coarse-graining of
   wormlike chain models for dynamic simulations. Related results for the
   excess free energy due to excluded volume provide strong support for the
   physical basis of the Pincus regime.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method for calculating a two-dimensional refractive index
   field from measured boundary values of beam position and slope. By
   initially ignoring the dependence of beam trajectories on the index
   field and using cubic polynomials to approximate these trajectories, we
   show that the inverse problem can be reduced to set of linear algebraic
   equations and solved using a numerical algorithm suited for inverting
   sparse, ill-conditioned linear systems. The beam trajectories are
   subsequently corrected using an iterative ray trace procedure so that
   they are consistent with the ray equation inside the calculated index
   field. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method through computer
   simulation, where a hypothetical test index field is reconstructed on a
   15x15 discrete grid using 800 interrogating rays and refractive index
   errors (RMS) less than 0.5\% of the total index range (n(max) - n(min))
   are achieved. In the subsequent error analysis, we identify three
   primary sources of error contributing to the reconstruction of the index
   field and assess the importance of data redundancy. The principles
   developed in our approach are fully extendable to three-dimensional
   index fields as well as more complex geometries.}},

Title = {{Fine tuning of nanopipettes using atomic layer deposition for single
   molecule sensing}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{4828-4834}},
Abstract = {{Nanopipettes are an attractive single-molecule tool for identification
   and characterisation of nucleic acids and proteins in solutions. They
   enable label-free analysis and reveal individual molecular properties,
   which are generally masked by ensemble averaging. Having control over
   the pore dimensions is vital to ensure that the dimensions of the
   molecules being probed match those of the pore for optimization of the
   signal to noise. Although nanopipettes are simple and easy to fabricate,
   challenges exist, especially when compared to more conventional
   solid-state analogues. For example, a sub-20 nm pore diameter can be
   difficult to fabricate and the batch-to-batch reproducibility is often
   poor. To improve on this limitation, atomic layer deposition (ALD) is
   used to deposit ultrathin layers of alumina (Al2O3) on the surface of
   the quartz nanopipettes enabling sub-nm tuning of the pore dimensions.
   Here, Al2O3 with a thickness of 8, 14 and 17 nm was deposited onto
   pipettes with a starting pore diameter of 75 +/- 5 nm whilst a second
   batch had 5 and 8 nm Al2O3 deposited with a starting pore diameter of 25
   +/- 3 nm respectively. This highly conformal process coats both the
   inner and outer surfaces of pipettes and resulted in the fabrication of
   pore diameters as low as 7.5 nm. We show that Al2O3 modified pores do
   not interfere with the sensing ability of the nanopipettes and can be
   used for high signal-to-noise DNA detection. ALD provides a quick and
   efficient (batch processing) for fine-tuning nanopipettes for a broad
   range of applications including the detection of small biomolecules like
   RNA, aptamers and DNA-protein interactions at the single molecule level.}},

   nanochannels}},
Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{140}},

Pages = {{4887-4894}},
Abstract = {{We present experimental data concerning potential topological events
   such as folds, internal backfolds, and/or knots within long molecules of
   double-stranded DNA when they are stretched by confinement in a
   nanochannel. Genomic DNA from E. coli was labeled near the `GCTCTTC'
   sequence with a fluorescently labeled dUTP analog and stained with the
   DNA intercalator YOYO. Individual long molecules of DNA were then
   linearized and imaged using methods based on the NanoChannel Array
   technology (Irys (R) System) available from BioNano Genomics. Data were
   collected on 189 153 molecules of length greater than 50 kilobases. A
   custom code was developed to search for abnormal intensity spikes in the
   YOYO backbone profile along the length of individual molecules. By
   correlating the YOYO intensity spikes with the aligned barcode pattern
   to the reference, we were able to correlate the bright intensity regions
   of YOYO with abnormal stretching in the molecule, which suggests these
   events were either a knot or a region of internal backfolding within the
   DNA. We interpret the results of our experiments involving molecules
   exceeding 50 kilobases in the context of existing simulation data for
   relatively short DNA, typically several kilobases. The frequency of
   these events is lower than the predictions from simulations, while the
   size of the events is larger than simulation predictions and often
   exceeds the molecular weight of the simulated molecules. We also
   identified DNA molecules that exhibit large, single folds as they enter
   the nanochannels. Overall, topological events occur at a low frequency
   (similar to 7\% of all molecules) and pose an easily surmountable
   obstacle for the practice of genome mapping in nanochannels.}},

Abstract = {{The potential hazards of humic acid (HA) associated with hog waste
   effluent, coupled with increasing awareness of environmental problems,
   have prompted many countries to control disposal of effluents into water
   bodies and to maximize removal of HA. Here we employed the white-rot
   fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, to degrade the HA in composted hog
   waste effluent, evaluated by the response surface method. Preliminary
   experiments demonstrate that pH, temperature and quantity of inoculum
   are significant variables determining success of the fungus. In total,
   13 experiments were conducted with three variables designated as A (pH),
   B (temperature) and C (inoculum amount). The optimal conditions for
   reduction of HA by P. chrysosporium are pH 6, 31.5 degrees C and an
   inoculum quantity of 5.86 g. Predicted and experimental results exhibit
   strong agreement, indicating efficiency in the model obtained by
   response surface method. Therefore, P. chrysosporium is an effective
   micro-organism for removal of HA from composted hog waste effluent.}},

Abstract = {{Narrow size distribution of quantum dots (QDs) is needed for their
   application in photovoltaics but collection of such information is
   difficult. Many experiments have shown the photoluminescence (PL)
   spectrum of Si QDs will broaden and peak position is size dependent.
   However, there is still lack of quantitative analysis of such
   phenomenon. In this paper, a model is developed to fit the PL spectrum
   based on spontaneous emission and the size distribution of the QDs. With
   this model, we can quantitatively analyse the QD size and its
   distribution using the PL spectra only, saving the need of time
   consuming and destructive characterization methods such as transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM). The optical bandgap can be extracted
   naturally from this PL model. The size and distribution of the QD which
   are obtained by fitting the PL spectra are then confirmed by
   measurements using TEM and XRD.}},

Title = {{Dynamics and rheology of nonpolar bijels}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{26}},
Pages = {{5282-5293}},
Abstract = {{Bicontinuous, interfacially jammed, emulsion gels (bijels) are a novel
   class of materials composed of two immiscible phases with
   interpenetrating domains that are stabilized by a monolayer of colloidal
   particles at the interface. However, existing bijel systems so far all
   consist of at least one polar fluid, which is believed to be essential
   to induce electrostatic repulsion for stabilizing interfacial particles.
   It is not known whether two nonpolar fluids can form a bijel. Here, we
   experimentally achieve a bijel using styrene trimer and low molecular
   weight polybutene-two nonpolar fluids that are similar to polymer
   blends, which are important in technical applications. By combining
   laser scanning confocal microscopy, cryo-SEM and rheology measurement,
   we systematically investigate the dynamics and rheology of this nonpolar
   bijel. In contrast to previous studies on polar bijels, we observe the
   formation of localized regions of high particle concentration or
   ``particle patches{''} on the interface which assemble during
   coarsening. We also provide the first quantitative relation between the
   morphology of a bijel, the interfacial particle coverage and the shear
   modulus during bijel coarsening. Moreover, we reveal a previously
   unnoticed increase in the elastic modulus of bijels that can be
   attributed to the rearrangement of interfacial particles at long time
   scales. In addition, we also found a hydrophobic particle framework that
   survives after the direct remixing of the nonpolar bijel. Our study
   provides important insights into the formation of bijels and is the
   first step to explore the missing link between polar bijels and
   particle-stabilized bicontinuous polymer blends.}},

Title = {{Biophysics of alpha-synuclein induced membrane remodelling}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{15561-15568}},
Abstract = {{alpha-Synuclein is an intrinsically disordered protein whose aggregation
   is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease. In neurons, alpha-synuclein is
   thought to play important roles in mediating both endo-and exocytosis of
   synaptic vesicles through interactions with either the lipid bilayer or
   other proteins. Upon membrane binding, the N-terminus of alpha-synuclein
   forms a helical structure and inserts into the hydrophobic region of the
   outer membrane leaflet. However, membrane structural changes induced by
   alpha-synuclein are still largely unclear. Here we report a substantial
   membrane area expansion induced by the binding of alpha-synuclein
   monomers. This measurement is accomplished by observing the increase of
   membrane area during the binding of alpha-synuclein to pipette-aspirated
   giant vesicles. The extent of membrane area expansion correlates
   linearly with the density of alpha-synuclein on the membrane, revealing
   a constant area increase induced by the binding per alpha-synuclein
   molecule. The area expansion per synuclein is found to exhibit a strong
   dependence on lipid composition, but is independent of membrane tension
   and vesicle size. Fragmentation or tubulation of the membrane follows
   the membrane expansion process. However, contrary to BAR domain
   proteins, no distinct tubulation-transition density can apparently be
   identified for alpha-synuclein, suggesting a more complex membrane
   curvature generation mechanism. Consideration of alpha-synuclein's
   membrane binding free energy and biophysical properties of the lipid
   bilayer leads us to conclude that membrane expansion by alpha-synuclein
   results in thinning of the bilayer. These membrane thinning and
   tubulation effects may underlie alpha-synuclein's role in mediating cell
   trafficking processes such as endo-and exocytosis.}},

Title = {{Simultaneous ion and neutral evaporation in aqueous nanodrops:
   experiment, theory, and molecular dynamics simulations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{15746-15755}},
Abstract = {{We use a combination of tandem ion mobility spectrometry (IMS-IMS, with
   differential mobility analyzers), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
   and analytical models to examine both neutral solvent (H2O) and ion
   (solvated Na+) evaporation from aqueous sodium chloride nanodrops. For
   experiments, nanodrops were produced via electrospray ionization (ESI)
   of an aqueous sodium chloride solution. Two nanodrops were examined in
   MD simulations: a 2500 water molecule nanodrop with 68 Na+ and 60 Cl-
   ions (an initial net charge of z = +8), and (2) a 1000 water molecule
   nanodrop with 65 Na+ and 60 Cl- ions (an initial net charge of z = +5).
   Specifically, we used MD simulations to examine the validity of a model
   for the neutral evaporation rate incorporating both the Kelvin (surface
   curvature) and Thomson (electrostatic) influences, while both MD
   simulations and experimental measurements were compared to predictions
   of the ion evaporation rate equation of Labowsky et al. {[}Anal. Chim.
   Acta, 2000, 406, 105-118]. Within a single fit parameter, we find
   excellent agreement between simulated and modeled neutral evaporation
   rates for nanodrops with solute volume fractions below 0.30. Similarly,
   MD simulation inferred ion evaporation rates are in excellent agreement
   with predictions based on the Labowsky et al. equation. Measurements of
   the sizes and charge states of ESI generated NaCl clusters suggest that
   the charge states of these clusters are governed by ion evaporation,
   however, ion evaporation appears to have occurred with lower activation
   energies in experiments than was anticipated based on analytical
   calculations as well as MD simulations. Several possible reasons for
   this discrepancy are discussed.}},

Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulations provide an efficient method for
   exploring the structure and phase behavior of block polymer melts.
   However, the results of such simulations may differ from the equilibrium
   behavior of a hypothetical infinite system as a consequence of the
   finite size of the simulation box. Standard finite-size scaling
   techniques cannot be employed to remove the effects of a small system
   size due to incommensurability between the ordered structure domain
   spacing and the periodicity of the simulation box. This work describes a
   systematic approach to estimating the equilibrium domain spacing in
   lattice MC simulations of symmetric diblock copolymers, and thereby
   minimize the effects of incommensurability. Results for simulations with
   commensurate simulation boxes, which are designed to be commensurate
   with the preferred lattice periodicity but contain different numbers of
   unit cells, show that once the effects of incommensurability are
   removed, the effects of finite size alone are relatively small.}},

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},

Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{10465-10471}},
Abstract = {{Laws of corresponding states known so far demonstrate that certain
   macroscopic systems can be described in a universal manner in terms of
   reduced quantities, which eliminate specific substance properties. To
   quantitatively describe real systems, all these laws of corresponding
   states contain numerical factors adjusted empirically. Here, we report a
   law of corresponding states deduced analytically for charge transport
   via tunneling in molecular junctions, which we validate against
   current-voltage measurements for conducting probe atomic force
   microscope junctions based on benchmark molecular series
   (oligophenylenedithiols and alkanedithiols) and electrodes (silver,
   gold, and platinum), as well as against transport data for scanning
   tunneling microscope junctions. Two salient features distinguish the
   present law of corresponding states from all those known previously.
   First, it is expressed by a universal curve free of empirical
   parameters. Second, it demonstrates that a universal behavior is not
   necessarily affected by strong stochastic fluctuations often observed in
   molecular electronics. An important and encouraging message of this
   finding is that transport behavior across different molecular platforms
   can be similar and extraordinarily reproducible.}},

Abstract = {{A paper-based colorimetric biosensor suitable for point-of-care bioassay
   of blood samples is developed using highly stable enzyme thin-film
   coatings confined within inkjet printed polymeric microwells. The
   microwells are developed through a simple one-step inkjet printing of
   hydrophobic polystyrene on paper, with walls formed by the polymer that
   fills the gaps inside the paper body. The microwells can also be
   patterned to be interlinked with printed microchannels for multiplex
   bioassays. Thin film enzyme coatings confined within the microwells are
   then constructed, thereby constituting biosensors that work like
   traditional microwell plates, yet allow easy colorimetric readouts with
   naked eyes or portable devices, such as smart phones. The efficiency of
   the paper-based sensor was demonstrated for colorimetric assays of
   glucose and lactate, both as individual analytes or mixed, as well as
   samples with red blood cells. Such sensors showed good sensitivities
   within the concentration ranges of the analytes in human blood (0.5-10
   mM), with a visible sensitivity of < 0.5 mM detectable by naked eyes for
   a sample size as small as 1 mu L. More accurate digital readouts were
   shown to be feasible with computerized scanners or smart-phones. The
   thin-film coating format affords the paper biosensors an extended
   lifetime, and they could retain 100\% performance over 6 months of
   storage at room temperature, or up to one month heated at 50 degrees C,
   which promises refrigeration-free storage of the sensor. The simple
   preparation, high enzyme stability and ease-of-use of the paper-based
   sensor promise low-cost and reliable point-of-care multiplex bioassay
   for biomedical diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) were dispersed in a cement-sand-based
   piezoelectric smart composite as conductive fillers to improve its
   poling efficiency, leading to a desirable piezoelectric effect. By
   introducing a small amount of CNTs, continuous electric networks between
   Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT) particles were created, thus making the
   composite poling easier. Specimens were prepared by mixing PZT powders,
   Portland cement and sand with CNTs, followed by pressing it with a load
   frame system. The effect of quantity of CNTs ranging from 0 to 1.0
   volume percent on properties of the composite, including its
   piezoelectric coefficient, dielectric constant and loss, and sensing
   effects, were characterized. It was found that the addition of CNTs
   facilitated effective poling at room temperature and improved the
   piezoelectric and dielectric properties of the composite. The composite
   modified by CNTs achieved optimal properties when the CNTs content was
   0.7 vol.\%.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Various types of mesoporous silica, such as continuous
   cubic-phaseMCM-48, hexagonal-phaseMCM-41, and layer-phase spherical
   silica particles, have been synthesized at room temperature using
   cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant, ethanol as a
   cosurfactant, tetraethyl orthosilicate as a silica precursor, and
   ammonia as a condensation agent. Special care must be taken both in the
   filtering of the resultant solid products and in the drying process. In
   the drying process, further condensation of the silica after filtering
   was induced. As the surfactant and cosurfactant concentrations in the
   reaction mixture increased and the NH3 concentration decreased, under
   given conditions, continuous cubic MCM-48 and layered silica became the
   dominant phases. A cooperative synthesis mechanism, in which both the
   surfactant and silica were involved in the formation of mesoporous

Pages = {{15019-15029}},
Abstract = {{pending issue in linking ion mobility measurements to ion structures is
   that the collisional cross section (CCS, the measured structural
   parameter in ion mobility spectrometry) of an ion is strongly dependent
   upon the manner in which gas molecules effectively impinge on and are
   reemitted from ion surfaces (when modeling ions as fixed structures). To
   directly examine the gas molecule impingement and reemission processes
   and their influence, we measured the CCSs of positively charged ions of
   room temperature ionic liquids 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanamide
   (EMIM-N(CN)(2)) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate
   (EMIM-BF4) in N-2 using a differential mobility analyzer-mass
   spectrometer (DMA-MS) and in He using a drift tube mobility
   spectrometer-mass spectrometer (DT-MS). Cluster ions, generated via
   electrosprays, took the form (AB)(N)(A)(z), spanning up to z = 20 and
   with masses greater than 100 kDa. As confirmed by molecular dynamics
   simulations, at the measurement temperature (similar to 300 K), such
   cluster ions took on globular conformations in the gas phase. Based upon
   their attained charge levels, in neither He nor N-2 did the ion-induced
   dipole potential significantly influence gas molecule-ion collisions.
   Therefore, differences in the CCSs measured for ions in the two
   different gases could be primarily attributed to differences in gas
   molecule behavior upon collision with ions. Overwhelmingly, by
   comparison of predicted CCSs with selected input impingement-reemission
   laws to measurements, we find that in N-2, gas molecules collide with
   ions diffusely - they are reemitted at random angles relative to the gas
   molecule incoming angle - and inelastically. Meanwhile, in He, gas
   molecules collide specularly and elastically and are emitted from ion
   surfaces at determined angles. The results can be rationalized on the
   basis of the momentum transferred per collision; in the case of He,
   individual gas molecule collisions minimally perturb the atoms within a
   cluster ion (internal motion), while in the case of N-2, individual gas
   molecules have sufficiently large momentum to alter the internal motion
   in organic ions.}},

Abstract = {{Although originally popularized for structural health monitoring,
   wireless smart sensors are an attractive alternative to traditional
   tethered systems for structural control. Their onboard sensing,
   processing, and wireless communication offer all the components of a
   feedback control system. However, wireless smart sensors pose unique
   challenges for the application of centralized control, which is common
   in most modern control systems. Decentralized control offers several
   advantages to wireless structural control, including limiting the
   wireless communication required and the associated slow sampling rate
   and time delays in the control system. Previous decentralized structural
   control algorithms, both Ad-Hoc and Heuristic, enforce a spatial
   sparsity pattern during the design, which is assumed a priori.
   Therefore, the optimal feedback structure is not considered in the
   design. This work explores a decentralized optimal LQR design algorithm
   where the sparsity of the feedback gain is incorporated into the
   objective function. The control approach is compared to previous
   decentralized control techniques on the 20-Story control benchmark
   structure. Sparsity and control requirements are compared to centralized
   designs. The optimal sparse feedback design offers the best balance of
   performance, measurement feedback, and control effort. Additionally, the
   feedback structure identified is not easily identifiable a priori; thus,
   highlighting the significance of particular measurements in this
   feedback framework.}},

Title = {{Linear Models Based on Noisy Data and the Frisch Scheme}},
Journal = {{SIAM REVIEW}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{167-197}},
Abstract = {{We address the problem of identifying linear relations among variables
   based on noisy measurements. This is a central question in the search
   for structure in large data sets. Often a key assumption is that
   measurement errors in each variable are independent. This basic
   formulation has its roots in the work of Charles Spearman in 1904 and of
   Ragnar Frisch in the 1930s. Various topics such as errors-in-variables,
   factor analysis, and instrumental variables all refer to alternative
   viewpoints on this problem and on ways to account for the anticipated
   way that noise enters the data. In the present paper we begin by
   describing certain fundamental contributions by the founders of the
   field and provide alternative modern proofs to certain key results. We
   then go on to consider a modern viewpoint and novel numerical techniques
   to the problem. The central theme is expressed by the Frisch-Kalman
   dictum, which calls for identifying a noise contribution that allows a
   maximal number of simultaneous linear relations among the noise-free
   variables-a rank minimization problem. In the years since Frisch's
   original formulation, there have been several insights, including trace
   minimization as a convenient heuristic to replace rank minimization. We
   discuss convex relaxations and theoretical bounds on the rank that, when
   met, provide guarantees for global optimality. A complementary point of
   view to this minimum-rank dictum is presented in which models are sought
   leading to a uniformly optimal quadratic estimation error for the
   error-free variables. Points of contact between these formalisms are
   discussed, and alternative regularization schemes are presented.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated the extraordinary optical transmission of terahertz
   waves through an array of nanogaps with varying dimensions and
   periodicities, and used this platform to demonstrate terahertz sensing
   of a thin film of single-walled carbon nanotubes. We have used atomic
   layer lithography to fabricate periodic arrays of nanogap loops that
   have a gap size of 2 nm and a loop length of 100 mu m (aspect ratio of
   50 000). These sub-mm-scale loops of nanogaps can sustain terahertz
   electromagnetic resonances along the contour. We have characterized the
   transmission of terahertz waves through the nanogap arrays and
   investigated the influence of inter-gap electromagnetic coupling as the
   array periodicity shrinks from 100 mm to 4 mm. While the gaps occupy
   only 0.1\% of the surface area, we have measured an amplitude (vertical
   bar E vertical bar) transmittance of over 50\% due to the strong and
   broadband field enhancement inside the nanogaps. The absolute
   transmission through the 2 nm gaps along the rectangular loops can be
   boosted up to 25\%, while it is only 1\% for annular gaps with the same
   perimeter. Furthermore, the extremely tight field confinement and strong
   field enhancement near the 2 nm gap lead to 43\% extinction of THz waves
   in a 10 nm-thick film of single-walled carbon nanotubes over the gaps.
   On the other hand, THz extinction by the same nanotube film on a bare
   glass substrate is only 2\%. These nanogaps pave the way toward
   developing sensitive terahertz detectors for biological and chemical
   targets.}},

Abstract = {{Activatable photoacoustic probes hold great promise for in vivo imaging
   of enzyme activity as they exhibit high contrast and high selectivity at
   depths similar to that of ultrasound imaging. Here we report the
   synthesis and testing of a matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) specific
   peptide probe capable of changing its transient photoacoustic lifetime
   from short to long after activation. The intact probe comprises an
   enzyme-specific cleavable sequence conjugated to a pair of methylene
   blue (MB) molecules that dimerize due to forced proximity, resulting in
   static quenching. Upon cleavage, the MB molecules dissociate and recover
   their intrinsic excited-state lifetime of more than 2 mu s. We
   demonstrated using a pump-probe photoacoustic imaging approach that the
   cleaved probe exhibits a transient signal with lifetime comparable to
   that of MB monomers, whereas no lifetime was detected for the intact
   probe. This could allow for detection of the cleaved probe in the
   presence of high levels of intact probe as well as short transients due
   to endogenous tissue absorbers, thereby providing high contrast and low
   background noise. Finally, we have compared peptide sequences of varying
   length and structure using absorption spectrometry in order to select
   the probe best suited for our imaging needs. Our results suggest that
   both factors could potentially have an impact on dimerization efficiency
   and the cleavage rate of the peptide. However, all probes provided a
   high degree of dimerization and efficient separation after cleavage,
   indicating that a lifetime-based activatable peptide can be constructed
   for in vivo applications using a two-wavelength imaging approach.}},

Abstract = {{The oxygen partial pressure (pO(2)), which results from the balance
   between oxygen delivery and its consumption, is a key component of the
   physiological state of a tissue. Images of oxygen distribution can
   provide essential information for identifying hypoxic tissue and
   optimizing cancer treatment. Previously, we have reported a noninvasive
   in vivo imaging modality based on photoacoustic lifetime. The technique
   maps the excited triplet state of oxygen-sensitive dye, thus reflects
   the spatial and temporal distribution of tissue oxygen. We have applied
   PALI on tumor on small animals to identify hypoxia area. We also showed
   that PALI is able monitor changes of tissue oxygen, in an acute ischemia
   and breathing modulation model.
   Here we present our work on developing a treatment/imaging modality
   (PDT-PALI) that integrates PDT and a combined ultrasound/photoacoustic
   imaging system. The system provides real-time feedback of three
   essential parameters namely: tissue oxygen, light penetration in tumor
   location, and distribution of photosensitizer. Tissue oxygen imaging is
   performed by applying PALI, which relies on photoacoustic probing of
   oxygen-dependent, excitation lifetime of Methylene Blue (MB)
   photosensitizer. Lifetime information can also be used to generate image
   showing the distribution of photosensitizer. The level and penetration
   depth of PDT illumination can be deduced from photoacoustic imaging at
   the same wavelength. All images will be combined with ultrasound B-mode
   images for anatomical reference.
   We expect that PDT efficacy can be improved by applying PALI imaging
   feedback in real-time to determine, and individually optimize,
   O-2-enriched gas breathing parameters and PDT light-dose during
   treatment.}},

   simulation: performance evaluation}},
Journal = {{GEOSCIENTIFIC MODEL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Pages = {{957-973}},
Abstract = {{We present results from and evaluate the performance of a 12-month, 12
   km horizontal resolution year 2005 air pollution simulation for the
   contiguous United States using the WRF-Chem (Weather Research and
   Forecasting with Chemistry) meteorology and chemical transport model
   (CTM). We employ the 2005 US National Emissions Inventory, the Regional
   Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM), and the Modal Aerosol Dynamics
   Model for Europe (MADE) with a volatility basis set (VBS) secondary
   aerosol module. Overall, model performance is comparable to contemporary
   modeling efforts used for regulatory and health-effects analysis, with
   an annual average daytime ozone (O-3) mean fractional bias (MFB) of 12\%
   and an annual average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) MFB of 1 \%.
   WRF-Chem, as configured here, tends to overpredict total PM2.5 at some
   high concentration locations and generally overpredicts average 24 h O-3
   concentrations. Performance is better at predicting daytime-average and
   daily peak O-3 concentrations, which are more relevant for regulatory
   and health effects analyses relative to annual average values.
   Predictive performance for PM2.5 subspecies is mixed: the model
   overpredicts particulate sulfate (MFB = 36 \%), underpredicts
   particulate nitrate (MFB = 110 \%) and organic carbon (MFB = 29 \%), and
   relatively accurately predicts particulate ammonium (MFB = 3 \%) and
   elemental carbon (MFB = 3 \%), so that the accuracy in total PM2.5
   predictions is to some extent a function of offsetting over-and
   underpredictions of PM2.5 subspecies. Model predictive performance for
   PM2.5 and its subspecies is in general worse in winter and in the
   western US than in other seasons and regions, suggesting spatial and
   temporal opportunities for future WRF-Chem model development and
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{We studied coherent beam combining in a specific laser cavity
   architecture in which two Ytterbium-doped fiber amplifiers are passively
   coupled using a homemade binary phase Dammann grating. Our experimental
   results show that coherent beam combining is robust against phase
   perturbation in such a laser cavity architecture when the operating
   point is sufficiently above the lasing threshold. We observed
   redistribution of energy within the supermode of this laser cavity in
   response to an externally applied path length error. The energy
   redistribution is accompanied by an internal differential phase shift
   between the coherently coupled gain arms. Self-phasing mitigates or even
   completely neutralizes the externally applied optical path length error.
   We identify the physical origin of the observed self-phasing with the
   resonant (gain related) nonlinearity in the gain elements under our

Abstract = {{Active interfacial microrheology is a sensitive tool to detect phase
   transitions and headgroup order in phospholipid monolayers. The
   re-orientation of a magnetic nickel nanorod is used to explore changes
   in the surface rheology of
   1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DLPE) and
   1,2-dimyristoyl-sn- glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DMPE), which differ
   by two CH2 groups in their alkyl chains. Phosphatidylethanolamines such
   as DLPE and DMPE are a major component of cell membranes in bacteria and
   in the nervous system. At room temperature, DLPE has a liquid expanded
   (LE) phase for surface pressure, Pi < similar to 38 mN m(-1); DMPE has
   an LE phase for Pi < similar to 7 mN m(-1). In their respective LE
   phases, DLPE and DMPE show no measurable change in surface viscosity
   with P, consistent with a surface viscosity <10(-9) N s m(-1), the
   resolution of our technique. However, there is a measurable,
   discontinuous change in the surface viscosity at the LE to liquid
   condensed (LC) transition for both DLPE and DMPE. This discontinuous
   change is correlated with a significant increase in the surface
   compressibility modulus (or isothermal two-dimensional bulk modulus). In
   the LC phase of DMPE there is an exponential increase in surface
   viscosity with P consistent with a two-dimensional free area model. The
   second-order LC to solid (S) transition in DMPE is marked by an abrupt
   onset of surface elasticity; there is no measurable elasticity in the LC
   phase. A measurable surface elasticity in the S phase suggests a change
   in the molecular ordering or interactions of the DMPE headgroups that is
   not reflected in isotherms or in grazing incidence X-ray diffraction.
   This onset of measurable elasticity is also seen in DLPE, even though no
   indication of a LC-S transition is visible in the isotherms.}},

Title = {{On the scale-to-scale coupling between a full-scale wind turbine and
   turbulence}},

Abstract = {{The scale-dependent response of an instrumented full-scale wind turbine
   is studied under neutrally stratified conditions. The analysis is
   focused on the linkage between the incoming flow, turbine power output
   and foundation strain. Wind speed, measured from sonic anemometers
   installed on a meteorological tower, and foundation strain were sampled
   at 20 Hz, while the turbine power was sampled at 1 Hz. A wavelet
   framework and structure function are used to obtain cross correlations
   among flow turbulence, turbine power and strain across scales as well as
   to quantify intermittent signatures in both flow and turbine quantities.
   Results indicate that correlation between the streamwise velocity
   component of the wind flow and turbine power is maximised across all
   scales larger than the rotor radius for wind measured at the turbine hub
   height. The characteristic time lag associated with maximum correlation
   is shown to be consistent with the Taylor's hypothesis for turbulent
   scales smaller than the separation between the meteorological tower and
   the turbine. However, it decreases with increasing scale size and
   diminishes to zero at scales on the order of the boundary layer
   thickness. Turbine power and strain fluctuations exhibited practically
   the same behaviour at scales larger than two rotor diameters. At those
   scales, the cross correlation between these quantities resulted similar
   to 0.99 and remains still over 0.9 at the scale of rotor radius. Below
   this scale, the correlation decreases logarithmically with scale. The
   strong linkage between power and strain for all the relevant scales
   would eventually allow the analysis of dynamic forcing on the foundation
   based on the power output. Intermittency on the flow is shown to be
   transferred and amplified by the turbine, leading to highly intermittent
   power output.}},
