Abstract = {{We consider the joint power and admission control problem for a wireless
   network consisting of multiple interfering links. The goal is to support
   a maximum number of links at their specified signal to interference plus
   noise ratio (SINR) targets while using a minimum total transmission
   power. In this work, we first reformulate this NP-hard problem as a
   sparse sic-minimization problem and then relax it to a linear program.
   Furthermore, we derive two easy-to-check necessary conditions for all
   links in the network to be simultaneously supported at their target SINR
   levels, and use them to iteratively remove strong interfering links (
   deflation). An upper bound on the maximum number of supported links is
   also given. Numerical simulations show that the proposed approach
   compares favorably with the existing approaches in terms of the number
   of supported links, the total transmission power, and the execution
   time.}},

Title = {{Subcellular localization of the APOBEC3 proteins during mitosis and
   implications for genomic DNA deamination}},

Abstract = {{Humans have seven APOBEC3 DNA cytosine deaminases. The activity of these
   enzymes allows them to restrict a variety of retroviruses and
   retrotransposons, but may also cause pro-mutagenic genomic uracil
   lesions. During interphase the APOBEC3 proteins have different
   subcellular localizations: cell-wide, cytoplasmic or nuclear. This
   implies that only a subset of APOBEC3s have contact with nuclear DNA.
   However, during mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down and
   cytoplasmic proteins may enter what was formerly a privileged zone. To
   address the hypothesis that all APOBEC3 proteins have access to genomic
   DNA, we analyzed the localization of the APOBEC3 proteins during
   mitosis. We show that APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C and APOBEC3H are excluded from
   condensed chromosomes, but become cell-wide during telophase. However,
   APOBEC3B, APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G are excluded from chromatin
   throughout mitosis. After mitosis, APOBEC3B becomes nuclear, and
   APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G become cytoplasmic. Both structural
   motifs as well as size may be factors in regulating chromatin exclusion.
   Deaminase activity was not dependent on cell cycle phase. We also
   analyzed APOBEC3-induced cell cycle perturbations as a measure of each
   enzyme's capacity to inflict genomic DNA damage. AID, APOBEC3A and
   APOBEC3B altered the cell cycle profile, and, unexpectedly, APOBEC3D
   also caused changes. We conclude that several APOBEC3 family members
   have access to the nuclear compartment and can impede the cell cycle,
   most likely through DNA deamination and the ensuing DNA damage response.
   Such genomic damage may contribute to carcinogenesis, as demonstrated by
   AID in B cell cancers and, recently, APOBEC3B in breast cancers.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To assess the effect of air versus fluid tamponade on the
   intraocular migration of india ink particles through nonsutured
   transconjunctival 23-gauge sclerotomies in living porcine eyes.
   Methods: Both eyes (n = 20) underwent 3-port, transconjunctival,
   23-gauge vitrectomy. An angled trocar insertion technique was used in
   all cases. In each animal, one eye underwent a partial fluid-air
   exchange at the conclusion of the vitrectomy, yielding an air fill of
   approximately 80\% (n = 10), whereas the other was left fluid filled (n
   = 10). After removal of the instruments and trocar cannulae, india ink
   was applied to the ocular surface. Animals were allowed to partially
   recover from anesthesia and resume normal blinking behavior. Animals
   were then reanesthetized, euthanized, and enucleated. Histopathologic
   examination was performed in a masked fashion. The presence and location
   of ink was noted for each identified sclerotomy.
   Results: Ink was identified on the ocular surface in 18 of 20 eyes.
   Sclerotomy wounds were identified in 16 of 20 eyes. Ink penetration was
   seen in 2 of 16 sclerotomy wounds, 1 in an air-filled globe and 1 in a
   fluid-filled globe. In both eyes, the ink was identified along the outer
   one third of the wound. There was no penetration of ink along the inner
   two thirds of the sclerotomy wound or in the posterior segment of any
   eyes.
   Conclusion: In an experimental, in vivo, porcine model, india ink
   migration into angled transconjunctival sclerotomy incisions was
   minimal, regardless of the use of an 80\% fluid-air exchange at the
   conclusion of the case. RETINA 33:566-570, 2013}},

Abstract = {{We consider a distributed optimization problem whereby a network of n
   nodes, S-l, l is an element of \{1, ... , n\}, wishes to minimize a
   common strongly convex function f(x), x = {[}x(1), ... , x(n)](T), under
   the constraint that node S-l controls variable x(l) only. The nodes
   locally update their respective variables and periodically exchange
   their values with their neighbors over a set of predefined communication
   channels. Previous studies of this problem have focused mainly on the
   convergence issue and the analysis of convergence rate. In this study,
   we consider noisy communication channels and study the impact of
   communication energy on convergence. In particular, we study the minimum
   amount of communication energy required for nodes to obtain an
   epsilon-minimizer of f(x) in the mean square sense. For linear analog
   communication schemes, we prove that the communication energy to obtain
   an epsilon-minimizer of f(x) must grow at least at the rate of
   Omega(1/epsilon), and this bound is tight when is convex quadratic.
   Furthermore, we show that the same energy requirement can be reduced to
   O (log(2) 1/epsilon) if a suitable digital communication scheme is used.}},

Abstract = {{A new mass transfer model has been formulated and implemented for
   predicting the penetration of liquid medication into an arterial wall.
   The model takes separate account of the transport of medication in the
   tissue and in the liquid stream. The transport equations take into
   consideration both diffusion and advection. An original lateral
   transport mechanism relating the drug concentrations in the tissue and
   in the advecting liquid stream is postulated and calibrated with
   experimental data from the literature. The special features of the
   mechanism are its non-Fickian nature and the accounting of the affinity
   (binding) of the drug to the tissue. Once established, the model was
   applied by means of numerical simulation to the in-artery distribution
   of Paclitaxel, a drug whose function is to minimize restenosis of the
   artery wall. The application encompassed parametric values of the
   duration of the drug therapy, the viscosity of the advecting fluid, and
   the pressure used to drive the drug into the tissue. It was found that
   the drug concentration at a clinically relevant depth in the artery wall
   varied linearly with the duration of the therapy, increased with
   increasing values of the driving pressure, and decreased for higher
   viscosities of the advecting fluid. In addition to its capabilities for
   predicting drug concentrations during the therapy duration period, the
   simulations also were able to follow the temporal variations of the drug
   distribution after the cessation of the therapy. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The quantification of the renewable flux (i.e. sustainable limit) of the
   hydrologic system is the prerequisite for transitioning from
   unsustainable to sustainable water resources management. The application
   of the Watershed Characteristics Approach to estimate the renewable flux
   of the hydrologic system was demonstrated using Minnesota's (USA) Twin
   Cities Metropolitan Area (TCMA). The methodology quantified the
   relationships between landscape properties and water balance
   characteristics, resulting in the development of functioning
   hierarchical hydrogeological units with corresponding recharge rates.
   This renewable flux is a key quantitative characteristic for the
   assessment of a sustainability indicator. The key indicator of
   sustainable water use is the ratio of the renewable capacity of the
   hydrologic system to the water use by humans and the environment. By
   incorporating water use estimates for the TCMA relative to the
   calculated recharge rates, sustainability indicators for groundwater and
   total flux were calculated for the metropolitan area. As far back as the
   1890s, declines in TCMA groundwater levels have been observed, which
   correspond to the unsustainable groundwater extraction estimates
   identified in the results of this study. The non-stationary
   characteristics of urban watersheds influenced by ongoing land use/land
   cover changes as illustrated in this paper, emphasizes the need for
   conservative hydrologic planning to achieve sustainable water
   management. This approach can also be applied to other metropolitan
   areas as a hydrologic tool for decision-makers to design sustainable
   water policy and prevent the over-extraction of the water flowing
   through the hydrologic system.}},

Abstract = {{Document clustering has been recognized as a central problem in text
   data management. Such a problem becomes particularly challenging when
   document contents are characterized by subtopical discussions that are
   not necessarily relevant to each other. Existing methods for document
   clustering have traditionally assumed that a document is an indivisible
   unit for text representation and similarity computation, which may not
   be appropriate to handle documents with multiple topics. In this paper,
   we address the problem of multi-topic document clustering by leveraging
   the natural composition of documents in text segments that are coherent
   with respect to the underlying subtopics. We propose a novel document
   clustering framework that is designed to induce a document organization
   from the identification of cohesive groups of segment-based portions of
   the original documents. We empirically give evidence of the significance
   of our segment-based approach on large collections of multi-topic
   documents, and we compare it to conventional methods for document
   clustering.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoscale simulation techniques are becoming increasingly important due
   to the interest in complex mechanical problems involving nanomaterials.
   We propose applying the established macroscopic modeling concept of
   distinct spherical elements down to the mesoscale to simulate mechanical
   behavior of carbon nanotube systems. Starting from a microscopic
   description, the important interactions are encapsulated into two types
   of contact models that act simultaneously. Each individual nanotube is
   coarse-grained into a chain of spherical elements interacting by
   parallel-bonded contacts, representing the short-ranged covalent
   bonding. An anisotropic van der Waals model with aligning moments acts
   at the contact between elements located in different tubes to represent
   the long-ranged interactions. The promising potential of the proposed
   methodology to model large scale carbon nanotube assemblies is
   illustrated with several examples, including self-folding of individual
   nanotubes, mechanical testing of nanotube ropes, self-assembly of a
   high-porosity nanotube paper, and mechanical testing of a low-porosity
   nanotube paper. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Increasing frequencies of site-specific mutagenesis and gene targeting

Journal = {{GENOME RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},

Abstract = {{Improved methods for engineering sequence-specific nucleases, including
   zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and TAL effector nucleases (TALENs), have
   made it possible to precisely modify plant genomes. However, the success
   of genome modification is largely dependent on the intrinsic activity of
   the engineered nucleases. In this study, we sought to enhance
   ZFNmediated targeted mutagenesis and gene targeting (GT) in Arabidopsis
   by manipulating DNA repair pathways. Using a ZFN that creates a
   double-strand break (DSB) at the endogenous ADH1 locus, we analyzed
   repair outcomes in the absence of DNA repair proteins such as KU70 and
   LIG4 (both involved in classic nonhomologous end-joining, NHEJ) and
   SMC6B (involved in sister-chromatid-based homologous recombination, HR).
   We achieved a fivefold to 16-fold enhancement in HR-based GT in a ku70
   mutant and a threefold to fourfold enhancement in GT in the lig4 mutant.
   Although the NHEJ mutagenesis frequency was not significantly changed in
   ku70 or lig4, DNA repair was shifted to microhomology-dependent
   alternative NHEJ. As a result, mutations in both ku70 and lig4 were
   predominantly large deletions, which facilitates easy screening for
   mutations by PCR. Interestingly, NHEJ mutagenesis and GT at the ADH1
   locus were enhanced by sixfold to eightfold and threefold to fourfold,
   respectively, in a smc6b mutant. The increase in NHEJ-mediated
   mutagenesis by loss of SMC6B was further confirmed using ZFNs that
   target two other Arabidopsis genes, namely, TT4 and MPK8. Considering
   that components of DNA repair pathways are highly conserved across
   species, mutations in DNA repair genes likely provide a universal
   strategy for harnessing repair pathways to achieve desired targeted
   genome modifications.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops and demonstrates the design and optimization method
   for fixed coefficient Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters using
   sub-threshold circuits to achieve the minimum energy per operation.
   Sub-threshold circuit current, delay, power consumption, energy per
   operation and temperature dependence are modeled theoretically and
   analyzed using Matlab. Then the filter design and optimization are
   presented. With a frequency characteristic of 80 dB magnitude and 9.6
   kHz bandwidth, the 16-bit fixed-point coefficients of the linear phase
   equiripple low-pass filter are generated from Matlab. Canonical Signed
   Digit (CSD) arithmetic is used for multiplierless design to improve both
   cost and performance. The transposed structure and symmetry structure
   are applied to optimize the delay and cost further. Horner's rule is
   used to improve the precision. Tree-height reduction and subexpression
   sharing at Register Transfer Level (RTL) are used for further delay and
   cost reduction. Six versions of the filter with the same group of
   coefficients are designed and synthesized using Design Compiler with a
   65 nm process. Synthesis results show that the area of the final version
   is reduced by 44\% compared with the original design at a fixed
   frequency of 250 MHz, and at the highest frequency of each design, the
   area is reduce by about 23\% while the performance is improved by 60\%.
   These results show the design and optimization method developed in this
   paper can improve both the area and performance significantly. One adder
   from the synthesis netlist is simulated at the transistor-level using
   HSPICE to obtain characteristics of sub-threshold operations. The supply
   voltage varies from 1.2 to 0.08 V and temperatures from 0 to 110A
   degrees C. The experiment results verify most characteristics of the
   sub-threshold models, but also reveal some limitations and defects of
   the theoretical models and previous results. The observations are
   discussed carefully with quantitative and qualitative analysis. For 25A
   degrees C, the minimum energy point for the adder is 0.22 V. Finally,
   the results of the adder are used to estimate the energy per operation
   for the filters. For a fixed frequency of 36.4 kHz at 0.22 V, the
   estimated energy values vary from 4.8 to about 2.7 pJ for the six
   designed filters.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical conductivities of thin films of silicon nanocrystals (4-6 nm)
   exhibit high sensitivity to water vapor. Specifically, water adsorption
   on the surface of silicon nanocrystals films increases their electrical
   conductivity by a factor of 4 at room temperature and an order of
   magnitude at 175 K. The increase in conductivity is reversible and can
   manifest as peaks or hysteresis loops in temperature-dependent
   conductivity measurements even when the measurements are conducted under
   vacuum at 10(-5) Torr and in the presence of only residual amounts of
   water vapor. Hydrogen-terminated silicon nanocrystals are easily
   oxidized to form submonolayer to a monolayer of chemically bound oxygen
   on their surfaces when annealed at 300 degrees C in a glovebox with 0.1
   ppm of water vapor. Annealing under vacuum at 300 degrees C retains
   H-passivation without oxidation. The electrical conductivity of films
   made from hydrogen-terminated silicon nanocrystals is 200 times higher
   than the electrical conductivity of films made from silicon nanocrystals
   with a monolayer of chemically bound oxygen. However, the conductivities
   of both types of films increase upon adsorption of water on the
   nanocrystal surfaces. These findings underscore the importance of
   controlling silicon nanocrystal surfaces in determining the electrical
   properties of their thin films,}},

Abstract = {{Several mutations are required for cancer development, and genome
   sequencing has revealed that many cancers, including breast cancer, have
   somatic mutation spectra dominated by C-to-T transitions(1-9). Most of
   these mutations occur at hydrolytically disfavoured(10) non-methylated
   cytosines throughout the genome, and are sometimes clustered(8). Here we
   show that the DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B is a probable source of
   these mutations. APOBEC3B messenger RNA is upregulated in most primary
   breast tumours and breast cancer cell lines. Tumours that express high
   levels of APOBEC3B have twice as many mutations as those that express
   low levels and are more likely to have mutations in TP53. Endogenous
   APOBEC3B protein is predominantly nuclear and the only detectable source
   of DNA C-to-U editing activity in breast cancer cell-line extracts.
   Knockdown experiments show that endogenous APOBEC3B correlates with
   increased levels of genomic uracil, increased mutation frequencies, and
   C-to-T transitions. Furthermore, induced APOBEC3B overexpression causes
   cell cycle deviations, cell death, DNA fragmentation, gamma-H2AX
   accumulation and C-to-T mutations. Our data suggest a model in which
   APOBEC3B-catalysed deamination provides a chronic source of DNA damage
   in breast cancers that could select TP53 inactivation and explain how
   some tumours evolve rapidly and manifest heterogeneity.}},

Title = {{Quantification of Triclosan, Chlorinated Triclosan Derivatives, and

Abstract = {{When discharged into surface waters via wastewater effluents, triclosan,
   the antimicrobial agent in handsoaps, and chlorinated triclosan
   derivatives (CTDs, formed during disinfection with chlorine) react
   photochemically to form polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins. To evaluate
   the historical exposure of waters to these compounds, the levels of
   triclosan, CTDs, and their derived dioxins were determined in sediment
   cores collected from wastewater-impacted Minnesota lakes. The
   accumulation rates and temporal trends of triclosan, CTDs, and dioxins
   in aquatic sediments were found to be a function of historical
   wastewater treatment operations and lake system scale. Cores collected
   from large-scale riverine systems with many wastewater sources recorded
   increasing concentrations of triclosan, CTDs, and their derived dioxins
   since the patent of triclosan in 1964. In small-scale lakes with a
   single wastewater source, the trends were directly attributed to
   increased triclosan use, local improvements in treatment, and changes in
   wastewater disinfection since the 1960s. In the lake with no wastewater
   input, no triclosan or CTDs were detected. Overall, concentrations of
   triclosan, CTDs, and their dioxins were higher in small-scale systems,
   reflecting a greater degree of wastewater impact. In cores collected in
   northern MN, the four dioxins derived from triclosan are present prior
   to the patent of triclosan, suggesting a secondary source. It is clear,
   however, that triclosan and CTDs are the dominant source of these
   congeners after 1965 in systems impacted by wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{We report in this work real time characterization of enzyme coenzyme
   binding by using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and dual polarization
   interferometry (DPI) analyses. Results showed that diaphorase (DP) and
   lactate dehydrogenases (LDH) had distinct binding selectivity and
   preference over reduced and oxidized states of coenzyme NAD(H). On the
   basis of that, DP and LDH were chosen as indicator enzymes to
   distinguish the specific state of surface-bound NAD(H). The
   transformation between NADH and NAD+ during enzyme-catalyzed redox
   reactions was therefore transduced into variation in interaction signals
   as indicated via the binding status of the indicator enzymes as detected
   with both SPR and DPI. This real time molecule-specific detection
   strategy revealed quick and direct reflection of the state and
   reactivity of the coenzyme, promising a unique way of precise molecular
   interaction analysis.}},

Month = {{FEB 18}},
Abstract = {{We report a direct observation of giant saturation magnetization in
   Fe16N2. By exploiting thin film epitaxy, which provides controlled
   biaxial stress to create lattice distortion, we demonstrate that giant
   magnetism can be established in Fe16N2 thin film coherently grown on MgO
   (001) substrate. Explored by polarized neutron reflectometry, the
   depth-dependent saturation magnetic induction (Bs) of epitaxial Fe16N2
   thin films is visualized, which reveals a strong correlation with the
   in-plane lattice parameter and tensile strain developed at near
   substrate interface. With controlled growth process and dimension
   adjustment, the Bs of these films can be modulated over a broad range,
   from similar to 2.1 Tesla (T) (normal Bs) up to similar to 3.1 T (giant
   Bs). (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Volume = {{392}},

Month = {{FEB 15}},
Abstract = {{Freeze-thaw (FT) cycles can aggregate particles in aqueous paint
   suspensions. To understand the mechanism of particle aggregation,
   cryogenic scanning electron microscopy (cryoSEM) was used to visualize
   the microstructure after the freezing and thawing steps of the FT cycle.
   After the freezing step, cryoSEM images show that the microstructure
   contains ice crystals and particle-rich regions. Adding propylene
   glycol, a FT stabilizing additive, leads to formation of larger ice
   crystals. After thawing, the dispersion structure revealed by cryoSEM
   shows that the particles redisperse only in the paint with the highest
   amount of propylene glycol. The other paints contain clusters that are
   different from the particle-rich regions found after the freezing step.
   Increasing the thawing rate leads to a more dispersed microstructure
   even in the absence of propylene glycol. Analysis of the cryoSEM results
   shows that particle aggregation into these clusters occurs during the
   thawing stage, and slow thawing conditions lead to more aggregation. The
   cryoSEM results reported here are used to propose a mechanism of
   aggregation of particles in the paint. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},

Month = {{FEB 12}},
Abstract = {{Numerous initiatives have been undertaken to circumvent the problem of
   antibiotic resistance, including the development of new antibiotics, the
   use of narrow spectrum antibiotics, and the reduction of inappropriate
   antibiotic use We propose an alternative but complimentary approach to
   reduce antibiotic resistant bacteria (ABB) by implementing more
   stringent technologies for treating municipal wastewater, which is known
   to contain large quantities of ARB and antibiotic resistance genes
   (ARGs). In this study, we investigated the ability of conventional
   aerobic digestion to reduce the quantity of ARGs in untreated wastewater
   solids. A bench scale aerobic digester was fed untreated wastewater
   solids collected from a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment
   facility. The reactor was operated under semi-continuous flow conditions
   for more than 200 days at a residence time of approximately 40 days.
   During this time, the quantities of tet(A), tet(W), and erm(B) decreased
   by more than 90\%. In contrast, intl1 did not decrease, and tet(X)
   increased in quantity by 5-fold. Following operation in semi-continuous
   flow mode, the aerobic digester was converted to batch mode to determine
   the first-order decay coefficients, with half-lives ranging from as
   short as 2.8 days for tet(W) to as long as 6.3 days for int/1. These
   results demonstrated that aerobic digestion can be used to reduce the
   quantity of ARGs in untreated wastewater solids, but that rates can vary
   substantially depending on the reactor design (i.e., batch vs
   continuous-flow) and the specific ARG.}},

Abstract = {{JDF-L1 is a microporous layered titanosilicate. JDF-L1-based composite
   materials have been prepared by melt compounding commercial polysulfone
   together with swollen JDF-L1 at a temperature gradient of 303-340
   degrees C. During the melt compounding process most of the swollen
   JDF-L1 was exfoliated, confirmed by thermal, TEM, and XRD analyses. The
   exfoliated JDF-L1/polysulfone master batch was diluted in polysulfone to
   obtain mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) with inorganic loadings in the
   0-9.5 wt \% range, in which exfoliated JDF-L1 particles were well
   dispersed. The MMMs were applied to the separation of a H-2/CH4 mixture
   with an improved performance as compared to the pure polymer or to
   chemically exfoliated JDF-L1/polysulfone membranes. The best performance
   obtained in this work corresponds to an 8.3 wt \% MMM with H-2
   permeability and H-2/CH4 selectivity of 12.5 Barrer and 128,

   stimulation}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{Seizure control using deep brain stimulation (DBS) provides an
   alternative therapy to patients with intractable and drug resistant
   epilepsy. This paper presents novel DBS stimulus protocols to disrupt
   seizures. Two protocols are presented: open-loop stimulation and a
   closed-loop feedback system utilizing measured firing rates to adjust
   stimulus frequency. Stimulation suppression is demonstrated in a
   computational model using 3000 excitatory Morris-Lecar (M-L) model
   neurons connected with depressing synapses. Cells are connected using
   second order network topology (SONET) to simulate network topologies
   measured in cortical networks. The network spontaneously switches from
   tonic to clonic as synaptic strengths and tonic input to the neurons
   decreases. To this model we add periodic stimulation pulses to simulate
   DBS. Periodic forcing can synchronize or desynchronize an oscillating
   population of neurons, depending on the stimulus frequency and
   amplitude. Therefore, it is possible to either extend or truncate the
   tonic or clonic phases of the seizure. Stimuli applied at the firing
   rate of the neuron generally synchronize the population while stimuli
   slightly slower than the firing rate prevent synchronization. We present
   an adaptive stimulation algorithm that measures the firing rate of a
   neuron and adjusts the stimulus to maintain a relative stimulus
   frequency to firing frequency and demonstrate it in a computational
   model of a tonic-clonic seizure. This adaptive algorithm can affect the
   duration of the tonic phase using much smaller stimulus amplitudes than
   the open-loop control.}},

Abstract = {{Prairie pothole lakes (PPLs) are naturally sulfur-enriched wetlands in
   the glaciated prairie region of North America. High sulfate levels and
   dynamic hydrogeochemistry in combination render PPLs a unique
   environment to explore the speciation of sedimentary sulfur (S). The
   goals of this research were to define and quantify the solid-phase S
   pools in PPL sediments and track seasonal dynamics of S speciation. A
   quantitative X-ray microprobe method was developed based on S Is X-ray
   absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy and multienergy
   X-ray fluorescence mapping. Three S pools pyritic S, reduced organic S
   (organic mono- and disulfide), and oxidized S (inorganic sulfate, ester
   sulfate, and sulfonate) were identified in PPL sediments. No significant
   seasonal variation was evident for total S, but S speciation showed a
   seasonal response. During the spring summer transition, the reduced
   organic S decreased from 55 to 15 mol \%, with a concomitant rise in the
   oxidized S. During the summer fall transition, the trend reversed and
   the reduced organic S grew to 75 mol \% at the expense of the oxidized
   S. The pyritic S, on the other hand, remained relatively constant
   (similar to 22 mol \%) over time. The seasonal changes in S speciation
   have strong potential to force the cycling of elements such as mercury
   in prairie wetlands.}},

Abstract = {{Polyurethane (PUR) rigid foams were prepared from recycled aircraft
   deicing agent (aircraft deicing fluid) with reaction of hexamethylene
   diisocyanate at temperature of 55 degrees C. The effect of
   {[}NCO]/{[}OH] ratio on properties of microscopic structure, cell size
   distribution, compressive strength, apparent density, as well as thermal
   conductivity (k) was studied. Higher {[}NCO]/{[}OH] ratio helped achieve
   better micromorphology, higher apparent density, and compressive
   strength of the PUR foams. With the {[}NCO]/{[}OH] ratio of 0.75 and
   0.8, some shrinking happened during foam rising, causing a decrease in
   total volume of the PUR foam, and leading to higher apparent density as
   well as sharply increased compressive strength. All PUR foams displayed
   good thermal insulation properties in this study. With {[}NCO]/{[}OH]
   ratio increased from 0.7 to 0.8, the k value increased significantly
   from 34.3 to 42.2 mW m(-1) K-1. The k value here was chiefly governed by
   the apparent density of the foams, which was in turn a function of the
   ratio of {[}NCO]/{[}OH]. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Appl Polym

Abstract = {{Epoxidized soybean oil (ESO) and isopropanolamine were used to
   synthesize a new polyol mixture for preparation of bio-based
   polyurethanes. The chemical synthetic route for reaction of ESO with
   isopropanolamine was analyzed by H-1-NMR. The results suggested that
   both ester groups and epoxy groups in ESO had reacted with amino group
   of isopropanolamine through simultaneous ring-opening and amidation
   reactions. Epoxy groups in various situations exhibited different
   reactivity, and the unreacted epoxy groups were further opened by
   hydrochloric acid. The synthesized polyol mixture had high hydroxyl
   number of 317.0 mg KOH/g. A series of polyurethanes were prepared by
   curing the synthesized polyol mixture with 1,6-diisocyanatohexance along
   with different amount of 1,3-propanediol (PDO) as chain extender.
   Tensile tests showed that yield strengths of the polyurethanes ranged
   from 2.74 to 27.76 MPa depending on the content of PDO. Differential
   scanning calorimetry analysis displayed one glass transition temperature
   in the range of 24.428.7 degrees C for all of the polyurethane samples,
   and one melt peak at high content of PDO. Thermogravimetric analysis
   showed that thermal degradations of the polyurethanes started at 240255
   degrees C. In consideration of simple preparation process and renewable
   property of ESO, the bio-based polyurethane would have wide range of
   applications. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 127:

Abstract = {{A nanopatterning process, named as the embedded mask patterning, was
   proposed and experimentally demonstrated based on the FePt recording
   media. A granular mask layer was deposited on top of a FePt continuous
   film. The granular pattern of the mask was then transferred down to FePt
   layer using reactive ion etching. Since controlling magnetic properties
   is separated from controlling granular nanostructure, FePt grains can be
   reduced by optimizing the mask layer and patterning process only. This
   process is also potentially compatible to any state-of-art vacuum
   process for other electronic devices wafers and heterostructured
   nanoparticles manufacturing. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{While cryosurgery has proven capable in treating of a variety of
   conditions, it has met with some resistance among physicians, in part
   due to shortcomings in the ability to predict treatment outcomes. Here
   we attempt to address several key issues related to predictive modeling
   by demonstrating methods for accurately characterizing heat transfer
   from cryoprobes, report temperature dependent thermal properties for
   ultrasound gel (a convenient tissue phantom) down to cryogenic
   temperatures, and demonstrate the ability of convective exchange heat
   transfer boundary conditions to accurately describe freezing in the case
   of single and multiple interacting cryoprobe(s). Temperature dependent
   changes in the specific heat and thermal conductivity for ultrasound gel
   are reported down to -150 degrees C for the first time here and these
   data were used to accurately describe freezing in ultrasound gel in
   subsequent modeling. Freezing around a single and two interacting
   cryoprobe(s) was characterized in the ultrasound gel phantom by mapping
   the temperature in and around the ``iceball{''} with carefully placed
   thermocouple arrays. These experimental data were fit with
   finite-element modeling in COMSOL Multiphysics, which was used to
   investigate the sensitivity and effectiveness of convective boundary
   conditions in describing heat transfer from the cryoprobes. Heat
   transfer at the probe tip was described in terms of a convective
   coefficient and the cryogen temperature. While model accuracy depended
   strongly on spatial (i.e., along the exchange surface) variation in the
   convective coefficient, it was much less sensitive to spatial and
   transient variations in the cryogen temperature parameter. The optimized
   fit, convective exchange conditions for the single-probe case also
   provided close agreement with the experimental data for the case of two
   interacting cryoprobes, suggesting that this basic characterization and
   modeling approach can be extended to accurately describe more
   complicated, multiprobe freezing geometries. Accurately characterizing
   cryoprobe behavior in phantoms requires detailed knowledge of the
   freezing medium's properties throughout the range of expected
   temperatures and an appropriate description of the heat transfer across
   the probe's exchange surfaces. Here we demonstrate that convective
   exchange boundary conditions provide an accurate and versatile
   description of heat transfer from cryoprobes, offering potential
   advantages over the traditional constant surface heat flux and constant
   surface temperature descriptions. In addition, although this study was
   conducted on Joule-Thomson type cryoprobes, the general methodologies
   should extend to any probe that is based on convective exchange with a
   cryogenic fluid.}},

Title = {{Microscale Fiber Network Alignment Affects Macroscale Failure Behavior
   in Simulated Collagen Tissue Analogs}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A tissue's microstructure determines its failure properties at larger
   length scales, however, the specific relationship between microstructure
   and macroscopic failure in native and engineered soft tissues (such as
   capsular ligaments, aortic aneurysms, or vascular grafts) has proven
   elusive. In this study, variations in the microscale fiber alignment in
   collagen gel tissue analogs were modeled in order to understand their
   effects on macroscale damage and failure outcomes. The study employed a
   multiscale finite-element (FE) model for damage and failure in
   collagen-based materials. The model relied on microstructural
   representative volume elements (RVEs) that consisted of
   stochastically-generated networks of discrete type-I collagen fibers.
   Fiber alignment was varied within RVEs and between layers of RVEs in a
   macroscopic FE model of a notched dogbone geometry. The macroscale
   stretch and the microscale response of fibers for each of the
   differently aligned cases were compared as the dogbone was uniaxially
   extended to failure. Networks with greater fiber alignment parallel to
   the direction of extension failed at smaller strains (with a 6-22\%
   reduction in the Green strain at failure), however, at greater grip
   forces (a 28-60\% increase) than networks with fibers aligned
   perpendicular to the extension. Alternating layers of crisscrossed
   network alignments (aligned +/- 45 deg to the direction of extension)
   failed at smaller strains but at greater grip forces than those created
   using one fiber alignment type. In summary, variations in microscale
   structure via fiber alignment produced different macroscale failure
   trends. To conclude, these findings may be significant in the realm of
   tissue engineering and in soft tissue biomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{New particles formation experiments have been conducted in the
   experimental multiphasic atmospheric simulation chamber (CESAM) smog
   chamber. The nucleation events generated during the dark ozonolysis of
   sabinene were monitored using a neutral cluster and air ions
   spectrometer in the size range 0.8-42nm under simulated atmospheric
   conditions. The measurements show that a significant amount of
   pre-existing clusters exist in the 1-2nm size range even in very clean
   controlled conditions. Numerical modeling experiments indicate that a
   range of 9-67\% of pre-existing clusters can explain, through activation
   by organic vapors, the number of new particles formed when sabinene is
   oxidized, with an increasing contributing fraction for increasing
   condensable vapor concentrations. These findings suggest that
   atmospheric simulation chambers backgrounds have to be carefully
   characterized for their sub-3-nm neutral cluster concentration content
   before nucleation parameterizations can be derived.}},

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional 3-component velocity measurements were made in the
   near wake region of a miniature 3-blade axial-flow turbine within a
   turbulent boundary layer. The model turbine was placed in an open
   channel flow and operated under subcritical conditions (Fr = 0.13). The
   spatial distribution of the basic flow statistics was obtained at
   various locations to render insights into the spatial features of the
   wake. Instantaneous and phase-averaged vortical structures were analyzed
   to get insights about their dynamics. The results showed a wake
   expansion proportional to the one-third power of the streamwise
   distance, within the first rotor diameter. Wake rotation was clearly
   identified up to a distance of roughly three rotor diameters. In
   particular, relatively high tangential velocity was observed near the
   wake core, but it was found to be nearly negligible at the turbine tip
   radius. In contrast, the radial velocity showed the opposite
   distribution, with higher radial velocity near the turbine tip and, due
   to symmetry, negligible at the rotor axis. Larger turbulence intensity
   was found above the hub height and near the turbine tip. Strong coherent
   tip vortices, visualized in terms of the instantaneous vorticity and the
   lambda(2) criterion, were observed within the first rotor diameter
   downstream of the turbine. These structures, influenced by the velocity
   gradient in the boundary layer, appeared to loose their stability at
   distances greater than two rotor diameters. Hub vortices were also
   identified. Measurements did not exhibit significant tip-hub vortex
   interaction within the first rotor diameter.}},

Abstract = {{In the backbone of large-scale networks, origin-to-destination (OD)
   traffic flows experience abrupt unusual changes known as traffic volume
   anomalies, which can result in congestion and limit the extent to which
   end-user quality of service requirements are met. As a means of
   maintaining seamless end-user experience in dynamic environments, as
   well as for ensuring network security, this paper deals with a crucial
   network monitoring task termed dynamic anomalography. Given link traffic
   measurements (noisy superpositions of unobserved OD flows) periodically
   acquired by backbone routers, the goal is to construct an estimated map
   of anomalies in real time, and thus summarize the network `health state'
   along both the flow and time dimensions. Leveraging the low
   intrinsic-dimensionality of OD flows and the sparse nature of anomalies,
   a novel online estimator is proposed based on an exponentially-weighted
   least-squares criterion regularized with the sparsity-promoting
   l(1)-norm of the anomalies, and the nuclear norm of the nominal traffic
   matrix. After recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form
   amenable to online optimization, a real-time algorithm for dynamic
   anomalography is developed and its convergence established under
   simplifying technical assumptions. For operational conditions where
   computational complexity reductions are at a premium, a lightweight
   stochastic gradient algorithm based on Nesterov's acceleration technique
   is developed as well. Comprehensive numerical tests with both synthetic
   and real network data corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed
   online algorithms and their tracking capabilities, and demonstrate that
   they outperform state-of-the-art approaches developed to diagnose
   traffic anomalies.}},

   6-7 mm, which is about 10 times the (largest) grain size. From the
   mixed-mode loading tests, the zone length at peak load increased to
   10-12 mm, and the length was more or less constant forK(II)/K-I =
   5-13\%. ESPI also provided detailed information on the horizontal
   displacement profiles along the damage zone. For center notch specimens
   at peak load, the horizontal (opening) displacement at the notch tip was
   40 mu m, which can be interpreted as the critical opening displacement
   if the damage zone is fully formed at peak. For mixed-mode specimens,
   the critical horizontal displacement at peak load is 60-80 mu m, but the
   vertical displacement is needed to resolve the critical opening and
   sliding components. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)EM.1943-7889.0000488. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{To better understand the pyrolysis of microalgae, the different roles of
   three major components (carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids) were
   investigated on a pyroprobe. Cellulose, egg whites, and canola oil were
   employed as the model compounds of the three components, respectively.
   Non-catalytic pyrolysis was used to identify and quantify some major
   products and several reaction pathways were proposed for the pyrolysis
   of each model compound. Catalytic pyrolysis was then carried out with
   HZSM-5 for the production of aromatic hydrocarbons at different
   temperatures and catalyst to feed ratios. The aromatic yields of all
   feedstocks were significantly improved when the catalyst to biomass
   ratio increased from 1:1 to 5:1. Egg whites had the lowest aromatic
   yield among the model compounds under all reaction conditions, which
   suggests that proteins can hardly be converted to aromatics with HZSM-5.
   Lipids, although only accounted for 12.33\% of Chlorella, contributed
   about 40\% of aromatic production from algal biomass. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Antibiotics and antibacterials are present in water bodies worldwide but
   little is known about their effects on the biological processes often
   used to treat water. In this research, the effect of antibiotics on
   bacterial activity and community structure was investigated by growing
   biofilms in the presence and absence of a mixture of three compounds
   (sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, and ciprofloxacin) in a continuous-flow
   rotating annular bioreactor fed acetate as a carbon and energy source.
   Steady-state, surface area-normalized substrate utilization rates for
   all antibiotic treatments (all at 0.33 mu g L-1, all at 3.33 mu g L-1,
   and 1 at 3.33 mu g L-1 with the other 2 at 0.33 mu g L-1) were similar
   to the control experiments. Higher attached biomass levels in the
   experiments with ciprofloxacin at 3.33 mu g L-1 resulted in lower
   steady-state biomass-normalized substrate utilization rates in
   comparison to other runs. Microbial community analyses via automated
   ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis revealed significant shifts in
   community structure for the experiments dosed with the highest
   concentrations of ciprofloxacin, suggesting that the antibiotic selected
   for more resistant bacterial strains. The results of this research also
   suggest that mixtures of antibiotics at the sub-mu g L-1 concentrations
   typically observed in surface waters are unlikely to affect biological
   process performance, at least in terms of the degradation of easily
   assimilable compounds. Conversely, changes to community structure and
   biofilm quantity might be expected with ciprofloxacin at mu g L-1
   concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights}},

Abstract = {{Water quality in watersheds is severely impacted by nutrient enrichment
   as a result of agricultural activities. Understanding hydrological
   effects on P dynamics can optimize the ecological function of riparian
   wetlands to reduce nonpoint source pollution. The XiaZhuHu wetlands were
   selected for field P investigation, and two typical hydrological batch
   studies of 35 d each (a static column observation simulating the dry
   season, and a steady-flow flume observation simulating the rainy season)
   were conducted to understand sediment P dynamics and evaluate capacity
   of P immobilization. The average equilibrium P concentration of 0.02 mg
   L-1 among the 31 sampled sediments was generally lower than the average
   dissolved reactive P concentrations in the overlying water, indicating
   an ecological role as a P sink. In static simulation observation, there
   was a fast-pace sorption process during the first 3 d followed by a
   slower paced process, and the mass of P adsorbed per unit sediment
   surface (MPAS) reached 0.16 mg cm(-2). The temporal curves of P
   equilibrium between flowthrough water and top sediment (5 cm) were
   characterized as a quasi ``V{''}-pattern, and the MPAS ranged from -0.04
   to 0.46 mg cm(-2) during the steady-flow observation. The newly-trapped
   P was mainly found in Al-bound P and subsequently as Fe-bound P, which
   would be helpful for sediment P immobilization. Based on our findings,
   the sediment of the tested wetlands could retain external P from
   agricultural land by as much as 10-30 times the area of itself, which
   accounts for approximately 3.3-10\% of the watershed area. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Although existing flooding protocols can provide efficient and reliable
   communication in wireless sensor networks on some level, further
   performance improvement has been hampered by the assumption of link
   independence, which requires costly acknowledgments (ACKs) from every

   exploits the link correlation to achieve flooding reliability using the
   concept of collective ACKs. CF requires only 1-hop information at each
   node, making the design highly distributed and scalable with low
   complexity. We evaluate CF extensively in real-world settings, using
   three different types of testbeds: a single-hop network with 20 MICAz
   nodes, a multihop network with 37 nodes, and a linear outdoor network
   with 48 nodes along a 326-m-long bridge. System evaluation and extensive
   simulation show that CF achieves the same reliability as
   state-of-the-art solutions while reducing the total number of packet
   transmission and the dissemination delay by 30\%-50\% and 35\%-50\%,

Volume = {{21}},

Abstract = {{Various applications in wireless networks, such as routing and query
   processing, can be formulated as random walks on graphs. Many results
   have been obtained for such applications by utilizing the theory of
   random walks (or spectral graph theory), which is mostly developed for
   undirected graphs. However, this formalism neglects the fact that the
   underlying (wireless) networks in practice contain asymmetric links,
   which are best characterized by directed graphs (digraphs). Therefore,
   random walk on digraphs is a more appropriate model to consider for such
   networks. In this paper, by generalizing the random walk theory (or
   spectral graph theory) that has been primarily developed for undirected
   graphs to digraphs, we show how various transmission costs in wireless
   networks can be formulated in terms of hitting times and cover times of
   random walks on digraphs. Using these results, we develop a unified
   theoretical framework for estimating various transmission costs in
   wireless networks. Our framework can be applied to random walk query
   processing strategy and the three routing paradigms-best path routing,
   opportunistic routing, and stateless routing-to which nearly all
   existing routing protocols belong. Extensive simulations demonstrate
   that the proposed digraph-based analytical model can achieve more
   accurate transmission cost estimation over existing methods.}},

Title = {{Onset of whipping in the melt blowing process}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NON-NEWTONIAN FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{192}},
Pages = {{37-47}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Melt blowing is a common process for the production of polymer fibers,
   but its effectiveness can be greatly influenced by the occurrence of
   fiber whipping. This paper reports the results of a systematic
   parametric study aimed at elucidating the factors that determine the
   onset of whipping in the melt blowing process. A quasi-one-dimensional
   model developed by Yarin and co-workers {[}J. Appl. Phys. 108 (2010)
   034913] is analyzed in detail and extended to consider the influence of
   different constitutive models. It is found that whipping requires
   sufficiently large levels of inertia in the fiber and air, as well as a
   strong inlet perturbation. Strong longitudinal stresses along the jet
   axis are required too, although elasticity is not necessary. Also
   essential are a drag force that varies along the fiber length, and an
   air velocity that decreases in magnitude away from the fiber centerline.
   Comparison of results from several different constitutive models
   suggests that melt inertia rather than melt rheology is the more
   dominant factor in controlling fiber shapes. The results of the present
   work are expected to be helpful for the development of more
   quantitatively accurate models of the melt blowing process. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that a semiactive automotive suspension
   system can provide significant benefits compared to a passive suspension
   but cannot quite match the performance of a fully active system. The
   advantage of the semiactive system over an active system is that it
   consumes almost zero energy by utilizing a variable damper whose damping
   coefficient is changed in real time, while a fully active suspension
   consumes significant power for its operation. This paper explores a new
   zero-energy active suspension system that combines the advantages of
   semiactive and active suspensions by providing the performance of the
   active system at zero energy cost. Unlike a semiactive system in which
   the energy is always dissipated, the proposed system harvests and
   recycles energy to achieve active operation. An electrical
   motor-generator is used as the zero-energy actuator and a controller and
   energy management system are developed. An energy adaptive sky-hook gain
   is proposed to prevent the system from running out of energy, thereby
   eliminating the need to switch between passive and active systems. The
   results show that the system performs at least as well as a passive
   system for all frequencies, and is equivalent to an active system for a
   broad range of frequencies including both resonant frequencies. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Degenerative disc disease is commonly a multilevel
   pathology with varying deterioration severity. The use of fusion on
   multiple levels can significantly affect functionality and has been
   linked to persistent adjacent disc degeneration. A hybrid approach of
   fusion and nucleus replacement (NR) has been suggested as a solution for
   mildly degenerated yet painful levels adjacent to fusion.
   PURPOSE: To compare the biomechanical metrics of different hybrid
   implant constructs, hypothesizing that an NR+fusion hybrid would be
   similar to a single-level fusion and perform more naturally compared
   with a two-level fusion.
   STUDY DESIGN: A cadaveric in vitro repeated-measures study was performed
   to evaluate a multilevel lumbar NR+fusion hybrid.
   METHODS: Eight cadaveric spines (L3-S1) were tested in a Spine Kinetic
   Simulator (Instron, Norwood, MA, USA). Pure moments of 8 Nm were applied
   in flexion/extension, lateral bending, and axial rotation as well as
   compression loading. Specimens were tested intact; fused (using
   trans-foraminal lumbar interbody fusion instrumentation with posterior
   rods) at L5-S1; with a nuclectomy at L4-L5 including fusion at L5-S1;
   with NR at L4-L5 including fusion at L5-S1; and finally with a two-level
   fusion spanning L4-S1. Repeated-measures analysis of variance and
   corrected t tests were used to statistically compare outcomes.
   RESULTS: The NR+fusion hybrid and single-level fusion exhibited no
   statistical differences for range of motion (ROM), stiffness, neutral
   zone, and NR+fusion pressure in all loading directions. Compared with
   two-level fusion, the hybrid affords the construct 41.9\% more ROM on
   average. Two-level fusion stiffness was statistically higher than all
   other constructs and resulted in significantly lower ROM in flexion,
   extension, and lateral bending. The hybrid construct produced
   approximately half of the L3-L4 adjacent-level pressures as the
   two-level fusion case while generating similar pressures to the
   single-level fusion case.
   CONCLUSIONS: These data portend more natural functional outcomes and
   fewer adjacent disc complications for a multilevel NR+fusion hybrid
   compared with the classical two-level fusion. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{This paper explores the scalability of in-plane and perpendicular MTJ
   based STT-MRAMs from 65 nm to 8 nm while taking into consideration
   realistic variability effects. We focus on the read and write
   performances of a STT-MRAM based cache rather than the obvious
   advantages such as the denser bit-cell and zero static power. An
   accurate MTJ macromodel capturing key MTJ properties was adopted for
   efficient Monte Carlo simulations. For the simulation of access devices
   and peripheral circuitries, ITRS projected transistor parameters were
   utilized and calibrated using the MASTAR tool that has been widely used
   in industry. 6T SRAM and STT-MRAM arrays were implemented with
   aggressive assist schemes to mimic industrial memory designs. A constant
   J(C0) . RA/VDD scaling scenario was used which to the first order gives
   the optimal balance between read and write margins of STT-MRAMs. The
   thermal stability factor ensuring a 10 year retention time was obtained
   by adjusting the free layer thickness as well as assuming improvement in
   the crystalline anisotropy. Our studies based on the proposed scaling
   methodology show that in-plane STT-MRAM will outperform SRAM from 15 nm
   node, while its perpendicular counterpart requires further innovations
   in MTJ material in order to overcome the poor write performance scaling
   from 22 nm node onwards.}},

Abstract = {{A magnetic microrheometer is used to characterize the development of
   viscosity at different depths in UV-cured epoxy coatings. Lateral

   conditions on the viscosity gradient development, on the rate of
   viscosity increase, and on surface defects are studied. More severe
   gradients develop in thicker coatings and in those with higher
   photoinitiator concentration. Under some conditions, the skin layer
   wrinkles, indicating the development of local compressive stress. Curing
   at higher temperature, however, increases cure rates while reducing the
   viscosity gradients and wrinkling defects.}},

   Models}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{61}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A framework for adaptive and non-adaptive statistical compressive
   sensing is developed, where a statistical model replaces the standard
   sparsity model of classical compressive sensing. We propose within this
   framework optimal task-specific sensing protocols specifically and
   jointly designed for classification and reconstruction. A two-step
   adaptive sensing paradigm is developed, where online sensing is applied
   to detect the signal class in the first step, followed by a
   reconstruction step adapted to the detected class and the observed
   samples. The approach is based on information theory, here tailored for
   Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), where an information-theoretic objective
   relationship between the sensed signals and a representation of the
   specific task of interest is maximized. Experimental results using
   synthetic signals, Landsat satellite attributes, and natural images of
   different sizes and with different noise levels show the improvements
   achieved using the proposed framework when compared to more standard
   sensing protocols. The underlying formulation can be applied beyond
   GMMs, at the price of higher mathematical and computational complexity.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Photoconversion in planar-heterojunction organic photovoltaic cells
   (OPVs) is limited by a short exciton diffusion length (L-D) that
   restricts migration to the dissociating electron donor/acceptor
   interface. Consequently, bulk heterojunctions are often used to realize
   high efficiency as these structures reduce the distance an exciton must
   travel to be dissociated. Here, we present an alternative approach that
   seeks to directly engineer L-D by optimizing the intermolecular
   separation and consequently, the photophysical parameters responsible
   for excitonic energy transfer. By diluting the electron donor boron
   subphthalocyanine chloride into a wide-energy-gap host material, we
   optimize the degree of interaction between donor molecules and observe a
   similar to 50\% increase in L-D. Using this approach, we construct
   planar-heterojunction OPVs with a power conversion efficiency of (4.4
   +/- 0.3)\%, >30\% larger than the case of optimized devices containing
   an undiluted donor layer. The underlying correlation between L-D and the
   degree of molecular interaction has wide implications for the design of
   both OPV active materials and device architectures.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: For patients with thrombocytopenia without bleeding risk
   factors, a platelet transfusion trigger of 10x109/L is recommended. No
   studies have evaluated the clinicians' decision-making process leading
   to trigger changes. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We report on the
   evaluation of trigger changes and the relation with bleeding. Eighty
   patients previously enrolled in the SPRINT trial represent the patient
   population for the current analysis. RESULTS: Seventy-four patients had
   a starting trigger of 10x109/L. Only a minority of patients treated with
   chemotherapy alone (3/12, 25\%) and autologous transplant (6/15, 40\%)
   had a change in their trigger in contrast to the majority of allogeneic
   transplant (37/47, 79\%; p=0.001 and p=0.009, respectively, when
   compared to allogeneic transplant group). Bleeding was the main reason
   reported by clinicians for a trigger change, but the occurrence of
   significant bleeding (Grade 2-4) was similar in patients with or without
   a trigger change (51 and 54\%, p=1.00). Clinicians were influenced by
   the bleeding system: Grade 1 mucocutaneous bleeding leading to a trigger
   change was overrepresented (71\% of cases), as was Grade 2 genitourinary
   bleeding not leading to a trigger change (57\% of cases). CONCLUSION: A
   universal trigger of 10x109/L may not be maintained in a diverse
   population of patients with their respective bleeding risk factors.
   Because the trigger is changed often, it may not be as effective as
   previously believed.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the interference management problem in a multicell MIMO
   heterogeneous network. Within each cell there is a large number of
   distributed micro/pico base stations (BSs) that can be potentially
   coordinated for joint transmission. To reduce coordination overhead, we
   consider user-centric BS clustering so that each user is served by only
   a small number of (potentially overlapping) BSs. Thus, given the channel
   state information, our objective is to jointly design the BS clustering
   and the linear beamformers for all BSs in the network. In this paper, we
   formulate this problem from a sparse optimization perspective, and
   propose an efficient algorithm that is based on iteratively solving a
   sequence of group LASSO problems. A novel feature of the proposed
   algorithm is that it performs BS clustering and beamformer design
   jointly rather than separately as is done in the existing approaches for
   partial coordinated transmission. Moreover, the cluster size can be
   controlled by adjusting a single penalty parameter in the nonsmooth
   regularized utility function. The convergence of the proposed algorithm
   (to a stationary solution) is guaranteed, and its effectiveness is
   demonstrated via extensive simulation.}},

   anisotropy for bit patterned media (BPM) were evaluated. Continuous FePt
   films with surface roughness of less than 0.3 nm were achieved in
   continuous FePt hard magnetic films, FePt/Fe exchange coupled composite
   (ECC) films and FePt/Fe based graded films. Depositing an Fe-rich film
   on FePt at high temperature was found to form large grains and cause the
   film surface very rough for BPM fabrication. Depositing Fe on FePt at
   room temperature and then annealing it to create graded anisotropy
   through the layer interdiffusion process was demonstrated to fabricate
   FePt/Fe based graded BPM. The continuous FePt films with hard layer
   only, ECC structure and graded magnetic anisotropy were patterned using
   a di-block copolymer self-assemble hard mask method with 25 nm dot size
   over 2-inch substrate. The switching field distribution (SFD) broadening
   and degradation of FePt BPM was studied. The reduction of SFD was

   Conventional perpendicular media and ``soft{''} exchange coupled

   less dependent on reader offset from track center with the AF-SUL.
   Jitter for ECC media is also shown to depend less strongly on reader
   offset than for conventional media. The transition center deviation at

Abstract = {{A laboratory experiment was performed to study the dynamically rich
   interaction of a turbulent open channel flow with a bed-mounted
   axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine. An acoustic Doppler velocimeter and a
   torque transducer were used to simultaneously measure at high temporal
   resolution the three velocity components of the flow at various
   locations upstream of the turbine and in the wake region and turbine
   power, respectively. Results show that for sufficiently low frequencies
   the instantaneous power generated by the turbine is modulated by the
   turbulent structure of the approach flow. The critical frequency above
   which the response of the turbine is decoupled from the turbulent flow
   structure is shown to vary linearly with the angular frequency of the
   rotor. The measurements elucidate the structure of the turbulent turbine
   wake, which is shown to persist for at least fifteen rotor diameters
   downstream of the rotor, and a new approach is proposed to quantify the
   wake recovery, based on the growth of the largest scale motions in the
   flow. Spectral analysis is employed to demonstrate the dominant effect
   of the tip vortices in the energy distribution in the near-wake region

Abstract = {{Thermal stability changes the properties of the turbulent atmospheric
   boundary layer, and in turn affects the behaviour of wind-turbine wakes.
   To better understand the effects of thermal stability on the
   wind-turbine wake structure, wind-tunnel experiments were carried out
   with a simulated convective boundary layer (CBL) and a neutral boundary
   layer. The CBL was generated by cooling the airflow to 12-15 A degrees C
   and heating up the test section floor to 73-75 A degrees C. The
   freestream wind speed was set at about 2.5 m s(-1), resulting in a bulk
   Richardson number of -0.13. The wake of a horizontal-axis 3-blade
   wind-turbine model, whose height was within the lowest one third of the
   boundary layer, was studied using stereoscopic particle image
   velocimetry (S-PIV) and triple-wire (x-wire/cold-wire) anemometry. Data
   acquired with the S-PIV were analyzed to characterize the highly
   three-dimensional turbulent flow in the near wake (0.2-3.2 rotor
   diameters) as well as to visualize the shedding of tip vortices.
   Profiles of the mean flow, turbulence intensity, and turbulent momentum
   and heat fluxes were measured with the triple-wire anemometer at
   downwind locations from 2-20 rotor diameters in the centre plane of the
   wake. In comparison with the wake of the same wind turbine in a neutral
   boundary layer, a smaller velocity deficit (about 15 \% at the wake
   centre) is observed in the CBL, where an enhanced radial momentum
   transport leads to a more rapid momentum recovery, particularly in the
   lower part of the wake. The velocity deficit at the wake centre decays
   following a power law regardless of the thermal stability. While the
   peak turbulence intensity (and the maximum added turbulence) occurs at
   the top-tip height at a downwind distance of about three rotor diameters
   in both cases, the magnitude is about 20 \% higher in the CBL than in
   the neutral boundary layer. Correspondingly, the turbulent heat flux is
   also enhanced by approximately 25 \% in the lower part of the wake,
   compared to that in the undisturbed CBL inflow. This study represents
   the first controlled wind-tunnel experiment to study the effects of the
   CBL on wind-turbine wakes. The results on decreased velocity deficit and
   increased turbulence in wind-turbine wakes associated with atmospheric
   thermal stability are important to be taken into account in the design
   of wind farms, in order to reduce the impact of wakes on power output
   and fatigue loads on downwind wind turbines.}},

Abstract = {{The addition of montmorillonite clay modified with an alkylammonium salt
   surfactant (i.e., organoclay) to paraffin wax is found to reduce the
   decay in wetting properties associated with its heating in the melt. It
   was previously shown that holding wax in its molten form prior to
   characterization reduces crystallinity when the solid forms. This
   results in the development of microscale amorphous regions at wax
   surfaces, which appear to be more polar given the abundance of methylene
   linkages versus methyl groups. These regions are believed to impact the
   receding angles for more polar liquids almost exclusively. It is known
   that the introduction and exfoliation of a small amount of the
   organoclay greatly enhances the stiffness, strength, and toughness of
   paraffin wax. Here, it is shown that the organoclay also promotes the
   formation of coatings possessing fewer thermal cracks and helps maintain
   higher crystallinity levels. Fresh wax surfaces containing the clay are
   slightly rougher than those without, which produces a slight increase in
   hysteresis. However, the significant drops in receding angles found for
   paraffin wax samples cast from the melt subsequent to heating are
   absent.}},

   the use of an external-inertial reference. This paper presents two new
   sensors to estimate tension in strings without the need for attaching
   any devices on the string or a need for an inertial reference. Both
   sensors employ an array of three capacitive force measurement devices
   and estimate the tension based on these three readings. Experimental
   data show that the sensors can measure tension values up to 100 N on a
   bench-top test rig.}},

Abstract = {{Energy storage is a natural option toward adding the much-needed
   flexibility for integrating higher amounts of wind generation into the
   existing power system. This paper presents field results and analyses
   quantifying the ability and the value of Sodium Sulfur (NAS) battery
   energy storage toward shifting wind generation from off-peak to on-peak,
   limiting the ramp rate of wind farm output, and a strategy to integrate
   the aforementioned goals. The battery can also be considered on a system
   level independent of wind. It is argued that even in its capacity as a
   system resource independent of wind, the battery can aid integration of
   wind generation. Analyses quantifying the value of the battery in the
   energy and operating reserve markets are presented. Financially optimal
   locations to site the battery have also been identified. The presented

Abstract = {{The influence of a traveling magnetic field (TMF) on vertical gradient
   freeze (VGF) growth of cadmium zinc telluride (CZT) is studied using a
   coupled model of magnetic induction, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer.
   Simulations are performed to determine the influences of current, phase
   shift, and frequency on melt flow and growth interface shape. A downward
   traveling electromagnetic wave drives flow downward at the wall, which
   tends to flatten the interface, whereas an upward traveling wave has the
   opposite effect. An optimum phase shift that maximizes Lorentz force is
   found to depend only on system geometry. Large currents (similar to 300
   A) and high frequencies (similar to 500 Hz) make a significant impact on
   interface shape in the absence of thermal buoyancy, but are ineffectual
   under realistic conditions in a 4 in.-diameter ampoule, for which
   buoyancy dominates Lorentz force throughout the melt. The results
   indicate that interface shape in this CZT growth system is strongly
   governed by furnace heat transfer and is difficult to modify by
   TMF-driven forced convection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Infrared tomographic PIV and 3D motion tracking are combined to measure
   evolving volumetric velocity fields and organism trajectories during
   aquatic predator-prey interactions. The technique was used to study
   zebrafish foraging on both non-evasive and evasive prey species.
   Measurement volumes of 22.5 mm x 10.5 mm x 12 mm were reconstructed from
   images captured on a set of four high-speed cameras. To obtain accurate
   fluid velocity vectors within each volume, fish were first masked out
   using an automated visual hull method. Fish and prey locations were
   identified independently from the same image sets and tracked separately
   within the measurement volume. Experiments demonstrated that fish were
   not influenced by the infrared laser illumination or the tracer
   particles. Results showed that the zebrafish used different strategies,
   suction and ram feeding, for successful capture of non-evasive and
   evasive prey, respectively. The two strategies yielded different
   variations in fluid velocity between the fish mouth and the prey. In
   general, the results suggest that the local flow field, the direction of
   prey locomotion with respect to the predator and the relative
   accelerations and speeds of the predator and prey may all be significant
   in determining predation success.}},

Abstract = {{Central auditory processing in humans was investigated by comparing the
   perceptual effects of temporal parameters of electrical stimulation in
   auditory midbrain implant (AMI) and cochlear implant (CI) users. Four
   experiments were conducted to measure the following: effect of
   interpulse intervals on detection thresholds and loudness; temporal
   modulation transfer functions (TMTFs); effect of duration on detection
   thresholds; and forward masking decay. The CI data were consistent with
   a phenomenological model that based detection or loudness decisions on
   the output of a sliding temporal integration window, the input to which
   was the hypothetical auditory nerve response to each stimulus pulse. To
   predict the AMI data, the model required changes to both the neural
   response input (i.e., midbrain activity to AMI stimuli, compared to
   auditory nerve activity to CI stimuli) and the shape of the integration
   window. AMI data were consistent with a neural response that decreased
   more steeply compared to CI stimulation as the pulse rate increased or
   interpulse interval decreased. For one AMI subject, the data were
   consistent with a significant adaptation of the neural response for
   rates above 200 Hz. The AMI model required an integration window that
   was significantly wider (i.e., decreased temporal resolution) than that
   for CI data, the latter being well fit using the same integration window
   shape as derived from normal-hearing data. These models provide a useful
   way to conceptualize how stimulation of central auditory structures
   differs from stimulation of the auditory nerve and to better understand
   why AMI users have difficulty processing temporal cues important for
   speech understanding.}},

Abstract = {{Most IP-geolocation mapping schemes {[}14], {[}16], {[}17], {[}18] take
   delay-measurement approach, based on the assumption of a strong
   correlation between networking delay and geographical distance between
   the targeted client and the landmarks. In this paper, however, we
   investigate a large region of moderately connected Internet and find the
   delay-distance correlation is weak. But we discover a more probable
   rule-with high probability the shortest delay comes from the closest
   distance. Based on this closest-shortest rule, we develop a simple and
   novel IP-geolocation mapping scheme for moderately connected Internet
   regions, called GeoGet. In GeoGet, we take a large number of webservers
   as passive landmarks and map a targeted client to the geolocation of the
   landmark that has the shortest delay. We further use JavaScript at
   targeted clients to generate HTTP/Get probing for delay measurement. To
   control the measurement cost, we adopt a multistep probing method to
   refine the geolocation of a targeted client, finally to city level. The
   evaluation results show that when probing about 100 landmarks, GeoGet
   correctly maps 35.4 percent clients to city level, which outperforms
   current schemes such as GeoLim {[}16] and GeoPing {[}14] by 270 and 239
   percent, respectively, and the median error distance in GeoGet is around
   120 km, outperforming GeoLim and GeoPing by 37 and 70 percent,

   (0.25 <= C-L <= 1.14) and at a Reynolds number of Re = 2.2 x 10(6). Mean
   drag was measured via wake survey (momentum deficit) and with a
   sensitive force balance. Lift was measured directly from the force
   balance. Tests included the cases of complete and partial riblet
   coverage on the wing. Results indicated that riblets could provide an
   overall reduction of skin friction drag, and that the amount of the
   decrease varied with riblet height and geometry. Partial riblet coverage
   appears in some cases more efficient than its complete coverage
   counterpart. The percentage of drag the riblets reduced varied greatly
   and in some cases the riblets were even detrimental to the airfoil. The
   most efficient riblet for a completely covered airfoil was found to be
   the V-groove shape of 100 mu m height. It produced a reduction of
   roughly 6\% in the operational range expected in a turbine airfoil. On
   the other hand, the most efficient riblet size for partial coverage was
   also a V-groove shape and seemed to shift slightly to a smaller peak
   height of 80 mu m. This configuration produced a reduction of roughly
   4\% in the range of angle of attack that is typical for operation in the
   field. The average non-dimensional square root of the groove
   cross-section, l(+), defined in terms of the drag coefficient at design
   angle of attack for the optimum riblet configuration in the fully
   coverage case was found to be l(+) = 10, which is very close to the
   optimum value found for planar surfaces. Based on our results we propose
   a formulation for the optimum riblet size in airfoil considering the
   mean drag coefficient and chord length Reynolds number. Even though the
   optimum full coverage case showed better performance that the partial
   case, the additional drag reduction benefit may be offset by the
   additional application cost. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The liver is responsible for several homeostasis sustaining functions
   and can lose its regenerative capacity when afflicted with various liver
   disorders. Attempts to bridge patients to transplantation entail the use
   of artificial liver devices or cell-based bio-artificial devices.
   Primary hepatocytes are the preferred cell source, but their scarce
   availability and loss of function during extended cultures have led the
   foray for alternate cell sources. Stem-cells present a renewable cell
   source that can be differentiated into hepatocytes for various clinical
   applications including extracorporeal liver devices, drug toxicity
   testing and disease modeling. The path forward includes efforts to
   further enhance the functional maturity of these stem cell derived
   hepatocytes and the relevant technology for scaling up these processes.
   With these in place, stem cell derived hepatocytes have the potential to
   become standard in regenerative liver therapies in the near future.}},

Title = {{Performance evaluation of variable transmission rate OFDM systems via
   network source coding}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Studies related to the network source coding have addressed
   rate-distortion analysis in both noiseless and noisy channels. However,
   to the best of authors' knowledge, no prior work has studied network
   source coding in the context of orthogonal frequency division
   multiplexing (OFDM) systems. In addition, the system performance using
   network source coding schemes also remains unknown. In this article, we
   first propose two variable transmission rate (VTR) OFDM systems by
   utilizing network source coding schemes, and then evaluate the system
   performance of these two proposed VTR-OFDM systems. For the proposed VTR
   single-input single-output OFDM system, we employ the concept of a
   network with intermediate nodes to develop a 3-stage encoder/decoder,
   and the proposed encoder provides three different coding rates from 0.5
   to 0.8. As for the proposed VTR multi-band OFDM system, two correlated
   sources are simultaneously transmitted using the multiterminal source
   coding schemes, and two sources are encoded by different coding rates
   from 0.25 to 0.5. Finally, compared with the traditional uncoded OFDM
   system, the proposed VTR-OFDM systems have at least 1 to 4 dB gain in
   signal-to-noise ratio to achieve the same symbol error rate in the
   additive white Gaussian noise channel.}},

Title = {{Identification of Sleeping Beauty Transposon Insertions in Solid Tumors
   using Linker-mediated PCR}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{72}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Genomic, proteomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic analyses of human
   tumors indicate that there are thousands of anomalies within each cancer
   genome compared to matched normal tissue. Based on these analyses it is
   evident that there are many undiscovered genetic drivers of cancer(1).
   Unfortunately these drivers are hidden within a much larger number of
   passenger anomalies in the genome that do not directly contribute to
   tumor formation. Another aspect of the cancer genome is that there is
   considerable genetic heterogeneity within similar tumor types. Each
   tumor can harbor different mutations that provide a selective advantage
   for tumor formation(2). Performing an unbiased forward genetic screen in
   mice provides the tools to generate tumors and analyze their genetic
   composition, while reducing the background of passenger mutations. The
   Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system is one such method(3). The SB
   system utilizes mobile vectors (transposons) that can be inserted
   throughout the genome by the transposase enzyme. Mutations are limited
   to a specific cell type through the use of a conditional transposase
   allele that is activated by Cre Recombinase. Many mouse lines exist that
   express Cre Recombinase in specific tissues. By crossing one of these
   lines to the conditional transposase allele (e.g. Lox-stop-Lox-SB11),
   the SB system is activated only in cells that express Cre Recombinase.
   The Cre Recombinase will excise a stop cassette that blocks expression
   of the transposase allele, thereby activating transposon mutagenesis
   within the designated cell type. An SB screen is initiated by breeding
   three strains of transgenic mice so that the experimental mice carry a
   conditional transposase allele, a concatamer of transposons, and a
   tissue-specific Cre Recombinase allele. These mice are allowed to age
   until tumors form and they become moribund. The mice are then necropsied
   and genomic DNA is isolated from the tumors. Next, the genomic DNA is
   subjected to linker-mediated-PCR (LM-PCR) that results in amplification
   of genomic loci containing an SB transposon. LM-PCR performed on a
   single tumor will result in hundreds of distinct amplicons representing
   the hundreds of genomic loci containing transposon insertions in a
   single tumor(4). The transposon insertions in all tumors are analyzed
   and common insertion sites (CISs) are identified using an appropriate
   statistical method(5). Genes within the CIS are highly likely to be
   oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, and are considered candidate cancer
   genes. The advantages of using the SB system to identify candidate
   cancer genes are: 1) the transposon can easily be located in the genome
   because its sequence is known, 2) transposition can be directed to
   almost any cell type and 3) the transposon is capable of introducing
   both gain- and loss-of-function mutations(6). The following protocol
   describes how to devise and execute a forward genetic screen using the
   SB transposon system to identify candidate cancer genes (Figure 1).}},

Abstract = {{Ad hoc low-power wireless networks are an exciting research direction in
   sensing and pervasive computing. Prior security work in this area has
   focused primarily on denial of communication at the routing or medium
   access control levels. This paper explores resource depletion attacks at
   the routing protocol layer, which permanently disable networks by
   quickly draining nodes' battery power. These ``Vampire{''} attacks are
   not specific to any specific protocol, but rather rely on the properties
   of many popular classes of routing protocols. We find that all examined
   protocols are susceptible to Vampire attacks, which are devastating,
   difficult to detect, and are easy to carry out using as few as one
   malicious insider sending only protocol-compliant messages. In the worst
   case, a single Vampire can increase network-wide energy usage by a
   factor of O(N), where N in the number of network nodes. We discuss
   methods to mitigate these types of attacks, including a new
   proof-of-concept protocol that provably bounds the damage caused by
   Vampires during the packet forwarding phase.}},

Abstract = {{Two-step thermochemical cycling was achieved using CeO2 with
   sub-micrometer sized macropores, allowing for substantially improved CO
   production at fast cycle rates when compared to nonporous CeO2. The
   effects of porosity, pore order, and packing density were probed by
   synthesizing ceria materials with different morphologies. Polymeric
   colloidal spheres were used as templates for the synthesis of
   three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) CeO2 and nonordered
   macroporous (NOM) CeO2. Aggregated CeO2 nanoparticles with feature sizes
   similar to those in 3DOM CeO2 were prepared by fragmenting 3DOM CeO2
   into its building blocks using ultrasonication. The three templated
   materials and nonporous, commercial CeO2 were tested in thermochemical
   cycles using an infrared furnace. CeO2 was reduced at similar to 1200
   degrees C, and the reduced CeO2-delta materials were reoxidized under
   CO2 at similar to 850 degrees C. The high temperatures required for
   cycling induced changes in the morphology of the porous materials, which
   were characterized by electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and
   nitrogen sorption measurements. In spite of sintering, the macroporous
   materials retained an interconnected pore network during 55 cycles,
   providing a 10-fold enhancement in CO productivity and production rate
   when compared to nonporous CeO2. Additionally, 3DOM CeO2 provided the
   fastest rate of CO production of all tested materials and also retained
   the smallest solid feature sizes. This boost in reaction kinetics
   allowed for extremely rapid cycling with less than a minute required for
   complete reduction or oxidation. Characterization of the porous
   materials also provided some insight into thermal gradients that
   developed in the sample bed as a result of rapid heating and cooling.}},

Abstract = {{We present first-principles results for elastic moduli (bulk, K, and
   shear, G) and acoustic velocities (compressional, V-P, shear, V-S, and
   bulk V-Phi) of olivine (alpha) and wadsleyite (beta)
   (Fe-x,Mg1-x)(2)SiO4, at high pressure (P) and temperature (T) with
   varying iron content (0 <= x <= 0.125). Pressure and temperature
   derivatives of these properties are analyzed. We show that adding 12.5\%
   of Fe in forsterite softens V-P and V-S by similar to 3-6\%, the same
   effect as raising temperature by similar to 1000 K in dry olivine at
   13.5 GPa-the same is true in wadsleyite. This study suggests that Fe is
   effective in producing seismic velocity heterogeneity at upper mantle
   and transition zone conditions and should be another key ingredient, in
   addition to temperature and water content variations, in interpreting
   seismic heterogeneities in the transition zone. The effect of Fe on
   density, elastic, and velocity contrasts across the alpha ->beta
   transition is also addressed at relevant conditions. We show that
   simultaneous changes of composition, temperature, and pressure do not
   affect significantly the relative density contrasts. We also find that
   compressional and shear impedance contrasts result primarily from
   velocity discontinuities rather than density discontinuity. Citation:

Title = {{Relationship between frequency and deflection angle in the DNA prism}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{87}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{The DNA prism is a modification of the standard pulsed-field
   electrophoresis protocol to provide a continuous separation, where the
   DNA are deflected at an angle that depends on their molecular weight.
   The standard switchback model for the DNA prism predicts a monotonic
   increase in the deflection angle as a function of the frequency for
   switching the field until a plateau regime is reached. However,
   experiments indicate that the deflection angle achieves a maximum value
   before decaying to a size-independent value at high frequencies. Using
   Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that the maximum in the
   deflection angle is related to the reorientation time for the DNA and
   the decay in deflection angle at high frequencies is due to inadequate
   stretching. The generic features of the dependence of the deflection
   angle on molecular weight, switching frequency, and electric field
   strength explain a number of experimental phenomena. DOI:

Abstract = {{The effects of combustion phase and fuel on smoke particle emissions
   from a wood stove operated with three different wood fuels and from a
   corn stove were investigated. A single-particle mass spectrometer
   (aerosol time of flight mass spectrometer (ATOFMS)) was used for
   time-and size-resolved chemical signatures and a scanning mobility
   particle sizer (SMPS) was used for online mobility size distributions.
   Markers of particle phase organics and elemental carbon, PM1.5, and CO
   emissions were strongly reduced for the corn stove compared to the wood
   stove. This is because the more controlled fuel and air supply in the
   corn stove result in more complete combustion. NOx emissions and
   particle phase phosphates showed the opposite trend. Marker ions and
   particle types associated with soot and alkali salts such as potassium
   chloride and potassium sulfates dominated during flaming combustion and
   were correlated with increased exhaust temperatures and reduced CO
   emissions. Marker ions of hydrocarbons and oxidized organics as well as
   a particle cluster type with a strong organic signature were associated
   with reduced combustion temperature and increased CO levels, observed
   during start up from cold stove, addition of fuel, and combustion with
   reduced air supply. Two different particle types were identified in corn
   experiments when particles were classified according to mobility before
   they were measured with the ATOFMS. ``Less massive{''} particles
   contained mostly ash and soot and had vacuum aerodynamic diameters that
   were nearly independent of mobility diameter. ``More massive{''}
   particles had aerodynamic diameters that increased linearly with
   mobility diameter, indicating approximately spherical shapes, and were
   hypothesized to consist of organics.}},

Title = {{Adsorption of single polymer molecules in shear flow near a planar wall}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JAN 21}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption of homopolymers from a dilute solution to a planar wall in
   the presence of shear flow is studied using a bead-spring dumbbell
   model. The bead-bead and bead-wall interactions are described by
   generalized Lennard-Jones potentials. A kinetic theory incorporating
   bead-wall hydrodynamic interaction is developed in order to obtain an
   analytical expression for the steady-state dumbbell concentration
   profile. The concentration profile exhibits an exclusion zone in the
   immediate vicinity of the wall, is followed by a peak, and finally
   approaches the bulk concentration far away from the wall. Using the
   analytical expression, the amount adsorbed and the equivalent film
   thickness are studied as a function of flow strength and the parameters
   characterizing the bead-wall interaction potential. Shear flow causes
   migration of the dumbbells due to bead-wall hydrodynamic interaction,
   which leads to desorption. On increasing the flow strength, the quantity
   adsorbed and the film thickness decrease until complete desorption
   occurs. The dependence of the flow strength required for desorption on
   the model parameters is also studied and a scaling law is derived for
   the strong-interaction limit. Brownian dynamics simulations are
   performed to verify the predictions from the kinetic theory. Although
   the theory makes a number of simplifying assumptions, it captures many
   of the key features seen in the simulations. (C) 2013 American Institute

Abstract = {{Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools have been extensively applied
   to study the hemodynamics in the total cavopulmonary connection (TCPC)
   in patients with only a single functioning ventricle. Without the
   contraction of a sub-pulmonary ventricle, pulsatility of flow through
   this connection is low and variable across patients, which is usually
   neglected in most numerical modeling studies. Recent studies suggest
   that such pulsatility can be non-negligible and can be important in
   hemodynamic predictions. The goal of this work is to compare the results
   of an in-house numerical methodology for simulating pulsatile TCPC flow
   with experimental results. Digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV) was
   acquired on TCPC in vitro models to evaluate the capability of the CFD
   tool in predicting pulsatile TCPC flow fields. In vitro hemodynamic
   measurements were used to compare the numerical prediction of power loss
   across the connection. The results demonstrated the complexity of the
   pulsatile TCPC flow fields and the validity of the numerical approach in
   simulating pulsatile TCPC flow dynamics in both idealized and complex
   patient specific models. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We measured real-time exposure to PM2.5, ultrafine PM (particle number)
   and carbon monoxide (CO) for commuting workers school children, and
   traffic police, in Jakarta, Indonesia. In total, we measured exposures
   for 36 individuals covering 93 days. Commuters in private cars
   experienced mean (st dev) exposures of 22 (9.4) ppm CO, 91 (38) mu
   g/m(3) PM2.5, and 290 (150) x 10(3) particles cm(-3). Mean
   concentrations were higher in public transport than in private cars for
   PM2.5 (difference in means: 22\%) and particle counts (54\%), but not
   CO, likely reflecting in-vehicle particle losses in private cars owing
   to air-conditioning. However, average commute times were longer for
   private car commuters than public transport commuters (in our sample,
   24\% longer: 3.0 vs. 2.3 h per day). Commute and traffic-related
   exposures experienced by Jakarta residents are among the highest in the
   world, owing to high on-road concentrations and multi-hour commutes. (C)

Abstract = {{Metallic nanopore arrays have emerged as optofluidic platforms with
   multifarious sensing and analytical capabilities such as label-free
   surface plasmon resonance (SPR) sensing of molecular binding
   interactions and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SEAS). However,
   directed delivery of analytes through open nanopores using traditional
   methods such as external electric fields or pressure gradients still
   remains difficult. We demonstrate that nanopore arrays have an intrinsic
   ability to promote flow through them via capillary flow and evaporation.
   This passive ``nano-drain{''} mechanism is utilized to concentrate
   biomolecules on the surface of nanopores for improved detection
   sensitivity or create ordered nanoscale arrays of beads and liposomes.
   Without using any external pump or fluidic interconnects, we can
   concentrate and detect the presence of less than a femtomole of
   streptavidin in 10 mu L of sample using fluorescence imaging. Liposome
   nanoarrays are also prepared in less than 5 min and used to detect
   lipid-protein interactions. We also demonstrate label-free SPR detection
   of analytes using metallic nanopore arrays. This method provides a fast,
   simple, transportable, and small-volume platform for labeled as well as
   label-free plasmonic analysis while improving the detection time and
   sensitivity.}},

Pages = {{133-142}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing need to develop measures that can characterize
   complex patterns of functional connectivity among brain regions. Graph
   theoretic measures have emerged as an important way to characterize the
   multivariate connectivity between nodes in a network, which have been
   successfully applied to neurophysiologic activity. In this paper, we
   propose a new small-world measure based on advances in both the
   bivariate measures underlying the graph theoretic approach, as well as
   in the definition of the measure for weighted graphs. Specifically, we
   recently proposed a new bivariate time-frequency phase-synchrony (TFPS)
   measure, which quantifies the dynamic nature of the interactions between
   neuronal oscillations with a higher time-frequency resolution than
   previous approaches and is better at isolating relevant activity. The
   proposed graph theoretic measures, weighted clustering coefficient and
   path length, represent a new approach to the calculation of weighted
   graph measures based on this improved bivariate TFPS measure. The new
   graph theoretic measures are applied to two datasets. The first is a
   well-known social network, Zachary's Karate Club. The second application
   contains event-related potential (ERP) indexing the well-known
   error-related negativity (ERN) component related to cognitive control.
   Results indicate that the new measures outperform the previously
   published weighted graph measures, and produces expectable results for
   both applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Anomalous phonon behavior of carbon nanotubes: First-order influence of
   external load}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JAN 14}},
Abstract = {{External loads typically have an indirect influence on phonon curves,
   i.e., they influence the phonon curves by changing the state about which
   linearization is performed. In this paper, we show that in nanotubes,
   the axial load has a direct first-order influence on the long-wavelength
   behavior of the transverse acoustic (TA) mode. In particular, when the
   tube is force-free, the TA mode frequencies vary quadratically with wave
   number and have curvature (second derivative) proportional to the
   square-root of the nanotube's bending stiffness. When the tube has
   non-zero external force, the TA mode frequencies vary linearly with wave
   number and have slope proportional to the square-root of the axial
   force. Therefore, the TA phonon curves-and associated transport
   properties-are not material properties but rather can be directly tuned
   by external loads. In addition, we show that the out-of-plane shear
   deformation does not contribute to this mode and the unusual properties
   of the TA mode are exclusively due to bending. Our calculations consist
   of 3 parts: First, we use a linear chain of atoms as an illustrative
   example that can be solved in close-form; second, we use our recently
   developed symmetry-adapted phonon analysis method to present direct
   numerical evidence; and finally, we present a simple mechanical model
   that captures the essential physics of the geometric nonlinearity in
   slender nanotubes that couples the axial load directly to the phonon
   curves. We also compute the density of states and show the significant
   effect of the external load. (C) 2013 American Institute of Physics.

   by the use of a braze material insinuated into interstices created by

   carried out to validate the operational performance of the device are

Abstract = {{Perhaps one of the most significant achievements in modern science is
   the discovery of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which
   have paved the way for regeneration therapy using patients' own cells.
   Cardiomyocytes differentiated from hiPSCs (hiPSC-CMs) could be used for
   modelling patients with heart failure, for testing new drugs, and for
   cellular therapy in the future. However, the present cardiomyocyte
   differentiation protocols exhibit variable differentiation efficiency
   across different hiPSC lines, which inhibit the application of this
   technology significantly. Here, we demonstrate a novel myocyte
   differentiation protocol that can yield a significant, high percentage
   of cardiac myocyte differentiation (>85\%) in 2 hiPSC lines, which makes
   the fabrication of a human cardiac muscle patch possible. The
   established hiPSCs cell lines being examined include the transgene
   integrated UCBiPS7 derived from cord blood cells and non-integrated
   PCBC16iPS from skin fibroblasts. The results indicate that hiPSC-CMs
   derived from established hiPSC lines respond to adrenergic or
   acetylcholine stimulation and beat regularly for greater than 60 days.
   This data also demonstrates that this novel differentiation protocol can
   efficiently generate hiPSC-CMs from iPSC lines that are derived not only
   from fibroblasts, but also from blood mononuclear cells.}},

Abstract = {{The explicit-hydrogen version of the transferable potentials for phase
   equilibria (TraPPE-EH) force field is extended to various substituted
   benzenes through the parametrization of the exocyclic groups -F, -Cl,
   -Br, -C equivalent to N, and -OH and to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   through the parametrization of the aromatic linker carbon atom for
   multiple rings. The linker carbon together with the TraPPE-EH parameters
   for aromatic heterocycles constitutes a force field for fused -ring
   heterocycles. Configurational bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs
   ensemble were carried out to compute vapor-liquid coexistence curves for
   fluorobenzene; chlorobenzene; bromobenzene; di-, tri-, and
   hexachlorobenzene isomers; 2-chlorofuran; 2-chlorothiophene;

   The mean unsigned percentage errors in the normal boiling points,
   critical temperatures, and critical densities are 0.9\%, 1.2\%, and
   1.4\%, respectively. Additional simulations were carried out for binary
   systems of benzene/benzonitrile, benzene/phenol, and
   naphthalene/methanol to illustrate the transferability of the developed
   potentials to binary systems containing compounds of different polarity
   and hydrogen-bonding ability. A detailed analysis of the liquid-phase
   structures is provided for selected neat systems and binary mixtures.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{117}},

Abstract = {{We consider oxygen interactions with realistic silica surfaces,
   including both experimentally observed nondefective surface
   reconstructions and experimentally observed surface defects.
   Nondefective models include clusters representing the site above a fully
   coordinated surface Si atom and bridging O atoms, and the defective
   models include clusters representing an under-coordinated Si defect, a
   nonbridging O defect, and a ring structure. Energies were obtained for
   the approach of atomic and molecular oxygen to these clusters in various
   configurations by using explicitly correlated CCSD(T)-F12b electronic
   structure theory and the Minnesota density functionals, which were found
   to be in good agreement. The Minnesota functionals were employed in
   binding energy calculations for all of the clusters, considering the
   singlet and triplet spin states for nondefective clusters and doublet
   and quartet spin states for defective clusters. We find that the chosen
   defects are energetically favorable sites for binding. The density
   functional energies were used to extend the empirical ReaxFF(SiO)
   potential for silica, which was previously parametrized for bulk silica
   polymorphs (van Duin et al. J. Phys. Chem. A, 2003, 107, 3803-3811), to
   model the gas-surface interactions represented by the defective and
   nondefective clusters presented here. Interaction energy predictions
   from ReaxFF(SiO)(GSI) agree very well with the density functional
   energies. ReaxFF(SiO)(GSI) can now be employed in reactive large-scale
   molecular dynamics simulations involving oxygen-silica gas-surface
   interactions such as oxide growth and the heterogeneous recombination of
   oxygen occurring on real silica surfaces.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER}},

Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{The valence band occupied state electronic structure of Co1-xFexS2 in
   the region of the Fe/Co 3d bands has been investigated using
   photoemission and spin-polarized photoemission. As measured by using
   spin-polarized ultraviolet photoemission, the surface Fermi level spin
   polarization of Co1-xFexS2 thin films at 50 K, specifically at x = 0,
   0.05, 0.10 and 0.15, was found to be much reduced compared to that of
   the bulk. The spin polarization nonetheless increases with Fe
   concentration. The resonant photoemission spectroscopy provides evidence
   that S bands have a strong resonance at the photon energy corresponding
   to the Co 2p core level, indicating strong hybridization between Co and
   S bands in Co1-xFexS2 (at small x). Similar evidence exists for Fe
   hybridization with the S bands.}},

Abstract = {{Rheology and turbidity measurements were performed under similar thermal
   histories to probe the relationship between thermoreversible gelation
   and phase separation for a set of three methylcellulose (MC) materials
   with similar degrees of substitution (DS) and contrasting molecular
   weights after hydration in cold water. Frequency-independent loss
   tangents were used to identify the gel point (T-gel) in MC solutions
   well over the chain overlap concentration (c >= 10c{*}). Transmittance
   of 633 nm laser light through the solutions revealed that all MC
   solutions cloud upon gelling, with a relative transmittance of 86\%
   closely associated with the gel point. The gelation temperature of MC
   solutions was found to decrease with increasing MC concentration and the
   results for all molecular weights superposed. Using gel and cloud
   points, a phase diagram was constructed which reveals that clear MC
   solutions transition directly into turbid gels. Frequency-independent
   storage moduli of fully developed MC gels scaled with phi(2.3),
   consistent with theory and experiment of entangled systems. Gelation of
   MC has strong dependence on heating rate while the melting of the gel
   has little dependence on cooling rate, suggesting that thermogelation of
   MC proceeded by a nucleation and growth mechanism rather than spinodal
   decomposition.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-fuel reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion
   using port injection of a less reactive fuel and early-cycle direct
   injection of a more reactive fuel has been shown to yield both high
   thermal efficiency and low NOx and soot emissions over a wide engine
   operating range. Conventional and alternative fuels such as gasoline,
   natural gas and E85 as the lower reactivity fuel in RCCI have been
   studied by many researchers; however, published experimental
   investigations of hydrous ethanol use in RCCI are scarce. Making greater
   use of hydrous ethanol in internal combustion engines has the potential
   to dramatically improve the economics and life cycle carbon dioxide
   emissions of using bio-ethanol. In this work, an experimental
   investigation was conducted using 150 proof hydrous ethanol as the low
   reactivity fuel and commercially-available diesel as the high reactivity
   fuel in an RCCI combustion mode at various load conditions. A modified
   single-cylinder diesel engine was used for the experiments. Based on
   previous studies on RCCI combustion by other researchers, early-cycle
   split-injection strategy of diesel fuel was used to create an
   in-cylinder fuel reactivity distribution to maintain high thermal
   efficiency and low NO and soot emissions. At each load condition, timing
   and mass fraction of the first diesel injection was held constant, while
   timing of the second diesel injection was swept over a range where
   stable combustion could be maintained. Since hydrous ethanol is highly
   resistant to auto-ignition and has large heat of vaporization, intake
   air heating was needed to obtain stable operations of the engine. The
   study shows that 150 proof hydrous ethanol can be used as the low
   reactivity fuel in RCCI through 8.6 bar IMEP and with ethanol energy
   fraction up to 75\% while achieving simultaneously low levels of NOx and
   soot emissions. With increasing engine load, less intake heating is
   needed and BUR is required to maintain low NOx emissions. Future work
   will look at stability of hydrous ethanol RCCI at higher engine load.}},

Abstract = {{High frequency transformers (HFT) are needed along with power electronic
   converters to replace line frequency transformers in high power systems
   to increase power density. For the design of HFT, it is important to
   accurately estimate copper losses due to a duty-cycle modulated current
   waveform. The design also requires determination of the optimal
   thickness of winding layers, leading to a minimum AC power loss. This
   paper shows that the Fourier-series method for the loss computation
   requires the consideration of a large number of harmonics, leading to
   considerable computational time in the determination of the optimal
   thickness. A closed form approximate expression for the power loss is
   presented in this paper that obviates any need for a large series
   summation, resulting in a relatively simple computation of optimal
   thickness. Results are validated through numerical computations.}},

Abstract = {{Bearingless ac homopolar machines combine magnetic bearing and
   motor/generator functionality into a single electric machine which
   features variable excitation, high power density at high rotational
   speed, a simple and robust rotor structure, and magnet-less excitation.
   These features make the bearingless ac homopolar machine a promising
   machine for highspeed flywheel energy storage systems (FESS). The
   variable excitation of the bearingless ac homopolar machine has the
   potential to increase the FESS's efficiency by allowing for low
   excitation during periods of free-wheeling and high-speed operation.
   However, the magnetic suspension's position stiffness and current
   stiffness depend upon the excitation level. This dependency must be
   taken into account in the suspension controller or the magnetic
   suspension may become unstable at certain excitation levels. A technique
   for modeling this dependence is presented in this paper and explored
   through 3D finite element simulation. A prototype design is analyzed for
   two rotor structures: one with a square airgap length profile and one
   with an inverted sinusoidal airgap length profile.}},

Abstract = {{Most digital systems operate on a positional representation of data,
   such as binary radix. An alternative is to operate on random bit streams
   where the signal value is encoded by the probability of obtaining a one
   versus a zero. This representation is much less compact than binary
   radix. However, complex operations can be performed with very simple
   logic. Furthermore, since the representation is uniform, with all bits
   weighted equally, it is highly tolerant of soft errors (i.e., bit
   flips). Both combinational and sequential constructs have been proposed
   for operating on stochastic bit streams. Prior work has shown that
   combinational logic can implement multiplication and scaled addition
   effectively; linear finite-state machines (FSMs) can implement complex
   functions such as exponentiation and tanh effectively. Building on these
   prior results, this paper presents case studies of useful circuit
   constructs implement with the paradigm of logical computation on
   stochastic bit streams. Specifically, it describes finite state machine
   implementations of functions such as edge detection and median
   filter-based noise reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Current noninvasive treatments for tinnitus have shown mixed results.
   There have been encouraging developments in using invasive brain or
   vagal nerve stimulation to modulate neural populations driving the
   tinnitus percept. However, these invasive treatments can only be used in
   a small patient population with severe conditions. In this preliminary
   study, we present a new treatment option we call Multimodal
   Synchronization Therapy (MST), which attempts to achieve synchronized
   and localized brain activation without invasive neural stimulation. MST
   combines multiple sensory, motor, limbic, and cognitive inputs to elicit
   activation of multimodal neurons to potentially modulate specific
   neurons driving the tinnitus percept. We present preliminary data in a
   guinea pig model showing activation of somatosensory and auditory
   pathways to alter neural activity within the inferior colliculus, a
   multimodal integration region that has shown pathological changes in
   animals and patients with tinnitus. Electrical stimulation of different
   body locations induced excitatory responses in the inferior colliculus,
   eliciting responses in up to 41\% of all recording sites for a given
   somatic site. Paired somatic and acoustic stimulation resulted in
   enhanced or suppressed acoustic-driven neural activity in the inferior
   colliculus that varied depending on stimulation and recording location.
   Similar modulation effects were observed in the auditory cortex, which
   may relate to changes in auditory perception. Further studies need to
   incorporate multiple multimodal pathways and must also confirm that MST
   can suppress the abnormal neural patterns that directly drive the
   tinnitus percept.}},

   producing a constant transconductance rail to rail Op-Amp input stage

   that overcomes the limitation of the conventional technique. This new
   overlapped transition regions technique has no voltage shifting limit.
   For both N-type and P-type conventional complementary differential input
   pairs, one source follower and one MOSFET are added to control the
   saturation point of current of input pairs. For 1.2V single supply
   voltage, simulation results demonstrate +/- 3.71\% of overall

Abstract = {{This work considers an estimation task in compressive sensing, where the
   goal is to estimate an unknown signal from compressive measurements that

   setting where some (perhaps limited) prior knowledge on the signal,
   interference, and noise is available. The specific aim here is to devise
   a strategy for incorporating this prior information into the design of
   an appropriate compressive measurement strategy. Here, the prior
   information is interpreted as statistics of a prior distribution on the
   relevant quantities, and an approach based on Bayesian Experimental
   Design is proposed. Experimental results on synthetic data demonstrate
   that the proposed approach outperforms traditional random compressive
   measurement designs, which are agnostic to the prior information, as

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel automated system that denoises and segments
   seven sub-retinal layers in optical coherence tomography (OCT) images.
   First, the OCT images are subjected to Wiener deconvolution by varying
   the noise variance from 10(-1) to 10(-15). A new Fourier-domain
   structural error is introduced in this paper, and the deconvolved OCT
   image with the least structural error is selected as the denoised image.
   The properties of the structural error metric are studied, and it is
   shown that the error metric satisfies convexity property. For each
   image, the proposed denoising method increases the image SNR by 6.9 dB
   on average compared to 5 dB increase reported so far, and attains a mean
   peak SNR (PSNR) of 23.036 dB. Next, high-pass filters are applied to the
   denoised images in an iterative manner to extract the seven sub-retinal
   layers. The proposed system requires on average 10.65 seconds for
   denoising an image and 22.07 seconds for segmenting seven sub-retinal
   layers. This is a significant improvement over manual segmentation that
   requires up to 12 minutes per image.}},

   procedure, 98.94\% and 99.78\% accuracies were achieved in classifying
   470 word trials and 450 sentence trials, respectively. The high accuracy
   indicates abnormalities of brain activity during language processing in

Abstract = {{An optimal distributed generation (DG) placement and sizing problem is
   formulated in this paper, for existing three-phase feeders and future
   microgrids. Similar to various optimal DG placement and sizing
   formulations, nonlinear AC power flow relations and binary selection
   variables representing presence (or absence) of DG units render the
   proposed optimization problem NP-hard. Nevertheless, a relaxed convex
   re-formulation is obtained by leveraging semidefinite relaxation
   techniques, and sparsity-promoting regularization approaches. It is
   shown that by adjusting a sparsity-tuning parameter, one can trade off
   attainable system operation efficiency for DG deployment cost. The
   proposed scheme is tested on the IEEE 37-node test feeder.}},

   is the online learning of dictionaries (using only the data itself) to
   sparsely model the background source, which facilitates its separation

Abstract = {{This brief presents a novel architecture for Support Vector Machines
   (SVMs), a machine learning algorithm that performs classification tasks.
   SVMs achieve very good classification accuracy at the cost of high
   computational complexity. We propose a low-energy architecture based on
   approximate computing by exploiting the inherent error resilience in the
   SVM computation. We present two design optimizations, fixed-width
   multiply-add and non-uniform look-up table (LUT) for exponent function
   to minimize power consumption and hardware complexity while retaining
   the classification performance. A novel non-uniform quantization scheme
   is proposed for implementing the exponent function which reduces the
   size of the look-up table by 50\%. The proposed non-uniform look-up
   table reduces the power consumption by 35\% using 10-bit quantization.
   The proposed architecture is programmable and can evaluate three
   different kernels (linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF)). The
   proposed design consumes 31\% less energy on average compared to a
   conventional design. We estimate that SVM computation using RBF kernel
   can be performed in 382.2nJ for 36 features and 5000 support vectors
   using 65nm technology.}},

Abstract = {{Identifying synchronizations could significantly improve testing and
   debugging of multithreaded programs because it could substantially cut
   down the number of possible interleavings in those tests. There are two
   general techniques to implement synchronizations: modularized and
   ad-hoc. Identifying synchronizations in multi-threaded programs could be
   quite challenging. It is because modularized synchronizations are often
   implemented in an obscure and implicit way, and ad-hoc synchronizations
   could be quite subtle. In this paper, we try to identify
   synchronizations from a new perspective. We found that if a thread is
   waiting for synchronizations, the code it executes during the wait is
   very different from that after the completion of the synchronization.
   Based on such an observation, we proposed an effective method to
   identify synchronizations. It doesn't depend on the understanding of
   source codes or the knowledge of semantics of library routines. A system
   called SyncTester is developed, and experiments show that SyncTester is
   effective and useful.}},

Abstract = {{The preferred orientation of CIGS is related to the crystal structure of
   the bottom MoSe2 layer. The lattice mismatch of chalcopyrite (220) CIGS
   to hexagonal (102) MoSe2 is lower than other orientations. The lattice
   mismatch depends on the Ga composition x, reaching a minimum at x=0.35.
   2D dislocation and trap densities were calculated as a function of
   lattice mismatch for various compositions. In good agreement with
   experiment, the best performance CIGS solar cell was obtained at x=0.35
   in this numerical device simulation. The lattice mismatch between CIGS
   and hexagonal CdS can also lead to 2D dislocations in CdS at the top
   CIGS interface. Interface traps saturate the open circuit voltage at
   high Ga composition by a thermionic emission transport mechanism. These
   models well explain observed CIGS solar cell performance over the full
   range of Ga compositions.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous multicore processors that integrate CPU cores and
   data-parallel accelerators such as GPU cores onto the same die raise
   several new issues for sharing various on-chip resources. The shared
   last-level cache (LLC) is one of the most important shared resources due
   to its impact on performance. Accesses to the shared LLC in
   heterogeneous multicore processors can be dominated by the GPU due to
   the significantly higher number of threads supported. Under current
   cache management policies, the CPU applications' share of the LLC can be
   significantly reduced in the presence of competing GPU applications. For
   cache sensitive CPU applications, a reduced share of the LLC could lead
   to significant performance degradation. On the contrary, GPU
   applications can often tolerate increased memory access latency in the
   presence of LLC misses when there is sufficient thread-level
   parallelism.
   In this work, we propose Heterogeneous LLC Management (HeLM), a novel
   shared LLC management policy that takes advantage of the GPU's tolerance
   for memory access latency. HeLM is able to throttle GPU LLC accesses and
   yield LLC space to cache sensitive CPU applications. GPU LLC access
   throttling is achieved by allowing GPU threads that can tolerate longer
   memory access latencies to bypass the LLC. The latency tolerance of a
   GPU application is determined by the availability of thread-level
   parallelism, which can be measured at runtime as the average number of
   threads that are available for issuing. Our heterogeneous LLC management
   scheme outperforms LRU policy by 12.5\% and TAP-RRIP by 5.6\% for a
   processor with 4 CPU and 4 GPU cores.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining the accumulator pressure regardless of its energy level and
   tracking the power demanded by the electrical grid are two potential
   advantages of the Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system proposed
   in {[}1, 2]. In order to achieve these goals, a nonlinear controller is
   designed motivated by an energy-based Lyapunov function. The control
   inputs of the storage system include displacement of the pump/motor in
   the hydraulic transformer and displacement of the liquid piston air
   compressor/expander While the latter has a relatively low bandwidth, the
   former is a faster actuator with a higher bandwidth. In addition, the
   pneumatic path of the storage vessel that is connected to the liquid
   piston air compressor/expander has a high energy density, whereas the
   hydraulic path of the storage vessel is power dense. The nonlinear
   controller is then modified to achieve a better performance for the
   entire system according to these properties. In the proposed approach,
   the control effort is distributed between the two pump/motors based on
   their bandwidths: the hydraulic transformer reacts to high frequency
   events, while the liquid piston air compressor/expander performs a
   steady storage/regeneration task. As a result, the liquid piston air
   compressor/expander will loosely maintain the accumulator pressure ratio
   and the pump/motor in the hydraulic transformer will precisely track the
   desired generator power This control scheme also allows the accumulator
   to function as a damper in the storage system by absorbing power
   disturbances from the hydraulic path generated by wind gusts.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of placing bearing sensors so as to estimate the
   location of a target in a square environment. We consider sensors with
   unknown but bounded noise: the true location of the target is guaranteed
   to be in a 2 alpha-wedge around the measurement, where alpha is the
   maximum noise. The quality of the placement is given by the area or
   diameter of the intersection of measurements from all sensors in the
   worst-case (i.e. regardless of the target's location). We study the
   bi-criteria optimization problem of placing a small number of sensors
   while guaranteeing a worst-case bound on the uncertainty.
   Our main result is a constant-factor approximation: We show that in
   general when alpha <= pi/4, at most 9n{*} sensors placed on a triangular
   grid has diameter and area uncertainty of at most 5.88U(D){*} D and
   7.76U(A){*} A respectively, where n{*}, U-D{*} D and U-A{*} A are the
   number of sensors, diameter and area uncertainty of an optimal
   algorithm. In obtaining these results, we present some structural
   properties which may be of independent interest. We also show that in
   the triangular grid placement, only a constant number of sensors need to
   be activated to achieve the desired uncertainty, a property that can be
   used for designing energy/bandwidth efficient sensor selection schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature cracking (LTC) is a major distress and cause of failure
   for asphalt pavements located in regions with cold climate; however,
   most pavement design methods do not directly address LTC. The Thermal
   Cracking Model (TCModel) utilized by the AASHTO Mechanistic-Empirical
   Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG) relies heavily on the phenomenological
   Paris law for crack propagation. The TCModel predictions are primarily
   based on tensile strength of the asphalt mixture and do not account for
   quasi-brittle behavior of asphalt concrete. Furthermore, TCModel uses a
   simplified one-dimensional viscoelastic solution for determination of
   thermally induced stresses. This paper describes a newly developed
   comprehensive software system for low temperature cracking prediction in
   asphalt pavements. The software system called ``IlliTC{''} utilizes a
   user-friendly graphical interface with a stand-alone finite-element
   based simulation program. The system includes a preanalyzer and data
   input generator module that develops a two-dimensional finite element
   pavement model for the user and which identifies critical events for
   thermal cracking using an efficient viscoelastic pavement stress
   simulation algorithm. Cooling events that are identified as critical are
   rigorously simulated using a viscoelastic finite element analysis engine
   coupled with a fracture-energy based cohesive zone fracture model. This
   paper presents a comprehensive summary of the components of the IlliTC
   system. Model verifications, field calibration and preliminary
   validation results are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Compartment syndrome is a major concern in cases of extremity trauma,
   which occur in over 70\% of military combat casualty. Without treatment,
   compartment syndrome can lead to paralysis, loss of limb, or death. This
   paper focuses on the development of a handheld sensor that can be used
   for the non-invasive diagnosis of compartment syndrome. Analytical
   development of the sensing principle is first presented in which a
   relation is obtained between the pressure in a fluid compartment and the
   stiffness experienced by a handheld probe pushing on the compartment.
   Then a handheld sensor that can measure stiffness of an object without
   requiring the use of any inertial reference is presented. The handheld
   sensor consists of an array of three miniature force-sensing spring
   loaded pistons placed together on a probe. The center spring is chosen
   to be significantly stiffer than the side springs. The ratio of forces
   between the stiff and soft springs is proportional to the stiffness of
   the soft object against which the probe is pushed. Small mm-sized
   magnets on the pistons and magnetic field measurement chips are used to
   measure the forces in the individual pistons. Experimental results are
   presented using an in-vitro test rig that replicates a fluid pressure
   compartment. The sensor is shown to measure pressure accurately with a
   resolution of 0.1 psi over the range 0.75 psi to 2.5 psi.}},

Abstract = {{Combining hybrid powertrain optimization with traffic information has
   been researched before, but tradeoffs between optimality, driving-cycle
   sensitivity and speed of calculation have not been cohesively addressed.
   Optimizing hybrid powertrain with traffic can be done through iterative
   methods such as Dynamic Programming (DP), Stochastic-DP and Model
   Predictive Control, but high computation load limits their online
   implementation. Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) and
   Adaptive-ECMS were proposed to minimize computation time, but unable to
   ensure real-time charge-sustaining-operation (CS) in transient traffic
   environment. Others show relationship between Pontryagins Minimum
   Principles (PMP) and ECMS, but iteratively solve the CS-operation
   problem offline. This paper proposes combining PMP's necessary
   conditions for optimality, with sum-of State-Of-Charge-derivative for
   CS-operation. A lookup table is generated offline to interpolate linear
   mass-fuel-rate vs net-power-to-battery slopes to calculate the
   equivalence ratio for real-time implementation with predicted traffic
   data. Maximum fuel economy improvements of 7.2\% over Rule-Based is
   achieved within a simulated traffic network.}},

   was calculated by accumulating the incremental displacement and
   differentiating along the axial direction, the solution to the new
   equation is shown to be found by using a differentiation-integration
   operator along the axial direction. Using a diagnostic probe and a High
   Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) transducer in Dual Mode Ultrasound
   Array (DMUA) setup the displacement data was collected from
   sub-therapeutic shots on the hind limb of a Copenhagen rat. The results
   of applying the new method showed a temperature change in a 2 mm axial

Abstract = {{Recent works have shown promising results in in vivo temperature
   estimation using diagnostic ultrasound. By applying speckle tracking
   algorithm on the M2D images taken by a diagnostic probe positioned in
   the fenestration of a Dual Mode Ultrasound Array (DMUA), localized
   temperature changes during sub-therapeutic High Intensity Focused
   Ultrasound (HIFU) operation can be detected. However, interference from
   natural motion and deformation of the tissue could result in severe
   errors in the estimated temperature profiles. Two-dimensional filtering
   inspired by the bio-heat equation was shown to partially mitigate these
   effects, but it is ineffective when the spatial frequencies of the
   deformations are within the same bandwidth of the temperature-induced
   strains. We present results of a new adaptive technique which is capable
   of largely suppressing the interference without sacrificing the dynamics
   of the temperature change. The method is based on finding points with
   strong deformation induced strains outside the targeted region before
   the therapy starts and training an adaptive filter with the signals from
   these points as it inputs. During the therapy, the strain data from
   selected points and trained coefficients are used to suppress the effect
   of natural motions using a spatial interference cancellation filter.}},

Abstract = {{The free piston engine (FPE) is a type of internal combustion engine
   (ICE) with no crankshaft, so that its piston motion is no longer
   constrained by mechanical linkages. The FPE has a high potential in
   terms of energy saving given its simple structure, high modularity and
   high efficiency. One of the technical barriers that prevents the wide
   spread of the FPE technology, is the lack of precise piston motion
   control. Previously, a robust repetitive controller is designed and
   implemented to form a virtual crankshaft that would provide a precise
   and stable engine operation. The experimental data of engine motoring
   tests with virtual crankshaft demonstrates the effectiveness of the
   controller. However, the presence of a transient period after a single
   combustion event prevents the engine from continuous firing. This paper
   presents a modified control scheme, which utilizes a reference and
   control signal shifting technique to modify the tracking error and the
   control signal to reduce the transient period.}},

Abstract = {{Automotive transmissions are required to efficiently transfer power from
   the engine to the wheels. Automatic transmissions are one of the most
   widely used transmission systems. This transmission houses a hydraulic
   system that is used to actuate the clutch system to realize different
   gear ratios. Currently, these clutches are primarily controlled in
   open-loop using many valves in a complex control architecture designed
   specifically for a given transmission system in order to perform precise
   pressure and flow control. To meet the increasing demand for higher fuel
   economy, transmissions with greater number of gear ratios are being
   introduced. The hydraulic architecture is becoming increasingly
   complicated with more clutches and control elements. With the
   advancement of MEMS technology, the sensor-based direct feedback control
   of clutches becomes possible. This paper first analyzes the current
   architecture of transmission hydraulic actuation and then presents a new
   architecture for the feedback-based clutches. The proposed architecture
   is further validated through experiments using a hardware-in-the-loop
   system.}},

Abstract = {{Energy management strategies for a hydraulic hybrid wheel loader are
   studied in this paper. The architecture of the hydraulic hybrid wheel
   loader is first presented and the differences of the powertrain and the
   energy management system between on-road vehicles and wheel loaders are
   identified. Unlike the on-road vehicles where the engine only powers the
   drivetrain, the engine in a wheel loader powers both the drivetrain and
   the working hydraulic system. In a non-hybrid wheel loader, the two
   sub-systems interfere with each other since they share the same engine
   shaft. By using a power split drivetrain, it not only allows for optimal
   engine operation and regenerative braking, but also eliminates
   interferences between driving and working functions, which improve the
   productivity, fuel efficiency and operability of the wheel loader. An
   energy management strategy (EMS) based on dynamic programming (DP) is
   designed to optimize the operation of both the power split drivetrain
   and the working hydraulic system. A short loading cycle is selected as
   the duty cycle. The EMS based on DP is compared with a rule-based
   strategy through simulation.}},

Abstract = {{In a cyber-physical system (a system where the physical world interacts
   extensively with-often networked-software), the physical portion of the
   system resides in the continuous and continual domain. Thus, on the
   physical side of cyber-physical systems we will have to contend with not
   only real time requirements but also the continuous and continual nature
   of the system.
   This poses a new set of challenges for requirements engineering; we must
   write well defined requirements to address crucial issues not commonly
   addressed in the software domain. For example, the rate of change of a
   controlled variable, the time it takes for a controlled variable to
   settle sufficiently close to a set-point, and the cumulative errors
   built up over time may be of critical importance. In this paper we
   outline how early modeling in the continuous domain serves as a crucial
   aid in the elicitation and discovery of requirements for cyber-physical
   systems and provide an initial classification of the types of
   requirements needed to describe crucial aspects of the physical side of
   a cyber-physical system.}},

Abstract = {{Many real-world social interactions involve multiple people, for e. g.,
   authors collaborating on a paper, email exchanges made in a company and
   task-oriented teams in workforce. Simple graph representation of these
   activities destroys the group structure present in them. Hypergraphs
   have recently emerged as a better tool for modeling group interactions.
   However, methods in social hypernetwork analysis haven't kept pace. In
   this work, we extend the concept of node degree centrality to
   hypergraphs. We validate our proposed measures using alternate measures
   of influence available to us using two datasets namely, the DBLP dataset
   of scientific collaborations and the group network in a popular Chinese
   multi-player online game called CR3. We discuss several schemes for
   assigning weights to hyperedges and compare them empirically. Finally,
   we define separate weak and strong tie node degree centralities which
   improves performance of our models. Weak tie degree centrality is found
   to be a better predictor of influence in hypergraphs than strong tie
   degree centrality.}},

Abstract = {{As the main catalytic and structural molecules within living systems,
   proteins are the most likely biomolecules to be affected by radiation
   exposure. Proteomics, the comprehensive characterization of proteins
   within complex biological samples, is therefore a research approach
   ideally suited to assess the effects of radiation exposure on cells and
   tissues. For comprehensive characterization of proteomes, an analytical
   platform capable of quantifying protein abundance, identifying
   post-translation modifications and revealing members of protein
   complexes on a system-wide level is necessary. Mass spectrometry (MS),
   coupled with technologies for sample fractionation and automated data
   analysis, provides such a versatile and powerful platform. In this
   chapter we offer a view on the current state of MS-proteomics, and focus
   on emerging technologies within three areas: (1) New instrumental
   methods; (2) New computational methods for peptide identification; and
   (3) Label-free quantification. These emerging technologies should be
   valuable for researchers seeking to better understand biological effects
   of radiation on living systems.}},

Abstract = {{Programmers are taking advantage of the increasing availability of
   on-chip parallelism to meet the rising performance demands of diverse
   applications. Support of tools that can facilitate the detection of
   incorrect program execution when concurrent threads are involved is
   critical to this evolution. Many concurrency bugs manifest as some form
   of data race condition, and their runtime detection is inherently
   difficult due to the high overhead of the required memory trace
   comparisons. Various software and hardware tools have been proposed to
   detect concurrency bugs at runtime. However, software-based schemes lead
   to significant performance overhead, while, hardware-based schemes
   require significant hardware modifications. To enable cost-efficient
   design of data race detectors, it is desirable to utilize available
   on-chip resources. The recent integration of CPU cores with
   data-parallel accelerator cores, such as GPU, provides the opportunity
   to offload the task of data race detection to these accelerator cores.
   In this paper, we explore this opportunity by designing a GPU
   Accelerated Data Race Detector (GUARD) that utilizes GPU cores to
   process memory traces and detect data races in parallel applications
   executing on the CPU cores. GUARD further explores various optimization
   techniques for: (i) reducing the size of memory traces by employing
   signatures; and (ii) improving accuracy of signatures using
   coherence-based filtering. Overall, GUARD achieves the performance of
   hardware-based data race detection mechanisms with minimal hardware
   modifications.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a novel common-mode elimination technique for a
   1V rail-to-rail CMOS amplifier. For 1V single supply voltage, the input
   signal compression technique ({[}1]) is used to avoid the dead zone of
   input stage. Before the conventional PMOS input amplifier, the original
   signal is processed by the common mode elimination block which is
   composed with signal compression block, signal inverting block and 4
   resistors. After this common mode elimination block, the original common
   mode signal variation from 0V to 1V is compressed with about 3.7mV
   variation while the compression rate of differential signal is about
   71.4\%. With this technique, ultra high CMRR (min 115.1dB) is obtained
   with 43.3dB differential gain. Cadence SPECTRE simulator and TSMC
   0.25-mu m CMOS technology are used to simulate this work.}},

Abstract = {{Optical biosensors based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in metallic
   thin films are currently standard tools for measuring molecular binding
   kinetics and affinities - an important task for biophysical studies and
   pharmaceutical development. Motivated by recent progress in the design
   and fabrication of metallic nanostructures, such as nanoparticles or
   nanoholes of various shapes, researchers have been pursuing a new
   generation of biosensors harnessing tailored plasmonic effects in these
   engineered nanostructures. Nanoplasmonic devices, while demanding
   nanofabrication, offer tunability with respect to sensor dimension and
   physical properties, thereby enabling novel biological interfacing
   opportunities and extreme miniaturization. Here we provide an integrated
   overview of refractometric biosensing with nanoplasmonic devices and
   highlight some recent examples of nanoplasmonic sensors capable of
   unique functions that are difficult to accomplish with conventional SPR.
   For example, since the local field strength and spatial distribution can
   be readily tuned by varying the shape and arrangement of nanostructures,
   biomolecular interactions can be controlled to occur in regions of high
   field strength. This may improve signal-to-noise and also enable sensing
   a small number of molecules. Furthermore, the nanoscale plasmonic sensor
   elements may, in combination with nanofabrication and
   materials-selective surface-modifications, make it possible to merge
   affinity biosensing with nanofluidic liquid handling.}},

Abstract = {{In many critical systems domains, test suite adequacy is currently
   measured using structural coverage metrics over the source code. Of
   particular interest is the modified condition/decision coverage (MC/DC)
   criterion required for, e.g., critical avionics systems. In previous
   investigations we have found that the efficacy of such test suites is
   highly dependent on the structure of the program under test and the
   choice of variables monitored by the oracle. MC/DC adequate tests would
   frequently exercise faulty code, but the effects of the faults would not
   propagate to the monitored oracle variables.
   In this report, we combine the MC/DC coverage metric with a notion of
   observability that helps ensure that the result of a fault encountered
   when covering a structural obligation propagates to a monitored
   variable; we term this new coverage criterion Observable MC/DC (OMC/DC).
   We hypothesize this path requirement will make structural coverage
   metrics 1.) more effective at revealing faults, 2.) more robust to
   changes in program structure, and 3.) more robust to the choice of
   variables monitored. We assess the efficacy and sensitivity to program
   structure of OMC/DC as compared to masking MC/ DC using four subsystems
   from the civil avionics domain and the control logic of a microwave. We
   have found that test suites satisfying OMC/DC are significantly more
   effective than test suites satisfying MC/ DC, revealing up to 88\% more
   faults, and are less sensitive to program structure and the choice of
   monitored variables.}},

   graph-theoretic algorithms that we have previously developed, to analyze
   the time scale properties of the network and obtain energy flow
   subgraphs for each time scale. Then, from each energy flow subgraph, we

Abstract = {{In this paper we present a solution to the problem of positioning a team
   of Micro Aerial Vehicles for a surveillance task in an environment of
   arbitrary and unknown morphology. The problem is addressed taking into
   account physical and environmental constraints like limited sensor
   capabilities and obstacle avoidance. The goal is to maximize the area
   monitored by the team, by identifying the best configuration of the team
   members. The proposed method is a distributed extension of our previous
   work based on the Cognitive Adaptive Optimization (CAO) algorithm. This
   distributed and scalable approach allows us to obtain coordinated and
   safe trajectories to accomplish the task in 3D environments. The
   different formulation of the problem considered in this paper allows
   also dealing with communication constraints. We provide extensive
   experimental results using data collected by a team of aerial robots and
   compare the efficiency of the distributed and centralized approach.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of real-time tracking has been studied widely and many
   methods in very different fields of application have been developed
   manipulating image based elements. While all use features as a way to
   represent a tracked object in the image, naturally, depending on the
   method and the objects, some features are better than others.
   As part of the project presented in {[}1], the goal of this paper is to
   provide efficient descriptors to perform real-time tracking of children.
   Covariance descriptors are a common and convenient way to describe an
   object, since they compile in a single matrix several features and also
   their statistical interrelationships. This paper introduces a Genetic
   Algorithm as a way to seek the best combination among a list of features
   for describing a selected object in a video sequence. The implemented
   Genetic Algorithm is a Niched Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA), and two
   different methods of selection/reproduction have been compared; a
   regular method and one based on a High Elitism process. Reliable results
   are obtained, since the features combined seem to match the tracked
   object characteristics, but dissimilarities between the two methods are
   also highlighted. In the end, this paper doesn't focus on the
   performances of the GAs themselves, but it proposes a Genetic Algorithm
   as a way of solving a dictionary learning problem.}},

Abstract = {{In a business setting, the customer value is crucial as it determines
   how much it is worth spending to acquire a particular customer. Viral
   marketing techniques leverages social ties among users to help
   advertising a particular product. Recently, as mobile devices (e.g.,
   smart phones, GPS devices) became ubiquitous, location-based social
   networking websites (e. g., Gowalla, BrightKite, Foursquare) are getting
   more and more popular. Along with location-based social networking
   services being prominent, new kind of data came into play besides the
   traditional social networking data: (1) Spatial data: represents the
   users geo-locations, venues geo-locations and information about users
   visiting different venues. (2) Users Opinions data: represents how much
   a user likes the venues she visits (e.g., Alice visited restaurant A and
   gave it a rating of five over five). In this paper, we present PLUTUS; a
   framework that assists venues (e.g., restaurant, gym, shopping mall)
   owners in growing their business. To recommend the best set of
   customers, PLUTUS takes three main aspects into consideration: (1)
   Social aspect, (2) Spatial aspect, and (3) Users opinions aspect. To
   this end, PLUTUS proposes two main algorithms: (1) Profit Calculation:
   It is responsible of calculating the total profit that a user u may add
   to a venue v taking into account the social, spatial, and user opinions
   aspects. (2) Profit Maximization: This algorithm is used to maximize the
   total profit of a given venue. We evaluated PLUTUS using real data set
   extracted from an existing Location-based Social Networking website,
   Foursquare. The results show that Plutus achieves higher estimated
   profit and more efficient profit calculation than naive marketing
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{A recently proposed method to reduce clock jitter effects in
   continuous-time Delta-Sigma modulators is to generate a return-to-zero
   feedback with a fixed-width pulse for active feedback. In practice, the
   pulse width is subject to noise effects causing jitter of the pulse
   width itself. Therefore, jitter of the pulse width, though not the
   clock, may still degrade the performance of Delta-Sigma modulators. In
   this brief, we investigate practical feasibility of the method. It is
   shown that jitter of the pulse width could be conditionally much smaller
   than that of the clock, which therefore reduces clock jitter effects.}},

   propose an efficient stochastic sum-rate maximization algorithm based on
   the iterative optimization of the ensemble average of the sum rate

   guaranteed to converge to the set of stationary points of the stochastic

Abstract = {{Both academic research and historical incidents have shown that unstable
   BGP speakers can have extreme, undesirable impacts on network
   performance and reliability. Large amounts of time and energy have been
   invested in improving router stability. In this paper, we show how an
   adversary in control of a BGP speaker in a transit AS can cause a victim
   router in an arbitrary location on the Internet to become unstable.
   Through experimentation with both hardware and software routers, we
   examine the behavior of routers under abnormal conditions and come to
   three conclusions. First, that unexpected but perfectly legal BGP
   messages can place routers into those states with troubling ease.
   Second, that an adversary can implement attacks using these messages to
   disrupt the function of victim routers in arbitrary locations in the
   network. And third, modern best practices do not blunt the force of
   these attacks sufficiently. These conclusions lead us to recommend more
   rigorous testing of BGP implementations, focusing as much on protocol
   correctness as on software correctness.}},

Title = {{Using a Smartphone Application to Support Visually Impaired Pedestrians
   at Signalized Intersection Crossings}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{12-20}},
Abstract = {{People with vision impairment rely heavily on walking and public transit
   for their transportation needs. A major challenge for this population is
   crossing intersections safely. As a result of the Americans with
   Disabilities Act, accessible pedestrian signal systems at signalized
   intersections have improved significantly since 2000. However, these
   systems still have shortcomings for both users and municipalities, and
   new approaches are needed to serve pedestrians with low vision
   adequately. As part of the ongoing effort to develop a prototype mobile
   accessible pedestrian signals (MAPS) application for the blind and
   visually impaired, 10 blind and low-vision people were interviewed to
   understand better what types of information they use at intersection
   crossings and to identify the types of information that could assist
   them. With these survey results, a MAPS system was developed to provide
   signal and intersection geometry information to smartphone users at
   signalized intersections. User interaction was with simple tactile input
   (single or double tap) and text-to-speech technology. A field experiment
   at two signalized intersections was conducted with 18 visually impaired
   participants to validate the use and functioning of the MAPS system in a
   real-world application. The purpose was to identify whether the
   smartphone application could effectively provide geometry and signal
   timing information and thus provide decision support for visually
   impaired pedestrians. Objective and subjective measures were developed
   to evaluate the performance of visually impaired users of MAPS.
   Participants reported that the MAPS system provided helpful geometry
   information (82\%) and helpful signal information (59\%).}},

   introduces the concept of a mobile electrical grid and discusses the

   to estimate the two-dimensional location coordinates of sensor nodes by
   processing multiple one-dimensional node sequences that can be easily
   obtained via loosely guided localization event distributions. The
   proposed design is evaluated through theoretical analysis, extensive
   simulations, and physical experiments (an indoor test-bed with 44 MICAz

Abstract = {{Energy harvesting is becoming an important enabling technology for
   sustainable sensor networks. However, the uncertainty and non-uniformity
   of harvestable energy and the unbalanced workload will often result in
   the node failures of solar-powered sensor networks. In order to decrease
   the energy depletion and improve the performance, we introduce an
   ultra-capacitor-based energy sharing system and design an energy sharing
   scheme based on it to optimize the network throughput. Different from
   most of the existing approaches which are focusing on energy management
   on single node, our design considers energy as a shared resource which
   makes it be used more efficiently, especially in the case with limited

   sharing system as well as the energy sharing schemes can effectively

Abstract = {{Given a raster spatial framework, as well as training and test sets, the
   spatial decision tree learning (SDTL) problem aims to minimize
   classification errors as well as salt-and-pepper noise. The SDTL problem
   is important due to many societal applications such as land cover
   classification in remote sensing. However, the SDTL problem is
   challenging due to the spatial autocorrelation of class labels, and the
   potentially exponential number of candidate trees. Related work is
   limited due to the use of local-test-based decision nodes, which can not
   adequately model spatial autocorrelation during test phase, leading to
   high salt-and-pepper noise. In contrast, we propose a focal-test-based
   spatial decision tree (FTSDT) model, where the tree traversal direction
   for a location is based on not only local but also focal (i.e.,
   neighborhood) properties of the location. Experimental results on real
   world remote sensing datasets show that the proposed approach reduces
   salt-and-pepper noise and improves classification accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are prevalent in all types of tumors.
   It is still a challenge to study how CNVs play a role in driving
   tumorgenic mechanisms that are either universal or specific in different
   cancer types. To address the problem, we introduce a transfer learning
   framework to discover common CNVs shared across different tumor types as
   well as CNVs specific to each tumor type from genome-wide CNV data
   measured by arrayCGH and SNP genotyping array. The proposed model,
   namely Transfer Learning with Fused LASSO (TLFL), detects latent CNV
   components from multiple CNV datasets of different tumor types to
   distinguish the CNVs that are common across the datasets and those that
   are specific in each dataset. Both the common and type-specific CNVs are
   detected as latent components in matrix factorization coupled with fused
   LASSO on adjacent CNV probe features. TLFL considers the common latent
   components underlying the multiple datasets to transfer knowledge across
   different tumor types. In simulations and experiments on real cancer CNV
   datasets, TLFL detected better latent components that can be used as
   features to improve classification of patient samples in each individual
   dataset compared with the model without the knowledge transfer. In
   cross-dataset analysis on bladder cancer and cross-domain analysis on
   breast cancer and ovarian cancer, TLFL also learned latent CNV
   components that are both predictive of tumor stages and correlate with
   known cancer genes.}},

   operation of transmission lines. Many articles have been published in
   literature which demonstrate how static series connected FACTS devices
   can solve numerous power system problems. However, they are not widely

   make it hard to justify their installation. The paper presents the
   various applications of series connected FACTS devices and the
   controllers used in literature. It also presents a comparison between
   fixed and static series compensation device. The paper also explores the
   economic challenges of installing series connected FACTS devices on the
   electric power system and some possible economic solutions. A cost
   effective solution to implement static phase shifting at the neutral of

Abstract = {{In this paper we explore the design space of creating a multi-threaded
   graph partitioner. We present and compare multiple approaches for
   parallelizing each of the three phases of multilevel graph partitioning:
   coarsening, initial partitioning, and uncoarsening. We also explore the
   differences in thread lifetimes and data ownership in this context. We
   show that despite the options for fine-grain synchronization and task
   decomposition offered by current threading technologies, the best
   performance is achieved by preserving data ownership and minimizing
   synchronization. In addition to this we also present an unprotected
   approach to generating a vertex matching in parallel with little
   overhead. We use these findings to develop an OpenMP based
   implementation(1) of the Metis algorithms and compare it against MPI
   based partitioners on three different multi-core architectures. Our
   multi-threaded implementation not only achieves greater than a factor of
   two speedup over the other partitioners, but also uses significantly
   less memory.}},

Abstract = {{Computer vision as an entire field has a wide and diverse range of

   proof-of-concept for a choreography assistance tool used to recognize
   and record dance movements demonstrated by a choreographer. Keeping the
   commercial arena in mind, the Kinect from Microsoft was chosen as the
   imaging hardware, and a pilot set chosen to verify recognition
   feasibility. Before implementing a classifier, all training and test
   data was transformed to a more applicable representation scheme to only
   pass the important aspects to the classifier to distinguish moves for
   the pilot set. In addition, several classification algorithms using the
   Nearest Neighbor (NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) methods were
   tested and compared from a single dictionary as well as on several
   different subjects. The results were promising given the framework of

Abstract = {{This paper presents hybrid Minimum Mean Squared Error-based estimators
   for wireless sensor networks with time-varying communication-bandwidth
   constraints, focusing on the particular application of multi-robot
   Cooperative Localization. When sensor nodes (e. g., robots) communicate
   only a quantized version of their analog measurements to the team, our
   proposed hybrid filters enable robots to process all available
   information, i.e., local analog measurements (recorded by its own
   sensors) as well as remote quantized measurements (collected and
   communicated by other sensors). Moreover, these filters are
   resource-aware and can utilize additional bandwidth, whenever available,
   to maximize estimation accuracy. Specifically, in this paper, we present
   two filters, the Hybrid Batch-Quantized Kalman filter (H-BQKF) and the
   Hybrid Iteratively-Quantized Kalman filter (H-IQKF), that can process
   local analog measurements along with remote measurements quantized to
   any number of bits. We test our proposed filters in simulations and

Abstract = {{Presented are results demonstrating that, in developing a system with
   its first objective being the sustained detection of adults and young
   children as they move and interact in a normal preschool setting, the
   direct application of the straightforward RGB-D innovations presented
   here significantly outperforms even far more algorithmically advanced
   methods relying solely on images. The use of multiple RGB-D sensors by
   this project for depth-aware object localization economically resolves
   numerous issues regularly frustrating earlier visiononly detection and
   human surveillance methods, issues such as occlusions, illumination
   changes, unexpected postures, atypical morphologies, erratic or
   unanticipated motions, reflections, and misleading textures and
   colorations.
   This multiple RGB-D installation forms the front-end for a multi-step
   pipeline, the first portion of which seeks to isolate, in situ, 3D
   renderings of classroom occupants sufficient for a later analysis of
   their behaviors and interactions. Towards this end, a voxel-based
   approach to foreground/background separation and an effective adaptation
   of supervoxel clustering for 3D were developed, and 3D and image-only
   methods were tested and compared. The project's setting is highly
   challenging, but then so are its longer term goals: the automated
   detection of early childhood precursors, ofttimes very subtle, to a
   number of increasingly common developmental disorders.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a linear-complexity 3D inertial navigation
   algorithm using both point and plane features observed from an RGBD
   camera. In particular, we study the system's observability properties,
   and prove that: (i) When observing a single plane feature of known
   direction, the IMU gyroscope bias is observable. (ii) By observing a
   single point feature, as well as a single plane of known direction but
   not perpendicular to gravity, all degrees of freedom of the IMU-RGBD
   navigation system become observable, up to global translations. Next,
   based on the results of the observability analysis, we design a
   consistency-improved, observability-constrained (OC) extended Kalman
   filter (EKF)-based estimator for the IMU-RGBD camera navigation system.
   Finally, we experimentally validate the superiority of our proposed
   algorithm compared to alternative methods in urban scenes.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of coordinating an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)
   and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for a precision agriculture
   application. In this application, the ground and aerial measurements are
   used for estimating nitrogen (N) levels on-demand across a farm. Our
   goal is to estimate the N map over a field and classify each point based
   on N deficiency levels. These estimates in turn guide fertilizer
   application. Applying the right amount of fertilizer at the right time
   can drastically reduce fertilizer usage.
   Towards building such a system, this paper makes the following
   contributions: First, we present a method to identify points whose
   probability of being misclassified is above a threshold. Second, we
   study the problem of maximizing the number of such points visited by an
   UAV subject to its energy budget. The novelty of our formulation is the
   capability of the UGV to mule the UAV to deployment points. This allows
   the system to conserve the short battery life of a typical UAV. Third,
   we introduce a new path planning problem in which the UGV must take a
   measurement within a disk centered at each point visited by the UAV. The
   goal is to minimize the total time spent in traveling and measuring. For
   both problems, we present constant-factor approximation algorithms.
   Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our system with simulations which
   use manually collected soil measurements from the field.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the problem of designing search strategies to
   find a target whose motion is described by a random walk along a
   one-dimensional bounded environment. The sensing model and the
   characteristic of the environment require the searcher and the target to
   be on the same site at the same time to guarantee capture. The objective
   is to optimize the searcher's motion, given by a sequence of actions
   (move right, left or remain stationary), so that the probability of
   capturing the target is maximized. Each action is associated with an
   energy cost. The searcher strategy is constrained by a total energy
   budget. We propose a class of randomized strategies for which we provide
   an analytical expression for the capture probability as a function of a
   single parameter. We then use this expression to find the best strategy
   within this class. In addition to theoretical results, the algorithms
   are analyzed in simulation and compared with other intuitive solutions.}},

Pages = {{121-127}},
Abstract = {{Rear-end crashes on freeways contribute significantly to nonrecurring
   congestion. Reducing these events would significantly improve freeway
   capacity, particularly during peak hours. Although promising
   countermeasures, such as variable speed limits, changeable message
   signs, and vehicle-based improvements, are under consideration,
   currently there is a shortage of demonstrably proven countermeasures
   targeted at freeway rear-end crashes. Liability rules, in which the
   direct cost associated with a crash is divided between the drivers,
   their insurance companies, or both, are a primary mechanism for
   influencing the occurrence of freeway rear-end crashes. An exploratory
   effort uses concepts from evolutionary game theory to predict the
   effects of liability rules on rear-end crashes. In a typical two-vehicle
   car-following scenario, driving behavior can be associated with a
   utility that each driver expects to achieve depending on his or her and
   the opponent's actions. Such interactions between leader and follower
   are modeled as the outcome of an evolutionary process in which drivers
   with different driving behaviors are randomly and repeatedly matched
   against each other to play a two-player game. The outcome of these games
   determines the fraction of drivers pursuing a particular driving
   strategy for the next phase of the game. The stable long-run
   distribution of driving strategies is then used to predict the
   proportion of drivers who are more likely to be involved in a rear-end
   accident. It turns out that when direct crash costs are allocated evenly
   to the involved drivers, a population in which all drivers act to avoid
   crashes is not evolutionarily stable.}},

Abstract = {{Local field potentials (LFPs) are thought to be promising feedback

   1000 mu m, while a larger inter-electrode spacing of 1.5-3 mm with one
   contact in the GPe and the other in the GPi produced the strongest
   activity. Finally, oscillatory activity recorded within the same region
   of globus pallidus with a bipolar electrode montage oriented
   longitudinally versus radially did not differ significantly. Together,
   these data provide important guidelines for the design of recording
   electrodes for use with closed-loop DBS leads in the globus pallidus.}},

   covering 7 brain regions and 5 frequency sub-bands are extracted as

   subjects read sentence stimuli silently. A two-stage feature selection
   algorithm combining F-score and Adaptive Boosting (Adaboost) model is
   proposed to rank the features. The top ranked features are used to build
   a boosted non-linear classifier using linear decision stumps as the base
   classifiers. A majority voting scheme is employed to combine single
   trial classification results from each test subject to make final
   classification decisions. Following a leave-one-out cross validation
   procedure, the proposed system achieves 82.61\% classification accuracy
   (92.31\% specificity and 70\% sensitivity) on 13 healthy controls and 10
   SZ patients. The most discriminating PSDR features are selected from the
   right temporal, right parietal and right frontal regions and are related
   to alpha (8-13Hz) and beta (13-30Hz) frequency ranges. This information

Abstract = {{The dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is thought to be an
   integrative brain area for intelligent behavior in primates. It is
   responsible for motor planning, decision making, and has been shown to
   be involved with working memory. We studied the role of the DLPFC in
   controlling a complex instructed behavior, in which a non-human primate
   produced sequential arm movements punctuated by sequences of self-timed
   temporal intervals. We examined local field potentials (LFPs) recorded
   during an instruction period before the movement onset and used a Neural
   Network Classifier to predict whether the subject would perform the
   upcoming behavior correctly. The classifier was able to predict the
   outcomes of movement using LFPs during 3 scenarios: spatial error versus
   correct trial, temporal error versus correct trial, and spatial versus
   temporal error. The successful classification of the outcomes indicates
   that DLPFC LFPs can be used as a signal for cognitive neural prosthetics
   (CNPs).}},

Abstract = {{Annotating documents with relevant and comprehensive keywords offers
   invaluable assistance to the readers to quickly overview any document.
   The problem of document annotation is addressed in the literature under
   two broad classes of techniques namely, key phrase extraction and key
   phrase abstraction. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to
   generate summary phrases for research documents. Given the dynamic
   nature of scientific research, it has become important to incorporate
   new and popular scientific terminologies in document annotations. For
   this purpose, we have used crowd-source knowledge bases like Wikipedia
   and WikiCFP (a open source information source for call for papers) for
   automating key phrase generation. Also, we have taken into account the
   lack of availability of the document's content (due to protective
   policies) and developed a global context based key-phrase identification
   approach. We show that given only the title of a document, the proposed
   approach generates its global context information using academic search
   engines like Google Scholar. We evaluated the performance of the
   proposed approach on real-world dataset obtained from a computer science
   research document corpus. We quantitatively evaluated the performance of
   the proposed approach and compared it with two baseline approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of user's interest to item matching is at the core of
   recommendation systems and search engines. This problem is well studied
   in different contexts such as item, document, music and movie
   recommendations. For the purpose of recommendation these systems store
   the context or the meta-data information about the item of interest
   (e.g. user rating for books, tags, price etc). However, the general
   approaches for finding relevant items for recommendation cannot be
   directly applied in the case when the context or meta-data information
   about the item of interest is missing. In this paper we describe an
   algorithmic approach to handle this problem of missing context for
   items. In the proposed approach we have extended the context of user's
   interest and developed an unsupervised algorithm to find the items of
   interest for the user. Finally the items are ranked based on their
   relevance to the user's interest. We study this problem in the domain of
   dataset recommendation where the meta-data information about the
   datasets is missing due to lack of coherent and complete repository for
   the research datasets. We evaluate the performance of the proposed
   framework with real world dataset consisting of 20 user queries. We find
   that the proposed framework can recommend datasets for user queries with
   a recall of 90\% in the top-4 recommendations. We also compared the
   performance of the dataset finding algorithm with the state of art
   supervised classification approach. We get a significant improvement of
   36\% using the proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Carpooling taxicab services hold the promise of providing additional
   transportation supply, especially in extreme weather or rush hour when
   regular taxicab services are insufficient. Although many recommendation
   systems about regular taxicab services have been proposed recently,
   little research, if any, has been done to assist passengers to find a
   successful taxicab ride with carpooling. In this paper, we present the
   first systematic work to design a unified recommendation system for both
   regular and carpooling services, called CallCab, based on a data driven
   approach. In response to a passenger's request, CallCab aims to
   recommend either (i) a vacant taxicab for a regular service with no
   detour, or (ii) an occupied taxicab heading to the similar direction for
   a carpooling service with less detour, yet without assuming any
   knowledge of destinations of passengers already on occupied taxicabs. To
   analyze these unknown destinations of occupied taxicabs, CallCab
   generates and refines taxicab trip distributions based on GPS datasets
   and context information collected in the existing taxicab
   infrastructure. To improve CallCab's efficiency to process such a big
   dataset, we augment the efficient MapReduce model with a Measure phase
   tailored for our application. We evaluate CallCab with a real world
   dataset of 14, 000 taxicabs, and results show that compared to ground
   truth, CallCab can reduce 64\% of the total mileage to deliver all

Abstract = {{The design and construction of a permanent magnet thrust bearing for a
   bearingless motor is presented and a measurement technique is proposed
   to characterize the bearing. Optimal design of a bearingless motor
   requires the machine designer to be aware of the axial bearing's
   performance under simultaneous axial and radial displacement. A simple,
   low-cost test setup which requires only two single-axis load cells is
   proposed and evaluated to make these measurements on the magnetic
   bearing stator. The measurement data are found to be in reasonable
   agreement with finite element calculations and to satisfy Earnshaw's
   theorem, where the sum of stiffnesses in the three axes must be zero.
   The measurement technique displayed good test-retest reliability, with
   repeated radial force data having an average standard deviation of 2.1\%
   for radial displacements greater than 0.5 mm and axial force data having
   a typical error of 0.9\%.}},

   Specifically, this paper considers a dual-redundant fault tolerant

   using the law of total probability. The analysis assumes known failure

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to detect the use of automated programs,
   known as game bots, based on social interactions in MMORPGs. Online
   games, especially MMORPGs, have become extremely popular among internet
   users in the recent years. Not only the popularity but also security
   threats such as the use of game bots and identity theft have grown
   manifold. As bot players can obtain unjustified assets without
   corresponding efforts, the gaming community does not allow players to
   use game bots. However, the task of identifying game bots is not an easy
   one because of the velocity and variety of their evolution in mimicking
   human behavior. Existing methods for detecting game bots have a few
   drawbacks like reducing immersion of players, low detection accuracy
   rate, and collision with other security programs. We propose a novel
   method for detecting game bots based on the fact that humans and game
   bots tend to form their social network in contrasting ways. In this work
   we focus particularly on the in game mentoring network from amongst
   several social networks. We construct a couple of new features based on
   eigenvector centrality to capture this intuition and establish their
   importance for detecting game bots. The results show a significant
   increase in the classification accuracy of various classifiers with the
   introduction of these features.}},

   the stresses and the strains induced in the active region by the

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology for implementing digital logic with
   molecular reactions based on a bistable mechanism for representing bits.
   The value of a bit is not determined by the concentration of a single
   molecular type; rather, it is the comparison of the concentrations of
   two complementary types that determines if the bit is ``0{''} or
   ``1{''}. This mechanism is robust: any small perturbation or leakage in
   the concentrations quickly gets cleared out and the signal value is not
   affected. Based on this representation for bits, a constituent set of
   logical components are implemented. These include combinational
   components AND, OR, NOR, and XOR - as well as sequential components - D
   latches and D flip-flops. Using these components, three full-fledged
   design examples are given: a square-root unit, a binary adder and a
   linear feedback shift register. DNA-based computation via strand
   displacement is the target experimental chassis. The designs are
   validated through simulations of the chemical kinetics. The simulations
   show that the molecular systems compute digital functions accurately and
   robustly.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing is an alternative approach to conventional real
   arithmetic. A stochastic computing module is a digital system that
   operates on random bit streams representing real numbers. The success of
   stochastic computing relies on the efficient generation of random bit
   streams encoding real values in the unit interval. We present the design
   of random bit stream generators based on finite state machines (FSMs)
   that emulate Reversible Markov chains. We develop a general synthesis
   method to designs FSMs for generating arbitrary probabilities with
   finite resolution. We show that our method uses fewer input random
   sources for the constant random bit streams needed in a computation
   compared to the previous work. We further show that the output random
   bit stream quality and convergence times of our FSMs are reasonable.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to regulate and even target mutagenesis is an extremely
   valuable cellular asset. Enzyme-catalyzed DNA cytosine deamination is a
   molecular strategy employed by vertebrates to promote antibody diversity
   and defend against foreign nucleic acids. Ten years ago, a family of
   cellular enzymes was first described with several proving capable of
   deaminating DNA and inhibiting HIV-1 replication. Ensuing studies on the
   apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3
   (APOBEC3) restriction factors have uncovered a broad-spectrum innate
   defense network that suppresses the replication of numerous endogenous
   and exogenous DNA-based parasites. Although many viruses possess equally
   elaborate counter-defense mechanisms, the APOBEC3 enzymes offer a
   tantalizing possibility of leveraging innate immunity to fend off viral
   infection. Here, we focus on mechanisms of retroelement restriction by
   the APOBEC3 family of restriction enzymes, and we consider the
   therapeutic benefits, as well as the possible pathological consequences,
   of arming cells with active DNA deaminases.}},

Abstract = {{A novel inverter-based-integrator filter design is proposed that relaxes
   the UGB requirement of the OTAs by decoupling the integration
   capacitance from the feedback loop. The proposed scheme allows the
   entire filtering operation to take place in the current domain reducing
   power supply limitations. Further, in the design the load acts as the
   compensation capacitance to the OTAs allowing the majority of the
   current to flow into the load, increasing the overall power efficiency.
   As a proof of concept, a 3rd order lowpass filter is designed and
   implemented in an IBM 65nm CMOS process. The measured prototype designed
   for a 50MHz bandwidth achieves an IIP3 of +33dBm and 1.8X better FOM
   over state-of-art while drawing 1.3mA from a 1.2V supply, is capable of
   driving a 1pF load, and occupies 6X smaller area.}},

Abstract = {{Soil erosion by the environmental agents of water and wind is a
   continuing global menace that threatens the agricultural base that
   sustains our civilization. For over 70 years, ASABE members have been at
   the forefront of research to understand erosion processes, measure
   erosion and related processes, and model very complex sediment
   detachment, transport, and deposition. The ASABE Erosion Control Group
   (SW-22) and Erosion Control Research (SW-223) committees periodically
   sponsor international symposia to provide an avenue for exchange of
   ideas and information by engineers, scientists, and students from around
   the world. The two most recent symposia were the Soil Erosion Research
   for the 21st Century Symposium held in January 2001 in Honolulu, Hawaii,
   and the International Symposium on Erosion and Landscape Evolution
   (ISELE) held in September 2011 in Anchorage, Alaska. This article
   describes these two events, provides a description of major outcomes,
   and introduces a collection of papers that were presented as part of the
   2011 ISELE in Alaska. The ISELE sessions focused on seven themes: water
   erosion process research; aeolian erosion and fugitive dust emission;
   highly disturbed, urban, and arid lands; erosion measurement and
   assessment; prevention and control of upland and in-stream erosion; soil
   erosion modeling; and impacts of global change on erosion and landscape
   evolution. More than 120 people from 16 countries attended the ISELE and
   gave 112 oral and poster presentations. From those presentations, 24
   papers were accepted for publication in Transactions of the ASABE (22
   papers, this issue) and Applied Engineering in Agriculture (two papers,
   next issue). The results from these symposia and in these papers show
   active and vibrant research to address soil erosion problems,
   particularly in the face of global environmental changes.}},

Journal = {{TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE}},

Volume = {{56}},

Pages = {{465-478}},
Abstract = {{Many field observations have led to speculation on the role of piping in
   embankment failures, landslides, and gully erosion. However, there has
   not been a consensus on the subsurface flow and erosion processes
   involved, and inconsistent use of terms have exacerbated the problem.
   One such piping process that has been the focus in numerous field
   observations, but with very limited mechanistic experimental work, is
   flow through a discrete macropore or soil pipe. Questions exist as to
   the conditions under which preferential flow through soil pipes results
   in internal erosion, stabilizes hillslopes by acting as drains,
   destabilizes hillslopes via pore-pressure buildups, and results in gully
   formation or reformation of filled-in ephemeral gullies. The objectives
   of this article are to review discrepancies in terminology in order to
   represent the piping processes better, to highlight past experimental
   work on the specific processes of soil pipeflow and internal erosion,
   and to assess the state-of-the-art modeling of pipeflow and internal
   erosion. The studies reviewed include those that examined the process of
   slope stability as affected by the clogging of soil pipes, the process
   of gullies forming due to mass failures caused by flow into
   discontinuous soil pipes, and the process of gully initiation by tunnel
   collapse due to pipes enlarging by internal erosion. In some of these
   studies, the soil pipes were simulated with perforated tubes placed in
   the soil, while in others the soil pipes were formed from the soil
   itself. Analytical solutions of the excess shear stress equation have
   been applied to experimental data of internal erosion of soil pipes to
   calculate critical shear stress and erodibility properties of soils. The
   most common numerical models for pipeflow have been based on Richards'
   equation, with the soil pipe treated as a highly conductive porous
   medium instead of a void. Incorporating internal erosion into such
   models has proven complicated due to enlargement of the pipe with time,
   turbulent flow, and episodic clogging of soil pipes. These studies and
   modeling approaches are described, and gaps in our understanding of
   pipeflow and internal erosion processes and our ability to model these
   processes are identified, along with recommendations for future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The Minnesota River carries the largest load of sediment to the
   Mississippi River in Minnesota, most of which comes from channel
   sources. This study investigates bank retreat in the lower Minnesota
   River since 1938. Specifically we asked, How have changes to river form
   influenced sediment transport and deposition in the lower Minnesota
   River and how did hydrological and ecological processes affect channel
   change? It was hypothesized that channel straightening, reduction in
   floodplain access, and streamflow increases contribute to increased
   channel-derived sediment load and decreased point bar deposition.
   Secondly, it was hypothesized that hydrologic changes have reduced woody
   riparian vegetation on sandbars, further promoting channel widening. To
   quantify channel sediment and phosphorus loading rates in the lower
   Minnesota River, we analyzed historic aerial photos for evidence of
   channel change, we performed long-term monitoring of erosion and
   deposition rates within the river corridor, and we calculated channel
   sediment transport rates. Results from this study showed that the
   Minnesota River has widened by 52\% between Mankato and St. Paul since
   1938, on average contributing 280,000 Mg of sediment per year and 153 Mg
   total phosphorus. The river also shortened by 7\% since 1938, increasing
   bankfull shear stress and stream power. Sediment deposition rates in the
   floodplain have increased since European settlement by an order of
   magnitude. Ecohydrological studies showed that establishment of woody
   riparian plants has been inhibited on sandbars by prolonged summer flow
   duration and scour at high flow, reducing potential point bar growth.
   Findings from this study will be useful in prioritizing sediment and
   vegetation management actions.}},

Abstract = {{Modern Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) are capable of supporting
   thousands of concurrent threads. However, they provide relatively little
   guarantee with respect to the coherence and consistency of the memory
   system. Thus, GPUs are prone to multitude of concurrency bugs related to
   inconsistent memory states. Many such bugs manifest as some form of data
   races at runtime, and being able to identify these data races can help
   programmers improve software reliability, Mechanisms that enable
   efficient and effective data race detection at runtime can form the
   basis of powerful tools for enhancing GPU software correctness. Most
   prior works in data race detection for GPU focus on the software-based
   approaches that incur significant performance overhead. Furthermore,
   they often focus on the smaller shared memory, while neglecting the
   larger global memory. We believe that adequate hardware support can
   enable efficient data race detection in all levels of the memory system
   for GPUs.
   In this paper, we propose a hardware-accelerated data race detection
   mechanism, HAccRG, for efficient data race detection in GPUs. HAccRG
   Provides hardware support for tracking data dependencies across a large
   number of threads and detects various forms of data races. We
   incorporate HAccRG on both the shared and global memory spaces in GPU.
   Our evaluation shows that, with moderate hardware support, HAccRG can
   detect data races in GPU kernels with a small overhead: 1\% for the
   shared memory and 27\% for combined shared and global memory data race
   detection,}},

Abstract = {{Loudness restoration approaches to hearing aid fitting prescribe gain
   and compression so as to restore the loudness perceived by a
   hearing-impaired listener to that perceived by a listener with

   complicated by the spread of excitation at high stimulus levels that
   causes intense stimuli at low frequencies to be ``heard{''} and to
   contribute to the perceived loudness at high frequencies, producing
   excess loudness growth and poor sound quality. We apply derivative-free
   optimization algorithms to find a configuration of hearing aid gain and
   compression parameters that restores specific loudness perception of a
   hearing impaired listener to that of a normal hearing listener, while
   simultaneously minimizing the across-frequency spreading of excitation,

Abstract = {{Microbubble ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs) have been extensively used
   in medical ultrasound for enhancing the echo components from blood
   vessels. However, their ultimate promise of enhancing the echoes from
   the microvasculature with high specificity remains unfulfilled using
   existing methods. We have previously shown that the Volterra filter can
   be used to enhance UCA echo components from flow channels with
   dimensions similar to peripheral vessels, e.g. the carotid artery. In
   this paper, we investigate a new receiver architecture based on an
   adaptive third-order Volterra Filter (VF) in conjunction with beamformed
   echo data from imaging tumor microvasculature in vivo. It is shown that
   the cubic and quadratic components of the VF provide significant
   enhancement of the UCA echoes from the tumor compared to the echoes from
   the same tissue regions in the absence of the UCA. We describe an
   adaptive recursive least squares (RLS) implementation of the VF and give
   examples of the contrast enhancement. Further enhancement of the UCA
   contrast is achieved by applying a dynamic statistical decision rule
   that produces a parameter we refer to as the temporal perfusion index
   (TPI). The TPI rewards transient echo oscillations while rejecting
   tissue motion and noise variation. These in vivo results demonstrate the
   potential for advanced signal processing in increasing the sensitivity
   and specificity of medical ultrasound in imaging tissue perfusion, a
   form of functional imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes have emerged as important channel codes because of their
   capacity-achieving property. For low-complexity polar decoding, hardware
   architectures for successive cancellation (SC) algorithm have been
   investigated in prior works. However, belief propagation (BP)-based
   architectures have not been explored in detail. This paper begins with a
   review of min-sum (MS) approximated BP algorithm, and then proposes a
   scaled MS (SMS) algorithm with improved decoding performance. Then, in
   order to solve long critical path problem in the SMS algorithm, we
   propose an efficient critical path reduction approach. Due to its
   generality, this optimization method can be applied to both of SMS and
   MS algorithms. Compared with the state-of-the-art MS decoder, the
   proposed (1024, 512) SMS design can lead to 0.5dB extra decoding gain
   with the same hardware performance. Besides, the proposed optimized MS
   architecture can also achieve more than 30\% and 80\% increase in
   throughput and hardware efficiency, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing has recently gained attention due to its
   fault-tolerance property. In stochastic computing, numbers are
   represented by probabilities of sequences. This paper addresses
   implementation of inner products and digital filters using stochastic
   logic. Straightforward implementations of stochastic inner products and
   digital filters lead to significantly large output error. To overcome
   this, this paper proposes a novel scaling method for efficient
   stochastic logic implementations of inner products and digital filters.
   By incorporating the filter coefficients into the probability of the
   selection signals of the multiplexors, the proposed weighted summation
   circuit can achieve better signal scaling with lower cost than the one
   derived from a traditional structure. This paper also presents how to
   vary the seeds in stochastic filters in order to reduce the correlation.
   Implementing IIR filters using stochastic logic limits possible pole
   locations. To overcome this, a new stochastic IIR filter structure is
   presented that includes a binary multiplier and stochastic-to-binary and
   binary-to-stochastic converters. Our experimental results show that the
   proposed architecture for the inner-product unit can lead to more than
   12 times reduction in the error-to-power ratio. The stochastic FIR
   filters can perform the desired filtering function, but their accuracy
   degrades with the increase of filter order. The direct-form stochastic
   IIR filters may fail for large filter orders, but their performance can
   be improved by using cascade-form filter architecture.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers transmit covariance optimization for a multiinput
   multi-output (MIMO) Gaussian wiretap channel. Specifically, we aim to
   maximize the M1MO secrecy capacity by judiciously designing the transmit
   covariance under the sum power and per-antenna power constraints, The
   MIMO secrecy capacity maximization (SCM) problem is nonconve,x, and so
   far there is no tractable solution available. We propose an alternating
   optimization (AO) approach to handle the SCM problem. In particular, our
   development consists of two steps: First, we show that the SCM problem
   can be reexpressed to a form that can be conveniently processed by AO.
   Second, we develop a custom-designed fast algorithm for each AO
   iteration, Interestingly, with this fast implementation, the overall AO
   algorithm can be viewed as performing iterative reweighting and
   water-tilling. Finally, the convergence of the proposed algorithm to a
   stationary solution of SCM is shown, and numerical results are provided
   to demonstrate its efficacy.}},

Abstract = {{In a densely deployed Heterogeneous network (Het Net), the number of
   pico/micro base stations (BS) can be comparable or more than the number
   of the users. To reduce the operational overhead of the HetNet,
   selection of serving BSs becomes an important design issue. In this
   work, we propose to jointly optimize the transceiver and active BSs to
   trade off the overall spectrum efficiency with the operational overhead.
   We formulate this problem as a regularized sum rate maximization problem
   and solve it using sparse optimization techniques. The proposed
   algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a local optimal solution. The
   efficiency and the efficacy of the algorithm are demonstrated via
   realistic numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Wideband spectrum sensing is an important prerequisite for cognitive
   radio access. A network sensing scenario comprising low-end sensors is
   considered, with each sensor reporting a single randomly filtered power
   measurement bit to the fusion center (FC), which estimates the ambient
   power spectrum from these bits. An adaptive thresholding algorithm is
   proposed to improve the quality and speed of power spectrum
   reconstruction. Upon receipt of each new bit, the FC picks the threshold
   for the next sensor so as to cut off a half-space from the feasible
   region along its Chebyshev center. Convergence of this algorithm to the
   true finite-length autocorrelation is shown, whose Fourier transform
   yields the power spectrum estimate. To avoid the `downlink' threshold
   communication overhead, an alternative algorithm is proposed, where each
   sensor pseudo-randomly chooses its threshold from a suitable
   distribution, and the FC judiciously polls sensors to form its power
   spectrum estimate.}},

Abstract = {{A network comprised of high-density femtocells coexisting with

   (1) spectrum sharing where macrocells and femtocells can access the same
   subchannels, and (2) spectrum splitting where macrocells and femtocells
   access separate portions of the spectrum. In both approaches, the
   trade-off between the utilized bandwidth and the signal-to-interference
   ratio (SIR), as femtocells or macrocells access more subchannels, is
   studied. The number of utilized subchannels that maximizes the average
   spectral efficiency for femtocells, subject to a minimum average
   spectral efficiency constraint for macrocells, is analyzed for both
   approaches, showing that the performance with spectrum splitting is
   better than spectrum sharing, for the considered model.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an efficient maximum a posteriori (MAP)
   estimation algorithm, which effectively tracks multiple most probable
   hypotheses. In particular, due to multimodal distributions arising in
   most nonlinear problems, we employ a bank of MAP to track these modes
   (hypotheses). The key idea is that we analytically determine all the
   posterior modes for the current state at each time step, which are used
   to generate highly probable hypotheses for the entire trajectory.
   Moreover, since it is expensive to solve the MAP problem sequentially
   over time by an iterative method such as Gauss-Newton, in order to speed
   up its solution, we reuse the previous computations and incrementally
   update the square-root information matrix at every time step, while
   batch relinearization is performed only periodically or as needed.}},

   overexpressing cells. Branched-polyethyleneimine (bPEI) condensed
   plasmid DNA was encapsulated into targeted stealth liposomes, thereby
   combining the condensing and transfection properties of bPEI with the
   stealth and targeting properties of the liposomal carrier system. PR\_b
   was used as a targeting ligand - a peptide we designed to bind
   specifically to the cancer cell surface marker alpha(5)beta(1) integrin
   - and such a robust receptor-ligand interaction achieved higher
   specificity than what has been previously reported for targeted delivery
   systems. In the process of formulating the PR\_b functionalized gene
   delivery vehicle, we developed a protocol to fully encapsulate condensed
   DNA in liposomes and accurately quantify the total DNA in the system. We
   demonstrate that compared to non-targeted stealth liposomes and
   non-encapsulated condensed DNA, the PR\_b functionalized stealth
   liposomes mediated improved in vitro transfection specifically to colon
   cancer cells overexpressing the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. Furthermore,
   when administered in vivo to metastatic tumor bearing mice, PR\_b
   functionalized stealth liposomes outperformed non-targeted liposomes and
   delivered genes specifically to the tumor site.}},

Title = {{Population and size distribution of solute-rich mesospecies within
   mesostructured aqueous amino acid solutions}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{167}},
Pages = {{425-440}},
Abstract = {{Aqueous solutions of highly soluble substances such as small amino acids
   are usually assumed to be essentially homogenous systems with some
   degree of short range local structuring due to specific interactions on
   the sub-nanometre scale (e. g. molecular clusters, hydration shells),
   usually not exceeding several solute molecules. However, recent
   theoretical and experimental studies have indicated the presence of much
   larger supramolecular assemblies or mesospecies in solutions of small
   organic and inorganic molecules as well as proteins. We investigated
   both supersaturated and undersaturated aqueous solutions of two simple
   amino acids (glycine and DL-alanine) using Dynamic Light Scattering
   (DLS), Brownian Microscopy/Nanoparticles Tracking Analysis (NTA) and
   Cryogenic Transmission Electron Microscopy (Cryo-TEM). Colloidal scale
   mesospecies (nanodroplets) were previously reported in supersaturated
   solutions of these amino acids and were implicated as intermediate
   species on non-classical crystallization pathways. Surprisingly, we have
   found that the mesospecies are also present in significant numbers in
   undersaturated solutions even when the solute concentration is well
   below the solid-liquid equilibrium concentration (saturation limit).
   Thus, mesopecies can be observed with mean diameters ranging from 100 to
   300 nm and a size distribution that broadens towards larger size with
   increasing solute concentration. We note that the mesospecies are not a
   separate phase and the system is better described as a thermodynamically
   stable mesostructured liquid containing solute-rich domains dispersed
   within bulk solute solution. At a given temperature, solute molecules in
   such a mesostructured liquid phase are subject to equilibrium
   distribution between solute-rich mesospecies and the surrounding bulk
   solution.}},

Abstract = {{A generalization of the quasi-continuum (QC) method to finite
   temperature is presented. The resulting ``hot-QC{''} formulation is a
   partitioned domain multiscale method in which atomistic regions modeled
   via molecular dynamics coexist with surrounding continuum regions.
   Hot-QC can be used to study equilibrium properties of systems under
   constant or quasistatic loading conditions. Two variants of the method
   are presented which differ in how continuum regions are evolved. In
   ``hot-QC-static{''} the free energy of the continuum is minimized at
   each step as the atomistic region evolves dynamically. In
   ``hot-QC-dynamic{''} both the atomistic and continuum regions evolve
   dynamically in tandem. The latter approach is computationally more
   efficient, but introduces an anomalous ``mesh entropy{''} which must be
   corrected. Following a brief review of related finite-temperature
   methods, this review article provides the theoretical background for
   hot-QC (including new results), discusses the implementational details,
   and demonstrates the utility of the method via example test cases
   including nanoindentation at finite temperature.}},

Abstract = {{This paper is a perspective on the applicability of atomic layer
   deposition (ALD) to the synthesis of photovoltaic absorber layers. ALD
   offers digital control over composition with excellent uniformity and
   conformal morphology. Two types of thin film photovoltaic (PV) device
   architectures where ALD is viable to deposit the absorber layer are
   extremely thin absorber (ETA) cells and plasmon-enhanced cells. Metal
   sulfides are an attractive class of compounds for the absorber material.
   Successful absorber layers are engineered materials, optimized to meet
   the application specifications of performance and stability. Historical
   precedence in engineered materials contains many prominent
   multicomponent examples. Fortunately, atomic mixing is facile in
   multicomponent metal sulfide thin films synthesized by ALD, and so the
   synthetic approach is up to the task. Cu2ZnSnS4 is used as an example.}},

Title = {{Quantitative and time-resolved nanoparticle composition measurements
   during new particle formation}},
Journal = {{FARADAY DISCUSSIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{165}},
Pages = {{25-43}},
Abstract = {{The chemical composition of 20 nm diameter particles was measured with
   the Nano Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (NAMS) in a rural/coastal environment
   during days when new particle formation (NPF) occurred and days when NPF
   did not occur. NAMS provides a quantitative measure of nanoparticle
   elemental composition with high time resolution. These measurements show
   that nanoparticle chemical composition is dynamic on both types of days
   and that changes in nanoparticle chemical composition do not necessarily
   correlate with changes in aerosol mass or number concentration. On NPF
   days, NAMS can distinguish between elements associated with particle
   formation and early mass growth from those associated with later mass
   growth. In the early stage of NPF, the particle phase sulphur mole
   fraction (S) increases simultaneously with the increase in gas phase
   sulphuric acid. This composition change occurs before the mode diameter
   has grown into the NAMS-measured size range and is quantitatively
   described by sulphuric acid condensation. The nitrogen mole fraction (N)
   also increases during this time period. The N/S mole ratio is
   approximately 2, indicating that particulate sulphate is fully
   neutralized. As the mode diameter passes into and through the
   NAMS-measured size range, N increases at a faster rate than S (N/S mole
   ratio increases above 2), indicating that a separate, nitrogen-based
   growth process exists, possibly involving aminium salts, inorganic
   nitrate and/or organonitrates. Carbonaceous matter is the most abundant
   component (similar to 50\% by mass) of the growing nanoparticles, but it
   is the inorganic species that are preferentially enhanced during NPF
   relative to other times of day. Concurrent measurements of cloud
   condensation nucleation activity during NPF events suggest that these
   newly formed particles are hygroscopic. Nanoparticle composition on
   non-NPF days also shifts toward a more inorganic composition during the
   daytime, but the chemical species are different from NPF days and the
   particles are less hygroscopic. Incorporation of S into growing
   nanoparticles is adequately explained by existing models, but currently
   no models exist to satisfactorily explain incorporation of
   nitrogen-containing species or carbonaceous matter.}},

Title = {{Moisture Damage Evaluation of Asphalt Mixes That Contain Mining
   Byproducts}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2371}},
Pages = {{113-120}},
Abstract = {{The availability of mineral aggregates for pavement construction is
   continuously depleting. The aggregate manufacturing process requires
   significant amounts of energy, which ranges from 10 to 30 MJ/ton. The
   process also produces 5 kg/ton of carbon dioxide (CO2), which causes
   significant amounts of greenhouse gas emissions. With the annual
   consumption of approximately 1.2 billion tons of aggregates in the
   United States, the environmental impact is significant. More than 125
   million tons of fine-grained, crushed siliceous material is generated
   annually through iron ore mining in northern Minnesota. Typically, this
   material is referred to as ``taconite tailings{''} and usually ends up
   as landfill near mining operations. This paper describes a moisture
   damage evaluation of asphalt mixes that contained significant fractions
   of aggregate as taconite tailings. The evaluation was conducted with the
   use of the conventional AASHTO T 283 test procedure as well as an
   approach with a fracture energy basis. The paper presents comparative
   results for two mixes: one made with taconite tailings and the other
   with conventional granite aggregates. The results indicated that a mix
   that contained taconite had acceptable moisture-damage resistance. The
   results also pointed out the limitations of the AASHTO T 283 procedure,
   especially the process of moisture conditioning. The fracture energy
   results indicated that, although mixes underwent reduced tensile
   strength, the overall capability of mix to strain without cracking
   significantly increased after the AASHTO-recommended moisture
   conditioning process. The study also included a set of samples that were
   field-conditioned over the winter and spring months. The mechanical
   behavior of field-conditioned samples was quite different from the
   behavior of samples conditioned in the laboratory with the AASHTO
   procedure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports an experimental investigation of 3-N,
   N-dimethylaminodithiocarbamoyl-1-propane sulfonic acid (DPS) additive
   behavior attached to copper as a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) prior to
   electrodeposition of copper. Rotating disk electrode (RDE) voltammetry
   and linear sweep cyclic voltammetry (LSCV) revealed that the extent of
   derivatization of a Cu electrode is time-dependent and it can be
   controlled. The monitoring of copper deposition rate for 25 min on
   DPS-SAM derivatized electrode in PEG and DPS free electrolyte plating
   solution indicates that DPS-SAM remains attached at the electrode
   surface. It was demonstrated that the deactivation of DPS-SAM on Cu RDE
   during Cu deposition in acidic copper electrolyte (Cu+2 + PEG + Cl-)
   without DPS is dependent the on potential and rotation rate of the RDE.
   The superfilling of trenches with different width (0.5 mu m and 50 mu m)
   was demonstrated using a two-step process including DPS-derivatization
   of Cu seed layer on 6 inch patterned wafers, followed by copper
   electrodeposition. (C) 2013 The Electrochemical Society. All rights

Pages = {{201-210}},
Abstract = {{The paper investigates a novel approach to the traffic control problem
   of signalized junction with bus priority. In road traffic engineering
   practice, adaptive control algorithms are generally used for maximizing
   the traffic flow of intersections. The adaptive strategies aim to
   calculate optimal signal splits for the traffic lights. The calculation
   is usually based on the number of vehicles measured by appropriate
   detection methods and may also depend on public transport priority
   actions (e.g. ``green call{''} by buses). The main drawback of these
   methods is that the number of vehicle passengers is not taken into
   consideration. Unlike the common approaches the presented control
   strategy considers weighted passenger number exclusively (by using the
   assumption that the number of passengers can be measured in all
   vehicles). Hence, the control aim is to maximize the number of weighted
   passenger number capable to cross the intersection. The proposed control
   method is based on two factors: the number of passengers in road
   vehicles and their temporal distance measured from the stop line. The
   strategy does not apply priority measures for public transport directly.
   At the same time, the vehicles carrying numerous passengers (i.e. buses)
   acquire preference.}},

   rates were 0, 1.4, 2.1, and 2.8 t/ha for each crop, respectively. Soil
   Olsen-P in the plow layer increased to a greater extent with PM than
   with superphosphate. Pig manure increased neutral phosphatase activities
   in the plow layer compared with PM-free treatment. In contrast,
   superphosphate inhibited neutral phosphatase activities compared with
   superphosphate-free treatment. Spring application of P fertilizer
   markedly increased the total P of surface water in November (< 0.01 vs.
   0.10 mg/L) compared with P-free treatment. The total P of shallow
   groundwater at a 75 cm depth was similar to 0.01 mg/L. Phosphorus
   fertilizer did not influence Olsen-P or neutral phosphatase activities

Abstract = {{Stochastic encoding represents a value using the probability of ones in
   a random bit stream. Computation based on this encoding has good
   fault-tolerance and low hardware cost. However, one of its major issues
   is long processing time. We have to use a long enough bit stream to
   represent a value to guarantee that random fluctuations introduce only
   small errors to final computation results. For example, for most digital
   image processing algorithms, we need a 512-bit stream to represent an
   8-bit pixel value stochastically to guarantee that the final computation
   error is less than 5\%. To solve this issue, this paper proposes to
   share bits between adjacent bit streams to represent adjacent
   deterministic values. For example, in image processing applications, the
   bit stream which represents the current pixel value can share parts of
   the bits in the bit stream which represents the previous pixel value. We
   use an image contrast stretching algorithm to evaluate this method. Our
   experimental results show that the proposed methods can improve the
   performance by 90\%.}},

Abstract = {{Results of a blind test evaluation of various nondestructive testing
   techniques, including well-established methods such as chain dragging,
   rod sounding, and ground-penetrating radar, compared with an emerging
   ultrasonic array technology for determining the extent of concrete joint
   deterioration, are presented. Nondestructive testing at two concrete
   pavement joints at the Minnesota Road Research Facility was performed,
   and the results were independently evaluated and submitted to the
   Minnesota Department of Transportation. Significant discrepancies in
   subsurface deterioration assessments were observed between these
   techniques. Forensic evaluation (trenching and coring) was used to
   resolve the discrepancies in test results. It was concluded that the
   ultrasound array analysis was the only method that could accurately
   determine the horizontal extent of the deterioration otherwise
   undetected by the other available nondestructive evaluation methods.
   Additionally, ultrasonic tomography analysis was able to determine the
   depth of the deterioration. These results make this emerging technology
   an attractive alternative to traditional nondestructive testing methods
   for assessment of concrete pavement joints.}},

Abstract = {{Intersection safety is a national priority, and a driver's stop-or-run
   decision at signalized intersections is an important factor that can
   lead to red light running (RLR) and cause intersection-related
   accidents. This paper investigated this important issue by using
   high-resolution traffic and signal event data collected from loop
   detectors. First, a simple method was developed to identify
   first-to-stop, yellow light running, and RLR cases by using information
   from stop bar detectors located right behind the stop line and advance
   detectors located several hundred feet upstream from the stop line.
   Traffic data collected from advance detectors (including occupancy time
   and time gap), signal information collected from the signal system
   (including used yellow time and time left to yellow start), information
   from three preceding vehicles, and information from vehicles on adjacent
   lanes were all applied to identify the factors that significantly affect
   drivers' decision making. A binary logistical regression method was
   applied to analyze the significance of all these factors. From the
   investigation results, it was found that occupancy time, time gap, used
   yellow time, time left to yellow start, time gap between first two
   preceding vehicles, whether the nearest preceding vehicle runs through
   the intersection during yellow, and whether there is a vehicle passing
   through the intersection on the adjacent lane showed a significant
   effect on drivers' decisions. A prediction model, which predicted
   whether a driver stopped or ran through the intersection, was also
   developed with the information collected by advance detectors. The
   testing experiment showed that the model's accuracy was as high as 87\%.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{109-116}},
Abstract = {{Efficient operation of traffic signals is greatly beneficial to drivers.
   Because of the intensive labor required, most traffic signals in the
   United States are retimed once every 3 to 5 years or more, even though
   signal retiming has a very high benefit-cost ratio. Such a practice may
   miss opportunities for operational improvements and lead to unnecessary
   delays. One of the major obstacles to improving the practice is the lack
   of data collection capability and a convenient performance monitoring
   tool for signalized arterials. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a
   performance diagnosis tool for arterial traffic signal systems. The tool
   aims at identifying necessary parameter changes and assisting agencies
   in periodically fine-tuning signal timing parameters. A flexible and
   low-cost data collection unit is developed to equip traffic signal
   cabinets with event-based data collection capability. Three major
   parameters of traffic signals (offset, green split, and cycle length)
   are evaluated in the data center by diagnosis modules that use
   event-based traffic data. The development of the data collection unit
   and the diagnosis methodologies are described in detail. The
   implementation of the tool is illustrated by field data analysis at
   intersections on Trunk Highway 13 in Burnsville, Minnesota.}},

Abstract = {{The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) was a community-led, people-centred,
   demand-driven and incentive-based programme ideal to address India's
   rural sanitation crisis, or so it seemed. But policy failed to translate
   into practice and outcomes were remarkably poor. In the 2011 census data
   showed 31\% sanitation coverage in 2011 (up from 22\% in 2001), far from
   the 68\% reported by the Government. The decade has witnessed progress
   slowing down and the number of rural households without latrines
   increasing by 8.3 million. This article draws on evidence from two
   coordinated studies in four Indian states. It aims to explore the
   dichotomy of TSC policy and practice, its causes, and the potential of
   the new sanitation campaign, the Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA). The study
   found that TSC implementation was unaligned with the programme's guiding
   principles. In reality the TSC was government-led,
   infrastructure-centred, subsidy-based and supply-led, leading to poor
   outcomes. The reasons behind the theory-practice gap include low
   political priority; flawed monitoring; distorting accountability and
   career incentives; technocratic and paternalistic inertia; and
   corruption. In the new NBA, despite promising changes such as a stronger
   demand creation focus, key issues hampering implementation remain
   ignored. It is thus doomed to fail, burdened by known past hurdles.}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbines are subject to periodic loads that result in a
   time-varying ``trim{''} condition. Linearizing the nonlinear turbine
   dynamics around this trim condition yields a periodic, linear
   time-varying (PLTV) system. A linear time-invariant (LTI) approximation
   is typically obtained in two steps. First, the multi-blade coordinate
   transformation is applied to the PLTV system to obtain a weakly periodic
   system. Second, the state matrices of the weakly periodic system are
   averaged over one period to obtain an LTI approximation. This paper
   presents an alternative approach to construct optimal LTI approximations
   using convex optimization. It is also shown that the multi-blade
   coordinate transformation followed by averaging is equivalent to a
   special case of the proposed convex optimization procedure. The proposed
   approach is demonstrated on a linearized model of a utility-scale
   turbine.}},

   of rotation and the effects of nacelle and tower are not taken into
   account. Dynamic subgrid scale model is employed in the LES. For the
   stand-alone wind turbine case, grid refinement studies with three
   different resolutions are performed. Discrepancies with the wind tunnel
   measurements are observed in the near wake locations (2D and 3D
   downstream). However, very good agreements with the wind tunnel
   measurements are obtained for further downstream locations. For the wind
   farm case, overall good agreements with the wind tunnel measurements are
   obtained for the streamwise variations of the streamwise mean velocity
   and the streamwise turbulence intensity at the bottom and top heights of
   wind turbines. Some discrepancies with the wind tunnel measurements are

Abstract = {{The power density and efficiency of high compression ratio (similar to
   200:1) air compressors/expanders are crucial for the economical
   viability of a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system such as the
   one proposed in {[}1]. There is a trade-off between power density and
   efficiency that is strongly dependent on the heat transfer capability
   within compressor/expander. In previous papers, we have shown that the
   compression or expansion trajectory can be optimized so that for a given
   power, the efficiency can be optimized and vice versa. Theoretically,
   for high compression ratios, the improvement over ad-hoc trajectories
   can be significant-for example, at the same efficiency of 90\%, the
   power can be increased by 3-5 folds {[}2], {[}3], {[}4], {[}5]. Yet, the
   optimal trajectories depend on the heat transfer coefficient profile
   that is often unknown. In this paper, we focus on the experimental study
   of an iterative control algorithm to track a compression trajectory that
   optimizes the efficiency-power trade-off in a liquid piston air
   compressor. First, an adaptive controller is developed to track any
   desired compression trajectory characterized by the temperature-volume
   profile. The controller adaptively estimates the unknown heat transfer
   coefficient. Second, the estimated heat transfer coefficient from one
   iteration is then used to estimate the optimal compression trajectory
   for the next iteration. As the estimate of the heat transfer coefficient
   improves from one iteration to the next, the quality of the estimated
   optimal trajectory also improves. This leads to successively improved
   efficiency. The experimental results of optimal trajectories show up to
   2\% improvement in compression efficiency compared to linear
   trajectories in a same power density.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel sensor for the nonintrusive real-time
   measurement of piston position inside a cylinder. The proposed sensor
   exploits the principle that any ferromagnetic object has an inherent
   magnetic field which varies as a function of position around the object.
   By modeling the magnetic field as a function of position and using
   sensors to measure magnetic field intensity, the position of the object
   can be estimated. This principle is used to measure piston position in a
   free piston engine without requiring any sensors inside the engine
   cylinder. The piston is approximated as a rectangular metallic object
   and the variation of the magnetic field around it is modeled. A
   challenge arises from the fact that the parameters of the model would
   vary from engine to engine and would be cumbersome to calibrate for each
   engine. This challenge is addressed by utilizing two magnetic field
   sensors with known longitudinal separation between them. An iterated
   least squares algorithm then provides adaptive parameter estimates and
   accurate position estimation. Experimental results from a free piston
   engine set up show that the proposed sensor can provide better than 0.4
   mm accuracy in position estimates. The proposed sensing concept can be
   utilized for piston position measurement in multi-cylinder SI and diesel
   engines, hydraulic cylinders and in many other position measurement
   applications.}},

   charge mixing with thermodynamic interaction between fresh charge and
   residual gas during the intake stroke. This work enables operating range
   of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) to be extended without
   loss of stability. Cylinder volume is divided into two zones with a
   fictitious divider. In the mixed zone, fresh charge and residual gas
   expelled from the unmixed zone are mixed homogeneously. Otherwise, the
   unmixed zone contains rest of the residual gas burned in the previous
   cycle and trapped by early close of exhaust valves. Incoming fresh
   charge with high speed expels some of residual gas from the unmixed zone
   to the mixed zone by force. In this perspective, mass transfer
   represents charge mixing between two zones. For model validation,
   optical engine test is carried out. Optical access to the engines with
   an infrared (IR) camera allows graphical analysis to estimate
   thermodynamic states of two zones.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the stabilization of an internal model based
   control system for reference tracking/disturbance rejection, where the
   physical plant is linear time invariant while the generating dynamics of
   the reference/disturbance is time varying. Given the inevitable linear
   time varying (LTV) nature of the internal model unit resulting from the
   time varying generating dynamics, a critical problem to be addressed is
   the design of a low order and robust stabilizer for the entire augmented
   system. While a parameter-dependent output injection based stabilizer
   was introduced in our previous work, the new method proposed in this
   paper reduces the conservativeness in the control synthesis and thus
   enables a more effective control design especially for the problem
   involving LTI physical plant with LTV internal model dynamics. The
   proposed approach is then validated through experimental investigations
   on a camless engine valve actuation system, where robust and precise
   tracking performance is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The atomic force microscope (AFM) is one of the major advances in recent
   science that has enabled imaging of samples at the nanometer scale. Over
   the years, different techniques have been developed to improve the
   speed, resolution and accuracy of imaging using AFM. As AFMs can scan
   and deform material with extremely high resolution, it has also been
   used as a data read-write system where the high or low topography of the
   sample surface are interpreted as a one or a zero bit. Data storage
   using this method can produce extremely high data storage density. In
   this paper a new method called the innovations mismatch method (IM) is
   developed that can be used for both imaging and data storage
   applications. The IM scheme utilizes the dynamic mode of operation and
   therefore is applicable to soft matter interrogation. In this work, IM
   method is shown to outperform previously developed techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Since hydraulic hybrid vehicles are power dense and do not require
   costly batteries, they have the potential to achieve high fuel economy
   and performance and at low cost. The three main classes of hydraulic
   hybrid architectures are series, parallel and hydro-mechanical (HMT) or
   power-split. These architectures have intrinsic differences in
   transmission efficiencies and effectiveness in engine management. This
   paper compares the fuel economies and performance of these architectures
   and validates these features. Using a Toyota Prius like engine and
   chassis as common factors, fuel economies are compared for the
   ``optimal{''} design for each architecture which considers both the
   physical designs and the engine/energy management. Physical design
   variables include pump/motor sizes and gear ratios. The effect of
   pump/motors efficiencies, extra gears and different engine efficiency
   maps are also studied. To improve computational efficiency in evaluating
   fuel economy, engine operation is restricted to several operating modes
   and the accumulator pressure is assumed to be constant. These
   simplifications enable the Lagrange multiplier method to be employed so
   as to quickly determine the optimal engine management control and the
   resulting fuel economy for each design iteration. Full optimal control
   computations without the simplifying assumptions for the optimized
   design for each architecture (using dynamic programming) verify that,
   despite these simplification, the estimated fuel economies are close. It
   is shown that hybrid HMT offers the best fuel economy for various
   hydraulic efficiencies, followed by parallel and series architectures.
   However, the difference between HMT and parallel architectures
   diminishes if the engine has a wide efficient speed range of operation.
   It is also shown that an extra mechanical gear ratio can significantly
   increase fuel economy for all three architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Large area thin films of few-layered unfunctionalized graphene platelets
   are developed with fine control over the thickness. The thin films are
   obtained by a Langmuir-Blodgett assembly at the interface of graphene
   solution in N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and water, and their
   optoelectronic properties and conduction mechanism are investigated in
   relation to lateral flake size and thin film thickness. The electrical
   conductivity and carrier mobility are affected by the flake size (200 nm
   to 1 mu m) and by the packing of the nanostructure platelet network.
   General effective medium theory is used to explain the thickness
   dependent conductivity and to determine the percolation threshold film
   thickness which was found to be about 10 nm (at a volume fraction of
   similar to 39\%) for a Langmuir-Blodgett film of an average platelet
   lateral size of 170 +/- 40 nm. The electronic behaviour of the material
   shows more similarities with polycrystalline turbostratic graphite than
   thin films of reduced graphene oxide, carbon nanotubes, or disordered
   conducting polymers. While in these systems the conduction mechanism is
   often dominated by the presence of an energy barrier between conductive
   and non-conductive regions in the network, in the exfoliated graphene
   networks the conduction mechanism can be explained by the simple
   two-band model which is characteristic of polycrystalline graphite.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a sensor fusion methodology that enhances the
   robustness (here defined as resistance to divergence) of filters used to
   mechanize camera-aided inertial navigation systems (INS). Maintaining
   stability of the filter that fuses camera and INS information can be
   challenging when low quality (consumer/automotive grade) inertial
   sensors are used. This is because the optimal fusion strategy between
   camera pixel measurements and INS relies on a non-linear measurement
   equation which is not well-behaved in some unfavorable landmark
   geometries. In these cases, the filter estimates can diverge. There are
   camera-INS fusion strategies which are less divergence-prone but less
   flexible and accurate. In view of above, it may be beneficial to design
   a filter that can switch between optimal and suboptimal strategies ``on
   the fly{''} depending on the geometry of the landmarks being tracked and
   the quality of the inertial sensor. This paper proposes such a strategy
   based on dual hypothesis testing approach. The proposed approach has the
   advantages of enhancing the robustness while maintaining the estimation
   accuracy. The filter performance is examined and validated using
   simulated UAV flight data.}},

Abstract = {{Concrete pavement thickness data were collected from sections of two
   concrete pavements with a nondestructive testing (NDT) device and by
   measuring concrete core thickness. The NDT device allowed thickness
   measurements every 15 ft compared with 1,000 ft for each core.
   Comparison of the core and NDT data showed that core thickness data do
   not capture the extreme peaks and valleys of pavement thickness
   variation. Further analysis of the core and NDT thickness data with the
   Minnesota Department of Transportation's concrete pavement thickness
   specifications highlighted that contractor pay deductions based on
   thickness deficiencies were not realized. Autocorrelation analysis of
   the data showed that concrete pavement thickness variation is not random
   but is correlated to thicknesses of lag between 30 and 270 ft. This
   correlation lag is a starting point for answering the question, how
   often must a thickness measurement be taken to accurately characterize
   the thickness variation of a concrete pavement?}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we provide a detailed analysis on the venue popularity in
   Foursquare, a leading location-based social network. By collecting 2.4
   million venues from 14 geographic regions all over the world, we study
   the common characteristics of popular venues, and make the following
   observations. First, venues with more complete profile information are
   more likely to be popular. Second, venues in the Food category attract
   the most (43\%) public tips (comments) by users, and the Travel \&
   Transport category is the most popular category with the highest per
   venue check-ins, i.e., each venue in this category attracts on average
   376 check-ins. Moreover, the stickiness of users checking in venues in
   the residence, office, and school categories is higher than in other

Abstract = {{Reducing transmission redundancy is key to the efficiency of wireless
   network broadcast. A standard technique to achieve this is to create a
   network backbone consisting of a subset of nodes that are responsible
   for data forwarding, while other nodes act as passive receivers. On top
   of this, network coding (NC) is often used to further reduce unnecessary
   transmissions. The main problem with this backbone+NC approach is that
   the backbone construction process is blind of what is needed by NC, thus
   may produce a structure with little benefit to the NC algorithms. To
   address this problem, we propose a Coding Opportunity Aware Backbone
   (COAB) construction scheme, which seeks to maximally exploit coding
   opportunities when selecting backbone forwarders. We show that the
   better informed backbone construction process leads to significantly
   increased coding frequency, at minimal cost of localized information
   exchange. The highlight of our work is COAB's broad applicability and
   effectiveness. We integrate COAB with ten state-of-the-art broadcast
   algorithms, specified in eight publications {[}1]-{[}8], and evaluate it
   with prototype implementations with 30 MICAz nodes. The experimental
   results show that our design outperforms the existing schemes
   substantially.}},

Abstract = {{As a pioneering experimental platform of wireless rechargeable sensor
   networks, the Wireless Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP) is an
   open-source platform that integrates sensing and computation
   capabilities to the traditional RFID tags. Different from traditional
   tags, a RFID-based wireless rechargeable sensor node needs to charge its
   onboard energy storage above a threshold in order to power its sensing,
   computation and communication components. Consequently, such charging
   delay imposes a unique design challenge for deploying wireless
   rechargeable sensor networks. In this paper, we tackle this problem by
   planning the optimal movement strategy of the RFID reader, such that the
   time to charge all nodes in the network above their energy threshold is
   minimized. We first propose an optimal solution using the linear
   programming method. To further reduce the computational complexity, we
   then introduce a heuristic solution with a provable approximation ratio
   of (1 + theta)/(1 - epsilon) by discretizing the charging power on a
   two-dimensional space. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate
   that our design outperforms the set-cover-based design by an average of
   24.7\% while the computational complexity is O((N/epsilon)(2)).}},

   Foursquare, a leading location-based social network. By collecting 2.4
   million venues from 14 geographic regions all over the world, we study
   the common characteristics of popular venues, and make the following
   observations. First, venues with more complete profile information are
   more likely to be popular. Second, venues in the Food category attract
   the most (43\%) public tips (comments) by users, and the Travel \&
   Transport category is the most popular category with the highest per
   venue check-ins, i.e., each venue in this category attracts on average
   376 check-ins. Moreover, the stickiness of users checking in venues in
   the residence, office, and school categories is higher than in other
   categories. Last but not least, in general, old venues created at the
   early stage of Foursquare are more popular than new venues. Our results

Title = {{A Review of Piecewise Linearization Methods}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{Various optimization problems in engineering and management are
   formulated as nonlinear programming problems. Because of the
   nonconvexity nature of this kind of problems, no efficient approach is
   available to derive the global optimum of the problems. How to locate a
   global optimal solution of a nonlinear programming problem is an
   important issue in optimization theory. In the last few decades,
   piecewise linearization methods have been widely applied to convert a
   nonlinear programming problem into a linear programming problem or a
   mixed-integer convex programming problem for obtaining an approximated
   global optimal solution. In the transformation process, extra binary
   variables, continuous variables, and constraints are introduced to
   reformulate the original problem. These extra variables and constraints
   mainly determine the solution efficiency of the converted problem. This
   study therefore provides a review of piecewise linearization methods and
   analyzes the computational efficiency of various piecewise linearization
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the relationship between the genotypes and phenotypes of
   individuals is key for identifying genetic variants responsible for
   disease and developing successful therapeutic strategies. Mapping the
   phenotypic effects of individual genetic variants and their combinations
   in human populations presents numerous practical and statistical
   challenges. However, model organisms, such as the budding yeast
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, provide an incredible set of molecular tools
   and advanced technologies that should be able to efficiently perform
   this task. In particular, large-scale genetic interaction screens in
   yeast and other model systems have revealed common properties of genetic
   interaction networks, many of which appear to be maintained over
   extensive evolutionary distances. Indeed, despite relatively low
   conservation of individual genes and their pairwise interactions, the
   overall topology of genetic interaction networks and the connections
   between broad biological processes may be similar in most organisms.
   Taking advantage of these general principles should provide a
   fundamental basis for mapping and predicting genetic interaction
   networks in humans.}},

Abstract = {{External cavity coherent beam combining represents a path forward to
   higher fiber laser radiance, with several groups demonstrating scalable
   approaches. In this paper, we review recent advances in coupled laser
   cavity design. In particular, we compare various designs and describe
   the pros and cons of each with regard to sensitivity to path length
   errors. Experimental measurements using a specially designed dual-core
   fiber demonstrate the modal loss from a superposition architecture. A
   second area of investigation is concerned with Q-switch suppression in
   coupled laser cavities. The increased cavity loss that accompanies path
   length errors in the laser arms can suppress lasing, causing an energy
   build-up in the laser inversion. When the path length errors are removed
   and the cavity resumes its low loss state, the stored energy can be
   released in a manner analogous to Q-switching, creating a giant laser
   pulse. Since the peak power of this pulse can be many orders of
   magnitude larger than the cw power, the high instantaneous intensity can
   cause irreparable damage to optical components. We investigate passive
   systems that are designed to suppress this unwanted Q-switching by
   allowing alternative lasing paths to clamp the gain.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the coupling of oxidative cellulose pyrolysis with
   zeolite-catalyzed upgrading of pyrolysis vapors in a staged autothermal
   reactor over bifunctional combinations of HZSM-5, HFER, or USY with
   Pt/gamma-Al2O3. The pyrolysis vapors formed from oxidative decomposition
   of cellulose passed through a downstream bifunctional zeolite stage to
   form a mixture of aromatics, C-2-C-4 olefins and paraffins, CO, CO2, and
   CH4. A comparison of the bifunctional staged reaction with that of
   monofunctional zeolite catalysts revealed a similar to 13\% increase in
   conversion of pyrolysis vapors to deoxygenated products. Of the
   pyrolysis vapor entering the zeolite catalyst, 24\% was converted to
   aromatics while an additional 20\% was converted to C-2-C-4 olefins and
   paraffins. Complete conversion of cellulose to CO, CO2, light
   hydrocarbons and aromatics was obtained at 500 degrees C upon addition
   of Pt/gamma-Al2O3 to HZSM-5. Deactivation of the catalysts reduced the
   conversion of pyrolysis vapors to deoxygenated products as indicated by
   an increase in the oxygenate yield with time-on-stream. Oxygenate yield
   measured after the zeolite stage increased to 6\% after 30 minutes on
   stream over bifunctional HZSM-5/Pt, and increased from 13\% to 31\% at
   the same time-on-stream over monofunctional HZSM-5. Pt likely promoted
   hydrogenation of the coke precursors produced in the staged reactor
   while the 10-MR pore size of HZSM-5 limited the formation of
   polyaromatic species. A 6\% increase in CO2 yield and 5\% increase in
   CH4 yield was observed when Pt/gamma-Al2O3 was added to each zeolite,
   indicating the possible presence of water-gas-shift and methanation
   reactions, respectively, over Pt sites. The small-scale high-throughput
   autothermal reactor that we describe here is capable of carrying out
   cellulose depolymerization and upgrading in a single-pipe process.}},

Abstract = {{With ultrafast transmission electron microscopy (UTEM), access can be
   gained to the spatiotemporal scales required to directly visualize
   rapid, non-equilibrium structural dynamics of materials. This is
   achieved by operating a transmission electron microscope (TEM) in a
   stroboscopic pump-probe fashion by photoelectrically generating
   coherent, well-timed electron packets in the gun region of the TEM.
   These probe photoelectrons are accelerated down the TEM column where
   they travel through the specimen before reaching a standard,
   commercially-available CCD detector. A second laser pulse is used to
   excite (pump) the specimen in situ. Structural changes are visualized by
   varying the arrival time of the pump laser pulse relative to the probe
   electron packet at the specimen. Here, we discuss how ultrafast
   nanoscale motions of crystalline materials can be visualized and
   precisely quantified using diffraction contrast in UTEM. Because
   diffraction contrast sensitively depends upon both crystal lattice
   orientation as well as incoming electron wavevector, minor
   spatial/directional variations in either will produce dynamic and often
   complex patterns in real-space images. This is because sections of the
   crystalline material that satisfy the Laue conditions may be
   heterogeneously distributed such that electron scattering vectors vary
   over nanoscale regions. Thus, minor changes in either crystal grain
   orientation, as occurs during specimen tilting, warping, or anisotropic
   expansion, or in the electron wavevector result in dramatic changes in
   the observed diffraction contrast. In this way, dynamic contrast
   patterns observed in UTEM images can be used as sensitive indicators of
   ultrafast specimen motion. Further, these motions can be
   spatiotemporally mapped such that direction and amplitude can be
   determined.}},

   Signs and Dedicated Short-Range Communication}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2380}},
Pages = {{29-35}},
Abstract = {{The future deployment of dedicated short-range communication (DSRC)
   technology requires that applications with their bases in DSRC be
   integrated with existing traffic management techniques so that vehicles
   not equipped with DSRC at the early stage of DSRC deployment can also
   reap the potential benefits of DSRC technology. A hybrid traffic
   information system was successfully developed; it combines DSRC
   technology and portable changeable message signs (PCMSs) for use in the
   work zone environment to improve traffic mobility and thereby driver
   safety. The developed system uses DSRC-based vehicle-to-infrastructure
   and vehicle-to-vehicle communication to acquire travel safety
   parameters, such as travel time (TT) and the starting location of
   congestion (SLoC), and to disseminate these parameters to DSRC-equipped
   vehicles and PCMSs, which are strategically placed along the roadside.
   Through the use of the DSRC-PCMS interface developed and demonstrated in
   this work, PCMSs can receive these travel safety parameters from nearby
   DSRC-equipped vehicles on the road through DSRC-based vehicle-to-vehicle
   communication, and display them for the drivers of vehicles that lack
   DSRC capability. Such a system can be useful during the early stage of
   DSRC deployment when DSRC market penetration is low. In addition, a
   rigorous analysis was conducted to investigate the minimum DSRC market
   penetration rate needed for successful functionality of the developed
   system with respect to both acquisition and dissemination of TT and
   SLoC. Through the use of a realistic traffic flow model, guidelines were
   developed to estimate a minimum DSRC penetration rate needed to deploy
   the developed system for a variety of traffic scenarios on a given work
   zone road.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in genome engineering provide newfound control over a
   plant's genetic material. It is now possible for most bench scientists
   to alter DNA in living plant cells in a variety of ways, including
   introducing specific nucleotide substitutions in a gene that change a
   protein's amino acid sequence, deleting genes or chromosomal segments,
   and inserting foreign DNA at precise genomic locations. Such targeted
   DNA sequence modifications are enabled by sequence-specific nucleases
   that create double-strand breaks in the genomic loci to be altered. The
   repair of the breaks, through either homologous recombination or
   nonhomologous end joining, can be controlled to achieve the desired
   sequence modification. Genome engineering promises to advance basic
   plant research by linking DNA sequences to biological function. Further,
   genome engineering will enable plants' biosynthetic capacity to be
   harnessed to produce the many agricultural products required by an
   expanding world population.}},

Abstract = {{MapReduce has been designed to accommodate large-scale data-intensive
   workloads running on large single-site homogeneous clusters. Researchers
   have begun to explore the extent to which the original MapReduce
   assumptions can be relaxed including skewed workloads, iterative
   applications, and heterogeneous computing environments. Our work
   continues this exploration by applying MapReduce across widely
   distributed data over distributed computation resources. This problem
   arises when datasets are generated at multiple sites as is common in
   many scientific domains and increasingly e-commerce applications. It
   also occurs when multi-site resources such as geographically separated
   data centers are applied to the same MapReduce job. Using Hadoop, we
   show that the absence of network and node homogeneity and locality of
   data lead to poor performance. The problem is that interaction of
   MapReduce phases becomes pronounced in the presence of heterogeneous
   network behavior. In this paper, we propose new cross-phase optimization
   techniques that enable independent MapReduce phases to influence one
   another.
   We propose techniques that optimize the push and map phases to enable
   push-map overlap and to allow map behavior to feed back into push
   dynamics. Similarly, we propose techniques that optimize the map and
   reduce phases to enable shuffle cost to feed back and affect map
   scheduling decisions. We evaluate the benefits of our techniques in both
   Amazon EC2 and PlanetLab. The experimental results show the potential of
   these techniques as performance is improved from 7\%-18\% depending on
   the execution environment and application.}},

Abstract = {{Assessment of gene function oftentimes requires mutant populations that
   can be screened by forward or reverse genetic analysis. The situation
   becomes more complicated in polyploidy or paleopolyploid genomes that
   have two or more copies for most genes. Here we describe a method for
   engineering zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) for the purpose of creating
   targeted mutations in the paleopolyploid soybean genome. ZFNs are
   recombinant proteins composed of an engineered zinc-finger array fused
   to a nonspecific cleavage domain. When engineered to recognize a
   specific nucleotide sequence, the cleavage domain will generate highly
   mutagenic DNA double-strand breaks frequently resulting in insertions
   and deletions at the target locus. Depending on the number of target
   sites present within the genome, this method has the capacity to target
   either single- or multi-copy gene families. In this chapter, we describe
   an inexpensive, rapid, and user-friendly approach for ZFN assembly and
   application in soybean based on the previously described
   context-dependent assembly method.}},

Abstract = {{While Near-Threshold Voltage Computing (NTC) is a promising approach to
   push back the manycore power wall, it suffers from a high sensitivity to
   parameter variations. One possible way to cope with variations is to use
   multiple on-chip voltage (V-dd) domains. However, this paper finds that
   such an approach is energy inefficient. Consequently, for NTC, we
   propose a manycore organization that has a single V-dd domain and relies
   on multiple frequency domains to tackle variation. We call it
   EnergySmart. For this approach to be competitive, it has to be paired
   with effective core assignment strategies and also support fine-grain
   (i.e., short-interval) DVFS. This paper shows that, at NTC, a simple
   chip with a single V-dd domain can deliver a higher performance per watt
   than one with multiple V-dd domains.}},

Abstract = {{To reach the goal set by the United States Department of Energy to
   replace 30\% of 2004 gasoline usage with biofuels by 2030, the U. S.
   will need to consider diverse biomass feedstock sources, such as the
   plant genus Alnus. This genus contains nitrogen-fixing species that grow
   in a wide variety of challenging conditions. This study focused on 13
   species of Alnus and was designed to determine survival, and above
   ground biomass production in five diverse environments unsuitable for
   food production agriculture in Minnesota, USA. Additionally, seven Salix
   and four Populus selections, that have been tested in short rotation
   woody biomass systems, were included for comparative analysis. Ten of
   the 13 Alnus species died from winter injury at all locations or
   produced above ground biomass at levels well below individual site
   averages. These ten Alnus species are not well suited for the soils and
   climate in the upper Great Lakes region. However, three species, A.
   glutinosa, A. incana, and A. viridis exceeded 90\% survival at all five
   sites and produced significantly more aboveground biomass than the other
   Alnus species. On a low-nitrogen site with coarse sandy soils, the three
   species produced an average of 5.35 megagrams per hectare of above
   ground biomass over a three year period. This exceeded the biomass
   production of all other materials in the trial including commercially
   available Populus and Salix selections confirming the a priori
   expectation that Alnus' potential symbiosis with nitrogen-fixing
   bacteria promotes increased growth on low fertility soils.}},

Abstract = {{Development of various techniques such as lane departure warning (LDW)
   systems can improve traffic safety significantly. A lane departure
   warning system should be able to detect when the driver is in danger of
   departing the road and then trigger an alarm to warn the driver early
   enough to take corrective action. This paper presents the development of
   a prototype LDW system. It is mainly an image-based approach to find the
   vehicle's lateral characteristics and then uses that information to
   establish an operation algorithm to determine whether a warning signal
   should be issued based on the status of the vehicle deviating from its
   heading lane. The system developed takes a mixed approach by integrating
   the Lucas-Kanade (L-K) optical flow and the Hough transform-based lane
   detection methods in its implementation. The L-K point tracking is used
   when the lane boundaries cannot be detected, while the lane detection
   technique is used when they become available. Even though both
   techniques are used in the system, only one method is activated at any
   given time because each technique has its own advantages and also
   disadvantages. The developed LDW system was road tested on I-35, US-53,
   and several rural highways. Overall, the system operates correctly as
   expected with a false alarm occurred only roughly about 1.18\% of the
   operation time. This paper presents the system implementation together
   with findings.}},

Abstract = {{In a number of orthopaedic surgeries, balancing the tensile forces in
   the soft tissues surrounding bone is important for good restoration of
   overall limb function in the patient and a long lasting implant. This
   paper presents an analytical formulation for a handheld device which can
   be used to measure tension in the soft tissues surrounding bone. The
   handheld device can be pushed against a tense segment of any soft tissue
   to measure the site specific axial tension in the tissue. The device
   uses an array of three force (or displacement) sensors and estimates the
   tension in the string based upon an analytical formula that utilizes
   these three readings. Two different realizations of the device and their
   experimental results are presented which confirm the theoretical

Abstract = {{Existing robotic surgical platforms face limitations which include the
   balance between the scale of the robot and its capability in terms of
   range of motion, load capacity, and tool manipulation. These limitations
   can be overcome by taking advantage of fluid power as an enabling
   technology with its inherent power density and controllability. As a
   proof-of-concept for this approach, we are pursuing the design of a
   novel, dexterous robotic surgical tool targeted towards transgastric
   natural orifice surgery.
   The design for this hydraulic surgical platform and the corresponding
   analysis are presented to demonstrate the theoretical system performance
   in terms of tool positioning and input requirements. The design involves
   a combination of a novel 3D valve, hydraulic artificial muscles, and
   multi-segmented flexible manipulator arms that fit in the lumen of an
   endoscope. A dynamic model of the system is created. Numerical
   simulations show that a hydraulic endoscopic surgical robot can produce
   the desired performance without using large external manipulators such
   as those employed by conventional surgical robots. They also provide
   insight into the component interactions and input response of the
   system. Future work will include manufacturing a prototype to validate
   the concept and the numerical models.}},

Abstract = {{Deltas are economic and environmental hotspots, food baskets for many
   nations, home to a large part of the world population, and hosts of
   exceptional biodiversity and rich ecosystems. Deltas, being at the land
   water interface, are international, regional, and local transport hubs,
   thus providing the basis for intense economic activities. Yet, deltas
   are disappearing and deteriorating at an alarming rate as ``victims{''}
   of human actions (e.g. water and sediment reduction due to upstream
   basin development), climatic impacts (e.g. sea level rise and flooding
   from rivers and intense tropical storms), and local exploration (e.g.
   sand or aggregates, groundwater and hydrocarbon extraction). Although
   many efforts exist on individual deltas around the world, a
   comprehensive global delta sustainability initiative that promotes
   awareness, science integration, data and knowledge sharing, and
   development of decision support tools for an effective dialogue between
   scientists, managers and policy makers is lacking. Recently, the
   international scientific community proposed to establish the
   International Year of Deltas (IYD) to serve as the beginning of such a
   Global Delta Sustainability Initiative. The IYD was proposed as a year
   to: (1) increase awareness and attention to the value and vulnerability
   of deltas worldwide; (2) promote and enhance international and regional
   cooperation at the scientific, policy, and stakeholder level; and (3)
   serve as a launching pad for a 10-year committed effort to understand
   deltas as complex socio-ecological systems and ensure preparedness in
   protecting and restoring them in a rapidly changing environment. This
   paper articulates the vision for such an initiative as developed by a
   large number of international experts (see contributing authors) and
   pleads for a comprehensive and coordinated effort that spans continents
   and environments to demonstrate that indeed these ``hot spots of
   vulnerability and change{''} can become again ``seedbeds of
   sustainability and resilience.{''}}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a joint timing synchronization and channel
   estimation scheme for communications systems with multiple transmit
   antennas based on a well-designed training sequence arrangement. In
   addition, a generalized maximum-likelihood (ML) channel estimation
   scheme is presented, and this one-shot scheme is applied to obtain all
   channel impulse responses (CIR) from different transmit antennas. The
   proposed approach consists of three stages at each receive antenna.
   First, coarse timing and frequency offset estimates are obtained. Then,
   an advanced timing, relative timing indices, and the corresponding CIR
   estimates at the second stage are obtained using the generalized ML
   estimation based on a sliding observation vector. Finally, the fine time
   adjustment based on the minimum mean squared error criterion is
   performed. From the simulation results, the proposed approach has
   excellent performance in timing synchronization under several channel
   models at signal-to-noise ratio smaller than 1dB.}},

Abstract = {{The DNA nanofilter is a microfabricated electrophoretic separation
   device consisting of a periodic array of thin slits (circa 60 nm)
   separated by deeper wells (circa 320 nm). We demonstrate that this
   device can act as a tuneable, clog-free filter when operating in a low
   frequency, asymmetric field inversion mode. This filtration occurs by
   using asymmetric field inversion to achieve bi-directional migration of
   short (less than 1000 bp) DNA. Moreover, similar ratchet-type operation
   can improve separations when compared to a constant field separation in
   the same device. These modes of operation enhance the utility of the DNA
   nanofilter as a component of integrated lab-on-a-chip devices. The
   experimental data confirm theoretical predictions for the bidirectional

Abstract = {{A beat-to-beat alternation in the duration of the action potential (APD)
   of myocytes, i.e. alternans, is believed to be a direct precursor of
   ventricular fibrillation (VF) in the whole heart. A common technique for
   the prediction of alternans uses the restitution curve, the nonlinear
   functional relationship between the APD and the preceding diastolic
   interval (DI). It was proposed that alternans appears when the magnitude
   of the slope of the restitution curve exceeds one, known as the
   restitution hypothesis. However, this restitution hypothesis was derived
   in the presence of feedback, i.e. the partial dependence of the DI on
   the immediate preceding APD. Physiologically, the heart rate exhibits
   substantial variations, known as heart rate variability (HRV), which
   might affect the feedback relationship. In this manuscript, we aim to
   investigate the effect of feedback on alternans formation in the heart.}},

Abstract = {{This project focuses on the use of magnetoresistive and sonar sensors
   for imminent collision detection in cars. The magnetoresistive sensors
   are used to measure the magnetic field from another vehicle in close
   proximity, so as to estimate relative position, velocity and orientation
   of the vehicle from the measurement.
   An analytical formulation is presented for the planar variation of the
   magnetic field from a car as a function of two dimensional position and
   orientation. While this relationship itself can be used to estimate
   position and orientation, a challenge is posed by the fact that the
   parameters in the analytical function vary with the type and model of
   the encountered car. Since the type of vehicle encountered is not known
   apriori, the parameters in the magnetic field function are unknown. The
   use of both sonar and magnetoresisitive sensors and an adaptive
   estimator is shown to address this problem. While the sonar sensors do
   not work at very small inter-vehicle distance and have low refresh
   rates, their use during a short initial time duration leads to a
   reliable estimator. Experimental results are presented for a laboratory
   wheeled car door and show that planar position, relative angular
   position and orientation can be accurately estimated for a range of
   relative motions at different oblique angles.}},

Abstract = {{To increase the efficiency of hydraulic systems by eliminating valve
   throttling losses, a direct displacement open circuit is proposed to
   control a single rod hydraulic actuator. The circuit provides three
   control inputs, including the displacement of a variable displacement
   pump, the opening area of a proportional valve, and the position of a
   directional valve. Pump control has a low bandwidth, but the efficiency
   is high due to the lack of throttling losses. Valve control has a high
   bandwidth, but the throttling loss is high. A novel approach has been
   proposed to distribute the control efforts between the pump and the
   proportional valve considering both control bandwidth balancing and
   throttling loss reduction. The proportional valve will follow a high
   frequency opening profile, while the nominal valve opening is large, and
   the pump output flow will follow a low frequency demand. Experimental
   results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

Abstract = {{The power density and variable compliance in pneumatic actuators makes
   them an attractive option for actuation in human assistive devices.
   Interaction safety in these devices can be robustly achieved through
   energetically passive controllers. Efficacy of these controllers depends
   on appropriate definition of actuator energy function. In previous
   works, the energy fimction was defined by assuming the thermodynamic
   process in the actuator to be either isothermal or adiabatic. In the
   current paper an estimate of work potential suitable for passivity
   analysis of a single chambered pneumatic actuator with finite heat
   transfer is reported. The energy function is developed by maximizing the
   work done on the actuator to reach an equilibrium position. Optimal
   conditions show that the maximal solution is attained if the
   thermodynamic process is a combination of adiabatic and isothermal
   processes. Through this storage function it is shown that the heat
   transfer has dissipative affect on the power flow in the pneumatic
   actuator, irrespective of the chamber air temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen plays a key role in the energy metabolism of living organisms.
   Any imbalance in the oxygen levels will affect the metabolic homeostasis
   and lead to pathophysiological diseases. Hypoxia, a status of low tissue
   oxygen, is a key factor in tumor biology as it is highly prominent in
   tumor tissues. However, clinical tools for assessing tissue oxygenation
   are limited. The gold standard is polarographic needle electrode which
   is invasive and not capable of mapping (imaging) the oxygen content in
   tissue.
   We applied the method of photoacoustic lifetime imaging (PALI) of
   oxygen-sensitive dye to small animal tissue hypoxia research. PALI is
   new technology for direct, non-invasive imaging of oxygen. The technique
   is based on mapping the oxygen-dependent transient optical absorption of
   Methylene Blue (MB) by pump-probe photoacoustic imaging. Our studies
   show the feasibility of imaging of dissolved oxygen distribution in
   phantoms. In vivo experiments demonstrate that the hypoxia region is
   consistent with the site of subcutaneously xenografted prostate tumor in
   mice with adequate spatial resolution and penetration depth.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},

Pages = {{11051-11060}},
Abstract = {{A method is developed for encapsulation of bacterial biocatalysts in
   silica gels formed by silica nanoparticles (SNP) and a silicon alkoxide
   crosslinker. Formulation of the gel was optimized by changing the SNP
   size, SNP to crosslinker ratio and crosslinker functionality. Hydrolysis
   and condensation reactions of silicon alkoxide were controlled by water
   to alkoxide ratio (r) and pH of the solution. FTIR analysis verified
   that a reactive and temporally stable silicon alkoxide crosslinker was
   obtained. As a case study, recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells
   expressing the atrazine dechlorinating enzyme AtzA were encapsulated.
   Synthesized catalytic biomaterials (silica gel encapsulated bacterial
   biocatalysts) were evaluated based on their gelation time, biocatalytic
   activity and mechanical strength. Diffusivity assays and SEM were used
   for characterization of the gel structure. We found that SNP to
   crosslinker ratio affected all the features of the gel, whereas
   crosslinker functionality primarily affected the gelation time and SNP
   size affected the mechanical strength and diffusivity. Based on
   systematic evaluation, we selected three gel formulations and subjected
   them to long-term activity measurements in a continuous-flow bioreactor
   for removing trace levels of atrazine. The effluent atrazine
   concentration was sustained below 30\% of the influent concentration, <3
   ppb, for 2 months.}},

Abstract = {{We report the first time-dependent measurements of high-molecular-weight
   (up to 700 amu) gas-phase oxidation products from alpha-pinene
   ozonolysis in an aerosol chamber under dry and low-NOx conditions.
   Measurements of products having mole fractions ranging from 10(-14) to
   10(-11) were carried out with a chemical ionization mass spectrometer
   (the Cluster CIMS). Most products that were correlated with number
   concentrations of the smallest particles measured (10-20 nm) had
   molecular weights in the 430-560 amu range. Those products are proposed
   to be likely responsible for the initial nuclei formation and the early
   growth of the freshly nucleated particles based on their high molecular
   weights and chemical identities, both of which suggest low-volatility
   compounds. Another group of oxidation products in the lower mass range
   of 140-380 amu was well correlated with particles larger than 20 nm. We
   postulate that those products contributed to the later growth of
   particles (i.e., larger than 20 nm in diameter). Although particle
   nucleation in this study was primarily due to condensation of oxidation
   products from alpha-pinene ozonolysis, the involvement of residual
   sulfuric acid vapor in particle nucleation cannot be totally excluded.}},

Abstract = {{The Gibbs free energy of solvation and dissociation of hydrogen chloride

   the Gibbs free energy of transfer of molecular HCl from the vapor to the
   aqueous liquid phase and the standard-state Gibbs free energy of acid
   dissociation of HCl in aqueous solution. The former quantity is
   calculated using Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations using either
   Kohn-Sham density functional theory or a molecular mechanics force field
   to determine the system's potential energy. The latter Gibbs free energy
   contribution is computed using a continuum solvation model utilizing
   either experimental reference data or micro-solvated clusters. The

   the contrast mechanism of a new photoacoustic activatable probe that
   changes its excitation lifetime upon activation. The excitation decay of
   methylene blue (MB), a chromophore commonly used in therapeutic and
   diagnostic applications, is probed by photoacoustic lifetime contrast
   imaging (PLCI). The monomer of the dye presents a high-quantum yield of
   intersystem-crossing and long lifetime (70 mu s) whereas the dimer is
   statically quenched with a short lifetime (a few ns). This forms the
   basis of a highly sensitive contrast mechanism between monomers and
   dimers. Two dimerization models - one using sodium sulfate, the other
   using sodium dodecyl sulfate - were applied to control the
   monomer-to-dimer ratio in MB solutions. Preliminary results show that
   the photoacoustic signal of a dimer solution is efficiently suppressed
   (> 20 dB) due to their short lifetime compared to the monomer sample.
   Flash-photolysis of the same solutions reveals a 99\% decrease in
   transient absorption confirming PLCI results. This contrast mechanism
   can be applied to design a MB dual-labeled activatable probe bound by an
   enzyme-specific cleavable peptide linker. When the probe is cleaved by
   its target, MB molecules will separate by molecular diffusion and
   recover their long excitation lifetime enabling their detection by PLCI.
   Our long-term goal is to investigate enzyme-specific imaging in small
   animals and establish pre-clinical data for translational research and
   implementation of the technology in clinical applications.}},

   the prospect of kinetically coupling dehydrogenation and deoxygenation
   cycles results instead in a two-zone, staged bed reactor configuration
   consisting of upstream oxygenate/CH4 reforming and downstream CH4
   dehydroaromatization. The addition of an oxygenate co-feed
   (oxygenate/CH4 = 0.01-0.03) causes oxidation of the active molybdenum
   carbide catalyst while producing CO and H-2 until completely converted.
   Forward rates of C6H6 synthesis are unaffected by the introduction of an
   oxygenate co-feed after rigorously accounting for the thermodynamic
   reversibility caused by the H-2 produced in oxygenate reforming
   reactions and the fraction of the active catalyst deemed unavailable for
   CH4 DHA. All effects of co-processing oxygenates with CH4 can be
   construed in terms of an approach to equilibrium.}},

Abstract = {{The block coordinate descent (BCD) method is widely used for minimizing
   a continuous function f of several block variables. At each iteration of
   this method, a single block of variables is optimized, while the
   remaining variables are held fixed. To ensure the convergence of the BCD
   method, the subproblem of each block variable needs to be solved to its
   unique global optimal. Unfortunately, this requirement is often too
   restrictive for many practical scenarios. In this paper, we study an
   alternative inexact BCD approach which updates the variable blocks by
   successively minimizing a sequence of approximations of f which are
   either locally tight upper bounds of f or strictly convex local
   approximations of f. The main contributions of this work include the
   characterizations of the convergence conditions for a fairly wide class
   of such methods, especially for the cases where the objective functions
   are either nondifferentiable or nonconvex. Our results unify and extend
   the existing convergence results for many classical algorithms such as
   the BCD method, the difference of convex functions (DC) method, the
   expectation maximization (EM) algorithm, as well as the block
   forward-backward splitting algorithm, all of which are popular for large
   scale optimization problems involving big data.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanical behavior of a three-dimensional cross-linked fiber
   network embedded in a matrix is studied in this work. The network is
   composed from linear elastic fibers which store energy only in the axial
   deformation mode, while the matrix is also isotropic and linear elastic.
   Such systems are encountered in a broad range of applications, from
   tissue to consumer products. As the matrix modulus increases, the
   network is constrained to deform more affinely. This leads to internal
   forces acting between the network and the matrix, which produce strong
   stress concentration at the network cross-links. This interaction
   increases the apparent modulus of the network and decreases the apparent
   modulus of the matrix. A model is developed to predict the effective
   modulus of the composite and its predictions are compared with numerical
   data for a variety of networks.}},

   of critical importance for assessing aerosol radiative forcing and
   improving air quality control. A key quantity describing the
   gas-to-particle conversion is the rate at which nanoparticles of certain

   nanoparticle formation rates requires precise knowledge of growth rates.
   Here we present a newly developed DMA train capable of providing
   definitive growth rates from size distribution scan frequencies of 1 Hz.
   This system has proven to yield statistically significant data even at
   ultra-low post-classification concentrations of 0.1 cm(-3). A chamber

Abstract = {{Measurements of aerosol number distributions down to one molecule have
   provided information that we've used to develop a new approach for
   modeling atmospheric nucleation rates. Measurements were carried out
   with the Cluster Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer (Cluster CIMS),
   the scanning mobility spectrometer using a diethylene glycol
   condensation particle counter as detector (DEG SMPS), and an ambient
   pressure proton transfer mass spectrometer for ammonia and amines
   (AmPMS). The model explains nucleation as a result of cluster evolution
   due to a sequence of acid-base reactions. We conclude that the smallest
   stable cluster contains four sulfuric acid molecules. The model leads to
   a simple analytic expression for nucleation rates that is reasonably
   consistent (i.e., +/- 10x) with atmospheric observations. The model
   predicts that nucleation rates are equal to a prefactor, P<1, times the
   sulfuric acid vapor collision rate, (i.e., J=P.0.5.k(11)

Abstract = {{Observations of aerosol hygroscopic growth and CCN activation spectra
   for submicron particles are reported for the T1 ground site outside of
   Mexico City during the MIRAGE 2006 campaign. kappa-Kohler theory is used
   to evaluate the characteristic hygroscopicity parameter, kappa{*}, for
   the CCN active aerosol population using both size-resolved HTMDA and
   size-resolved CCNc measurements. Organic mass fractions (f(org)) are
   evaluated from size-resolved aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS)
   measurements, from which predictions of the hygroscopicity parameter are
   compared against kappa{*}. Strong diurnal changes in aerosol water
   uptake parameters and aerosol composition are observed. We find that new
   particle formation (NPF) events are correlated with an increased
   kappa{*} and CCN-active fraction during the daytime, with greater impact
   on smaller particles. During NPF events, the number concentration of 40
   nm particles acting as CCN at 0.51\%+/- 0.06\% supersaturation can
   surpass by more than a factor of two the corresponding concentrations of
   100 nm particles. We also find that at 06:00-08:00 LT throughout the
   campaign, fresh traffic emissions result in substantial changes to the
   chemical distribution of the aerosol, with on average 65\% externally
   mixed fraction for 40 nm particles and 30\% externally mixed fraction
   for 100 nm particles, whereas at midday nearly all particles of both
   sizes can be described as ``internally mixed{''}. Average activation
   spectra and growth factor distributions are analyzed for different time
   periods characterizing the daytime (with and without NPF events), the
   early morning ``rush hour{''} and the entire campaign. We show that
   kappa{*} derived from CCNc measurements decreases as a function of size
   during all time periods, while the CCN-active fraction increases as a
   function of size. Size-resolved AMS measurements do not predict the
   observed trend for kappa{*} versus particle size, which can be
   attributed to unresolved mixing state and the presence of refractory
   material not measured by the AMS. Measured kappa{*} typically ranges
   from 0.2 to 0.35, and organics typically make up 60-85\% of the aerosol
   mass in the size range studied. We show that kappa(AMS) is able to
   describe CCN concentrations reasonably well, provided mixing-state
   information is available, especially at the highest CCN concentrations.
   This is consistent with other CCN studies carried out in urban
   environments, and is partly due to the fact that the highest CCN
   concentrations occur during the daytime when the aerosol is internally
   mixed. During the early morning rush hour, however, failing to account
   for the aerosol mixing state results in systematic overestimation of CCN
   concentrations by as much as 50-100\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in understanding electronic charge transport in organic
   semiconductors are motivated by the fast growth of organic electronics.
   In particular, organic single crystals provide an ideal test bed for
   systematic studies of charge transport, with rapid progress in
   single-crystal-based field-effect transistors in the past few years.
   Charge densities induced in crystals by the field-effect have been in
   the low limit regime (10(10) cm(-2) to 10(13) cm(-2)) mainly due to the
   difficulties of boosting gate dielectric capacitance. Consequently, the
   transport physics of organic crystals in the high-charge-density regime
   has not been systematically explored. With the emergence of the
   electrolyte gating technique, ultrahigh charge densities (10(13) cm(-2)
   to 1015 cm-2) can be achieved. In this article, we first discuss the
   general methodologies of applying electrolyte gating to organic
   crystals. We then review several recent research highlights, including
   the maximization of charge density and improvement of carrier mobility,
   enhanced understanding of the mobility-charge density relationship, and
   observations of ambipolar transport and a novel conductivity peak that
   occurs only at high charge densities. These recent achievements are
   extremely important for ongoing efforts to realize novel transport
   behavior in organic crystals, such as superconductivity and the
   insulator-to-metal transition.}},

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},

Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{Large-scale wind farms, covering a significant portion of the land and
   ocean surface, may affect the transport of momentum, heat, mass and
   moisture between the atmosphere and the land locally and globally. To
   understand the wind-farm-atmosphere interaction, we conducted
   wind-tunnel experiments to study the surface scalar (heat) flux using
   model wind farms, consisting of more than ten rows of wind
   turbines-having typical streamwise and spanwise spacings of five and
   four rotor diameters-in a neutral boundary layer with a heated surface.
   The spatial distribution of the surface heat flux was mapped with an
   array of surface heat flux sensors within the quasi-developed regime of
   the wind-farm flow. Although the overall surface heat flux change
   produced by the wind farms was found to be small, with a net reduction
   of 4\% for a staggered wind farm and nearly zero change for an aligned
   wind farm, the highly heterogeneous spatial distribution of the surface
   heat flux, dependent on the wind-farm layout, was significant. The
   difference between the minimum and maximum surface heat fluxes could be
   up to 12\% and 7\% in aligned and staggered wind farms, respectively.
   This finding is important for planning intensive agriculture practice
   and optimizing farm land use strategy regarding wind energy project
   development. The well-controlled wind-tunnel experiments presented in
   this study also provide a first comprehensive dataset on turbulent flow
   and scalar transport in wind farms, which can be further used to develop
   and validate new parameterizations of surface scalar fluxes in numerical
   models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a mapping method for the analysis of guidance
   performance. Spatial state and time-to-go maps, along with their
   statistics, are computed from an ensemble of trajectories. The mapping
   technique is motivated by the concept of spatial value function
   associated with an optimal guidance model. For illustration, the method
   is applied to trajectories collected from a human-operated miniature
   helicopter in a precision interception task. The closed-loop dynamics of
   the helicopter under human control was modeled as a mass-point system.
   The closed-loop model provides a formal interpretation for the extracted
   maps and is also used to compute optimal trajectories that serve as
   absolute baseline for the guidance performance. The maps extracted from
   the experimental trajectories show that human guidance performance is
   sufficiently stationary and spatially coherent to be meaningfully
   embedded in a spatial map. The comparison with the optimal baseline
   makes it possible to identify the subject's specific performance gaps.
   Performance metrics that are defined and computed on hand of the maps
   enable more detailed assessment of the operator's performance. The
   general results demonstrate that the guidance performance of a trained
   subject can be meaningfully modeled as a guidance policy based on a
   simple closed-loop mass-point model.}},

   photon-counting histogram (PCH) separates the brightness of rare, bright
   particles from a dominant background. In a practical vein for ensuring
   quantitative and unbiased brightness data, we address a number of
   potential issues stemming from both theoretical assumptions and
   experimental realities. Two additional issues arising from geometry are
   examined in greater detail. An oil-immersion objective skews the
   geometry of the excitation volume as a function of penetration depth.
   The bias can be characterized and corrected or avoided through the use
   of a water-immersion objective. Brightness measurements in thin sample
   geometries, frequently encountered in cells, may be biased. We use
   z-scan FFS to characterize sample geometry and correct any resulting

Abstract = {{Time-integrated fluorescence cumulant analysis (TIFCA) is a data
   analysis technique for fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) that
   extracts information from the cumulants of the integrated fluorescence
   intensity. It is the first exact theory that describes the effect of
   sampling time on FFS experiment. Rebinning of data to longer sampling
   times helps to increase the signal/noise ratio of the experimental
   cumulants of the photon counts. The sampling time dependence of the
   cumulants encodes both brightness and diffusion information of the
   sample. TIFCA analysis extracts this information by fitting the
   cumulants to model functions. Generalization of TIFCA to multicolor FFS
   experiment is straightforward. Here, we present an overview of the
   theory, its implementation, as well as the benefits and requirements of
   TIFCA. The questions of why, when, and how to use TIFCA will be
   discussed. We give several examples of practical applications of TIFCA,

Abstract = {{It is common for jets of fluid to interact with crossflow. This article
   reviews our understanding of the physical behavior of this important
   class of flow in the incompressible and compressible regimes.
   Experiments have significantly increased in sophistication over the past
   few decades, and recent experiments provide data on turbulence
   quantities and scalar mixing. Quantitative data at high speeds are less
   common, and visualization still forms an important component in
   estimating penetration and mixing. Simulations have progressed from the
   Reynolds-averaged methodology to large-eddy and hybrid methodologies.
   There is a general consensus on the qualitative structure of the flow at
   low speeds; however, the flow structure at low-velocity ratios (jet
   speed/crossflow speed) might be fundamentally different from the common
   notion of shear-layer vortices, counter-rotating vortex pairs, wakes,
   and horseshoe vortices. Fluid in the near field is strongly accelerated,
   which affects the jet trajectory, entrainment, and mixing behavior. At
   low speeds, mixing depends more on Reynolds number than the jet
   trajectory or spatial extent does. Turbulence kinetic energy budgets are
   discussed that reveal the considerable nonequilibrium nature of the flow
   and the consequent challenges posed to time-averaged prediction
   methodologies. The parameter space at high speeds is fairly large, and
   even experimentally derived correlations for trajectories show
   significant scatter. Coherent motions in high-speed jets are seen to
   entrain large amounts of crossflow fluid but do not mix effectively in
   the near field.}},

Abstract = {{Phenomenological models and hybrid phenomenological-chemometric models
   were developed to predict natural organic matter (NOM) removal based on
   the real water treatment data from the city of Minneapolis over a 3 year
   period. The analysis of the modeling results showed that the
   phenomenological model was able to capture the major variations of NOM
   removal but it tended to over predict the NOM removal in independent
   data sets. These results could be significantly improved by the hybrid
   model, which was less biased and much more accurate than the
   phenomenological model. The phenomenological model parameters showed low
   statistical confidence because the available data, collected in real
   water treatment conditions, was not sufficiently informative to identify
   the complex model structure. By comparison, the hybrid modeling method
   enabled a more reliable discrimination of the most important factors
   affecting NOM removal. The final hybrid model was implemented in an
   Excel spreadsheet and can be easily used for NOM removal prediction and
   the control of chemical dosing.}},

Abstract = {{Six Korea high oil (KHO) corn varieties varying in germ and endosperm

   bioethanol and biodiesel. Production parameters including
   saccharification, bioethanol yield, biodiesel yield and composition, and

   endosperm size, oil, and non-oil solid mass on the production parameters
   strongly depended on the processing routes, namely M-F-T, M-T-F, and S-T
   vertical bar F. The M-F-T route produced the highest bioethanol yield
   while the S-TIF route produced the highest biodiesel yield. The in situ
   transesterification reaction, if proceeded before fermentation, reduced
   the bioethanol yield while fermentation and/or presence of endosperm
   reduced the biodiesel yield. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{ENERGY}},

Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{This paper explores the use of molten alkali-carbonate salts as a
   reaction and heat transfer medium for steam gasification of plant
   biomass with the objectives of enhanced heat transfer, faster kinetics,
   and increased thermal capacitance compared to gasification in an inert
   gas. The intended application is a solar process in which concentrated
   solar radiation is the sole source of heat to drive the endothermic
   production of synthesis gas. The benefits of gasification in a molten
   ternary blend of lithium, potassium, and sodium carbonate salts is
   demonstrated for cellulose, switchgrass, a blend of perennial plants,
   and corn stover through measurements of reaction rate and product
   composition in an electrically heated reactor. The feedstocks are
   gasified with steam at 1200 K in argon and in the molten salt. The use
   of molten salt increases the total useful syngas production by up to
   25\%, and increases the reactivity index by as much as 490\%. Secondary
   products, in the form of condensable tar, are reduced by 77\%. (C) 2012

   a wide variety of organic molecules, clusters, and oligomers within a
   few tenths of an electron-volt relative to experiment, which is
   comparable to the predictive performance of many-body perturbation
   theory methods at a fraction of the computational cost.}},

Title = {{Semiblind frequency-domain timing synchronization and channel estimation
   for OFDM systems}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{In this article, we propose unit vectors in the high dimensional
   Cartesian coordinate system as the preamble, and then propose a
   semiblind timing synchronization and channel estimation scheme for
   orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. Due to the
   lack of useful information in the time-domain, a frequency-domain timing
   synchronization algorithm is proposed. The proposed semiblind approach
   consists of three stages. In the first stage, a coarse timing offset
   related to the delayed timing of the path with the maximum gain in
   multipath fading channels is obtained. Then, a fine time adjustment
   algorithm is performed to find the actual delayed timing in channels.
   Finally, the channel response in the frequency-domain is obtained based
   on the final timing estimate. Although the required number of additions
   in the proposed algorithm is higher than those in conventional methods,
   the simulation results show that the proposed approach has excellent
   performance of timing synchronization in several channel models at
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) smaller than 6 dB. In addition, for a
   low-density parity-check coded single-input single-output OFDM system,
   our proposed approach has better bit-error-rate performance than
   conventional approaches for SNR varying from 3 to 8 dB.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C}},

Volume = {{1}},

Pages = {{1080-1086}},
Abstract = {{Described is the formulation for a repositionable pressure-sensitive
   adhesive (PSA) capable of reversibly switching between opaque and
   transparent via a thermal trigger. The smart adhesive is generated by
   casting films from a solution of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), its
   organometallic crosslinker and a paraffin wax/dodecane solution on
   poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) sheets. Once cured, the PDMS/paraffin
   wax composite films demonstrate characteristics consistent with
   commercial repositionable PSAs. Properties were found to be dependent on
   the paraffin wax content and degree of crosslinking in the PDMS.
   Performance of the developed adhesive films is highly stable remaining
   unchanged subsequent to extended use and repeated repositioning. The
   appearance of the films can be switched between opaque at room
   temperature to transparent for temperatures above 53 degrees C. The
   change in optical properties is nearly instantaneous and there appears
   to be no limitation on how many times the cycle can be repeated. The
   mechanism involved is unique involving the melting of the paraffin wax,
   which appears to allow for the formation of a more homogeneous composite
   structure. This adhesive formulation may be well suited for use as a
   low-cost, convenient smart window coating.}},

Abstract = {{It is known that distraction reduces the benefits of collision avoidance
   systems by slowing a driver's response. The current study examined the
   impact of a drivers' use of an in-vehicle intersection crossing assist
   system under demanding cognitive load conditions. Forty eight drivers
   crossed a busy rural intersection in a simulated environment while
   completing four blocks of trials, in half of which they used the assist
   system and engaged in a working memory task. Participants were
   dichotomized into older and younger age groups. The results showed a
   tendency towards conservative driving in a single-task condition when
   only using the assist system. A similar shift in driving style was
   observed when drivers crossed the intersection while engaged in a
   secondary task. Using the in-vehicle intersection crossing assist system
   under cognitively demanding conditions did not result in adverse
   consequences the impact of distraction was different compared to a
   typical collision avoidance system. Older drivers showed some evidence
   of more conservative intersection crossing, however they also appeared
   to rely more on the in-vehicle assist system when presented with an
   extraneous additional task. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Microfluidic chemostat for measuring single cell dynamics in bacteria}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{947-954}},
Abstract = {{We designed a microfluidic chemostat consisting of 600 sub-micron
   trapping/growth channels connected to two feeding channels. The
   microchemostat traps E. coli cells and forces them to grow in lines for
   over 50 generations. Excess cells, including the mother cells captured
   at the start of the process, are removed from both ends of the growth
   channels by the media flow. With the aid of time-lapse microscopy, we
   have monitored dynamic properties such as growth rate and GFP expression
   at the single-cell level for many generations while maintaining a
   population of bacteria of similar age. We also use the microchemostat to
   show how the population responds to dynamic changes in the environment.
   Since more than 100 individual bacterial cells are aligned and
   immobilized in a single field of view, the microchemostat is an ideal
   platform for high-throughput intracellular measurements. We demonstrate
   this capability by tracking with sub-diffraction resolution the
   movements of fluorescently tagged loci in more than one thousand cells
   on a single device. The device yields results comparable to conventional
   agar microscopy experiments with substantial increases in throughput and
   ease of analysis.}},

Title = {{A Coupled Fiber-Matrix Model Demonstrates Highly Inhomogeneous
   Microstructural Interactions in Soft Tissues Under Tensile Load}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A soft tissue's macroscopic behavior is largely determined by its
   microstructural components (often a collagen fiber network surrounded by
   a nonfibrillar matrix (NFM)). In the present study, a coupled
   fiber-matrix model was developed to fully quantify the internal stress
   field within such a tissue and to explore interactions between the
   collagen fiber network and nonfibrillar matrix (NFM). Voronoi
   tessellations (representing collagen networks) were embedded in a
   continuous three-dimensional NFM. Fibers were represented as
   one-dimensional nonlinear springs and the NFM, meshed via tetrahedra,
   was modeled as a compressible neo-Hookean solid. Multidimensional finite
   element modeling was employed in order to couple the two tissue
   components and uniaxial tension was applied to the composite
   representative volume element (RVE). In terms of the overall RVE
   response (average stress, fiber orientation, and Poisson's ratio), the
   coupled fiber-matrix model yielded results consistent with those
   obtained using a previously developed parallel model based upon
   superposition. The detailed stress field in the composite RVE
   demonstrated the high degree of inhomogeneity in NFM mechanics, which
   cannot be addressed by a parallel model. Distributions of
   maximum/minimum principal stresses in the NFM showed a transition from
   fiber-dominated to matrix-dominated behavior as the matrix shear modulus
   increased. The matrix-dominated behavior also included a shift in the
   fiber kinematics toward the affine limit. We conclude that if only gross
   averaged parameters are of interest, parallel-type models are suitable.
   If, however, one is concerned with phenomena, such as individual
   cell-fiber interactions or tissue failure that could be altered by local
   variations in the stress field, then the detailed model is necessary in
   spite of its higher computational cost. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4023136]}},

   media-sharing communities}},
Journal = {{KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{438-450}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{With the proliferation of online communities, the deployment of
   knowledge, skills, experiences and user generated content are generally
   facilitated among participant users. In online social media-sharing
   communities, the success of social interactions for content sharing and
   dissemination among completely unknown users depends on `trust'.
   Therefore, providing a satisfactory trust model to evaluate the quality
   of content and to recommend personalized trustworthy content providers
   is vital for a successful online social media-sharing community. Current
   research on trust prediction strongly relies on a web of trust, which is
   directly collected from users. However, the web of trust is not always
   available in online communities and, even when it is available, it is
   often too sparse to accurately predict the trust value between two
   unacquainted people. Moreover, most of the extant trust research studies
   have not paid attention to the importance of distrust, even though
   distrust is a distinct concept from trust with different impacts on
   behavior. In this paper, we adopt the concepts of `trust', `distrust',
   and `lack of confidence' in social relationships and propose a novel
   unifying framework to predict trust and distrust as well as to
   distinguish the confidently-made decisions (trust or distrust) from lack
   of confidence without a web of trust. This approach uses interaction
   histories among users including rating data that is available and much
   denser than explicit trust/distrust statements (i.e. a web of trust).

Abstract = {{Over the last few decades, Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs) have emerged
   as a material system offering tremendous potential for future
   applications. The primary advantages offered by these materials are
   their improved mechanical properties, particularly in the areas of wear,
   strength and stiffness. Of the MMCs, Aluminum matrix composites have
   grown in prominence due to their low density, low melting point and low
   cost. However, machining these materials remains a challenging task
   mainly due to the high abrasiveness of the reinforcing phases.
   Conventional machining processes such as turning, milling or drilling
   are adopted for machining MMCs. In this article, the existing and
   ongoing developments in machining MMCs vis-a-vis tool life, tool wear,
   machinability and understanding chip formation mechanism have been
   highlighted. Most of the studies discussed in this review will focus on
   Aluminum matrix composites. Certain areas of machining studies which

Journal = {{THIN SOLID FILMS}},

Abstract = {{The conduction mechanism of organically passivated silicon quantum dots
   (SiQDs) embedded in Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) has been
   investigated. This architecture forces the charge carriers onto the QDs,
   eliminating the need for charge transfer between the host matrix PMMA
   and the SiQDs. Octene was determined to be the shortest aliphatic ligand
   for electroluminescent films, as mixtures of 5: 1 SiQDs: PMMA were
   readily synthesized without precipitation. At low fields, the current is
   limited by space charge effects with a weak temperature dependence which
   is believed to be due to the quantum dot size distribution. The lack of
   a temperature dependence on the current-voltage characteristics in the
   high voltage regime suggests that trap assisted tunneling is the primary
   conduction mechanism rather than transport through the PMMA. An analysis
   of the results suggests that the tunneling effective mass in PMMA is
   approximately 0.23m(o). Thus, preparing SiQDs in a PMMA matrix may yield
   a recombination pathway for generated excitons allowing for the creation
   of efficient light emitting devices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{15-41}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A Gaussian approximation of the stochastic traffic flow model of Jabari
   and Liu (2012) is proposed. The Gaussian approximation is characterized
   by deterministic mean and covariance dynamics; the mean dynamics are
   those of the Godunov scheme. By deriving the Gaussian model, as opposed
   to assuming Gaussian noise arbitrarily, covariance matrices of traffic
   variables follow from the physics of traffic flow and can be computed
   using only few parameters, regardless of system size or how finely the
   system is discretized. Stationary behavior of the covariance dynamics is
   analyzed and it is shown that the covariance matrices are bounded.
   Consequently, Kalman filters that use the proposed model are
   stochastically observable, which is a critical issue in real time
   estimation of traffic dynamics. Model validation was carried out in a
   real-world signalized arterial setting, where cycle-by-cycle maximum
   queue sizes were estimated using the Gaussian model as a description of
   state dynamics. The estimated queue sizes were compared to observed
   maximum queue sizes and the results indicate very good agreement between
   estimated and observed queue sizes. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We study how two self-interested agents that play a sequence of randomly
   generated normal form games, each game played once, can achieve
   cooperation without being exploited. The agent learns if the opponent is
   willing to cooperate by tracking the attitude of its opponent, which
   tells how much the opponent values its own payoff relative to the
   agent's payoff. We present experimental results obtained against
   different types of non-stationary opponents. The results show that a
   small number of games is sufficient to achieve cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the deadliest solid cancers and
   is the third leading cause of cancer-related death. There is a universal
   estimated male/female ratio of 2.5, but the reason for this is not well
   understood. The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system was used to
   elucidate candidate oncogenic drivers of HCC in a forward genetics
   screening approach. Sex bias occurrence was conserved in our model, with
   male experimental mice developing liver tumors at reduced latency and
   higher tumor penetrance. In parallel, we explored sex differences
   regarding genomic aberrations in 235 HCC patients. Liver cancer
   candidate genes were identified from both sexes and genotypes.
   Interestingly, transposon insertions in the epidermal growth factor
   receptor (Egfr) gene were common in SB-induced liver tumors from male
   mice (10/10, 100\%) but infrequent in female mice (2/9, 22\%). Human
   single-nucleotide polymorphism data confirmed that polysomy of
   chromosome 7, locus of EGFR, was more frequent in males (26/62, 41\%)
   than females (2/27, 7\%) (P = 0.001). Gene expressionbased Poly7
   subclass patients were predominantly male (9/9) compared with 67\% males
   (55/82) in other HCC subclasses (P = 0.02), and this subclass was
   accompanied by EGFR overexpression (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Sex bias
   occurrence of HCC associated with EGFR was confirmed in experimental
   animals using the SB transposon system in a reverse genetic approach.
   This study provides evidence for the role of EGFR in sex bias
   occurrences of liver cancer and as the driver mutational gene in the
   Poly7 molecular subclass of human HCC. (HEPATOLOGY 2013;57:120-130)}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{7-22}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to develop an alternative
   numerical approach for describing fractional diffusion in Cartesian and
   non-Cartesian domains using a Monte Carlo random walk scheme. The
   resulting domain shifting scheme provides a numerical solution for
   multi-dimensional steady state, source free diffusion problems with
   fluxes expressed in terms of Caputo fractional derivatives. This class
   of problems takes account of non-locality in transport, expressed
   through parameters representing both the extent and direction of the
   non-locality.
   Design/methodology/approach - The method described here follows a
   similar approach to random walk methods previously developed for normal
   (local) diffusion. The key differences from standard methods are: first,
   the random shifting of the domain about the point of interest with,
   second, shift steps selected from non-symmetric, power-law tailed, Levy
   probability distribution functions.
   Findings - The domain shifting scheme is verified by comparing
   predictive solutions to known one-dimensional and two-dimensional
   analytical solutions for fractional diffusion problems. The scheme is
   also applied to a problem of fractional diffusion in a non-Cartesian
   annulus domain. In contrast to the axisymmetric, steady state solution
   for normal diffusion, a non-axisymmetric solution results.
   Originality/value - This is the first random walk scheme to utilize the
   concept of allowing the domain to undergo the random walk about a point
   of interest. Domain shifting scheme solutions of fractional diffusion in
   non-Cartesian domains provide an invaluable tool to direct the
   development of more sophisticated grid based finite element inspired
   fractional diffusion schemes.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of the dual aromatic- and olefin-based catalytic cycles in
   methanol-to-hydrocarbons (MTH) catalysis on acid zeolites has given a
   new context for rationalizing structure function relationships for this
   complex chemistry. This perspective examines six major chemistries
   involved in the hydrocarbon pool mechanism for MTH-olefin methylation,
   olefin cracking, hydrogen transfer, cyclization, aromatic methylation,
   and aromatic dealkylation-with a focus on what is known about the rate
   and mechanism of these chemistries. The current mechanistic
   understanding of MTH limits structure function relationships to the
   effect of the zeolite framework on the identity of the hydrocarbon pool
   and the resulting product selectivity. We emphasize the need for
   assessing the consequences of zeolite structure in MTH in terms of
   experimentally measured rates and activation barriers for individual
   reaction steps and in terms of speciation preferences within the dual
   olefin-and aromatic-catalytic cycles to alter their relative
   propagation. In the absence of individual reaction rates, we propose
   using ethene/isobutane selectivity as a measure to describe the relative
   rates of propagation for the aromatic- and olefin-based cycles.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of continuous aggregate
   nearest-neighbor (CANN) queries for moving objects in spatio-temporal
   data stream management systems. A CANN query specifies a set of
   landmarks, an integer k, and an aggregate distance function f (e.g.,
   min, max, or sum), where f computes the aggregate distance between a
   moving object and each of the landmarks. The answer to this continuous
   query is the set of k moving objects that have the smallest aggregate
   distance f. A CANN query may also be viewed as a combined set of nearest
   neighbor queries. We introduce several algorithms to continuously and
   incrementally answer CANN queries. Extensive experimentation shows that
   the proposed operators outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms by up
   to a factor of 3 and incur low memory overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) are
   persistent organic pollutants that have been found to be ubiquitous in
   the environment. This article, for the first time, delineates removal
   areas of these polar compounds on a coagulation diagram that associates
   chemical conditions with different coagulation mechanisms. Variables
   considered were solution pH, coagulant dosage, coagulants (alum and
   ferric chloride), natural organic matter (NOM), initial turbidity, and
   flocculation time.
   The jar-test results show that conventional coagulation (alum dosage of
   10-60 mg/L and final pH of 6.5-8.0) removed <= 20\% of PFOS and PFOA.
   These chemicals tended to be removed better by enhanced coagulation at
   higher coagulant dosages (>60 mg/L) and (thus) lower final pH (4.5-6.5).
   A coagulation diagram was developed to define the coagulant dosage and
   solution pH for PFOS/PFOA removal. The results suggest that the primary
   PFOS/PFOA removal mechanism is adsorption to fine Al hydroxide flocs
   freshly formed during the initial stage of coagulation; increasing
   flocculation time from 2 to 90 mm could not further improve PFOS and
   PFOA removals. Furthermore, the effect of NOM on PFOS/PFOA removal by
   coagulation was examined, and possible removal mechanisms were
   discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibacterial compounds are frequently detected in
   the aquatic environment, and photodegradation is expected to play an
   important role in FQ fate in some sunlit surface waters. This study
   investigated the direct aquatic photochemistry of three FQs:
   norfloxacin, ofloxacin, and enrofloxacin. The direct photolysis rate of
   each drug exhibited strong pH dependence when exposed to simulated
   sunlight. For each FQ direct photolysis rates and total light absorbance
   were used to calculate quantum yields for each of three environmentally
   relevant protonation states: a cationic, a zwitterionic, and an anionic
   form. In each case, quantum yields of the species varied significantly.
   The quantum yield for the zwitterionic form was 2-3 times higher than
   that of the anionic form and over an order of magnitude higher than that
   of the cationic form. Antibacterial activity assays were used to
   determine whether the loss of parent FQ due to photolysis led to loss of
   activity. Norfloxacin and ofloxacin photoproducts were found to be
   inactive, whereas enrofloxacin photoproducts were found to retain
   significant activity. These results are important for aiding in
   predictions of the potential impacts of FQs in surface waters. (C) 2012

Title = {{A Causality Approach to Particle Dynamics for Systems}},

Abstract = {{Causality in physics is an old idea which emphasizes the notion that
   there are `causes' and `responses' to those causes; this relationship is
   expressed through a fundamental equation which is supposed to describe
   the evolution of a dynamical system of particles. In a most elementary
   example, one may identify the power input to a system as the `cause' and
   the rate of change of the internal plus kinetic energy of the system as
   representing the `response'. In this case, the balance of one against
   the other is a statement of balance of energy for the dynamical system;
   such balance is often postulated as fundamental in mechanics. It is the
   purpose of this paper to investigate a more fundamental causality based
   approach for describing the dynamics of a system of particles. Forces
   intrinsic and extrinsic to the system are distinguished and an
   evolutionary causality law, which is form-invariant under a change of
   frame, is proposed. We assume, as is common, that intrinsic forces are
   objective under a general change of frame. Extrinsic forces are assumed
   to be objective only under a Galilean (that is, inertial) change of
   frame. This limited objectivity will play a major role in reducing the
   fundamental proposed `law of causality' to what is recognized as the
   classical balance of energy for the system. The concept of mass is not
   introduced as primitive in this work; the existence of `inertial
   constants', each of which associates with a specific particle of the
   system, is a result of the theory. Double and triple binding forces
   between pairs and triples of particles are admitted as fundamental to
   the intrinsic force structure of this theory. The balance of linear
   momentum for the system is derived and a generalized intrinsic force
   action-reaction principle is obtained. The emergence from the causality
   theory of pair- and triple-particle potential functions is discussed and
   these potential functions are shown to be intimately related to the
   internal binding force structure. Moreover, in Theorem 6.1 the
   underlying invariance structure of the theory shows that the double and
   triple binding forces must be separately `moment-balanced' and that this
   gives rise to the balance of moment-of-momentum for the system. Finally,
   a constitutive theory for the binding forces is posited and it is shown
   that the double binding forces are determined by the pair-particle
   potential function and that the triple binding forces are determined by
   the triple-particle potential function.}},

Abstract = {{Resting state functional connectivity studies in fMRI have been used to
   demonstrate that the human brain is organized into inherent functional
   networks in the absence of stimuli. The basis for this activity is based
   on the spontaneous fluctuations observed during rest. In the present
   study, the time series generated from these fluctuations were
   characterized as either being linear or nonlinear based on the Delay
   Vector Variance method, applied through an examination of the local
   predictability of the signal. It was found that the default mode resting
   state network is composed of relatively more linear signals compared to
   the visual, task positive visuospatial, motor, and auditory resting
   state network time series. Also, it was shown that the visual cortex
   resting state network is more nonlinear relative to these aforementioned
   networks. Furthermore, using a histogram map of the nonlinearly
   characterized voxels for all the subjects, the histogram map was able to
   retrieve the peak intensity in four out of six resting state networks.
   Thus, the findings may provide the basis for a novel way to explore
   spontaneous fluctuations in the resting state brain.}},

Abstract = {{Current generation DNA sequencing instruments are moving closer to
   seamlessly sequencing genomes of entire populations as a routine part of
   scientific investigation. However, while significant inroads have been
   made identifying small nucleotide variation and structural variations in
   DNA that impact phenotypes of interest, progress has not been as
   dramatic regarding epigenetic changes and base-level damage to DNA,
   largely due to technological limitations in assaying all known and
   unknown types of modifications at genome scale. Recently,
   single-molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing has been reported to
   identify kinetic variation (KV) events that have been demonstrated to
   reflect epigenetic changes of every known type, providing a path forward
   for detecting base modifications as a routine part of sequencing.
   However, to date no statistical framework has been proposed to enhance
   the power to detect these events while also controlling for
   false-positive events. By modeling enzyme kinetics in the neighborhood
   of an arbitrary location in a genomic region of interest as a
   conditional random field, we provide a statistical framework for
   incorporating kinetic information at a test position of interest as well
   as at neighboring sites that help enhance the power to detect KV events.
   The performance of this and related models is explored, with the
   best-performing model applied to plasmid DNA isolated from Escherichia
   coli and mitochondrial DNA isolated from human brain tissue. We
   highlight widespread kinetic variation events, some of which strongly
   associate with known modification events, while others represent
   putative chemically modified sites of unknown types.}},

Abstract = {{We show the fundamental passive decomposition property of general
   mechanical systems on a n-dim. configuration manifold M, i.e., when
   endowed with a submersion h : M -> N, where N is a m-dim. manifold (m <=
   n), their Lagrangian dynamics with the kinetic energy as the Lagrangian
   can always be decomposed into: 1) shape system, describing the m-dim.
   dynamics of h(q) on N; 2) locked system, representing the (n - m)-dim.
   dynamics along the level set of h; and 3) energetically-conservative
   coupling between them. The locked and shape systems also individually
   inherit the Lagrangian structure and passivity of the original dynamics.
   We exhibit and analyze geometric and energetic properties of the passive
   decomposition in a coordinate-free manner. An illustrative example on
   SO(3) is also provided.}},

Abstract = {{In nature, microscale hair-like projections called cilia are used
   ubiquitously for both sensing and motility. In this paper, biomimetic
   nanoscale cilia arrays have been fabricated through templated growth of
   Co in anodized aluminum oxide. The motion of arrays of Co cilia was then
   detected using magnetic sensors. These signals were used to prove the
   feasibility of two types of sensors: flow sensors and vibration sensors.
   The flow sensors were tested in a microfluidic channel. They showed the
   ability to detect flows from 0.5 ml/min to 6 ml/min with a signal to
   noise (SNR) of 44 using only 140 mu W of power and no amplification. The
   vibration sensors were tested using a shake table in the low
   earthquake-like frequency range of 1-5 Hz. The vibration response was a
   mW signal at twice the frequency of the shake table.}},

   interfacial coupling between Fe/Co and their oxides. The property of the

Abstract = {{A detection scheme for both Brownian and Neel relaxation of magnetic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) is demonstrated by a mixing-frequency method in
   this paper. MNPs are driven into the saturation region by a
   low-frequency sinusoidal magnetic field. A high-frequency sinusoidal
   magnetic field is then applied to generate mixing-frequency signals that
   are highly specific to the Brownian relaxation of MNPs. These highly
   sensitive mixing-frequency signals from MNPs are picked up by a pair of
   balanced built-in detection coils. The relationship between MNPs'
   relaxation time and phase delays of the mixing-frequency signals behind
   the applied field is derived, and is experimentally verified. Magnetite
   MNPs with the core diameter of 35 nm are used for the measurement of
   Brownian relaxation, and Magnetite MNPs with the core diameter of 12 nm
   are used for the measurement of Neel relaxation. The results show that
   both Brownian and Neel relaxation depend on the magnetic offset field.
   This study provides an in-depth understanding of the relaxation
   mechanisms of MNPs.}},

Abstract = {{This work supports new gas turbine designs for improved performance by
   evaluating the use of endwall contouring in a cascade that is
   representative of a first stage stator passage. Contouring accelerates
   the flow, reducing the thickness of the endwall inlet boundary layer to
   the turbine stage and reducing the strength of secondary flows within
   the passage. The reduction in secondary flows leads to less mixing in
   the endwall region. This allows for an improved cooling of the endwall
   and airfoil surfaces with injected and leakage flows. The present paper
   documents the component misalignment and injected and leakage flow
   effects on the aerodynamic losses within a passage that has one
   contoured and one straight endwall. Steps and injected flows within the
   passage can lead to thicker endwall boundary layers, stronger secondary
   flows, and possibly additional vortex structures in the passage. The
   paper compares losses with various steps, gaps, and leakage flows to
   assess their importance in this contoured passage. In particular,
   features associated with the combustor-to-turbine transition piece and
   the slashface on the vane platform are addressed. An n-factorial study
   is used to quantify the importance of such effects on aerodynamic
   losses. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006419]}},

   take a very forward-looking stance and fail to provide a complete
   perspective on the current landscape. This article provides a more
   comprehensive and contemporary inventory of nanomedicine products. A
   keyword search of literature, clinical trial registries, and the Web
   yielded 247 nanomedicine products that are approved or in various stages
   of clinical study. Specific information on each was gathered, so the
   overall field could be described based on various dimensions, including
   FDA classification, approval status, nanoscale size, treated condition,
   nanostructure, and others. In addition to documenting the many
   nanomedicine products already in use in humans, this study indentifies
   several interesting trends forecasting the future of nanomedicine. From
   the Clinical Editor: In this one of a kind review, the state of
   nanomedicine commercialization is discussed, concentrating only on
   nanomedicine-based developments and products that are either in clinical
   trials or have already been approved for use. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

   a resource for biologists interested in engineering ZFAs for use as
   sequence-specific DNA-binding reagents. Here, we describe four new
   features of ZiFDB: (i) the database allows users to input new ZFs and
   ZFAs; (ii) a shadow database temporarily stores user-submitted data,
   pending approval by the database curator and subsequent loading into the
   persistent database; (iii) ZiFDB contains 181 Context-Dependent Assembly
   (CoDA) ZFAs, which were generated by this newly described ZFA
   engineering platform; and (iv) the database also now contains 319 F1F2
   CoDA units and 334 F2F3 CoDA units that can be used to construct CoDA

Abstract = {{The ability to precisely engineer plant genomes offers much potential
   for advancing basic and applied plant biology. Here, we describe methods
   for the targeted modification of plant genomes using transcription
   activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). Methods were optimized using
   tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) protoplasts and TALENs targeting the
   acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene. Optimal TALEN scaffolds were
   identified using a protoplast-based single-strand annealing assay in
   which TALEN cleavage creates a functional yellow fluorescent protein
   gene, enabling quantification of TALEN activity by flow cytometry.
   Single-strand annealing activity data for TALENs with different
   scaffolds correlated highly with their activity at endogenous targets,
   as measured by high-throughput DNA sequencing of polymerase chain
   reaction products encompassing the TALEN recognition sites. TALENs
   introduced targeted mutations in ALS in 30\% of transformed cells, and
   the frequencies of targeted gene insertion approximated 14\%. These
   efficiencies made it possible to recover genome modifications without
   selection or enrichment regimes: 32\% of tobacco calli generated from
   protoplasts transformed with TALEN-encoding constructs had TALEN-induced
   mutations in ALS, and of 16 calli characterized in detail, all had
   mutations in one allele each of the duplicate ALS genes (SurA and SurB).
   In calli derived from cells treated with a TALEN and a 322-bp donor
   molecule differing by 6 bp from the ALS coding sequence, 4\% showed
   evidence of targeted gene replacement. The optimized reagents
   implemented in plant protoplasts should be useful for targeted
   modification of cells from diverse plant species and using a variety of
   means for reagent delivery.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a self-sensing carbon nanotube (CNT) concrete pavement
   system for traffic detection is proposed and tested in a roadway.
   Pre-cast and cast-in-place self-sensing CNT concrete sensors were
   simultaneously integrated into a controlled pavement test section at the
   Minnesota Road Research Facility (MnROAD), USA. Road tests of the system
   were conducted by using an MnROAD five-axle semi-trailer tractor truck
   and a van, respectively, both in the winter and summer. Test results
   show that the proposed self-sensing pavement system can accurately
   detect the passing of different vehicles under different vehicular
   speeds and test environments. These findings indicate that the developed
   self-sensing CNT concrete pavement system can achieve real-time vehicle
   flow detection with a high detection rate and a low false-alarm rate.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticle (mNP) based thermal therapies have demonstrated
   relevance in the clinic, but effective application requires an
   understanding of both its strengths and limitations. This study explores
   two critical limitations for clinical use: (1) maximizing localized mNP
   heating, while avoiding bulk heating due to inductive coupling of the
   applied field with the body and (2) the limits of treatable volumes,
   related to basic heat transfer. Two commercially available mNPs are
   investigated, one superparamagnetic and one ferromagnetic, thereby
   allowing a comparison between the two fundamental types of mNPs (both of
   which are being evaluated for clinical use). Important results indicate
   that in dispersed solutions, the superparamagnetic mNPs outperform on a
   per mass basis (2x better), but the ferromagnetic mNPs outperform on a
   per nanoparticle basis (170x better), at the fields of highest clinical
   relevance (approximately 100 kHz and 20 kA/m). We also demonstrate a new
   method of observing heating in microliter droplets of mNP solution,
   leading to scaling analyses that suggest treatable tumor volumes should
   be a parts per thousand yen2 mm in diameter (for mNP loading of a parts
   per thousand yen10 mg Fe/g tumor), to achieve therapeutic temperatures a
   parts per thousand yen43 A degrees C. This technique also provides a
   novel platform for quantifying heating from microgram quantities of
   mNPs.}},

Abstract = {{Much attention has been directed toward improving nonviral gene delivery
   in order to replace viral vectors and overcome the barriers to clinical
   gene therapy. Specifically targeting nonviral gene delivery vehicles to
   the disease tissue can significantly improve their delivery efficiency.
   Targeting peptides have been developed for growth factor receptors,
   integrins and tumor vasculature to target cancer, neurotrophin or
   neurotoxin receptors aiming to give specificity for neurodegenerative
   disease, airway epithelial cells to target cystic fibrosis and other
   tissue specific cells and receptors in bone tissue, cornea and dendritic
   cells. These highly specific, high-affinity peptides were identified
   using phage display or through rational design, and were evaluated
   within this review for their potential and ability to improve
   transfection, highlighting the successful applications of this
   technology and discussing the features of the design that contribute to
   this success. It was found that effective peptide targeting of gene
   delivery relied both on peptide ligand performance and on nonviral
   vectors that exploit the appropriate intracellular trafficking
   mechanisms.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{166-173}},
Abstract = {{Well defined mu-A(BC)(n) `miktobrush' terpolymers were synthesized
   utilizing the alternating radical copolymerization of two hydrophobic
   and incompatible macromonomer (MM) building blocks; a maleimide (MI) end
   functionalized poly(methyl-caprolactone) block (MI-PMCL) or `C' and a
   styrene (Sty) end functionalized poly(perfluoro propylene oxide) block
   (Sty-PFPO) or `F'. Polymerizations were mediated by a poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PEO) functionalized reversible addition-fragmentation chain
   transfer (RAFT) agent (PEO-CTA) or `O' to control the chain growth of
   the MMs from the O block to form O(CF)(n) ``miktobrush{''} terpolymers.
   The synthesis of a range of well defined mu-O(CF)(n) terpolymers with
   various compositions was achieved by changing the feed of MMs. All
   building blocks and brush polymers were characterized by nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, size exclusion chromatography
   (SEC) and elemental analyses. This new strategy offers a powerful route
   towards a block polymer architecture that can enable the formation of
   multi-domain hierarchical nanostructures with features on multiple
   length scales due to the incompatibility and unique connectivity of the
   building blocks incorporated.}},

Abstract = {{Model-based fault detection methods have the potential to reduce the
   size, weight, and cost of safety-critical aerospace systems. One
   obstacle to the application of these methods is a lack of appropriate
   tools to efficiently certify their reliability. This paper focuses on
   the false alarm analysis of a general fault detection scheme. The main
   difficulty of the false alarm analysis is the time-correlations
   introduced by the plant dynamics and the fault detection filter. This
   paper proves product-type probability inequalities for general
   stationary zero-mean Gaussian processes. These inequalities are applied
   to provide converging bounds for the false alarm probability over a
   given time window. A numerical example is presented to demonstrate the
   proposed technique.}},

Abstract = {{The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem is nonconvex and, for generic
   network structures, is NP-hard. A recent flurry of work has explored the
   use of semidefinite relaxations to solve the OPF problem. For general
   network structures, however, this approach may fail to yield solutions
   that are physically meaningful, in the sense that they are high rank
   -precluding their efficient mapping back to the original feasible set.
   In certain cases, however, there may exist a hidden rank-one optimal
   solution. In this paper an iterative linearization-minimization
   algorithm is proposed to uncover rank-one solutions for the relaxation.
   The iterates are shown to converge to a stationary point. A simple
   bisection method is also proposed to address problems for which the
   linearization-minimization procedure fails to yield a rank-one optimal
   solution. The algorithms are tested on representative power system
   examples. In many cases, the linearization-minimization procedure
   obtains a rank-one optimal solution where the naive semidefinite
   relaxation fails. Furthermore, a 14-bus example is provided for which
   the linearization-minimization algorithm achieves a rank-one solution
   with a cost strictly lower than that obtained by a conventional solver.
   We close by discussing some rank monotonicity properties of the proposed
   methodology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper summarizes a suite of methods that have recently been
   proposed for the control and synchronization of parallel single-and
   three-phase voltage source power electronics inverters. Inspired by the
   phenomenon of synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators, the
   premise of the proposed Virtual Oscillator Control (VOC) is to control
   an inverter such that it mimics the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator.
   Consequently, the inverters synchronize their voltage outputs and share
   the load power in proportion to their power ratings without any
   communication. The VOC design philosophy and sufficient conditions for
   global asymptotic synchronization are outlined. Simulations validate the
   analytical results for a parallel system of three-phase inverters
   serving a constant-power load.}},

Abstract = {{During the summer of 2012, the Electrical Engineering department at the
   University of Minnesota Duluth offered a summer camp for seventh-grade
   students to attempt to interest them in engineering. Among the topics
   included in this one-week summer camp was a one-day exposure to digital
   circuit design. How does one teach digital circuit design in one day to
   students who are in the midst of summer vacation and who have no
   technical background? What are the vital basics? What is unnecessary
   confusion? How can seventh-graders be entertained while still inspiring
   them to consider engineering concepts? These questions were among those
   faced by the Electrical Engineering faculty. This paper exposes some of
   the techniques used to intrigue students and to capture their interest
   in digital circuit design.
   Attracting middle-school students to the field of engineering is a
   challenge. Students' interest must be captured before societal pressures
   deflect career choices into other directions. Students, must be
   encouraged to consider engineering as an interesting field before it is
   ``too late{''} to enter the necessary math and science tracks in high
   school. Consequently, students must be exposed to the excitement and
   potential of engineering during their middle-school education to
   motivate them successfully to consider engineering careers. The goal of
   the summer camp was to dazzle students with fun applications that
   engineering makes possible, without intimidating them with undue
   complexity or technical details.
   Topics presented to these seventh-graders during their one-day exposure
   to digital circuit design included both combinational and sequential
   circuits, although only in very restricted arenas. Only two different
   types of digital components were described, NAND gates and D-flip-flops.
   A seven-segment LED display digit was used to show the output produced
   by student circuits because these students were familiar with such
   displays from their everyday life. Students performed a variety of
   experiments from simply making a light flash to creating custom patterns
   on the seven-segment display, with a wide range of success. Overall,
   students seemed to enjoy the experience.
   This paper describes the topics presented to these middle-school
   students in digital circuit design, and details some ``lab
   experiments{''} performed to provide hands-on experience. Also included
   are lessons learned by the Electrical Engineering faculty to improve
   future camp offerings.}},

   the new curriculum and facilitated classroom discourse. It shows that
   the model has empowered instructors to turn classroom interactions and

   Stochastic modules based on finite state machines (FSMs) have been shown

Abstract = {{We study the inverse problem of reproducing partially known second-order
   statistics of a linear time invariant system by the least number of
   possible input disturbance channels. This can be formulated as a rank
   minimization problem, and for its solution, we employ a convex
   relaxation based on the nuclear norm. The resulting optimization problem
   can be cast as a semi-definite program and solved efficiently using
   general-purpose solvers for small- and medium-size problems. In this
   paper, we focus on issues and techniques that are pertinent to
   large-scale systems. We bring in a re-parameterization which transforms
   the problem into a form suitable for the alternating direction method of
   multipliers. Furthermore, we show that each iteration of this algorithm
   amounts to solving a system of linear equations, an eigenvalue
   decomposition, and a singular value thresholding. An illustrative
   example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in compressive sensing (CS) have established that
   high-dimensional signals that possess sparse representations in some
   basis or dictionary can be accurately recovered from relatively few
   linear measurements. As a result, CS strategies have been proposed and
   developed in a number of application domains where sensing resource
   efficiency is of primary importance. This paper examines a class of
   compressive anomaly detection tasks, where the aim is to identify the
   locations of a nominally small number of outliers in a large collection
   of data (which may be scalar or multivariate) using a small number of
   observations of the form of linear combinations of subsets of the data.
   We introduce a generalized notion of sparsity termed here as saliency,
   and establish that a novel sensing and inference technique called
   Compressive Saliency Sensing (CSS), comprised of a randomized linear
   sensing strategy and associated computationally efficient inference
   procedure based on techniques from group testing, can accurately
   identify the locations of k outliers in a collection of n items from
   only m = O(k log n) linear measurements. We describe several inference
   tasks to which our approach is suited, including ``traditional{''}
   k-sparse support recovery problems; identification of k outliers in the
   ``simple{''} signal model of Donoho and Tanner, characterized by
   nominally binary vectors having k entries strictly in (0, 1); and
   identification of vectors that are outliers from a common
   (low-dimensional) linear subspace.}},

Abstract = {{Social interactions preceding and succeeding trust formation can be
   significant indicators of formation of trust in online social networks.
   In this research we analyze the social interaction trends that lead and
   follow formation of trust in these networks. This enables us to
   hypothesize novel theories responsible for explaining formation of trust
   in online social settings and provide key insights. We find that a
   certain level of socialization threshold needs to be met in order for
   trust to develop between two individuals. This threshold differs across
   persons and across networks. Once the trust relation has developed
   between a pair of characters connected by some social relation (also
   referred to as a character dyad), trust can be maintained with a lower
   rate of socialization.
   Our first set of experiments is the relationship prediction problem. We
   predict the emergence of a social relationship like grouping, mentoring
   and trading between two individuals over a period of time by looking at
   the past characteristics of the network. We find that features related
   to trust have very little impact on this prediction. In the final set of
   experiments, we predict the formation of trust between individuals by
   looking at the topographical and semantic social interaction features
   between them. We generate three semantic dimensions for this task which
   can be recomputed with an observed social variable (say grouping) to
   create a new semantic social variable. In this endeavor, we successfully
   show that, including features related to socialization, gives us an
   approximate increase of 4-9\% accuracy for trust relationship
   predictions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent breakthrough results in compressive sensing (CS) have established
   that many high dimensional signals can be accurately recovered from a
   relatively small number of non-adaptive linear observations, provided
   that the signals possess a sparse representation in some basis.
   Subsequent efforts have shown that the performance of CS can be improved
   by exploiting structure in the locations of the nonzero signal
   coefficients during inference, or by utilizing some form of
   data-dependent adaptive measurement scheme during the sensing process.
   Our previous work established that an adaptive sensing strategy
   specifically tailored to signals that are tree-sparse can significantly
   outperform adaptive and non-adaptive sensing strategies that are
   agnostic to the underlying structure in noisy support recovery tasks. In
   this paper we establish corresponding fundamental performance limits for
   these support recovery tasks, in settings where measurements may be
   obtained either non-adaptively (using a randomized Gaussian measurement
   strategy motivated by initial CS investigations) or by any adaptive
   sensing strategy. Our main results here imply that the adaptive tree
   sensing procedure analyzed in our previous work is nearly optimal, in
   the sense that no other sensing and estimation strategy can perform
   fundamentally better for identifying the support of tree-sparse signals.}},

   MOLAR, a flash-aware I/O path structure is designed to adapt the

   proposed to wisely select the evicted data blocks from DRAM to reside in
   SSD. Besides, for SSD can improve internal data placement from data
   access hints, the Logical Block Addresses (LBAs) in SSD are grouped into
   the long-lived region and the short-lived region self-adaptively via a
   heuristic control algorithm based on the change of data block demotion
   count. Through trace-driven simulations, the overall hit ratio in MOLAR
   outperforms two traditional policies from 1.44\% to 5.34\%. The average
   write latency in SSD is reduced by 3.5 X. Moreover, write amplification
   is effectively reduced by about 36\% in two typical flash address

Abstract = {{Flashing ratchet is a mechanism which employs noise under isothermal and
   non equilibrium conditions. Its primary is to transport of small
   particles, possibly against a load force, under the influence of thermal
   noise and potential energy landscapes that can be realized locally, near
   the particles position. In this article we present a dynamic programming
   based approach to analyze and synthesize optimal strategies in the
   presence of a non-zero load force and finite sampling intervals. We show
   that it is possible to obtain an order increase in velocity and stalling
   force, over open-loop strategies. Besides engineered systems, study of
   such strategy is also important to gain insights on the intra-cellular
   transport of motor proteins (such as Kinesin and Dynein) on a
   microtubular track, and on the role of feedback control on their
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have seen a large volume of proposals on managing the
   shared last-level cache (LLC) of chip-multiprocessors (CMPs). However,
   most of these proposals primarily focus on reducing the amount of
   destructive interference between competing independent threads of
   multi-programmed workloads. While very few of these studies evaluate the
   proposed policies on shared memory multi-threaded applications, they do
   not improve constructive cross-thread sharing of data in the LLC In this
   paper, we characterize a set of multi-threaded applications drawn from
   the PARSEC, SPEC OMP, and SPLASH-2 suites with the goal of introducing
   sharing-awareness in LLC replacement policies. We motivate our
   characterization study by quantifying the potential contributions of the
   shared and the private blocks toward the overall volume of the LLC hits
   in these applications and show that the shared blocks are more important
   than the private blocks. Next, we characterize the amount of
   sharing-awareness enjoyed by recent proposals compared to the optimal
   policy. We design and evaluate a generic oracle that can be used in
   conjunction with any existing policy to quantify the potential
   improvement that can come from introducing sharing-awareness. The oracle
   analysis shows that introducing sharing-awareness reduces the number of
   LLC misses incurred by the least-recently-used (LRU) policy by 6\% and
   10\% on average for a 4MB and 8MB LLC respectively. A realistic
   implementation of this oracle requires the LLC controller to have the
   capability to accurately predict, at the time a block is filled into the
   LLC, whether the block will be shared during its residency in the LLC.
   We explore the feasibility of designing such a predictor based on the
   address of the fill and the program counter of the instruction that
   triggers the fill. Our sharing behavior predictability study of two
   history-based fill-time predictors that use block addresses and program
   counters concludes that achieving acceptable levels of accuracy with
   such predictors will require other architectural and/or high-level
   program semantic features that have strong correlations with active
   sharing phases of the LLC blocks.}},

Abstract = {{The Radio Frequency (RF) coil is an essential part of hardware in
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) systems and microstrip transmission
   line (TEM) RF coils have been widely used for high-field applications to
   excite and receive the nuclear magnetic resonance signals. These coils
   are typically terminated by capacitors. On one end two variable
   capacitors, the matching capacitor (Cm) and tuning capacitor (Ct), and
   on the other end a fixed value capacitor (Cf) form a capacitively tuned,
   matched, and foreshortened half-wave resonator. These resonant coil
   elements have narrow bandwidth due to their high quality factors (Qs).
   High transmit power efficiency and receive Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
   depend on a well-tuned and matched coil element. Conversely, the
   variable body loading of these coil elements can adversely impact both
   tuning and matching, and therefore power efficiency and SNR of transmit/
   receive signals. Loading effects are problematic and a manual tuning is
   a time-consuming adjustment. It, however, is the only method to avoid
   loading problems at present. This study demonstrates the automatic
   frequency tuning and impedance matching technique for the optimal coil
   efficiency. An 8-channel RF head coil has been successfully built and
   tested with a fully automatic tuning and matching function at 7tesla
   (T). It offers real-time fast operation (less than 550ms per channel)
   and accurate frequency tuning and impedance matching (less than -20dB in
   the reflected coefficient, S11, at the Larmor frequency) resulting in
   the high power efficiency (4\% - 21\% improvement for each channel).}},

Abstract = {{With the development of wireless communications, Vehicular Ad Hoc
   Network (VANET) has received considerable attention on information
   sharing and data delivery services. In order to collect and control
   traffic conditions, Intelligent Transportations Systems (ITS) has
   deployed a number of Road Side Units (RSUs) along the roads to collect
   and deliver traffic information to the Traffic Control Center (TCC) for
   analyzing traffic data. Although some VANET models have been proposed
   based on the predictable routes and schedules of buses, none of them
   considered taking advantage of such traffic infrastructure which already
   been supplied by ITS and combine them with scheduled buses. In this
   paper, we propose a two-tier BUS-VANET that is fully integrated with
   RSUs and TCC as traffic infrastructures. In this new architecture, the
   communications of vehicles, not only benefit from the existence of
   buses, but also consider the effects of using RSUs and TCC. RSUs are
   used to ensure service coverage while TCC is helpful for locating the
   destination vehicle quickly. We also investigate how much benefits can
   be obtained by taking advantage of traffic infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{For the last decade, there have been varying techniques for hardware
   prefetchers to improve the system performance. However, due to limited
   space and bandwidth in a multicore system, the prefetching data fetched
   by prefetcher may pollute L1 cache even though the data is useful, thus
   resulting into significant performance degradation. Most contemporary
   multicore systems simply disable prefetching to avoid unexpected
   contention.
   This paper proposes a cross-layer and dynamic Prefetch Allocation
   Management (PAM) to provide better caching strategies in a parallel
   environment. Our approach has two main mechanisms, targeting at the
   different prefetch degree and location choices to minimize the cache
   pollution and contention. Across a variety of SPLASH2 and PARSEC
   benchmark, our PAM approach can contribute up to 12\% of performance
   improvement on a 4-core multicore system compared to the static
   prefetcher configuration and also saves 9.1\% of the memory bandwidth
   consumption of memory system.}},

Abstract = {{Boundedly rational user equilibria (BRUE) represent traffic flow
   distribution patterns where travellers can take any route whose travel
   cost is within an `indifference band' of the shortest path cost. Those
   traffic flow patterns satisfying the above condition constitute a set,
   named the BRUE solution set. It is important to obtain all the BRUE flow
   patterns, because it can help predict the variation of the link flow
   pattern in a traffic network under the boundedly rational behavior
   assumption. However, the methodology of constructing the BRUE set has
   been lacking in the established literature. This paper fills the gap by
   constructing the BRUE solution set on traffic networks with fixed
   demands connecting multiple OD pairs. According to the definition of the
   epsilon-BRUE, where e is the indifference band for the perceived travel
   cost, we formulate the e-BRUE problem as a nonlinear complementarity
   problem (NCP), so that a BRUE solution can be obtained by solving a
   BRUE-NCP formulation. To obtain the whole BRUE solution set encompassing
   all BRUE flow patterns, we firstly propose a methodology of generating
   various path combinations which may be utilized under the boundedly
   rational behavior assumption. We find out that with the increase of the
   indifference band, the path set that contains boundedly rational
   equilibrium flows will be augmented, and the critical values of
   indifference bands to augment these path sets can be identified by
   solving a family of mathematical programs with equilibrium constraints
   (MPEC) sequentially. After these utilized path sets are attained, the
   BRUE solution set can be obtained when we assign all traffic demands to
   these utilized paths. Various numerical examples are given to illustrate
   our findings. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Time gap, defined as the time difference between the departure of the
   leading vehicle and the arrival of the following at the designated test
   point, is of great importance for both microscopic and macroscopic
   traffic modeling. In this paper, we report our recent investigation on a
   large amount of time gap data. By categorizing time gaps according to
   traffic conditions (indicated by travel speeds) and driving conditions
   (including no-speed-change, acceleration, and deceleration), we first
   studied the uncertainty in drivers' gap selection, which is determined
   by drivers' perception of selecting a comfortable and safe distance to
   the front vehicle. As we found out, under congested conditions, the
   average time gaps selected by drivers display little variation when
   drivers do not accelerate or decelerate; but when drivers are
   accelerating or decelerating, on average, they choose different time
   gaps with different speeds.
   We further studied the impact of the uncertainty of drivers' gap
   selection on the macroscopic traffic variables by considering the road
   traffic as a stochastic process. We derived a shifted Gamma traffic
   count distribution to describe the randomness of traffic flow caused by
   the uncertainty of drivers' gap selection, and then derived the
   fundamental diagram (FD) based on the count distribution. We found out
   that the uncertainty of drivers' gap selection partially contributes to
   the scatter in the FD; and the shape of the FD changes with driving
   conditions: the right-hand-side of the FD most likely is a linear line
   for no-speed-change condition; but it becomes a convex curve when
   vehicles are accelerating and a concave curve when decelerating. The
   different capacity values shown in the FD offer a possible explanation
   for the ``capacity drop{''}. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{CO2 Plume Geothermal (CPG) energy generation is a renewable technology
   that uses CO2 as the geologic working fluid within naturally permeable,
   sedimentary thermal reservoirs. In this paper, we compare the ability
   for CPG geothermal technology to meet electrical demand requirements,
   compared with other renewable technologies, for a 10MW, northern climate
   town near Minot, North Dakota. Wind and solar are both supply-driven
   technologies, capturing energy when it is available; However CPG is
   demand-driven-the rate at which energy is removed from within the earth
   is chosen to meet electrical demand. Using meteorological data, we
   compare estimated system performance with actual 2010 electrical load to
   gage each system's ability to meet demand.
   CPG is found to most closely match system demand during the three-season
   (fall, winter, spring) year, where solar production is inversely related
   to demand. At the same time, wind does not track demand during any
   portion of the year, consistently having a large variability. None of
   these renewable technologies was found to track demand all year.
   Ultimately we show that CPG may be used to reliably track hourly demand
   during 95\% of the year-an unattainable result for wind and solar.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and
   Alzheimer's disease are major public health problems. However, despite
   decades of research, we currently have no validated prognostic or
   diagnostic tests that can be applied at an individual patient level.
   Many neuropsychiatric diseases are due to a combination of alterations
   that occur in a human brain rather than the result of localized lesions.
   While there is hope that newer imaging technologies such as functional
   and anatomic connectivity MRI or molecular imaging may offer
   breakthroughs, the single biomarkers that are discovered using these
   datasets are limited by their inability to capture the heterogeneity and
   complexity of most multifactorial brain disorders. Recently, complex
   biomarkers have been explored to address this limitation using
   neuroimaging data. In this manuscript we consider the nature of complex
   biomarkers being investigated in the recent literature and present
   techniques to find such biomarkers that have been developed in related
   areas of data mining, statistics, machine learning and bioinformatics.

Abstract = {{The effects of metallic and plastic vapors on dielectric breakdown
   strength at atmospheric pressure after current-zero for low-voltage
   circuit breaker (LVCB) applications have been investigated. Dielectric
   breakdown is characterized by a positive value of net ionization
   coefficient, which is the difference between ionization and attachment
   coefficients. In this paper, preliminary results are presented for the
   case where the metallic electrode is composed of copper while the
   ablating plastic wall material is polyamide 6/6 (PA-66). The effects of
   vibrationally-excited diatomic species and electronically-excited
   monatomic species on breakdown strength are also presented. The excited
   species are observed to lower the breakdown strength. It is expected
   that the current approach will provide quantitative comparisons between
   different metallic and plastic vapor combinations observed in realistic
   LVCBs and the numerical results will subsequently be utilized for
   comparisons with available experimental data. This approach is the first
   step towards addressing realistic nonequilibrium conditions prevailing
   in an LVCB after current-zero and the results will be a valuable tool
   for suggesting improvements in dielectric interruption ability of LVCBs.}},

Abstract = {{The Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) has been extensively used to
   characterize the evolution of the probability density function (PDF) of
   sediment particles moving above a gravel bed. This equation describes
   the density of particles at any given point in space and time and its
   derivation is based on the macroscale statistical properties of particle
   movement, e.g. the PDF of hop distances. In this study, we use the
   framework of statistical mechanics to formally connect the motion of
   individual particles to the behavior of the ensemble. Specially, based
   on the forces exerted on a single particle, we derive the nonlinear
   stochastic Langevin equation (LE) to describe the dynamics of a single
   particle, referring to both the deterministic and stochastic components
   of forces. Then, the FPE, which describes the evolution of the PDF of
   the ensemble particle velocities, is derived from the LE. We show that
   the theoretical PDF obtained by solving the FPE under equilibrium
   conditions, has exponential form, consistent with the PDF of the
   simulated particle velocities and that of the experimental data by
   Roseberry et al. (2012). We also simulate the velocity series of
   individual particles from the LE and show an emergent nonlinear
   relationship between hop distances and travel times in agreement with
   observations.}},

Abstract = {{Air, cooling of electronic equipment continues to hold many advantages
   over liquid cooling in terms of simplicity, reliability, cost, etc. Many
   active and passive air cooling techniques have been developed to meet
   the thermal challenges of modern, high-power electronics. Active cooling
   includes such features as piezoelectric flapping fans and synthetic jets
   that could directly break down and thin the thermal boundary layers on
   heated surfaces. A microchannel bank of fins, micro pin-fin surfaces,
   etc. are passive methods for increasing heat transfer area. In the
   current study, both active and passive methods, piezoelectric
   translational agitators and micro pin fin arrays, are employed to
   dramatically enhance convective heat transfer rates. A piezoelectric
   stack actuator coupled with an oval loop shell displacement amplifier
   was utilized to generate high-frequency and large-displacement
   translational agitation over the micro pin fin surface. Two different
   micro pin-fin surfaces were fabricated using copper and the LIGA
   process. Heat transfer experiments were performed in a single channel
   that houses a one-sided, heated surface with attached micro pin fins.
   The piezoelectric translational agitator oscillates at a high frequency
   of 596 Hz with a large displacement of up to 1.8 mm. The heat transfer
   coefficients on the micro pin-fin surface cooled by the agitator and
   various channel through-flows were compared with those of plain surfaces
   under the same channel flow rates. A maximum improvement of 222\% in the
   heat transfer rate was achieved when the agitator was operated, the
   micro pin-fin surface was in place and the channel flow velocity was
   11.6 m/sec, compared to that of a non-agitated plain surface case with
   the same flow rate.}},

Abstract = {{Conventional heat sink systems with blowers or fans are approaching
   maximum thermal management capability due to dramatically increased heat
   dissipation from the chips of high power electronics. In order to
   increase thermal performance of air-cooled heat sink systems, more
   active or passive cooling components are continually being considered.
   One technique is to agitate of the flow in the heat sinks to replace or
   aid conventional blowers. In the present study, an active heat sink
   system that is coupled with a piezoelectric translational agitator and
   micro pin fin arrays on the heat sink surfaces is considered. The
   piezoelectric translational agitator generates high frequency and large
   displacement motion to a blade. It is driven by an oval loop shell that
   amplifies the small displacement of the piezo stack actuator to the
   several-millimeter range. The blade, made of carbon fiber composite, is
   easily extended to a multiple-blade system without adding much mass. The
   micro pin fin arrays were created with the LIGA photolithography
   technique. The cooling performance of the heat sink system was
   demonstrated in single-channel and multiple-channel test facilities. The
   single-channel test results show that the active heat sink with the
   agitator operating at a frequency of 686 Hz and peak-to-peak
   displacement of 1.4 mm achieved a low thermal resistance of 0.053 C/W in
   a channel with a 7.9 m/sec flow velocity. Different configurations of
   the translational agitator with multiple blades were fabricated and
   tested in a 26-channel, full-size heat sink. Vibrational characteristics
   are also provided.}},

Abstract = {{Active devices, such as synthetic jets and oscillating plate agitators
   were found to be effective in cooling of high-heat-flux electronics.
   These devices generate unsteady flows, thinning the thermal boundary
   layer and enhancing turbulent transport. However, the active devices
   cause extra power consumption due to flow friction and separation. It is
   important to understand the factors influencing power consumption in
   these devices if they are to be applied in cooling system designs. The
   present study analyzes fluid damping and power consumption in
   high-frequency (about 1000 Hz) synthetic jets and oscillating plate
   agitators driven by piezoelectric stacks. This analysis is done
   numerically, since it is difficult to measure fluid damping. In the
   simulations, the moving part of the active device is modeled with the
   moving wall boundary condition. The mesh is updated and the flow is
   calculated every time the moving part changes its position. The coherent
   vortex structures generated by theses active devices, like vortices in
   the synthetic jet cavity or in the oscillating plate tip gap region, are
   found to cause fluid damping and power consumption. Fluidic power
   consumption levels with different geometries and different operating
   frequencies and amplitudes are studied. A correlation is developed to

Abstract = {{Traditional heat sinks for electronics cooling have become ever more
   difficult to design to meet the high dissipation rate of modem
   high-heat-flux electronics. Active devices, especially devices operating
   at a high frequency, show promise toward enhancing heat transfer
   performance. However, active devices generate noise that may not be
   acceptable to personnel. The present work studies acoustic
   characteristics of piezoelectrically-driven synthetic jets and
   oscillating plate agitators operating at high frequency (around 1000 Hz)
   employed in an electronics cooling module for heat transfer enhancement
   purposes. The A-weighted noise level from such actuators is measured and
   found to increase with increases of driving voltage and operational
   frequency. The measured sound pressure level of the active devices used
   in our present enhanced heat transfer module can be as high as 100 dB.
   Through a power spectrum analysis, we find that most acoustic energy is
   in a narrow frequency band close to the operating frequency of the
   active device. To decrease the noise level, a muffler, which also allows
   cooling air to recirculate through the equipment cabinet, has been
   designed and tested. An analytical model is employed to select the
   geometry of the muffler for optimal performance based on acoustic
   characteristics of the active devices and the through-flow pressure
   drop. The muffler having this optimal design is fabricated and tested
   and found to be able to decrease the noise level generated by two
   actuators from 83 dB to 64 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer during compression of air in a long, thin tube is studied
   by CFD. The tube represents one of the many in a honeycomb geometry
   inserted in a liquid piston air compressor to minimize temperature rise.
   A dimensionless number for the heat flow rate that includes the changing
   heat transfer area between the tube wall and air during compression is
   used. From the CFD results, alinear relation between the inverse of this
   dimensionless heat flow rate and the Stanton number is found. Using
   thisrelation, the transient volume-averaged temperature, and heat flow
   rate from the air can be well predicted by thermodynamic modeling. With
   the heat transfer model, a non-linear ODE is solved numerically
   todetermine the average temperature and pressure. The application of
   this study can be found in liquid piston air compressors for compressed
   air energy storage systems.}},

Abstract = {{The compression process in a piston cylinder device in a Compressed Air
   Energy Storage (CABS) system is studied computationally. Twelve
   different cases featuring four different compression space
   length-to-radius aspect ratios and three different Reynolds numbers are
   studied computationally using the commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT. The
   solutions show that for compression with a constant velocity, the
   compression can be approximated by a polytropic pressure vs. volume
   relation. The polytropic exponent, n, characterizes the heat transfer
   and temperature rise of the air being compressed. For the cases
   computed, it varies from 1.124 to 1.305 and is found to be more affected
   by Reynolds number and less by the length-to-radius ratio. Since the
   efficiency and storage power of the compressor-depend on pressure vs.
   volume trajectory during compression, they are written as functions of
   the pressure rise ratio and the polytropic exponent, n. The efficiency
   is high at the beginning of the compression process, and decreases as
   the compression proceeds. The effect of temperature rise or heat
   transfer on efficiency and storage power is shown by comparing the
   efficiency and storage power vs. volume curves having different n
   values. Smaller temperature rise always results in higher efficiency but
   lower dimensionless storage power for the same compression pressure
   ratio. The storage power is used in this study to distinguish the
   compression process effect (n effect) and the compressor's size effect
   on the storage power. The likelihood of flow transitioning into
   turbulent flow is discussed. A k - epsilon Reynolds Averaged Navier
   Stokes (RANS) turbulence model is used to calculate one of the larger
   Reynolds number cases. The calculated polytropic exponent was only 0.02
   different from that of the laminar flow solution. The CFD results show
   also that during compression, complex voracity patterns develop, which
   help mix the cold fluid near the wall with the hot fluid in the inner
   region, beneficial to achieving a higher efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of a representative combustor exit temperature profile on
   leakage flow film cooling effectiveness were experimentally documented.
   This was done in a stationary, linear blade row cascade with an
   axisymmetric blade platform of dolphin-nose-shape. Endwall adiabatic
   film cooling effectiveness distributions and near-endwall passage
   thermal fields are documented. Results from the case with a
   representative combustor exit temperature profile are compared to those
   with other combustor exit temperature profiles including a base case
   with a uniform temperature distribution. All cases were done in the same
   facility over a range of disk cavity leakage flow rates. This study
   quantifies the sensitivity of endwall film cooling due to coolant in the
   leakage flow and in the approach flow to the shape of the combustor exit
   temperature profile. The results indicate that leakage flow film cooling
   effectiveness is significantly lower with a well-mixed (uniform
   temperature) combustor exit temperature profile than in cases in which
   the combustor exit temperature distribution is strongly variable. That
   is, it is demonstrated that combustor cooling flow aids endwall
   protection considerably. It is also shown that leakage flow has only a
   mild influence over the endwall cooling that can be attributed to
   coolant in the approach flow.}},

Abstract = {{In pavement infrastructure, it is important to characterise the surfaces
   for an effective prediction of noise. One of the major influencing
   variables, texture orientation, also called spikiness, is a measure of
   how spiky the surface asperities are. Tyre-pavement interaction noise is
   associated with mechanisms triggered by micro-, macro- and megatexture.
   Of the variables within macro- texture range, texture spikiness has
   gained increased interest by providing explanations for scenarios with
   similar texture direction and mean profile depth on the same level of
   distress yet exhibiting very different noise levels. A tool created in
   this research, `PARSER', facilitated computation of skewness/spikiness
   statistics. This paper therefore tenably quantifies texture spikiness by
   the method of skewness of amplitude distribution function. Consequently,
   a logical quantification of texture spikiness has facilitated a
   phenomenological noise prediction model. When properly quantified,
   texture spikiness is an indispensable tyre-pavement interaction
   variable.}},

Abstract = {{The use of microalgae for biofuel production will be beneficial to
   society if we can produce biofuels at large scales with minimal
   mechanical energy input in the production process. Understanding
   micro-algal physiological responses under variable environmental
   conditions in bioreactors is essential for the optimization of biofuel
   production. We demonstrate that measuring micro-algal swimming speed
   provides information on culture health and total fatty acid
   accumulation. Three strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii were grown
   heterotrophically on acetate and subjected to various levels of nitrogen
   starvation. Other nutrient levels were explored to determine their
   effect on micro-algal kinetics. Swimming velocities were measured with
   two-dimensional micro-particle tracking velocimetry. The results show an
   inverse linear relationship between normalized total fatty acid mass
   versus swimming speed of micro-algal cells. Analysis of RNA sequencing
   data confirms these results by demonstrating that the biological
   processes of cell motion and the generation of energy precursors are
   significantly down-regulated. Experiments demonstrate that changes in
   nutrient concentration in the surrounding media also affect swimming
   speed. The findings have the potential for the in situ and indirect
   assessment of lipid content by measuring micro-algal swimming kinetics.

Abstract = {{There are many modalities that may be used to enhance heat transfer
   performance. One of these modes, the embossing of channel walls with
   dimples and/or protrusions, is a technique which has the advantage of
   simplicity of fabrication. The assessment of the quality of a
   geometry-based heat transfer enhancement technique frequently involves
   the change in pressure drop that accompanies the geometric modification.
   This realization provides the motivation for the investigation reported
   here. The focus of this work is the identification of the existence of
   various sub-regimes within the laminar-flow regime. The investigation
   was implemented by numerical simulation supplemented by a
   three-dimensional model of periodic fully developed flow. The selected
   channel-height Reynolds number range extended from 200 to 800. Within
   this range, three sub-regime laminar flows were identified:
   friction-dominated flow, inertial-loss-dominated flow, and the
   transition between these flows. Another focus of the results was the
   presentation of patterns of fluid flow and their impacts on the
   variation of the pressure drop with Reynolds number.}},

Abstract = {{Multivariate analysis of cell culture bioprocess data has the potential
   of unveiling hidden process characteristics and providing new insights
   into factors affecting process performance. This study investigated the
   time-series data of 134 process parameters acquired throughout the
   inoculum train and the production bioreactors of 243 runs at the
   Genentech's Vacaville manufacturing facility. Two multivariate methods,
   kernel-based support vector regression (SVR) and partial least square
   regression (PLSR), were used to predict the final antibody concentration
   and the final lactate concentration. Both product titer and the final
   lactate level were shown to be predicted accurately when data from the
   early stages of the production scale were employed. Using only process
   data from the inoculum train, the prediction accuracy of the final
   process outcome was lower; the results nevertheless suggested that the
   history of the culture may exert significant influence on the final
   process outcome. The parameters contributing most significantly to the
   prediction accuracy were related to lactate metabolism and cell
   viability in both the production scale and the inoculum train. Lactate
   consumption, which occurred rather independently of the residual glucose
   and lactate concentrations, was shown to be a prominent factor in
   determining the final outcome of production-scale cultures. The results
   suggest possible opportunities to intervene in metabolism, steering it
   towards the type with a strong propensity towards high productivity.
   Such intervention could occur in the inoculum stage or in the early
   stage of the production-scale reactors. Overall, this study presents
   pattern recognition as an important process analytical technology (PAT).
   Furthermore, the high correlation between lactate consumption and high
   productivity can provide a guide to apply quality by design (QbD)
   principles to enhance process robustness. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{An objective quasicontinuum (OQC) method is developed for simulating
   rodlike systems that can be represented as a combination of locally
   objective structures. An objective structure (OS) is one for which a
   group of atoms, called a ``fundamental domain{''} (FD), is repeated
   using specific rules of translation and rotation to build a more complex
   structure. An objective Cauchy-Born rule defines the kinematics of the
   OS atoms in terms of a set of symmetry parameters and the positions of
   the FD atoms. The computational advantage lies in the capability of
   representing a large system of atoms through a small set of symmetry
   parameters and FD atom positions. As an illustrative example, we
   consider the deformation of a copper single-crystal nanobeam which can
   be described as an OS. OQC simulations are performed for uniform and
   nonuniform bending for two different orientations (nanobeam axis
   oriented along {[}111] and {[}100]) and compared with elastica results.
   In the uniform bending case, the {[}111]-oriented single-crystal
   nanobeam experiences elongation, while the {[}100]-oriented nanobeam
   experiences contraction in total length. The nonuniform bending allows
   for stretching, contraction, and bending as deformation. Under certain
   loading conditions, dislocation nucleation is observed within the FD.

Title = {{Optical dielectric function of gold}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{In metal optics gold assumes a special status because of its practical
   importance in optoelectronic and nano-optical devices, and its role as a
   model system for the study of the elementary electronic excitations that
   underlie the interaction of electromagnetic fields with metals. However,
   largely inconsistent values for the frequency dependence of the
   dielectric function describing the optical response of gold are found in
   the literature. We performed precise spectroscopic ellipsometry
   measurements on evaporated gold, template-stripped gold, and
   single-crystal gold to determine the optical dielectric function across
   a broad spectral range from 300 nm to 25 mu m (0.05-4.14 eV) with high
   spectral resolution. We fit the data to the Drude free-electron model,
   with an electron relaxation time tau(D) = 14 +/- 3 fs and plasma energy
   h omega(p) = 8.45 eV. We find that the variation in dielectric functions
   for the different types of samples is small compared to the range of
   values reported in the literature. Our values, however, are comparable
   to the aggregate mean of the collection of previous measurements from
   over the past six decades. This suggests that although some variation
   can be attributed to surface morphology, the past measurements using
   different approaches seem to have been plagued more by systematic errors
   than previously assumed. DOI:10.1103/PhysRevB.86.235147}},

Abstract = {{The interaction of two domain walls (DWs) at a cross-shaped vertex
   fabricated from two ferromagnetic nanowires has been experimentally
   investigated. Both magnetostatically repulsive and attractive
   interactions have been probed. It is found that in the repulsive case, a
   passing DW may directly induce the depinning of another that is already
   pinned at a vertex. This effect can be qualitatively described by
   considering only simple, magnetostatic-charge-based arguments. In the
   attractive case, however, asymmetric pinning is found, with complete
   suppression of depinning possible. This observed effect is contrary to
   simple charge-based arguments and highlights the need for full
   micromagnetic characterization of the DW interactions in more complex

Abstract = {{Two poly(ethylene-alt-propylene)-b-poly-(ethylene

   combination of anionic and RAFT polymerizations, followed by acid
   hydrolysis. Micellar aggregation and gelation behavior in aqueous
   solutions were studied by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and rheology,
   respectively. DLS measurements on dilute solutions revealed that the
   triblock terpolymers form micelles with PEP cores and PEO-P(NIPAm-co-AA)
   coronae at room temperature and undergo a micelle to micellar aggregate
   transition upon heating. Rheological measurements showed that micellar
   aggregation manifests itself as gelation at higher concentrations
   (similar to 4 wt \%). The observed thermoresponsive aggregation and
   gelation is due to the intermicellar association of P(NIPAm-co-AA)
   blocks in the coronae above the lower critical solution temperature of
   the P(NIPAm-co-AA) block. The critical micellar aggregation and gelation
   temperatures are controlled by the mole fraction and degree of acrylic
   acid (AA) ionization in the P(NIPAm-co-AA) block, and therefore they can
   be modulated as functions of both pH and AA content in the polymer.}},

Abstract = {{Polyethylene-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PE-g-PMMA) copolymers were
   prepared using a combination of ring-opening metathesis polymerization
   (ROMP), hydrogenation, and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP).
   Approximately 20 PMMA side chains per molecule with average degrees of
   polymerization 6, 12, and 24 were grown via a ``grafting from{''}
   approach from a Br-substituted linear PE backbone with M-w = 56 000. The
   resulting graft copolymers were evaluated as compatibilizing agents for
   binary PE/PMMA homopolymer blends. The roles of PMMA side chain length
   and different compatibilizer concentration in the polymer blends were
   investigated, and the mechanical and morphological properties of blends
   containing 70\% PE and 30\% PMMA by weight were examined. The presence
   of the compatibilizer reduced the average PMMA droplet size
   substantially, even at compatibilizer loadings as low as 1\%.
   Furthermore, the compatibilized blends exhibited significant
   improvements in elastic modulus, yield strength, and scratch resistance
   as compared to the binary blends. Adhesion testing confirmed the ability
   of PE-g-PMMA to act as an effective PE/PMMA adhesion promoter.
   Remarkably, the graft copolymer with the shortest side chains was the
   most effective compatibilizer. This counterintuitive result is
   tentatively attributed to kinetic limitations in partitioning of the
   graft copolymers to the interface.}},

Abstract = {{As stochastic simulations become increasingly common in biological
   research, tools for analysis of such systems are in demand. The
   deterministic analog to stochastic models, a set of probability moment
   equations equivalent to the Chemical Master Equation (CME), offers the
   possibility of a priori analysis of systems without the need for
   computationally costly Monte Carlo simulations. Despite the drawbacks of
   the method, in particular non-linearity in even the simplest of cases,
   the use of moment equations combined with moment-closure techniques has
   been used effectively in many fields. The techniques currently available
   to generate moment equations rely upon analytical expressions that are
   not efficient upon scaling. Additionally, the resulting moment-dependent
   matrix is lower diagonal and demands massive memory allocation in
   extreme cases. Here it is demonstrated that by utilizing factorial
   moments and the probability generating function (the Z-transform of the
   probability distribution) a recursive algorithm is produced. The
   resulting method is scalable and particularly efficient when high-order
   moments are required. The matrix produced is banded and often demands
   substantially less memory resources. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Stochastic model reduction using a modified Hill-type kinetic rate law}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{In the present work, we address a major challenge facing the modeling of
   biochemical reaction networks: when using stochastic simulations, the
   computational load and number of unknown parameters may dramatically
   increase with system size and complexity. A proposed solution to this
   challenge is the reduction of models by utilizing nonlinear reaction
   rate laws in place of a complex multi-reaction mechanism. This type of
   model reduction in stochastic systems often fails when applied outside
   of the context in which it was initially conceived. We hypothesize that
   the use of nonlinear rate laws fails because a single reaction is
   inherently Poisson distributed and cannot match higher order statistics.
   In this study we explore the use of Hill-type rate laws as an
   approximation for gene regulation, specifically transcription
   repression. We matched output data for several simple gene networks to
   determine Hill-type parameters. We show that the models exhibit
   inaccuracies when placed into a simple feedback repression model. By
   adding an additional abstract reaction to the models we account for
   second-order statistics. This split Hill rate law matches higher order
   statistics and demonstrates that the new model is able to more
   accurately describe the mean protein output. Finally, the modified Hill
   model is shown to be modular and models retain accuracy when placed into
   a larger multi-gene network. The work as presented may be used in gene
   regulatory or cell-signaling networks, where multiple binding events can
   be captured by Hill kinetics. The added benefit of the proposed
   split-Hill kinetics is the improved accuracy in modeling stochastic
   effects. We demonstrate these benefits with a few specific reaction
   network examples. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Background: Malaria causes over one million deaths annually, posing an
   enormous health and economic burden in endemic regions. The completion
   of genome sequencing of the causative agents, a group of parasites in
   the genus Plasmodium, revealed potential drug and vaccine candidates.
   However, genomics-driven target discovery has been significantly
   hampered by our limited knowledge of the cellular networks associated
   with parasite development and pathogenesis. In this paper, we propose an
   approach based on aligning neighborhood PPI subnetworks across species
   to identify network components in the malaria parasite P. falciparum.
   Results: Instead of only relying on sequence similarities to detect
   functional orthologs, our approach measures the conservation between the
   neighborhood subnetworks in protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
   in two species, P. falciparum and E. coli. 1,082 P. falciparum proteins
   were predicted as functional orthologs of known transcriptional
   regulators in the E. coli network, including general transcriptional
   regulators, parasite-specific transcriptional regulators in the ApiAP2
   protein family, and other potential regulatory proteins. They are
   implicated in a variety of cellular processes involving chromatin
   remodeling, genome integrity, secretion, invasion, protein processing,
   and metabolism.
   Conclusions: In this proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate that a
   subnetwork alignment approach can reveal previously uncharacterized
   members of the subnetworks, which opens new opportunities to identify
   potential therapeutic targets and provide new insights into parasite
   biology, pathogenesis and virulence. This approach can be extended to
   other systems, especially those with poor genome annotation and a
   paucity of knowledge about cellular networks.}},

Abstract = {{Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are persistent organic pollutants in the
   environment and have been reported to have nonpoint sources. In this
   study, six PFAAs with different chain lengths were monitored in
   stormwater runoff from seven storm events (2009-2011) at various outfall
   locations corresponding to different watershed land uses. We found
   PFAA(s) in 100\% of stormwater runoff samples. Monitoring results and
   statistical analysis show that PFAAs in stormwater runoff from
   residential areas mainly came from rainfall. On the other hand,
   non-atmospheric sources at both industrial and commercial areas
   contributed PFAAs in stormwater runoff. The mass flux of PFAAs from
   stormwater runoff in the Twin Cities (Minneapolis and St. Paul, MN)
   metropolitan area is estimated to be about 7.86 kg/year. In addition,
   for the first time, we monitored PFAAs on the particles/debris in
   stormwater runoff and found high-level PFOS on the particulate matter in
   runoff collected from both industrial and commercial areas; the levels
   were so high that the finding could not be explained by the solid-water
   partitioning or adsorption. PFOS on the particulate matter is suspected
   to have originated from industrial/commercial products, entering the
   waste stream as PFOS containing particles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

   variability has been observed in all quality parameters from each
   continent and among continents; (2) with a few exceptions the
   variability seems to be within the expected range; (3) inconsistent
   monitoring data as well as inconsistent quality assurance and quality
   control measures were reported among studies, which may be partially
   responsible for variability of water quality results; (4) compared with
   historic data, the concentration of total Pb decreased exponentially,

   (5) first flush effects of pollutants based on concentration have been
   reported consistently (however, mass first flush effects for pollutants
   have been reported inconsistently compared with concentration first
   flush effect); (6) most metal pollutants and phosphorus are present in

Pages = {{6753-6762}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have indicated that raingardens are effective at
   removing petroleum hydrocarbons from stormwater. There are concerns,
   however, that petroleum hydrocarbons could accumulate in raingarden
   soil, potentially resulting in liability for the site owner. In this
   work, 75 soil samples were collected from 58 raingardens and 4 upland
   (i.e., control) sites in the Minneapolis, Minnesota area, representing a
   range of raingarden ages and catchment land uses. Total petroleum
   hydrocarbon (TPH) concentrations in the samples were quantified, as were
   16S rRNA genes for Bacteria and two functional genes that encode for
   enzymes used in the degradation of petroleum hydrocarbons. TPH levels in
   all of the raingarden soil samples were low (<3 mu g/kg) and not
   significantly different from one another. The TPH concentration in
   raingarden soil samples was, however, significantly greater (p <= 0.002)
   than TPH levels in upland sites. In addition, the number of copies of
   Bacteria 16S rRNA genes and functional genes were greater in the
   raingardens planted with deeply-rooted natives and cultivars than in
   raingardens containing simply turf grass or mulch (p < 0.036),
   suggesting that planted raingardens may be better able to assimilate TPH
   inputs. The ability of microorganisms present in the soil samples to
   degrade a representative petroleum hydrocarbon (naphthalene) was also
   investigated in batch experiments. A sub-set of the field sites was

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory + Hubbard U (DFT + U) calculations, we
   investigate how aluminum affects the spin crossover of iron in MgSiO3
   perovskite (Pv) and post-perovskite (Ppv), the major mineral phases in
   the Earth's lower mantle. We find that the presence of aluminum does not
   change the response of iron spin state to pressure: only ferric iron
   (Fe3+) in the octahedral (B)-site undergoes a crossover from high-spin
   (HS) to low-spin (LS) state, while Fe3+ in the dodecahedral (A)-site
   remains in the HS state, same as in Al-free cases. However, aluminum
   does significantly affect the placement of Fe3+ in these mineral phases.
   The most stable atomic configuration has all Al3+ in the B-site and all
   Fe3+ in the A-site (thus in the HS state). Metastable configurations
   with LS Fe3+ in the B-site can happen only at high pressures and high
   temperatures. Therefore, experimental observations of LS Fe3+ at high
   pressures in Al-bearing Pv require diffusion of iron from the A-site to
   the B-site and should be sensitive to the annealing temperature and
   schedule. In the Earth's lower mantle, the elastic anomalies
   accompanying the B-site HS-LS crossover exhibited in Al-free Pv are
   likely to be considerably reduced, according to the B-site Fe3+
   population. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   difference, wetting angle, and growth angle are studied under both shape

   a wider operating range of gain than a standard PI controller used

Title = {{ABA-triblock copolymer ion gels for CO2 separation applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEMBRANE SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{423}},
Pages = {{20-26}},
Month = {{DEC 15}},
Abstract = {{The gas separation performance of two block copolymer ion gel systems
   were examined for CO2/N-2 and CO2/CH4 gas pairs. The ion gels were
   formed by self-assembly of 10-15 wt\% poly(styrene-b-ethylene
   oxide-b-styrene) (SOS) and poly(styrene-b-methyl methacrylate-b-styrene)
   (SMS) triblock copolymers in the ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide
   ({[}EMIM]{[}TFSA]), via association of the insoluble S blocks. Due to
   the high ionic liquid (IL) concentration, these gels exhibit rapid gas
   transport properties as well as high selectivity. The selectivity for
   both gas pairs was influenced by the type of polymer midblock: the SOS
   gel shows higher selectivity than both pure IL and SMS gels. Gas
   solubility tests on {[}EMI]{[}TFSA]/PEO solutions indicate that
   poly(ethylene oxide) can suppress the solubility of N-2 and CH4, and
   thereby increase the selectivity for CO2. This important result
   qualitatively agrees with the gel gas separation performance, and
   confirms the importance of the midblock chemistry. Additionally, since
   the selectivity mainly stems from the differential gas solubility rather
   than gas diffusivity, the real selectivities obtained from mixed gas
   experiments are almost the same as the ideal selectivities. Ion gels
   show favorable separation performance in comparison with the
   corresponding ``upper bound{''} on the Robeson plots for CO2/N-2 and
   CO2/CH4, highlighting the potential of these gels in future
   CO2-selective membrane separation. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Micellar polymorphism from block copolymers has been well documented,
   but most attention has focused on noncrystalline hydrophobic systems. We
   have investigated the micellization in water of model diblock copolymers
   with semicrystalline polyethylene (PE) as the core-forming component.
   Poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide)-polyethylene (AE) diblock copolymers were
   synthesized by a combination of anionic and RAFT polymerizations. The
   bulk nanostructures were probed by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
   and AE diblock copolymers were found to be moderately segregated at 140
   degrees C. Dispersions of AE amphiphiles in water were prepared by
   direct dissolution at 120 degrees C (i.e., above the melting transition
   of PE) followed by cooling to 25 degrees C. By manipulating the
   composition of AE diblock copolymers, discrete structures with oblate
   ellipsoidal, cylindrical, and bilayer morphologies were produced, as
   evidenced in cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The
   self-assembled aggregates were also studied by small-angle neutron
   scattering (SANS) and dilute solution rheology. The semicrystalline
   nature of the nanostructures was further revealed by differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC) and wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS). A
   stepwise ``micellization-crystallization{''} process was proposed as the
   micelle formation mechanism, as supported by the existence of similar
   nanostructures at 120 degrees C using SANS. This strategy holds promise
   for a general protocol toward the production of giant wormlike micelles
   and vesicles with semicrystalline polymeric cores.}},

Abstract = {{Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) requires the cellular
   transcription factor core binding factor subunit beta (CBF beta) to
   stabilize its viral infectivity factor (Vif) protein and neutralize the
   APOBEC3 restriction factors. CBF beta normally heterodimerizes with the
   RUNX family of transcription factors, enhancing their stability and
   DNA-binding affinity. To test the hypothesis that Vif may act as a RUNX
   mimic to bind CBF beta, we generated a series of CBF beta mutants at the
   RUNX/CBF beta interface and tested their ability to stabilize Vif and
   impact transcription at a RUNX-dependent promoter. While several CBF
   beta amino acid substitutions disrupted promoter activity, none of these
   impacted the ability of CBF beta to stabilize Vif or enhance degradation
   of APOBEC3G. A mutagenesis screen of CBF beta surface residues
   identified a single amino acid change, F68D, that disrupted Vif binding
   and its ability to degrade APOBEC3G. This mutant still bound RUNX and
   stimulated RUNX-dependent transcription. These separation-of-function
   mutants demonstrate that HIV-1 Vif and the RUNX transcription factors
   interact with cellular CBF beta on genetically distinct surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Human tissue specimens are critical reagents in the diagnosis of disease
   and biomedical research. Tissues experience rapid degradation
   immediately after ligation from their blood supply. A variety of
   processing techniques are employed to prevent the degradation of tissue
   samples, principally chemical fixation and thermal processing. The
   success of processing techniques is measured by the preservation of
   tissue morphology, as well as the critical biomarkers. In preservation
   of tissue specimens, formaldehyde is the most widely used fixative that
   maintains tissue morphology. However, the cross-links resulting from
   chemical interactions between formaldehyde and biomolecules in the
   specimens introduce difficulties in detection and extraction of antigens
   for analysis. Alternative processing methods, such as chemical fixation
   (e.g., alcohol-based) or thermal processing (e.g., freezing) help avoid
   the loss of antigenicity due to cross-linking, but introduce
   morphological artifacts. In this article, we review methods of
   processing of fresh tissue samples, as well as the effects of these
   procedures on morphology and antigenicity of the preserved tissues as
   assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry, proteomics, and genomics.}},

   sp. UMN271, a locally isolated facultative heterotrophic strain, and to
   evaluate the nutrient removal efficiencies by alga compared with those
   from the conventionally decomposed LSM algae system. The results showed
   that addition of 0.1\% (v/v) acetic, propionic and butyric acids,
   respectively, could promote algal growth, enhance nutrient removal
   efficiencies and improve total lipids productivities during a 7-day
   batch cultivation. Similar results were observed when the acidogenic
   fermentation was applied to the sterilized and raw digested LSM rich in
   volatile fatty acids (VFAs). High algal growth rate (0.90 d(-1)) and
   fatty acid content (10.93\% of the dry weight) were observed for the raw
   VFA-enriched manure sample. Finally, the fatty acid profile analyses
   showed that Chlorella sp. grown on acidogenically digested manure could
   be used as a feedstock for high-quality biodiesel production. (C) 2012

   In addition, algae cultivated on process water had 18.9\% higher carbon

Abstract = {{Valeric acid and 2-methylbutyric acid serve as chemical intermediates
   for a variety of applications such as plasticizers, lubricants and
   pharmaceuticals. The commercial process for their production uses toxic
   intermediates like synthesis gas and relies on non-renewable
   petroleum-based feedstock. In this work, synthetic metabolic pathways
   were constructed in Escherichia coli for the renewable production of
   these chemicals directly from glucose. The native leucine and isoleucine
   biosynthetic pathways in E. calf were expanded for the synthesis of
   valeric acid and 2-methylbutyric acid (2MB) respectively by the
   introduction of aldehyde dehydrogenases and 2-ketoacid decarboxylases.
   Various aldehyde dehydrogenases and 2-ketoacid decarboxylases were
   investigated for their activities in the constructed pathways. Highest
   titers of 2.59 g/L for 2-mthylbutyric acid and 2.58 g/L for valeric acid
   were achieved in shake flask experiments through optimal combinations of
   these enzymes. This work demonstrates the feasibility of renewable
   production of these high volume aliphatic carboxylic acids. (C) 2012

Volume = {{96}},
Pages = {{26-36}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{A cyclic cohesive zone model is proposed to simulate the mode-I crack
   growth in quasibrittle structures under compressive fatigue. The
   constitutive behavior of the cohesive elements is formulated for both
   tension and compression regimes. A strain-softening cohesive law is
   adopted for the tension regime whereas a plastic-type cohesive behavior
   is considered for the compression regime. It is shown that the proposed
   model is able to capture some essential fracture behaviors of
   quasibrittle structures under compressive fatigue, which include the
   onset of fatigue crack growth, the gradual decrease in crack growth
   rate, and the exhaustion of residual tensile stress over the cycles.
   Based on a fracture process zone (FPZ)-equivalence principle, it is
   further shown that the existing kinetics equation for tensile fatigue
   crack can be extended to the crack growth under cyclic compression. (C)

Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{A variety of methods have been used to introduce chemicals into a stream
   or to mix two or more streams of different compositions using
   microfluidic devices. In the following paper, the introduction of
   cryoprotective agents (CPAs) used during cryopreservation of cells in
   order to protect them from freezing injuries and increase viability post
   thaw is described. Dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) is the most commonly used
   CPA. We aim to optimize the operating conditions of a two-stream
   microfluidic device to introduce a 10\% vol/vol solution of DMSO into a
   cell suspension. Transport behavior of DMSO between two streams in the
   device has been experimentally characterized for a spectrum of flow
   conditions (0.7 < Re < 10), varying initial donor stream concentrations,
   (1\% vol/vol < C-o < 15\% vol/vol) and different flow rate fractions
   (0.23 < f(q) < 0.77). The outlet cell stream concentration is analyzed
   for two different flow configurations: one with the cell stream flowing
   on top of the DMSO-rich donor stream, and the other with the cell stream
   flowing beneath the heavy DMSO-laden stream. We establish a transition
   from a diffusive mode of mass transfer to gravity-influenced convective
   currents for Atwood numbers (A(t)) in the range of (1.7 x 10(-3) < A(t)
   < 3.1 x 10(-3)) for the latter configuration. Flow visualization with
   cells further our understanding of the effect of A(t) on the nature of
   mass transport. Cell motion studies performed with Jurkat cells confirm
   a high cell recovery from the device while underscoring the need to
   collect both the streams at the outlet of the device and suggesting flow
   conditions that will help us achieve the target DMSO outlet
   concentration for clinical scale flow rates of the cell suspension. (C)

Abstract = {{A network-compressive transmission protocol is developed in which
   correlated sensor observations belonging to a finite alphabet are
   linearly combined as they traverse the network on their way to a sink
   node. Statistical dependencies are modeled using factor graphs. The
   sum-product algorithm is run under different modeling assumptions to
   estimate the maximum a posteriori set of observations given the
   compressed measurements at the sink node. Error exponents are derived
   for cyclic and acyclic factor graphs using the method of types, showing
   that observations can be recovered with arbitrarily low probability of
   error as the network size grows. Simulated tests corroborate the
   theoretical claims.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate compositions of silica-collagen hybrid materials
   as potential artificial corneal substitutes, how these components affect
   the optical and biomechanical properties of the hybrids, and their
   biocompatibility in an organ culture model.
   METHODS. Hybrid materials were created from different proportions of
   collagen and silica precursors and manufactured to specific dimensions.
   The microstructure of the materials was determined by electron
   microscopy and mechanical strength was measured by using suture pullout
   tests. The refractive index and transmittance were measured by using an
   Abbe refractometer and a spectrophotometer. Materials were implanted
   into rabbit corneas to determine their epithelialization in organ
   culture.
   RESULTS. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the hybrid
   material consisted of silica-encapsulating collagen fibrils. The
   refractive index ranged from 1.332 to 1.403 depending upon the
   composition and manufacturing characteristics. The rupture strength of a
   3: 1 (silica: collagen ratio by weight) rehydrated xerogel was 0.161 +/-
   0.073 N/mm (n = 12), while the hydrogels and 9: 1 xerogel were too
   fragile for suturing. Re-epithelialization of 5- to 6-mm-wide rabbit
   corneal epithelial defects was complete in 5.5 +/- 2.4 days (n = 6),
   with evidence of epithelial stratification.
   CONCLUSIONS. Silica-collagen hybrid materials can be manufactured to
   specific dimensions to serve as a possible artificial corneal
   substitute. In preliminary studies, the materials had favorable optical,
   biomechanical, and biocompatibility properties necessary for replacing
   the corneal stroma. (Invest Ophthalmol Vis Sci. 2012; 53: 8192-8199)

Abstract = {{Runoff from roadways on which road salt (NaCl) has been applied for
   driving safety in winter can form a saline water layer at the bottom of
   a lake, pond, reservoir, or river impoundment. Natural vertical mixing
   of lentic surface water bodies can be hindered by the presence of a
   benthic saline layer and thereby affect lake water quality and ecology.
   To study the formation and disappearance of the saline layer,
   temperature and specific conductance profiles were measured
   intermittently over two years (2007, 2008) and at high frequency during
   one year (2009) in an urban lake of the northern temperate region
   (Tanners Lake, Oakdale, Minnesota). Erosion of the saline layer in the
   spring occurred only in year 2007. In years 2008 and 2009, the saline
   layer persisted throughout the summer only to be removed during fall
   turnover when thermal stratification was at a minimum. In all three
   years, salinity dominated density stratification after ice-out, but was
   quickly overtaken by temperature stratification as the epilimnion
   warmed. The deterministic, unsteady dynamic one-dimensional (1D) lake
   temperature and dissolved oxygen (DO) model MINLAKE was modified by
   including vertical salinity gradients, and it was used to simulate
   summer stratification and mixing dynamics in Tanners Lake. The daily
   adjustment of the hypolimnetic eddy diffusion as a function of lake
   number was an important component in the developed model. This addition
   allowed mixing in the hypolimnion to be stronger in the fall and spring
   when the lake stratification was weaker than in the summer after thermal
   stratification formed. Model results of dissolved oxygen in the water
   column demonstrated that the saline benthic layer can prevent dissolved
   oxygen from reaching lake sediments. The adverse consequences of
   dissolved oxygen depletion on phosphorus recycling from the sediments,
   benthic microbial communities, and fish habitat are well known. Overall,
   the results show how salinity from road salt applications can influence
   water quality and natural mixing in urban lakes. DOI:

Abstract = {{The sediment load transported in a river is the most complex
   hydrological phenomenon due to a large number of obscure parameters and
   the existence of both spatial variability of the basin characteristics
   and temporal climatic patterns. In this paper two artificial neural
   network (ANN) models were developed for semidistributed modeling of the
   suspended sediment load process of the Eel River watershed located in
   California. The first model was an integrated ANN model trained by the
   data of multiple stations inside the watershed. In the second model, a
   geomorphology-based ANN model, space-dependent geomorphologic parameters
   of the subbasins, extracted by geographic information system tools,
   accompanied by time-dependent meteorological data, were imposed on the
   network. In both models, three-layer perceptron neural networks were
   trained considering various combinations of input and hidden layers'
   neurons, and the optimum architectures of the models were selected
   according to the computed evaluation criteria. Furthermore, the ability
   of the models for spatio-temporal modeling of the process was examined
   through the cross-validation technique for a station. The obtained
   results demonstrate that although the predicted sediment load time
   series by both models are in satisfactory agreement with the observed
   data, the geomorphological ANN model produces better performance than an
   integrated model because it employs spatially variable factors of the
   subbasins as the model's inputs. Therefore, the model can operate as a
   nonlinear time-space regression tool rather than a fully lumped model.

Abstract = {{The use of a transparent thin film speaker in a home window can provide
   both an invisible audio playback device and an active noise cancellation
   system. However, several key challenges reed to be addressed for
   development of such a system. A traditional feedforward active noise
   cancellation system uses direct microphone measurements for both
   reference and error signals. Such a system can degrade both the audio
   playback and the noise cancellation performance. Hence a wave separation
   algorithm is used in this paper for separation of the audio playback
   component from the external noise component for the reference signal.
   Further, an online adaptive secondary transfer function estimation
   method is used for accurate removal of the audio component from the
   error signal. Two approaches are attempted for the secondary transfer
   function estimation - use of source audio signals and use of additive
   white noise. The developed algorithms are evaluated in a scaled cabin
   equipped with a window and a transparent thin film actuator.
   Experimental results show that the developed system can preserve the
   auxiliary audio sound while cancelling external noise effectively. The
   system based on the use of source audio signals for secondary path
   estimation is found to yield the largest cancellation of external noise
   while producing the least amplitude of control inputs that cancel
   desired audio signals. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular restriction factors help to defend humans against human
   immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV accessory proteins hijack at least
   three different Cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases, which must be activated
   by the small ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8, in order to counteract host
   cellular restriction factors. We found that conjugation of NEDD8 to
   Cullin-5 by the NEDD8-conjugating enzyme UBE2F is required for HIV
   Vif-mediated degradation of the host restriction factor APOBEC3G (A3G).
   Pharmacological inhibition of the NEDD8 E1 by MLN4924 or knockdown of
   either UBE2F or its RING-protein binding partner RBX2 bypasses the
   effect of Vif, restoring the restriction of HIV by A3G. NMR mapping and
   mutational analyses define specificity determinants of the UBE2F NEDD8
   cascade. These studies demonstrate that disrupting host NEDD8 cascades
   presents a novel antiretroviral therapeutic approach enhancing the
   ability of the immune system to combat HIV.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in land use and drainage have contributed to channel adjustment
   in small-order to medium-order streams in the prairie pothole region of
   south-west Minnesota. Although conversion from prairie to agriculture
   occurred a century ago, recent decades have seen increased subsurface
   tile drainage, annual row crop coverage and channel modifications,
   particularly at road crossings such that channel adjustment is ongoing.
   Channel evolution in Elm and Center Creeks, two fourth-order streams in
   the Blue Earth River basin, was studied to understand relationships
   between changes in channel morphology and suspended sediment
   concentrations. The construction of drainage ditches and expanded
   subsurface tiling has connected isolated basins to stream channels,
   effectively increasing drainage areas of Elm and Center Creeks by
   1520\%. Sinuosity has been reduced by grading and drainage of
   first-order sloughs, channel straightening at road crossings and natural
   cut-offs and agricultural ditching that have shortened Elm Creek by 15\%
   between 1938 and 2003. Stream cross-sectional area was enlarged in
   response to the land-use and drainage changes. In the headwaters, public
   ditches are wider than historic channels and entrenched by berms.
   Unchannelized headwater and upper mainstem portions of Elm Creek are
   also highly entrenched (up to 1.07 meters below the pre-channelization
   bed elevation with a bank height ratio?>?1.5) but have not widened
   substantially. In contrast, the lower main channel has widened by an
   average of 68\%. These channel adjustments contribute to the suspended
   sediment load and violations of Minnesota's turbidity and Index of
   Biotic Integrity standards. The watershed has a low sediment delivery
   ratio because it is a flat, poorly connected landscape and likely
   delivers less sediment to the Minnesota River than steeper rivers
   downstream, such as the Blue Earth River. Entrenchment and increased
   sediment transport capacity in the lower reaches of the river have lead
   to increased sediment delivery to the downstream Blue Earth and
   Minnesota rivers. Understanding geomorphic changes will be important for
   addressing water-quality impairments in the region. Copyright (c) 2011

Abstract = {{A role of the dielectric silica nanoparticle (SiO2 NP) in nanomaterial
   chemoresistors and ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFET) is
   demonstrated in this study. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) and
   indium oxide nanoparticles (In2O3 NP) are layer-by-layer self-assembled
   alternately with oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, respectively.
   Nanomaterial multilayer thin-film is patterned using photolithography
   and electrochemically characterized in various pH buffers. The pH
   sensors are implemented as resistor and transistor in absence and
   presence of SiO2 NP layer. We observed tunable sensitivity and linearity
   of output current flowing through the conducting channel in SWCNT
   chemoresistor and ISFET. The role of SiO2 NP is proven to modulate and
   linearize the sensitivity to pH. The linearization is attributed to a
   positive shift in pH gating voltage in p-type semiconducting SWCNTs. On
   the other hand, a tunable sensitivity is observed whereas the
   linearization is not demonstrated in In2O3 NP ISFETs. The increased
   sensitivity with SiO2 NP in acidic region is caused by a positive shift
   in gate voltage due to the protonation of the surface hydroxyl groups.
   This facile modulation and linearization of the electrochemical
   sensitivity in semiconducting nanomaterial thin-film device by means of
   the additional SiO2 NP layer is useful for developing various functional
   nanomaterial-based biosensors. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{We demonstrate microfabrication and characterization of suspended carbon
   nanotube (CNT) thin-film structures possessing a high degree of
   alignment. The alignment of CNT was achieved by the open microfluidic
   channel template and enhanced by heating the CNT dispersion, which was
   scalable and processable. The degree of alignment, as characterized by
   Raman spectroscopy, yielded a high G- to D-band intensity ratio of 22
   along the fluid flow direction. The microfluidic alignment scheme was
   combined with microfabrication techniques for the fabrication of
   suspended thin-film structures. The sidewall of CNT film pattern, left
   in fluidic channel removal process, was successfully removed by oxygen
   plasma etching with a masking layer of photoresist, as shown by scanning
   electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The resistivity of the
   aligned CNT film was found to be 2.2 x 10(-3) Omega cm, smaller than
   that of films aligned by other techniques. The aligned CNT film was
   released by etching a sacrificial layer. Mechanical characterization
   showed a nominal Young's modulus of 635 GPa and yield strength of 2.4
   GPa on the assumption of a fixed-fixed Euler beam. The reliable,
   scalable and processable fabrication process, the resulting high
   conductivity and excellent mechanical properties may enable aligned CNT
   films to be a potent candidate for electromechanical device
   applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This article presents a systematic frame-work characterizing
   adaptive systems.
   Background: Adaptive systems are those that can appropriately modify
   their behavior to fit the current context. This concept is appealing
   because it offers the possibility of creating computer assistants that
   behave like good human assistants who can provide what is needed without
   being asked. However, the majority of adaptive systems have been
   experimental rather than practical because of the technical challenges
   in accurately perceiving and interpreting users' current cognitive
   state; integrating cognitive state, environment, and task information;
   and using it to predict users' current needs. The authors anticipate
   that recent developments in neurological and physiological sensors to
   identify users' cognitive state will increase interest in adaptive
   systems research and practice over the next few years.
   Method: To inform future efforts in adaptive systems, this work provides
   an organizing framework for characterizing adaptive systems, identifying
   considerations and implications, and suggesting future research issues.
   Results: A two-part framework is presented that (a) categorizes ways in
   which adaptive systems can modify their behavior and (b) characterizes
   trigger mechanisms through which adaptive systems can sense the current
   situation and decide how to adapt.
   Conclusion: The framework provided in this article provides a tool for
   organizing and informing past, present, and future research and
   development efforts in adaptive systems.}},

   hydrolytic enzymes. M. isabellina could not directly utilize cellulose
   and adding cellulase and beta-glucosidase significantly increased the
   cell growth and oil accumulation of M. isabellina on soybean hulls. The
   highest weight loss of soybean hulls was 47.80 \% and the lipid
   production reached 0.14 g from 1 g of soybean hull when 12 U cellulase,
   27.2 U beta-glucosidase, 2,278.56 U pectinase, and 15 U hemicellulase
   were added. Fatty acids (76.82 \%) accumulated in M. isabellina were C16

Abstract = {{Shape-memory polymers (SMPs) have wide range of applications due to
   their ability to sense environmental stimuli and reshape from a
   temporary shape to a permanent shape. Plant oil-based polymeric
   materials are highly concerned in recent years in consideration of
   petroleum depletion and environmental pollution. However, plant
   oil-based polymers are rarely investigated regarding their shape-memory
   characteristics though bio-based SMPs are highly desired nowadays. In
   this study, a series of soybean oil-based shape-memory polyurethanes
   (SSMPUs) are prepared through a mild chemo-enzymatic synthetic route,
   and their properties are fully characterized with tensile testing, DSC,
   dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), and shape-memory testing. Results
   show that SSMPUs are soft rubbers with tensile strength in the range of
   1.92.2?MPa and glass transition temperature in the range of 25 degrees
   C, and possess good shape recoveries at RT when stretching ratio is 10,
   20, and 30\%, respectively. This work would promote the development of
   high-value-added plant oil-based shape-memory polyurethanes.}},

Abstract = {{Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) DNA sequencing allows the systematic
   detection of chemical modifications such as methylation but has not
   previously been applied on a genome-wide scale. We used this approach to
   detect 49,311 putative 6-methyladenine (m6A) residues and 1,407 putative
   5-methylcytosine (m5C) residues in the genome of a pathogenic
   Escherichia coli strain. We obtained strand-specific information for
   methylation sites and a quantitative assessment of the frequency of
   methylation at each modified position. We deduced the sequence motifs
   recognized by the methyltransferase enzymes present in this strain
   without prior knowledge of their specificity. Furthermore, we found that
   deletion of a phage-encoded methyltransferase-endonuclease
   (restriction-modification; RM) system induced global transcriptional
   changes and led to gene amplification, suggesting that the role of RM
   systems extends beyond protecting host genomes from foreign DNA.}},

Abstract = {{The current study presents a new and novel analysis of heat release
   signatures measured by a differential scanning calorimeter (DSC)
   associated with water transport (WT), intracellular ice formation (IIF)
   and extracellular ice formation (EIF). Correlative cryomicroscopy
   experiments were also performed to validate the DSC data. The DSC and
   cryomicroscopy experiments were performed on human dermal fibroblast
   cells (HDFs) at various cytocrit values (0-0.8) at various cooling rates
   (0.5-250 degrees C/min). A comparison of the cryomicroscopy experiments
   with the DSC analysis show reasonable agreement in the water transport
   (cellular dehydration) and IIF characteristics between both the
   techniques with the caveat that IIF measured by DSC lagged that measured
   by cryomicroscopy. This was ascribed to differences in the techniques
   (i.e. cell vs. bulk measurement) and the possibility that not all IIF is
   associated with visual darkening. High and low rates of 0.5 degrees
   C/min and 250 degrees C/min were chosen as HDFs did not exhibit
   significant IIF or WT at each of these extremes respectively. Analysis
   of post-thaw viability data suggested that 10 degrees C/min was the
   presumptive optimal cooling rate for HDFs and was independent of the
   cytocrit value. The ratio of measured heat values associated with IIF
   (q(HF)) to the total heat released from both IIF and water transport or
   from the total cell water content in the sample (q(CW)) was also found
   to increase as the cooling rate was increased from 10 to 250 degrees
   C/min and was independent of the sample cytocrit value. Taken together,
   these observations suggest that the proposed analysis is capable of
   deconvolving water transport and IIF data from the measured DSC latent
   heat thermograms in cell suspensions during freezing. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Volume = {{67}},

Abstract = {{Some drainage ditches in the intensively managed row-crop agricultural
   region of southern Minnesota evolved from a trapezoidal form to
   multi-staged channel forms similar to natural streams. Older ditches
   constructed in cohesive sediment of the Des Moines Lobe till tend to
   follow a channel evolution model developed by Simon and Hupp. Site cross
   sections, longitudinal water and bed profiles and bed material particle
   size were determined according to Harrelson and others at 24 older ditch
   reaches, 5 newly constructed ditch reaches and 13 natural stream
   reaches. Morphological features were hypothesized to change from
   trapezoidal form to flat bench banks, similar to benches found in
   natural stream channels. All data were statistically analyzed with
   respect to drainage area using regression, because channel form is
   directly related to drainage area for a given climate, geology and land
   use. Results show similar regression slope and intercept for bankfull
   channel width and bankfull cross-sectional area (CSA) of older ditches
   and natural streams compared to typical trapezoidal designed ditches.
   Evolved ditches developed a small floodplain bench above the ditch bed
   and adjusted their bankfull widths similar to natural stream channels
   with respect to drainage area. Old ditches showed a relatively strong R
   (2) (0.82, 0.68) for channel CSA and width, a weaker R (2) (0.45) for
   water surface slope, and little to no correlation with bed particle
   size. Channel form appears to have adjusted more quickly than bed facets
   and/or bed particle size distribution. However, stepwise regression
   determined that D-84, width/depth ratio and mean bankfull depth
   explained 83 \% of the variability of channel features across varying
   drainage areas. Findings suggest a possible reduction of long-term
   maintenance costs if older ditches are allowed to evolve over time. A
   stable ditch form similar to natural streams is typically
   self-sustaining, suggesting that prior to a scheduled clean-out, the
   ditch should be examined for hydraulic capacity, sediment transport and
   bank stability.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a resource management problem in a multi-cell downlink OFDMA
   network whereby the goal is to find the optimal combination of (i)
   assignment of users to base stations and (ii) resource allocation
   strategies at each base station. Efficient resource management protocols
   must rely on users truthfully reporting privately held information such
   as downlink channel states. However, individual users can manipulate the
   resulting resource allocation (by misreporting their private
   information) if by doing so they can improve their payoff. Therefore, it
   is of interest to design efficient resource management protocols that
   are strategy-proof, i. e. it is in the users' best interests to
   truthfully report their private information. Unfortunately, we show that
   the implementation of any protocol that is efficient and strategy-proof
   is NP-hard. Thus, we propose a computationally tractable strategy-proof
   mechanism that is approximately efficient, i. e. the solution obtained
   yields at least 1 2 of the optimal throughput. Simulations are provided
   to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{In high-field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, B-0 fields of 7
   and 9.4 T, the RF field shows greater inhomogeneity compared to clinical
   MRI systems with B-0 fields of 1.5 and 3.0 T. In multichannel RF coils,
   the magnitude and phase of the input to each coil element can be
   controlled independently to reduce the nonuniformity of the RF field.
   The convex optimization technique has been used to obtain the optimum
   excitation parameters with iterative solutions for homogeneity in a
   selected region of interest. The pseudoinverse method has also been used
   to find a solution. The simulation results for 9.4- and 7-T MRI systems
   are discussed in detail for the head model. Variation of the simulation
   results in a 9.4-T system with the number of RF coil elements for
   different positions of the regions of interest in a spherical phantom

Abstract = {{Through spatial multiplexing and diversity, multi-input multi-output
   (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) networks can markedly increase transmission
   rates and reliability, while controlling the interference inflicted to
   peer nodes and primary users (PUs) via beamforming. The present paper
   optimizes the design of transmit-and receive-beamformers for ad hoc CR
   networks when CR-to-CR channels are known, but CR-to-PU channels cannot
   be estimated accurately. Capitalizing on a norm-bounded channel
   uncertaintymodel, the optimal beamforming design is formulated to
   minimize the overall mean-square error (MSE) from all data streams,
   while enforcing protection of the PU system when the CR-to-PU channels
   are uncertain. Even though the resultant optimization problem is
   non-convex, algorithms with provable convergence to stationary points
   are developed by resorting to block coordinate ascent iterations, along
   with suitable convex approximation techniques. Enticingly, the novel
   schemes also lend themselves naturally to distributed implementations.
   Numerical tests are reported to corroborate the analytical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Rising energy costs have renewed interest in energy efficient
   separations. Such efficiencies can be defined as the free energy of
   unmixing divided by the work done on and the heat added to the process.
   The greatest efficiencies occur when the energy cost far exceeds any
   capital cost. In this limit, rate processes are not important, and
   efficiency is governed by thermodynamics. Efficiencies for gas
   absorption and stripping are then typically around 50\%. The
   efficiencies of liquidliquid extractions are lower, especially when one
   solute is wanted at higher concentration. The efficiencies of membrane
   separations are higher, but these require high pressure, normally
   obtained mechanically. As a result, membrane efficiencies should be
   reduced by any Carnot efficiency of generating the mechanical energy.
   These results, which are consistent with earlier estimates for
   distillation, have implications for carbon dioxide capture as a route to
   mitigating global warming. (C) 2012 American Institute of Chemical

   Lagrange interpolation formula always leads to very-well-poised basic
   hypergeometric series. As applications we prove that the Watson
   transformation of a balanced (4)phi(3) to a very-well-poised (8)phi(7)
   is equivalent to the Rodrigues-type formula for the Askey-Wilson
   polynomials. By applying the Leibniz formula for the Askey-Wilson

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric translational agitator (PTA) is proposed and its heat
   transfer performance is demonstrated by experiments in a narrow channel.
   For the present study, this channel simulates a portion of an air-cooled
   heat sink. An oval loop shell structure successfully generates
   millimeter-range translational displacement to a blade attached to the
   shell. A PTA operating at 961 Hz as its second resonance mode with a 1.4
   mm displacement under 60 Liters Per Minute (LPM) of cross flow achieved
   about 55\% improvement in heat transfer coefficient compared to the
   non-agitated state. Pressure drop in the test section and the
   corresponding power required to drive the flow through the channel
   against the oscillating blade were measured. In addition, the PTAs were
   tested in the open channel without through-flow to examine the sole
   effect of agitation and to investigate the possibility of using it as a
   stand-alone cooling device. A total Reynolds number was defined to
   characterize the combined effects of cross flow and agitation. The
   Stanton number developed from the relationship between the total
   Reynolds number and heat transfer coefficients enables predicting
   operating performance. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations of the evaporation of stationary, spherical,
   two-component liquid droplets in a laminar, atmospheric pressure, forced
   convective hot-air environment are presented. The transient two-phase
   numerical model includes multi-component diffusion, a comprehensive
   method to deal with the interface including the surface tension effects
   and variation of thermo-physical properties as a function of temperature
   and species concentration in both liquid- and vapor-phases. The model
   has been validated using the experimental data available in literature
   for suspended heptane-decane blended droplets evaporating under a forced
   convective air environment. The validated model is used to study the
   vaporization characteristics of heptane-decane droplets under different
   convective conditions. For an initial composition having 75\% by volume
   of more volatile fuel component, the evaporation transients are
   presented in terms of variations in interface quantities. Flow, species
   and temperature fields are presented at several time instants to show
   the relative strengths of forced convection and Marangoni convection.
   Results show that at low initial Reynolds numbers, the solutal Marangoni
   effects induce a flow-field within the liquid droplet, which opposes the
   flow of the external convective field. The strength of this liquid-phase
   flow field increases with the consumption of the more volatile fuel
   component. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hypertension has been recognized as an independent risk factor for
   intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The objective of this study was to
   assess the effect of chronically elevated blood pressure on amount of
   hematoma in a rat model of ICH. A total of 46 rats were divided into two
   groups-normotensive group (n = 18) and spontaneously hypertensive group
   (n = 28). To induce ICH, we delivered 2 mu L of collagenase solution
   (0.1 U/1 mu L normal saline) into the striatum. Each animal's brain was
   removed 24 h post-surgery for spectrophotometric hemoglobin assay. Equal
   or unequal variance t tests were performed to assess changes in
   variables between the hypertensive and normotensive groups. Tissue
   analysis revealed a statistically significant difference in optical
   density percent change at 540-nm wavelength for the hypertensive vs. the
   normotensive group (261.47 +/- 103.68 and 133.33 +/- 58.53, p < 0.0001,
   respectively). As compared to the normotensive rats, hypertensive rats
   exhibited a higher neurological deficit, loss of balance and
   coordination, and loss of motor function. Our results demonstrated that
   hypertensive rats had significantly higher amounts of hemorrhage in
   comparison to normotensive ones. These findings support the need for
   further adequately powered studies to investigate differences in amount
   of hematoma and corresponding functional impairments due to ICH among
   hypertensive vs. normotensive rats.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic networks have recently being recognized as a powerful
   abstraction to model and represent the temporal changes and dynamic
   aspects of the data underlying many complex systems. Significant
   insights regarding the stable relational patterns among the entities can
   be gained by analyzing temporal evolution of the complex entity
   relations. This can help identify the transitions from one conserved
   state to the next and may provide evidence to the existence of external
   factors that are responsible for changing the stable relational patterns
   in these networks. This paper presents a new data mining method that
   analyzes the time-persistent relations or states between the entities of
   the dynamic networks and captures all maximal non-redundant evolution
   paths of the stable relational states. Experimental results based on
   multiple datasets from real-world applications show that the method is

Abstract = {{Quantification of river bedform variability and complexity is important
   for sediment transport modeling as well as for characterization of river
   morphology. Alluvial bedforms are shown to exhibit highly nonlinear
   dynamics across a range of scales, affect local bed roughness, and vary
   with local hydraulic, hydrologic, and geomorphic properties. This paper
   examines sediment sorting on the crest and trough of gravel bedforms and
   relates it to bed elevation statistics. The data analysed here are the
   spatial and temporal series of bed elevation, grain size distribution of
   surface and subsurface bed materials, and sediment transport rates from
   flume experiments. We describe surface topography through bedform
   variability in height and wavelength and multiscale analysis of bed
   elevations as a function of discharge. We further relate bedform
   migration to preferential distribution of coarse and fine sediments on
   the troughs and crests, respectively, measuring directly surface and
   subsurface grain size distributions, and indirectly the small scale
   roughness variations as estimated from high resolution topographic
   scans.}},

Abstract = {{Crystals and polycrystalline powders of two new oxide materials,
   Tl4CuTeO6 and Tl6CuTe2O10, have been synthesized by hydrothermal and
   solid-state methods. The materials were structurally characterized by
   single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Tl4CuTeO6 and Tl6CuTe2O10 exhibit one
   dimensional anionic slabs of {[}CuTeO6](4-) and {[}CuTe2O10](6-),
   respectively. Common to both slabs is the occurrence of Cu2+O4 distorted
   squares and Te6+O6 octahedra. The slabs are separated by Tl+ cations.
   For Tl4CuTeO6, magnetic measurements indicate a maximum at similar to 8
   K in the temperature dependence of the susceptibility. Low temperature
   neutron diffraction data confirm no long-range magnetic ordering occurs
   and the susceptibility was adequately accounted for by fits to a
   Heisenberg alternating chain model. For Tl6CuTe2O10 on the other hand,
   magnetic measurements revealed paramagnetism with no evidence of
   long-range magnetic ordering. Infrared, UV-vis spectra,
   thermogravimetric, and differential thermal analyses are also reported.

Abstract = {{Gas-borne nanoparticles undergoing coagulation and sintering form
   irregular or fractal-like structures affecting their transport, light
   scattering, effective surface area, and density. Here, zirconia (ZrO2)
   nanoparticles are generated by scalable spray combustion, and their
   mobility diameter and mass are obtained nearly in situ by differential
   mobility analyzer (DMA) and aerosol particle mass (APM) measurements.
   Using these data, the density of ZrO2 and a power law between mobility
   and primary particle diameters, the structure of fractal-like particles
   is determined (mass-mobility exponent, prefactor and average number, and
   surface area mean diameter of primary particles, d(va)). The d(va)
   determined by DMA-APM measurements and this power law is in good
   agreement with the d(va) obtained by ex situ nitrogen adsorption and
   microscopic analysis. Using this combination of measurements and above
   power law, the effect of flame spray process parameters (e.g., precursor
   solution and oxygen flow rate as well as zirconium concentration) on
   fractal-like particle structure characteristics is investigated in
   detail. This reveals that predominantly agglomerates (physically-bonded
   particles) and aggregates (chemically- or sinter-bonded particles) of
   nanoparticles are formed at low and high particle concentrations,

Abstract = {{Basic properties are reported for a previously undocumented biofuel
   mixture of refined, bleached and deodorized soybean oil-butanol and its

   to predict relative density and higher heating values based on mixture
   composition while the Grunberg-Nissan approach was used to predict the
   viscosity-composition relationship. Absolute average deviation values of
   <5.1\%, <0.028\% and <0.012\% were obtained for viscosity, higher
   heating value and relative density, respectively. Temperature dependency
   was found to be linear for relative density and surface tension yielding
   R-2 values of >.994 and >.97 from linear regression. Viscosity exhibited
   an exponential relationship with temperature. The Andrade equation was
   shown to be the appropriate representation with absolute average
   deviation values <1.25\%. Cloud point, pour point and cold filter
   plugging point were measured. Increasing the concentration of butanol
   decreased the cloud point, pour point, and cold filter plugging point.
   Cloud point and cold filter plugging point experienced the most
   significant change at butanol concentrations <25\%. Values stayed almost
   constant for concentrations beyond that. The pour point continued to
   decrease with increasing butanol concentrations. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{WAVE MOTION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{765-781}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To aid the material identification of tissue anomalies exposed by the
   vibro-acoustography approach to medical imaging that makes use of the
   acoustic radiation force, the focus of this study is an extension of the
   concept of topological sensitivity, originally developed for remote
   sensing applications, to transmission-mode inverse problems in
   elastodynamics where the physical excitation ``taps{''} directly on an
   internal defect. The germane formula for the topological sensitivity is
   obtained by an asymptotic expansion of a misfit-type cost functional
   with respect to the nucleation of an elastic inclusion, at the focal
   point of the acoustic radiation force, in an otherwise defect-free
   reference body. Due to the presence of a body force inside the
   nucleating defect, the underpinning limiting behavior of the
   elastodynamic perturbation is fundamentally different from that
   considered previously in the context of remote sensing, where the
   topological disturbance is by definition free of body forces. Under the
   premise of a ball-shaped nucleating inclusion, the formula for
   topological sensitivity is shown to be expressible in terms of the
   adjoint elastodynamic field and its gradients, contracted with
   sampling-point-independent tensors that are computable from two
   reference elastostatic solutions in R-3. The proposed result is verified
   numerically by comparing the adjoint-field formula with its
   finite-difference approximation, computed for progressively smaller
   trial defects. On the basis of the new expression, a proposition is made
   wherein the variation of topological sensitivity versus the trial shear
   modulus of the nucleating defect at a fixed sampling, i.e. source point
   is capable of revealing (via the location of its infimum) whether the
   lesion, acted upon by a highly localized body force in the physical
   experiment, is ``stiffer{''} or ``softer{''} than the background solid.
   The utility of the idea is supported by a set of numerical results for a
   testing configuration that was motivated by a recent experimental study.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a tactile sensor capable of measuring Young's
   modulus and shear modulus of elasticity for polymers, soft tissue, and
   other materials. The sensor is built by using polydimethylsiloxane as
   the structural material. A number of sensing cells of different
   stiffnesses are used in each sensor. The Young's modulus of the targeted
   object can be measured based on the relative deflections of adjacent
   sensing cells. The shear modulus measurement is enabled by using a
   quad-electrode structure in each sensing cell. Experimental results show
   sensing resolutions of 0.1 MPa for Young's modulus measurement in the
   range of 0.1-1 MPa and 0.05 MPa for shear modulus measurement ranging
   from 0.05 to 0.2 MPa. The flexible tactile sensor can be integrated on
   the end effector of robotic arms to achieve tactile sensing feedback.
   The proposed sensing technology can also be utilized for fast
   measurement of both Young's modulus and shear modulus for industrial
   applications that involve measuring mechanical properties of materials.}},

Title = {{Autothermal reforming of butanol to butenes in a staged millisecond
   reactor: Effect of catalysts and isomers}},
Journal = {{APPLIED CATALYSIS A-GENERAL}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{445}},
Pages = {{35-41}},
Month = {{NOV 28}},
Abstract = {{Dehydration and isomerization of butanol is studied in an autothermal
   short contact-time reactor containing a 1 wt\% Pt stage followed by a
   zeolite or gamma-Al2O3 stage downstream to convert butanol into butenes
   with up to 95\% yield at residence times on the order of 100 ms. CH4 is
   fed as a sacrificial fuel to the Pt stage and butanol is fed between the
   stages to avoid undesired oxidation and reforming reactions of butanol
   over Pt. The energy released by CH4 catalytic partial oxidation drives
   downstream butanol dehydration and isomerization.
   The effect of catalyst is studied by comparing the performance of
   HZSM-5, HFER, and gamma-Al2O3 catalysts. Higher yields (20\%) of butenes
   were obtained with gamma-Al2O3 and HFER than with HZSM-5. The absence of
   Bronsted acid sites in gamma-Al2O3 and the small pore structure of HFER
   lead to reduced yields of large side products such as higher
   hydrocarbons that promote oligomerization reactions. A 95\% butene yield
   is obtained with HFER at temperatures ranging from 280-350 degrees C and
   a 95\% yield with gamma-Al2O3 at temperatures between 320 and 350
   degrees C. Only a 75\% butene yield was obtained with HZSM-5 at 230
   degrees C.
   The effect of hydrocarbon structure on product formation is studied by
   comparing conversions of each butanol isomer using a heated tube reactor
   at temperatures between 200 and 400 degrees C. The reactivity of butanol
   follows as: t-butanol > 2-butanol > iso-butanol > 1-butanol.
   trans-2-Butene and cis-2-butene are primarily formed from linear butanol
   isomers, while isobutene forms from branched butanol isomers.
   Conversions and product distributions of butanol isomers formed over
   HZSM-5 in a staged reactor are comparable (<10\% difference across all
   species) with data using a heated tube reactor at similar temperatures.
   We successfully demonstrate an alternative pathway to dehydrate butanol
   into butenes with an autothermal staged reactor compared to conventional
   methods for applications in small-scale biomass utilization. The largest
   advantage of this reactor is the integration of highly exothermic
   autothermal stage and endothermic alcohol dehydration stage which
   provides an alternative processing technique to maintain the bed
   temperature. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   polydimethylsiloxane and polyether soft segments form tough and easily
   processed thermoplastic elastomers. Two commercially available examples,
   Elast-Eon E2A (denoted as E2A) and PurSil 35 (denoted as P35), were
   evaluated for molecular and mechanical stability after immersion in
   buffered water for up to 52 weeks at temperatures ranging from 37 to 85
   degrees C. Dynamic mechanical spectroscopy experiments, performed in
   tension and shear, were used to characterize the linear viscoelastic
   properties of compression molded (dry) specimens. Small angle X-ray
   scattering measurements indicated a disorganized microphase-separated
   morphology for all test conditions. Upon aging in phosphate buffered
   saline, samples of E2A and P35 were analyzed by size exclusion
   chromatography (SEC) and tensile testing as a function of time and
   temperature. The absolute molar mass of each material prior to aging in
   water was determined by SEC using a multiangle light scattering
   detector. Aging at 85 degrees C and 52 weeks lead to a 67\% and 50\%
   reduction in molar mass from the original values for E2A and P35,
   respectively. We attribute the reduction in molar mass to hydrolysis of
   the polymer backbone and have evaluated the data using a
   pseudo-zero-order kinetics analysis. The temperature dependence of the
   extracted rate data is consistent with an activated (i.e., Arrhenius)
   process, and thus all the molar mass reduction data can be reduced to a
   single master curve. Concomitant with the reduction in molar mass, E2A
   and P35 transformed with aging from strain hardening to strain softening
   materials, characterized by substantially reduced tensile strength
   (stress at failure) and ultimate elongation (strain at failure) relative
   to the original properties.}},

Month = {{NOV 26}},
Abstract = {{Broadband photodetection is achieved by integrating three electron donor
   materials with complementary absorption into an organic photodetector
   (OPD). While a single donor-acceptor heterojunction can show broadband
   response, the spectral tunability is intrinsically limited to the
   absorption profiles of the active materials. Here, we demonstrate
   broadband OPDs consisting of multiple bulk heterojunctions arranged in
   tandem. These OPDs show high responsivity under moderate reverse bias
   from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. By combining materials with
   complementary absorption in a tandem OPD, we demonstrate that the
   response from each band can be separately tuned with manipulation of the
   heterojunction thicknesses or composition. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{Electrical properties of biological tissues are highly sensitive to
   their physiological and pathological status. Thus it is of importance to
   image electrical properties of biological tissues. However, spatial
   resolution of conventional electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is
   generally poor. Recently, hybrid imaging modalities combining electric
   conductivity contrast and ultrasonic resolution based on the
   acousto-electric effect has attracted considerable attention. In this
   study, we propose a novel three-dimensional (3D) noninvasive ultrasound
   Joule heat tomography (UJHT) approach based on the acousto-electric
   effect using unipolar ultrasound pulses. As the Joule heat density
   distribution is highly dependent on the conductivity distribution, an
   accurate and high-resolution mapping of the Joule heat density
   distribution is expected to give important information that is closely
   related to the conductivity contrast. The advantages of the proposed
   ultrasound Joule heat tomography using unipolar pulses include its
   simple inverse solution, better performance than UJHT using common
   bipolar pulses and its independence of a priori knowledge of the
   conductivity distribution of the imaging object. Computer simulation
   results show that using the proposed method, it is feasible to perform a
   high spatial resolution Joule heat imaging in an inhomogeneous
   conductive media. Application of this technique on tumor scanning is
   also investigated by a series of computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Applications of RING in the generation and analysis of complex
   thermochemical reaction networks are presented. Automated generation and
   topological network analysis features in RING allow for: (a)
   constructing reaction networks exhaustively in a rule-based manner, (b)

   parameters, (c) hypothesis and testing of mechanisms by comparing
   pathway results from RING with experimental data, and (d) predicting
   atom-efficient synthetic routes to valuable chemicals from known
   chemistries and commonly available chemicals. Case studies involving
   three chemical systems are used to demonstrate these features in RING:
   (a) acid-catalyzed propane aromatization, (b) glycerol and acetone
   dehydration on acid catalysts, and (c) C-4-C-9 mono-alcohols synthesis
   from C-2 and C-3 oxygenates on acid, base, and metal catalyzed
   chemistries. Through these case studies, we demonstrate that RING can be
   used to postulate mechanisms and predict likely products for a given

Abstract = {{Climate models show that particles formed by nucleation can affect cloud
   cover and, therefore, the earth's radiation budget. Measurements
   worldwide show that nucleation rates in the atmospheric boundary layer
   are positively correlated with concentrations of sulfuric acid vapor.
   However, current nucleation theories do not correctly predict either the
   observed nucleation rates or their functional dependence on sulfuric
   acid concentrations. This paper develops an alternative approach for
   modeling nucleation rates, based on a sequence of acid-base reactions.
   The model uses empirical estimates of sulfuric acid evaporation rates
   obtained from new measurements of neutral molecular clusters. The model
   predicts that nucleation rates equal the sulfuric acid vapor collision
   rate times a prefactor that is less than unity and that depends on the
   concentrations of basic gaseous compounds and preexisting particles.
   Predicted nucleation rates and their dependence on sulfuric acid vapor
   concentrations are in reasonable agreement with measurements from Mexico
   City and Atlanta.}},

Abstract = {{Configurational-bias Monte Carlo (CBMC) simulations in the isobaric
   isothermal version of the Gibbs ensemble (GE) were carried out to probe
   the adsorption from aqueous solutions of methanol and/or ethanol onto
   silicalite-1. This methodology does require neither specification of the
   chemical potential nor any reference to activity models based on
   experimental data. The CBMC-GE methodology can be applied to the
   complete range of mixture compositions from pure water to pure alcohols
   and can also be used when multiple solute types are present at high
   concentration. The simulations demonstrate high selectivities for the
   alcohols (alpha(ethanol) > alpha(methanol)) almost over the entire
   composition range. The ideal adsorbed solution theory is found to
   substantially underpredict the amount of sorbed water and leads to very
   large errors for low alcohol solution concentrations. The simulations
   indicate that, at lower loadings, the adsorbed alcohol molecules can
   serve as seeds for water adsorption but, at higher loadings, alcohols
   displace water molecules from their preferred region.}},

Title = {{Hopping transport and the Hall effect near the insulator-metal
   transition in electrochemically gated poly(3-hexylthiophene) transistors}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Despite 35 years of investigation, much remains to be understood
   regarding charge transport in semiconducting polymers, including the
   ultimate limits on their conductivity. Recently developed ion gel gating
   techniques provide a unique opportunity to study such issues at very
   high charge carrier density. Here we have probed the benchmark polymer
   semiconductor poly(3-hexylthiophene) at electrochemically induced
   three-dimensional hole densities approaching 10(21) cm(-3) (up to 0.2
   holes per monomer). Analysis of the hopping conduction reveals a
   remarkable phenomenon where wavefunction delocalization and Coulomb gap
   collapse are disrupted by doping-induced disorder, suppressing the
   insulator-metal transition, even at these extreme charge densities.
   Nevertheless, at the highest dopings, we observe, for the first time in
   a polymer transistor, a clear Hall effect with the expected field,
   temperature and gate voltage dependencies. The data indicate that at
   such mobilities (similar to 0.8 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1)), despite the extensive
   disorder, these polymers lie close to a regime of truly diffusive
   band-like transport.}},

Title = {{Soft Switching Approach to Reducing Transition Losses in an On/Off
   Hydraulic Valve}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A method for significantly reducing the losses associated with an on/off
   controlled hydraulic system is proposed. There has been a growing
   interest in the use of on/off valves to control hydraulic systems as a
   means of improving system efficiency. While on/off valves are efficient
   when they are fully open or fully closed, a significant amount of energy
   can be lost in throttling as the valve transitions between the two
   states when the switching times are not negligible. A soft switching
   approach is proposed as a method of eliminating the majority of these
   transition losses. The operating principle of soft switching is that
   fluid can temporarily flow through a check valve or into a small chamber
   while valve orifices are partially closed. The fluid can then flow out
   of the chamber once the valve has fully transitioned. Thus, fluid flows
   through the valve only when it is in its most efficient fully open
   state. A model of the system is derived and simulated, with results
   indicating that the soft switching approach can reduce transition and
   compressibility losses by 81\% and total system losses by 64\%. The soft
   switching approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of on/off
   controlled systems and is particularly beneficial as switching
   frequencies are increased. The soft switching approach will also
   facilitate the use of slower on/off valves for effective on/off control;
   in simulation, a valve with soft switching matched the efficiency of an
   on/off valve that was 4.4 times faster. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006620]}},

Title = {{Design, Modeling, and Validation of a High-Speed Rotary
   Pulse-Width-Modulation On/Off Hydraulic Valve}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DYNAMIC SYSTEMS MEASUREMENT AND CONTROL-TRANSACTIONS OF THE
   ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Efficient high-speed on/off valves are an enabling technology for
   applying digital control techniques such as pulse-width-modulation (PWM)
   to hydraulic systems. Virtually variable displacement pumps (VVDPs) are
   one application where variable displacement functionality is attained
   using a fixed-displacement pump paired with an on/off valve and an
   accumulator. High-speed valves increase system bandwidth and reduce
   output pressure ripple by enabling higher switching frequencies. In
   addition to fast switching, on/off valves should also have small
   pressure drop and low actuation power to be effective in these
   applications. In this paper, a new unidirectional rotary valve designed
   for PWM is proposed. The valve is unique in utilizing the hydraulic
   fluid flowing through it as a power source for rotation. An unoptimized
   prototype capable of high flow rate (40 lpm), high speed (2.8 ms
   transition time at 100 Hz PWM frequency), and low pressure drop (0.62
   MPa), while consuming little actuation power (< 0.5\% full power or 30
   W, scavenged from fluid stream), has been constructed and experimentally
   validated. This paper describes the valve design, analyzes its
   performance and losses, and develops mathematical models that can be
   used for design and simulation. The models are validated using
   experimental data from a proof-of-concept prototype. The valve
   efficiency is quantified and suggestions for improving the efficiency in
   future valves are provided. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006621]}},

Abstract = {{The cisco Coregonus artedi is the most common coldwater stenothermal
   fish in Minnesota lakes. To project its chances of survival under future
   warmer climate conditions, an oxythermal habitat variable, i.e., the
   water temperature at 3 mg/L of dissolved oxygen in stratified lakes
   (TDO3) was calculated from simulated daily temperature and DO profiles
   in 30 lake types under past (1962-2008) climate conditions and two
   future climate scenarios. The mean daily TDO3 values over a 31-d fixed
   benchmark period were calculated for each of the simulated years and
   then averaged over the simulation period for each lake type. The
   multiyear average TDO3 was used to identify cisco refuge lakes in
   Minnesota. Six hundred twenty known cisco lakes in Minnesota were
   divided into three groups, tier 1 refuge lakes having the most suitable
   habitat for ciscoes, tier 2 refuge lakes having suitable habitat for
   ciscoes, and tier 3 or nonrefuge lakes supporting ciscoes only at a
   reduced probability of occurrence. The multiyear average TDO3s for tier
   1, 2, and 3 lakes were <= 11 degrees C, 11-17 degrees C, and >17 degrees
   C, respectively. Projected increases in the multiyear average TDO3 under
   the two future climate scenarios averaged 2.6 degrees C to 2.9 degrees
   C. About one-third of the 620 lakes that are known to have cisco
   populations were projected to maintain viable cisco habitat under the
   two future climate scenarios. These lakes have a Secchi depth greater
   than 2.3 m (mesotrophic and oligotrophic lakes) and are seasonally
   stratified.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock facilities have historically generated public concerns due to
   their emissions of odorous air and various chemical pollutants. Odor
   emission factors and identification of principal odorous chemicals are
   needed to better understand the problem. Applications of odor emission
   factors include inputs to odor setback models, while chemical emission
   factors may be compared with regulation thresholds as a means of
   demonstrating potential health impacts. A companion study of the
   National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS) included measurements
   necessary for establishing odor and chemical emission factors for
   confined animal feeding operations. This additional investigation was
   conducted by the University of Minnesota, Iowa State University, West
   Texas A\&M Agri-Life Center, and Purdue University. The objectives were
   to (1) determine odor emission rates across swine and dairy facilities
   and seasons using common protocols and standardized olfactometry
   methods, (2) develop a chemical library of the most significant
   odorants, and (3) correlate the chemical library with the olfactometry
   results. This document describes the sampling and quality assurance
   methods used in the measurement and evaluation of odor and chemical
   samples collected at two freestall dairy farms, one sow
   (gestation/farrowing) facility, and one finishing pig site. Odor samples
   were collected in Tedlar bags and chemical samples were collected in
   sorbent tubes at barn inlet and exhaust locations using the NAEMS
   multiple-location gas sampling systems. Quality assurance protocols
   included interlaboratory comparison tests, which were evaluated to
   identify variations between olfactometry labs. While differences were
   observed, the variations among the labs and samples appeared random and
   the collected odor data were considered reliable at a 0.5\% level of
   statistical significance. Overall, the study took advantage of
   groundbreaking opportunities to collect and associate simultaneous odor
   and chemical information from swine and dairy buildings while
   maintaining accordance with standard methods and comparability across
   laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{This study was an add-on project to the National Air Emissions
   Monitoring Study (NAEMS) and focused on comprehensive measurement of
   odor emissions considering variations in seasons, animal types, and
   olfactometry laboratories. Odor emissions from four of 14 NAEMS sites
   with nine barns/rooms (two dairy barns at the WI5B and IN5B sites, two
   pig finishing rooms at IN3B, and two sow gestation barns and a farrowing
   room at the IA4B site) were measured during four 13-week cycles. Odor
   emissions were reported per barn area (OU h(-1) m(-2)), head (OU h(-1)
   head(-1)), and animal unit (OU h(-1) AU(-1)). The highest overall odor
   emission rates were measured in summer (1.2 x 10(5) OU h(-1) m(-2), 3.5
   x 10(5) OU h(-1) head(-1), and 6.2 x 10(5) OU h(-1) AU(-1)), and the
   lowest rates were measured in winter (2.5 x 10(4) OU h(-1) m(-2), 9.1 x
   10(4) OU h(-1) head(-1), and 1.5 x 10(5) OU h(-1) AU(-1)). The highest
   ambient odor concentrations and barn odor emissions were measured from
   the sow gestation barns of the IA4B site, which had unusually high H2S
   concentrations. The most intense odor and the least pleasant odor were
   also measured at this site. The overall odor emission rates of the pig
   finishing rooms at IN3B were lower than the emission rates of the IA4B
   sow gestation barns. The lowest overall barn odor emission rates were
   measured at the IN5B dairy barns. However, the lowest ambient odor
   concentrations were measured at the ventilation inlets of the WI5B dairy
   barns.}},

Abstract = {{This study supplemented the National Air Emissions Monitoring Study
   (NAEMS) with one year of comprehensive measurements of odor emission at
   five swine and four dairy buildings. The measurements included both
   standard human sensory measurements using dynamic forced-choice
   olfactometry and chemical analysis of the odorous compounds using gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry. In this article, multilinear
   regressions between odor and gas concentrations (a total of 20 compounds
   including H2S, NH3, and VOCs) were investigated. Regressions between
   odor and gas emission rates were also tested. It was found that gas
   concentrations, rather than emission rates, should be used to develop
   multilinear regression models. For the dairy sites, H2S, NH3, acetic
   acid, propanoic acid, 2-methyl propanoic, and pentanoic acids were
   observed to be the compounds with the most significant effect on sensory
   odor For the swine sites, in addition to these gases, higher molecular
   weight compounds such as phenol, 4-methyl phenol, 4-ethyl phenol, and
   1H-indole were also observed to be significant predictors of sensory
   odor When all VOCs were excluded from the model, significant
   correlations between odor and H2S and NH3 concentrations were still
   observed. Although these coefficients of determination were lower when
   only H2S and NH3 were used, they can be used to predict odor variability
   by up to 83\% when VOC data are unavailable.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing concern with air and odor emissions from agricultural
   facilities. A supplementary research project was conducted to complement
   the U.S. National Air Emissions Monitoring Study (NAEMS). The overall
   goal of the project was to establish odor and chemical emission factors
   for animal feeding operations. The study was conducted over a 17-month
   period at two freestall dairies, one swine sow farm, and one swine
   finisher facility. Samples from a representative exhaust airstream at
   each barn were collected in 10 L Tedlar bags and analyzed by trained
   human panelists using dynamic triangular forced-choice olfactometry.
   Samples were simultaneously analyzed for 20 odorous compounds (acetic
   acid, propanoic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, valeric acid,
   isovaleric acid, hexanoic acid, heptanoic acid, guaiacol, phenol,
   4-methylphenol, 4-ethylphenol, 2-aminoacetophenone, indole, skatole,
   dimethyl disulfide, diethyl disulfide, dimethyl trisulfide, hydrogen
   sulfide, and ammonia). In this article, which is part 6 of a six-part
   series summarizing results of the project, we investigate the
   correlations between odor concentrations and odor activity value (OAT),
   defined as the concentration of a single compound divided by the odor
   threshold for that compound The specific objectives were to determine
   which compounds contributed most to the overall odor emanating from
   swine and dairy buildings, and develop equations for predicting odor
   concentration based on compound OAVs. Single-compound odor thresholds
   (SCOT) were statistically summarized and analyzed, and OAVs were
   calculated for all compounds. Odor concentrations were regressed against
   OAV values using multivariate regression techniques. Both swine sites
   had four common compounds with the highest OAVs (ranked high to low:
   hydrogen sulfide, 4-methylphenol, butyric acid, isovaleric acid). The
   dairy sites had these same four compounds in common in the top five, and
   in addition diethyl disulfide was ranked second at one dairy site, while
   ammonia was ranked third at the other dairy site. Summed OAVs were not a
   good predictor of odor concentration (R-2 = 0.16 to 0.52),
   underestimating actual odor concentrations by 2 to 3 times. Based on the
   OAV and regression analyses, we conclude that hydrogen sulfide,
   4-methylphenol, isovaleric acid, ammonia, and diethyl disulfide are the
   most likely contributors to swine odor, while hydrogen sulfide, 4-methyl
   phenol, butyric acid, and isovaleric acid are the most likely
   contributors to dairy odors.}},

Abstract = {{The zebrafish (Danio rerio) is increasingly being used to study basic
   vertebrate biology and human disease with a rich array of in vivo
   genetic and molecular tools. However, the inability to readily modify
   the genome in a targeted fashion has been a bottleneck in the field.
   Here we show that improvements in artificial transcription
   activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) provide a powerful new
   approach for targeted zebrafish genome editing and functional genomic
   applications(1-5). Using the GoldyTALEN modified scaffold and zebrafish
   delivery system, we show that this enhanced TALEN toolkit has a high
   efficiency in inducing locus-specific DNA breaks in somatic and germline
   tissues. At some loci, this efficacy approaches 100\%, including
   biallelic conversion in somatic tissues that mimics phenotypes seen
   using morpholino-based targeted gene knockdowns(6). With this updated
   TALEN system, we successfully used single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides
   to precisely modify sequences at predefined locations in the zebrafish
   genome through homology-directed repair, including the introduction of a
   custom-designed EcoRV site and a modified loxP (mloxP) sequence into
   somatic tissue in vivo. We further show successful germline transmission
   of both EcoRV and mloxP engineered chromosomes. This combined approach
   offers the potential to model genetic variation as well as to generate
   targeted conditional alleles.}},

Abstract = {{The synthesis of hybrid zeolitic materials with complex
   micropore-mesopore structures and morphologies is an expanding area of
   recent interest for a number of applications. Here we report a new type
   of hybrid zeolite material composed of a layered zeolite material grown
   epitaxially on the surface of a bulk zeolite,Material. Specifically;
   layered (2-D) MFI sheets were grown on the surface of bulk MA crystals
   of different sizes (300 nm and 10 mu m), thereby resulting in a hybrid
   Material containing a unique morphology of interconnected micropores
   (similar to 035 nm) and rnesopores (similar to 3 nm). The structure and
   morphology of this material referred to as a ``bulk MFI-layered MFI{''}
   (BMLM) material, was elucidated by a combination of XRD; TEM, HRTEM,
   SEM, TGA, and N-2 physisorption techniques. If is Conclusively shown
   that epitaxial growth of the 2-D layered MFI sheets occurs in at least
   two principal crystallographic directions of the bulk MFI crystal and
   possibly In the third direction as well. The BMLM material combines the
   properties of bulk MFI (micropore network and mechanical support) and
   2-D layered MFI (large surface roughness, external surface area, and
   mesoporosity). As an example of the uses of the BMLM material, it was
   incorporated into a polyimide and fabricated into a composite membrane
   with enhanced permeability for CO2 and good CO2/CH4 selectivity for gas
   separations. SEM-EDX imaging and composition analysis showed that the
   polyimide and the BMLM interpenetrate into each other, thereby forming a
   well-adhered polymer/particle microstructure, in contrast with the
   defective Interfacial microstructure Obtained using bare MFI particles.
   Analysis of the gas permeation data with the modified Maxwell model also
   allows the estimation of the effective volume of the BMLM particles, as
   well as the CO2 and CH4 gas permeabilities of the interpenetrated layer
   at the BMLWpolyimicle Interface.}},

Abstract = {{While the presence of axial-screw dislocations in helical nanowires and
   nanotubes is known to be due to the growth process, their effect on the
   electronic properties remains unexplored. Relying on objective molecular
   dynamics simulations coupled to density functional tight binding models
   for ZnO and Si, and supporting density functional theory Calculations,
   We predict significant screw-dislocation-induced band gap modifications
   in both materials. The effect originates in the highly distorted cores
   and should be present at radii larger than those considered in our
   simulations (maximum similar to 2 nm) as well as In other materials. The
   observed band gap dependences on the size of the Burgers vector and wall
   thickness could motivate new strategies for growing, via the screw
   dislocation mechanism, stable nanostructures with desired band gaps}},

Abstract = {{A systematic procedure for the design and evaluation of a taxi-route
   conformance-monitoring system is presented. Specifically, two levels of
   solution algorithms are designed for two different granularities of a
   complete surface taxi-route conformance-monitoring problem. The
   macrolevel solutions focus on route identification in which aircraft are
   assumed to move within the specified taxiways and can only be on one
   route segment at any given time. The route segment that an aircraft is
   moving on is then uniquely determined based on a graph model of the
   airport structure. In comparison, the microlevel solutions identify both
   lateral position deviation and route deviation to determine if an
   aircraft stays within the specified taxiways and which routes it is on.
   It can detect the simultaneous occupancies of an aircraft on multiple
   route segments at a given time, such as during turns. For the
   microsolutions, the airport surface is described by a set of geometric
   shapes. Furthermore, frameworks for applying these algorithms in the
   presence of uncertainties are developed. Extensive numerical simulations
   are used to evaluate the performances of the proposed algorithms.}},

Title = {{Idealized numerical simulation of breaking water wave propagating over a
   viscous mud layer}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulation and large-eddy simulation are developed to
   investigate water waves propagating over viscous fluid mud at the
   bottom, with a focus on the study of wave breaking case. In the
   simulations, the water surface and the water mud interface are captured
   with a coupled level-set and volume-of-fluid method. For non-breaking
   water waves of finite amplitude, it is found that the overall wave decay
   rate is in agreement with the existing linear theory. For breaking water
   waves, detailed description of the instantaneous flow field is obtained
   from the simulation. The time history of the total mechanical energy in
   water and mud shows that during the early stage of the wave breaking,
   the energy decays slowly; then, the energy decays rapidly; and finally,
   the decay rate of energy becomes small again. Statistics of the total
   mechanical energy indicates that the mud layer reduces the wave breaking
   intensity and shortens the breaking duration significantly. The effect
   of mud on the energy dissipation also induces a large amount of energy
   left in the system after the wave breaking. To obtain a better
   understanding of the underlying mechanism, energy transport in water and
   mud is analyzed in detail. A study is then performed on the viscous
   dissipation and the energy transfer at the water mud interface. It is
   found that during the wave breaking, the majority of energy is lost at
   the water surface as well as through the viscous dissipation in mud. The
   energy and viscous dissipation in mud and the energy transfer at the
   water mud interface are strongly affected by the wave breaking at the
   water surface. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Computational study and modeling of turbine spacing effects in infinite
   aligned wind farms}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We study the turbine spacing effects in infinite, aligned wind-turbine
   arrays using large-eddy simulation (LES) with the wind turbine rotors
   parameterized as actuator disks. A series of simulations is carried out
   to systematically investigate the different effects of streamwise and
   spanwise turbine spacings on the array power output and turbulence
   intensities. We show that for the same turbine density, increasing the
   streamwise spacing is more beneficial than increasing the spanwise
   spacing. Larger streamwise turbine spacing increases the power
   extraction and lowers the turbulence intensity at each turbine more
   efficiently than when the spanwise turbine spacing is increased. The
   reason for the different effects of streamwise and spanwise turbine
   spacings on wind farm performance is that the wake recovery of wind
   turbines in infinite arrays depends on the area influenced by the
   wind-turbine wakes, rather than the land area occupied by each turbine.
   Based on this idea, an improved effective roughness height model is
   proposed, which can account for the different effects of streamwise and
   spanwise turbine spacings in infinite aligned wind farms. The predictive
   capabilities of the new model are demonstrated via extensive comparisons
   with results obtained from the LES and previously proposed roughness
   height models. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Microwave assisted catalytic pyrolysis was investigated to convert
   Douglas fir pellets to bio-oils by a ZSM-5 zeolite catalyst. A central
   composite experimental design (CCD) was used to optimize the catalytic
   pyrolysis process. The effects of reaction time, temperature and
   catalyst to biomass ratio on the bio-oil, syngas, and biochar yields
   were determined. GC/MS analysis results showed that the bio-oil
   contained a series of important and useful chemical compounds. Phenols,
   guaiacols, and aromatic hydrocarbons were the most abundant compounds
   which were about 50-82\% in bio-oil depending on the pyrolysis
   conditions. Comparison between the bio-oils from microwave pyrolysis
   with and without catalyst showed that the catalyst increased the content
   of aromatic hydrocarbons and phenols. A reaction pathway was proposed
   for microwave assisted catalyst pyrolysis of Douglas fir pellets. (C)

Abstract = {{Enzyme-based smart materials constitute a rapidly growing group of
   functional materials. Often the natively evolved enzymes are not
   compatible with hydrophobic synthetic materials, thus significantly
   limiting the performance of enzymes. This work investigates the use of a
   polyethylene glycol (PEG)-conjugated detergent enzyme for self-cleaning
   coatings. As a result, PEG conjugated a-amylase demonstrated a much more
   homogeneous distribution in polyurethane coatings than the parent native
   enzyme as detected by both fluorescent microscopy and scanning electron
   microscopy (SEM) equipped with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy
   (SEM-EDX). Additionally, the conjugated enzyme showed enhanced retention
   in the coating and much improved thermal stability with a halflife of 20
   days detected at 80 degrees C and over 350 days under room temperature.
   Such coating-incorporated enzyme afforded interesting self-cleaning
   functionality against starch-based stains as examined through a slipping
