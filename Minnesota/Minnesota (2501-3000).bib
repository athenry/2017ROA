Abstract = {{In revenue management research and practice, demand models are used that
   describe how demand for a seller's products depends on the decisions,
   such as prices, of that seller. Even in settings where the demand for a
   seller's products also depends on decisions of other sellers, the models
   often do not explicitly account for such decisions. It has been
   conjectured in the revenue management literature that such monopoly
   models may incorporate the effects of competition, because the parameter
   estimates of the monopoly models are based on data collected in the
   presence of competition. In this paper we take a closer look at such a
   setting to investigate the behavior of parameter estimates and decisions
   if monopoly models are used in the presence of competition. We consider
   repeated pricing games in which two competing sellers use mathematical
   models to choose the prices of their products. Over the sequence of
   games, each seller attempts to estimate the values of the parameters of
   a demand model that expresses demand as a function only of its own price
   using data comprised only of its own past prices and demand
   realizations. We analyze the behavior of the sellers' parameter
   estimates and prices under various assumptions regarding the sellers'
   knowledge and estimation procedures, and we identify situations in which
   (a) the sellers' prices converge to the Nash equilibrium associated with
   knowledge of the correct demand model, (b) the sellers' prices converge
   to the cooperative solution, and (c) the sellers' prices have many
   potential limit points that are neither the Nash equilibrium nor the
   cooperative solution and that depend on the initial conditions. We
   compare the sellers' revenues at potential limit prices with their
   revenues at the Nash equilibrium and the cooperative solution, and we
   show that it is possible for sellers to be better off when using a
   monopoly model than at the Nash equilibrium.}},

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{210-233}},
Abstract = {{The MBI (maximum block improvement) method is a greedy approach to
   solving optimization problems where the decision variables can be
   grouped into a finite number of blocks. Assuming that optimizing over
   one block of variables while fixing all others is relatively easy, the
   MBI method updates the block of variables corresponding to the maximally
   improving block at each iteration, which is arguably a most natural and
   simple process to tackle block-structured problems with great potentials
   for engineering applications. In this paper we establish global and
   local linear convergence results for this method. The global convergence
   is established under the Lojasiewicz inequality assumption, while the
   local analysis invokes second-order assumptions. We study in particular
   the tensor optimization model with spherical constraints. Conditions for
   linear convergence of the famous power method for computing the maximum
   eigenvalue of a matrix follow in this framework as a special case. The
   condition is interpreted in various other forms for the rank-one tensor
   optimization model under spherical constraints. Numerical experiments
   are shown to support the convergence property of the MBI method.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, single-step synthesis of DME from syngas on bifunctional

   investigated. Various characterization techniques were used to determine
   the structure, reducibility, and surface acidity of the catalysts. The
   experimental results showed that the zeolite type had great influence on
   the activity, selectivity and stability of the bifunctional catalyst
   during the syngas-to-DME process. Zeolite properties including density
   of weak and strong acid sites, pore structure, and Si/Al distribution
   were found to affect the CO conversion and DME selectivity of the
   bifunctional catalyst. In addition, the deactivation of the bifunctional
   catalyst could be attributed to the sintering of metallic Cu and a loss
   of the zeolite dehydration activity.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to develop a novel lipid-polymer hybrid
   drug carrier comprised of folate (FA) modified lipid-shell and
   polymer-core nanoparticles (FLPNPs) for sustained, controlled, and
   targeted delivery of paclitaxel (PTX). The core-shell NPs consist of 1)
   a poly(e-caprolactone) hydrophobic core based on self-assembly of
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-poly( ethylene
   glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL-PEG-PCL) amphiphilic copolymers,
   2) a lipid monolayer formed with
   1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-{[}methoxy
   (polyethylene glycol)-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000), 3) a targeting ligand (FA)
   on the surface, and were prepared using a thin-film hydration and
   ultrasonic dispersion method. Transmission electron microscopy and
   dynamic light scattering analysis confirmed the coating of the lipid
   monolayer on the hydrophobic polymer core. Physicochemical
   characterizations of PTX-loaded FLPNPs, such as particle size and size
   distribution, zeta potential, morphology, drug loading content,
   encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro drug release, were also
   evaluated. Fluorescent microscopy proved the internalization efficiency
   and targeting ability of the folate conjugated on the lipid monolayer
   for the EMT6 cancer cells which overexpress folate receptor. In vitro
   cytotoxicity assay demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of PTX-loaded
   FLPNPs was lower than that of Taxol (R), but higher than that of
   PTX-loaded LPNPs (without folate conjugation). In EMT6 breast tumor
   model, intratumoral administration of PTX-loaded FLPNPs showed similar
   antitumor efficacy but low toxicity compared to Taxol (R). More
   importantly, PTX-loaded FLPNPs showed greater tumor growth inhibition
   (65.78\%) than the nontargeted PTX-loaded LPNPs (48.38\%) (P<0.05).
   These findings indicated that the PTX loaded-FLPNPs with mixed lipid
   monolayer shell and biodegradable polymer core would be a promising
   nanosized drug formulation for tumor-targeted therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past two decades or so, there have been many advances in the
   numerical simulation of hypersonic flows, with most effort focused on
   the development of upwind methods to produce accurate heat transfer
   rates for steady-state laminar and turbulent flows. With parallelizable
   implicit methods, it is now possible to obtain full-vehicle solutions at
   reasonable computational cost. This paper reviews several of the most
   widely used approaches and discusses how the methods have been tuned to
   control numerical errors for strongly shocked flows. The paper also
   discusses recent methods from the incompressible turbulence simulation
   literature that have been adapted to compressible flows. These methods
   have dramatically lower levels of numerical dissipation and have been
   extended to high-order accuracy on smoothly varying hexahedral grids.
   The increased accuracy of these methods enables the solution of complex
   physics unsteady hypersonic flows.}},

Abstract = {{An optimization routine using computational fluid dynamics is outlined
   and applied to axisymmetric aeroshells in hypersonic entry conditions.
   Two objectives are considered in the optimization: minimizing the peak
   heat flux at the wall and maximizing the drag coefficient. These
   objectives are scaled and combined into a single scalar quantity called
   the objective function. A weight is applied to each objective to study
   the tradeoff effect that the objectives have on the shape. A Pareto
   front is produced by varying the weight between 0 and 1 and plotting the
   optimal shapes. Pareto fronts are generated in three environments:
   laminar perfect gas air, turbulent perfect gas air, and a nine-species
   Mars environment. The optimal aeroshells are compared with the Mars
   Science Laboratory aeroshell. The optimal aeroshells generated in the
   two perfect gas air environments compare similarly with the Mars Science
   Laboratory aeroshell. The optimal aeroshells generated in the Mars
   atmosphere show significant deviations from the Mars Science Laboratory
   aeroshell. Significant reductions in heat flux and small increases in
   drag coefficient are seen from the optimal aeroshells. These optimal
   aeroshells are spherical Apollo-like aeroshells.}},

Abstract = {{Incomplete LU factorization (ILU) techniques are a well-known class of
   preconditioners, often used in conjunction with Krylov accelerators for
   the iterative solution of linear systems of equations. However, for
   certain problems, ILU factorizations can yield factors that are unstable
   and in some cases quite dense. Reordering techniques based on permuting
   the matrix prior to performing the factorization have been shown to
   improve the quality of the factorization, and the resulting
   preconditioner. In this paper, we examine the effect of reordering
   techniques based on multilevel graph coarsening ideas on one-level ILU
   factorizations, such as the level-based ILU(k) or the dual threshold
   ILUT algorithms. We consider an aggregation-based coarsening idea that
   implements two main coarsening frameworks-a top-down approach, and a
   bottom-up approach-each utilizing one of two different strategies to
   select the next-level coarse graph. Numerical results are presented to
   support our findings.}},

Abstract = {{The single cell gel electrophoresis assay, also known as the comet
   assay, is a versatile method for measuring many classes of DNA damage,
   including base damage, abasic sites, single strand breaks and double
   strand breaks. However, limited throughput and difficulties with
   reproducibility have limited its utility, particularly for clinical and
   epidemiological studies. To address these limitations, we created a
   microarray comet assay. The use of a micrometer scale array of cells
   increases the number of analysable comets per square centimetre and
   enables automated imaging and analysis. In addition, the platform is
   compatible with standard 24- and 96-well plate formats. Here, we have
   assessed the consistency and sensitivity of the microarray comet assay.
   We showed that the linear detection range for H2O2-induced DNA damage in
   human lymphoblastoid cells is between 30 and 100 mu M, and that within
   this range, inter-sample coefficient of variance was between 5 and 10\%.
   Importantly, only 20 comets were required to detect a statistically
   significant induction of DNA damage for doses within the linear range.
   We also evaluated sample-to-sample and experiment-to-experiment
   variation and found that for both conditions, the coefficient of
   variation was lower than what has been reported for the traditional
   comet assay. Finally, we also show that the assay can be performed using
   a 4x objective (rather than the standard 10x objective for the
   traditional assay). This adjustment combined with the microarray format
   makes it possible to capture more than 50 analysable comets in a single
   image, which can then be automatically analysed using in-house software.
   Overall, throughput is increased more than 100-fold compared to the
   traditional assay. Together, the results presented here demonstrate key
   advances in comet assay technology that improve the throughput,
   sensitivity, and robustness, thus enabling larger scale clinical and
   epidemiological studies.}},

Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{115-125}},
Abstract = {{We study the aggregation of monomers in an aerosol via non-dimensional
   Langevin simulations, in which particles remain in point contact upon
   collision, and report the hydrodynamic radii and projected areas of the
   formed aggregates with less than 300 primary particles. Unique from
   prior studies, in examining aggregation we monitor the evolution of the
   distributions of two Knudsen numbers: the traditional Knudsen number
   (Kn) and the diffusive Knudsen number (Kn(D)), which both shift to
   smaller mean values as aggregation proceeds. As Kn transitions from
   large to small values, momentum transfer changes from a free molecular
   to a continuum process; analogously, as KnD decreases, aggregation is
   altered from occurring ballistically to diffusively in a dilute system.
   During simulations, the change in drag coefficient with both changing Kn
   and changing aggregate structure is accounted for. We find that as
   compared to completely coalescing particles (spheres), non-coalescing
   aggregates with the same initial Kn and Kn(D) have Kn(D) values, which
   decrease more rapidly due to aggregation; hence, aggregates are more
   likely to collide with one another diffusively when compared with their
   spherical counterparts of the same Kn distribution. Further, we find
   that aggregation with evolving Knudsen numbers does not lead to strong
   scaling between the number of monomers in a formed aggregate and the
   aggregate radius of gyration for aggregates composed of 300 or fewer
   primary particles. In spite of this, aggregate hydrodynamic radii and
   orientationally averaged projected areas are found to scale well with
   the number of monomers per aggregate.}},

Abstract = {{We present quantitative, spectroscopic polarization interferometry phase
   measurements on plasmonic surfaces for sensing applications. By adding a
   liquid crystal variable wave plate in our beam path, we are able to
   measure phase shifts due to small refractive index changes on the sensor

   demonstrate real-time measurements. While this optical technique is
   applicable to different sensor geometries-e.g., nanoparticles,
   nanogratings, or nano-apertures-the plasmonic sensors we use here
   consist of an ultrasmooth gold layer with buried linear gratings. Using
   these devices and our phase measurement technique, we calculate a figure
   of merit that shows improvement over measuring only surface plasmon
   resonance shifts from a reflected intensity spectrum. To demonstrate the
   general-purpose versatility of our phase-resolved measurements, we also
   show numerical simulations with another common device architecture:
   periodic plasmonic slits. Since our technique inherently measures both
   the intensity and phase of the reflected or transmitted light
   simultaneously, quantitative sensor device characterization is possible.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{47-56}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Recent empirical studies have shown clear evidence that wireless links
   are not independent and that the packet receptions on adjacent wireless
   links are correlated. This finding contradicts the widely held
   link-independence assumption in the calculation of the core metric,
   i.e., the expected number of transmissions to the candidate forwarder
   set, in opportunistic routing (OR). The inappropriate assumption may
   cause serious estimation errors in the forwarder set selection, which
   further leads to underutilized diversity benefits or extra scheduling
   costs. We thus advocate that OR should be made aware of link
   correlation. In this paper, we propose a novel link-correlation-aware OR
   scheme, which significantly improves the performance by exploiting the
   diverse low correlated forwarding links. We evaluate the design in a
   real-world setting with 24 MICAz nodes. Testbed evaluation and extensive
   simulation show that higher link correlation leads to fewer diversity
   benefits and that, with our link-correlation-aware design, the number of
   transmissions is reduced by 38\%.}},

Title = {{On Synergistic Integration of Adaptive Dithering Based Internal Model
   Control for Hysteresis Compensation in Piezoactuated Nanopositioner}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{Piezoelectric-stack actuated platforms are very popular in the parlance
   of nanopositioning with myriad applications like micro/nanofactory,
   atomic force microscopy, scanning probe microscopy, wafer design,
   biological cell manipulation, and so forth. Motivated by the necessity
   to improve trajectory tracking in such applications, this paper
   addresses the problem of rate dependent hysteretic nonlinearity in
   piezoelectric actuators (PEA). The classical second order Dahl model for
   hysteresis encapsulation is introduced first, followed by the
   identification of parameters through particle swarm optimization. A
   novel inversion based feedforward mechanism in combination with a
   feedback compensator is proposed to achieve high-precision tracking
   wherein the paradoxical concept of noise as a performance enhancer is
   introduced in the realm of PZAs. Having observed that dither induced
   stochastic resonance in the presence of periodic forcing reduces
   tracking error, dither capability is further explored in conjunction
   with a novel output harmonics based adaptive control scheme. The
   proposed adaptive controller is then augmented with an internal model
   control based approach to impart robustness against parametric
   variations and external disturbances. The proposed control law has been
   employed to track multifrequency signals with consistent compensation of
   rate dependent hysteresis of the PEA. The results indicate a greatly
   improved positioning accuracy along with considerable robustness
   achieved with the proposed integrated approach even for dual axis
   tracking applications.}},

Title = {{A bead-spring model for running and tumbling of flagellated swimmers:
   detailed predictions compared to experimental data for E-coli}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{1572-1581}},
Abstract = {{To study the swimming of the multi-flagellated bacterium Escherichia
   coli, we deploy a bead-spring hydrodynamic model (Watari and Larson
   2010), whose body and flagellar geometry, motor torques, and motor
   reversals are adjusted to match the experimental observations of the
   Berg group (Turner et al. 2000; Darnton et al. 2007) during both running
   and tumbling of the bacterium. In this model, hydrodynamic interactions,
   which drive swimming, flagellar bundling, and unbundling during swimming
   and tumbling, are imposed by treating the beads as Stokeslets, imposing
   torques and counter-torques on the body and flagellum at the flexible
   joint connecting them to represent the action of motor, and using the
   Rotne-Prager tensor to model their hydrodynamic interactions with other
   beads. We explore the behavior of coarse-grained (60-bead) and refined
   (120-bead) versions of the model, and show that predictions of running
   speed, helical and body rotation rates, body wobble rates and angles,
   average tumbling angles, range of tumbling angles, and flagellar
   re-bundling times are in good agreement with experimental observations
   by Berg and coworkers. We find that variation in tumbling angle arises
   from variation in flagellar number and location on the bacterial body,
   variations in polymorphic transitions of the filaments, and especially
   from variations in the duration of the tumbling time, which is roughly
   linearly correlated with tumbling time up to tumbling angles of around
   40-50 degrees and more weakly thereafter. The accuracy of the model
   suggests its usefulness for future studies of swimming of other
   flagellated swimmers, for predictions of collective phenomena, and for
   tuning parameters of coarsergrained swimmer models to achieve greater
   realism.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations are performed on a spherical capsule model based

   is at Mach 6.4, and a case with an angle of attack of 28 deg is
   considered. The interest is in predictions of afterbody heating in the
   presence of massive separation and the resultant highly unsteady wake
   flow. Detached-eddy simulations of this flowfield are done using several
   flux schemes, and the effect of mesh refinement is considered. The
   results are compared to experimental data for mean and fluctuating heat
   transfer in the separated portion of the afterbody. Comparisons of
   instantaneous flow features are presented to illustrate varying levels

   reaction time coincides with the rapid formation of branched alpha(1 ->

   of beta(1 -> 4) glucan oligomers. Co-impregnation of glucose was crucial
   for the rapid formation of the alpha(1 -> 6) branches, after which a
   carbon-based catalyst can rapidly hydrolyze the water-soluble glucan

   poly(6-O-vinyladipoyl-D-galactose-ss-N-vinylcaprolactam-ss-methacrylic

   transesterification and emulsion copolymerization for intracellular drug
   delivery. The nanogel exhibited redox, pH and temperature-responsive
   properties, which can be adjusted by varying the monomer feeding ratio.
   Furthermore, the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT) of the
   nanogels was close to body temperature and can result in rapid thermal
   gelation at 37 degrees C. Scanning electron microscopy also revealed
   that the P(ODGal-VCL-MAA) nanogel showed uniform spherical
   monodispersion. With pyrene as a probe, the fluorescence excitation
   spectra demonstrated nanogel degradation in response to glutathione
   (GSH). X-ray diffraction (XRD) showed an amorphous property of DOX
   within the nanogel, which was used in this study as a model anti-cancer
   drug. Drug-releasing characteristics of the nanogel were examined in
   vitro. The results showed multi-responsiveness of DOX release by the
   variation of environmental pH values, temperature or the availability of
   GSH, a biological reductase. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay showed a
   higher anti-tumor activity of the galactose-functionalized DOX-loaded
   nanogels against human hepatoma HepG2 cells, which was, at least in
   part, due to specific binding between the galactose segments and the
   asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGP-Rs) in hepatic cells. Confocal laser
   scanning microscopy (CLSM) and flow cytometric profiles further
   confirmed elevated cellular uptake of DOX by the
   galactose-functionalised nanogels. Thus, we report here a
   multi-responsive P(ODGal-VCL-MAA) nanogel with a hepatoma-specific
   targeting ability for anti-cancer drug delivery.}},

Title = {{Surface passivation of a photonic crystal band-edge laser by atomic

Journal = {{NANOSCALE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{3565-3571}},
Abstract = {{We report on the conformal surface passivation of photonic crystal (PC)
   laser devices with an ultrathin dielectric layer. Air-bridge-type
   Gamma-point band-edge lasers (BELs) are fabricated by forming a
   honeycomb lattice two-dimensional PC structure into an InGaAsP
   multiple-quantum-well epilayer. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is
   employed for conformal deposition of a few-nanometer-thick SiO2 layer
   over the entire device surface, not only on the top and bottom surfaces
   of the air-bridge membrane but also on the air-hole sidewalls. Despite
   its extreme thinness, the ALD passivation layer is found to protect the
   InGaAsP BEL devices from harsh chemicals. In addition, the ALD-SiO2 is
   compatible with the silane-based surface chemistry, which allows us to
   use ALD-passivated BEL devices as label-free biosensors. The standard
   streptavidin-biotin interaction shifts the BEL lasing wavelength by
   similar to 1 nm for the dipole-like Gamma-point band-edge mode. A sharp
   lasing line (<0.2 nm, full width at half-maximum) and a large refractive
   index sensitivity (similar to 163 nm per RIU) produce a figure of merit
   as high as similar to 800 for our BEL biosensor, which is at least an
   order of magnitude higher than those of more common biosensors that rely
   on a broad resonance peak, showing that our nanolaser structures are
   suitable for highly sensitive biosensor applications.}},

Title = {{Lateralization and localization of epilepsy related hemodynamic foci
   using presurgical fMRI}},
Journal = {{CLINICAL NEUROPHYSIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{126}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-38}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Objective: The aim was to develop a method for the purpose of localizing
   epilepsy related hemodynamic foci for patients suffering intractable
   focal epilepsy using task-free fMRI alone.
   Methods: We studied three groups of subjects: patients with intractable
   focal epilepsy, healthy volunteers performing motor tasks, and healthy
   volunteers in resting state. We performed spatial independent component
   analysis (ICA) on the fMRI alone data and developed a set of IC
   selection criteria to identify epilepsy related ICs. The method was then
   tested in the two healthy groups.
   Results: In seven out of the nine surgery patients, identified ICs were
   concordant with surgical resection. Our results were also consistent
   with presurgical evaluation of the remaining one patient without surgery
   and may explain why she was not suitable for resection treatment. In the
   motor task study of ten healthy subjects, our method revealed components
   with concordant spatial and temporal features as expected from the
   unilateral motor tasks. In the resting state study of seven healthy
   subjects, the method successfully rejected all components in four out of
   seven subjects as non-epilepsy related components.
   Conclusion: These results suggest the lateralization and localization
   value of fMRI alone in presurgical evaluation for patients with

Abstract = {{We have combined atomic layer lithography and template stripping to
   produce a new class of substrates for surface-enhanced infrared
   absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy. Our structure consists of a buried and
   U-shaped metalinsulatormetal waveguide whose folded vertical arms
   efficiently couple normally incident light. The insulator is formed by
   atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Al2O3 and precisely defines the gap
   size. The buried nanocavities are protected from contamination by a
   silicon template until ready for use and exposed by template stripping
   on demand. The exposed nanocavity generates strong infrared resonances,
   tightly confines infrared radiation into a gap that is as small as 3 nm
   (lambda/3300), and creates a dense array of millimeter-long hotspots.
   After partial removal of the insulators, the gaps are backfilled with
   benzenethiol molecules, generating distinct Fano resonances due to
   strong coupling with gap plasmons, and a SEIRA enhancement factor of
   10(5) is observed for a 3 nm gap. Because of the wafer-scale
   manufacturability, single-digit-nanometer control of the gap size via
   ALD, and long-term storage enabled by template stripping, our buried
   plasmonic nanocavity substrates will benefit broad applications in
   sensing and spectroscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of semiconducting materials with inert or dangling
   bond-free surfaces has created opportunities to form van der Waals
   heterostructures without the constraints of traditional epitaxial
   growth. For example, layered two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors have
   been incorporated into heterostructure devices with gate-tunable
   electronic and optical functionalities. However, 2D materials present
   processing challenges that have prevented these heterostructures from
   being produced with sufficient scalability and/or homogeneity to enable
   their incorporation into large-area integrated circuits. Here, we extend
   the concept of van der Waals heterojunctions to semiconducting p-type
   single-walled carbon nanotube (s-SWCNT) and n-type amorphous indium
   gallium zinc oxide (a-IGZO) thin films that can be solution-processed or
   sputtered with high spatial uniformity at the wafer scale. The resulting
   large-area, low-voltage pn heterojunctions exhibit antiambipolar
   transfer characteristics with high on/off ratios that are well-suited
   for electronic, optoelectronic, and telecommunication technologies.}},

Abstract = {{The main purpose of this study was to identify the educational needs of
   forest products industries in the Northern Great Lakes region of the US
   and the gaps with existing postsecondary educational opportunities in
   the same region. A combination of interviews with educational program
   representatives and a survey of industry in the mentioned region was
   used to meet the study's objectives. Eighteen currently active
   postsecondary educational programs with degrees specific to the forest
   products industry were identified, and representatives of 13 were
   interviewed for this study. In the second phase of the study, 59 forest
   product companies in the region were surveyed to identify their
   educational needs and a weighted discrepancy score was calculated to
   measure the educational needs for specific competencies. Most
   educational programs expect steady to slightly increasing student
   numbers during the next 5 yr. ``Advisory committees{''} was the most
   commonly cited method to gather industry needs. Schools identified
   advanced manufacturing skills as an important industry need along with
   sustainability and energy efficiency. From the industry survey, a list
   of 21 specific competencies in six functional areas with the most need
   of addressing is provided, including log and lumber grading, customer
   relationship management, basic computer skills, quality control and
   improvement, lumber drying, and safety, among others. Primary
   processing-related skills were found to be in particular need of
   attention by educational programs in the region. Industries reported
   having the most difficulty finding employees with the proper education
   for shop floor and production management positions.}},

Abstract = {{Background aims. Current methods of mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC)
   cryopreservation result in variable post-thaw recovery and phenotypic
   changes caused by freezing. The objective of this investigation was to
   determine the influence of ex vivo cell expansion on phenotype of MSCs
   and the response of resulting phenotypes to freezing and thawing.
   Methods. Human bone marrow aspirate was used. MSCs were isolated and
   cells were assessed for total count, viability, apoptosis and senescence
   over 6 passages (8-10 doublings/passage) in ex vivo culture. One half of
   cells harvested at each passage were replated for continued culture and
   the other half were frozen at 1 degrees C/min in a controlled-rate
   freezer. Frozen samples were stored in liquid nitrogen, thawed and
   reassessed for total cell count, viability and senescence immediately
   and 48 h after thaw. Results. Viability did not differ significantly
   between samples before freeze or after thaw. Senescence increased over
   time in pre-freeze culture and was significantly higher in one sample
   that had growth arrest both before freeze and after thaw. Freezing
   resulted in similar initial post-thaw recovery in all samples, but 48-h
   post-thaw growth arrest was observed in the sample with high senescence
   only. Conclusions. High pre-freeze senescence appears to correlate with
   poor post-thaw function in MSC samples, but additional studies are
   necessary to obtain a sample sizes large enough to quantify results.}},

Journal = {{Nature Communications}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Zeolites play numerous important roles in modern petroleum refineries
   and have the potential to advance the production of fuels and chemical
   feedstocks from renewable resources. The performance of a zeolite as
   separation medium and catalyst depends on its framework structure. To
   date, 213 framework types have been synthesized and >330,000
   thermodynamically accessible zeolite structures have been predicted.
   Hence, identification of optimal zeolites for a given application from
   the large pool of candidate structures is attractive for accelerating
   the pace of materials discovery. Here we identify, through a
   large-scale, multi-step computational screening process, promising
   zeolite structures for two energy-related applications: the purification
   of ethanol from fermentation broths and the hydroisomerization of
   alkanes with 18-30 carbon atoms encountered in petroleum refining. These
   results demonstrate that predictive modelling and data-driven science
   can now be applied to solve some of the most challenging separation
   problems involving highly non-ideal mixtures and highly articulated
   compounds.}},

Volume = {{72}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{37-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In celebration of the first 60 years of the Air Force Office of
   Scientific Research, several studies of hypersonic flows dominated by
   rate-dependent energetic processes are revisited. The work presented
   shows the evolution and advancement of computational capabilities in
   this area, and illustrates some key lessons learned over the previous
   decade or so. Early work with Leyva and Hornung in the California
   Institute of Technology T5 Free-Piston Shock Tunnel had the goal of
   validating thermochemical models for high-enthalpy flows. Several of
   these flows are re-analyzed with more advanced numerical methods,
   resulting in improved comparisons with the experimental measurements.
   This work was followed by a series of experiments in the
   Calspan-University at Buffalo Research Center (now CUBRC Inc.)
   facilities at lower enthalpy conditions. Initial comparisons were poor,
   but with a better understanding of the facility behavior and the
   inclusion of key finite-rate processes, excellent agreement was obtained
   for nitrogen flows. An interesting study related to plasmadynamics and
   finite-rate processes in a different type of flow is discussed. Finally,
   it is shown that recent advances in numerical methods that are beginning
   to enable the direct numerical simulation of key rate-dependent
   energetic processes in hypersonic flows. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The direct simulation Monte Carlo method (DSMC) has evolved over 50
   years into a powerful numerical technique for the computation of
   thermochemical nonequilibrium gas flows. In this context, nonequilibrium
   means that velocity and internal energy distribution functions are not
   in equilibrium forms due to a low number of intermolecular collisions
   within a fluid element. In hypersonic flow, nonequilibrium conditions
   occur at high altitude and in regions of flow fields with small length
   scales. This article highlights significant developments in particle
   simulation methods (since 2001) applied specifically to hypersonic
   flows, which now includes Molecular Dynamics in addition to DSMC.
   Experimental measurements that have led directly to improved DSMC models
   will be highlighted. Algorithm development for DSMC aimed at increasing
   computational efficiency is discussed with a focus on hybrid
   particle-continuum methods. New research that applies all-atom Molecular
   Dynamics simulation and trajectory-based DSMC simulation to normal shock
   waves is summarized. Finally, a discussion of state-resolved DSMC
   modeling is included with reference to future prospects for particle
   simulation methods and in particular for the DSMC method. (C) 2014

Volume = {{137}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the modeling and control for a novel Compressed Air
   Energy Storage (CAES) system for wind turbines. The system captures
   excess power prior to electricity generation so that electrical
   components can be downsized for demand instead of supply. Energy is
   stored in a high pressure dual chamber liquid-compressed air storage
   vessel. It takes advantage of the power density of hydraulics and the
   energy density of pneumatics in the ``open accumulator{''} architecture.
   A liquid piston air compressor/expander is utilized to achieve
   near-isothermal compression/expansion for efficient operation. A
   cycle-average approach is used to model the dynamics of each component
   in the combined wind turbine and storage system. Standard torque control
   is used to capture the maximum power from wind through a hydraulic pump
   attached to the turbine rotor in the nacelle. To achieve both
   accumulator pressure regulation and generator power tracking, a
   nonlinear controller is designed based on an energy based Lyapunov
   function. The nonlinear controller is then modified to distribute the
   control effort between the hydraulic and pneumatic elements based on
   their bandwidth capabilities. As a result, liquid piston air
   compressor/expander will loosely maintain the accumulator pressure
   ratio, while the down-tower hydraulic pump/motor precisely tracks the
   desired generator power. This control scheme also allows the accumulator
   to function as a damper for the storage system by absorbing power
   disturbances from the hydraulic path generated by the wind gusts. A set
   of simulation case studies demonstrate the operation of the combined
   system when the nonlinear controller is utilized and illustrates how
   this system can be used for load leveling, downsizing electrical system
   and maximizing revenues. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A mechanistic basis for the effects of crystallite size on light olefin
   selectivity in methanol-to-hydrocarbons conversion on MFI}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{321}},
Pages = {{23-31}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Light olefin selectivity in methanol-to-hydrocarbons conversion on MFI
   increases with an increase in crystallite size because intra-crystalline
   residence time of methylbenzenes increases as a consequence of increased
   transport restrictions, which enables these methylbenzenes to undergo
   multiple methylation/deallcylation reactions before exiting the crystal.
   Selectivity toward light olefins, for the reaction of dimethyl ether
   (DME) at 623 K, increased monotonically from 22\% in 2 nm-MFI (similar
   to 2 nm crystallites) to 47\% in 17 mu m-MFI (similar to 17 mu m
   crystallites) at 46-59\% net DME conversion. Transport restrictions were
   introduced externally in a conventional MFI sample (500 nm-MFI) by
   single-/multi-cycle silylation using tetraethyl orthosilicate. Light
   olefin selectivity, for the reaction of DME at 623 K and at 46-59\% net
   DME conversion, increased from 33\% in the conventional MFI sample to
   49\% in a sample that had undergone three silylation treatments.
   Adsorption uptake measurements of 2,2-dimethylbutane were used to
   estimate the ``effective{''} crystallite size of the silylated MFI
   samples. Total light olefin selectivity and ethene/(2-methyl-2-butene +
   2-methylbutane) increased monotonically with the effective crystallite
   size for all zeolite samples used in this study, irrespective of their
   provenance, thereby suggesting that the mechanistic basis for increase
   in light olefin selectivity with increasing crystallite size is the
   enhanced propagation of aromatics-based catalytic cycle. (c) 2014

Pages = {{12-17}},

Abstract = {{Late spring frosts can damage vegetative tissues and may result in
   reduced tree growth. If this damage varies among tree species, it has
   the potential to influence forest community composition. We examined
   tree responses to a late spring frost in an Ozark forest to determine
   variation among seven species that included mesic species increasing in
   the region and historically dominant xeric trees. Stem damage was
   surveyed a few weeks after a frost event and growth changes by
   determining radial growth in harvested saplings at the end of the
   growing season. Trees varied dramatically in the incidence of damage,
   ranging from less than 2\% of stem tips damaged in Acer rubrum L. and
   Cornus florida L. to greater than 85\% damaged in Quercus stellata
   Beadle and Carya glabra (Mill.) Sweet. In most species, growth relative
   to the previous year declined anywhere from 17 to 35\%. Despite a high
   incidence of stem damage, the growth of Carya glabra was unaffected by
   the frost event. These results confirm that late frost damage can
   differentially affect tree species in Ozark forests. However, the lack
   of association between damage levels and subsequent growth makes the
   magnitude of this impact difficult to assess.}},

Title = {{Precise piston trajectory control for a free piston engine}},
Journal = {{CONTROL ENGINEERING PRACTICE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{34}},
Pages = {{30-38}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{A free piston engine removes the mechanical constraint on the piston
   motion by eliminating the crankshaft. The extra degree of freedom offers
   many advantages for reducing fuel consumption and emissions.
   Nevertheless, stability and robustness of the engine operation has been
   affected in the meantime. To ensure smooth engine operation, an active
   motion controller, which utilizes robust repetitive control, was
   developed previously to regulate the piston motion of a hydraulic free
   piston engine to track pre-defined trajectories. However, the long
   piston stroke length, high operating frequency and system nonlinearity
   impose challenges to precise piston motion control. Therefore,
   feedforward controllers are investigated in this paper to complement the
   repetitive control to further improve the tracking performance. The
   first feedforward design involves the inversion of a linear plant model
   that describes the dynamics of the engine operation, and the second
   design is based on the flatness approach, which involves the inversion
   of a nonlinear model of the system. The two feedforward controllers are
   designed and implemented on the free piston engine. The experimental and
   simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control
   under various operating conditions and reference piston trajectories.

Title = {{Optimal Dispatch of Residential Photovoltaic Inverters Under Forecasting

Abstract = {{Efforts to ensure reliable operation of existing low-voltage
   distribution systems with high photovoltaic (PV) generation have focused
   on the possibility of inverters providing ancillary services such as
   active power curtailment and reactive power compensation. Major benefits
   include the possibility of averting overvoltages, which may otherwise be
   experienced when PV generation exceeds the demand. This paper deals with
   ancillary service procurement in the face of solar irradiance
   forecasting errors. In particular, assuming that forecasted PV
   irradiance can be described by a random variable with known (empirical)
   distribution, the proposed uncertainty-aware optimal inverter dispatch
   (OID) framework indicates which inverters should provide ancillary
   services with a guaranteed a priori risk level of PV generation surplus.
   To capture forecasting errors and strike a balance between risk of
   overvoltages and (re) active power reserves, the concept of conditional
   value-at-risk is advocated. Due to AC power balance equations and binary
   inverter selection variables, the formulated OID involves the solution
   of a nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear program. However, a
   computationally affordable convex relaxation is derived by leveraging
   sparsity-promoting regularization approaches and semidefinite relaxation
   techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Vector space interference alignment (IA) is known to achieve high
   degrees of freedom (DoFs) with infinite-independent channel extensions,
   but its performance is largely unknown for a finite number of possibly
   dependent channel extensions. In this paper, we consider a K-user M-t x
   M-r MIMO interference channel (IC) with an arbitrary number of channel
   extensions T and arbitrary channel diversity order L (i.e., each channel
   matrix is a generic linear combination of L fixed basis matrices). We
   study the maximum DoF achievable via vector space IA in the single beam
   case (i.e., each user sends one data stream). We prove that the total
   number of users K that can communicate interference free using linear
   transceivers is upper bounded by NL + N-2/4, where N = min\{MtT, MrT\}.
   An immediate consequence of this upper bound is that for a Single-Input
   Single-Output (SISO) IC the DoF in the single beam case is no more than
   min \{root 5/4K, L + 1/4T\}. When the channel extensions are
   independent, i.e., L achieves the maximum MrMtT, we show that this
   maximum DoF lies in {[}M-r + M-t - 1, M-r + M-t] regardless of T. Unlike
   the well-studied constant MIMO IC case, the main difficulty is how to
   deal with a hybrid system of equation (zero-forcing condition) and
   inequalities (full rank condition). Our approach combines algebraic
   tools that deal with equations with an induction analysis that
   indirectly considers the inequalities.}},

Title = {{Gradient Rotating Outer Volume Excitation (GROOVE): A Novel Method for
   Single-Shot Two-Dimensional Outer Volume Suppression}},
Journal = {{MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{73}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{139-149}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{PurposeTo introduce a new outer volume suppression (OVS) technique that
   uses a single pulse and rotating gradients to accomplish frequency-swept
   excitation. This new technique, which is called gradient rotating outer
   volume excitation (GROOVE), produces a circular or elliptical
   suppression band rather than suppressing the entire outer volume.
   MethodsTheoretical and k-space descriptions of GROOVE are provided. The
   properties of GROOVE were investigated with simulations, phantom, and
   human experiments performed using a 4T horizontal bore magnet equipped
   with a TEM coil.
   ResultsSimilar suppression performance was obtained in phantom and human
   brain using GROOVE with circular and elliptical shapes. Simulations
   indicate that GROOVE requires less SAR and time than traditional OVS
   schemes, but traditional schemes provide a sharper transition zone and
   less residual signal.
   ConclusionGROOVE represents a new way of performing OVS in which spins
   are excited temporally in space on a trajectory that can be tailored to
   fit the shape of the suppression region. In addition, GROOVE is capable
   of suppressing tailored regions of space with more flexibility and in a
   shorter period of time than conventional methods. GROOVE provides a
   fast, low SAR alternative to conventional OVS methods in some
   applications (e.g., scalp suppression). Magn Reson Med, 2014. (c) 2014

Abstract = {{Purpose. To investigate the effect of an artificial scotoma on open-loop
   disparity vergence responses (DVRs) and vergence control mechanisms, we
   examined open-loop DVRs to disparity stimuli using monocular artificial
   scotomas in normal subjects.
   Methods. Using a mirror haploscope with two computer monitors, we
   delivered disparity stimuli on a pair of random dot patterns subtending
   40 by 30 degrees at 47 cm from each eye. The scotomas were black circles
   located in the center of a random dot pattern for the left eye. Eye
   movements of both eyes were recorded with a magnetic search coil system.
   Results. We first found that the amplitudes of DVRs were gradually
   decreased and the latency of DVRs was moderately increased as the size
   of the scotomas was increased. Second, monocular responses from each eye
   were symmetrical although the stimuli to each eye were asymmetrical.
   Conclusions. The results suggest that the monocular eye movements in
   disparity vergence are controlled by a binocular central mechanism, not
   driven separately by monocular inputs in the open-loop window.}},

Title = {{Applicability of a noise-based model to estimate in-traffic exposure to
   black carbon and particle number concentrations in different cultures}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{89-98}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Several studies show that a significant portion of daily air pollution
   exposure, in particular black carbon (BC), occurs during transport. In a
   previous work, a model for the in-traffic exposure of bicyclists to BC
   was proposed based on spectral evaluation of mobile noise measurements
   and validated with BC measurements in Ghent, Belgium. In this paper,
   applicability of this model in a different cultural context with a
   totally different traffic and mobility situation is presented. In
   addition, a similar modeling approach is tested for particle number (PN)
   concentration.
   Indirectly assessing BC and PN exposure through a model based on noise
   measurements is advantageous because of the availability of very
   affordable noise monitoring devices. Our previous work showed that a
   model including specific spectral components of the noise that relate to
   engine and rolling emission and basic meteorological data, could be
   quite accurate. Moreover, including a background concentration
   adjustment improved the model considerably. To explore whether this
   model could also be used in a different context with or without tuning
   of the model parameters, a study was conducted in Bangalore, India.
   Noise measurement equipment, data storage, data processing, continent,
   country, measurement operators, vehicle fleet, driving behavior, biking
   facilities, background concentration, and meteorology are all very
   different from the first measurement campaign in Belgium. More than 24 h
   of combined in-traffic noise, BC, and PN measurements were collected. It
   was shown that the noise-based BC exposure model gives good predictions
   in Bangalore and that the same approach is also successful for PN. Cross
   validation of the model parameters was used to compare factors that
   impact exposure across study sites. A pooled model (combining the
   measurements of the two locations) results in a correlation of 0.84 when
   fitting the total trip exposure in Bangalore. Estimating particulate
   matter exposure with traffic noise measurements was thus shown to be a
   valid approach across countries and cultures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The use of irreversible electroporation (IRE) for cancer treatment has
   increased sharply over the past decade. As a non-thermal therapy, IRE
   offers several potential benefits over other focal therapies, which
   include 1) short treatment delivery time, 2) reduced collateral thermal
   injury, and 3) the ability to treat tumors adjacent to major blood
   vessels. These advantages have stimulated widespread interest in basic
   through clinical studies of IRE. For instance, many in vitro and in vivo
   studies now identify treatment planning protocols (IRE threshold, pulse
   parameters, etc.), electrode delivery (electrode design, placement,
   intraoperative imaging methods, etc.), injury evaluation (methods and
   timing), and treatment efficacy in different cancer models. Therefore,
   this study reviews the in vitro, translational, and clinical studies of
   IRE cancer therapy based on major experimental studies particularly
   within the past decade. Further, this study provides organized data and
   facts to assist further research, optimization, and clinical

Abstract = {{A filter is required to eliminate the high-frequency switching ripple

   specifications of allowable total harmonic distortion in the grid
   current and distortion in the input voltage. The MC is modeled for the
   grid frequency component in order to evaluate the design for input power
   factor and voltage drop across the filter. A damping resistance has been
   designed ensuring minimum ohmic loss. The analytical estimation of the
   ripple current and the proposed design procedure have been validated by
   simulations in MATLAB/Simulink and experiments on a laboratory

Abstract = {{Medium-chain esters such as isobutyl acetate (IBAc) and isoamyl acetate
   (IAAc) are high-volume solvents, flavors and fragrances. In this work,
   we engineered synthetic metabolic pathways in Escherichia cob for the
   total biosynthesis of IBAc and IAAc directly from glucose. Our pathways
   harnessed the power of natural amino acid biosynthesis. In particular,
   the native valine and leucine pathways in E coli were utilized to supply
   the precursors. Then alcohol acyltransferases from various organisms
   were investigated on their capability to catalyze esterification
   reactions. It was discovered that ATF1 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae was
   the best enzyme for the formation of both IBAc and IAAc in E. coli. In
   vitro biochemical characterization of ATF1 confirmed the fermentation
   results and provided rational guidance for future enzyme engineering. We
   also performed strain improvement by removing byproduct pathways (Delta
   ldh, Delta poxB, Delta pta) and increased the production of both target
   chemicals. Then the best IBAc producing strain was used for scale-up
   fermentation in a 1.3-L benchtop bioreactor. 36 g/L of IBAc was produced
   after 72 h fermentation. This work demonstrates the feasibility of total
   biosynthesis of medium-chain esters as renewable chemicals. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{As the end draws near for Moore's law, the search for low-power
   alternatives to complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)
   technology is intensifying. Among the various post-CMOS candidates,
   spintronic devices have gained special attention for their potential to
   overcome the power and performance limitations of CMOS. In particular,
   all spin logic (ASL) technology, which performs Boolean operations and
   transfers the output in the spin domain, has been proposed for enabling
   new capabilities-such as high density, low device count, and
   nonvolatility-that were previously impossible with CMOS technology. In
   this paper, first we provide an overview of the history and the current
   status of the various spintronic devices being pursued by the research
   community. Then, we describe how spin-based components are integrated
   into a computing system and the advantages that result. We use a
   hypothetical spintronic-based Intel Core i7 as a test vehicle to compare
   the system-level power requirements of ASL- and CMOS-based systems,
   taking into consideration the unique demands of spin-based
   interconnects. We conclude with a brief analysis of current limitations
   and future directions of spintronic research.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, a 3-step design and optimization method is presented for
   a bioremediation system utilizing silica gel encapsulated whole-cell
   biocatalyst. Characterization experiments were conducted to determine
   the parameters of a steady state reaction/diffusion model for
   encapsulated AtzA biocatalyst that was subsequently verified
   experimentally. Dimensionless numbers governing the reaction rate, the
   Thiele modulus (Phi) and effectiveness factor (eta), were evaluated
   based on the design parameters of the material, rho (cell loading
   density) and L-c (characteristic length). Mechanical properties of the
   gel were determined as a function of rho. Optimal values for rho and L-c
   were determined for a case study, based on biocatalytic performance,
   mechanical properties and cost. It was found that free biocatalyst
   reaction kinetics are first order with K-free = 7.38 x 10(-2) s(-1)/(g
   cells/mL) and diffusivity of atrazine in the gel increases with rho,
   from 3.51 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s up to 6.93 x 10(-4) mm(2)/s. Modeling results
   showed that similar to 20\% of activity was lost during encapsulation.
   Diffusion limitations became significant (Phi > 1) when L-c exceeded
   0.1-0.3 mm. The optimal catalyst radius and cell loading density were
   determined to be L-c = 0.2 mm and rho = 0.11 g cells/mL gel, for an
   atrazine bioremediation setup with a desired effluent <3 ppb. (C) 2014

Title = {{Computationally efficient design of optimal strategies for controllable

Journal = {{STRUCTURAL CONTROL \& HEALTH MONITORING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{1-18}},

Abstract = {{The development of control strategies for controllable passive dampers
   semiactive' damping devices is complicated by the nonlinear and
   dissipative nature of the devices and the nonlinear nature of the
   closed-loop system with any form of parametric feedback control. Control
   design for nonlinear systems is often achieved by designing a control
   for a linearized model since strategies for linear systems are
   straightforward. One such approach is clipped-optimal control in which
   the desired damper forces are determined from an optimal controller
   (e.g., linear quadratic regulator, linear quadratic Gaussian, H-2 and
   H), which is designed assuming that the damping devices are fully linear
   actuators that can exert any forces (dissipative or nondissipative), and
   a secondary bang-bang controller commands the controllable damper to
   exert forces as close as possible to the desired forces. However,
   designs using any linearized model generally result in suboptimal (and
   sometimes very poor) performance because the linear actuator assumption
   differs from the actual implementation with a dissipative damping
   device. Thus, one must generally resort to a large-scale parameter study
   in which the nonlinear system is simulated many times to determine
   control strategies that are actually optimal for the nonlinear
   controlled closed-loop system. This paper demonstrates how an approach
   developed by the authors, which can reduce the model of a system with
   local modifications to a lower order set of Volterra integral equations
   in the modification forces, can significantly decrease the computational
   burden of a complex control design study for controllable dampers. The
   approach is first adapted to use a state feedback control with a
   bang-bang on-off secondary controller. Then, the structural and damping
   device models are detailed. The optimal semiactive control design is
   demonstrated via both a parameter study and an optimization algorithm.
   Numerical examples demonstrate that the approach is effective and,
   compared with a conventional simulation approach, can reduce computation
   time by two orders of magnitude. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{We show that the most classical Kirchhoff-Love theory of thin plates is
   compatible with the occurrence of a specific singular shear-force state
   in the interior of the body. It is well-known from Kirchhoff that, on
   the edge boundary of the plate, the specific shear-forces and the
   curve-gradient of the specific twisting-moments, measured per unit
   length, are statically inter-related. We observe and prove that a
   similar static equivalence holds for the edge boundary of any sub-body,
   and this allows many interpretations of the contact interactions that
   may take place between the parts of the plate. In particular, a specific
   shear-force acting on a smooth part of the edge boundary of a sub-body
   may depend upon its curvature, tending to a concentrated force at a
   sharp corner. The possibility of developing concentrated contact
   interactions is a general characteristic of non-simple continua, of
   which the theory of thin plates is but one representative example.}},

Abstract = {{DNA nanotubes were created using molecular self-assembly of
   single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)-amphiphiles composed of a hydrophobic
   dialkyl tail and polycarbon spacer and a hydrophilic ssDNA headgroup.
   The nanotube structures were formed by bilayers of amphiphiles, with the
   hydrophobic components forming an inner layer that was shielded from the
   aqueous solvent by an outer layer of ssDNA. The nanotubes appeared to
   form via an assembly process that included transitions from twisted
   nanotapes to helical nanotapes to nanotubes. Amphiphiles that contained
   different ssDNA headgroups were created to explore the effect of the
   length and secondary structure of the ssDNA headgroup on the
   self-assembly behavior of the amphiphiles in the presence and absence of
   the polycarbon spacer. It was found that nanotubes could be formed using
   a variety of headgroup lengths and sequences. The ability to create
   nanotubes via ssDNA-amphiphile self-assembly offers an alternative to
   the other purely DNA-based approaches like DNA origami and DNA tile
   assembly for constructing these structures and may be useful for
   applications in drug delivery, biosensing, and electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware implementations of artificial neural networks typically require
   significant amounts of hardware resources. This paper proposes a novel
   radial basis function artificial neural network using stochastic
   computing elements, which greatly reduces the required hardware. The
   Gaussian function used for the radial basis function is implemented with
   a two-dimensional finite state machine. The norm between the input data
   and the center point is optimized using simple logic gates. Results from
   two pattern recognition case studies, the standard Iris flower and the
   MICR font benchmarks, show that the difference of the average mean
   squared error between the proposed stochastic network and the
   corresponding traditional deterministic network is only 1.3\% when the
   stochastic stream length is 10kbits. The accuracy of the recognition
   rate varies depending on the stream length, which gives the designer
   tremendous flexibility to tradeoff speed, power, and accuracy. From the
   FPGA implementation results, the hardware resource requirement of the
   proposed stochastic hidden neuron is only a few percent of the hardware
   requirement of the corresponding deterministic hidden neuron. The
   proposed stochastic network can be expanded to larger scale networks for
   complex tasks with simple hardware architectures.}},

Abstract = {{It has been recognized recently that semidefinite optimization problems
   (SDP) can be cast into second order cone programs (SOCP) by replacing
   the positive definiteness constraints with stronger, scaled diagonal
   dominance (SDD) conditions. Since the scalability of SOCP solvers is
   much better than that of the SDPs, the new formulation allows solving
   large dimensional problems more efficiently. However, scaled diagonal
   dominant matrices form only a subset of the positive definite matrices.
   Hence, the new problem formulation results in more conservative
   solutions. This paper analyses the efficiency and conservativeness of
   the SDD formulation on two particular problems: the stability analysis
   and induced L-2 gain computation for linear parameter-varying systems.
   In the paper some important features of the SDD formulation are revealed
   and numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{There is a growing demand for low-noise and lowpower wireless
   neurosensors for emerging clinical indications such as epilepsy, where
   long-term, neurological health must be monitored to detect seizures. In
   this paper, we present an integrated recorder chip that is part of a
   wireless system to record and process sub-scalp electroencephalography
   (EEG) data for seizure detection and treatment. The recorder is designed
   based on a novel frequency-shaping architecture that offers competitive
   circuit specifications on power, noise, precision, and chronic
   stability. The design is fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process. When
   measured at a 2.5kHz clock and 1.0V supply, the recorder can be switched
   between two bandwidths, where the lower bandwidth (50Hz) is for
   recording regular EEG data and the higher bandwidth (500Hz) is for
   recording high frequency oscillations {[}1]. The recorder is designed
   with a wide data dynamic range in order to avoid saturation from 50mV
   ambulatory motion artifacts when the gain of the active filter is set to
   2V/V. The total power consumption is under 2.5 mu W/ch and the
   input-referred noise is 0.8 mu V from 150Hz and 1.4 mu V from 1-500Hz. A
   proof-of-concept prototype has been also developed to demonstrate that
   the recorder is insensitive to ambient interferences and movement
   artifacts in experiments.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present recent results on coupling geographic,
   infrastructure, and building models to multi-resolution numerical
   simulations. In order to achieve this, a parallel data access framework
   with interfaces to all parts of the simulation pipeline such as
   pre-processing, numerical simulation, and post-processing has been
   developed. The applicability of the approach presented in this work is
   shown by simulating urban flooding including surface flow of a city, the
   pipe network interaction, and its consequences to individual buildings.
   While the real life city model including the drainage system has been
   provided by the authorities of the city of Munich and comprises an area
   of about 2 by 2 km with detailed topography and a complete set of
   approximately 3,000 buildings modelled on LOD 1 of CityGML, IFC-models
   are the initial starting points for generating octrees on the level of
   individual buildings. In order to investigate the effects of the
   drainage system collapsing due to a heavy rain scenario, a fully
   three-dimensional parallel free surface flow simulation is incorporated
   with the interaction of the one-dimensional pipe-network flow. The whole
   simulation is performed on three levels of resolution, each of which is
   discretised by a fast voxelisation algorithm to generate a computational
   grid for the CFD simulation.}},

Abstract = {{Isobutyrate is an important platform chemical with various industrial
   applications. Previously, a synthetic metabolic pathway was constructed
   in E. coli to produce isobutyrate from glucose. However, isobutanol was
   found to be a major byproduct. Herein, gene knockouts and enzyme
   overexpressions were performed to optimize further the engineered E.
   coli strain. Besides yqhD, the knockouts of three genes eutG, yiaY and
   ygjB increased isobutyrate production in shake flasks. Furthermore, the
   introduction of an additional padA on a medium copy number plasmid under
   the constitutive promoter significantly reduced isobutanol formation.
   The IBA15-2C strain (BW25113, Delta yqhD, Delta ygjB; carrying two
   copies of padA) produced 39.2\% more isobutyrate (0.39 g/glucose yield,
   80\% of the theoretical maximum yield) than IBA1-1C strain (BW25113,
   Delta yqhD; carrying one copy of padA). A scale-up process was also
   investigated for IBA15-2C strain to optimize the conditions for the
   production of isobutyrate in the fermentor. With Ca(OH)(2) as the base
   for pH control and 10\% dissolved oxygen level, IBA15-2C strain produced
   90 g/L isobutyrate after 144 h. This study has engineered E. coli to
   achieve biosynthesis of a nonnative compound with the highest titer and
   opened up the possibility of the industrial production of isobutyrate.}},

Abstract = {{The immune system generates antibodies and antigen-specific T-cells as
   basic elements of the immune networks that differentiate self from
   non-self in a finely tuned manner. The antigen-specific nature of immune
   responses ensures that normal immune activation contains non-self when
   tolerating self. Here we review the B-1 subset of lymphocytes which
   produce self-reactive antibodies. By analyzing the IgM class of natural
   antibodies that recognize antigens from the nervous system, we emphasize
   that natural antibodies are biomarkers of how the immune system monitors
   the host. The immune response activated against self can be detrimental
   when triggered in an autoimmune genetic background. In contrast, tuning
   immune activity with natural antibodies is a potential therapeutic
   strategy.}},

Abstract = {{A method of identifying solenoid valve transition events by analyzing

   experience lags and transition times which are non-trivial in the

   the timing of valve transition events with less than 7\% error when
   compared to measuring the position of the valve spool with a laser

   the current through the solenoid coil and requires no modification to
   the valve or valve housing to achieve these results.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLUID POWER}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{149-161}},
Abstract = {{The hydraulic flywheel accumulator is a novel energy storage device that
   has the potential to overcome major drawbacks of conventional energy
   storage methods for mobile hydraulic systems. By employing a rotating
   pressure vessel, the hydraulic flywheel accumulator stores energy in
   both the hydro-pneumatic domain and the rotating kinetic domain. This
   allows for energy storage densities many times higher than conventional
   hydraulic accumulators and adds a degree of freedom that decouples state
   of charge from the hydraulic system pressure. This paper summarizes
   various mechanical stress and energy models developed to describe the
   behavior of the hydraulic flywheel accumulator. The models are used in
   an example design optimization to illustrate the utility of the
   hydraulic flywheel accumulator. The resulting design solution delivers
   an energy storage density at least six times greater than traditional
   composite hydraulic accumulators while exhibiting efficiencies above
   75\%.}},

Title = {{Range search on tuples of points}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF DISCRETE ALGORITHMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},
Pages = {{1-12}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Range search is a fundamental query-retrieval problem, where the goal is
   to preprocess a given set of points so that the points lying inside a
   query object (e.g., a rectangle, or a ball, or a halfspace) can be
   reported efficiently. This paper considers a new version of the range
   search problem: Several disjoint sets of points are given along with an
   ordering of the sets. The goal is to preprocess the sets so that for any
   query point q and a distance delta, all the ordered sequences (i.e.,
   tuples) of points can be reported (one per set and consistent with the
   given ordering of the sets) such that, for each tuple, the total
   distance traveled starting from q and visiting the points of the tuple
   in the specified order is no more than d. The problem has applications
   in trip planning, where the objective is to visit venues of multiple
   types starting from a given location such that the total distance
   traveled satisfies a distance constraint. Efficient solutions are given
   for the fixed distance and variable distance versions of this problem,
   where delta is known beforehand or is specified as part of the query,
   respectively. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Measurement of Interobserver Disagreement: Correction of Cohen's Kappa
   for Negative Values}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PROBABILITY AND STATISTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{As measures of interobserver agreement for both nominal and ordinal
   categories, Cohen's kappa coefficients appear to be the most widely used
   with simple and meaningful interpretations. However, for negative
   coefficient values when (the probability of) observed disagreement
   exceeds chance-expected disagreement, no fixed lower bounds exist for
   the kappa coefficients and their interpretations are no longer
   meaningful and may be entirely misleading. In this paper, alternative
   measures of disagreement (or negative agreement) are proposed as simple
   corrections or modifications of Cohen's kappa coefficients. The new
   coefficients have a fixed lower bound of -1 that can be attained
   irrespective of the marginal distributions. A coefficient is formulated
   for the case when the classification categories are nominal and a
   weighted coefficient is proposed for ordinal categories. Besides
   coefficients for the overall disagreement across categories,
   disagreement coefficients for individual categories are presented.
   Statistical inference procedures are developed and numerical examples
   are provided.}},

Journal = {{MOLECULAR THERAPY-METHODS \& CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Abstract = {{Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a fatal disease of striated muscle
   deterioration. A unique therapeutic approach for DMD is the use of
   synthetic membrane stabilizers to protect the fragile dystrophic
   sarcolemma against contraction-induced mechanical stress. Block
   copolymer-based membrane stabilizer poloxamer 188 (P188) has been shown
   to protect the dystrophic myocardium. In comparison, the ability of
   synthetic membrane stabilizers to protect fragile DMD skeletal muscles
   has been less clear. Because cardiac and skeletal muscles have distinct
   structural and functional features, including differences in the
   mechanism of activation, variance in sarcolemma phospholipid
   composition, and differences in the magnitude and types of forces
   generated, we speculated that optimized membrane stabilization could be
   inherently different. Our objective here is to use principles of
   pharmacodynamics to evaluate membrane stabilization therapy for DMD
   skeletal muscles. Results show a dramatic differential effect of
   membrane stabilization by optimization of pharmacodynamic-guided route
   of poloxamer delivery. Data show that subcutaneous P188 delivery, but
   not intravascular or intraperitoneal routes, conferred significant
   protection to dystrophic limb skeletal muscles undergoing mechanical
   stress in vivo. In addition, structure-function examination of synthetic
   membrane stabilizers further underscores the importance of copolymer
   composition, molecular weight, and dosage in optimization of poloxamer
   pharmacodynamics in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{How much water can swales infiltrate? How can we accurately measure
   infiltration? From our study we have found that in swales and other
   stormwater BMPs, sufficient measurements of infiltration parameters must
   be made to compensate for the large spatial variation in infiltration
   rates. The infiltration measurement involves estimating saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) of the soil and soil suction.
   Individually measured (K-sat) values can vary by a factor of 100,
   indicating that large uncertainty can exist with the use of only one
   measurement. From our study we found that 20 measurements at each swale
   can reduce the uncertainty of K t around the geometric mean to a factor
   of between 2 and 4. By using these infiltration measurements one can
   estimate the amount of infiltration loss of a swale for a given design
   storm. A computational model has been developed to estimate the
   infiltration of roadway stormwater runoff into the swales for given
   rainfall intensities. This model is based on the Green-Ampt assumptions
   and takes into consideration the antecedent moisture condition of the
   soil, saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil suction the soil, and
   the geometry of the channel Using this model the volume reduction of a
   typical swale for six different types of soil and both wet and dry
   condition is calculated for two design storms. It was found that swales
   can infiltrate 22 to 100\% of stormwater runoff volume depending on the
   soil type (clay to sand).}},

Abstract = {{An important breakthrough in the field of genome engineering was the
   discovery of the modular Transcription A ctivator-Like Effector (TALE)
   DNA binding domain and the development of TALE nucleases (TALENs).
   TALENs enable researchers to make DNA double-strand breaks in target
   loci to create gene knockouts or introduce specific DNA sequence
   modifications. Precise genome engineering is increasingly being used to
   study gene function, develop disease models or create new traits in crop
   species. Underlying the boom in genome engineering is the striking
   simplicity and low cost of engineering new specificities of TALENs and
   other sequence-specific nucleases. In this chapter, we describe a rapid,
   inexpensive, and user-friendly protocol for custom TALEN construction
   based on one of the most popular TALEN assembly platforms, the Golden
   Gate cloning method. Using this protocol, ready-to-use TALENs with
   specificity for targets 13-32 bp long are constructed within 5 days.}},

Abstract = {{Embryonic tissue mechanics play an important role in regulating
   morphogenesis during organ formation, both in a bottom-up sense, where
   changes in gene expression drive mechanical shape changes, and in a
   top-down sense, where perturbations in tissue mechanics feed back to
   drive changes in gene expression. In growing tissues that can generate
   internal forces and have complex geometries, like those in the embryo,
   it can often be difficult to empirically determine the mechanical state
   of the tissue, let alone the relationships between gene expression and
   mechanical behavior. Mathematical models can be used to fill this gap.
   Here, we discuss elasticity-based models for growing tissues with a
   specific focus on targeted growth in embryonic tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Commonly considered strategies for reducing the environmental impact of
   light-duty transportation include using alternative fuels and improving
   vehicle fuel economy. We evaluate the air quality-elated human health
   impacts of 10 such options, including the use of liquid biofuels,
   diesel, and compressed natural gas (CNG) in internal combustion engines;
   the use of electricity from a range of conventional and renewable
   sources to power electric vehicles (EVs); and the use of hybrid EV
   technology. Our approach combines spatially, temporally, and chemically
   detailed life cycle emission inventories; comprehensive, fine-scale
   state-of-the-science chemical transport modeling; and exposure,
   concentration-response, and economic health impact modeling for ozone
   (O-3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). We find that powering
   vehicles with corn ethanol or with coal-based or ``grid average{''}
   electricity increases monetized environmental health impacts by 80\% or
   more relative to using conventional gasoline. Conversely, EVs powered by
   low-emitting electricity from natural gas, wind, water, or solar power
   reduce environmental health impacts by 50\% or more. Consideration of
   potential climate change impacts alongside the human health outcomes
   described here further reinforces the environmental preferability of EVs
   powered by low-emitting electricity relative to gasoline vehicles.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of UV light and air exposure on the photoluminescent
   properties of nonthermal plasma-synthesized silicon nanocrystals (Si
   NCs) were investigated. Si NCs with high-efficiency photoluminescence
   (PL) have been achieved via a post-synthesis hydrosilylation process.
   Photobleaching is observed within the first few hours of ultra-violet
   (UV) irradiation. Equilibrium is reached after similar to 4 h of UV
   exposure wherein the Si NCs are able to retain 52\% of the initially
   measured PL quantum yield (PLQY). UV-treated Si NCs showed recovery of
   PL with time. Gas-phase passivation of Si NCs by hydrogen afterglow
   injection improves PLQY and PL stability against UV and air exposure.
   Additionally, phosphorous doping can also improve UV stability of
   photoluminescent Si NCs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   for rhythmic hormone delivery}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{196}},
Pages = {{261-271}},
Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Numerous hormones are known to be endogenously secreted in a pulsatile
   manner. In particular, gonadotropin replacing hormone (GnRH) is released
   in rhythmic pulses, and disruption of this rhythm is associated with
   pathologies of reproduction and sexual development. In an effort to
   develop an implantable, rhythmic delivery system, a scheme has been
   demonstrated involving a negative feedback instability between a
   pH-sensitive membrane and enzymes that convert endogenous glucose to
   hydrogen ion. A bench prototype system based on this scheme was
   previously shown to produce near rhythmic oscillations in internal pH
   and in GnRH delivery over a period of one week. In the present work, a
   systematic study of conditions permitting such oscillations is
   presented, along with a study of factors causing period of oscillations
   to increase with time and ultimately cease. Membrane composition,
   glucose concentration, and surface area of marble (CaCO3), which is
   incorporated as a reactant, were found to affect the capacity of the
   system to oscillate, and the pH range over which oscillations occur.
   Accumulation of gluconate(-) and Ca2+ in the system over time correlated
   with lengthening of oscillation period, and possibly with cessation of
   oscillations. Enzyme degradation may also be a factor. These studies
   provide the groundwork for future improvements in device design. (C)

Abstract = {{Microtopography has been observed to lead to altered attachment behavior
   for marine fouling organisms; however, quantification of this phenomenon
   is lacking in the scientific literature. Here, we present quantitative
   measurement of the disruption of normal attachment behavior of the
   fouling algae Ulva linza by antifouling microtopographies. The
   distribution of the diatom Navicula incerta was shown to be unaffected
   by the presence of topography. The radial distribution function was
   calculated for both individual zoospores and cells as well as aggregates
   of zoospores from attachment data for a variety topographic
   configurations and at a number of different attachment densities.
   Additionally, the screening distance and maximum values were mapped
   according to the location of zoospore aggregates within a single unit
   cell. We found that engineered topographies decreased the distance
   between spore aggregates compared to that for a smooth control surface;
   however, the distributions for individual spores were unchanged. We also
   found that the local attachment site geometry affected the screening
   distance for aggregates of zoospores, with certain geometries decreasing
   screening distance and others having no measurable effect. The
   distribution mapping techniques developed and explored in this article
   have yielded important insight into the design parameters for
   antifouling microtopographies that can be implemented in the next
   generation of antifouling surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the topic of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) is
   discussed and a program in which it is being applied to a wind turbine
   system for leveling power supplied to the grid is described. Noted is
   the importance of heat transfer in the design of the compressor and its
   effect on performance. Presented is a design for minimizing the
   temperature rise in the compressor during compression. The design
   requires modeling regenerative heat transfer from the compressed air to
   solid material inserted in the compression space. Modeling requires
   characterizing pressure drop through the porous insert, interfacial heat
   transfer between solid and fluid in the matrix, and thermal dispersion
   within the porous regions. Computation and experimentation are applied
   for developing correlations for such terms. Two types of porous media
   are applied: interrupted plates and open-cell metal foams. Cases with
   foam inserts are computed and the results are discussed. Discovered in
   the results are some complex secondary flow features in spaces above the
   porous inserts. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   was realized. Such unique ``all-in-one{''} feature enabled the prepared
   hollow nanofiber membrane-based test strips to be applied either as
   colorimetric sensors in solution or as an optical biosensor operated in
   the ``dip-and-read{''} mode. When used as a colorimetric biosensor in
   solution, the test strip with o-dianisidine as chromogenic agent shows
   an excellent linear response range between 0.01 mM to 20 mM and a high
   apparent lumped activity recovery of 62.1\% as compared to the reaction
   rate of the free bi-enzyme system. While the activity recovery of the
   test strip with ABTS as chromogenic agent is only 18.0\%, and the test
   strip is found to be unstable due to spontaneous-oxidation of the ABTS.
   The o-dianisidine test strip was also applied as an optical biosensor,
   visible rufous color was quickly developed on the surface of the
   membrane upon dropping 10 mu L of glucose sample, and an excellent
   correlation between differential diffusive reflectance of the test strip
   at 440 nm and glucose concentration was obtained in the range of 0.5-50
   mM. The test strips also exhibited excellent long-term storage stability
   with a half-life at 25 degrees C as long as four months.}},

Abstract = {{Synthesis of atomically thin MoS2 layers and its derivatives with
   large-area uniformity is an essential step to exploit the advanced
   properties of MoS2 for their possible applications in electronic and
   optoelectronic devices. In this work, a facile method is reported for
   the continuous synthesis of atomically thin MoS2 layers at wafer scale
   through thermolysis of a spin coated-ammonium tetrathiomolybdate film.
   The thickness and surface morphology of the sheets are characterized by
   atomic force microscopy. The optical properties are studied by
   UV-Visible absorption, Raman and photoluminescence spectroscopies. The
   compositional analysis of the layers is done by X-ray photoemission
   spectroscopy. The atomic structure and morphology of the grains in the
   polycrystalline MoS2 atomic layers are examined by high-angle annular
   dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy. The electron
   mobilities of the sheets are evaluated using back-gate field-effect
   transistor configuration. The results indicate that this facile method
   is a promising approach to synthesize MoS2 thin films at the wafer scale
   and can also be applied to synthesis of WS2 and hybrid MoS2-WS2 thin
   layers.}},

Abstract = {{Frank-Kasper phases are tetrahedrally packed structures occurring in
   numerous materials, from elements to intermetallics to self-assembled
   soft materials. They exhibit complex manifolds of Wigner-Seitz cells
   with many-faceted polyhedra, forming an important bridge between the
   simple close-packed periodic and quasiperiodic crystals. The recent
   discovery of the Frank-Kasper s-phase in diblock and tetrablock polymers
   stimulated the experiments reported here on a poly(isoprene-b-lactide)
   diblock copolymer melt. Analysis of small-angle X-ray scattering and
   mechanical spectroscopy exposes an undiscovered competition between the
   tendency to form self-assembled particles with spherical symmetry, and
   the necessity to fill space at uniform density within the framework
   imposed by the lattice. We thus deduce surprising analogies between the
   symmetry breaking at the body-centered cubic phase to sigma-phase
   transition in diblock copolymers, mediated by exchange of mass, and the
   symmetry breaking in certain metals and alloys (such as the elements Mn
   and U), mediated by exchange of charge. Similar connections are made
   between the role of sphericity in real space for polymer systems, and
   the role of sphericity in reciprocal space for metallic systems such as
   intermetallic compounds and alloys. These findings establish new links
   between disparate materials classes, provide opportunities to improve
   the understanding of complex crystallization by building on synergies
   between hard and soft matter, and, perhaps most significantly, challenge
   the view that the symmetry breaking required to form reduced symmetry
   structures (possibly even quasiperiodic crystals) requires particles
   with multiple predetermined shapes and/or sizes.}},

Abstract = {{Electrical Properties Tomography (EPT) technique utilizes measurable
   radio frequency (RF) coil induced magnetic fields (B1 fields) in a
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) system to quantitatively reconstruct
   the local electrical properties (EP) of biological tissues. Information
   derived from the same data set, e. g., complex numbers of B1
   distribution towards electric field calculation, can be used to
   estimate, on a subject-specific basis, local Specific Absorption Rate
   (SAR). SAR plays a significant role in RF pulse design for high-field
   MRI applications, where maximum local tissue heating remains one of the
   most constraining limits. The purpose of the present work is to
   investigate the feasibility of such B1-based local SAR estimation,
   expanding on previously proposed EPT approaches. To this end, B1
   calibration was obtained in a gelatin phantom at 7 T with a
   multi-channel transmit coil, under a particular multi-channel B1-shim
   setting (B1-shim I). Using this unique set of B1 calibration, local SAR
   distribution was subsequently predicted for B1-shim I, as well as for
   another B1-shim setting (B1-shim II), considering a specific set of
   parameter for a heating MRI protocol consisting of RF pulses plaid at
   1\% duty cycle. Local SAR results, which could not be directly measured
   with MRI, were subsequently converted into temperature change which in
   turn were validated against temperature changes measured by MRI
   Thermometry based on the proton chemical shift. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Channel state feedback is a serious burden that limits deployment of
   transmit beamforming systems with many antennas in frequency-division
   duplex (FDD) mode. Transmit beamforming with limited feedback systems
   estimate the channel at the receiver and send quantized channel state or
   beamformer information to the transmitter. A different approach that
   exploits the spatio-temporal correlation of the channel is proposed
   here. The transmitter periodically sends a beamformed pilot signal in
   the downlink, while the receiver quantizes the corresponding received
   signal and feeds back the bits to the transmitter. Assuming an
   autoregressive (AR) channel model, Kalman filtering (KF) based on the
   sign of innovations (SOI) is proposed for channel tracking, and
   closed-form expressions for the channel estimation mean-squared error
   (MSE) are derived under certain conditions. For more general channel
   models, a novel tracking approach is proposed that exploits the
   quantization bits in a maximum a posteriori (MAP) formulation.
   Simulations show that close to optimum performance can be attained with
   only 2 bits per channel dwell time block, even for systems with many
   transmit antennas. This clears a hurdle for transmit beamforming with
   many antennas in FDD mode-which was almost impossible with the prior
   state-of-art.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity-achieving polar codes have gained significant attention in
   recent years. In general, polar codes can be decoded by either
   successive cancellation (SC) or the belief propagation (BP) algorithm.
   However, unlike SC decoders, performance optimizations for BP decoders
   have not been fully explored yet. In this paper, we explore novel early
   stopping criteria for polar BP decoding to significantly reduce energy
   dissipation and decoding latency. First, we propose two detection-type
   novel early stopping criteria for detecting valid outputs. For polar
   (1024, 512) codes, these two stopping criteria can reduce the number of
   iterations by up to 42.5\% at 3.5 dB. Then, we propose a novel channel
   condition estimation approach, which can help select different stopping
   criteria in different SNR regions. Furthermore, the hardware
   architectures of polar BP decoders with the proposed stopping criteria
   are presented and developed. Synthesis results show that with the use of
   the proposed stopping criteria, the energy dissipation, and average
   latency of polar (1024, 512) BP decoder can be reduced by 10\% similar
   to 30\% with 2\% similar to 5\% hardware overhead, and average
   throughput can be increased by 20\% similar to 55\%.}},

Title = {{Monolithic and modular termination analyses for higher-order attribute

Abstract = {{In this paper we describe a sound, but not complete, analysis to prove
   the termination of higher-order attribute grammar evaluation caused by
   the creation of an unbounded number of (finite) trees as local
   tree-valued attributes, which are then themselves decorated with
   attributes. The analysis extracts a set of term-rewriting rules from the
   grammar that model creation of new syntax trees during the evaluation of
   higher-order attributes. If this term rewriting system terminates, then
   only a finite number of trees will be created during attribute grammar
   evaluation. The analysis places an ordering on nonterminals to handle
   the cases in which higher-order inherited attributes are used to ensure
   that a finite number of trees are created using such attributes. When
   paired with the traditional completeness and circularity analyses for
   attribute grammars and the assumption that each attribute equation
   defines a terminating computation, this analysis can be used to show
   that attribute grammar evaluation will terminate normally. This analysis
   can be applied to a wide range of common attribute grammar idioms and
   has been used to show that evaluation of our specification of Java 1.4
   terminates. We also describe a modular version of the analysis that is
   performed on independently developed language extension grammars and the
   host language being extended. If the extensions individually pass the
   modular analysis then their composition is also guaranteed to terminate.

Title = {{Spatiotemporal chemotactic model for ant foraging}},
Journal = {{MODERN PHYSICS LETTERS B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{30}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a generic theoretical chemotactic model that
   accounts for certain emergent behaviors observed in ant foraging. The
   model does not have many of the constraints and limitations of existing
   models for ants colony dynamics and takes into account the distinctly
   different behaviors exhibited in nature by ant foragers in search of
   food and food ferrying ants. Numerical simulations based on the model
   show trail formation in foraging ant colonies to be an emergent
   phenomenon and, in particular, replicate behavior observed in
   experiments involving the species P. megacephala. The results have
   broader implications for the study of randomness in chemotactic models.
   Potential applications include the developments of novel algorithms for
   stochastic search in engineered complex systems such as robotic swarms.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Abstract = {{We report the observation of the Hall effect at hole densities up to 6 x
   10(13) cm(-2) (0.3 holes/molecule) on the surface of electrolyte-gated
   rubrene crystals. The perplexing peak in the conductance as a function
   of gate voltage is confirmed to result from a maximum in mobility, which
   reaches 4 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at 2.5 x 10(13) cm(-2). Measurements to liquid
   helium temperatures reveal that this peak is markedly asymmetric, with
   bandlike and hopping-type transport occurring on the low density side,
   while unconventional, likely electrostatic-disorder-affected transport
   dominates the high density side. Most significantly, near the mobility
   peak the temperature coefficient of the resistance remains positive to
   as low as 120 K, the low temperature resistance becomes weakly
   temperature dependent, and the conductance reaches within a factor of 2
   of e(2)/h, revealing conduction unprecedentedly close to a
   two-dimensional metallic state.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the addition of graphene on the glass transition
   temperature (T-g) of polymers was investigated, first with poly(methyl
   methacrylate) and then with an extensive literature review. Isotactic
   (i-PMMA) and atactic PMMA (a-PMMA) were blended with pristine graphene
   (PG) and thermally reduced graphene (TRG). A Tg increase was found for
   a-PMMA nanocomposites made via in situ polymerization with TRG but not
   when a-PMMA was solvent blended with TRG. However, a Tg increase was
   found for TRG solvent blended into i-PMMA and a smaller increase for PG
   with i-PMMA. Nearly all the increase occurred at the lowest loading,
   0.25 wt \%, with little change at increased graphene concentration. Tg
   increases due to interfacial interactions between matrix polymers and
   fillers. Physical blending such as solvent processes cannot provide
   enough interaction at the interfaces, whereas chemical blending
   processes such as in situ polymerization can yield strong covalent
   bonds. However, i-PMMA molecules can align on graphene sheets at the
   interface, creating more interaction between i-PMMA and graphene than
   a-PMMA. Also, the T-g of i-PMMA is 60 degrees C lower than a-PMMA,
   meaning that hydrogen bonds are stronger at the lower temperature. The
   Tg increase of TRG/i-PMMA is higher than that of PG/i-PMMA due to more
   oxygen functionalities on TRG than on PG to act as interfacial
   interaction sites. A broad literature survey agrees with our PMMA
   results. We found no changes in T-g for graphene/polymer nanocomposites
   synthesized via physical blending processes such as solvent or melt
   blending, except for blending with strongly polar polymers. In contrast,
   chemical blending processes such as in situ polymerization or chemically
   modified fillers yielded significant T-g increases in graphene/polymer
   nanocomposites.}},

Pages = {{8446-8458}},

Abstract = {{Using pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) simulations of a discrete
   wormlike chain model, we provide compelling evidence in support of
   Odijks prediction of two distinct Odijk regimes for a long wormlike
   chain confined in a nanochannel. In both cases, the chain of persistence
   length l(p) is renormalized into a series of deflection segments of
   characteristic length D(2/3)l(p)(1/3), where D is the channel size. In
   the first (classic) Odijk regime, these deflection segments are linearly
   ordered. In the second Odijk regime, thin, long wormlike chains can
   backfold at a length scale quantified by the global persistence length.
   We have measured this quantity by simulations and modified Odijks global
   persistence length theory to account for thermal fluctuations. The
   global persistence length, which is defined to be independent of the
   effect of excluded volume, provides the requisite closure to Odijks
   scaling theory for the second regime and thus allows us to resolve much
   of the confusion surrounding the so-called transition regime for DNA
   confined in a nanochannel. We show that Odijks theory for the backfolded
   regime correctly describes both the average chain extension and the
   variance about this extension for wormlike chains in channel sizes
   between the classic Odijk regime and the de Gennes blob regimes, with
   our data spanning several decades in terms of Odijks scaling parameter
   xi. Although the backfolded Odijk regime occupies a very narrow range of
   D/l(p), it is indeed a regime when viewed in terms of ? and grows in
   size with increasing monomer anisotropy.}},

Abstract = {{Undecenoic acid functionalized thermo/pH responsive microgels,
   poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-undecenoic acid) {[}poly(VCL-co-UA)], were
   synthesized by precipitation emulsion copolymerization. The microgels
   exhibit reversible thermo/pH responsive phase transition behavior, which
   can be tuned by varying the monomer feed ratio. The lower critical
   solution temperatures (LCSTs) of the materials are close to body
   temperature. As a result, when temperatures rise above ca. 37 degrees C,
   a rapid thermal gelation process occurs, accompanied by a phase
   transition, resulting in expulsion of encapsulated compound. In vitro
   experiment evaluated its applicability as a drug carrier for controlled
   release of an anticancer agent (doxorubicin) and showed that the drug
   encapsulation efficiency (EE), releasing rate, and kinetics are
   dependent on the temperature and pH value as expected. Minimal
   cytotoxicity of the microgels was observed by a cytotoxicity assay using
   3T3 fibroblast cells. Our finding suggests that the poly(VCL-co-UA)
   based microgels may be considered a promising candidate for temperature
   or pH-controlled delivery of anticancer drugs. (C) 2014 Wiley

   insulin growth factor (IGF)-encapsulated microspheres. hiPSC-derived
   cardiomyocytes integrated into host myocardium and generated organized
   sarcomeric structures, and endothelial and smooth muscle cells
   contributed to host vasculature. Trilineage cell transplantation
   significantly improved left ventricular function, myocardial metabolism,
   and arteriole density, while reducing infarct size, ventricular wall
   stress, and apoptosis without inducing ventricular arrhythmias. These
   findings in a large animal MI model highlight the potential of utilizing

Abstract = {{We use objective boundary conditions and self-consistent charge
   density-functional-based tight-binding to simulate at the atomistic
   scale the formation of helices in narrow graphene nanoribbons with
   armchair edges terminated with fluorine and hydrogen. We interpret the
   microscopic data using an inextensible, unshearable elastic rod model,
   which considers both bending and torsional strains. When fitted to the
   atomistic data, the simple rod model uses closed-form solutions for a
   cubic equation to predict the strain energy and morphology at a given
   twist angle and the crossover point between pure torsion and a helix.
   Our modeling and simulation bring key insights into the origin of the
   helical graphene morphologies stored inside of carbon nanotubes. They
   can be useful for designing chiral nanoribbons with tailored properties.}},

Title = {{Complex host genetics influence the microbiome in inflammatory bowel
   disease}},
Journal = {{GENOME MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human genetics and host-associated microbial communities
   have been associated independently with a wide range of chronic
   diseases. One of the strongest associations in each case is inflammatory
   bowel disease (IBD), but disease risk cannot be explained fully by
   either factor individually. Recent findings point to interactions
   between host genetics and microbial exposures as important contributors
   to disease risk in IBD. These include evidence of the partial
   heritability of the gut microbiota and the conferral of gut mucosal
   inflammation by microbiome transplant even when the dysbiosis was
   initially genetically derived. Although there have been several tests
   for association of individual genetic loci with bacterial taxa, there
   has been no direct comparison of complex genome-microbiome associations
   in large cohorts of patients with an immunity-related disease.
   Methods: We obtained 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences from
   intestinal biopsies as well as host genotype via Immunochip in three
   independent cohorts totaling 474 individuals. We tested for correlation
   between relative abundance of bacterial taxa and number of minor alleles
   at known IBD risk loci, including fine mapping of multiple risk alleles
   in the Nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2
   (NOD2) gene exon. We identified host polymorphisms whose associations
   with bacterial taxa were conserved across two or more cohorts, and we
   tested related genes for enrichment of host functional pathways.
   Results: We identified and confirmed in two cohorts a significant
   association between NOD2 risk allele count and increased relative
   abundance of Enterobacteriaceae, with directionality of the effect
   conserved in the third cohort. Forty-eight additional IBD-related SNPs
   have directionality of their associations with bacterial taxa
   significantly conserved across two or three cohorts, implicating genes
   enriched for regulation of innate immune response, the JAK-STAT cascade,
   and other immunity-related pathways.
   Conclusions: These results suggest complex interactions between
   genetically altered host functional pathways and the structure of the
   microbiome. Our findings demonstrate the ability to uncover novel
   associations from paired genome-microbiome data, and they suggest a
   complex link between host genetics and microbial dysbiosis in subjects
   with IBD across independent cohorts.}},

   effect of gas flow rate and substrate}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The effluent of an RF argon atmospheric pressure plasma jet, the
   so-called kinpen, is investigated with focus on the nitric-oxide (NO)
   distribution for laminar and turbulent flow regimes. An additional dry
   air gas curtain is applied around the plasma effluent to prevent
   interaction with the ambient humid air. By means of laser-induced
   fluorescence (LIF) the absolute spatially resolved NO density is
   measured as well as the rotational temperature and the air
   concentration. While in the laminar case, the transport of NO is
   attributed to thermal diffusion; in the turbulent case, turbulent mixing
   is responsible for air diffusion. Additionally, measurements with a
   molecular beam mass-spectrometer (MBMS) absolutely calibrated for NO are
   performed and compared with the LIF measurements. Discrepancies are
   explained by the contribution of the NO2 and N2O to the MBMS NO signal.
   Finally, the effect of a conductive substrate in front of the plasma jet
   on the spatial distribution of NO and air diffusion is also
   investigated.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{113}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Human crowds often bear a striking resemblance to interacting particle
   systems, and this has prompted many researchers to describe pedestrian
   dynamics in terms of interaction forces and potential energies. The
   correct quantitative form of this interaction, however, has remained an
   open question. Here, we introduce a novel statistical-mechanical
   approach to directly measure the interaction energy between pedestrians.
   This analysis, when applied to a large collection of human motion data,
   reveals a simple power-law interaction that is based not on the physical
   separation between pedestrians but on their projected time to a
   potential future collision, and is therefore fundamentally anticipatory
   in nature. Remarkably, this simple law is able to describe human
   interactions across a wide variety of situations, speeds, and densities.
   We further show, through simulations, that the interaction law we
   identify is sufficient to reproduce many known crowd phenomena.}},

Title = {{Measuring Microarchitectural Details of Multi- and Many-Core Memory
   Systems through Microbenchmarking}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As multicore and many-core architectures evolve, their memory systems
   are becoming increasingly more complex. To bridge the latency and
   bandwidth gap between the processor and memory, they often use a mix of
   multilevel private/shared caches that are either blocking or nonblocking
   and are connected by high-speed network-on-chip. Moreover, they also
   incorporate hardware and software prefetching and simultaneous
   multithreading (SMT) to hide memory latency. On such multi- and
   many-core systems, to incorporate various memory optimization schemes
   using compiler optimizations and performance tuning techniques, it is
   crucial to have microarchitectural details of the target memory system.
   Unfortunately, such details are often unavailable from vendors,
   especially for newly released processors.
   In this article, we propose a novel microbenchmarking methodology based
   on short elapsed-time events (SETEs) to obtain comprehensive memory
   microarchitectural details in multi-and many-core processors. This
   approach requires detailed analysis of potential interfering factors
   that could affect the intended behavior of such memory systems. We lay
   out effective guidelines to control and mitigate those interfering
   factors. Taking the impact of SMT into consideration, our proposed
   methodology not only can measure traditional cache/memory latency and
   off-chip bandwidth but also can uncover the details of software and
   hardware prefetching units not attempted in previous studies. Using the
   newly released Intel Xeon Phi many-core processor (with in-order cores)
   as an example, we show how we can use a set of microbenchmarks to
   determine various microarchitectural features of its memory system (many
   are undocumented from vendors). To demonstrate the portability and
   validate the correctness of such a methodology, we use the
   well-documented Intel Sandy Bridge multicore processor (with
   out-of-order cores) as another example, where most data are available
   and can be validated. Moreover, to illustrate the usefulness of the
   measured data, we do a multistage coordinated data prefetching case
   study on both Xeon Phi and Sandy Bridge and show that by using the
   measured data, we can achieve 1.3X and 1.08X performance speedup,
   respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art Intel ICC compiler. We
   believe that these measurements also provide useful insights into memory
   optimization, analysis, and modeling of such multicore and many-core
   architectures.}},

Abstract = {{Vascular disease is a leading cause of death globally and typically
   manifests chronically due to long-term maladaptive arterial growth and
   remodeling. To date, there is no in vitro technique for studying
   vascular function over relevant disease time courses that both mimics in
   vivo-like tissue structure and provides a simple readout of tissue
   stress. We aimed to extend tissue viability in our muscular thin film
   contractility assay by modifying the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   substrate with micropatterned genipin, allowing extracellular matrix
   turnover without cell loss. To achieve this, we developed a microfluidic
   delivery system to pattern genipin and extracellular matrix proteins on
   PDMS prior to cell seeding. Tissues constructed using this method showed
   improved viability and maintenance of in vivo-like lamellar structure.
   Functional contractility of tissues fabricated on genipin-modified
   substrates remained consistent throughout two weeks in culture. These
   results suggest that muscular thin films with genipin-modified PDMS
   substrates are a viable method for conducting functional studies of
   arterial growth and remodeling in vascular diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Thin films comprising semiconductor nanocrystals are emerging for
   applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices including light
   emitting diodes and solar cells. Achieving high charge carrier mobility
   in these films requires the identification and elimination of electronic
   traps on the nanocrystal surfaces. Herein, we show that in films
   comprising ZnO nanocrystals, an electron acceptor trap related to the
   presence of OH on the surface limits the conductivity. ZnO nanocrystal
   films were synthesized using a nonthermal plasma from diethyl zinc and
   oxygen and deposited by inertial impaction onto a variety of substrates.
   Surprisingly, coating the ZnO nanocrystals with a few nanometres of
   Al2O3 using atomic layer deposition decreased the film resistivity by
   seven orders of magnitude to values as low as 0.12 Omega cm. Electron
   mobility as high as 3 cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) was observed in films comprising
   annealed ZnO nanocrystals coated with Al2O3.}},

Journal = {{AIP ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, Co-W thin films deposited by DC magnetron sputtering were
   demonstrated to be perpendicular magnetic anisotropic with large
   magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE). Thermodynamic calculations
   based on Miedema's semiempirical model have been used to estimate the
   phase in this binary alloy system. Based on the thermodynamic
   calculations results, a series of Co-W thin films were deposited on
   amorphous Ta underlayer with different tungsten concentrations.
   According to the X-ray diffraction results, the crystal structure of
   Co-W thin films is consistent well with that of thermodynamic
   calculations. Large MAE of Co-W thin films can be obtained with K-u over
   2.1 x 10(5) J/m(3) after vacuum annealing. The perpendicular coercivity
   (H-c) of Co-W thin film reaches 9.1 x 10(4) A/m. Therefore, the Co-W
   thin film is considered as a potential choice of high-density magnetic
   recording media materials. (C) 2014 Author(s). All article content,

Abstract = {{The potential of using fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator (FDSOI)
   devices as dosimeters for radiation cancer therapy is investigated. The
   response of long-channel FDSOIMOSFETs to radiation from a linear
   accelerator under various clinical conditions has been measured. Linear
   response of the device threshold voltage, Vth, is observed for typical
   interventional energy X-rays up to absorbed doses as high as 160 Gy. The
   device response is observed to be strongly influenced by the application
   of a substrate bias, V-bg, with sensitivity improvements of up to 20x
   observed for V-bg = +5 V compared to V-bg = 0. The results have been
   used to calibrate numerical simulations that show the design space for
   using FDSOI variable capacitors (varactors) as passive wireless
   radiation dosimeters suitable for in vivo implantation. Simulation
   studies show that a design space exists to realize wireless sensors with
   both high quality factor (Q > 20 at 1 GHz) and good sensitivity (Delta
   f/f = 0.12 \%/Gy). These results indicate the promise of FDSOI to
   realize a new, convenient class of in vivo dosimeters for radiation

Abstract = {{As a key approach to achieve energy efficiency in sensor networks,
   sensing coverage has been studied extensively in the literature.
   Researchers have designed many coverage protocols to provide various
   kinds of service guarantees on the network lifetime, coverage ratio and
   detection delay. While these protocols are effective, they are not
   flexible enough to meet multiple design goals simultaneously. In this
   paper, we propose a unified sensing coverage architecture for duty
   cycled wireless sensor networks, called uSense, which features three
   novel ideas: Asymmetric Architecture, Generic Switching and Global
   Scheduling. We propose asymmetric architecture based on the conceptual
   separation of switching from scheduling. Switching is efficiently
   supported in sensor nodes, while scheduling is done in a separated
   computational entity, where multiple scheduling algorithms are
   supported. As an instance, we propose a two-level global coverage
   algorithm, called uScan. At the first level, coverage is scheduled to
   activate different portions of an area. We propose an optimal scheduling
   algorithm to minimize area breach. At the second level, sets of nodes
   are selected to cover active portions. Importantly, we show the
   feasibility to obtain optimal set-cover results in linear time if the
   layout of areas satisfies certain conditions. Through extensive testbed
   and simulation evaluations, we demonstrate that uSense is a promising
   architecture to support flexible and efficient coverage in sensor
   networks.}},

Abstract = {{Geocast in vehicular networks aims to deliver a message to a target
   geographical region, which is useful for many applications such as
   geographic advertising. This is a highly challenging task in vehicular
   network environments due to the rare encounter opportunities and
   uncertainty caused by vehicular mobility. As more vehicles are equipped
   with on-board navigation systems, vehicle trajectories are ready for
   exploitation. We observe that a vehicle has a higher capability of
   delivering a message to the target region if its own future trajectory
   or trajectories of those vehicles to be encountered overlap the target
   region. Motivated by this observation, we develop a message forwarding
   metric, called coverage capability, to characterize the capability of a
   vehicle to successfully geocast the message. When calculating the
   coverage capability, we are facing the major challenge raised by the
   absence of accurate vehicle arrival time. Through an empirical study
   using real vehicular GPS traces of 2,600 taxis, we verify that the
   travel time of a vehicle, which is modeled as a random variable, follows
   the Gamma distribution. The travel time modeling helps us to make
   accurate predictions for inter-vehicle encounters. We perform extensive
   trace-driven simulations and the results show that our approach achieves
   37.4 percent higher delivery ratio and 43.1 percent lower transmission
   overhead comparing with GPSR which is a representative geographic
   routing protocol.}},

Abstract = {{Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, known together as inflammatory
   bowel disease (IBD), are severe autoimmune disorders now causing gut
   inflammation and ulceration, among other symptoms, in up to 1 in 250
   people worldwide. Incidence and prevalence of IBD have been increasing
   dramatically over the past several decades, although the causes for this
   increase are still unknown. IBD has both a complex genotype and a
   complex phenotype, and although it has received substantial attention
   from the medical research community over recent years, much of the
   etiology remains unexplained. Genome-wide association studies have
   identified a rich genetic signature of disease risk in patients with
   IBD, consisting of at least 163 genetic loci. Many of these loci contain
   genes directly involved in microbial handling, indicating that the
   genetic architecture of the disease has been driven by host microbe
   interactions. In addition, systematic shifts in gut microbiome structure
   (enterotype) and function have been observed in patients with IBD.
   Furthermore, both the host genotype and enterotype are associated with
   aspects of the disease phenotype, including location of the disease.
   This provides strong evidence of interactions between host genotype and
   enterotype; however, there is a lack of published multi-omics data from
   IBD patients, and a lack of bioinformatics tools for modeling such
   systems. In this article we discuss, from a computational biologist's
   point of view, the potential benefits of and the challenges involved in
   designing and analyzing such multi-omics studies of IBD. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{The processing of massive amounts of data on clusters with finite amount
   of memory has become an important problem facing the
   parallel/distributed computing community. While MapReduce-style
   technologies provide an effective means for addressing various problems
   that fit within the MapReduce paradigm, there are many classes of
   problems for which this paradigm is ill-suited. In this paper we present
   a runtime system for traditional MPI programs that enables the efficient
   and transparent out-of-core execution of distributed-memory parallel
   programs. This system, called BDMPI,(1) leverages the semantics of MPI's
   API to orchestrate the execution of a large number of MPI processes on
   much fewer compute nodes, so that the running processes maximize the
   amount of computation that they perform with the data fetched from the
   disk. BDMPI enables the development of efficient out-of-core parallel
   distributed memory codes without the high engineering and algorithmic
   complexities associated with multiple levels of blocking. BDMPI achieves
   significantly better performance than existing technologies on a single
   node as well as on a small cluster, and performs within 30\% of
   optimized out-of-core implementations. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Motivated by the use of electrostatic assist to improve liquid transfer
   in gravure printing, we use theory and experiment to understand how
   electric fields deform thin liquid films near surfaces with cavity-like
   topographical features. Lubrication theory is used to describe the film
   dynamics, and both perfect and leaky dielectric materials are
   considered. For sinusoidal cavities, we apply asymptotic methods to
   obtain analytical results that relate the film deformation to the other
   problem parameters. For trapezoidal-like cavities, we numerically solve
   evolution equations to study the influence of steep topographical
   features and the spacing between cavities. Results from flow
   visualization experiments are in qualitative agreement with the
   theoretical predictions. In addition to being relevant to printing
   processes, the model problems we consider are also of fundamental
   interest in and represent novel contributions to the areas of
   electrohydrodynamics and thin-liquid-film flows. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{One of the most uncertain parameters in stepped spillway design is the
   length (from the crest) of boundary layer development. The normal
   velocity profiles responding to the steps as bed roughness are
   investigated in the developing non-aerated flow region. A detailed
   analysis of the logarithmic vertical velocity profiles on stepped
   spillways is conducted through experimental data to verify the
   computational code and numerical experiments to expand the data
   available. To determine development length, the hydraulic roughness and
   displacement thickness, along with the shear velocity, are needed. This
   includes determining displacement height d and surface roughness length
   z(0) and the relationship of d and z(0) to the step geometry. The
   results show that the hydraulic roughness height k(s) is the primary
   factor on which d and z(0) depend. In different step height, step width,
   discharge and intake Froude number, the relations d/k(s) = 0.22-0.27,
   z(0)/k(s) = 0.06-0.1 and d/z(0) = 2.2-4 result in a good estimate. Using
   the computational code and numerical experiments, air inception will
   occur over stepped spillway flow as long as the Bauer-defined boundary
   layer thickness is between 0.72 and 0.79.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling the dynamics of a confined, semiflexible polymer is a
   challenging problem, owing to the complicated interplay between the
   configurations of the chain, which are strongly affected by the length
   scale for the confinement relative to the persistence length of the
   chain, and the polymer-wall hydrodynamic interactions. At the same time,
   understanding these dynamics are crucial to the advancement of emerging
   genomic technologies that use confinement to stretch out DNA and
   ``read{''} a genomic signature. In this mini-review, we begin by
   considering what is known experimentally and theoretically about the
   friction of a wormlike chain such as DNA confined in a slit or a
   channel. We then discuss how to estimate the friction coefficient of
   such a chain, either with dynamic simulations or via Monte Carlo
   sampling and the Kirkwood pre-averaging approximation. We then review
   our recent work on computing the diffusivity of DNA in nanoslits and
   nanochannels, and conclude with some promising avenues for future work
   and caveats about our approach.}},

Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{12}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Steady state kinetics and measured pyridine inhibition of ethanol
   dehydration and dehydrogenation rates on gamma-alumina above 623 K show
   that ethanol dehydrogenation can be described with an indirect hydrogen
   transfer mechanism to form acetaldehyde and ethane and that this
   mechanism proceeds through a shared surface intermediate with ethylene
   synthesis from ethanol dehydration. Ethane is produced at a rate within
   experimental error of acetaldehyde production, demonstrating that ethane
   is a coproduct of acetaldehyde synthesis from ethanol dehydrogenation.
   Steady state kinetic measurements indicate that acetaldehyde synthesis
   rates above 623 K are independent of co-fed water partial pressure up to
   1.7 kPa and possess an ethanol partial pressure dependence between 0 and
   1 (P-ethanol = 1.0-16.2 kPa), consistent with ethanol dehydrogenation
   rates being inhibited only by ethanol monomer surface species. The
   surface density of catalytically active sites for ethylene and diethyl
   ether production were estimated from in situ pyridine titration
   experiments to be similar to 0.2 and similar to 4.8 sites nm(-2),
   respectively, at 623 K. Primary kinetic isotope effects for ethylene and
   acetaldehyde are measured only when the C-H bonds of ethanol are
   deuterated, verifying that C-H bond cleavage is kinetically limiting for
   both products. The proposed indirect hydrogen transfer model for
   acetaldehyde synthesis is consistent with experimentally observed
   reaction rate dependences and kinetic isotope effects and highlights the
   complementary role of hydrogen adatom removal pathways in the formation
   of aldehydes on Lewis acidic systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cationic polyelectrolyte doped hollow nanofibers prepared via facial
   coaxial electrospinning technology have been used for positional
   assembly of two enzymes, glucose oxidase (GOD) and Candida antactica
   lipase B (CALB), at two different positions, namely, in their lumen and
   on their surface. Therefore, the result is four combinations, including
   lumen (GOD+CALB), surface (GOD+CALB), surface (GOD)-lumen (CALB), and
   lumen (GOD)-surface (CALB). Surface attachment of enzymes was achieved
   by layer-by-layer (LbL) technology, which is based on the ion-exchange
   interactions between oppositely charged enzymes and polyelectrolyte that
   was doped in hollow nanofibers; whereas placing enzymes inside the lumen
   of hollow nanofibers was realized by in situ encapsulation during
   coelectrospinning. The hollow nanofibers-based biencyine systems were
   used for a cascade reaction in an oil-aqueous biphasic system, in which
   glucose was oxidized by GOD to generate H2O2, which was used as
   substrate and oxidant for CALB-catalyzed epoxidation of oleic acid in
   the second step. The bienzyme nanofibers membrane was found to float
   spontaneously at the O/W interface, which is advantageous to biphasic
   biocatalysis. Assembly strategies of the two enzymes affect their
   biocatalytic efficiency significantly by influencing the utilization
   efficiency of H2O2 in the reaction process. The highest reaction rate
   was attained by lumen (GOD)-surface (CALB), corresponding to 114.45
   times enhancement as compared to that of the free bienzyme system.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric technology is the backbone of most medical ultrasound
   imaging arrays; however, signal transduction efficiency severely
   deteriorates in scaling the technology to element size smaller than 0.1
   mm, often required for high-frequency operation (> 20 MHz). Optical
   sensing and generation of ultrasound has been proposed and studied as an
   alternative technology for implementing sub-millimeter size arrays with
   element size down to 10 mu m. The application of thin polymer film
   Fabry-Perot resonators has been demonstrated for high-frequency
   ultrasound detection; however, their sensitivity is limited by light
   diffraction loss. Here, we introduce a new method to increase the
   sensitivity of an optical ultrasound receiver by utilizing a waveguide
   between the mirrors of the Fabry-Perot resonator. This approach
   eliminates diffraction loss from the cavity, and therefore the finesse
   is only limited by mirror loss and absorption. By applying this method,
   we have achieved noise equivalent pressure of 178 Pa over a bandwidth of
   30 MHz or 0.03 Pa/Hz(1/2), which is about 20-fold better than a similar
   device without a waveguide. The finesse of the tested Fabry-Perot
   resonator was around 200. This result is 5 times higher than the finesse
   measured in the same device outside the waveguide region.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Deficits in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibitory
   neurotransmission have been associated with pathophysiological
   mechanisms underlying schizophrenia. However, little is known about
   whether these deficits occur before or after the onset of psychosis.
   Method: We recruited 16 drug-naive subjects at ultra-high risk of
   psychosis (UHR), 17 schizophrenia patients and 28 healthy controls.
   Cortical inhibition was determined using transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (TMS) over the left primary motor cortex. TMS markers such
   as short-interval cortical inhibition (SICI), cortical silent period
   (CSP) and intracortical facilitation (ICF) were obtained from each
   subject. While SICI can reflect GABA type A (GABA(A)) mediated
   inhibition, CSP is thought to indicate GABA type B (GABA(B)) mediated
   inhibitory circuits.
   Results: As compared with healthy controls, UHR subjects showed a
   prolonged CSP with no change in SICI, whereas schizophrenia patients
   demonstrated both a prolonged CSP and a reduced SICI. No group
   differences were found for ICF. CSP in schizophrenia patients also had a
   positive correlation with positive symptom score of the positive and
   negative symptom scale (PANSS).
   Conclusions: Cortical inhibitory deficits among UHR subjects were
   relatively limited compared to those among schizophrenia patients.
   Alterations might occur in some subgroup of GABA-mediated
   neurotransmitter systems before the onset of psychosis, while
   alterations in both GABA(A) and GABA(B) networks might contribute to
   full blown psychosis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on hot-carrier effects in modern CMOS technologies
   and proposes a scalable method for analyzing circuit-level delay
   degradations in large digital circuits, using methods that take
   abstractions up from the transistor to the circuit level. We begin with
   an exposition of our approach for the nominal case. At the transistor
   level, a multimode energy-driven model for nanometer technologies is
   employed. At the logic cell level, a methodology that captures the aging
   of a device as a sum of device age gains per signal transition is
   described, and the age gain is characterized using SPICE simulation. At
   the circuit level, the cell-level characterizations are used in
   conjunction with probabilistic methods to perform fast degradation
   analysis. Next, we extend the nominal case analysis to include the
   effect of process variations. Finally, we show the composite effect of
   these approaches in the presence of other aging variations, notably bias
   temperature instability, and study the relative impact of each component
   of aging on the temporal trends of circuit delay degradations. The
   analysis approaches for nominal and variational cases are both validated
   by Monte Carlo simulation on various benchmark circuits, and are proved
   to be accurate, efficient, and scalable.}},

   for tinnitus}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Objective. The inferior colliculus (IC) is the primary processing center
   of auditory information in the midbrain and is one site of
   tinnitus-related activity. One potential option for suppressing the
   tinnitus percept is through deep brain stimulation via the auditory
   midbrain implant (AMI), which is designed for hearing restoration and is
   already being implanted in deaf patients who also have tinnitus.
   However, to assess the feasibility of AMI stimulation for tinnitus
   treatment we first need to characterize the functional connectivity
   within the IC. Previous studies have suggested modulatory projections
   from the dorsal cortex of the IC (ICD) to the central nucleus of the IC
   (ICC), though the functional properties of these projections need to be
   determined. Approach. In this study, we investigated the effects of
   electrical stimulation of the ICD on acoustic-driven activity within the
   ICC in ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs. Main Results. We observed ICD
   stimulation induces both suppressive and facilitatory changes across ICC
   that can occur immediately during stimulation and remain after
   stimulation. Additionally, ICD stimulation paired with broadband noise
   stimulation at a specific delay can induce greater suppressive than
   facilitatory effects, especially when stimulating in more rostral and
   medial ICD locations. Significance. These findings demonstrate that ICD
   stimulation can induce specific types of plastic changes in ICC
   activity, which may be relevant for treating tinnitus. By using the AMI
   with electrode sites positioned with the ICD and the ICC, the modulatory
   effects of ICD stimulation can be tested directly in tinnitus patients.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal denaturation of proteins is critical to cell injury, food
   science and other biomaterial processing. For example protein
   denaturation correlates strongly with cell death by heating, and is
   increasingly of interest in focal thermal therapies of cancer and other
   diseases at temperatures which often exceed 50 A degrees C. The
   Arrhenius model is a simple yet widely used model for both protein
   denaturation and cell injury. To establish the utility of the Arrhenius
   model for protein denaturation at 50 A degrees C and above its
   sensitivities to the kinetic parameters (activation energy E (a) and
   frequency factor A) were carefully examined. We propose a simplified
   correlated parameter fit to the Arrhenius model by treating E (a), as an
   independent fitting parameter and allowing A to follow dependently. The
   utility of the correlated parameter fit is demonstrated on thermal
   denaturation of proteins and cells from the literature as a validation,
   and new experimental measurements in our lab using FTIR spectroscopy to
   demonstrate broad applicability of this method. Finally, we demonstrate
   that the end-temperature within which the denaturation is measured is
   important and changes the kinetics. Specifically, higher E (a) and A
   parameters were found at low end-temperature (50 A degrees C) and reduce
   as end-temperatures increase to 70 A degrees C. This trend is consistent
   with Arrhenius parameters for cell injury in the literature that are
   significantly higher for clonogenics (45-50 A degrees C) vs. membrane
   dye assays (60-70 A degrees C). Future opportunities to monitor cell
   injury by spectroscopic measurement of protein denaturation are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The production of methylmercury (MeHg), a bioaccumulative neurotoxin, in
   freshwater systems is primarily driven by naturally occurring sulfate
   reducing bacteria in anoxic sediment and waters. This research used
   laboratory microcosms to examine the influence of sulfate on MeHg
   production and partitioning in sulfate-impacted freshwater estuary
   sediment. A laboratory sulfate addition experiment exposed 20 cm
   diameter intact sediment cores with varying organic carbon content to
   sulfate concentrations in the overlying water ranging from 5 to 50 mg L
   (1). Results from the 6 month incubation suggest that net MeHg
   production in sediment from open-water areas of the St. Louis River
   Estuary was not directly related to overlying water sulfate. Mercury
   mobility, as indicated by porewater concentrations, appeared to be
   related to the quantity of organic carbon and sulfur in sediment.
   Laboratory flux estimates were consistent with porewater concentrations
   and provided a means to compare diffusion-driven MeHg loading from
   sediment to MeHg loading from upstream sources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{State estimation (SE) is an important task allowing power networks to
   monitor accurately the underlying system state, which is useful for
   security-constrained dispatch and power system control. For nonlinear AC
   power systems, SE amounts to minimizing a weighted least-squares cost
   that is inherently nonconvex, thus giving rise to many local optima. As
   a result, estimators used extensively in practice rely on iterative
   optimization methods, which are destined to return only locally optimal
   solutions, or even fail to converge. A semidefinite programming (SDP)
   formulation for SE has been advocated, which relies on the convex
   semidefinite relaxation (SDR) of the original problem and thereby
   renders it efficiently solvable. Theoretical analysis under simplified
   conditions is provided to shed light on the near-optimal performance of
   the SDR-based SE solution at polynomial complexity. The new approach is
   further pursued toward complementing traditional nonlinear measurements
   with linear synchrophasor measurements and reducing computational
   complexity through distributed implementations. Numerical tests on the
   standard IEEE 30- and 118-bus systems corroborate that the SE algorithms
   outperform existing alternatives, and approach near-optimal performance.}},

Abstract = {{The smart grid vision entails advanced information technology and data
   analytics to enhance the efficiency, sustainability, and economics of
   the power grid infrastructure. Aligned to this end, modern statistical
   learning tools are leveraged here for electricity market inference.
   Day-ahead price forecasting is cast as a low-rank kernel learning
   problem. Uniquely exploiting the market clearing process, congestion
   patterns are modeled as rank-one components in the matrix of
   spatio-temporally varying prices. Through a novel nuclear norm-based
   regularization, kernels across pricing nodes and hours can be
   systematically selected. Even though market-wide forecasting is
   beneficial from a learning perspective, it involves processing
   high-dimensional market data. The latter becomes possible after devising
   a block-coordinate descent algorithm for solving the non-convex
   optimization problem involved. The algorithm utilizes results from
   block-sparse vector recovery and is guaranteed to converge to a
   stationary point. Numerical tests on real data from the Midwest ISO
   (MISO) market corroborate the prediction accuracy, computational
   efficiency, and the interpretative merits of the developed approach over
   existing alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Computationally efficient and scalable models that describe
   droop-controlled inverter dynamics are key to modeling, analysis, and
   control in islanded microgrids. Typical models developed from first
   principles in this domain describe detailed dynamics of the power
   electronics inverters, as well as the network interactions.
   Consequently, these models are very involved; they offer limited
   analytical insights and are computationally expensive when applied to
   investigate the dynamics of large microgrids with many inverters. This
   calls for the development of reduced-order models that capture the
   relevant dynamics of higher order models with a lower dimensional state
   space while not compromising modeling fidelity. To this end, this paper
   proposes model-reduction methods based on singular perturbation and Kron
   reduction to reduce large-signal dynamic models of inverter-based
   islanded microgrids in temporal and spatial aspects, respectively. The
   reduced-order models are tested in a modified IEEE 37-bus system and
   verified to accurately describe the original dynamics with lower
   computational burden. In addition, we demonstrate that Kron reduction
   isolates the mutual inverter interactions and the equivalent loads that
   the inverters have to support in the microgrid-this aspect is leveraged
   in the systematic selection of droop coefficients to minimize power
   losses and voltage deviations.}},

Abstract = {{Decentralized methods for computing optimal real and reactive power
   setpoints for residential photovoltaic (PV) inverters are developed in
   this paper. It is known that conventional PV inverter controllers, which
   are designed to extract maximum power at unity power factor, cannot
   address secondary performance objectives such as voltage regulation and
   network loss minimization. Optimal power flow techniques can be utilized
   to select which inverters will provide ancillary services and to compute
   their optimal real and reactive power setpoints according to
   well-defined performance criteria and economic objectives. Lever-aging
   advances in sparsity-promoting regularization techniques and
   semidefinite relaxation, this paper shows how such problems can be
   solved with reduced computational burden and optimality guarantees. To
   enable large-scale implementation, a novel algorithmic framework is
   introduced-based on the so-called alternating direction method of
   multipliers-by which optimal power flow-type problems in this setting
   can be systematically decomposed into subproblems that can be solved in
   a decentralized fashion by the utility and customer-owned PV systems
   with limited exchanges of information. Since the computational burden is
   shared among multiple devices and the requirement of all-to-all
   communication can be circumvented, the proposed optimization approach
   scales favorably to large distribution networks.}},

Abstract = {{Compression wood represents a unique challenge for biochemical
   processing of sustainable biomass to produce biofuels and bioproducts on
   account of its highly lignified tracheids relative to opposite wood. In
   the current work, differentiating response of Pinus bungeana Zucc.
   compression wood and opposite wood tracheid walls to dilute acid
   pretreatment was elucidated by combining chemical and microscopic
   approaches. Dilute acid pretreatment released greater amount of
   hemicelluloses from opposite wood (91.0\%) than from compression wood
   (31.2\%). The dissolution of hemicelluloses was not uniform and varied
   across the tracheid wall. In addition, for both compression wood and
   opposite wood the heterogeneity in lignin distribution was enhanced,
   probably attributed to the lignin migration and relocalization. The
   ultrastructural arrangement of the cell wall was also altered with the
   pretreated opposite wood tracheid wall exposing more apparent cellulose
   microfibril bundles and less abundant globular structures compared to
   compression wood. The dilute acid pretreatment demonstrated that the
   greater recalcitrance of compression wood probably originated from the
   higher lignin content and the resulting more compact structure of the
   cell wall. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Effect of Heating Rate and Kinetic Model Selection on Activation Energy

Abstract = {{The nonisothermal crystallization kinetics of amorphous materials is
   routinely analyzed by statistically fitting the crystallization data to
   kinetic models. In this work, we systematically evaluate how the
   model-dependent crystallization kinetics is impacted by variations in
   the heating rate and the selection of the kinetic model, two key factors
   that can lead to significant differences in the crystallization
   activation energy (E-a) of an amorphous material. Using amorphous
   felodipine, we show that the E-a decreases with increase in the heating
   rate, irrespective of the kinetic model evaluated in this work. The
   model that best describes the crystallization phenomenon cannot be
   identified readily through the statistical fitting approach because
   several kinetic models yield comparable R-2. Here, we propose an
   alternate paired model-fitting model-free (PMFMF) approach for
   identifying the most suitable kinetic model, where E-a obtained from
   model-dependent kinetics is compared with those obtained from model-free
   kinetics. The most suitable kinetic model is identified as the one that
   yields E-a values comparable with the model-free kinetics. Through this
   PMFMF approach, nucleation and growth is identified as the main
   mechanism that controls the crystallization kinetics of felodipine.
   Using this PMFMF approach, we further demonstrate that crystallization
   mechanism from amorphous phase varies with heating rate. (c) 2014 Wiley

Title = {{A Novel Bioreactor for Mechanobiological Studies of Engineered Heart
   Valve Tissue Formation Under Pulmonary Arterial Physiological Flow

Abstract = {{The ability to replicate physiological hemodynamic conditions during in
   vitro tissue development has been recognized as an important aspect in
   the development and in vitro assessment of engineered heart valve
   tissues. Moreover, we have demonstrated that studies aiming to
   understand mechanical conditioning require separation of the major heart
   valve deformation loading modes: flow, stretch, and flexure (FSF) (Sacks
   et al., 2009, ``Bioengineering Challenges for Heart Valve Tissue
   Engineering,{''} Annu. Rev. Biomed. Eng., 11(1), pp. 289-313). To
   achieve these goals in a novel bioreactor design, we utilized a
   cylindrical conduit configuration for the conditioning chamber to allow
   for higher fluid velocities, translating to higher shear stresses on the
   in situ tissue specimens while retaining laminar flow conditions. Moving
   boundary computational fluid dynamic (CFD) simulations were performed to
   predict the flow field under combined cyclic flexure and steady flow
   (cyclic-flex-flow) states using various combinations of flow rate, and
   media viscosity. The device was successfully constructed and tested for
   incubator housing, gas exchange, and sterility. In addition, we
   performed a pilot experiment using biodegradable polymer scaffolds
   seeded with bone marrow derived stem cells (BMSCs) at a seeding density
   of 5 x 10(6) cells/cm(2). The constructs were subjected to combined
   cyclic flexure (1 Hz frequency) and steady flow (Re = 1376; flow rate of
   1.06 l/min (LPM); shear stress in the range of 0-9 dynes/cm(2)) for 2
   weeks to permit physiological shear stress conditions. Assays revealed
   significantly (P < 0.05) higher amounts of collagen (20516256 mu g/g) at
   the end of 2 weeks in comparison to similar experiments previously
   conducted in our laboratory but performed at subphysiological levels of
   shear stress (<2 dynes/cm(2); Engelmayr et al., 2006, ``Cyclic Flexure
   and Laminar Flow Synergistically Accelerate Mesenchymal Stem
   Cell-Mediated Engineered Tissue Formation: Implications for Engineered
   Heart Valve Tissues,{''} Biomaterials, 27(36), pp. 6083-6095). The
   implications of this novel design are that fully coupled or decoupled
   physiological flow, flexure, and stretch modes of engineered tissue
   conditioning investigations can be readily accomplished with the
   inclusion of this device in experimental protocols on engineered heart
   valve tissue formation.}},

Abstract = {{In a top-k Geometric Intersection Query (top-k GIQ) problem, a set of n
   weighted, geometric objects in R-d is to be preprocessed into a compact
   data structure so that for any query geometric object, q, and integer k
   > 0, the k largest-weight objects intersected by q can be reported
   efficiently. While the top-k problem has been studied extensively for
   non-geometric problems (e. g., recommender systems), the geometric
   version has received little attention. This paper gives a general
   technique to solve any top-k GIQ problem efficiently. The technique
   relies only on the availability of an efficient solution for the
   underlying (non-top-k) GIQ problem, which is often the case. Using this,
   asymptotically efficient solutions are derived for several top-k GIQ
   problems, including top-k orthogonal and circular range search, point
   enclosure search, halfspace range search, etc. Implementations of some
   of these solutions, using practical data structures, show that they are
   quite efficient in practice. This paper also does a formal investigation
   of the hardness of the top-k GIQ problem, which reveals interesting
   connections between the top-k GIQ problem and the underlying (non-top-k)
   GIQ problem.}},

Abstract = {{Efficacy of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for motor signs of Parkinson's
   disease (PD) depends in part on post-operative programming of stimulus
   parameters. There is a need for a systematic approach to tuning
   parameters based on patient physiology. We used a physiologically
   realistic computational model of the basal ganglia network to
   investigate the emergence of a 34 Hz oscillation in the PD state and its
   optimal suppression with DBS. Discrete time transfer functions were fit
   to post-stimulus time histograms (PSTHs) collected in open-loop, by
   simulating the pharmacological block of synaptic connections, to
   describe the behavior of the basal ganglia nuclei. These functions were
   then connected to create a mean-field model of the closed-loop system,
   which was analyzed to determine the origin of the emergent 34 Hz
   pathological oscillation. This analysis determined that the oscillation
   could emerge from the coupling between the globus pallidus external
   (GPe) and subthalamic nucleus (STN). When coupled, the two resonate with
   each other in the PD state but not in the healthy state. By
   characterizing how this oscillation is affected by subthreshold DBS
   pulses, we hypothesize that it is possible to predict stimulus
   frequencies capable of suppressing this oscillation. To characterize the
   response to the stimulus, we developed a new method for estimating phase
   response curves (PRCs) from population data. Using the population PRC we
   were able to predict frequencies that enhance and suppress the 34 Hz
   pathological oscillation. This provides a systematic approach to tuning
   DBS frequencies and could enable closed-loop tuning of stimulation
   parameters.}},

Abstract = {{Given a simple noun such as apple, and a question such as ``Is it
   edible?,'' what processes take place in the human brain? More
   specifically, given the stimulus, what are the interactions between
   (groups of) neurons (also known as functional connectivity) and how can
   we automatically infer those interactions, given measurements of the
   brain activity? Furthermore, how does this connectivity differ across
   different human subjects?
   In this work, we show that this problem, even though originating from
   the field of neuroscience, can benefit from big data techniques; we
   present a simple, novel good-enough brain model, or GEBM in short, and a
   novel algorithm Sparse-SysId, which are able to effectively model the
   dynamics of the neuron interactions and infer the functional
   connectivity. Moreover, GEBM is able to simulate basic psychological
   phenomena such as habituation and priming (whose definition we provide
   in the main text).
   We evaluate GEBM by using real brain data. GEBM produces brain activity
   patterns that are strikingly similar to the real ones, where the
   inferred functional connectivity is able to provide neuroscientific
   insights toward a better understanding of the way that neurons interact
   with each other, as well as detect regularities and outliers in
   multisubject brain activity measurements.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a joint timing synchronization and channel
   estimation scheme for multiple-input single-output or multiple-input
   multiple-output communication systems. All timing offsets and channel
   impulse responses (CIR) of different transmit-receive links are obtained
   based on a well-designed training sequence arrangement. The proposed
   approach consists of three stages at each receive antenna. First, a
   coarse timing offset (CTO) estimation algorithm is performed to estimate
   the CTO and the inter-transmitter delays. Then, relative timing indices
   and the corresponding CIR estimates of all transmit-receive links at the
   second stage are obtained using the generalized maximum-likelihood
   estimation based on a sliding observation vector. Finally, the fine time
   adjustment based on the minimum mean-squared error criterion is
   performed. From the simulation results, the proposed approach has
   excellent timing synchronization performance under several channel
   models at very low signal-to-noise ratio which is smaller than 1 dB.
   Also, the channel estimation performance in the proposed scheme
   approaches to the Cramer-Rao bound. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   consisting of highly interconnected micropores and mesopores, catalyzed
   both of the parallel reactions in the mesopores. Pillared MFI and SPP
   catalyzed only the etherification reaction in the micropores as
   illustrated by the complete suppression of alkylation and retention of
   residual etherification activity after DTBP titration. Moreover, it was
   found that the external surface of MWW zeolites favors the alkylation
   reaction, while the etherification reaction takes place with similar
   reaction rates on MFI and MWW external surfaces. The evidence shown here
   for the assessment of external acid sites in catalyzing parallel
   reactions extends the scope of observed catalytic performances in these
   materials beyond those reflecting transport effects and accessibility of
   acid sites and highlights the importance of external surface structure.

Journal = {{ULTRAMICROSCOPY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{147}},
Pages = {{8-20}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Multislice simulations were used to analyze the reliability of annular
   dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (ADE-STEM) imaging
   and selected-area electron diffraction (SAED) for determining the
   thicknesses of MoS2 and WS2 specimens in the aberration-corrected TEM.
   Samples of 1 to 4 layers in thickness for both 2H and IT polymorphs were
   studied and tilts up to 500 mrad off of the {[}0001] zone axis were
   considered. All thicknesses including the monolayer showed distortions
   and intensity variations in their ADF-STEM images and SAED patterns as a
   result of tilt. Both techniques proved to be applicable to distinguish
   monolayers from multilayers using tilt. Without tilt, neither technique
   allows unambiguous thickness determination solely by comparing relative
   intensities of atomic columns in ADE-STEM images or diffraction patterns
   oriented along at {[}0001] zone axis, with the exception of monolayer 2H
   WS2. However, differentiation is possible using absolute intensities in
   ADF-STEM images. The analysis of ADF-STEM images and SAED patterns also
   allows identification of the 2H and IT polymorphs of MoS2 and WS2. (C)

Title = {{Establishing a sediment budget for a small agricultural catchment in

Abstract = {{The rapid expansion of agriculture in Brazil has increased erosion rates
   and sediment yields, causing many negative environmental and economic
   impacts, both on- and off-site. However, to date, very few
   catchment-scale sediment budget investigations have been carried out in
   Brazil. Given the need to reduce the negative off-site impacts of
   increasing agricultural activity, there is an important need for such
   investigations in order to inform the development of effective sediment
   management strategies. Against this background, Cs-137 measurements have
   been combined with measurements of sediment yield and fingerprinting the
   source of the fine sediment output, to establish a provisional sediment
   budget for a small (1.19 km(2)) agricultural catchment in southern
   Brazil. The catchment is located in an area of steep highly erodible
   basaltic terrain, which has been intensively cultivated with tobacco. An
   ongoing monitoring programme provided information on the sediment yield
   from the catchment and existing suspended sediment source fingerprinting
   investigations provided information on the main sediment sources
   contributing to the sediment load at the catchment outlet. Cs-137
   measurements have been used to estimate medium-term erosion and
   deposition rates along 17 transects across the cultivated slopes and to
   quantify sedimentation rates within valley floor sediment sinks. These
   data have been used to estimate sediment redistribution rates within the
   cultivated areas of the study catchment and sediment accumulation in the
   valley floor sinks. The information provided by the three primary data
   sources has been integrated to establish the sediment budget for the
   catchment over the past 57 years. The individual terms of the budget
   necessarily involve much uncertainty, but its closure adds confidence to
   the final result. The budget calculations indicate that the study
   catchment has a sediment delivery ratio of similar to 15\%. The
   implications of the key features of the budget for developing effective
   sediment management strategies are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{A method based on the thermodynamic equilibrium reached between the

   are chosen, and their temperature increments at the surface area under
   an alternating magnetic field (AMF) are calculated and compared through
   the concentration variation of ds-DNA modified on the surface. The
   temperature difference between the surface area of MNPs and bulk
   solution is also investigated, which can reach as high as 57.86 degrees
   C when AMF applied for 300 s. This method provides a direct path way of
   comparison hyperthermia ability of MNPs, and serves as a good reference
   to choose MNPs and decides the therapy parameters based on the unique

   Patterning was done by use of a Canon Stepper. By adjusting the angle
   between the two mask regions, the aspect ratio, which is defined as the
   length:width, of features was controlled. Features below 100 nm were
   patterned, and aspect ratios were controllably tuned between 1.1 and

Abstract = {{We present metallic nanohole arrays fabricated on suspended membranes as
   an optofluidic substrate. Millimeter-sized suspended nanohole arrays
   were fabricated using nanoimprint lithography. We demonstrate
   refractive-index-based tuning of the optical spectra using a sucrose
   solution for the optimization of SERS signal intensity, leading to a
   Raman enhancement factor of 10(7). Furthermore, compared to dead-ended
   nanohole arrays, suspended nanohole arrays capable of flow-through
   detection increased the measured SERS signal intensity by 50 times. For
   directed transport of analytes, we present a novel methodology utilizing
   surface tension to generate spontaneous flow through the nanoholes with
   flow rates of 1 mu L/min, obviating the need for external pumps or
   microfluidic interconnects. Using this method for SERS, we obtained a 50
   times higher signal as compared to diffusion-limited transport and could
   detect 100 pM 4-mercaptopyridine. The suspended nanohole substrates

Abstract = {{In this work, we generalize our previous results concerning the impact
   of material recycling and energy recovery on plant dynamics and control.
   We define a generic class of integrated process systems, in which an
   extensive quantity that obeys conservation laws is recovered from the
   process output and recycled to the process feed; the operation of the
   system is assumed to be subject to time-varying, measurable
   disturbances. We establish, in this general case, that integration is
   conducive to the emergence of a two-time-scale dynamic behavior and
   derive reduced-order models for the dynamics in each time scale.
   Subsequently, we postulate a hierarchical control framework that
   exploits these dynamics results in the design of coordinated fast and
   slow feedback/feedforward controllers and formulate a stability result

Title = {{Collision cross section calculations for polyatomic ions considering
   rotating diatomic/linear gas molecules}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 21}},
Abstract = {{Structural characterization of ions in the gas phase is facilitated by
   measurement of ion collision cross sections (CCS) using techniques such
   as ion mobility spectrometry. Further information is gained from CCS
   measurement when comparison is made between measurements and accurately
   predicted CCSs for model ion structures and the gas in which
   measurements are made. While diatomic gases, namely molecular nitrogen
   and air, are being used in CCS measurement with increasingly prevalency,
   the majority of studies in which measurements are compared to
   predictions use models in which gas molecules are spherical or
   non-rotating, which is not necessarily appropriate for diatomic gases.
   Here, we adapt a momentum transfer based CCS calculation approach to
   consider rotating, diatomic gas molecule collisions with polyatomic
   ions, and compare CCS predictions with a diatomic gas molecule to those
   made with a spherical gas molecular for model spherical ions,
   tetra-alkylammonium ions, and multiply charged polyethylene glycol ions.
   CCS calculations are performed using both specular-elastic and
   diffuse-inelastic collisions rules, which mimic negligible internal
   energy exchange and complete thermal accommodation, respectively,
   between gas molecule and ion. The influence of the long range
   ion-induced dipole potential on calculations is also examined with both
   gas molecule models. In large part we find that CCSs calculated with
   specular-elastic collision rules decrease, while they increase with
   diffuse-inelastic collision rules when using diatomic gas molecules.
   Results clearly show the structural model of both the ion and gas
   molecule, the potential energy field between ion and gas molecule, and
   finally the modeled degree of kinetic energy exchange between ion and
   gas molecule internal energy are coupled to one another in CCS
   calculations, and must be considered carefully to obtain results which
   agree with measurements. (c) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Mutant RAS oncoproteins activate signaling molecules that drive
   oncogenesis in multiple human tumors including acute myelogenous
   leukemia (AML). However, the specific functions of these pathways in AML
   are unclear, thwarting the rational application of targeted
   therapeutics. To elucidate the downstream functions of activated NRAS in
   AML, we used a murine model that harbors MII-AF9 and a
   tetracycline-repressible, activated NRAS (NRAS(G12v)). Using
   computational approaches to explore our gene-expression data sets, we
   found that NRAS(G12V) enforced the leukemia self-renewal gene-expression
   signature and was required to maintain an MLL-AF9 and Myb-dependent
   leukemia self-renewal geneexpression program. NRAS(G12v) was required
   for leukemia self-renewal independent of its effects on growth and
   survival. Analysis of the gene-expression patterns of leukemic
   subpopulations revealed that the NRAS(G12v)-mediated leukemia
   self-renewal signature is preferentially expressed in the leukemia stem
   cell enriched subpopulation. In a multiplexed analysis of RAS-dependent
   signaling, Mac-1I-0 w cells, which harbor leukemia stem cells, were
   preferentially sensitive to NRAS(G12v) withdrawal. NRAS(G12v)
   `maintained leukemia self-renewal through mTOR and MEK pathway
   activation, implicating these pathways as potential targets for cancer
   stem cell specific therapies. Together, these experimental results
   define a RAS oncogene driven function that is critical for leukemia
   maintenance and represents a novel mechanism of oncogene addiction.}},

Abstract = {{The fungal meningitis pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans is a central
   driver of mortality in HIV/AIDS. We report a genome-scale chemical
   genetic data map for this pathogen that quantifies the impact of 439
   small-molecule challenges on 1,448 gene knockouts. We identified
   chemical phenotypes for 83\% of mutants screened and at least one
   genetic response for each compound. C. neoformans chemical-genetic
   responses are largely distinct from orthologous published profiles of
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae, demonstrating the importance of
   pathogen-centered studies. We used the chemical-genetic matrix to
   predict novel pathogenicity genes, infer compound mode of action, and to
   develop an algorithm, O2M, that predicts antifungal synergies. These
   predictions were experimentally validated, thereby identifying virulence
   genes, a molecule that triggers G2/M arrest and inhibits the Cdc25
   phosphatase, and many compounds that synergize with the antifungal drug
   fluconazole. Our work establishes a chemical-genetic foundation for
   approaching an infection responsible for greater than one-third of
   AIDS-related deaths.}},

Abstract = {{New coal reaction technology called ReEngineered Feedstock (ReEF),
   consisting of post-recycled paper and plastics, was evaluated for
   combustion emissions control when cofiring with pulverized coal.
   Experiments were conducted with four types of ReEF in a 2 in. diameter
   laboratory-scale fluidized bed combustor system heated to 1200, 1400,
   and 1600 degrees C. Flue gas emission was continuously monitored with an
   online infrared multigas analyzer and mass spectrometer. The results
   indicate that co-firing ReEF with coal provides SO2 emission reduction
   in flue gas up to 85\% and moderate decrease in NO emissions, as well as
   higher carbon conversion than pure coal combustion. ReEF, slag and fly
   ash solids were were analyzed by X-ray diffraction; identification of
   sulfates in the product ash conclusively supports the mechanism of in
   situ sulfur capture.}},

Abstract = {{Long-term storage of desiccated nucleated mammalian cells at ambient
   temperature may be accomplished in a stable glassy state, which can be
   achieved by removal of water from the biological sample in the presence
   of glass-forming agents including trehalose. The stability of the glass
   may be compromised due to a nonuniform distribution of residual water
   and trehalose within and around the desiccated cells. Thus,
   quantification of water and trehalose contents at the single-cell level
   is critical for predicting the glass formation and stability for dry
   storage. Using Raman microspectroscopy, we estimated the trehalose and
   residual water contents in the microenvironment of spin-dried cells.
   Individual cells with or without intracellular trehalose were embedded
   in a solid thin layer of extracellular trehalose after spin-drying. We
   found strong evidence suggesting that the residual water was bound at a
   2:1 water/trehalose molar ratio in both the extracellular and
   intracellular milieus. Other than the water associated with trehalose,
   we did not find any more residual water in the spin-dried sample, intra-
   or extracellularly. The extracellular trehalose film exhibited
   characteristics of an amorphous state with a glass transition
   temperature of similar to 22 degrees C. The intracellular milieu also
   dried to levels suitable for glass formation at room temperature. These
   findings demonstrate a method for quantification of water and trehalose
   in desiccated specimens using confocal Raman microspectroscopy. This
   approach has broad use in desiccation studies to carefully investigate
   the relationship of water and trehalose content and distribution with
   the tolerance to drying in mammalian cells.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{NOV 18}},
Abstract = {{Spin crossover of iron is of central importance in solid Earth
   geophysics. It impacts all physical properties of minerals that
   altogether constitute similar to 95 vol\% of the Earth's lower mantle:
   ferropericlase {[}(Mg,Fe)O] and Fe-bearing magnesium silicate (MgSiO3)
   perovskite. Despite great strides made in the past decade, the existence
   of an intermediate-spin (IS) state in ferrous iron (Fe2+) (with total
   electron spin S = 1) and its possible role in the pressure-induced spin
   crossover in these lower-mantle minerals still remain controversial.
   Using density functional theory + self-consistent Hubbard U (DFT + U-sc)
   calculations, we investigate all possible types of IS states of Fe2+ in
   (Mg,Fe)O and (Mg,Fe)SiO3 perovskite. Among the possible IS states in
   these minerals, the most probable IS state has an electronic
   configuration that significantly reduces the electron overlap and the
   iron nuclear quadrupole splitting (QS). These most probable IS states,
   however, are still energetically disfavored, and their QSs are
   inconsistent with Mossbauer spectra. We therefore conclude that IS Fe2+
   is highly unlikely in the Earth's lower mantle.}},

Title = {{Gravity-driven instability of a thin liquid film underneath a soft solid}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 17}},
Abstract = {{The gravity-driven instability of a thin liquid film located underneath
   a soft solid material is considered. The equations and boundary
   conditions governing the solid deformation are systematically converted
   from a Lagrangian representation to an Eulerian representation, which is
   the natural framework for describing the liquid motion. This systematic
   conversion reveals that the continuity-of-velocity boundary condition at
   the liquid-solid interface is more complicated than has previously been
   assumed, even in the small-strain limit. We then make clear the
   conditions under which the commonly used simplified version of this
   boundary condition is valid. The small-strain approximation, lubrication
   theory, and linear stability analysis are applied to derive an
   expression for the growth rate of small-amplitude perturbations.
   Asymptotic analysis reveals that the coupling between the liquid and
   solid manifests itself as a lower effective liquid-air interfacial
   tension that leads to larger instability growth rates. Although this
   suggests that it is more difficult to maintain a stable liquid coating
   underneath a soft solid, the effect is expected to be weak for cases of
   practical interest.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of causative variants in familial breast cancer remain
   unknown. Of the known risk variants, most are tumor cell autonomous, and
   little attention has been paid yet to germline variants that may affect
   the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we developed a system called
   the Consomic Xenograft Model (CXM) to map germline variants that affect
   only the tumor microenvironment. In CXM, human breast cancer cells are
   orthotopically implanted into immunodeficient consomic strains and tumor
   metrics are quantified (e.g., growth, vasculogenesis, and metastasis).
   Because the strain backgrounds vary, whereas the malignant tumor cells
   do not, any observed changes in tumor progression are due to genetic
   differences in the nonmalignant microenvironment. Using CXM, we defined
   genetic variants on rat chromosome 3 that reduced relative tumor growth
   and hematogenous metastasis in the SS. BN3(IL2R gamma) consomic model
   compared with the SSIL2R gamma parental strain. Paradoxically, these
   effects occurred despite an increase in the density of tumor-associated
   blood vessels. In contrast, lymphatic vasculature and lymphogenous
   metastasis were unaffected by the SS. BN3(IL2R gamma) background.
   Through comparative mapping and whole-genome sequence analysis, we
   narrowed candidate variants on rat chromosome 3 to six genes with a
   priority for future analysis. Collectively, our results establish the
   utility of CXM to localize genetic variants affecting the tumor
   microenvironment that underlie differences in breast cancer risk. (C)

Abstract = {{A new approach is used to detect atmospheric teleconnections without
   being bound by orthogonality (such as empirical orthogonal functions).
   This method employs negative correlations in a global dataset to detect
   potential teleconnections. One teleconnection occurs between the Tasman
   Sea and the Southern Ocean. It is related to El Nino-Southern
   Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), and the southern
   annular mode (SAM). This teleconnection is significantly correlated with
   SAM during austral summer, fall, and winter, with IOD during spring, and
   with ENSO in summer. It can thus be described as a hybrid between these
   modes. Given previously found relationships between IOD and ENSO, and
   IOD's proximity to the teleconnection centers, correlations to IOD are
   generally stronger than to ENSO.Increasing pressure over the Tasman Sea
   leads to higher (lower) surface temperature over eastern Australia (the
   southwestern Pacific) in all seasons and is related to reduced surface
   temperature over Wilkes Land and Adelie Land in Antarctica during fall
   and winter. Precipitation responses are generally negative over New
   Zealand. For one standard deviation of the teleconnection index,
   precipitation anomalies are positive over Australia in fall, negative
   over southern Australia in winter and spring, and negative over eastern
   Australia in summer. When doubling the threshold, the size of the
   anomalous high-pressure center increases and annual precipitation
   anomalies are negative over southeastern Australia and northern New
   Zealand. Eliassen-Palm fluxes quantify the seasonal dependence of SAM,
   ENSO, and IOD influences. Analysis of the dynamical interactions between
   these teleconnection patterns can improve prediction of seasonal
   temperature and precipitation patterns in Australia and New Zealand.}},

Abstract = {{Nanometric particles of a model hydrophobic substance curcumin were
   prepared by a novel method, namely, flash nanoprecipitation from a
   coarse oil-in-water emulsion. The method employs turbulent co-mixing of
   water with curcumin-loaded emulsion using manually-operated confined
   impingement jets mixer. A clear and stable dispersion of nanoparticles
   was formed in this process, and could be converted to dry, easily
   water-dispersible powder by spray drying. The mean size of the particles
   was about 40 nm by DLS, confirmed by Cryo-TEM. The obtained particles
   contained 20.4 wt\% curcumin, X-ray analysis showed it was amorphous.
   The significant advantages of the studied process are its feasibility,
   speed and low cost. It does not require any special high-energy input
   equipment to reduce the droplet size of the initial emulsion as required
   by the vast majority of other methods, and relies on rapid turbulent
   mixing and on flow-induced shear stress formed in the simple,
   manually-operated mixer. Control experiments clearly indicate that
   employing emulsion, instead of a plain solution and flash
   nanoprecipitation instead of a simple antisolvent precipitation are
   advantageous in terms of particle size and stability. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We propose a new computational approach for simulating the coupled
   interaction between air-water flows and arbitrarily complex floating
   rigid bodies. The numerical method integrates the fluid-structure
   interaction (FSI) curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method of
   Borazjani et al. (2008) {[}21] with a level set approach for simulating
   free surface flows in arbitrarily complex domains. We show that when
   applying the CURVIB method to simulate two-phase flow FSI problems the
   approach used to calculate the force imparted on the body is critical
   for determining the overall accuracy of the method. We develop and
   demonstrate the accuracy of a new approach for calculating the force,
   namely the pressure projection boundary condition (PPBC), which is based
   on projecting the pressure on the surface of the body using the momentum
   equation along the local normal to the body direction. Extensive
   numerical tests show that the new approach greatly improves the ability
   of the method to correctly predict the dynamics of the floating
   structure motion. To demonstrate the predictive capabilities of the
   method and its ability to simulate non-linear free surface phenomena,
   such as breaking waves, we apply it to various two-and three-dimensional
   problems involving complex rigid bodies interacting with a free surface
   both with prescribed body motion and coupled FSI. We show that for all
   cases the proposed method yields results in very good accuracy with
   benchmark numerical data and available experiments. The simulations also
   reveal the onset of dynamically rich, energetic coherent structures in
   the air phase induced by the waves generated as the rigid body interacts
   with the free surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Heterogeneous reactions benefit from active materials with accessible
   pores and high surface areas. Such materials can be synthesized, for
   example, by templating methods. Particularly high surface areas are
   obtained in nanoporous solids. However, the solid walls surrounding
   nanopores also have typical dimensions in the nanometer range, and these
   walls are prone to sintering at high temperatures, reducing the active
   surface area. Here we demonstrate wood templating as an approach that
   balances accessible porosity with higher thermal stability, using cerium
   oxide as a representative active material in a high-temperature process:
   thermochemical CO production. Wood-templated CeO2 (WT CeO2) was
   synthesized via the Pechini method and annealed at 12001500 degrees C,
   temperatures suitable for the thermochemical reduction of CeO2. The pore
   structure consists of interconnected channels with pores tens of
   micrometers in diameter and micrometer-thick walls. The WT CeO2
   maintained its interconnected pore structure with surface areas of
   similar to 0.1 m(2) g(-1) at temperatures up to 1400 degrees C, despite
   significant grain growth. The cycling performance of the annealed WT
   CeO2 was tested by conducting 21 cycles in an infrared imaging furnace.
   WT CeO2 samples were reduced at temperatures from 1200 to 1500 degrees C
   and reoxidized with CO2 at 800 degrees C. The presintered WT CeO2
   samples retained their structure after cycling. With a reduction
   temperature of 1400 degrees C, the WT CeO2 achieved CO production rates
   6 times higher than nonporous CeO2 compared at the same nonstoichiometry
   d (for CeO2-delta). CO production rates are comparable to those obtained
   with electrospun Zr-doped CeO2 fibers under similar conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Printing electrically functional liquid inks is a promising approach for
   achieving low-cost, large-area, additive manufacturing of flexible
   electronic circuits. To print thin-film transistors, a basic building
   block of thin-film electronics, it is important to have several options
   for printable electrode materials that exhibit high conductivity, high
   stability, and low-cost. Here we report completely aerosol jet printed
   (AJP) p- and n-type electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) using a variety
   of different electrode materials including highly conductive metal
   nanopartides (Ag), conducting polymers (polystyrene-sulfonate doped
   poly(3,4-ethylendedioxythiophene, PEDOT:PSS), transparent carbon-based
   materials (reduced graphene oxide). Using these source-drain electrode
   materials and a PEDOT:PSS/ion gel gate stack, we demonstrated
   all-printed p- and n-type EGTs in combination with poly(3-hexythiophene)
   and ZnO semiconductors. All transistor components (including electrodes,
   semiconductors, and gate insulators) were printed by AJP. Both kinds of
   devices showed typical p- and n-type transistor characteristics, and
   exhibited both low-threshold voltages (<2 V) and high hole and electron
   mobilities. Our assessment suggests Ag electrodes may be the best option
   in terms of overall performance for both types of EGTs.}},

Abstract = {{A facile fabrication route to pattern high-capacitance electrolyte thin
   films in electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) was demonstrated using a
   photoinitiated cross-linkable ABA-triblock copolymer ion gel. The azide
   groups of poly(styrene-r-vinylbenzylazide) (PS-N-3) end-blocks can be
   chemically cross-linked via UV irradiation (lambda = 254 nm) in the
   self-assembly of poly{[}(styrene-r-vinylbenzylazide)-b-ethylene
   oxide-b-(styrene-r-vinylbenzylazide)] (SOS-N-3) triblock copolymer in
   the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ({[}EMI]-{[}TFSI]). Impedance
   spectroscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that ion
   transport and microstructure of the ion gel are not affected by UV
   cross-linking. Using a photoinduced cross-linking strategy,
   photopatterning of ion gels through a patterned mask was achieved.
   Employing a photopatterned ion gel as the high-capacitance gate
   insulator in thin film transistors (TFTs), arrays of TFTs exhibited
   uniform and high device performance. Specifically, both p-type
   (poly(3-hexylthiophene)) (P3HT) and n-type (ZnO) transistors displayed
   high carrier mobility (hole mobility of similar to 1.4 cm(2)/ (V s) and
   electron mobility of similar to 0.7 cm(2)/ (V s) and ON/OFF current
   ratio (similar to 10(5)) at supply voltages below 2 V. This study
   suggests that photopatterning is a promising candidate to conveniently
   incorporate high-capacitance ion gels into TFTs in the fabrication of
   printed electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, an approach was introduced for incorporating renewable biomass
   into existing commercial acrylic thermoplastic pressure-sensitive
   adhesive (PSA) polymers in the form of acrylated macromonomers (MM).
   This was achieved without sacrificing adhesive performance. Here a study
   is reviewed on the influence of N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide capped
   poly(l-lactide-co-e-caprolactone) MM composition on the properties of
   acrylic hot-melt adhesive. A series of MMs containing a broad range of
   lactic acid and caprolactone repeat units were synthesized using
   catalyzed ring-opening polymerization. These MMs were substituted for
   2-ethylhexyl acrylate in a commercial formulation to generate adhesive
   polymers via solution polymerization. Results indicate that the
   properties and performance of adhesive polymers are strongly dependent
   on the lactide content in MMs. In general, increasing lactide relative
   to caprolactone increases polymer hardness enhancing cohesive strength,
   while reducing it softens the polymer. Optimal adhesion is found to
   require a balance between these tendencies, as indicated by the
   existence of a clear maximum in both tack and peel data. The results
   demonstrate that a broad range of properties is achievable through
   changes in composition.}},

Abstract = {{Replacing sodium with cesium as the counterion for dodecyl sulfate in
   aqueous solution results in stronger complexation and charge shielding,
   which should lead to larger micelles and ultimately to a cylindrical
   structure (cf. spheres for sodium dodecyl sulfate), but small angle
   X-ray scattering (SAXS) and small angle neutron scattering patterns
   previously have been interpreted with ellipsoidal micelle models. We
   directly image CsDS micelles via cryo-transmission electron microscopy
   and report large core-shell spherical micelles at low concentrations (<=
   2 wt \%) and cylindrical micelles at higher concentrations (5.0 and 8.1
   wt \%). These structures are shown to be consistent with SAXS patterns
   modeled using established form factors. These findings highlight the
   importance of combining real and reciprocal space imaging techniques in
   the characterization of self-assembled soft materials.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial adhesion between polymer and nanofiller plays an
   important role in affecting the properties of nanocomposites. The
   detailed relationship between interfacial adhesion and bulk properties,
   however, is unclear. In this work, we developed an atomic force
   microscopy (AFM)-based abrasive scanning methodology, as applied to
   model laminate systems, to probe the strength of interfacial adhesion
   relevant to poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)/graphene or clay
   nanocomposites. Graphite and mica substrates covered with similar to 2
   nm thick PET films were abrasively sheared by an AFM tip as a model
   measurement of interfacial strength between matrix PET and dispersed
   graphene and clay, respectively. During several abrasive raster-scan
   cycles, PET was shear-displaced from the scanned region. At temperatures
   below the PET glass transition, PET on graphite exhibited abrupt
   delamination (i.e., full adhesive failure), whereas PET on mica did not;
   rather, it exhibited a degree of cohesive failure within the
   shear-displaced layer. Moreover, 100-fold higher force scanning
   procedures were required to abrade through an ultimate ``precursor{''}
   layer of PET only similar to 0.2-0.5 nm thick, which must be largely
   disentangled from the matrix polymer. Thus, the adhesive interface of
   relevance to the strength of clay-filler nanocomposites is between
   matrix polymer and strongly bound polymer. At 90 degrees C, above the
   bulk PET glass transition temperature, the PET film exhibited cohesive
   failure on both graphite and mica. Our results suggest that there is
   little difference in the strength of the relevant interfacial adhesion
   in the two nanocomposites within the rubbery dynamic regime. Further,
   the bulk mechanical properties of melt mixed PET/graphene and PET/clay
   nanocomposites were evaluated by dynamic mechanical analysis. The glassy
   dynamic storage modulus of the PET/clay nanocomposite was higher than
   that of PET/graphene, correlating with the differences in interfacial
   adhesion probed by AFM.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of antibiotics is one of the most important advances in

   therapies become obsolete because of bacterial resistance. Mathematical
   models and simulations guide the development of complex technologies,

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel fiber-based magnetooptic (MO) latching circuit
   using a bismuth-substituted yttrium iron garnet (Bi:YIG) is presented.
   Experimentation shows that nearly 90 degrees of rotation of the state of
   polarization of incident light occurs between material latching states
   upon application of an external magnetic field greater than 500 G. This
   amount of rotation is enough to cause sufficient routing at the output
   of an optical interferometer of Sagnac configuration, which is presented
   in this paper. Due to the high coercivity of the Bi:YIG, the material
   remains in its magnetized state for very long periods of time and is
   thus latched. Reversing the applied magnetic field changes the state of
   the material, unlatching it. This capability has great importance for
   nonreciprocal all-optical devices requiring low power operation. In
   addition, having such control of the state of the nonreciprocal elements
   can allow for a wider diversification of small-scale and large-scale
   optical network design. A discussion of the experimental setup, the
   resulting measurement data, and its implication for future low power
   applications is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic nanowires with low resistivity were grown inside insulating
   aluminum oxide matrices that contained very uniform columnar nanopores
   (10.6+/1.7 nm diameters). These nanopores can be made with large-scale
   order (cm(2)), which is desirable in applications such as hard drive
   read sensors and random access memories. The nanowires are grown by
   electrochemical deposition directly inside the alumina to avoid sidewall
   damage compared to nanostructures that are defined from films by
   lithographical patterning and etching. Specifically, trilayers of
   {[}Co(15 nm)/Cu(5 nm)/Co(10 nm)] were synthesized and measured to have
   30 Omega resistance and 19\% magnetoresistance. These parameters are
   desirable for read head sensors, especially because the nanowires
   described here have 1: 1 aspect ratios, and 10x smaller areas and 100x
   lower resistances than conventional read sensors based on
   lithographically produced magnetic tunnel junctions. A new nanostamping
   technique is introduced, in which linear stamps with ordered cm(2) areas
   are imprinted onto aluminum precursors to produce ordered nanoporous
   aluminum oxide upon anodization. These stamps are substantially
   less-time consuming and cheaper to make than dot type stamps, and the
   order enables closely spaced arrays of CPP-GMR sensors for one-pass 2-D
   recording and cross recording. Importantly, the GMR sensors are grown
   directly into aluminum oxide with 20 nm separation. Therefore, a
   relatively large pattern (30 x 100 nm) can be used to produce three 10
   nm-diameter GMR sensors without roughening or redeposition on sidewalls.
   The sensors are also already embedded in alumina for subsequent device
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{Micromagnetic writing on 8 nm grains and readback with various readers
   have been studied. For a conventional writer recording a pseudorandom
   binary sequence with 2 Tb/in(2) channel bit density, user densities of
   1.52 and 1.09 Tb/in(2) could be achieved with a rotated single sense
   head (RSH) and a normally oriented single head (NSH), respectively,
   using 2 nm sampling period, a minimum mean squared error equalizer, and
   a Viterbi detector. Simulation indicated that an RSH with multiple scans
   and 2-D equalization provided better resistance to a skew angle of 15
   degrees than an NSH. An optimized shingled writer was proposed;
   simulation indicated that an RSH and rotated head array could reach a
   user areal density of 3.76 and 4.52 Tb/in2 for two grains per channel
   bit, which was close to the predicted maximum user areal density (4.66
   Tb/in(2)) for this grain size obtained with an ideal writer and reader.}},

Title = {{A national satellite-based land-use regression model for air pollution
   exposure assessment in Australia}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Land-use regression (LUR) is a technique that can improve the accuracy
   of air pollution exposure assessment in epidemiological studies. Most
   LUR models are developed for single cities, which places limitations on
   their applicability to other locations. We sought to develop a model to
   predict nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations with national coverage of
   Australia by using satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 columns
   combined with other predictor variables. We used a generalised
   estimating equation (GEE) model to predict annual and monthly average
   ambient NO2 concentrations measured by a national monitoring network
   from 2006 through 2011. The best annual model explained 81\% of spatial
   variation in NO2 (absolute RMS error = 1.4 ppb), while the best monthly
   model explained 76\% (absolute RMS error = 1.9 ppb). We applied our
   models to predict NO2 concentrations at the similar to 350,000 census
   mesh blocks across the country (a mesh block is the smallest spatial
   unit in the Australian census). National population-weighted average
   concentrations ranged from 7.3 ppb (2006) to 6.3 ppb (2011). We found
   that a simple approach using tropospheric NO2 column data yielded models
   with slightly better predictive ability than those produced using a more
   involved approach that required simulation of surface-to-column ratios.
   The models were capable of capturing within-urban variability in NO2,
   and offer the ability to estimate ambient NO2 concentrations at monthly
   and annual time scales across Australia from 2006-2011. We are making
   our model predictions freely available for research. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to better understand changes in the
   hardwood lumber supply chain from the perspective of lumber producers
   and distributors and to assess the degree of judgmental convergence
   between suppliers and buyers of hardwood lumber. Results from two
   nationwide surveys conducted in 2008 and 2009 were used for the
   analysis. Findings confirmed a decline in demand for red oak and an
   increase in species diversity in the market, although a majority of
   sales were dominated by five species. Results also showed an increasing
   importance of markets for lower grades of lumber, such as pallets,
   containers, and railroad ties, and a decline in demand for higher-value
   products such as furniture and kitchen cabinets. The importance of the
   lumber distributor role in the hardwood supply chain also has increased.
   Both sawmills and suppliers have increased their offerings of customized
   products and services in response to market demand. The customer base is
   changing, with smaller, more customized orders being sold to smaller
   businesses. Some of the trends and changes identified are structural and
   long-running in nature and are not expected to change in the short term.}},

Journal = {{COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{23-31}},

Abstract = {{Hyperspectral imagery divides spectrum into many bands with. very narrow
   bandwidth. It is more capable to detect or classify objects, where
   visible information is not sufficient for the task. However,
   hyperspectral image contains a large amount of redundant information,
   which eliminates its discriminability. Band selection is used to both
   reduce the dimensionality of hyperspectral images and save useful bands
   for further application. This study explores the feasibility of
   hyperspectral imaging for the task of classifying blueberry fruit growth
   stages and background. Three information theory based band selection
   methods using Kullback-Leibler divergence: pair-wise class
   discriminability, hierarchical dimensionality reduction and
   non-Gaussianity measures were applied. Three classifiers, K-nearest
   neighbor, support vector machine and AdaBoost were used to test the
   performance of the selected bands by the three methods. The selected
   bands achieved classification accuracies of 88\% and higher. Therefore,
   the band selection methods are very useful in reducing the volume of the
   hyperspectral data, and constructing a multispectral imaging system for
   detecting blueberry fruit maturity stages. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of determining the optimal schedules for a given
   sequence of jobs on a single processor. The objective is to minimize the
   expected total cost incurred by job waiting and processor idling, where
   the job processing times are random variables. It is known in the prior
   literature that if the processing times are integers and the costs are
   linear functions satisfying a mild condition, then the problem can be
   solved in a polynomial number of expected cost evaluations. In this
   work, we extend the result to piecewise linear cost functions, which
   include many useful objective functions in practice. Our analysis
   explores the (hidden) dual network flow structure of the appointment
   scheduling problem and thus greatly simplifies that of prior work. We
   also find the number of samples needed to compute a near optimal
   solution when only some independent samples of processing times are
   known.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Light-sound interactions have long been exploited in various
   acousto-optic devices based on bulk crystalline materials.
   Conventionally, these devices operate in megahertz frequency range where
   the acoustic wavelength is much longer than the optical wavelength and a
   long interaction length is required to attain significant coupling. With
   nanoscale transducers, acoustic waves with sub-optical wavelengths can
   now be excited to induce strong acousto-optic coupling in nanophotonic
   devices. Here we demonstrate microwave frequency surface acoustic wave
   transducers co-integrated with nanophotonic resonators on piezoelectric
   aluminum nitride substrates. Acousto-optic modulation of the resonance
   modes at above 10 GHz with the acoustic wavelength significantly below
   the optical wavelength is achieved. The phase and modal matching
   conditions in this scheme are investigated for efficient modulation. The
   new acousto-optic platform can lead to novel optical devices based on
   nonlinear Brillouin processes and provides a direct, wideband link
   between optical and microwave photons for microwave photonics and
   quantum optomechanics.}},

Abstract = {{Because of their ability to strongly localize and enhance optical
   fields, plasmonic nanostructures have the potential to dramatically
   amplify the inherent nonlinear response of materials. We illustrate the
   impact of this plasmonic interaction by investigating the third-harmonic
   generation (THG) from a system of film-coupled nanostripes operating at
   1500 nm. Both the film and the stripes are gold, separated by a
   nanoscale layer of aluminum oxide (Al2O3) grown using atomic layer
   deposition. This nanoscale junction, with an ultrasmooth interface,
   forms a waveguide cavity resonator with a large and controllable
   electric field enhancement, whose plasmon resonance can be tuned
   independently by changing the stripe width. We study experimentally the
   dependence of THG on the field enhancement by varying the gap size
   between the stripe and the metal film while simultaneously maintaining a
   fixed plasmon resonance. The experiments are supported with numerical
   simulations in which nonlinear contributions of the dielectric spacer
   layer and the metal are considered. Enhancements of the THG of nearly 5
   orders of magnitude with respect to a bare metal film are measured
   experimentally for the smallest gap sizes, with a trend similar to that
   found in the numerical simulations.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A dynamic end cap methodology is proposed to account for spurious
   contributions to the far-field sound within the context of the
   Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy. The quadrupole
   source terms are correlated over multiple planes to obtain a convection
   velocity which is then used to determine a corrective convective flux at
   the FW-H porous surface. The proposed approach is first demonstrated for
   a convecting potential vortex. It is then evaluated by computing the
   sound emitted by flow over circular cylinders at Reynolds number of 150,
   10 000, and 89 000, respectively. The low Re cylinder is used to
   validate against direct numerical simulation (DNS) and demonstrate
   insensitivity to end plane location and spacing, the effect of dynamic
   convection velocity and to compare to commonly used end cap corrections.
   The Re 100 00 cylinder is used to validate at turbulent Reynolds numbers
   against other simulations. Finally the Re 89 000 simulations are used to
   compare to experiment. The proposed approach demonstrates better
   performance than other commonly used approaches with the added benefit
   of computational efficiency and the ability to query independent
   volumes. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Natural Polymorphisms in Human APOBEC3H and HIV-1 Vif Combine in Primary

Abstract = {{The Vif protein of HIV-1 allows virus replication by degrading several
   members of the host-encoded APOBEC3 family of DNA cytosine deaminases.
   Polymorphisms in both host APOBEC3 genes and the viral vif gene have the
   potential to impact the extent of virus replication among individuals.
   The most genetically diverse of the seven human APOBEC3 genes is
   APOBEC3H with seven known haplotypes. Overexpression studies have shown
   that a subset of these variants express stable and active proteins,
   whereas the others encode proteins with a short half-life and little, if
   any, antiviral activity. We demonstrate that these stable/unstable
   phenotypes are an intrinsic property of endogenous APOBEC3H proteins in
   primary CD4+ T lymphocytes and confer differential resistance to HIV-1
   infection in a manner that depends on natural variation in the Vif
   protein of the infecting virus. HIV-1 with a Vif protein hypo-functional
   for APOBEC3H degradation, yet fully able to counteract APOBEC3D,
   APOBEC3F, and APOBEC3G, was susceptible to restriction and hypermutation
   in stable APOBEC3H expressing lymphocytes, but not in unstable APOBEC3H
   expressing lymphocytes. In contrast, HIV-1 with hyper-functional Vif
   counteracted stable APOBEC3H proteins as well as all other endogenous
   APOBEC3s and replicated to high levels. We also found that APOBEC3H
   protein levels are induced over 10-fold by infection. Finally, we found
   that the global distribution of stable/unstable APOBEC3H haplotypes
   correlates with the distribution a critical hyper/hypo-functional Vif
   amino acid residue. These data combine to strongly suggest that stable
   APOBEC3H haplotypes present as in vivo barriers to HIV-1 replication,
   that Vif is capable of adapting to these restrictive pressures, and that
   an evolutionary equilibrium has yet to be reached.}},

Abstract = {{The cyclic esteracetal 2-methyl-1,3-dioxane-4-one (MDO) was polymerized
   in bulk using diethyl zinc as the catalyst and benzyl alcohol as the
   initiator to yield either the corresponding polyesteracetal (PMDO) or
   the aliphatic polyester poly(3-hydroxypropionic acid) (PHPA) at low and
   high catalyst concentrations, respectively. Spectral analysis gave
   evidence for distinct propagating species in the two catalyst
   concentration regimes. At low zinc concentrations ring opening by attack
   of the initiating species at the acetal functionality, yielding a zinc
   carboxylate, followed by propagation to yield pure PMDO was implicated
   At high zinc concentrations we propose that ring opening via attack at
   the ester functionality produced a labile zinc hemiacetal, which rapidly
   and irreversibly expelled acetaldehyde to form a propagating zinc
   alkoxide and ultimately pure PHPA. Initial rate studies indicated that
   the rate of PHPA formation had a second-order dependence on zinc
   concentration; in contrast, the rate of PMDO formation was first order
   in zinc concentration. High molar mass PMDO exhibited only a glass
   transition temperature (T-g) approximate to -30 degrees C, whereas high
   molar mass PHPA had a T-g approximate to -30 degrees C and a melting
   temperature (T-m) approximate to 77 degrees C. When PHPA and PMDO were
   subjected to neutral or slightly acidic environments, PMDO exhibited
   expedited degradation as compared with PHPA.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that addition of block copolymers to immiscible polymer
   blends may result in finer and more stable microstructures by reducing
   the driving force for coarsening, namely, the interfacial tension. This
   compatibilization is also reflected in the rheological behavior of the
   blends. We present an experimental study on the morphology and rheology
   of model blends composed of fluorescently labeled polystyrene and
   styrene-ran-acrylonitrile copolymer compatibilized with a
   polystyrene-b-polymethyl methacrylate diblock copolymer (BC). Three
   different weight ratios (wt/wt) are studied: 20/80, 35/65, and 50/50,
   with the following morphologies: Droplet/matrix, metastable
   cocontinuous, and abiding cocontinuous, respectively. It is found that
   regardless the type of initial morphology, the addition of BC reduces
   the characteristic size and increases the elastic modulus in the
   terminal regime, where the relaxation of the interface is probed. The
   relaxation spectra in the terminal zone are greatly affected by the
   presence of BC, which reflects the strong dependence of the viscoelastic
   behavior on the local microstructure (shape and area) of the interface.
   Furthermore, the addition of BC reduces the rate of coarsening, which is
   characterized by the time evolution of both the elastic modulus and the
   specific interfacial area. These effects are more pronounced when the
   molecular weight or concentration of the BC is higher. Finally, two
   regimes of coarsening in the symmetric (50/50) blends were identified
   and characterized by two different power laws. (C) 2014 The Society of
   Rheology.}},

Abstract = {{Copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS) thin films were synthesized by ex situ
   sulfidation of Cu-Zn-Sn metal alloy precursor films cosputtered from Cu,
   Cu-Zn, and Cu-Sn targets onto five different substrate materials: single
   crystal quartz, fused quartz, sapphire, Pyrex, and soda lime glass
   (SLG). Cosputtered precursor films, which were found to consist of Cu,
   Zn, and Sn metals and Cu6.26Sn5 ordered alloys, were sulfidized between
   100 and 600 degrees C, corresponding to an S pressure range of 0.051-36
   Torr. While CZTS forms at temperatures as low as 300 degrees C on all
   substrates, the film's phase composition is dominated by binary metal
   sulfides between 300 and 400 degrees C. Significant phase composition
   variations among films synthesized on different substrates begin to
   emerge at 400 degrees C. Films grown on SLG are nearly phase pure CZTS
   by 500 degrees C, with small amounts of ZnS. In contrast, films
   deposited on all other substrates persistently contain significant
   amounts of impurity phases such as SnS2 and Cu4Sn7S16 until the
   sulfidation temperature is increased to 600 degrees C. Significant grain
   growth also begins between 500 and 600 degrees C. At 600 degrees C, CZTS
   films synthesized on SLG were found to have significantly larger grains
   than films grown on any of the other substrates. These results
   demonstrate that CZTS phase purity and grain size, properties that may
   affect solar cell performance, are affected by impurity diffusion from
   the SLG substrate, further emphasizing the importance of selecting
   appropriate substrates. (C) 2014 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Mechanical motion of photonic devices driven by optical forces provides
   a profound means of coupling between optical fields. The current focus
   of these optomechanical effects has been on cavity optomechanics systems
   in which co-localized optical and mechanical modes interact strongly to
   enable wave mixing between photons and phonons, and backaction cooling
   of mechanical modes. Alternatively, extended mechanical modes can also
   induce strong non-local effects on propagating optical fields or
   multiple localized optical modes at distances. Here, we demonstrate a
   multicavity optomechanical device in which torsional optomechanical
   motion can shuttle photons between two photonic crystal nanocavities.
   The resonance frequencies of the two cavities, one on each side of this
   `photon see-saw', are modulated antisymmetrically by the device's
   rotation. Pumping photons into one cavity excites optomechanical
   self-oscillation, which strongly modulates the inter-cavity coupling and
   shuttles photons to the other empty cavity during every oscillation
   cycle in a well-regulated fashion.}},

Abstract = {{Single-poly embedded flash (eFlash) memory is a unique category of
   embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) that can be built in a generic logic
   technology. Several single-poly eFlash cells have been proposed for
   cost-effective moderate density eNVM applications. However, the optimal
   cell configuration of single-poly eFlash is still under debate. In this
   paper, we compared various single-poly eFlash memory structures in terms
   of disturbance, program/erase speed, endurance, and retention
   characteristic based on simulated and experimental data from two eFlash
   test chips fabricated in a generic 65-nm logic process using standard
   2.5 V I/O transistors with 5-nm tunnel oxide. We conclude that a 5T
   eFlash cell structure combining a pMOS coupling device, an NCAP
   tunneling device, and an nMOS read/program device with two additional
   pass transistors to support self-boosting is the most attractive option
   for logic-compatible eNVMs.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{319}},
Pages = {{44-53}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Vapor-phase hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of anisole over Mo2C catalysts at
   low temperatures (420-520 K) and ambient pressure showed (1) remarkable
   selectivity for C-O bond cleavage, giving benzene selectivity >90\%
   among C-6(+) products, (2) high hydrogen efficiency for the HDO reaction
   as indicated by low cyclohexane selectivity (<9\%), and (3) good
   stability over similar to 50 h. Methane selectivity increased at the
   expense of methanol selectivity as anisole conversion increased,
   suggesting that the phenolic C-O bond was cleaved preferentially. The
   concurrent near half-/zero-order dependence of benzene synthesis rates
   on H-2/anisole pressure, and the preferential inhibition of benzene
   synthesis rates upon introduction of CO relative to isotopic HD exchange
   suggest that catalytic sites for H-2 activation are distinct from those
   required for the activation of anisole. The involvement of metallic
   sites on Mo2C catalysts for this reaction was demonstrated by the nearly
   invariant benzene synthesis rate per CO chemisorption site. (C) 2014

   triblock polymers. These alpha,omega hydroxy-telechelic polymers were
   subsequently coupled to prepare linear alternating (LDL)(n) multiblock
   polymers. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small-angle X-ray
   scattering (SAXS) indicated microphase separation into two domains in
   both the triblock and multiblock architectures. The temperature
   dependent Flory-Huggins interaction parameter for this system chi(T) =
   69.1/T - 0.072, was estimated from the experimentally determined
   order-disorder transition temperature (T-ODT) values of four symmetric
   LDL triblock polymers. Uniaxial extension tests revealed a dramatic
   dependence of the room-temperature mechanical properties on overall
   molar mass. Additionally, coupling low molar mass LDL triblocks to
   prepare (LDL)(n) multiblocks led to substantial increases in the
   ultimate elongation and tensile stress at break. Compared to high molar
   mass triblocks with inaccessible T-ODT values, (LDL)(n) multiblocks of
   similar composition and molar mass were found to disorder at much lower
   temperatures (T-ODT < 150 degrees C). Because of this, it was possible
   to process (LDL)(n) using injection molding. The simple synthetic
   procedure and melt processability of the (LDL)(n) multiblock polymers
   make these multiblocks attractive as renewable thermoplastic elastomers
   (TPEs).}},

Abstract = {{In this study, fast microwave-assisted catalytic pyrolysis of sewage
   sludge was investigated for bio-oil production, with HZSM-5 as the
   catalyst. Pyrolysis temperature and catalyst to feed ratio were examined
   for their effects on bio-oil yield and composition. Experimental results
   showed that microwave is an effective heating method for sewage sludge
   pyrolysis. Temperature has great influence on the pyrolysis process. The
   maximum bio-oil yield and the lowest proportions of oxygen-and
   nitrogen-containing compounds in the bio-oil were obtained at 550
   degrees C. The oil yield decreased when catalyst was used, but the
   proportions of oxygen-and nitrogen-containing compounds were
   significantly reduced when the catalyst to feed ratio increased from 1:1
   to 2:1. Essential mineral elements were concentrated in the bio-char
   after pyrolysis, which could be used as a soil amendment in place of
   fertilizer. Results of XRD analyses demonstrated that HZSM-5 catalyst
   exhibited good stability during the microwave-assisted pyrolysis of
   sewage sludge. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Designed appropriately, multiphase soft-core/hard-shell latex particles
   can achieve film formation without the addition of a coalescing aid,
   while preserving sufficient film hardness. Achieving optimal performance
   in these materials requires an understanding of how particle morphology
   affects film formation and stress development in the film. In this
   study, soft-core/hard-shell latex particles with different shell ratios,
   core and shell glass transition temperatures (T (g)s), and particle
   sizes (63-177 nm) were synthesized using a two-stage emulsion
   polymerization. The film formation behavior of the composite particles
   was investigated with cryogenic scanning electron microscopy, atomic
   force microscopy, and measurements of the minimum film formation
   temperature (MFFT). Results show that film formation was enhanced for
   particles with thinner hard shells, smaller particle size, and a smaller
   difference in T (g) between the core and shell polymers. For example,
   the MFFT decreased and the particle deformation increased for particles
   with thinner shells and smaller particle sizes. Stress development
   during drying was characterized using a cantilever beam bending
   technique. A walled cantilever design was used to monitor stress
   development without the complication of a lateral drying front. The film
   formation behavior and stress development correlated well with practical
   paint properties like scrub resistance and gloss.}},

   Soy ketal was compounded with polyvinyl chloride for evaluation of
   plasticizer properties such as efficiency, gelation, viscosity,
   volatility, thickening/aging behavior and stability. The thickening and
   aging behaviors of the soy ketal bioplasticizer are better than those of
   petroleum-based plasticizers such as diisononyl phthalate and

Abstract = {{The composition depth profile in organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs)
   is investigated using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) coupled
   with gas-cluster Ar-ion beam milling (Ar-GCIB). The XPS technique gives
   precise information about the surface chemistry of the organic thin
   films and is capable of differentiating the various charge transport,
   host and guest materials used in an OLED. The use of large Ar ion
   clusters (similar to 1500-2500 atoms/cluster) in the milling process
   allows for small amounts of the organic thin film to be sputtered away
   without contaminating the surface or damaging the underlying material
   chemistry. By probing OLEDs as a function of depth, key parameters
   including emissive layer composition and interface quality can be
   assessed directly. It is found that the depth profile for
   graded-composition emissive layer OLEDs closely matches the intended
   deposition profiles, maintaining both the composition gradient and the
   intended endpoint compositions. The ability to resolve and correlate
   subtle changes in film composition to variations in device performance
   will help inform efforts in device design, while also serving as a
   diagnostic tool to better understand the mechanisms for device
   degradation and failure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This work experimented on the TEOLED (Top-emitting Organic
   Light-Emitting Diode) using the TiN (titanium nitride) as the anode for
   the microdisplays based on the CMOS (Complementary
   Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) integrated circuit substrate. TiN is a hard,
   dense, and refractory material with steady physical and chemical
   characteristics. It is proved in this work to be a good candidate for
   the anode of the TEOLED due to its good electrical and optical
   characteristics. A SXGA resolution OLED microdisplay is designed and
   developed with TiN anodes. The luminance reaches beyond 2700 cd/m(2)
   when the operating voltage is below 5 V. The power efficiency reaches 13
   lm/W at the luminance of 1000 cd/m(2). As a conclusion, TiN can be used
   to solve the incompatibility problem between the CMOS process and the
   OLED process. By fabricating the top metal coated with TiN as the TEOLED
   anodes in the standard CMOS process, it is not necessary to build a new
   separate post-process line for the anodes in the mass manufacture.
   Hence, the process step for the CMOS-based OLED microdisplay will be
   simplified, huge cost will be saved and the production yield will also
   be improved. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A plane strain condition for testing rock is developed through passive
   restraint in the form of a thick-walled cylinder. The so-called biaxial
   frame generates the intermediate principal stress that imposes a
   triaxial state of stress on a prismatic specimen. Major and minor
   principal stresses and corresponding strains are accurately measured,
   providing data to calculate the elastic (Young's modulus and Poisson's
   ratio), inelastic (dilatancy angle), and strength (friction angle and
   cohesion) parameters of the rock. Results of experiments conducted on
   Indiana limestone in plane strain compression are compared with the
   results of axisymmetric compression and extension. With proper system
   calibration, Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio are consistent among
   the tests. The plane strain apparatus enforces in-plane deformation with
   the three principal stresses at failure being different, and it allows
   one to determine the Paul-Mohr-Coulomb failure surface, which includes
   an intermediate stress effect.}},

Abstract = {{Flooding service has been investigated extensively in wireless networks
   to efficiently disseminate network-wide commands, configurations, and
   code binaries. However, little work has been done on low-duty-cycle
   wireless sensor networks in which nodes stay asleep most of the time and
   wake up asynchronously. In this type of network, a broadcasting packet
   is rarely received by multiple nodes simultaneously, a unique
   constraining feature that makes existing solutions unsuitable. In this
   paper, we introduce Opportunistic Flooding, a novel design tailored for
   low-duty-cycle networks with unreliable wireless links and predetermined
   working schedules. Starting with an energy-optimal tree structure,
   probabilistic forwarding decisions are made at each sender based on the
   delay distribution of next-hop receivers. Only opportunistically early
   packets are forwarded via links outside the tree to reduce the flooding
   delay and redundancy in transmission. We further propose a forwarder
   selection method to alleviate the hidden terminal problem and a
   link-quality-based backoff method to resolve simultaneous forwarding
   operations. We show by extensive simulations and test-bed
   implementations that Opportunistic Flooding is close to the optimal
   performance achievable by oracle flooding designs. Compared with
   Improved Traditional Flooding, our design achieves significantly shorter
   flooding delay while consuming only 20-60\% of the transmission energy.}},

   deformation may bifurcate into an axially periodic toroidal twist-like
   mode by analyzing the related incremental boundary-value problem. The

Abstract = {{This study concerns the local behavior of the solutions of the governing
   equations of non-linear elastostatics in the vicinity of the corner of a
   wedge-shaped region of angle alpha is an element of (0, 2 pi]. It
   contains an asymptotic investigation in the plane strain regime - using
   a subclass of non-linear harmonic elastic solids that have a proper
   asymptotic constitutive structure in the vicinity of the corner - of the
   deformation field near the corner point that separates a free from an
   adjoining fixed segment of the boundary. It is well-known that, as the
   corner point is approached, the singular field behavior predicted by the
   classical linear theory of elasticity yields oscillatory deformations
   that are not injective. This anomalous behavior is related to a spurious
   self-intersection anomaly. Using a proper constitutive structure within
   a subclass of non-linear harmonic materials in the vicinity of the
   corner, we obtain an asymptotic expansion of the deformation field for
   which the foregoing anomalous behavior is avoided. The conditions on
   this field which guarantee injectivity lead to an unexpected behavior of
   the deformed free surface that is physically possible. In the particular
   case of alpha = pi, the second-order expansion of the deformation field
   agrees with its counterpart found elsewhere in the literature. For
   another particular case, concerning alpha = pi/2, the second-order
   expansion is an improvement over its counterpart found in the
   literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Performing planar biaxial testing and using nominal stress-strain curves
   for soft-tissue characterization is most suitable when (1) the test
   produces homogeneous strain fields, (2) fibers are aligned with the
   coordinate axes, and (3) strains are measured far from boundaries. Some
   tissue types {[}such as lamellae of the annulus fibrosus (AF)] may not
   allow for these conditions to be met due to their natural geometry and
   constitution. The objective of this work was to develop and test a
   method utilizing a surface displacement field, grip force-stretch data,
   and finite-element (FE) modeling to facilitate analysis of such complex
   samples. We evaluated the method by regressing a simple structural model
   to simulated and experimental data. Three different tissues with
   different characteristics were used: Superficial pectoralis major (SPM)
   (anisotropic, aligned with axes), facet capsular ligament (FCL)
   (anisotropic, aligned with axes, bone attached), and a lamella from the
   AF (anisotropic, aligned off-axis, bone attached). We found that the
   surface displacement field or the grip force-stretch data information
   alone is insufficient to determine a unique parameter set. Utilizing
   both data types provided tight confidence regions (CRs) of the regressed
   parameters and low parameter sensitivity to initial guess. This combined
   fitting approach provided robust characterization of tissues with
   varying fiber orientations and boundaries and is applicable to tissues
   that are poorly suited to standard biaxial testing. The structural
   model, a set of C++ finite-element routines, and a MATLAB routine to do
   the fitting based on a set of force/displacement data is provided in the
   online supplementary material.}},

Title = {{On the moving boundary conditions for a hydraulic fracture}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{147-155}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper re-examines the boundary conditions at the moving front of a
   hydraulic fracture when the fluid front has coalesced with the crack
   edge. This practically important particular case is treated as the zero
   fluid lag limit of the general case when the two fronts are distinct.
   The limiting process shows what becomes of the two boundary conditions
   on the fluid front, a pressure condition and a Stefan condition, when
   the lag vanishes. On the one hand, the pressure condition disappears as
   the net pressure (the difference between the fluid pressure and the
   magnitude of the far-field stress normal to the fracture) becomes
   singular. On the other hand, the Stefan condition, which equates the
   front velocity to the average fluid velocity, transforms into a zero
   flux boundary condition at the front. As a consequence, the velocity of
   the coalesced front does not appear explicitly in the boundary
   conditions. However, the front velocity can still be extracted from the
   near-tip aperture field by a nonlinear asymptotic analysis. The paper
   concludes with a description of an algorithm to propagate the combined
   front, which explicitly uses the known multiscale asymptotics of the
   fracture aperture. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Slot jet impingement heat transfer in the presence of jet-axis switching}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{50-57}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Jet-axis switching is an established phenomenon whereby a non-circular,
   three-dimensional free jet undergoes a major change in cross-sectional
   shape with increasing downstream distance from the jet origin. This
   phenomenon has been demonstrated here to also occur for impinging jets.
   The focus of the present work is to investigate the heat transfer and
   fluid flow characteristics of rectangular slot jets which experience
   jet-axis switching. The jets in question have initial cross-sectional
   aspect ratios of 5:1 and 10:1. The jet cross sections, although highly
   skewed at first, evolve through near circularity and subsequently become
   skewed in the direction perpendicular to that of the initial skewness.
   In addition to the two initial aspect ratios, parametric variations were
   made of the Reynolds number, the distance of the impingement plate from
   the jet origin, and the contraction experienced by the flow passing
   through the aperture of the jet-forming orifice (i.e., the blockage
   ratio). The investigation was implemented by means of numerical
   simulation from which local and average Nusselt numbers were determined
   as functions of the foregoing parameters. Higher Reynolds numbers,
   greater downstream distances of the impingement plate, and greater
   blockages served to enhance the Nusselt number values. It remains to be
   seen whether there is an initial jet aspect ratio that is large enough
   to preclude axis switching and thereby allow two-dimensional modeling.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{97-102}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The development of ultralast electron microscopy (UEM) and variants
   thereof (e.g., photon-induced near-field electron microscopy, PINEM) has
   made it possible to image atomic-scale dynamics on the femtosecond
   timescale. Accessing the femtosecond regime with UEM currently relies on
   the generation of photoelectrons with an ultralast laser pulse and
   operation in a stroboscopic pump-probe fashion. With this approach,
   temporal resolution is limited mainly by the durations of the pump laser
   pulse and probe electron packet. The ability to accurately determine the
   duration of the electron packets, and thus the instrument response
   function, is critically important for interpretation of dynamics
   occurring near the temporal resolution limit, in addition to quantifying
   the effects of the imaging mode. Here, we describe a technique for in
   situ characterization of ultrashort electron packets that makes use of
   coupling with photons in the evanescent near-field of the specimen. We
   show that within the weakly-interacting (i.e., low laser fluence)
   regime, the zero-loss peak temporal cross-section is precisely the
   convolution of electron packet and photon pulse profiles. Beyond this
   regime, we outline the effects of non-linear processes and show that
   temporal cross-sections of high-order peaks explicitly reveal the
   electron packet profile, while use of the zero-loss peak becomes
   increasingly unreliable. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved,}},

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed increased interests in topic detection and
   tracking (TDT). However, existing work mainly focuses on overall trend
   analysis, and is not developed for understanding the evolving process of
   topics. To this end, this paper aims to reveal the underlying process
   and reasons for topic formation and development (TFD). Along this line,
   based on community partitioning in social networks, a core-group model
   is proposed to explain the dynamics and to segment topic development.
   This model is inspired by the cell division mechanism in biology.
   Furthermore, according to the division phase and interphase in the life
   cycle of a core group, a topic is separated into four states including
   birth state, extending state, saturation state and shrinkage state. In
   this paper, we mainly focus our studies on scientific topic formation
   and development using the citation network structure among scientific
   papers. Experimental results on two real-world data sets show that the
   division of a core group brings on the generation of a new scientific
   topic. The results also reveal that the progress of an entire scientific
   topic is closely correlated to the growth of a core group during its
   interphase. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   method in several real-life scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Perforated plates are the preferred means of passive management of fluid
   flow proper and for convective heat transfer applications. The
   investigation reported here is a synergistic use of numerical simulation
   and experimentation to provide both in-depth fluid mechanic fundamentals
   and results for applications. The experimental results validated the
   choice of the turbulence model. A trio of dimensionless geometrical
   parameters was varied systematically, as was the Reynolds number to
   encompass both laminar and turbulent flows. For the laminar flow regime,
   higher pressure drops were associated with thicker plates and with the
   staggered-array hole pattern; higher porosities led to lower pressure
   drops. For the turbulent case, the thinner plate caused higher pressure
   drops as did the square-array hole pattern; also, the pressure drop was
   found to depend on the square of the Reynolds number, indicating the
   dominance of momentum-based losses. These trend reversals are
   attributable to the differences in separated-flow reattachment patterns
   for the different plate thicknesses. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All

Abstract = {{A method to synchronize and control a system of parallel single-phase
   inverters without communication is presented. Inspired by the phenomenon
   of synchronization in networks of coupled oscillators, we propose that
   each inverter be controlled to emulate the dynamics of a nonlinear
   dead-zone oscillator. As a consequence of the electrical coupling
   between inverters, they synchronize and share the load in proportion to
   their ratings. We outline a sufficient condition for global asymptotic
   synchronization and formulate a methodology for controller design such
   that the inverter terminal voltages oscillate at the desired frequency,
   and the load voltage is maintained within prescribed bounds. We also
   introduce a technique to facilitate the seamless addition of inverters
   controlled with the proposed approach into an energized system.
   Experimental results for a system of three inverters demonstrate power
   sharing in proportion to power ratings for both linear and nonlinear}},

Abstract = {{To gain deeper understanding of how the shape and size of particles
   influence their interaction with cells, the uptake process of polymer
   hydrogel nanotubes (PNTs) by cancer cells was characterized. The PNTs
   were composed of crosslinked poly(ethylene glycol) segments with a
   diameter of 300 nm and a polydispersed length in the range of 2 to 20 mu
   m. The uptake of PNTs into human cervical carcinoma epithelial (HeLa)
   cells cultured in vitro was monitored by confocal laser fluorescence
   microscopy and details of PNT entry into cells were revealed by a series
   of confocal Z-section images and time-lapsed video microscopy. It was
   found that PNTs initiating contact with the cell membrane through the
   tips of the tubes were readily taken up by the cells, whereas the uptake
   of tubes approaching the cell surface in parallel manner was very
   difficult. The length of the tubes did not appear to affect cellular
   uptake. In fact, it was found surprisingly that PNTs as long as > 10 mu
   m were internalized by these non-phagocytic cells. The rate of PNT
   uptake varied significantly and was probably influenced by the angle of
   attachment. Better understanding of the interaction between PNTs and
   cells may provide important insight in the use of PNTs as potential
   anticancer drug delivery vehicles.}},

   a spatially incoherent process, giving rise to incoherent optical

Title = {{Functional Study of NIPA2 Mutations Identified from the Patients with
   Childhood Absence Epilepsy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{Recently many genetic mutations that are associated with epilepsy have
   been identified. The protein NIPA2 ( non-imprinted in
   Prader-Willi/Angelman syndrome region protein 2) is a highly selective
   magnesium transporter encoded by the gene NIPA2 in which we have found
   three mutations (p.I178F, p.N244S and p.N334\_E335insD) within a
   population of patients with childhood absence epilepsy (CAE). In this
   study, immunofluorescence labeling, inductively coupled plasma-optical
   emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), MTT metabolic rate detection and
   computational modeling were utilized to elucidate how these mutations
   result in CAE. We found in cultured neurons that NIPA2 (wild-type)
   proteins were localized to the cell periphery, whereas mutant proteins
   were not effectively trafficked to the cell membrane. Furthermore, we
   found a decrease in intracellular magnesium concentration in the neurons
   transfected with mutant NIPA2, but no effect on the survival of neurons.
   To understand how low intracellular magnesium resulted in
   hyperexcitability, we built and analyzed a computational model to
   simulate the effects of mutations. The model suggested that lower
   intracellular magnesium concentration enhanced synaptic
   N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) currents. This study primarily
   reveals that a selective magnesium transporter NIPA2 may play a role in
   the pathogenesis of CAE.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate broadband non-resonant squeezing of terahertz (THz) waves
   through an isolated 2-nm-wide, 2-cm-long slit (aspect ratio of 10(7)),
   representing a maximum intensity enhancement factor of one million.
   Unlike resonant nanogap structures, a single, effectively
   infinitely-long slit passes incident electromagnetic waves with no
   cutoff, enhances the electric field within the gap with a broad 1/f
   spectral response, and eliminates interference effects due to finite
   sample boundaries and adjacent elements. To construct such a uniform,
   isolated slit that is much longer than the millimeter-scale spot of a
   THz beam, we use atomic layer lithography to pattern vertical nanogaps
   in a metal film over an entire 4-inch wafer. We observe an increasing
   field enhancement as the slit width decreases from 20 nm to 2 nm, in
   agreement with numerical calculations.}},

Abstract = {{We monitored the dynamics of cell dimensions and reporter GFP expression
   in individual E. coli cells growing in a microfluidic chemostat using
   time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. This combination of techniques
   allows us to study the dynamical responses of single bacterial cells to
   nutritional shift-down or shift-up for longer times and with more
   precision over the chemical environment than similar experiments
   performed on conventional agar pads. We observed two E. coli strains
   containing different promoter-reporter gene constructs and measured how
   both their cell dimensions and the GFP expression change after
   nutritional upshift and downshift. As expected, both strains have
   similar adaptation dynamics for cell size rearrangement. However, the
   strain with a ribosomal RNA promoter dependent reporter has a faster GFP
   production rate than the strain with a constitutive promoter reporter.
   As a result, the mean GFP concentration in the former strain changes
   rapidly with the nutritional shift, while that in the tatter strain
   remains relatively stable. These findings characterize the present
   microfluidic chemostat as a versatile platform for measuring single-cell
   bacterial dynamics and physiological transitions.}},

Abstract = {{The normal diaphragm has an inspiratory action on the lower ribs, but
   subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease commonly have an
   inward displacement of the lateral portions of the lower rib cage during
   inspiration. This paradoxical displacement, conventionally called
   `Hoover's sign', has traditionally been attributed to the direct action
   of radially oriented diaphragmatic muscle fibres. In the present study,
   the inspiratory intercostal muscles in all inter-spaces in anaesthetized
   dogs were severed so that the diaphragm was the only muscle active
   during inspiration. The displacements of the lower ribs along the
   craniocaudal and laterolateral axes and the changes in pleural pressure
   (Delta P-pl) and transdiaphragmatic pressure were measured during
   occluded breaths and mechanical ventilation at different lung volumes
   between functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity. From
   these data, the separate effects on rib displacement of Delta P-pl and
   of the force exerted by the diaphragm on the ribs were determined.
   Isolated spontaneous diaphragm contraction at FRC displaced the lower
   ribs cranially and outward, but this motion was progressively reversed
   into a caudal and inward motion as lung volume increased. However,
   although the force exerted by the diaphragm on the ribs decreased with
   increasing volume, it continued to displace the ribs cranially and
   outward. These observations suggest that Hoover's sign is usually caused
   by the decrease in the zone of apposition and, thus, by the dominant
   effect of Delta P-pl on the lower ribs, rather than an inward pull from
   the diaphragm.}},

Abstract = {{We established a strategy to perform cross-validation of serial optical
   coherence scanner imaging (SOCS) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) on a
   postmortem human medulla. Following DTI, the sample was serially scanned
   by SOCS, which integrates a vibratome slicer and a multi-contrast
   optical coherence tomography rig for large-scale three-dimensional
   imaging at microscopic resolution. The DTI dataset was registered to the
   SOCS space. An average correlation coefficient of 0.9 was found between
   the co-registered fiber maps constructed by fractional anisotropy and
   retardance contrasts. Pixelwise comparison of fiber orientations
   demonstrated good agreement between the DTI and SOCS measures. Details
   of the comparison were studied in regions exhibiting a variety of fiber
   organizations. DTI estimated the preferential orientation of small fiber
   tracts; however, it didn't capture their complex patterns as SOCS did.
   In terms of resolution and imaging depth, SOCS and DTI complement each
   other, and open new avenues for cross-modality investigations of the

Number = {{38}},
Pages = {{6074-6080}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies have identified triplet-triplet annihilation and
   triplet-polaron quenching as the exciton density-dependent mechanisms
   which give rise to the efficiency roll-off observed in phosphorescent
   organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs). In this work, these quenching
   processes are independently probed, and the impact of the exciton
   recombination zone width on the severity of quenching in various OLED
   architectures is examined directly. It is found that in devices
   employing a graded-emissive layer (G-EML) architecture the efficiency
   roll-off is due to both triplet-triplet annihilation and triplet-polaron
   quenching, while in devices which employ a conventional double-emissive
   layer (D-EML) architecture, the roll-off is dominated by triplet-triplet
   annihilation. Overall, the efficiency roll-off in G-EML devices is found
   to be much less severe than in the D-EML device. This result is well
   accounted for by the larger exciton recombination zone measured in G-EML
   devices, which serves to reduce exciton density-driven loss pathways at
   high excitation levels. Indeed, a predictive model of the device
   efficiency based on the quantitatively measured quenching parameters
   shows the role a large exciton recombination zone plays in mitigating
   the roll-off.}},

Abstract = {{A droplet of a colloidal suspension placed on an inclined substrate may
   sag under the action of gravity. Solvent evaporation raises the
   concentration of the colloidal particles, and the resulting viscosity
   changes may influence the sag of the droplet. To investigate this
   phenomenon, we have developed a mathematical model for perfectly wetting
   droplets based on lubrication theory and the rapid-vertical-diffusion
   approximation. Precursor films are assumed to be present, the colloidal
   particles are taken to be hard spheres, and particle and liquid dynamics
   are coupled through a concentration-dependent viscosity and diffusivity.
   Evaporation is assumed to be limited by how rapidly solvent molecules
   can transfer from the liquid to the vapor phase. The resulting
   one-dimensional system of nonlinear partial differential equations
   describing the evolution of the droplet height and particle
   concentration is solved numerically for a range of initial particle
   concentrations and substrate temperatures. The solutions reveal that the
   interaction between evaporation and non-Newtonian suspension rheology
   gives rise to several distinct regimes of droplet shapes and particle
   concentration distributions. The results provide insight into how
   evaporation and suspension rheology can be tuned to minimize sagging as
   well as the well-known coffee-ring effect, an outcome which is important
   for industrial coating processes.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic and natural polymers hold tremendous potential to improve
   therapeutic potency, bioavailability, stability, and safety through
   aiding the solubility of lipophilic drug candidates that may otherwise
   be clinically inaccessible. For the leading pharmaceutical delivery
   method (oral administration), one such approach involves maintaining
   drugs in an amorphous, nonequilibrium state using spray-dried
   dispersions (SDDs). However, few well-understood vehicles exist, and
   available formulations employ Edisonian approaches without regard to
   examining chemical, thermodynamic, and kinetic phenomena. Herein, we
   present a rational approach to study polymer drug interactions with a
   multicomponent polymer platform, inspired by hydroxypropyl
   methylcellulose acetate succinate (an excipient increasingly utilized as
   a delivery vehicle). The controlled syntheses of these modular analogs
   were strategically defined with (i) hydroxypropyl, (ii) methoxy, (iii)
   acetyl, (iv) succinoyl, and (v) glucose groups to tune the
   amphiphilicity balance (i v), ionization near gastrointestinal pH levels
   (iv), hydrogen bonding (i, iii, iv, v), and glass transition temperature
   (v). We examined how polymer architecture produces amorphous SDDs with a
   highly hydrophobic drug model (probucol, log P = 8.9). Dissolution
   experiments revealed dramatic differences in bioavailability as a
   function of polymeric chemical specificity. We identify chemically
   driven interactions as crucial ingredients for facilitating amorphous
   phase behavior and supersaturation maintenance. In particular,
   increasing the fraction of ionizable carboxylic acid moieties and
   selective deprotection of glucose acetates into hydroxyls established
   stabilizing ionic character and polar interactions. Our results show the
   utility of rationally designed polymer platforms, which we can precisely
   tune via monomer selection and functionality, as direct handles for
   elucidating important structure-property relationships in oral delivery.}},

Abstract = {{During cell division, a microtubule-based mitotic spindle mediates the
   faithful segregation of duplicated chromosomes into daughter cells.
   Proper length control of the metaphase mitotic spindle is critical to
   this process and is thought to be achieved through a mechanism in which
   spindle pole separation forces from plus-end-directed motors are
   balanced by forces from minus-end-directed motors that pull spindle
   poles together. However, in contrast to this model, metaphase mitotic
   spindles with inactive kinesin-14 minus-end-directed motors often have
   shorter spindle lengths, along with poorly aligned spindle microtubules.
   A mechanistic explanation for this paradox is unknown. Using
   computational modeling, in vitro reconstitution, live-cell fluorescence
   microscopy, and electron microscopy, we now find that the budding yeast
   kinesin-1 4 molecular motor Kar3-Cik1 can efficiently align spindle
   microtubules along the spindle axis. This then allows plus-end-directed
   kinesin-5 motors to efficiently exert the outward microtubule sliding
   forces needed for proper spindle bipolarity.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{OCT 13}},
Abstract = {{Reversible control of charge transport and magnetic properties without
   degradation is a key for device applications of transition metal oxides.
   Chemical doping during the growth of transition metal oxides can result
   in large changes in physical properties, but in most of the cases
   irreversibility is an inevitable constraint. Here we report a reversible
   control of charge transport, metal-insulator crossover and magnetism in
   field-effect devices based on ionically gated archetypal oxide system -
   SrRuO3. In these thin-film devices, the metal-insulator crossover
   temperature and the onset of magnetoresistance can be continuously and
   reversibly tuned in the range 90-250 K and 70-100 K, respectively, by
   application of a small gate voltage. We infer that a reversible
   diffusion of oxygen ions in the oxide lattice dominates the response of
   these materials to the gate electric field. These findings provide
   critical insights into both the understanding of ionically gated oxides
   and the development of novel applications.}},

Abstract = {{The selective transformation of hexose and pentose sugars to
   intermediate platform chemicals, such as furans, is an essential step in
   the conversion of cellulosic and hemicellulosic biomass to biofuels and
   biochemicals. Yet, many challenges in achieving commercially viable
   processes remain. In this feature article, we outline challenges that
   need to be overcome to enable these transformations. Then, we present
   the newly introduced acid-catalyzed isomerization of aldose sugars to
   ketose sugars via a class of solid Lewis acid catalysts (E.g., Sn-Beta,
   Ti-Beta). We elucidate mechanistic insights arising from subnanometer
   cooperativity and solvent effects that can be controlled to tune
   reaction pathways and selectivity and draw parallels between
   heterogeneous and homogeneous Lewis acid catalysts. Subsequently, we
   discuss fructose dehydration to 5-hydroxyl-methylfurfural (HMF) via
   homogeneous and heterogeneous Bronsted acid-catalyzed chemistry. We show
   how fundamental insights arising from the combination of kinetics,
   spectroscopy, and multiscale simulations rationalize the improved yield
   of HMF in water-organic cosolvents. The stability of heterogeneous Lewis
   acid catalysis under low pH enables tandem Bronsted and Lewis
   acid-catalyzed reactions in a single pot that overcomes equilibrium
   limitations and gives a high HMF yield starting from sugar raw
   materials. Additionally, we provide an overview of multicomponent
   adsorption of biomass derivatives from solution in microporous materials
   and discuss how structure-property relations can lead to superior micro-
   and micromesoporous carbon adsorbents for reactive adsorption toward
   high HMF yield. Finally, we provide and outlook for the field.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research has proposed integrating wastewater treatment with algae
   cultivations a way of producing algal biofuels at a commercial scale
   more sustainably. This study evaluates the environmental performance of
   wastewater-based algal biofuels with a well-to-wheel life cycle
   assessment (LCA). Production pathways examined included different
   nutrient sources (municipal wastewater influent to the activated sludge
   process, centrate from the sludge drying process, swine manure, and
   freshwater with synthetic fertilizers) combined with emerging biomass
   conversion technologies (micro-wave pyrolysis, combustion, wet lipid
   extraction, and hydrothermal liquefaction). Results show that the
   environmental performance of waste-water-based algal biofuels is
   generally better than freshwater-based algal biofuels, but depends on
   the characteristics of the wastewater and the conversion technologies.
   Of 16 pathway and the centratge cultivation with combustion pathway have
   lower impacts than petroleum diesel in all environmental categories
   examined (fossil fuel use, greenhouse gas emissions, eutrophication
   potential, and consumptive water use). The potential for large-scale
   implementation of centrate-based algal biofuel however, is limited by
   availability of centrate. Thus, it is unlikely that algal biofuels can
   provide a large-scale and environmentally preferable alternative to
   petroleum transportation fuels without considerable improvement in
   current production technologies. Additionally, the cobenefit of
   wastewater-based algal biofuel production as an alternate means of
   treating various wastewaters should be further explored.}},

Title = {{Proteomic Profiles in Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Differentiates
   Survivors from Non-Survivors}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) continues to have a high
   mortality. Currently, there are no biomarkers that provide reliable
   prognostic information to guide clinical management or stratify risk
   among clinical trial participants. The objective of this study was to
   probe the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) proteome to identify
   proteins that differentiate survivors from non-survivors of ARDS.
   Patients were divided into early-phase (1 to 7 days) and late-phase (8
   to 35 days) groups based on time after initiation of mechanical
   ventilation for ARDS (Day 1). Isobaric tags for absolute and relative
   quantitation (iTRAQ) with LC MS/MS was performed on pooled BALF enriched
   for medium and low abundance proteins from early-phase survivors (n =
   7), early-phase non-survivors (n = 8), and late-phase survivors (n = 7).
   Of the 724 proteins identified at a global false discovery rate of 1\%,
   quantitative information was available for 499. In early-phase ARDS,
   proteins more abundant in survivors mapped to ontologies indicating a
   coordinated compensatory response to injury and stress. These included
   coagulation and fibrinolysis; immune system activation; and cation and
   iron homeostasis. Proteins more abundant in early-phase non-survivors
   participate in carbohydrate catabolism and collagen synthesis, with no
   activation of compensatory responses. The compensatory immune activation

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to test the feasibility of a patient
   specific phantom for patient specific dosimetric verification.
   Using the head and neck region of an anthropomorphic phantom as a
   substitute for an actual patient, a soft-tissue equivalent model was
   constructed with the use of a 3D printer. Calculated and measured dose
   in the anthropomorphic phantom and the 3D printed phantom was compared
   for a parallel-opposed head and neck field geometry to establish tissue
   equivalence. A nine-field IMRT plan was constructed and dose
   verification measurements were performed for the 3D printed phantom as
   well as traditional standard phantoms.
   The maximum difference in calculated dose was 1.8\% for the
   parallel-opposed configuration. Passing rates of various dosimetric
   parameters were compared for the IMRT plan measurements; the 3D printed
   phantom results showed greater disagreement at superficial depths than
   other methods.
   A custom phantom was created using a 3D printer. It was determined that
   the use of patient specific phantoms to perform dosimetric verification
   and estimate the dose in the patient is feasible. In addition,
   end-to-end testing on a per-patient basis was possible with the 3D
   printed phantom. Further refinement of the phantom construction process
   is needed for routine use.}},

Abstract = {{Independent lines of research on urbanization, urban areas, and carbon
   have advanced our understanding of some of the processes through which
   energy and land uses affect carbon. This synthesis integrates some of
   these diverse viewpoints as a first step toward a coproduced, integrated
   framework for understanding urbanization, urban areas, and their
   relationships to carbon. It suggests the need for approaches that
   complement and combine the plethora of existing insights into
   interdisciplinary explorations of how different urbanization processes,
   and socio-ecological and technological components of urban areas, affect
   the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon emissions, differentially
   over time and within and across cities. It also calls for a more
   holistic approach to examining the carbon implications of urbanization
   and urban areas, based not only on demographics or income but also on
   other interconnected features of urban development pathways such as
   urban form, economic function, economic-growth policies, and other
   governance arrangements. It points to a wide array of uncertainties
   around the urbanization processes, their interactions with urban
   socio-institutional and built environment systems, and how these impact
   the exchange of carbon flows within and outside urban areas. We must
   also understand in turn how carbon feedbacks, including carbon impacts
   and potential impacts of climate change, can affect urbanization
   processes. Finally, the paper explores options, barriers, and limits to
   transitioning cities to low-carbon trajectories, and suggests the
   development of an end-to-end, coproduced and integrated scientific
   understanding that can more effectively inform the navigation of
   transitional journeys and the avoidance of obstacles along the way.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The expected urbanization of the planet in the coming century coupled
   with aging infrastructure in developed regions, increasing complexity of
   man-made systems, and pressing climate change impacts have created
   opportunities for reassessing the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in cities and how they contribute to greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions. Modern urbanization is predicated on complex, increasingly
   coupled infrastructure systems, and energy use continues to be largely
   met from fossil fuels. Until energy infrastructures evolve away from
   carbon-based fuels, GHG emissions are critically tied to the
   urbanization process. Further complicating the challenge of decoupling
   urban growth from GHG emissions are lock-in effects and
   interdependencies. This paper synthesizes state-of-the-art thinking for
   transportation, fuels, buildings, water, electricity, and waste systems
   and finds that GHG emissions assessments tend to view these systems as
   static and isolated from social and institutional systems. Despite
   significant understanding of methods and technologies for reducing
   infrastructure-related GHG emissions, physical, institutional, and
   cultural constraints continue to work against us, pointing to knowledge
   gaps that must be addressed. This paper identifies three challenge
   themes to improve our understanding of the role of infrastructure and
   technologies in urbanization processes and position these increasingly
   complex systems for low-carbon growth. The challenges emphasize how we
   can reimagine the role of infrastructure in the future and how people,
   institutions, and ecological systems interface with infrastructure.}},

Abstract = {{DNA damaging agents can promote aging, disease and cancer and they are
   ubiquitous in the environment and produced within human cells as normal
   cellular metabolites. Ironically, at high doses DNA damaging agents are
   also used to treat cancer. The ability to quantify DNA damage responses
   is thus critical in the public health, pharmaceutical and clinical
   domains. Here, we describe a novel platform that exploits
   microfabrication techniques to pattern cells in a fixed microarray. The
   `CometChip' is based upon the well-established single cell gel
   electrophoresis assay (a.k.a. the comet assay), which estimates the
   level of DNA damage by evaluating the extent of DNA migration through a
   matrix in an electrical field. The type of damage measured by this assay
   includes abasic sites, crosslinks, and strand breaks. Instead of being
   randomly dispersed in agarose in the traditional assay, cells are
   captured into an agarose microwell array by gravity. The platform also
   expands from the size of a standard microscope slide to a 96-well
   format, enabling parallel processing. Here we describe the protocols of
   using the chip to evaluate DNA damage caused by known genotoxic agents
   and the cellular repair response followed after exposure. Through the
   integration of biological and engineering principles, this method
   potentiates robust and sensitive measurements of DNA damage in human
   cells and provides the necessary throughput for genotoxicity testing,
   drug development, epidemiological studies and clinical assays.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the identification modeling and analysis of a
   miniature coaxial helicopter. The first part of the paper focuses on the
   development of the parameterized model with an emphasis on the coaxial
   rotor configuration. The model explicitly accounts for the dynamics of
   the lower rotor and uses an implicit lumped parameter model for the
   upper rotor and stabilizer bar. The parameterized model was identified
   using frequency domain system identification. The flight data collection
   experiments were performed in an indoor flight-test facility built
   around a commercial vision-based tracking system. The second part of the
   paper focuses on the verification of the model's accuracy, the
   consistency of the identified parameters, and the analysis of the flight
   dynamics. The accuracy was verified by comparing model-predicted
   responses with flight experimental responses. The identified parameters
   and model's physical consistency were examined using experiments in
   which specific aspects of the dynamics were isolated. For example, we
   used video images from a high-speed camera to verify the rotor and
   stabilizer bar time constants. Finally, the identified derivatives were
   verified based on first principles to demonstrate that the derivatives
   are physically meaningful.}},

Abstract = {{The incremental increase in contributing area along a main stem river,
   called here the incremental area function (IAF), has direct relevance to
   the spatial heterogeneity of environmental fluxes (water, sediment,
   nutrients, etc.) entering the stream from hillslopes and side
   tributaries. It also dictates, to a large extent, possible ecohydrologic
   discontinuities or transitions resulting from large tributary
   contributions. Mathematically, the IAF directly reflects the topological
   and geometrical structure of the river network and maps the
   two-dimensional landscape organization into a one-dimensional function.
   In this paper, we use two approaches to investigate the spatial
   heterogeneity of the IAF. First, we implement a multithreshold
   decomposition on IAF to study the distribution of distances between
   tributaries as a function of the imposed threshold contributing area and
   verify the presence of a simple power law scaling relationship between
   the threshold and the average distance between tributaries. Second, we
   use a wavelet-based multiscale approach and document the presence of
   statistical self-affinity (multifractality) in the IAF with a high
   intermittency coefficient, reflecting the complex arrangement of extreme
   contributions of different size tributaries. We propose a multiplicative
   cascade model, parameterized in terms of basin-specific properties, to
   statistically simulate the IAF along the main stem. Finally, we point
   out the relation between the IAF and the widely used width function of a
   basin and show how the latter can be constructed from the former via a
   convolution on the self-similar structure of a tree.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the robust secure beamformer design for
   multiple-input-single-output wiretap channels. Assuming that the
   eavesdroppers' channels are only partially available at the transmitter,
   we seek to maximize the secrecy rate under the transmit power and the
   secrecy rate outage probability constraint. The outage probability
   constraint requires that the secrecy rate exceed certain thresholds with
   high probability. Therefore, including such constraint in the design
   naturally ensures the desired robustness. Unfortunately, the presence of
   the probabilistic constraints makes the problem nonconvex and, hence,
   difficult to solve. In this paper, we investigate the outage probability
   constrained secrecy rate maximization problem using a novel two-step
   approach. Under a wide range of uncertainty models, our developed
   algorithms can obtain high-quality solutions, sometimes even exact
   global solutions, for the robust secure beamformer design problem.
   Simulation results are presented to verify the effectiveness and
   robustness of the proposed algorithms.}},

Title = {{A new formulation for steady multiaquifer flow: An analytic element for

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper contains a new formulation for infiltration inside domains
   bounded by polygons and its application to problems of steady
   multiaquifer flow, using the Dupuit-Forchheimer approximation and
   assuming vertical flow in the separating layers. An alternative
   formulation is presented for leaky aquifer systems where infiltration or
   extraction is given. Existing formulations of multiaquifer flow involve
   a system of equations that must be solved for the heads in the aquifers.
   These formulations are abstract, and the relation between the parameters
   in the solution and physical quantities is hidden. The formulation in
   the paper aims at linking the system of equations to physical
   quantities; we have done this in two ways. First, we formulate the
   problem in terms of leakage potentials, related directly to the leakage
   through the leaky layers. Second, we introduce the concept of
   equilibrated leakage, leakage that is either the result of infiltration
   or of some disturbance in the flow pattern, such as that caused by a
   well. The leakage through the leaky layers tends to some constant value
   far from a disturbance, e.g., a well, or the boundary of an area of
   constant infiltration. This concept of equilibrated leakage is useful in
   practice and helps in understanding the distribution of leakage; we
   explain this in detail in the paper. The study of problems of steady
   flow in leaky aquifer systems is inspired by problems of groundwater
   sustainability, where the overall distribution of flow over long periods
   of time is important, rather than detailed information.

   for Improved Social Recommendation}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{With the advent of online social networks, recommender systems have
   became crucial for the success of many online applications/services due
   to their significance role in tailoring these applications to
   user-specific needs or preferences. Despite their increasing popularity,
   in general, recommender systems suffer from data sparsity and cold-start
   problems. To alleviate these issues, in recent years, there has been an
   upsurge of interest in exploiting social information such as trust
   relations among users along with the rating data to improve the
   performance of recommender systems. The main motivation for exploiting
   trust information in the recommendation process stems from the
   observation that the ideas we are exposed to and the choices we make are
   significantly influenced by our social context. However, in large user
   communities, in addition to trust relations, distrust relations also
   exist between users. For instance, in Epinions, the concepts of personal
   ``web of trust{''} and personal ``block list{''} allow users to
   categorize their friends based on the quality of reviews into trusted
   and distrusted friends, respectively. Hence, it will be interesting to
   incorporate this new source of information in recommendation as well. In
   contrast to the incorporation of trust information in recommendation
   which is thriving, the potential of explicitly incorporating distrust
   relations is almost unexplored. In this article, we propose a matrix
   factorization-based model for recommendation in social rating networks
   that properly incorporates both trust and distrust relationships aiming
   to improve the quality of recommendations and mitigate the data sparsity
   and cold-start users issues. Through experiments on the Epinions
   dataset, we show that our new algorithm outperforms its standard
   trust-enhanced or distrust-enhanced counterparts with respect to
   accuracy, thereby demonstrating the positive effect that incorporation
   of explicit distrust information can have on recommender systems.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of thin cobalt film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy has
   been investigated on pristine graphene for spin logic and memory
   applications. By reduction of the kinetic energy of the sputtered atoms
   using indirect sputtered deposition, deposition induced defects in the
   graphene layer have been controlled. Cobalt film on graphene with
   perpendicular magnetic anisotropy has been developed. Raman spectroscopy
   of the graphene surface shows very little disorder induced in the
   graphene by the sputtering process. In addition, upon increasing the
   cobalt film thickness, the disorder density increases on the graphene
   and saturates for thicknesses of Co layers above 1 nm. The AFM image
   indicates a surface roughness of about 0.86 nm. In addition, the
   deposited film forms a granular structure with a grain size of about 40
   nm. (C) 2014 Author(s). All article content, except where otherwise

Volume = {{26}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper demonstrates the maintenance of self-sustaining turbulence in
   a restricted nonlinear (RNL) model of plane Couette flow. The RNL system
   is derived directly from the Navier-Stokes equations and permits higher
   resolution studies of the dynamical system associated with the
   stochastic structural stability theory (S3T) model, which is a second
   order approximation of the statistical state dynamics of the flow. The
   RNL model shares the dynamical restrictions of the S3T model but can be
   easily implemented by reducing a DNS code so that it retains only the
   RNL dynamics. Comparisons of turbulence arising from DNS and RNL
   simulations demonstrate that the RNL system supports self-sustaining
   turbulence with a mean flow as well as structural and dynamical features
   that are consistent with DNS. These results demonstrate that the
   simplified RNL system captures fundamental aspects of fully developed
   turbulence in wall-bounded shear flows and motivate use of the RNL/S3T
   framework for further study of wall-turbulence. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Journal = {{EARTH SURFACE PROCESSES AND LANDFORMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{13}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Two datasets of turbulence velocities collected over different bedform
   types under contrasting experimental conditions show similarity in terms
   of velocity-intermittency characteristics and suggest a universality to
   the velocity-intermittency structure for flow over bedforms. One dataset
   was obtained by sampling flow over static bedforms in different
   locations, and the other was based on a static position but mobile
   bedforms. A flow classification based on the velocity-intermittency
   behaviour is shown to reveal some differences from that based on an
   analysis of Reynolds stresses, boundary layer correlation and turbulent
   kinetic energy. This may be attributed to the intermittency variable,
   which captures the local effect of individual turbulent flow structures.
   Locations in the wake region or the outer layer of the flow are both
   shown to have a velocity-intermittency behaviour that departs from that
   for idealized wakes or outer layer flow because of the superposition of
   localized flow structures generated by bedforms. The combined effect of
   this yields a velocity-intermittency structure unique to bedform flow.
   The use of a time series of a single velocity component highlights the
   potential power of our approach for field, numerical and laboratory
   studies. The further validation of the velocity-intermittency method for
   non-idealized flows undertaken here suggests that this technique can be
   used for flow classification purposes in geomorphology, hydraulics,
   meteorology and environmental fluid mechanics. (c) 2014 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Amphipathic polymers known as ``amphipols{''} provide a highly
   stabilizing environment for handling membrane proteins in aqueous
   solutions. A8-35, an amphipol with a polyacrylate backbone and
   hydrophobic grafts, has been extensively characterized and widely
   employed for structural and functional studies of membrane proteins
   using biochemical and biophysical approaches. Given the sensitivity of
   membrane proteins to their environment, it is important to examine what
   effects amphipols may have on the structure and dynamics of the proteins
   they complex. Here we present the first molecular dynamics study of an
   amphipol-stabilized membrane protein, using Escherichia coli OmpX as a
   model. We begin by describing the structure of the complexes formed by
   supplementing OmpX with increasing amounts of A8-35, in order to
   determine how the amphipol interacts with the transmembrane and
   extramembrane surfaces of the protein. We then compare the dynamics of
   the protein in either A8-35, a detergent, or a lipid bilayer. We find
   that protein dynamics on all accessible length scales is restrained by
   A8-35, which provides a basis to understanding some of the stabilizing
   and functional effects of amphipols that have been experimentally
   observed.}},

Abstract = {{Amphipols are a class of polymeric surfactants that can stabilize
   membrane proteins in aqueous solutions as compared to detergents. A8-35,
   the best-characterized amphipol to date, is composed of a polyacrylate
   backbone with similar to 35 \% of the carboxylates free, similar to 25
   \% grafted with octyl side-chains, and similar to 40 \% with isopropyl
   ones. In aqueous solutions, A8-35 self-organizes into globular particles
   with a molecular mass of similar to 40 kDa. The thermal dynamics of
   A8-35 particles was measured by neutron scattering in the 10-picosecond,
   18-picosecond, and 1-nanosecond time-scales on natural abundance and
   deuterium-labeled molecules, which permitted to separate backbone and
   side-chain motions. A parallel analysis was performed on molecular
   dynamics trajectories (Perlmutter et al., Langmuir 27:10523-10537,
   2011). Experimental results and simulations converge, from their
   respective time-scales, to show that A8-35 particles feature a more
   fluid hydrophobic core, predominantly containing the octyl chains, and a
   more rigid solvent-exposed surface, made up predominantly of the
   hydrophilic polymer backbone. The fluidity of the core is comparable to
   that of the lipid environment around proteins in the center of
   biological membranes, as also measured by neutron scattering. The
   biological activity of proteins depends sensitively on molecular
   dynamics, which itself is strongly dependent on the immediate
   macromolecular environment. In this context, the characterization of
   A8-35 particle dynamics constitutes a step toward understanding the
   effect of amphipols on membrane protein stability and function.}},

   mechanical spectroscopy, small-angle X-ray scattering, and optical
   transmission measurements, exhibits increasingly second-order behavior
   as the BILE state is approached with increasing homopolymer content.
   Real-space transmission electron microscopy images obtained from rapidly
   frozen specimens evidence the development of large-scale fluctuating
   smectic correlations in the disordered state as the order-disorder
   transition is approached. This discovery provides fresh insights into
   the unexplained role of fluctuations in the formation of the B mu E in
   ternary mixtures formed from binary blends of homopolymers that display
   an Ising-like critical point and a symmetric diblock copolymer governed
   by a weak, fluctuation-induced, first-order phase transition.}},

Abstract = {{Experimental tests performed on quasi-brittle materials show that a
   process zone develops ahead of a crack tip. This zone can affect the
   strength and the deformation pattern of a structure. A discrete element
   approach with a softening contact bond model is utilized to simulate the
   development of the fracture process zone in the three-point bending
   tests. Samples with different dimensions and particle sizes are
   generated and tested. It is shown that as the material brittleness
   decreases, the width of the process zone becomes more dependent on the
   specimen size. Furthermore, the increase in the particle size, results
   in increase in the width of the process zone. A dimensional analysis
   together with the numerical results shows that the width of process zone
   is a linear function of particle size (radius). This finding is
   discussed and compared with published experimental data in the
   literature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The system reconfiguration task is considered for existing power
   distribution systems and microgrids, in the presence of renewable-based
   generation and load foresting errors. The system topology is obtained by
   solving a chance-constrained optimization problem, where loss-of-load
   (LOL) constraints and ampacity limits of the distribution lines are
   enforced. Similar to various distribution system reconfiguration
   renditions, solving the resultant problem is computationally prohibitive
   due to the presence of binary line selection variables. Further, lack of
   closed-form expressions for the joint probability distribution of
   forecasting errors hinders tractability of LOL constraints.
   Nevertheless, a convex problem reformulation is developed here by
   resorting to a scenario approximation technique, and by leveraging the
   underlying group-sparsity attribute of currents flowing on distribution
   lines equipped with tie and sectionalizing switches. The novel convex
   LOL-constrained reconfiguration scheme can also afford a distributed
   solution using the alternating direction method of multipliers, to
   address the case where multifacilities are managed autonomously from the
   rest of the system.}},

   extended period of time as traditionally used in North American

   the relationship for FR model compounds between laboratory and field
   results based on strength-temperature-RH (moisture content)-FR chemical
   interactions. Two previous studies evaluated the effects of various

Abstract = {{Here, we examine ultrafast photoluminescence produced from plasma-grown,
   colloidal silicon nanocrystals as a function of both particle size and
   lattice crystallinity. In particular, we quantify the decay time and
   spectral profiles of nominally few-picosecond direct-gap emission
   previously attributed to phononless electron-hole recombination. We find
   that the high-energy (400-600 nm, 2-3 eV) photoluminescence component
   consists of two decay processes with distinct time scales. The fastest
   photoluminescence exhibits an similar to 30 ps decay constant largely
   independent of emission energy and particle size. Importantly, nearly
   identical temporal components and blue spectral features appear for
   amorphous particles. We thus associate high-energy, rapid emission with
   an amorphous component in all measured samples, as supported by Raman
   analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. Based on these observations,
   we advise that the observed dynamics proceed too slowly to originate
   from intraband carrier thermalization and instead suggest a nonradiative
   origin associated with the amorphous component.}},

Abstract = {{The tetracycline operon is an important gene network component, commonly
   used in synthetic biology applications because of its switch-like
   character. At the heart of this system is the highly specific
   interaction of the tet repressor protein (TetR) with its cognate DNA
   sequence (tetO), TetR binding on tetO practically stops expression of
   genes downstream of tetO by excluding RNA polymerase from binding the
   promoter and initiating transcription. Mutating the tetO sequence alters
   the strength of TetR-tetO binding and thus provides a tool to synthetic
   biologists to manipulate gene expression levels. We employ molecular
   dynamics (MD) simulations coupled with the free enery perturbation
   method to investigate the binding affinity of TetR to different tetO
   mutants. We also carry out in vivo tests in Escherichia coli for a
   series of promoters based on these mutants. We obtain reasonable
   agreement between experimental green fluorescent protein (GFP)
   repression levels and binding free energy differences computed from
   molecular simulation. In all cases, the wild-type tetO sequence yields
   the strongest TetR binding, which is observed both experimentally, in
   terms of GFP levels, and in simulation, in terms of free energy changes.
   Two of the four tetO mutants we tested yield relatively strong binding,
   whereas the other two mutants tend to be significantly weaker. The
   clustering and relative ranking of this subset of tetO mutants is
   generally consistent between our own experimental data, previous
   experiments with different systems and the free energy changes computed
   from our simulations. Overall, this work offers insights into an
   important synthetic biological system and demonstrates the potential, as
   well as limitations of molecular simulations to quantitatively explain
   biologically relevant behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations using the explicit-hydrogen
   version of the transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPEEH)
   force field were carried out to predict the vaporliquid coexistence and
   critical properties of biphenyl, monochlorinated biphenyls, and of 16
   polychlorinated biphenyls. The predictions are in very good agreement
   with the limited experimental data. Transferring the TraPPEEH
   Lennard-Jones parameters from benzene to construct biphenyl yields
   predicted critical properties and normal boiling temperature with an
   average deviation of less than 1 \%. The saturated vapor pressures for
   biphenyl, 2-chorobiphenyl, and 4-chlorobiphenyl fall within 10 \% of the
   experimental data. Overall, the critical temperatures increase nearly
   linearly with the number of chlorine substituents and are correlated
   with the dipole moment for the monochlorinated isomers. In contrast,
   4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl, the most elongated compound, exhibits the highest
   critical temperature among the disubstituted biphenyls.}},

Abstract = {{Probabilistic models describing macroscopic traffic flow have proven
   useful both in practice and in theory. In theoretical investigations of
   wide-scatter in flow-density data, the statistical features of flow
   density relations have played a central role. In real-time estimation
   and traffic forecasting applications, probabilistic extensions of
   macroscopic relations are widely used. However, how to obtain such
   relations, in a manner that results in physically reasonable behavior
   has not been addressed. This paper presents the derivation of
   probabilistic macroscopic traffic flow relations from Newell's
   simplified car-following model. The probabilistic nature of the model
   allows for investigating the impact of driver heterogeneity on
   macroscopic relations of traffic flow. The physical features of the
   model are verified analytically and shown to produce behavior which is
   consistent with well-established traffic flow principles. An empirical
   investigation is carried out using trajectory data from the New
   Generation SIMulation (NGSIM) program and the model's ability to
   reproduce real-world traffic data is validated. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The existence of a cocrystal between curcumin (CUR) and phloroglucinol
   (PHL) was suspected but could not be demonstrated in a recent systematic
   effort to synthesize novel curcumin cocrystals. We hypothesize that the
   elusive CURPHL cocrystal is a kinetically stable form that can be
   prepared by trapping it using a fast solvent removal crystallization
   process. The polarity of crystallization solvent and relative solubility
   of cocrystal formers in the solvent appear to be critical parameters
   governing the phase purity of the resulting cocrystal. Organic solvents
   of higher polarity and in which the cocrystal formers exhibited
   congruent solubility tended to afford a purer cocrystal phase.
   Essentially phase-pure CURPHL cocrystals were successfully obtained from
   acetone, and their 1:1 stoichiometry was confirmed by differential
   scanning calorimetry and solid state nuclear magnetic resonance
   spectroscopy. Compared with the individual component phases, the
   cocrystal displayed reduced hygroscopicity and improved tabletability.
   However, the intrinsic dissolution rate of the cocrystal showed no
   significant improvement compared with the pure CUR crystal due to the
   instantaneous conversion of the cocrystal to CUR at its surface upon
   contact with the dissolution medium.}},

Abstract = {{Spatially propagating reaction waves are central to a variety of energy
   applications, such as high temperature solid phase or combustion
   synthesis, and thermopower waves. In this paper, we identify and study a
   previously unreported property of such waves, specifically that they can
   generate temperatures far in excess of the adiabatic limit. We show that
   this superadiabaticity occurs when a reaction wave in either one
   dimension (1D) or two dimensions (2D) impinges upon an adiabatic
   boundary under specific reaction and heat transfer conditions. This
   property is studied analytically and computationally for a series of 1D
   and 2D example systems, producing an estimate of the upper bound for
   excess temperature rise as high as 1.8 times the adiabatic limit,
   translating to temperatures approaching 2000 K for some practical
   materials. We show that superadiabaticity may enable several new types
   of energy conversion mechanisms, including thermophotovoltaic wave
   harvesting, which we analyze for efficiency and power density.}},

Title = {{In vitro assessment of induced phrenic nerve cryothermal injury}},
Journal = {{HEART RHYTHM}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Phrenic nerve injury, both Left and right, is considered a
   significant complication of cryoballoon ablation for treatment of
   drug-refractory atrial fibrillation, and functional recovery of the
   phrenic nerve can take anywhere from hours to months.
   OBJECTIVE The purpose of this study was to focus on short periods of
   cooling to determine the minimal amount of cooling that may terminate
   nerve function related to cryo ablation.
   METHODS Left and/or right phrenic nerves were dissected from the
   pericardium and connective tissue of swine (n = 35 preparations). Nerves
   were placed in a recording chamber modified with a thermocouple array.
   This apparatus was placed in a digital water bath to maintain an
   internal chamber temperature of 37 degrees C. Nerves were stimulated
   proximally with a 1-V, 0.1-ms square wave. Bipolar compound action
   potentials were recorded proximal and distal to the site of ablation
   both before and after ablation, then analyzed to determine changes in
   latency, amplitude, and duration. Temperatures were recorded at a rate
   of 5 Hz, and maximum cooling rates were calculated.
   RESULTS Phrenic nerves were found to elicit compound action potentials
   upon stimulation for periods up to 4 hours minimum. Average conduction
   velocity was 56.7 +/- 14.7 m/s preablation and 49.8 +/- 16.6 m/s
   postablation (P =.17). Cooling to mild subzero temperatures ceased
   production of action potentials for >1 hour.
   CONCLUSION Taking into account the data presented here, previous
   publications, and a conservative stance, during cryotherapy
   applications, cooling of the nerve to below 4 degrees C should be
   avoided whenever possible.}},

Journal = {{VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},

Abstract = {{There is a current and expanding need to measure surface infiltration
   rate parameters for stormwater infiltration practices used to mitigate
   the detrimental effects of land development activities on watershed
   hydrology. We have developed a falling-head soil surface infiltrometer,
   termed the modified Philip-Dunne (MPD) infiltrometer, that is
   inexpensive to construct, easy to use, and requires a minimal water
   volume per test. Because of these characteristics, many MPD devices can
   be deployed simultaneously to obtain infiltration rate data at multiple
   locations within a given infiltration practice. Green-Ampt theory was
   used to derive the expressions needed for analyzing the falling-head
   data to solve for the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-fs) and
   Green-Ampt wetting-front suction (psi). The accuracy of the analysis was
   determined using numerical experiments in which falling-head data were
   generated from a computational solution of the axisymmetric form of the
   three-dimensional Richards' equation for homogeneous and isotropic
   porous media with specified input parameters. The falling-head data were
   then analyzed using a quasi-analytical procedure, and the resulting
   values of K-fs and y were compared with the input values. The accuracy
   of K-fs and y derived from data acquired using the MPD device was then
   assessed using physical experiments involving three large barrels packed
   with different types of sand. The K-fs values obtained for the media in
   the barrels using an MPD infiltrometer were, on average, 82\% of the
   values obtained from whole barrel falling-head tests. The resulting
   uncertainty in K-fs values from the MPD infiltrometer is considered to
   be small compared with the orders of magnitude of variability commonly
   observed for K-fs values in the field.}},

Abstract = {{The potential benefits associated with harnessing available momentum and
   reducing turbulence levels in a wind farm composed of wind turbines of
   alternating size are investigated through wind tunnel experiments. A
   variable size turbine array composed of 3 by 8 model wind turbines is
   placed in a boundary layer flow developed over both a smooth and rough
   surfaces under neutrally stratified thermal conditions. Cross-wire
   anemometry is used to capture high resolution and simultaneous
   measurements of the streamwise and vertical velocity components at
   various locations along the central plane of the wind farm. A laser
   tachometer is employed to obtain the instantaneous angular velocity of
   various turbines. The results suggest that wind turbine size
   heterogeneity in a wind farm introduces distinctive flow interactions
   not possible in its homogeneous counterpart. In particular, reduced
   levels of turbulence around the wind turbine rotors may have positive
   effects on turbulent loading. The turbines also appear to perform quite
   uniformly along the entire wind farm, whereas surface roughness impacts
   the velocity recovery and the spectral content of the turbulent flow
   within the wind farm. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The enzymatic hydrolysates of the lipid-extracted microalgal biomass
   residues (LMBRs) from biodiesel production were evaluated as nutritional
   sources for the mixotrophic growth of Chlorella vulgaris and lipid
   production at different temperature levels and substrate concentrations.
   Both parameters had a significant effect on cell growth and lipid
   production. It was observed that C. vulgaris could grow mixotrophically
   in a wide range of temperatures (20 similar to 35 A degrees C). The
   optimal temperature for cell growth and lipid accumulation of the
   mixotrophic growth of C. vulgaris was between 25 and 30 A degrees C. The
   neutral lipids of the culture at 25 A degrees C accounted for as much as
   82 \% of the total lipid content in the microalga at culture day 8.
   Fatty acid composition analysis showed that the increase of saturated
   fatty acids was proportional to the increase in temperature. The maximum
   biomass concentration of 4.83 g/L and the maximum lipid productivity of
   164 mg/L/day were obtained at an initial total sugar concentration of 10
   g/L and an initial total concentration of amino acids of 1.0 g/L but
   decreased at lower and higher substrate concentrations. The present
   results show that LMBRS could be utilized by the mixotrophic growth of
   C. vulgaris for microalgal lipid production under the optimum
   temperature and substrate concentration.}},

Abstract = {{General approaches are presented for approximating the nonlinear
   dynamics of a commercial aircraft model by affine linear parameter
   varying (LPV) models that are used for the design of fault detection and
   diagnosis (FDD) systems. One part of the paper deals with the
   approximation of the nonlinear actuator dynamics, where a simple
   analytic model is derived that accurately describes a given nonlinear,
   (partly) black-box model in the whole flight envelope. The second part
   presents a new two step approach for generating an affine LPV model for
   the nonlinear aircraft dynamics. Starting from a given trim-point in the
   flight envelope, the goal of the first step is to maximize the size of
   the region around this trim point, for which the simple affine LPV
   description is still valid. The second step then tries to further
   simplify the affine LPV model, which helps to reduce both the
   computational burden for FDD synthesis methods and the order of the
   linear fractional representations (LFRs) that are generated from these
   LPV models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eutrophication of urban surface waters from excess nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) inputs remains a major issue in water quality management.
   Although much research has focused on understanding loading of nutrients
   from storm events, there has been little research to understand the
   contribution of baseflow, the water moving through storm drains between
   rainfall events. We investigated the relative contributions of baseflow
   versus stormflow for loading of water and nutrients (various forms of N
   and P) by the storm drain network in six urban sub-watersheds in St.
   Paul, MN, USA. Across sites, baseflow made substantial contributions to
   warm season (May-October) water yields (27-66 \% across sites), total N
   yields (31-68 \%), and total P yields (7-32 \%). These results show that
   while P was predominantly delivered by stormflow, N loading was similar
   between baseflow and stormflow. We found that baseflow was dominated by
   groundwater inputs, likely caused by interception of shallow groundwater
   by storm drains, but also that variability in N and P among sites was
   related in part to the connectivity of the storm drains to upstream
   lakes and wetlands in some watersheds. The substantial loading by
   groundwater-dominated baseflow, especially for N, implies that N
   management may require a broader focus on N source reduction, perhaps
   through improved land management, in order to prevent contamination of
   shallow groundwater via infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{An anatomical understanding of human coronary arterial and venous
   systems is necessary for device development and therapy applications
   that utilize these vessels. We investigated the unique use of
   contrast-CT scans from perfusion-fixed human hearts for
   three-dimensional visualization and analysis of anatomical features of
   the coronary systems. The coronary arterial and venous systems of eleven
   perfusion-fixed human hearts were modeled using contrast-CT and Mimics
   software. The coronary arteries that coursed near the major coronary
   veins, how close coronary arteries were to coronary veins, and the size
   of adjacent coronary arteries were recorded and analyzed. The majority
   of coronary veins were within 5 mm of a coronary artery somewhere along
   its length. Interventricular veins elicited the largest occurrence of
   overlaps. There was significant variability in the percentage of each
   vein that coursed within 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 mm of a nearby artery. The
   left marginal veins and anterior interventricular vein had the largest
   portion of the vein that coursed near a coronary artery. The right
   coronary artery most often coursed near the middle cardiac vein. The
   inferior veins of the left ventricle elicited the most variation in
   adjacent arteries. The left circumflex artery and/or branches of the
   circumflex artery coursed near the left marginal vein in all cases where
   there was an artery near the marginal vein. The wide variation of
   measurements reinforces the importance of a precise understanding of
   individualized cardiac anatomy in order to provide the highest quality
   care to cardiac patients. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

   Media}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Column experiments were performed to compare the removals of Cd, Cu, and
   Zn from synthetic storm water by bioretention media at 3.6 and 19.4
   degrees C and to investigate the potential for metals retained on the
   bioretention media to be mobilized by a 1,000 mg/L NaCl solution.
   Bioretention media were effective at capturing Cd and Zn at both
   temperatures with sorption capacities greater at the lower temperature
   and increasing with increasing compost volume fraction (CVF). Removal of
   the primarily particulate-phase Cu was reduced at the lower temperature,
   suggesting that removal of particulate metals at low temperatures is of
   greater concern. The NaCl pulse caused accumulated metals in the
   bioretention media to leach in the order of Cd > Zn >> Cu. The fractions
   of metal released from the columns in all cases were relatively small
   (<= 3.5\%) and decreased with increasing CVF. Overall, the results
   suggest that bioretention is likely to be effective for metals capture
   and retention under cold climate conditions, especially when then media
   contains at least 30\% compost by volume. (C) 2014 American Society of

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Batch and column experiments were conducted to investigate the effects
   of compost volume fraction (CVF; 0-50\%) on bioretention media hydraulic
   conductivity, toxic metal (i.e., Cd, Zn, and Cu) capture, and phosphorus
   (P) release. Three sources of compost were tested and all exhibited high
   Cd and Zn sorption capacities. Thus, metal breakthrough times in the
   columns increased with increasing CVF. Typical breakthrough behavior was
   not observed for Cu, because little to no Cu was observed in the column
   effluents after more than 1,000 pore volumes. The unique behavior of Cu
   was attributable to its precipitation in the synthetic storm water with
   removal primarily attributed to filtration rather than sorption.
   Although beneficial for metal removal from storm water, increasing the
   CVF of the media resulted in reduced hydraulic conductivity and
   significant release of P. The release of nutrients from compost is a
   significant concern, and addition of a second layer of media beneath the
   compost-amended sand to promote P retention, such as iron-amended sand,
   should be considered. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{Complex polynomial optimization problems arise from real-life
   applications including radar code design, MIMO beamforming, and quantum
   mechanics. In this paper, we study complex polynomial optimization
   models where the objective function takes one of the following three
   forms: (1) multilinear; (2) homogeneous polynomial; (3) symmetric
   conjugate form. On the constraint side, the decision variables belong to
   one of the following three sets: (1) the -th roots of complex unity; (2)
   the complex unity; (3) the Euclidean sphere. We first discuss the
   multilinear objective function. Polynomial-time approximation algorithms
   are proposed for such problems with assured worst-case performance
   ratios, which depend only on the dimensions of the model. Then we
   introduce complex homogenous polynomial functions and establish key
   linkages between complex multilinear forms and the complex polynomial
   functions. Approximation algorithms for the above-mentioned complex
   polynomial optimization models with worst-case performance ratios are
   presented. Numerical results are reported to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approximation algorithms.}},

   stress partitioning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{756}},
Pages = {{54-88}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{It is well-known that in a dense, gravity-driven flow, large particles
   typically rise to the top relative to smaller equal-density particles.
   In dense flows, this has historically been attributed to gravity alone.
   However, recently kinetic stress gradients have been shown to segregate
   large particles to regions with higher granular temperature, in contrast
   to sparse energetic granular mixtures where the large particles
   segregate to regions with lower granular temperature. We present a
   segregation theory for dense gravity-driven granular flows that
   explicitly accounts for the effects of both gravity and kinetic stress
   gradients involving a separate partitioning of contact and kinetic
   stresses among the mixture constituents. We use discrete-element-method
   (DEM) simulations of different-sized particles in a rotated drum to
   validate the model and determine diffusion, drag, and stress partition
   coefficients. The model and simulations together indicate, surprisingly,
   that gravity-driven kinetic sieving is not active in these flows.
   Rather, a gradient in kinetic stress is the key segregation driving
   mechanism, while gravity plays primarily an implicit role through the
   kinetic stress gradients. Finally, we demonstrate that this framework
   captures the experimentally observed segregation reversal of larger
   particles downward in particle mixtures where the larger particles are
   sufficiently denser than their smaller counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{When a battery-powered robot needs to operate for a long period of time,
   optimizing its energy consumption becomes critical. Driving motors are a
   major source of power consumption for mobile robots. In this paper, we
   study the problem of finding optimal paths and velocity profiles for
   car-like robots so as to minimize the energy consumed during motion. We
   start with an established model for energy consumption of DC motors. We
   first study the problem of finding the energy optimal velocity profiles,
   given a path for the robot. We present closed form solutions for the
   unconstrained case and for the case where there is a bound on maximum
   velocity. We then study a general problem of finding an energy optimal
   path along with a velocity profile, given a starting and goal position
   and orientation for the robot. Along the path, the instantaneous
   velocity of the robot may be bounded as a function of its turning
   radius, which in turn affects the energy consumption. Unlike minimum
   length paths, minimum energy paths may contain circular segments of
   varying radii. We show how to efficiently construct a graph which
   generalizes Dubins' paths by including segments with arbitrary radii.
   Our algorithm uses the closed-form solution for the optimal velocity
   profiles as a subroutine to find the minimum energy trajectories, up to
   a fine discretization. We investigate the structure of energy-optimal
   paths and highlight instances where these paths deviate from the minimum
   length Dubins' curves. In addition, we present a calibration method to
   find energy model parameters. Finally, we present results from
   experiments conducted on a custom-built robot for following optimal
   velocity profiles.}},

Title = {{Application of neural networks to quantify the utility of indices of
   biotic integrity for biological monitoring}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{195-208}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) or multimetric indices have been
   developed as an approach for monitoring and evaluating biological
   condition of aquatic organisms. Quantitative evaluations of IBIs to
   determine whether they can explicitly link environmental condition with
   anthropogenic activities are needed to effectively use them in
   management. Analytical approaches using supervised neural networks are
   potentially powerful techniques to evaluate IBIs. The goal of this study
   was to evaluate the use of neural networks to identify ecosystem
   characteristics related to IBI response and to explicitly quantify
   relationships between variables using sensitivity analyses. An aquatic
   macrophyte-based IBI developed for Minnesota lakes was used as an
   example. The study was particularly interested in the usefulness of
   neural networks to highlight key predictors of IBI performance and to be
   used as a technique to evaluate multimetric index performance in other
   systems or regions. Neural networks made accurate predictions of overall
   IBI scores using an independent dataset, whereas predictive performance
   of the models varied for individual metrics. Bootstrap analyses to
   evaluate the effects of different training data on model performance
   indicated that predictions were highly sensitive to the training data.
   More conventional modeling techniques, such as multiple regression,
   performed similarly in predicting IBI scores, although diagnostic tools
   developed for neural networks provided novel insight into variables
   influencing IBI response. We suggest that neural networks have the
   ability to quantify ecological relationships that affect biotic
   integrity, but the statistical uncertainty associated with multimetric
   indices may limit the use of predictive models to infer causation.
   Accordingly, the statistical properties of multimetric indices should be
   carefully evaluated during index development, with specific attention
   given to the diagnostic capabilities of individual metrics. (C) 2014

Volume = {{274}},

Abstract = {{First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations for the
   electronic structure problem require a solution of the Kohn-Sham
   equation, which requires one to solve a nonlinear eigenvalue problem.
   Solving the eigenvalue problem is usually the most expensive part in DFT
   calculations. Sparse iterative diagonalization methods that compute
   explicit eigenvectors can quickly become prohibitive for large scale
   problems. The Chebyshev-filtered subspace iteration (CheFSI) method
   avoids most of the explicit computation of eigenvectors and results in a
   significant speedup over iterative diagonalization methods for the DFT
   self-consistent field (SCF) calculations. However, the original
   formulation of the CheFSI method utilizes a sparse iterative
   diagonalization at the first SCF step to provide initial vectors for
   subspace filtering at latter SCF steps. This diagonalization is
   expensive for large scale problems. We develop a new initial filtering
   step to avoid completely this diagonalization, thus making the CheFSI
   method free of sparse iterative diagonalizations at all SCF steps. Our
   new approach saves memory usage and can be two to three times faster
   than the original CheFSI method. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The effect of ocean downwind swells on the harvesting of offshore wind
   energy is studied using large-eddy simulation of fully developed wind
   turbine array boundary layers, which is dynamically coupled with
   high-order spectral simulation of sea-surface wave field with and
   without the presence of a downwind swell. For the two moderate wind
   speeds of 7 m/s and 10 m/s considered in this study, the swell is found
   to induce a temporal oscillation in the extracted wind power at the
   swell frequency, with a magnitude of 6.7\% and 4.0\% of the mean wind
   power output, respectively. Furthermore, the averaged wind power
   extraction is found to be increased by as much as 18.8\% and 13.6\%,
   respectively. Statistical analysis of the wind field indicates that the
   wind speed in the lower portion of the boundary layer oscillates
   periodically with fast wind above the swell trough and slow wind above
   the swell crest, resulting in the observed wind power oscillation. The
   wind above the swell accelerates due to the strong wave forcing, causes
   a net upward flux of kinetic energy into the wind turbine layer, and
   thus acts to increase the extracted wind power of the turbines. For a
   high wind speed of 17 m/s, the wave-induced motion becomes relatively
   weak and the swell effect on the wind turbine performance diminishes.

   when making a left turn at a signalized intersection. As a secondary
   objective, based on the task analysis examination, we proposed several
   countermeasures for the reduction of collision between transit buses and
   pedestrians. The task analysis revealed that transit bus drivers engage
   in various tasks during all stages of a left-turn maneuver. The results
   also showed that the task demand is at a peak during the performance of
   one of the most critical tasks - detecting pedestrians. Non-driving
   tasks that transit bus drivers are required to perform (e.g., collecting
   fares, providing directions to passengers) further increase the tasks
   demands. Based on the results of the task analysis, we proposed several
   potential solutions for the reduction of collisions between transit
   buses and pedestrians. The proposed countermeasures included a
   technology-based (collision warning system for both drivers and the
   pedestrians) and infrastructure-based (protected left turn signal for
   buses only) solutions, as well as examination of individual factors
   (e.g., stress coping ability) and the relationship with different
   aspects of driving performance. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Since the early days of the Journal of Controlled Release, there has
   been considerable interest in materials that can release drug on an
   ``on-demand{''} basis. So called ``stimuli-responsive{''} and
   ``intelligent{''} systems have been designed to deliver drug at various
   times or at various sites in the body, according to a stimulus that is
   either endogenous or externally applied. In the past three decades,
   research along these lines has taken numerous directions, and each new
   generation of investigators has discovered new physicochemical
   principles and chemical schemes by which the release properties of
   materials can be altered. No single review could possibly do justice to
   all of these approaches. In this article, some general observations are
   made, and a partial history of the field is presented. Both open loop
   and closed loop systems are discussed. Special emphasis is placed on
   stimuli-responsive hydrogels, and on systems that can respond
   repeatedly. It is argued that the most success at present and in the
   foreseeable future is with systems in which biosensing and actuation
   (i.e. drug delivery) are separated, with a human and/or cybernetic
   operator linking the two. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Interpreting impedance spectra of organic photovoltaic cells-Extracting
   charge transit and recombination rates}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{Impedance spectroscopy has been widely used to extract the electron-hole
   recombination rate constant in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs). This
   technique is typically performed on OPVs held at open-circuit. Under
   these conditions, the analysis is simplified with recombination as the
   only pathway for the decay of excess charge carriers; transit provides
   no net change in the charge density. In this work, we generalize the
   application and interpretation of impedance spectroscopy for bulk
   heterojunction OPVs at any operating voltage. This, in conjunction with
   reverse bias external quantum efficiency measurements, permits the
   extraction of both recombination and transit rate constants. Using this
   approach, the transit and recombination rate constants are determined
   for OPVs with a variety of electron donor-acceptor pairings and
   compositions. It is found that neither rate constant individually is
   sufficient to characterize the efficiency of charge collection in an
   OPV. It is demonstrated that a large recombination rate constant can be
   accompanied by a large transit rate constant, thus fast recombination is
   not necessarily detrimental to OPV performance. Extracting the transit
   and recombination rate constants permits a detailed understanding of how
   OPV architecture and processing conditions impact the transient behavior
   of charge carriers, elucidating the origin of optimum device
   configurations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The production of metal nanoclusters composed of less than 10(3) atoms
   is important for applications in energy conversion and medicine, and for
   fundamental studies of nanomaterial nucleation and growth.
   Unfortunately, existing synthesis methods do not enable adequate control
   of cluster formation, particularly at atmospheric pressure wherein
   formation typically occurs on sub-millisecond timescales. Here, we
   demonstrate that ligand-free, unagglomerated nickel nanoclusters can be
   continuously synthesized at atmospheric pressure via the decomposition
   of bis (cyclopentadienyl) nickel(II) (nickelocene) in a
   spatially-confined microplasma process that rapidly quenches particle
   growth and agglomeration. The clusters were measured on line by ion
   mobility spectrometry (IMS) and further analyzed by atomic force
   microscopy (AFM). Our results reveal that stable clusters with spherical
   equivalent mean diameters below 10 (angstrom) over dot. are produced,
   and by controlling the nickelocene concentration, the mean diameter can
   be tuned up to similar to 50 (angstrom) over dot. Although diameter is
   often the sole metric used in nanocluster and nanoparticle
   characterization, to infer the number of atoms in AFM and IMS detected
   clusters, we compare measured AFM heights and IMS inferred collision
   cross sections to theoretical predictions based on both bulk matter
   approximations and density functional theory and Hartree-Fock calculated
   Ni nanocluster structures (composed of 2-15 atoms for the latter). The
   calculations suggest that Ni nanoclusters composed of less than 10(2)
   atoms can be produced repeatably with simple microplasma reactors.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusional mass transport in porous materials is important for
   shape-selective catalysis and separation technologies. To maximize
   turnover and catalytic site accessibility, hierarchical materials are
   synthesized with length scales as small as single crystal lattices
   (similar to 2 nm, MFI). While these materials are potentially efficient
   catalysts, they have been shown to exhibit apparent diffusivities that
   are orders of magnitude slower than those in bulk crystals. To evaluate
   the dependence of apparent diffusivity with particle size, the kinetics
   and mechanism have been characterized by frequency response methods for
   cyclohexane mass transfer into and out of silicalite-1 particles varying
   in size over two orders of magnitude. Development of a new mass
   transport model utilizes data obtained by frequency response to
   characterize two sequential rate limitations: intracrystalline diffusion
   and asymmetric surface barriers. Activation energy associated with
   transport into the surface (E-a,E-s = 20.8 kJ/mol) was observed to be
   significantly less than that of intracrystalline diffusion and release
   (E-a = 53.9 kJ/mol approximate to 54.1 kJ/mol = E-a,E--s). Surface pore
   blockages are proposed to dominate mass transport in small zeolite
   particles.}},

Abstract = {{We elucidate thermal conductivity along the screw dislocation line,

   and originates in the highly deformed core region, which represents a
   significant source of anharmonic phonon-phonon scattering. High strain
   reduces the phonon relaxation time, especially in the longitudinal

Abstract = {{Recent magnetotransport and neutron scattering measurements implicate
   interfacial magneto-electronic phase separation as the origin of the
   degradation in transport and magnetism in ultra-thin film La1-xSrxCoO3
   on SrTiO3(001). Here, using low temperature scanning tunneling
   microscopy and spectroscopy the first direct, real space observation of
   this nanoscopic electronic inhomogencity is provided. Films of thickness
   12.4 nm (32 unit cells) are found to exhibit spatially uniform
   conductance, in stark contrast to 4.7 nm (12 unit cell) films that
   display rich variations in conductance, and thus local density of
   states. The electronic heterogeneity occurs across a hierarchy of length
   scales (5-50nm), with complex correlations with both topography and
   applied magnetic fields. These results thus provide a direct observation
   of magneto-electronic inhomogeneity inSrTiO(3)(001)/La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 at
   thicknesses below 6-7 nm, in good agreement with less direct techniques.

Abstract = {{This paper presents a generic approach to characterize and analyze the
   adhesion energy between graphene and different materials using
   nanoindentation of an atomic force microscope (AFM), which is extremely
   essential and critical for variety of graphene based micro- and
   nano-devices. AFM was used to press a free-standing graphene beam down
   to a substrate. During the retraction, the adhesion force (named as the
   secondary pull-off force) was measured to analyze the adhesion energy
   between the graphene beam and the substrate. This approach is easy for
   manipulation and it can detect the adhesion energy after the device
   fabrication. According to our measurement, the graphene/SiO2,
   graphene/gold, and graphene/graphene adhesion energies per area are
   approximately 270 mJ/m(2), 255 mJ/m(2), and 307 mJ/m(2), respectively.
   This result was used to predict the performances and guide the design of
   graphene M/NEMS devices. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The practice of carbon capture and storage (CCS) requires efficient
   capture and separation of carbon dioxide from its gaseous mixtures such
   as flue gas, followed by releasing it as a pure gas which can be
   subsequently compressed and injected into underground storage sites.
   This has been mostly achieved via reversible thermochemical reactions
   which are generally energy-intensive. The current work examines a
   biocatalytic approach for carbon capture using an NADP(H)-dependent
   isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) which catalyzes reversibly carboxylation
   and decarboxylation reactions. Different from chemical carbon capture
   processes that rely on thermal energy to realize purification of carbon
   dioxide, the biocatalytic strategy utilizes pH to leverage the reaction
   equilibrium, thereby realizing energy-efficient carbon capture under
   ambient conditions. Results showed that over 25 mol of carbon dioxide
   could be captured and purified from its gas mixture for each gram of
   ICDH applied for each carboxylation/decarboxylation reaction cycle by
   varying pH between 6 and 9. This work demonstrates the promising
   potentials of pH-sensitive biocatalysis as a green-chemistry route for
   carbon capture. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The permeation of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium ({[}EMIM]),
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ({[}BMIM]), and 1-butylimidazole through the
   bilayer membranes of nanoemulsion-like polymersomes was investigated by
   nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) techniques.
   1,2-Polybutadiene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PBPEO) polymersomes in the
   ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide ({[}EMIM]{[}TFSI]) were prepared by a
   cosolvent method and then migrated to the aqueous phase, which is not
   miscible with the IL, at room temperature. In this way stable,
   nanoscopic domains of the IL (average diameter ca. 200 nm) were
   dispersed in water. Two similarly sized molecules, charged {[}EMIM] and
   neutral 1-butylimidazole, were employed as tracer molecules, and proton
   NMR (H-1 NMR) and pulsed-field-gradient NMR (PFG-NMR) experiments were
   conducted. Furthermore, transient H-1 NMR was used with {[}BMIM] to
   estimate how rapidly the charged molecules can go through the
   hydrophobic membrane into the polymersome interior. The molecules in the
   nanoemulsion solution showed two distinct sets of peaks due to the
   magnetic susceptibility difference across the membrane. This difference
   in H-1 NMR gave direct evidence of permeation of the molecules and the
   relative populations within the polymersomes versus in the aqueous
   exterior. The escape and entry rates were evaluated by fitting the
   PEG-NMR echo decay curves with a two-site exchange model. The molecules
   could permeate through the hydrophobic PB membranes on a time scale of
   seconds, but the entry and escape rates for the charged molecule
   ({[}EMIM]) were approximately 10 times slower than the neutral molecule
   (1-butylimidazole). These results confirm that this system has the
   potential to serve as a nanoreactor, facilitating reactions with various
   kinds of molecules including both charged and neutral molecules. It
   combines the facile transport and mixing of a majority aqueous phase
   with the multiple advantages of IL as a reaction medium. The ability to
   shuttle the polymersomes reversibly between aqueous and ionic liquid
   phases offers a convenient route to product separation and catalyst
   recovery.}},

Abstract = {{We report here an investigation of graphene field-effect transistors
   (G-FETs) in which the graphene channel is in contact with an electrolyte
   phase. The electrolyte and the ultrathin nature of graphene allow direct
   measurement of the channel electrochemical potential versus a reference
   electrode also in contact with the electrolyte. In addition, the
   electrolyte can be used to gate the graphene; i.e., a dual-gate
   structure is realized. We employ this electrolyte modified G-FET
   architecture to (1) track the Fermi level of the graphene channel as a
   function of gate bias, (2) determine the density of states (i.e., the
   quantum capacitance C-Q) of graphene, and (3) separate the gate induced
   band filling potential delta from the electrochemical double-layer
   charging potential Delta phi(EDL). Additionally, we are able to
   determine the electric double-layer capacitance CEDL for the
   graphene/electrolyte interface, which is similar to 5 mu F/cm(2), the
   same order of magnitude as CQ. Overall, the electrolyte modified G-FETs
   provide an excellent model system for probing the electronic structure
   and transport properties of graphene and for understanding the
   differences between the two gating mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{A novel digitally driven pixel circuit for active-matrix organic
   light-emitting diode (OLED) microdisplays is proposed and evaluated.
   This circuit supports both pulse width modulation and pulse density
   modulation digital drive approaches. Only three transistors and one
   capacitor are required per pixel for the proposed circuit. A current
   mirror is used to compensate for the pixel current changes that occur
   because of the degradation of the OLEDs over time. The compensation
   current depends on the potential of the common cathode, the properties
   of the current mirror, and the Width/Length (W/L) ratio of the drive
   transistor. The proposed digital pixel circuit also has advantages in
   circuit layout compared with analog pixel circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Economical and effective methods are needed to assess practices that
   reduce gas emissions. This project compared gas concentrations measured
   using semi-continuous sampling with dedicated gas analyzers versus
   concentrations obtained using 50 L Flex Foil bags filled over 24 h.
   Sampling was clone over four months in summer and early fall of 2010 and
   2011 from four biofilters (flat-bed with old media, A-frame, and two
   flat beds with either 10 cm or 5 cm screen birch mulch) treating air
   from deep manure pits below swine nurseries. Concentration ratios and
   percent reductions were calculated and compared using both sampling
   methods. The NH3, H2S, CO2, CH4, and N2O concentration data indicated
   that the 24 h bag sampling concentrations and percent reductions tracked
   the semi-continuous sampling concentrations and percent reductions well.
   Most (77\%) of the NH3 concentrations differences (24 h bag sample minus
   semi-continuous) were within +/- 2 ppm of the semi-continuous
   concentrations, 78\% of the H2S concentration differences were within
   +/- 200 ppb, 87\% of the CH4 concentration differences were within 10
   ppm, and 88\% of the N2O concentration differences were within +/- 75
   ppb. Ratio means for NH3, CO2, and N2O were close to one (between 0.95
   and 1.09). H2S ratio means varied from 0.61 in 2010 to 1.68 in 2011.
   Semi-continuous percent reduction results indicated that the four
   biofilters reduced NH3, H2S, and CH4 emissions. For three of the four
   biofilters, mean percent NH3 reductions ranged from 53\% to 86\%, mean
   percent H2S reductions ranged from 41\% to 74\%, and mean percent CH4
   reductions ranged from 8\% to 39\%. One biofilter reduced N2O
   concentrations by 17\% to 22\%, while three biofilters generated N2O by
   8\% to 81\%. The 24 h bag sampling system tested was an effective method
   for measuring gas concentrations and percent reductions of an air
   treatment system in the field based on NH3, CH4, and N2O.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Interest has been increasing in mining information from a huge amount of
   data for various purposes such as business processes, scientific
   discoveries, and security. MINDS (Minnesota INtrusion Detection System)
   is a tool utilizing data mining techniques to identify both known and
   unknown network intrusions. While performing well with a high degree of
   accuracy in detecting intrusions, MINDS is intrinsically limited due to
   its centralized design. At the same time, there are increasing needs for
   coordinating multiple distributed sites to find correlations of
   suspicious events and for sharing distributed anomaly data in different
   administrative domains since network intrusions become more
   sophisticated and harder to identify by a single site analysis. In this
   work, we consider a distributed model of MINDS to eliminate the
   limitations that the current MINDS suffers from due to its centralized
   nature. We utilize Grid technologies to achieve the distribution of
   services. In addition, we develop security frameworks for authentication
   and access control since it is important to preserve privacy and
   sensitivity of data regardless of distribution. To verify the
   feasibility of our approach, we also present our experimental results
   conducted in a local testbed with four nodes and in a wide-area setting
   in PlanetLab with 20 nodes geographically dispersed.}},

Abstract = {{Besides its importance in statistical physics and information theory,
   the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy S has become one of the most widely used
   and misused summary measures of various attributes (characteristics) in
   diverse fields of study. It has also been the subject of extensive and
   perhaps excessive generalizations. This paper introduces the concept and
   criteria for value validity as a means of determining if an entropy
   takes on values that reasonably reflect the attribute being measured and
   that permit different types of comparisons to be made for different
   probability distributions. While neither S nor its relative entropy
   equivalent S{*} meet the value-validity conditions, certain power
   functions of S and S{*} do to a considerable extent. No parametric
   generalization offers any advantage over S in this regard. A measure
   based on Euclidean distances between probability distributions is
   introduced as a potential entropy that does comply fully with the
   value-validity requirements and its statistical inference procedure is
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{We study the optimal design of a conductance network as a means for
   synchronizing a given set of oscillators. Synchronization is achieved
   when all oscillator voltages reach consensus, and performance is
   quantified by the mean-square deviation from the consensus value. We
   formulate optimization problems that address the tradeoff between
   synchronization performance and the number and strength of oscillator
   couplings. We promote the sparsity of the coupling network by penalizing
   the number of interconnection links. For identical oscillators, we
   establish convexity of the optimization problem and demonstrate that the
   design problem can be formulated as a semidefinite program. Finally, for
   special classes of oscillator networks we derive explicit analytical
   expressions for the optimal conductance values.}},

Abstract = {{Inducible utilization pathways reflect widespread microbial strategies
   to uptake and consume sugars from the environment. Despite their broad
   importance and extensive characterization, little is known how these
   pathways naturally respond to their inducing sugar in individual cells.
   Here, we performed single-cell analyses to probe the behaviour of
   representative pathways in the model bacterium Escherichia coli. We
   observed diverse single-cell behaviours, including uniform responses
   (d-lactose, d-galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, N-acetylneuraminic acid),
   all-or-none' responses (d-xylose, l-rhamnose) and complex combinations
   thereof (l-arabinose, d-gluconate). Mathematical modelling and probing
   of genetically modified pathways revealed that the simple framework
   underlying these pathways - inducible transport and inducible catabolism
   - could give rise to most of these behaviours. Sugar catabolism was also
   an important feature, as disruption of catabolism eliminated tunable
   induction as well as enhanced memory of previous conditions. For
   instance, disruption of catabolism in pathways that respond to
   endogenously synthesized sugars led to full pathway induction even in
   the absence of exogenous sugar. Our findings demonstrate the remarkable
   flexibility of this simple biological framework, with direct
   implications for environmental adaptation and the engineering of
   synthetic utilization pathways as titratable expression systems and for
   metabolic engineering.}},

Title = {{A data driven model for optimal orthosis selection in children with
   cerebral palsy}},
Journal = {{GAIT \& POSTURE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{539-544}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{A statistical orthosis selection model was developed using the Random
   Forest Algorithm (RFA). The model's performance and potential clinical
   benefit was evaluated. The model predicts which of five orthosis designs
   - solid (SAFO), posterior leaf spring (PLS), hinged (HAFO),
   supra-malleolar (SMO), or foot orthosis (FO) - will provide the best
   gait outcome for individuals with diplegic cerebral palsy (CP). Gait
   outcome was defined as the change in Gait Deviation Index (GDI) between
   walking while wearing an orthosis compared to barefoot (Delta GDI =
   GDI(Orthosis) - GDI(Barefoot)). Model development was carried out using
   retrospective data from 476 individuals who wore one of the five
   orthosis designs bilaterally. Clinical benefit was estimated by
   predicting the optimal orthosis and Delta GDI for 1016 individuals (age:
   12.6 (6.7) years), 540 of whom did not have an existing orthosis
   prescription. Among limbs with an orthosis, the model agreed with the
   prescription only 14\% of the time. For 56\% of limbs without an
   orthosis, the model agreed that no orthosis was expected to provide
   benefit. Using the current standard of care orthosis (i.e. existing
   orthosis prescriptions), Delta GDI is only +0.4 points on average. Using
   the orthosis prediction model, average Delta GDI for orthosis users was
   estimated to improve to +5.6 points. The results of this study suggest
   that an orthosis selection model derived from the RFA can significantly
   improve outcomes from orthosis use for the diplegic CP population.
   Further validation of the model is warranted using data from other
   centers and a prospective study. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This work deals with the use of chemically modified wheat straw as
   efficient low-cost adsorbent for combating oil-spills in aquatic
   environment. The autohydrolyzed wheat straw was produced from the
   corresponding raw material by autohydrolysis in a PARR batch reactor
   (autoclave) at 160-240 degrees C for 0-50 min isothermal reaction time
   (following a non-isothermal preheating period). Oil adsorbency tests
   were performed, using diesel and crude oil spills in freshwater and
   seawater. Diesel and crude oil adsorbency values were found to increase
   up to a maximum by intensifying the autohydrolysis conditions, i.e.,
   time and temperature. The adsorbency values were estimated by a proposed
   novel model incorporating the autohydrolysis severity factor R-0.
   Optimal modification conditions were found for log R-0 =5.15 (i.e., 200
   degrees C, 10 min isothermal time period) giving diesel adsorbency up to
   6.65 g g(-1) and crude oil adsorbency up to 6.91 g g(-1). The maximum
   adsorbency values were comparable to those of the commonly used
   commercial adsorbents. (C) 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

Abstract = {{This study investigates the dynamic magneto-mechanical behavior of
   magnetization-graded ferromagnetic materials Terfenol-D/FeCuNbSiB
   (IVLF). We measure the dynamic magneto-mechanical properties as a
   function of the DC bias magnetic field (H-dc). Our experimental results
   show that these dynamic magneto-mechanical properties are strongly
   dependent on the DC bias magnetic field. Furthermore, the dynamic strain
   coefficient, electromechanical resonance frequency, Young's moduli, and
   mechanical quality factor of Terfenol-D/FeCuNbSiB are greater than those
   of Terfenol-D under a lower DC bias magnetic field. The dynamic strain
   coefficient increases by a factor of between one and three, under the

Abstract = {{We report the photoluminescence (PL) properties of colloidal Si
   nanocrystals (NCs) up to 800 K and observe PL retention on par with
   core/shell structures of other compositions. These alkane-terminated Si
   NCs even emit at temperatures well above previously reported melting
   points for oxide-embedded particles. Using selected area electron
   diffraction (SAED), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), liquid drop theory,
   and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that melting does not
   play a role at the temperatures explored experimentally in PL, and we
   observe a phase change to beta-SiC in the presence of an electron beam.
   Loss of diffraction peaks (melting) with recovery of diamond-phase
   silicon upon cooling is observed under inert atmosphere by XRD. We
   further show that surface passivation by covalently bound ligands
   endures the experimental temperatures. These findings point to
   covalently bound organic ligands as a route to the development of NCs
   for use in high temperature applications, including concentrated solar
   cells and electrical lighting.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is a powerful technique to
   reduce power consumption in a chip multiprocessor. To support DVFS in
   the multicore power delivery network, we integrate on-chip
   switched-capacitor (SC) dc-dc converters that can work with multiple
   conversion ratios to provide varying levels of V-dd supplies. We study
   the application of such SC converters in multicore chips by simulation.
   Our results show that distributed SC converters can significantly reduce
   the voltage droop seen by the local core loads by providing better
   localized power regulation. Considering the fact that the current
   distribution in a multicore chip is unbalanced, we further develop
   computer-aided design techniques to automate the design (size) and
   distribution (number and location) of these SC converters, using the
   efficiency of the whole power delivery system as the optimization
   metric. This is a major concern, but has not been addressed at the
   system level in prior research. We develop models for the power loss of
   such a system as a function of size and distribution of the SC
   converters, then propose an approach to optimize the SC converters to
   maximize the efficiency of the system, while considering all the
   possible conversion ratios an SC converter can work with. We verify the
   accuracy of our models for the power loss in the power delivery system,
   and demonstrate the efficiency of our techniques to optimize the SC
   converters on both homogenous and heterogenous multicore chips.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed an algorithm to determine membrane structure, area per
   lipid, and bending rigidity from molecular dynamics simulations of lipid
   vesicles. Current methods to extract structure from vesicle simulations
   define densities relative to the global center of mass of the vesicle.
   This approach ignores the long-wavelength fluctuations (undulations)
   that develop across the sphere and broaden the underlying structure. Our
   method establishes a local reference frame by defining a radially
   undulating reference surface (URS) and thereby removes the broadening
   effect of the undulations. Using an arc-length low-pass filter, we
   render the URS by defining the bilayer midplane on an equi-angular ?,
   ?-grid (colatitude, longitude). This surface is then expanded onto a
   truncated series of spherical harmonics. The spherical harmonic
   coefficients characterize the long-wavelength fluctuations that define
   both the local reference frameused to determine the bilayers
   structureand the area per lipid (AL) along the undulating surface.
   Additionally, the resulting power spectrum of spherical harmonic
   coefficients can be fit to a Helfrich continuum model for membrane
   bending in spherical geometry to extract bending rigidity (k(c)). k(c)
   values determined for both DMPC and DMPC + cholesterol (30 mol \%)
   vesicles are consistent with values from corresponding flat-patch
   systems determined using an independent, previously published spectral
   method. These new tools to accurately extract structure, AL, and k(c)
   should prove invaluable in evaluating the construction and equilibration
   of lipid vesicle simulations.}},

Abstract = {{We develop, validate, and demonstrate the potential of Virtual StreamLab
   (VSL3D), a novel three-dimensional hydromorphodynamics computational
   model capable of simulating turbulent flow and sediment transport in
   natural waterways with embedded and arbitrarily complex hydraulic
   structures under live-bed conditions. The numerical model is based on
   the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) approach and can solve the
   unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (URANS) equations closed with
   the k - omega turbulence model in arbitrarily complex waterways with
   mobile sediment beds. Bed material transport is simulated by solving the
   nonequilibrium Exner equation for the bed surface elevation coupled with
   a transport equation for suspended load. Field-scale measurements
   obtained from experiments carried out in the St. Anthony Falls
   Laboratory Outdoor StreamLab are employed to validate the predictive
   capabilities of the numerical model. The VSL3D is used to develop a
   virtual testing environment of unprecedented resolution and physical
   realism for designing and optimizing the arrangements and installation
   of stream restoration rock structures. To our knowledge, the present
   work is the first systematic attempt to employ unsteady,
   three-dimensional, hydro-morphodynamics numerical modeling coupled with
   high-performance computing to develop an engineering framework for

Abstract = {{We sought design principles for a vaccine to prevent HIV transmission to
   women by identifying correlates of protection conferred by a highly
   effective live attenuated SIV vaccine in the rhesus macaque animal
   model. We show that SIVmac239 Delta nef vaccination recruits plasma
   cells and induces ectopic lymphoid follicle formation beneath the
   mucosal epithelium in the rhesus macaque female reproductive tract. The
   plasma cells and ectopic follicles produce IgG Abs reactive with viral
   envelope glycoprotein gp41 trimers, and these Abs are concentrated on
   the path of virus entry by the neonatal FcR in cervical reserve
   epithelium and in vaginal epithelium. This local Ab production and
   delivery system correlated spatially and temporally with the maturation
   of local protection against high-dose pathogenic SIV vaginal challenge.
   Thus, designing vaccines to elicit production and concentration of Abs
   at mucosal frontlines could aid in the development of an effective
   vaccine to protect women against HIV-1.}},

   greatly needed, particularly to protect women in the pandemic's
   epicenter in Africa. We have been seeking these principles by
   identifying correlates of the robust protection associated with
   SIVmac239 Delta nef vaccination in the SIV-rhesus macaque animal model
   of HIV-1 transmission to women. We identified one correlate of SIVmac239
   Delta nef protection against vaginal challenge as a resident mucosal
   system for SIV-gp41 trimer Ab production and neonatal FcR-mediated
   concentration of these Abs on the path of virus entry to inhibit
   establishment of infected founder populations at the portal of entry. In
   this study, we identify blocking CD4(+) T cell recruitment to thereby
   inhibit local expansion of infected founder populations as a second
   correlate of protection. Virus-specific immune complex interactions with
   the inhibitory Fc gamma RIIb receptor in the epithelium lining the
   cervix initiate expression of genes that block recruitment of target
   cells to fuel local expansion. Immune complex-Fc gamma RIIb receptor
   interactions at mucosal frontlines to dampen the innate immune response
   to vaginal challenge could be a potentially general mechanism for the
   mucosal immune system to sense and modulate the response to a previously
   encountered pathogen. Designing vaccines to provide protection without
   eliciting these transmission-promoting innate responses could contribute
   to developing an effective HIV-1 vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{Rock cutting represents a class of problems that exhibits
   ductile-brittle failure mode transition. Using the depth of cut as a
   structure size measure, this transition has been shown to follow
   Bazant's simple size effect law for quasibrittle material. This study
   showed that the finite element analysis with the adoption of a continuum
   damage material model could capture the ductile-brittle transition in
   rock cutting, and produced the size effect law. One of the major
   defining characteristics of rock cutting modeling is that no
   pre-existing notches were introduced, and that the crack grow path was
   not known a priori. The trend of how nominal stress-relative
   displacement varied with sizes was found similar to those of notched
   plates under simple tension or three point bending tests. That might
   imply a common response feature for mechanisms that satisfy the simple
   size effect law. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Sufficient conditions are derived for global asymptotic synchronization
   in a system of identical nonlinear electrical circuits coupled through
   linear time-invariant (LTI) electrical networks. In particular, the
   conditions we derive apply to settings where: i) the nonlinear circuits
   are composed of a parallel combination of passive LTI circuit elements
   and a nonlinear voltage-dependent current source with finite gain; and
   ii) a collection of these circuits are coupled through either uniform or
   homogeneous LTI electrical networks. Uniform electrical networks have
   identical per-unit-length impedances. Homogeneous electrical networks
   are characterized by having the same effective impedance between any two
   terminals with the others open circuited. Synchronization in these
   networks is guaranteed by ensuring the stability of an equivalent
   coordinate-transformed differential system that emphasizes signal
   differences. The applicability of the synchronization conditions to this
   broad class of networks follows from leveraging recent results on
   structural and spectral properties of Kron reduction-a model-reduction
   procedure that isolates the interactions of the nonlinear circuits in
   the network. The validity of the analytical results is demonstrated with
   simulations in networks of coupled Chua's circuits.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial spin ice comprises a class of frustrated arrays of
   interacting single-domain ferromagnetic nanostructures. Previous studies
   of artificial spin ice have focused on simple lattices based on natural
   frustrated materials. Here we experimentally examine artificial spin ice
   created on the shakti lattice, a structure that does not directly
   correspond to any known natural magnetic material. On the shakti
   lattice, none of the near-neighbour interactions is locally frustrated,
   but instead the lattice topology frustrates the interactions leading to
   a high degree of degeneracy. We demonstrate that the shakti system
   achieves a physical realization of the classic six-vertex model ground
   state. Furthermore, we observe that the mixed coordination of the shakti
   lattice leads to crystallization of effective magnetic charges and the
   screening of magnetic excitations, underscoring the importance of
   magnetic charge as the relevant degree of freedom in artificial spin ice
   and opening new possibilities for studies of its dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays an important role in
   nervous system function and has therapeutic potential. Microbial
   production of BDNF has resulted in a low-fidelity protein product, often
   in the form of large, insoluble aggregates incapable of binding to
   cognate TrkB or p75 receptors. In this study, employing Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae display and secretion systems, it was found that BDNF was
   poorly expressed and partially inactive on the yeast surface and that
   BDNF was secreted at low levels in the form of disulfide-bonded
   aggregates. Thus, for the purpose of increasing the compatibility of
   yeast as an expression host for BDNF, directed-evolution approaches were
   employed to improve BDNF folding and expression levels. Yeast surface
   display was combined with two rounds of directed evolution employing
   random mutagenesis and shuffling to identify BDNF mutants that had
   5-fold improvements in expression, 4-fold increases in specific TrkB
   binding activity, and restored p75 binding activity, both as displayed
   proteins and as secreted proteins. Secreted BDNF mutants were found
   largely in the form of soluble homodimers that could stimulate TrkB
   phosphorylation in transfected PC12 cells. Site-directed mutagenesis
   studies indicated that a particularly important mutational class
   involved the introduction of cysteines proximal to the native cysteines
   that participate in the BDNF cysteine knot architecture. Taken together,
   these findings show that yeast is now a viable alternative for both the
   production and the engineering of BDNF.}},

Abstract = {{Microbial oil accumulated by fungal cells is a potential feedstock for
   biodiesel production, and lignocellulosic materials can serve as the
   carbon source to support the fungal growth. The dilute acid pretreatment
   of corn stover can effectively break down its lignin structure, and this
   process generates a hydrolysate containing mostly xylose at very dilute
   concentration and numerous by-products that may significantly inhibit
   the cell growth. This study utilized corn stover hydrolysate as the
   culture media for the growth of Mucor circinelloides. The results showed
   that Mucor cells formed pellets during the cell growth, which
   facilitates the cell harvest from dilute solution. The results also
   showed that the inhibitory effect of furfural, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural
   (HMF), and acetic acid could be avoided if their concentration was low.
   In fact, all these by-products may be assimilated as carbon sources for
   the fungal growth. The results proved the feasibility to reuse the
   cultural broth water for acid pretreatment and then use for subsequent
   cell cultivation. The results will have a direct impact on the overall

Abstract = {{Cold-water habitat in lakes is projected to decrease under future
   climate scenarios, and existing trends suggest such declines are already
   impacting cold-water fish populations. Herein, we predict the effects of
   future climate and land use change on cold-water fish habitat in the
   glacial lakes of the upper midwestern US. Ecoregion-specific, regional
   regression models were developed to predict annual phosphorus loading
   rates to lakes based on land use and hydrology and coupled to a
   previously developed fish habitat model. Outputs from one land use
   change model and three global climate models were then used to project
   future cold-water habitat. Significant decreases in cold-water habitat
   quality were projected in all four ecoregions of the study region, with
   increases in air temperature generally having greater impacts on habitat
   than land use changes. Projected localized increases in urbanization and

Volume = {{15}},

Abstract = {{Recycling aged asphalt pavements into new asphalt pavements is a common
   practice in the pavement industry. The process involves adding the
   reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP) into a superheated asphalt mixing drum,
   where the binder contained within the RAP is expected to melt and be
   incorporated into the new hot-mix asphalt. Since the RAP is added part
   way through the mixing process, the amount of time spent inside the
   mixing drum is short and possibly insufficient for the RAP binder to
   melt and mix with the new asphalt binder. To address this issue, a
   numerical model is developed using the thermal properties of asphalt
   materials to investigate the melting potential of the RAP inside an
   asphalt mixing drum. Through a dimensionless analysis, the proposed
   model allows for the practice-ready calculation of the minimum time
   needed for any spherical particle to heat to a desired temperature given
   the initial temperature, ambient temperature, thermal diffusivity, and
   particle radius. Using the resulting equation, it is shown that there
   may be cases in which the RAP is not sufficiently heated inside an
   asphalt mixing drum.}},

Title = {{Braess paradox under the boundedly rational user equilibria}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART B-METHODOLOGICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{86-108}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{The Braess paradox and its variants have been studied under the
   perfectly rational behavior assumption. However, when the perfect
   rationality assumption is relaxed to bounded rationality, which assumes
   that travelers can take any route whose travel cost is within an
   `indifference band' of the shortest path cost, it remains unclear under
   what conditions the Braess paradox occurs. This paper fills this gap by
   exploring relationships between the occurrence of the Braess paradox and
   the indifference band as well as the demand level in the setting of the
   boundedly rational user equilibrium (BRUE). The definition of the Braess
   paradox is extended based on planners' risk-taking attitudes, i.e.,
   risk-averse, risk-prone and risk-neutral, due to the non-uniqueness of
   BRUE. The paradox occurrence conditions under different risk-taking
   attitudes are investigated using the classical Braess network and
   compared with those under the user equilibrium. Then we generalize the
   paradox conditions to simple and ordinary grid networks with regular
   Bureau of Public Roads (BPR) link performance functions. The impact of
   the link cost congestion sensitivity along with the indfference band on
   the occurrence of the Braess paradox is also studied. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Centrate, a type of nutrient-rich municipal wastewater was used to
   determine the effect of wastewater-borne bacteria on algal growth and
   nutrients removal efficiency in this study. The characteristics of algal
   and bacterial growth profiles, wastewater nutrient removal and effect of
   initial algal inoculums were systematically examined. The results showed
   that initial algal concentration had apparent effect on bacterial
   growth, and the presence of bacteria had a significant influence on
   algal growth pattern, suggesting symbiotic relationship between algae
   and bacteria at the initial stage of algae cultivation. The maximum
   algal biomass of 2.01 g/L with 0.1 g/L initial algal inoculums
   concentration can be obtained during algae cultivation in raw centrate
   medium. The synergistic effect of centrate-borne bacteria and microalgae
   on algae growth and nutrient removal performance at initial fast growth
   stage has great potential to be applied to pilot-scale wastewater-based

Abstract = {{Inter-area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically poorly
   controllable by means of local decentralized control. Recent research
   efforts have been aimed at developing wide-area control strategies that
   involve communication of remote signals. In conventional wide-area
   control, the control structure is fixed a priori typically based on
   modal criteria. In contrast, here we employ the recently-introduced
   paradigm of sparsity-promoting optimal control to simultaneously
   identify the optimal control structure and optimize the closed-loop
   performance. To induce a sparse control architecture, we regularize the
   standard quadratic performance index with an l(1)-penalty on the
   feedback matrix. The quadratic objective functions are inspired by the
   classic slow coherency theory and are aimed at imitating homogeneous
   networks without inter-area oscillations. We use the New England power
   grid model to demonstrate that the proposed combination of the
   sparsity-promoting control design with the slow coherency objectives
   performs almost as well as the optimal centralized control while only
   making use of a single wide-area communication link. In addition to this
   nominal performance, we also demonstrate that our control strategy
   yields favorable robustness margins and that it can be used to identify
   a sparse control architecture for control design via alternative means.}},

Abstract = {{The deterministic frequency response analysis and the stationary random
   vibration of large, linear structural models are often computationally
   intensive tasks. The computational expense is only exacerbated when
   stiffness and damping variabilities are present in the system's
   description. This paper proposes an approach for the highly
   computationally efficient and accurate computation of the sensitivities,
   to changes in design parameters that are spatially localized within some
   small portion of the computational model, of the transfer functions
   (TFs), power spectral densities, and mean-square responses of a
   structural system. The proposed method is derived, first for system TFs
   and then their sensitivities; the corresponding spectral densities are
   then derived using the TF approach. Finally, the proposed method is
   applied to two examples, one simple model where exact solutions can be
   computed, and a second, more realistic, building example with a
   high-order model that causes significant difficulties for standard
   state-space (SS) approaches in MATLAB as a result of numerical
   inaccuracies in the computations for very high-order SS models. The
   proposed method is shown to be highly accurate, with relative errors on
   the order of 10210, but is 4-6 orders of magnitude faster than
   conventional approaches. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{The time evolution of the parameter sensitivity of a nonlinear dynamical
   system is essential to its successful design, control, and
   identification. For an important class of systems, the governing
   equations of motion can be expressed as a linear system of ordinary
   differential equations augmented with a low-rank parameter-dependent
   (generally nonlinear) vector function. This paper builds on previous
   efforts by the authors to devise an approach for computing not only the
   responses of such systems but also the sensitivities of their responses
   to changes in design parameters in a computationally efficient manner.
   The proposed solution procedure first segregates the degrees of freedom
   appearing in the augmented functions from those that involve only linear
   deterministic operations. Second, the responses and sensitivities of the
   augmented terms are determined by solving the Volterra integral
   equations of reduced dimension. Finally, the responses and sensitivities
   of all remaining desired outputs are computed through a convolution
   approach using the fast Fourier transform to further increase the
   computational efficiency. The proposed method is applied to two
   examples, one simple linear model where exact solutions can be computed,
   and a second, more realistic, example of a wind-excited 20-story

Abstract = {{A small scale solar tracking concentrated photovoltaic thermal (CPV-T)
   system was investigated to enhance the energy efficiency of photovoltaic
   systems. The experimental measurement was firstly done to obtain the
   environmental parameters and on site efficiencies of the system. A novel
   Non-Dimensional Lattice Boltzmann Method (NDLBM) was then developed to
   simulate the transient fluid flow and heat transfer of the CPV-T
   receiver. This NDLBM establishes a whole set of dimensionless form of
   lattice Boltzmann equations and boundary conditions with dimensionless
   governing parameters in both macroscopic and mesoscopic length scales.
   The relaxation time is expressed in form of the mesoscopic Reynolds
   number instead of the viscosity, making the relationship between the
   mesh size and simulation range clearer. The present physics-based
   dimensionless inlet/outlet flow and heat flux boundary conditions make
   it possible to simulate the present high solar irradiance, large
   temperature difference, and high velocity mixed convection heat transfer
   problem. The effects of the flow rate, inlet flow temperature and
   distributions of the inlet/outlet on the heat transfer are obtained with
   NDLBM simulations over a wide range of Reynolds number, Rayleigh number,
   and Richardson number. The results provide a full understanding of the
   mechanics of the efficiency enhancement of the CPV-T system due to water
   cooling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The outcome of systemic and local therapies (e. g. chemotherapy,
   radiotherapy, surgery, focal ablation) for prostate cancer can be
   significantly improved by using tumor-specific adjuvants prior to
   treatment ({''}preconditioning{''}). We propose to use dynamic contrast
   enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to monitor the in vivo
   response of a mouse model of prostate cancer treated with a vascular
   disruptive agent, TNF-alpha, delivered on a gold nanoparticle (NP-TNF).
   Six male nude mice bearing 4-5 week old LNCaP tumors were scanned at 9.4
   T. DCE-MRI was performed two days before and 4-5 h after treatment with
   NP-TNF. An intraperitoneal (i.p.) bolus of gadolinium-DTPA (Gd) was
   administered and contrast enhancement was measured for 90 min.
   Concentration-time curves of Gd were calculated and the area under the
   Gd curve (AUGC) was determined pre- and post-treatment. NP-TNF treatment
   caused an increase in contrast uptake in tumors. Interestingly, the
   early concentration (10 min post Gd bolus i.p.) was similar in both
   untreated and treated conditions; however, 90 min after injection, {[}
   Gd] was 3.4 times higher than before treatment. AUGC doubled from (11
   +/- 6) {[} Gd] x min before treatment to (22 +/- 9) {[} Gd] x min after
   treatment. An increase in signal enhancement was also observed in the
   muscle but to a lesser degree. We also evaluated the kinetics of
   intravenous Gd administration in mice bearing a jugular vein catheter to
   mimic the delivery method used in clinical trials. The overall treatment
   effects were independent of the delivery pathway of the contrast agent.
   In conclusion, we show that DCE-MRI is suitable to detect changes
   associated with a vascular disruptive agent in a mouse model of prostate
   cancer. The ability to characterize the effects of nanoparticle therapy
   in vivo with non-destructive methods is important, as such compounds, in
   combination with treatment strategies, are progressing towards clinical
   trials. Copyright (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

   threat. Soybean lines that are low in polyunsaturated fats were
   generated by introducing mutations in two fatty acid desaturase 2 genes
   (FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B), which in the seed convert the monounsaturated
   fat, oleic acid, to the polyunsaturated fat, linoleic acid.
   Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered
   to recognize and cleave conserved DNA sequences in both genes. In four
   of 19 transgenic soybean lines expressing the TALENs, mutations in
   FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B were observed in DNA extracted from leaf tissue;
   three of the four lines transmitted heritable FAD2-1 mutations to the
   next generation. The fatty acid profile of the seed was dramatically
   changed in plants homozygous for mutations in both FAD2-1A and FAD2-1B:
   oleic acid increased from 20\% to 80\% and linoleic acid decreased from
   50\% to under 4\%. Further, mutant plants were identified that lacked
   the TALEN transgene and only carried the targeted mutations. The ability
   to create a valuable trait in a single generation through targeted
   modification of a gene family demonstrates the power of TALENs for
   genome engineering and crop improvement.}},

   with the purpose of detecting a uniform distribution of Fe3O4 magnetic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) for biological application. We find that the free

   MNPs, and consequent MNP stray fields lead to increased free layer
   susceptibility. This result persists even when MNPs are confined to the
   interior of the sensing region but is enhanced when MNPs are allowed
   near exterior edges. Our analysis includes three different fabrication

Abstract = {{Fiber-Reinforced-Polymer (FRP) strips can be glued to the surface of
   concrete or masonry structures to improve their strength. Pull-out tests
   on FRP bonds have shown a progressive failure of the adhesive joint
   involving early-stage cracking parallel to the axis of the FRP
   stiffener, and an inclined crack initiating at the free end of the
   stiffener and extending into the quasi-brittle substrate in the latest
   stage. The subsurface crack produces a characteristic wedge-shaped
   spall. There is no consensus on the reasons for the transition from
   cracking along the bond to cracking within the substrate. Therefore a
   Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics model problem is presented here that
   accounts for and provides improved understanding of the formation of the
   subsurface crack. The boundary value problem is solved analytically
   using the distributed dislocation technique. Competition between crack
   extension along the adhesive joint and into the substrate is quantified
   using a quantized crack propagation criterion, whereby the crack does
   not advance in infinitesimal continuous increments, but instead in
   finite steps of length comparable to the characteristic dimensions of
   the material microstructure. The model predicts results that are in good
   agreement with experimental evidence. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Global climate change and its impact on human life has become one of our
   era's greatest challenges. Despite the urgency, data science has had
   little impact on furthering our understanding of our planet in spite of
   the abundance of climate data. This is a stark contrast from other
   fields such as advertising or electronic commerce where big data has
   been a great success story. This discrepancy stems from the complex
   nature of climate data as well as the scientific questions climate
   science brings forth. This article introduces a data science audience to
   the challenges and opportunities to mine large climate datasets, with an
   emphasis on the nuanced difference between mining climate data and
   traditional big data approaches. We focus on data, methods, and
   application challenges that must be addressed in order for big data to
   fulfill their promise with regard to climate science applications. More
   importantly, we highlight research showing that solely relying on
   traditional big data techniques results in dubious findings, and we
   instead propose a theory-guided data science paradigm that uses
   scientific theory to constrain both the big data techniques as well as
   the results-interpretation process to extract accurate insight from
   large climate data.}},

Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{34}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{The strain-induced band structure change in a semiconductor can change
   its resistivity, known as the piezoresistive effect. If the
   semiconductor is also a piezoelectric material, strain-induced
   polarization charge can control the current transport at the
   metal-semiconductor contact, which is called a `piezotronic effect'.
   Piezotronic effect is intertwined with piezoresistive effect in the
   study of present piezotronic nanowire devices. Decoupling those effects
   will facilitate the fundamental study on the piezotronic devices and
   simplify the data analysis in real applications. Here, we report a
   general method to separate the piezotronic and piezoresistive effects in
   the same nanowire, based on modified four-point measurements. Current
   transport characteristics of each contact was extracted and showed
   different responses to the strain. The piezoresistive effect was
   measured in zinc oxide nanowires for the first time, and the result
   confirmed the dominant role of piezotronic effect in the strain-induced
   change of transport characteristics in a piezoelectric semiconductor.
   This study validates the assumption made in present piezotronic devices
   and provides a guideline for further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{We study the origin of a photocurrent generated in doped multilayer

   photothermal processes. The photothermoelectric current can be generated
   up to a micrometer away from the contacts, indicating a long thermal
   decay length. With an applied source-drain bias, a photobolometric
   current is generated across the whole device, overwhelming the
   photothermoelectric contribution at a moderate bias. The
   photoresponsivity in the multilayer BP device is two orders of magnitude
   larger than that observed in graphene.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric new particle formation (NPF) produces large numbers of
   nanoparticles which can ultimately impact climate. A firm understanding
   of the identity and contribution of the inorganic and carbonaceous

   importance of NPF. Here, we combine elemental and molecular nanoparticle
   composition measurements to better define the composition and
   contribution of carbonaceous matter to nanoparticle growth in a
   rural/coastal environment. We show that carbonaceous matter can account
   for more than half of the mass growth of nanoparticles and its
   composition is consistent with that expected for extremely low
   volatility organic compounds. An important novel finding is that the
   carbonaceous matter must contain a substantial amount of nitrogen, whose
   molecular identity is not fully understood. The results advance our
   quantitative understanding of the composition and contribution of
   carbonaceous matter to nanoparticle growth, which is essential to more
   accurately predict the climatic impacts of NPF.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon nanocrystals (Si NCs) have shown great promise for
   electroluminescent and photoluminescent applications. In order to
   optimize the properties of Si NC devices, however, electronic transport
   in Si NC films needs to be thoroughly understood. Here we present a
   systematic study of the temperature and electric field dependence of
   conductivity in films of alkyl-ligand-terminated Si NCs, which to date
   have shown the highest potential for device applications. Our
   measurements suggest that the conductivity is limited by the ionization
   of rare NCs containing donor impurities. At low bias, this ionization is
   thermally activated, with an ionization energy equal to twice the NC
   charging energy. As the bias is increased, the ionization energy is
   reduced by the electric field, as determined by the Poole-Frenkel
   effect. At large bias and sufficiently low temperature, we observe cold
   ionization of electrons from donor-containing NCs, with a characteristic
   tunneling length of about 1 nm. The temperature- and
   electric-field-dependent conductance measurements presented here provide
   a systematic and comprehensive picture for electron transport in lightly
   doped nanocrystal films.}},

Abstract = {{Essential topological indices of the hydrogen-bond networks of water,
   methanol, ethanol, and their binary mixtures adsorbed in microporous
   silicalite-1 (a hydrophobic zeolite with potential application for
   biofuel processing) are analyzed and compared to their bulk liquid
   counterparts. These include the geodesic distribution (the shortest
   H-bond pathways between molecular vertices), the average length, the
   geodesic index, the orientation and distance of the adsorbate to the
   interior of the zeolite, and the sorbate sorbate and sorbate sorbent
   distributions of H-bonds. In combination, they describe how the H-bond
   networks are altered when going from the bulk to the confined
   silicalite-1 environment. The speciation of the adsorbed compounds is
   quantified in terms of their network connectivity, revealing that pure
   water has a high probability of forming long, contiguous H-bonded chains
   in silicalite-1 at high loading, while alcohols form small
   dimeric/trimeric clusters. The extent to which the H-bond network of
   binary water alcohol systems is altered relative to either unary system
   is quantified, demonstrating an enhanced interconnectivity that is
   reflected in the tendency of individual H2O molecules to become
   co-adsorbed with alcohol clusters in the zeolite framework. Selectivity
   for the alcohol over water diminishes with increasing alcohol loading as
   the H-bonded clusters serve as favorable adsorption sites for H2O.}},

Abstract = {{Detailed experiments designed to optimize and understand the solvent
   vapor annealing of cylinder-forming poly(styrene)-block-poly(lactide)
   thin films for nanolithographic applications are reported. By combining
   climate-controlled solvent vapor annealing (including in situ probes of
   solvent concentration) with comparative small-angle X-ray scattering
   studies of solvent-swollen bulk polymers of identical composition, it is
   concluded that a narrow window of optimal solvent concentration occurs
   just on the ordered side of the order-disorder transition. In this
   window, the lateral correlation length of the hexagonally close-packed
   ordering, the defect density, and the cylinder orientation are
   simultaneously optimized, resulting in single-crystal-like ordering over
   10 mu m scales. The influences of polymer synthesis method, composition,
   molar mass, solvent vapor pressure, evaporation rate, and film thickness
   have all been assessed, confirming the generality of this behavior.
   Analogies to thermal annealing of elemental solids, in combination with
   an understanding of the effects of process parameters on annealing
   conditions, enable qualitative understanding of many of the key results
   and underscore the likely generality of the main conclusions. Pattern
   transfer via a Damascene-type approach verified the applicability for
   high-fidelity nanolithography, yielding large-area metal nanodot arrays
   with center-to-center spacing of 38 nm (diameter 19 nm). Finally, the
   predictive power of our findings was demonstrated by using small-angle
   X-ray scattering to predict optimal solvent annealing conditions for
   poly(styrene)-block-poly(lactide) films of low molar mass (18 kg
   mol(-1)). High-quality templates with cylinder center-to-center spacing
   of only 18 nm (diameter of 10 nm) were obtained. These comprehensive
   results have clear and important implications for optimization of
   pattern transfer templates and significantly advance the understanding
   of self-assembly in block copolymer thin films.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{90}},

Month = {{AUG 25}},
Abstract = {{In this work, we analyze the phononic characteristics of wave motion in
   precompressed monoatomic and diatomic granular chains, with emphasis on
   the evolving spatial features of wave packets. A Taylor series expansion
   of the governing equations is considered to approximate the granular
   chain with the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam chain. Within this approximation, the
   envelope modulation of the first-order features of the wave profile is
   monitored and the characteristics of this modulation are determined by
   studying the evolution of one of the distinctive features of the spatial
   profile. A set of constants that describe the quantitative effects of
   nonlinearity on the response are determined for monoatomic and diatomic
   chains and interpreted as invariants of quadratic nonlinearity. The
   universality of these invariants is verified by constructing inverse
   problems to estimate the contact power law from the wave response of
   granular chains with arbitrary nonlinear force interaction. The imposed
   power law is recovered exactly from numerical simulations for a number
   of considered scenarios, paving the way for inverse characterization of
   nonlinearity from experimental data.}},

Title = {{Separation and purification of biobutanol during bioconversion of
   biomass}},
Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{132}},
Pages = {{513-540}},
Month = {{AUG 20}},
Abstract = {{Biofuels from biomass are becoming increasingly more important, due to
   the need for reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, energy
   independence, and limited global availability and increasing demand and
   costs of fossil fuels. Butanol has several advantages over ethanol as a
   drop-in biofuel such as higher energy content, potential for higher
   blending percentage with gasoline, lower vapor pressure, and lower
   hygroscopy. It can be used in existing transportation fuel distribution
   infrastructure. Butanol can be produced by fermentation of carbohydrates
   derived from biomass using Clostridium acetobutylicum or C beijerinckii
   under anaerobic conditions. There are still many unsolved challenges for
   making biobutanol technically, and economically viable. The unsolved
   challenges lie in severe product (especially butanol) inhibition during
   bioprocessing, which leads to low butanol yield and productivity, and
   very low final product concentration (<3 wt\%), causing expensive
   downstream processing (product separation) costs. There are two ways for
   solving these problems. One is the modification of microorganisms for
   ABE (Acetone, Butanol and Ethanol) fermentation by genetic engineering,
   which could keep the microorganisms alive and active under higher
   concentration of products in the broth. This could significantly
   increase the product yield, productivity, and concentration and hence
   reduce the production costs. However, this is still an unrealized long
   term goal. Another approach is the development of efficient separation
   and purification processes for product recovery. And, even if the
   modification of microorganisms becomes a reality, product separation and
   purification will still remain a major critical challenge. In this
   study, an extensive review of separation and purification of butanol
   from fermentation broth is provided, including gas stripping, vacuum
   flash, liquid-liquid extraction, membrane solvent extraction or
   perstraction, membrane pervaporation, membrane distillation,
   thermopervaporation, reverse osmosis, adsorption, and integrated
   bioprocessing with various separation methods. It is concluded that
   membrane pervaporation, solvent extraction, and adsorption are the most
   energy-efficient approaches for removal of butanol from the ABE
   fermentation broths. It should be noted that this is not a strict
   comparison and it is suggested that each separation process should be
   optimized before comparison. Integration of bioreactors with these
   energy-efficient separation methods could significantly increase the
   product yield, productivity and concentration and hence lower the
   production cost. Butanol dehydration is also discussed. This review
   could be helpful in the research and development and commercialization
   of biobutanol as renewable drop-in biofuels and biochemicals. (C) 2014

Title = {{A multifunctional ribonuclease A-conjugated carbon dot cluster
   nanosystem for synchronous cancer imaging and therapy}},
Journal = {{NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Carbon dots exhibit great potential in applications such as molecular
   imaging and in vivo molecular tracking. However, how to enhance
   fluorescence intensity of carbon dots has become a great challenge.
   Herein, we report for the first time a new strategy to synthesize
   fluorescent carbon dots (C-dots) with high quantum yields by using
   ribonuclease A (RNase A) as a biomolecular templating agent under
   microwave irradiation. The synthesized RNase A-conjugated carbon dots
   (RNase A@C-dots) exhibited quantum yields of 24.20\%. The fluorescent
   color of the RNase A@C-dots can easily be adjusted by varying the
   microwave reaction time and microwave power. Moreover, the emission
   wavelength and intensity of RNase A@C-dots displayed a marked excitation
   wavelength-dependent character. As the excitation wavelength alters from
   300 to 500 nm, the photoluminescence (PL) peak exhibits gradually
   redshifts from 450 to 550 nm, and the intensity reaches its maximum at
   an excitation wavelength of 380 nm. Its Stokes shift is about 80 nm.
   Notably, the PL intensity is gradually decreasing as the pH increases,
   almost linearly dependent, and it reaches the maximum at a pH = 2
   condition; the emission peaks also show clearly a redshift, which may be
   caused by the high activity and perfective dispersion of RNase A in a
   lower pH solution. In high pH solution, RNase A tends to form RNase A
   warped carbon dot nanoclusters. Cell imaging confirmed that the RNase
   A@C-dots could enter into the cytoplasm through cell endocytosis. 3D
   confocal imaging and transmission electron microscopy observation
   confirmed partial RNase A@C-dots located inside the nucleus. MTT and
   real-time cell electronic sensing (RT-CES) analysis showed that the
   RNase A@C-dots could effectively inhibit the growth of MGC-803 cells.
   Intra-tumor injection test of RNase A@C-dots showed that RNase A@C-dots
   could be used for imaging in vivo gastric cancer cells. In conclusion,
   the as-prepared RNase A@C-dots are suitable for simultaneous therapy and
   in vivo fluorescence imaging of nude mice loaded with gastric cancer or
   other tumors.}},

Abstract = {{The central auditory system has traditionally been divided into
   lemniscal and nonlemniscal pathways leading from the midbrain through
   the thalamus to the cortex. This view has served as an organizing
   principle for studying, modeling, and understanding the encoding of
   sound within the brain. However, there is evidence that the lemniscal
   pathway could be further divided into at least two subpathways, each
   potentially coding for sound in different ways. We investigated whether
   such an interpretation is supported by the spatial distribution of
   response features in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
   (ICC), the part of the auditory midbrain assigned to the lemniscal
   pathway. We recorded responses to pure tone stimuli in the ICC of
   ketamine-xylazineanesthetized guinea pigs and used three-dimensional
   brain reconstruction techniques to map the location of the recording
   sites. Compared with neurons in caudal-and-medial regions within an
   isofrequency lamina of the ICC, neurons in rostral-and-lateral regions
   responded with shorter first-spike latencies with less spiking jitter,
   shorter durations of spiking responses, a higher proportion of spikes
   occurring near the onset of the stimulus, lower thresholds, and larger
   local field potentials with shorter latencies. Further analysis revealed
   two distinct clusters of response features located in either the
   caudal-and-medial or the rostral-and-lateral parts of the isofrequency
   laminae of the ICC. Thus we report substantial differences in coding
   properties in two regions of the ICC that are consistent with the
   hypothesis that the lemniscal pathway is made up of at least two
   distinct subpathways from the midbrain up to the cortex.}},

   poly(NIPAAm-coSPO-co-fluorophore), in water-in-oil (W/O) droplets is
   described. The photoresponsive aqueous droplets were generated in the
   coflow regime of a simple tubular microfluidic device. The phase
   separation of the copolymer in the W/O droplets was induced by UV light
   at 365 nm and was affected significantly by the presence of
   2,2-diethoxyacetophenone (DEAP) and sorbitan monooleate (Span 80). When
   the droplets were subjected to UV irradiation for more than 2 min, the
   phase-separated copolymer was transferred completely from the aqueous
   droplet to the continuous phase of hexadecane. The phase separation
   arises from the photoisomerization shifting the spiro to the merocyanine
   form of the SPO pendant group in the copolymer, which in turn reduces
   the hydrophilicity of the copolymer via attractive hydrogen-bonding
   interactions between the merocyanine group and hydrophobic additives,
   i.e., Span 80, DEAP, and some stable fragments derived from the
   photocleavage of DEAP under UV irradiation. These interactions cause the
   copolymer to associate with the additives and then accelerate the phase
   separation of the copolymer and subsequent phase transfer of copolymer
   aggregates. The separate effects of DEAP and Span 80 were also
   investigated by UV spectrophotometric analysis of the rate coefficient
   of the reverse transformation (merocyanine to spiro) of the photochromic
   monomer. We propose a mechanism of phase separation of the copolymer in
   the W/O droplet based on the NMR and GC-MASS analyses of DEAP.}},

Title = {{Polyether Urethane Hydrolytic Stability after Exposure to Deoxygenated
   Water}},
Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{15}},
Pages = {{5220-5226}},

Abstract = {{A medical grade, commercially available polyether urethane, denoted PEU
   80A, was exposed to both real time (37 degrees C) and temperature
   accelerated (55, 70, and 85 degrees C) hydrolysis conditions for a
   period of one year in vitro. Neutral pH and deoxygenated phosphate
   buffered saline exposure conditions mitigated the well-studied oxidation
   reaction, allowing for evaluation of hydrolysis events. The hydrolytic
   sensitivity of the PEU 80A was analyzed using nuclear magnetic resonance
   (NMR) spectroscopy, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and
   size exclusion chromatography (SEC). We showed that the only obvious
   backbone chain scission event occurred at the urethane (carbamate)
   linkages. Using the widely applied Arrhenius model for accelerated
   predictions involving chemical reactions, we predict that a 50\%
   reduction in PEU 80A molar mass would require approximately 80 years of
   exposure at 37 degrees C in the presence of excess water. The activation
   energy for urethane linkage hydrolysis of similar to 90 kJ mol(-1)
   extracted from this analysis is in agreement with previous reports,
   where the change in molar mass was accounted for by chain scission
   events at the urethane linkage. A similar analysis of
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) modified urethanes PurSil 35 (P35) and
   ElastEon 2A (E2A), exposed to identical hydrolysis conditions, gave an
   equivalent activation energy for urethane hydrolysis, indicating that
   hydrolytic cleavage of backbone urethane linkages is not significantly
   impacted by the incorporation of PDMS into the urethane structure.
   However, as previously reported, the activation energy governing the
   observed molar mass reduction in these PDMS-urethanes is one-third that
   measured for the hydrolytic chain scission events at the urethane bond.
   These combined results suggest that the reaction(s) responsible for the
   observed molar mass changes in the PDMS-urethanes is not due to
   hydrolytic cleavage at the urethane linkages.}},

Abstract = {{Various tests are used to characterise the strength and resilience of
   granular materials used in the subbase of a pavement system, but there
   is a limited understanding of how particle properties relate to the bulk
   material response under various test conditions. Here, we use discrete
   element method (DEM) simulations with a mechanistically based contact
   model to explore influences of the material properties of the particle
   on the results of two such tests: the dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP)
   and the resilient modulus tests. We find that the measured resilient
   modulus increases linearly with the particle elastic modulus, whereas
   the DCP test results are relatively insensitive to particle elastic
   modulus. The DCP test results are also relatively insensitive to
   inter-particle friction coefficient but strongly dependent on the
   particle shape. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of our modelling
   approach and include suggestions for future improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Solutes such as butyl ether and acetone, which cause unpleasant smells

   dominated by diffusion in the aqueous solution, and behave as expected
   from boundary layer theory. These solutes can also be stripped without
   foaming from latex paints whose viscosities are 20-50 times higher than
   those of aqueous solutions. For the more hydrophobic solutes such as
   butyl ether, the mass transfer coefficients in latex are smaller than
   those in water, as expected from theory. For more hydrophilic solutes
   such as ethanol, the mass transfer coefficients can be as much as 4
   times larger. This unexpected result, inconsistent with conventional
   theory, may result from latex particles serving as a source and can be
   described by coupled diffusion and desorption.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) reactors have complex concentration
   and temperature gradients which make it difficult to understand the
   mechanism of autothermal operation. Previous research in the Schmidt
   group on methane CPO using the capillary sampling technique has shown
   the existence of two zones - oxidation and reforming {[}1-4]. Nearly
   (>90\%) all of the oxygen in the feed is converted within the first 2 mm
   of the catalyst bed. In this paper, temperature and concentration
   profiles during the CPO of methane and dimethyl ether CH3OCH3, an
   oxygenated hydrocarbon, are presented. Results with the two feeds are
   compared and the nature of the profiles was similar, with sharp
   gradients existing in the oxidation zone with slower chemistries in the
   reforming section. The rhodium catalyst in the oxidation zone during
   methane CPO was also analyzed using XPS and XRD and shown to be rhodium
   metal. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Epoxy thermosets were modified with 0-6 wt.\% of

   polymers self-assembled into spherical micelles with PEO coronas and
   either a rubbery PEP or glassy PS core. The influence of the nature of
   the core on modulus, glass transition temperature, T-g, and critical
   strain energy release rate, G(1c), was investigated. As block copolymer
   was added up to 2 wt.\% loading, both block copolymers provided similar
   improvements in G(1c). However, at 2 wt.\% and above, the epoxies
   containing PEP-PEO diblock copolymers outperform those containing PS-PEO
   by approximately a factor of two. In addition, fractography of compact
   tension specimen surfaces revealed distinct features present on the

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL METHODS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{99}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{333-353}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an energy-based measure for the evaluation of the
   local truncation error of two-level one-step integration schemes. The
   measure applies to multiple degree of freedom systems and does not
   necessarily require modal reduction to a scalar model; it naturally
   handles the structural damping and external forcing terms that are
   generally and mistakenly neglected in error analyses, and it segregates
   the error associated with the free and forced response components of the
   problem. To illustrate the approach, two examples associated with the
   application of the trapezoidal scheme and of a high-order scheme
   proposed in the literature are analyzed. The latter reveals the
   shortcomings of the standard approach that is based on the
   undamped/unforced linear oscillator and therefore highlights the need
   for the proposed framework. Indeed, the scheme order of accuracy is
   below expectation when structural damping or external forcing is
   considered, in the numerically dissipative setting. Developments on the
   basis of the time discontinuous Galerkin (TDG) method are then proposed
   to recover the scheme high-order accuracy. Additionally, they show the
   similarity that exists between schemes related to the TDG method and the
   ones obtained by integration by parts of the equation of motion.

Title = {{Revisiting Loop Fusion in the Polyhedral Framework}},
Journal = {{ACM SIGPLAN NOTICES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{233-245}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Loop fusion is an important compiler optimization for improving memory
   hierarchy performance through enabling data reuse. Traditional compilers
   have approached loop fusion in a manner decoupled from other high-level
   loop optimizations, missing several interesting solutions. Recently, the
   polyhedral compiler framework with its ability to compose complex
   transformations, has proved to be promising in performing loop
   optimizations for small programs. However, our experiments with large
   programs using state-of-the-art polyhedral compiler frameworks reveal
   suboptimal fusion partitions in the transformed code. We trace the
   reason for this to be lack of an effective cost model to choose a good
   fusion partitioning among the possible choices, which increase
   exponentially with the number of program statements.
   In this paper, we propose a fusion algorithm to choose good fusion
   partitions with two objective functions - achieving good data reuse and
   preserving parallelism inherent in the source code. These objectives,
   although targeted by previous work in traditional compilers, pose new
   challenges within the polyhedral compiler framework and have thus not
   been addressed. In our algorithm, we propose several heuristics that
   work effectively within the polyhedral compiler framework and allow us
   to achieve the proposed objectives. Experimental results show that our
   fusion algorithm achieves performance comparable to the existing
   polyhedral compilers for small kernel programs, and significantly
   outperforms them for large benchmark programs such as those in the SPEC
   benchmark suite.}},

Abstract = {{Non-determinism in concurrent programs makes their debugging much more
   challenging than that in sequential programs. To mitigate such
   difficulties, we propose a new technique to automatically locate buggy
   shared memory accesses that triggered concurrency bugs. Compared to
   existing fault localization techniques that are based on empirical
   statistical approaches, this technique has two advantages. First, as
   long as enough successful runs of a concurrent program are collected,
   the proposed technique can locate buggy memory accesses to the shared
   data even with only one single failed run captured, as opposed to the
   need of capturing multiple failed runs in other statistical approaches.
   Second, the proposed technique is more precise because it considers
   memory accesses in those failed runs that terminate prematurely.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a notion to be called k-wise uncorrelated
   random variables, which is similar but not identical to the so-called
   k-wise independent random variables in the literature. We show how to
   construct k-wise uncorrelated random variables by a simple procedure.
   The constructed random variables can be applied, e.g., to express the
   quartic polynomial (x(T)Qx)(2), where Q is an n x n positive
   semidefinite matrix, by a sum of fourth powered polynomial terms, known
   as Hilbert's identity. By virtue of the proposed construction, the
   number of required terms is no more than 2n(4) + n. This implies that it
   is possible to find a (2n(4) + n)-point distribution whose fourth
   moments tensor is exactly the symmetrization of Q circle times Q.
   Moreover, we prove that the number of required fourth powered polynomial
   terms to express (x(T)Qx)(2) is at least n(n +1)/2. The result is
   applied to prove that computing the matrix 2 bar right arrow 4 norm is
   NP-hard. Extensions of the results to complex random variables are
   discussed as well.}},

Abstract = {{Random sampling is a simple but powerful method in statistics and in the
   design of randomized algorithms. In a typical application, random
   sampling can be applied to estimate an extreme value, say maximum, of a
   function f over a set S subset of R-n. To do so, one may select a
   simpler (even finite) subset S-0 subset of S, randomly take some samples
   over S-0 for a number of times, and pick the best sample. The hope is to
   find a good approximate solution with reasonable chance. This paper sets
   out to present a number of scenarios for f, S and S-0 where certain
   probability bounds can be established, leading to a quality assurance of
   the procedure. In our setting, f is a multivariate polynomial function.
   We prove that if f is a d-th order homogeneous polynomial in n variables
   and F is its corresponding super-symmetric tensor, and xi(i) (i = 1, 2,
   ..., n) are i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables taking 1 or -1 with equal
   probability, then Prob \{f(xi(1), xi(2), ..., xi(n)) >= tau
   n(-d/2)parallel to F parallel to >= theta, where tau, theta > 0 are two
   universal constants and parallel to . parallel to(1) denotes the
   summation of the absolute values of all its entries. Several new
   inequalities concerning probabilities of the above nature are presented
   in this paper. Moreover, we show that the bounds are tight in most
   cases. Applications of our results in optimization are discussed as
   well.}},

Abstract = {{The time-resolved OH density in a nanosecond pulsed filamentary
   discharge in an atmospheric pressure He-H2O(0.05\%) mixture is measured
   using laser induced fluorescence. The lifetime of the excited OH( A)
   state is found to be strongly time dependent during the plasma pulse,
   with the shortest decay time occurring at the moment the plasma is
   switched off. The measured LIF intensity is corrected for this
   time-resolved quenching and calibrated using Rayleigh scattering.
   Time-resolved electron density (n(e)(max) = (7.6 +/- 0.8) x 10(21)
   m(-3)), He (S-3(1)) metastable density (He-m(max) = (1.6 +/- 0.3) x
   10(20) m(-3)), gas temperature (T-g(max) = ( 350 +/- 60) K) and optical
   emission are presented and used in the interpretation of the observed
   time dependence of the OH density. Based on these experimental data, it
   is shown that for the present discharge conditions, OH is mainly
   produced by charge transfer reactions to water followed by dissociative
   recombination of the water ion. In addition, two often encountered
   issues with the calibration of OH LIF are highlighted with an example.}},

Abstract = {{A transient three-dimensional heat transfer model is developed for a 3
   kW(th) solar thermo-chemical reactor for H2O and CO2 splitting via
   two-step nonstoichiometric ceria cycling. The reactor consists of a

   allow for continuous fuel production and heat recovery. The model is
   developed to solve energy conservation equations accounting for
   conduction, convection, and radiation heat transfer modes, and chemical
   reactions. Radiative heat transfer is analyzed using a combination of
   the Monte Carlo ray-tracing method, the net radiation method, and the
   Rosseland diffusion approximation. Steady-state temperatures, heat
   fluxes, and nonstoichiometry are reported. A temperature swing of up to
   401 K, heat recovery effectiveness of up to 95\%, and solar-to-fuel

Abstract = {{The technical performance of a nontracking hybrid PV/T concept that uses

Abstract = {{Reducing transmission redundancy is key to efficient broadcast in
   wireless networks. A standard approach to achieving this goal is to
   create a network backbone consisting of a subset of nodes that are
   responsible for data forwarding, while other nodes act as passive
   receivers. On top of this, network coding (NC) is often used to further
   reduce unnecessary transmissions. The main problem with existing
   backbone and NC combinations is that the backbone construction process
   is blind of what is needed by NC, thus may produce a structure that
   limits the power of NC algorithms. To address this problem, we propose
   Coding Opportunity Aware Backbone (COAB) metrics, which seek to maximize
   coding opportunities when selecting backbone forwarders. We show that
   the backbone construction process guided by our metrics leads to
   significantly increased coding frequency, at the cost of minimal
   localized information exchange. The highlight of our work is COAB's
   broad applicability and effectiveness. We integrate the COAB metrics
   with ten state-of-the-art broadcast algorithms specified in eight
   publications {[}1]-{[}8], and evaluate COAB with a running testbed of 30
   MICAz nodes and extensively simulations. The experimental results show
   that our design outperforms the existing schemes substantially.}},

Abstract = {{Point-to-point FDD microwave can be a fast-to-install and cost-effective
   backhaul solution for mobile small cells. However, its applications have
   been held back, because the state-of-the-art static backhaul deployment
   fails to capture drastically fluctuating small cell traffic. To address
   this issue we introduce a new adaptive backhaul architecture that is
   able to adapt to changing small cell traffic. Extended from a graph
   theoretic clique idea, the architecture allows changes to the overall
   backhaul topology, and it also allows each individual backhaul link to
   vary its frequency to meet traffic demand. Guard bands are adaptively
   reserved between some of the links to suppress adjacent-frequency
   interference, while being efficiently used by other links for data
   transmission. Our case study of 10 small cells confirms that the
   adaptive architecture is able to increase the small cell throughput by
   75 percent compared to the static backhaul architecture. It can also
   reduce the backhaul bandwidth requirement by 57 percent, and enhance
   small cells' satisfaction by 158.4 percent with respect to their
   allocated bandwidths.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments were performed to study the effect of an
   axial-flow hydrokinetic turbine model on an erodible channel under both
   clear water and live-bed conditions. Clear water experiments were
   performed at two scales with a local bed shear stress just below the
   critical state. Live-bed experiments, performed at small scale, examined
   the interactions between relatively large-scale bedforms and the flow
   induced by an axial flow turbine. Spatiotemporal topographic
   measurements were obtained by sonar and by a state-of-the-art
   high-resolution scanning system integrated into an automated data
   acquisition carriage designed and fabricated at the St. Anthony Falls
   Laboratory at the Univ. of Minnesota. Results indicate that the presence
   of the turbine rotor increases the local shear stress resulting in
   accelerated and expanded scour development when compared with typical
   bridge pier scour mechanisms. The inferred key difference is the
   alteration of the flow patterns in the rotor wake leading to an
   accelerated flow region below the bottom tip. The footprint of the rotor
   is observed in the extension and scaling of the bed surface area
   impacted by the turbine and consistent with the near-wake region.
   Temporally averaged bed topography data from live-bed experiments
   indicate amplified scour depths in the turbine near-wake region as
   compared with the clear water results despite spatial patterns remaining
   qualitatively similar. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Abstract = {{A pedestrian suspension bridge over Walker Creek near Route 749 in Giles
   County, Virginia, partially collapsed in October of 2008, causing 10
   people to fall into the creek below. The failure occurred when one of
   the anchors holding a suspension cable fractured. This paper presents
   the investigation of the failure, including a structural analysis of the
   bridge to determine cable forces, material property testing of the
   fractured anchor, laboratory testing of a different anchor from the
   bridge, and a simple strength evaluation of the anchor under combined
   axial force and moment. Based on the results of the study, it was
   concluded that the anchor should not have failed carrying the loads on
   the bridge on the day of failure. The anchor failed in brittle fracture
   because of a local defect in the material at the perimeter of a
   corrosion pit on the surface of the anchor hook. The structural analysis
   and laboratory testing indicated that the material around the defect was
   at yield before fracture initiation. The material flaws significantly
   influenced the bridge failure after yielding and inelastic deformation
   of the anchor material at the inside of the hook radius occurred. (C)

Abstract = {{The scattering of time-harmonic linear waves by periodic media arises in
   a wide array of applications from materials science and nondestructive
   testing to remote sensing and oceanography. In this work we have in mind
   applications in optics, more specifically plasmonics, and the surface
   plasmon polaritons that are at the heart of remarkable phenomena such as
   extraordinary optical transmission, surface-enhanced Raman scattering,
   and surface plasmon resonance biosensing. In this paper we develop
   robust, highly accurate, and extremely rapid numerical solvers for
   approximating solutions to grating scattering problems in the frequency
   regime where these are commonly used. For piecewise-constant dielectric
   constants, which are commonplace in these applications, surface
   formulations are clearly advantaged as they posit unknowns supported
   solely at the material interfaces. The algorithms we develop here are
   high-order perturbation of surfaces methods and generalize previous
   approaches to take advantage of the fact that these algorithms can be
   significantly accelerated when some or all of the interfaces are trivial
   (flat). More specifically, for configurations with one nontrivial
   interface (and one trivial interface) we describe an algorithm that has
   the same computational complexity as a two-layer solver. With numerical
   simulations and comparisons with experimental data, we demonstrate the
   speed, accuracy, and applicability of our new algorithms. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli) cells were successfully
   encapsulated in reactive membranes comprised of electrospun nanofibers
   that have biocompatible polyvinyl alcohol (PVA)-based cores entrapping
   the E. coli and silica-based, mechanically sturdy porous shells. The
   reactive membranes were produced in a continuous fashion using a coaxial
   electrospinning system coupled to a microfluidic timer that mixed and
   regulated the reaction time of the silica precursor and the PVA solution
   streams. A factorial design method was employed to investigate the
   effects of the three critical design parameters of the system (the flow
   rate of the core solution, protrusion of the core needle, and the
   viscosity of the core solution) and to optimize these parameters for
   reproducibly and continuously producing high-quality core/shell
   nanofibers. The feasibility of using the reactive membranes manufactured
   in this fashion for bioremediation of atrazine, a herbicide, was also
   investigated. The atrazine degradation rate (0.24 mu mol/g of E.
   coli/min) of the encapsulated E. coli cells expressing the
   atrazine-dechlorinating enzyme AtzA was measured to be relatively close
   to that measured with the free cells in solution (0.64 mu mol/g of E.
   coli/min). We show here that the low cost, high flexibility, water
   insolubility, and high degradation efficiency of the bioreactive
   membranes manufactured with electrospinning makes it feasible for their
   wide-spread use in industrial scale bioremediation of contaminated
   waters. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Black ash wetlands are seriously threatened because of the invasive
   emerald ash borer (EAB). Wetland hydrology is likely to be modified
   following ash mortality, but the magnitude of hydrological impact
   following loss via EAB and alternative mitigation harvests is not clear.
   Our objective was to assess the water table response to simulated EAB
   and harvesting to determine if management actions will be needed to
   maintain ecosystem functions following EAB infestation. We applied four
   replicated treatments to 1.6 ha plots as follows: (1) control, (2)
   girdling of all black ash trees to simulate loss via EAB mortality, (3)
   group selection harvests (20\% of stand in 0.04 ha gaps), and (4)
   clear-cut harvest. Water table (WT) elevations were monitored for 1 year
   pre-treatment and two years post-treatment. Clear-cutting delayed WT
   drawdown in both years of the study, and the WT was significantly higher
   than the control treatment, predominantly when WT depth was below 30 cm.
   The effect of the group selection treatment on WT response was muted
   compared to clear-cutting and also limited to periods when the WT depth
   was below 30 cm. These responses were attributed to establishment of
   shallo-wrooted vegetation in cut areas, which would have limited
   influence on WT dynamics as depth increased. There was little effect of
   girdling on the WT in the first year post-treatment, but effects on the
   WT were very similar to clear-cutting in the second year and more
   pronounced when the WT was within 30 cm of the soil surface. These
   effects were attributed to reduced transpiration coupled with the
   presence of a partial canopy following girdling, which would have
   reduced vegetation establishment and evaporation compared to
   clear-cutting. Given the large influence of WT depth on vegetation
   dynamics and associated feedbacks to altered hydrology, these early
   results indicate a greater risk of ecosystem alteration following EAB
   mortality compared to clear-cut harvesting. Depending on local
   hydrologic regime, variation in precipitation patterns, and time for
   complete canopy loss, it may be necessary for managers to implement
   active mitigation strategies (e. g., group selection coupled with
   planting of alternative species) prior to EAB infestation to maintain
   ecosystem processes in these forested wetland systems.}},

Abstract = {{Previous genome-level genetic interaction screens with the single
   essential actin gene of yeast identified 238 nonessential genes that
   upon deletion result in deleterious, digenic complex haploinsufficiences
   with an actin null allele. Deletion alleles of these 238 genes were
   tested for complex heterozygous interactions with 32 actin alanine scan
   alleles, which target clusters of residues on the surface of actin. A
   total of 891 deleterious digenic combinations were identified with 203
   of the 238 genes. Two-dimensional hierarchical cluster analysis of the
   interactions identified nine distinct groups, and the alleles within
   clusters tended to affect localized regions on the surface of actin. The
   mutants in one cluster all affect electrostatic interactions between
   stacked subunits in the long pitch helix of the actin filament. A second
   cluster that contains the most highly interactive alleles may disrupt
   the tropomyosin/myosin system, as one of the mutants in that cluster
   cannot support Type V myosin-dependent movement of secretory vesicles in
   haploids and causes processivity defects in heterozygous diploids. These
   examples suggest the clusters represent mutations with shared
   protein-protein interaction defects. These results show that complex
   heterozygous interaction screens have benefit for detecting
   actin-related genes and suggest that having actin filaments of mixed
   composition, containing both mutant and wild-type subunits, presents
   unique challenges to the cell.}},

Abstract = {{Embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) is considered to be a critical
   building block in future system-on-chip and microprocessor systems.
   Various eNVM technologies have been explored for high-density
   applications including dual-poly embedded flash (eflash), FeRAM,
   STT-MRAM, and RRAM. On the other end of the spectrum, logic-compatible
   eNVM such as e-fuse, anti-fuse, and single-poly eflash memories have
   been considered for moderate-density low-cost applications. In
   particular, single-poly eflash memory has been gaining momentum as it
   can be implemented in a generic logic process while supporting multiple
   program-erase cycles. One key challenge for single-poly eflash is
   enabling bit-by-bit re-write operation without a boosted bitline voltage
   as this could cause disturbance issues in the unselected wordlines. In
   this work, we present details of a bit-by-bit re-writable eflash memory
   implemented in a generic 65 nm logic process which addresses this key
   challenge. The proposed 6 T eflash memory cell can improve the overall
   cell endurance by eliminating redundant program/erase cycles while
   preventing disturbance issues in the unselected wordlines. We also
   provide details of special high voltage circuits such as a
   voltage-doubler based charge pump circuit and a multistory high-voltage
   switch, for generating a reliable high-voltage output without causing
   damage to the standard logic transistors.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation of sand waves in a turbulent open channel flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{753}},
Pages = {{150-216}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We develop a coupled hydro-morphodynamic numerical model for carrying
   out large-eddy simulation of stratified, turbulent flow over a mobile
   sand bed. The method is based on the curvilinear immersed boundary
   approach of Khosronejad et al. (Adv. Water Resour., vol. 34, 2011, pp.
   829-843). We apply this method to simulate sand wave initiation, growth
   and evolution in a mobile bed laboratory open channel, which was studied
   experimentally by Venditti \& Church (J. Geophys. Res., vol. 110, 2005,
   F01009). We show that all the major characteristics of the computed sand
   waves, from the early cross-hatch and chevron patterns to fully grown
   three-dimensional bedforms, are in good agreement with the experimental
   data both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our simulations capture the
   measured temporal evolution of sand wave amplitude, wavelength and
   celerity with good accuracy and also yield three-dimensional topologies
   that are strikingly similar to what was observed in the laboratory. We
   show that near-bed sweeps are responsible for initiating the instability
   of the initially flat sand bed. Stratification effects, which arise due
   to increased concentration of suspended sediment in the flow, also
   become important at later stages of the bed evolution and need to be
   taken into account for accurate simulations. As bedforms grow in
   amplitude and wavelength, they give rise to energetic coherent
   structures in the form of horseshoe vortices, which transport
   low-momentum near-bed fluid and suspended sediment away from the bed,
   giving rise to characteristic `boil' events at the water surface. Flow
   separation off the bedform crestlines is shown to trap sediment in the
   lee side of the crestlines, which, coupled with sediment erosion from
   the accelerating flow over the stoss side, provides the mechanism for
   continuous bedform migration and crestline rearrangement. The
   statistical and spectral properties of the computed sand waves are
   calculated and shown to be similar to what has been observed in nature
   and previous numerical simulations. Furthermore, and in agreement with
   recent experimental findings (Singh et al., Water Resour. Res., vol. 46,
   2010, pp. 1-10), the spectra of the resolved velocity fluctuations above
   the bed exhibit a distinct spectral gap whose width increases with
   distance from the bed. The spectral gap delineates the spectrum of
   turbulence from the low-frequency range associated with very slowly
   evolving, albeit energetic, coherent structures induced by the migrating
   sand waves. Overall the numerical simulations reproduce the laboratory
   observations with good accuracy and elucidate the physical phenomena
   governing the interaction between the turbulent flow and the developing
   mobile bed.}},

Abstract = {{The article presents a new complex variables-based approach for
   analytical evaluation of three-dimensional integrals involved in
   boundary element method (BEM) formulations. The boundary element is
   assumed to be planar and its boundary may contain an arbitrary number of
   straight lines and/or circular arcs. The idea is to use BEM integral
   representations written in a local coordinate system of an element,
   separate in-plane components of the fields involved, arrange them in
   certain complex combinations, and apply integral representations for
   complex functions. These integral representations, such as
   Cauchy-Pompeiu formula (a particular case of Bochner-Martinelli formula)
   are the corollaries of complex forms of Gauss's theorem and Green's
   identity. They reduce the integrals over the area of the domain to those
   over its boundary. The latter integrals can be evaluated analytically
   for various density functions. Analytical expressions are presented for
   basic integrals involved in the single-and double-layer potentials for
   potential (harmonic) and elasticity problems.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework for solving airline revenue management problems
   on large networks, where the main concern is to allocate the flight leg
   capacities to customer requests under fixed class fares. This framework
   is based on a mathematical programming model that decomposes the network
   into origin-destination pairs so that each pair can be treated as a
   single flight-leg problem. We first discuss that the proposed framework
   is quite generic in the sense that not only several well-known models
   from the literature fit into this framework, but also many single
   flight-leg models can be easily extended to a network setting through
   the prescribed construction. Then, we analyze the structure of the
   overall mathematical programming model and establish its relationship
   with other models frequently used in practice. The application of the
   proposed framework is illustrated through two examples based on static
   and dynamic single-leg models, respectively. These illustrative examples
   are then benchmarked against several existing methods on a set of
   real-life network problems.}},

Abstract = {{The design of synthetic circuits for controlling molecular-scale
   processes is an important goal of synthetic biology, with potential
   applications in future in vitro and in vivo biotechnology. In this
   paper, we present a computational approach for designing feedback

   an existing methodology for expressing signal processing and control
   circuits as biomolecular reactions. We first extend the methodology so
   that circuits can be expressed using just two classes of reactions:
   catalysis and annihilation. We then propose implementations of these
   reactions in three distinct classes of nucleic acid circuits, which rely
   on DNA strand displacement, DNA enzyme and RNA enzyme mechanisms,
   respectively. We use these implementations to design a Proportional
   Integral controller, capable of regulating the output of a system
   according to a given reference signal, and discuss the trade-offs
   between the different approaches. As a proof of principle, we implement
   our methodology as an extension to a DNA strand displacement software
   tool, thus allowing a broad range of nucleic acid circuits to be
   designed and analyzed within a common modeling framework.}},

   impurities, including hydrophobic proteins and phytol-type compounds,

Abstract = {{Many real-world processes evolve in cascades over complex networks,
   whose topologies are often unobservable and change over time. However,
   the so-termed adoption times when blogs mention popular news items,
   individuals in a community catch an infectious disease, or consumers
   adopt a trendy electronics product are typically known, and are
   implicitly dependent on the underlying network. To infer the network
   topology, a dynamic structural equation model is adopted to capture the
   relationship between observed adoption times and the unknown edge
   weights. Assuming a slowly time-varying topology and leveraging the
   sparse connectivity inherent to social networks, edge weights are
   estimated by minimizing a sparsity-regularized exponentially-weighted
   least-squares criterion. To this end, solvers with complementary
   strengths are developed by leveraging (pseudo) real-time
   sparsity-promoting proximal gradient iterations, the improved
   convergence rate of accelerated variants, or reduced computational
   complexity of stochastic gradient descent. Numerical tests with both
   synthetic and real data demonstrate the effectiveness of the novel
   algorithms in unveiling sparse dynamically-evolving topologies, while
   accounting for external influences in the adoption times. Key events in
   the political leadership in North Korea and the initial public offering
   of LinkedIn explain connectivity changes observed in the associated
   networks inferred from global cascades of online media.}},

Abstract = {{Higher magnetic field strength in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   systems offers higher signal-to-noise ratio, contrast, and spatial
   resolution in magnetic resonance (MR) images. However, the wavelength in
   ultrahigh fields (7 T and beyond) becomes shorter than the human body at
   the Larmor frequency with increasing static magnetic field (B-0) of the
   MRI system. At short wavelengths, an interference effect appears,
   resulting in nonuniformity of the RF magnetic near-field (B-1) over the
   subject and MR images may have spatially anomalous contrast. The B-1
   near-field generated by the transverse electromagnetic RF coil's
   microstrip line element has a maximum near the center of its length and
   falls off towards both ends. In this study, a double trapezoidal-shaped
   microstrip transmission line element is proposed to obtain uniform B-1
   field distribution by gradual impedance variation. Two multi-channel RF
   head coils with uniform and trapezoidal shape elements were built and
   tested with a phantom at 7-T MRI scanner for comparison. The simulation
   and experimental results show stronger and more uniform B-1(+)
   near-field with the trapezoidal shape.}},

Abstract = {{The most problematic hydrocarbons in hydraulic fracturing ( fracking)
   wastewaters consist of fused, isolated, bridged, and spiro ring systems,
   and ring systems have been poorly studied with respect to
   biodegradation, prompting the testing here of six major ring structural
   subclasses using a well-characterized bacterium and a silica
   encapsulation system previously shown to enhance biodegradation. The
   direct biological oxygenation of spiro ring compounds was demonstrated
   here. These and other hydrocarbon ring compounds have previously been
   shown to be present in flow-back waters and waters produced from
   hydraulic fracturing operations. Pseudomonas sp. strain NCIB 9816-4,
   containing naphthalene dioxygenase, was selected for its broad substrate
   specificity, and it was demonstrated here to oxidize fundamental ring
   structures that are common in shale-derived waters but not previously
   investigated with this or related enzymes. Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4
   was tested here in the presence of a silica encasement, a protocol that
   has previously been shown to protect bacteria against the extremes of
   salinity present in fracking wastewaters. These studies demonstrate the
   degradation of highly hydrophobic compounds by a silica-encapsulated
   model bacterium, demonstrate what it may not degrade, and contribute to
   knowledge of the full range of hydrocarbon ring compounds that can be
   oxidized using Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4.}},

Abstract = {{The 1:1 cocrystal between piroxicam and saccharin exhibits significantly
   deteriorated powder compaction properties compared to both coformers.
   The molecular origin of this effect is revealed by a systematic
   investigation of crystal mechanical properties, probed with
   nanoindentation, and crystal structure analysis. The order of bulk
   powder tabletability of the three materials is identical to that of
   single crystal plasticity (saccharin > piroxicarn > cocrystal). The
   lowest plasticity of the cocrystal is confirmed by its highest crystal
   hardness and the highest yield strength. The low plasticity of the
   cocrystal is attributed to structural packing features that discourage
   plastic deformation. This work demonstrates that cocrystallization, even
   though it may be useful to improve pharmaceutically relevant properties,
   must be carefully evaluated to avoid unexpected problems in formulation
   and drug product manufacturing due to compromised mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Lamivudine (LMV), a cytosine derivative and a reverse transcriptase
   inhibitor, faces the challenge of inefficient purification after its
   chemical synthesis. Currently available methods of purification involve
   salt formation (salicylate or oxalate) followed by treatment with a
   toxic base, triethyl amine (TEA), to neutralize the protonated LMV. Any
   reduction in the use of TEA will make the purification process greener
   and more economical. In this context, we designed and successfully
   isolated a new and elusive 4:1 CAB cocrystal between LMV and oxalic acid
   (OXA) that has the potential to significantly improve the efficiency of
   the LMV purification process. The new CAB cocrystal of LMV was
   efficiently produced by carefully controlling the ratio of LMV to OXA in
   the crystallization medium. Compared to salts currently used for
   purification, much less TEA is required for the 4:1 CAB cocrystal
   (LMV/LMVH+/OXA(2-) at 2:2:1 mole ratio) because only half of the LMV is
   protonated that requires TEA treatment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new nearest neighbor (NN) retrieval framework:
   robust sparse hashing (RSH). Our approach is inspired by the success of
   dictionary learning for sparse coding. Our key idea is to sparse code
   the data using a learned dictionary, and then to generate hash codes out
   of these sparse codes for accurate and fast NN retrieval. But, direct
   application of sparse coding to NN retrieval poses a technical
   difficulty: when data are noisy or uncertain (which is the case with
   most real-world data sets), for a query point, an exact match of the
   hash code generated from the sparse code seldom happens, thereby
   breaking the NN retrieval. Borrowing ideas from robust optimization
   theory, we circumvent this difficulty via our novel robust dictionary
   learning and sparse coding framework called RSH, by learning
   dictionaries on the robustified counterparts of the perturbed data
   points. The algorithm is applied to NN retrieval on both simulated and
   real-world data. Our results demonstrate that RSH holds significant
   promise for efficient NN retrieval against the state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{In a densely deployed heterogeneous network (HetNet), the number of
   pico/micro base stations (BS) can be comparable with the number of the

   identification of the set of serving BSs becomes an important design
   issue. In this work, we show that by jointly optimizing the transceivers
   and determining the active set of BSs, high system resource utilization
   can be achieved with only a small number of BSs. In particular, we
   provide formulations and efficient algorithms for such joint
   optimization problem, under the following two common design criteria: i)
   minimization of the total power consumption at the BSs, and ii)
   maximization of the system spectrum efficiency. In both cases, we
   introduce a nonsmooth regularizer to facilitate the activation of the
   most appropriate BSs. We illustrate the efficiency and the efficacy of
   the proposed algorithms via extensive numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines three sets of approximate formulae for the overall
   tetragonal effective elastic properties of two-phase fiber-reinforced
   unidirectional composites with isotropic phases. The fibers are of
   circular cross-sections and periodically distributed in a matrix in a
   square pattern. The formulae by Kantor and Bergman, Luciano and Barbero,
   and estimates based on non-interacting Maxwell's type approximations are
   rewritten in unified notations. The latter approximations coincide with
   the most of well-known estimates of the effective medium theories
   (composite cylinder model, generalized self-consistent model and the
   Mori-Tanaka method), as well as with one of the Hashin-Shtrikman
   variational bounds. The approximate estimates are compared with the
   exact periodic solutions to determine the range of their applicability.
   The simplest and most accurate formulae are identified and suggested as
   a set of approximate expressions for accurate estimates of the effective
   elastic properties of composite materials with a square symmetry.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. An increasing number of deaf individuals are being implanted
   with central auditory prostheses, but their performance has generally
   been poorer than for cochlear implant users. The goal of this study is
   to investigate stimulation strategies for improving hearing performance
   with a new auditory midbrain implant (AMI). Previous studies have shown
   that repeated electrical stimulation of a single site in each
   isofrequency lamina of the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus
   (ICC) causes strong suppressive effects in elicited responses within the
   primary auditory cortex (A1). Here we investigate if improved cortical
   activity can be achieved by co-activating neurons with different timing
   and locations across an ICC lamina and if this cortical activity varies
   across A1. Approach. We electrically stimulated two sites at different
   locations across an isofrequency ICC lamina using varying delays in
   ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs. We recorded and analyzed spike
   activity and local field potentials across different layers and
   locations of A1. Results. Co-activating two sites within an isofrequency
   lamina with short inter-pulse intervals (<5ms) could elicit cortical
   activity that is enhanced beyond a linear summation of activity elicited
   by the individual sites. A significantly greater extent of normalized
   cortical activity was observed for stimulation of the rostral-lateral
   region of an ICC lamina compared to the caudal-medial region. We did not
   identify any location trends across A1, but the most cortical
   enhancement was observed in supragranular layers, suggesting further
   integration of the stimuli through the cortical layers. Significance.
   The topographic organization identified by this study provides further
   evidence for the presence of functional zones across an ICC lamina with
   locations consistent with those identified by previous studies.
   Clinically, these results suggest that co-activating different neural
   populations in the rostral-lateral ICC rather than the caudal-medial ICC
   using the AMI may improve or elicit different types of hearing
   capabilities.}},

Abstract = {{Granules prepared by the high shear wet granulation (HSWG) process
   commonly exhibit the problem of overgranulation, a phenomenon
   characterized by a severe loss of the ability to form adequately strong
   tablet. We hypothesize that the incorporation of brittle excipients
   promotes brittle fracture of granules during compaction, thereby
   improving tablet mechanical strength by increasing bonding area. On this
   basis, we have examined the effectiveness of incorporating a brittle
   excipient into a plastic matrix in addressing the overgranulation
   problem. A complete loss of tabletability is observed for plastic
   microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) when 55\% of granulating water was
   used. The incorporation of a brittle excipient, either lactose or
   dibasic calcium phosphate (Dical) into the MCC matrix leads to improved
   tabletability in a concentration-dependent manner, with higher amount of
   brittle excipient being more effective. For each mixture, tablet tensile
   strength goes through a minimum as the granulating water increases, for
   example, 1.4 MPa for the mixture containing 80\% of lactose and 2.1 MPa
   for the mixture containing 80\% Dical. These results, along with
   scanning electron microscope evidence, show that the addition of brittle
   excipients to an otherwise plastic powder is an effective formulation
   strategy to address the overgranulation problem in HSWG. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{Recent advances in Inter-Vehicle Communications (IVC) and
   Vehicle-Infrastructure Integration (VII) paved ways to real-time
   information sharing among vehicles, which are beneficial for vehicle
   energy management strategies (EMS). This is especially valuable for
   power-split hybrid electrical vehicles (HEV) in order to determine the
   optimal power-split between two different power sources at any
   particular time. Certainly, researches in this area have been done, but
   tradeoffs between optimality, driving-cycle sensitivity, speed of
   calculation and charge-sustaining (CS) conditions have not been
   cohesively addressed before. In light of this, a combined approach of a
   time-efficient powertrain optimization strategy, utilizing trajectory
   prediction based on IVC and VII is proposed. First, Gipps' car following
   model for traffic prediction is used to predict the interactions between
   vehicles, combined with the cell-transmission-model (CTM) for the
   leading vehicle trajectory prediction. Secondly, a computationally
   efficient charge-sustaining (CS) HEV powertrain optimization strategy is
   analytically derived and simulated, based on the Pontryagin's Minimum
   Principle and a CS-condition constraint. A 3D lookup-map, generated
   offline to interpolate the optimizing parameters based on the predicted
   speed, is also utilized to speed up the calculations. Simulations are
   conducted for 6-mile and 15-mile cases with different prediction update
   timings to test the performance of the proposed strategy against a
   Rule-Based (RB) control strategy. Results for accurate-prediction cases
   show 9.6\% average fuel economy improvements in miles-per-gallon (MPG)
   over RB for the 6-mile case and 7\% improvements for the 15-mile case.
   Prediction-with-error cases show smaller average MPG's improvements,
   with 1.6\% to 4.3\% improvements for the 6-mile case and 2.6\% to 3.4\%
   improvements for the 15-mile case. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   skin burns}},
Journal = {{BURNS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{40}},

Abstract = {{Classification of thermal injury is typically accomplished either
   through the use of an equivalent dosimetry method (equivalent minutes at
   43 degrees C, CEM43 degrees C) or through a thermal-injury-damage metric
   (the Arrhenius method). For lower-temperature levels, the equivalent
   dosimetry approach is typically employed while higher-temperature
   applications are most often categorized by injury-damage calculations.
   The two methods derive from common thermodynamic/physical chemistry
   origins. To facilitate the development of the interrelationships between
   the two metrics, application is made to the case of skin burns. This
   thermal insult has been quantified by numerical simulation, and the
   extracted time-temperature results served for the evaluation of the
   respective characterizations. The simulations were performed for
   skin-surface exposure temperatures ranging from 60 to 90 degrees C,
   where each surface temperature was held constant for durations extending
   from 10 to 110 s. It was demonstrated that values of CEM43 at the basal
   layer of the skin were highly correlated with the depth of injury
   calculated from a thermal injury integral. Local values of CEM43 were
   connected to the local cell survival rate, and a correlating equation
   was developed relating CEM43 with the decrease in cell survival from
   90\% to 10\%. Finally, it was shown that the cell survival/CEM43
   relationship for the cases investigated here most closely aligns with
   isothermal exposure of tissue to temperatures of similar to 50 degrees

Abstract = {{The potential of algae-based biofuels to replace petroleum fuels and
   mitigate greenhouse gas production through microalgal photosynthesis has
   long been recognized. However, currently there are no commercial
   algae-to-fuels technologies that can overcome techno-economic barriers

   cultivation with wastewater treatment is considered as one of the most
   promising routes to produce bio-energy and bio-based byproducts in an
   economically viable and environmentally friendly way. This paper
   critically reviews the current status of this specific niche research
   area covering utilization of different types of wastewaters as media for
   algae cultivation, microalgae selection, bioreactor type, cultivation
   mode, environmental factors and operational parameters as well as
   harvesting techniques and production of a broad spectrum of biofuels and
   byproducts through various conversion pathways. Future development of
   practical solutions to key problems and integration of advanced algae
   cultivation and wastewater treatment, and system analysis approach to
   the evaluation of economic feasibility and sustainability of

Abstract = {{Fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis (fMAP) in the presence of a microwave

   ratio were analyzed. For Chlorella sp., a temperature of 550 degrees C,
   with no catalyst were the optimal conditions, resulting in a maximum
   bio-oil yield of 57 wt.\%. For Nannochloropsis, a temperature of 500
   degrees C, with 0.5 of catalyst ratio were shown to be the optimal
   condition, resulting in a maximum bio-oil yield of 59 wt.\%. These
   results show that the use of microwave absorbents in fMAP increased

Abstract = {{Stochasticity in the dynamics of small reacting systems requires
   discrete-probabilistic models of reaction kinetics instead of
   traditional continuous-deterministic ones. The master probability
   equation is a complete model of randomly evolving molecular populations.
   Because of its ambitious character, the master equation remained
   unsolved for all but the simplest of molecular interaction networks.
   With the first solution of chemical master equations (CMEs), a wide
   range of experimental observations of small-system interactions may be
   mathematically conceptualized.}},

Abstract = {{First-principles calculations suggest that doping TiO2 with carbonate
   can effectively reduce the bandgap of TiO2, thus making TiO2 photoactive
   in the visible region of the solar spectrum. Herein we report a simple
   ``one-pot{''} solvothermal method for synthesizing brown carbonate-doped
   TiO2 microspheres. The diameter of the TiO2 microsphere is tunable from
   similar to 0.5 to 4 mu m with the nanopore size in the range of 3-11 nm.
   Remarkably, the specific surface area of these nanoporous anatase TiO2
   rnicrospheres can be as high as 500 m(2) g(-1). A controllable amount of
   carbonate could be incorporated into TiO2 through low-temperature
   post-synthesis annealing, which extends the light absorption of the TiO2
   microspheres from the ultraviolet to the visible region of the solar
   spectrum. Very high photocatalytic activity of these carbonate-doped
   TiO2 microspheres was demonstrated in the visible light region for both
   photocatalytic production of hydrogen from water and degradation of
   methyl orange. Under 3 Sun visible-light illumination (lambda >= 400
   nm), the carbonate-doped TiO2 microspheres can produce 0.2 mmol H-2
   h(-1) g(-1) of photocatalyst, which is significantly higher than those
   from various other TiO2 photocatalysts.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ELASTICITY}},

Pages = {{189-206}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In the original derivation due to Dougall (Proc. Edinb. Math. Soc.
   16(1):82-98, {[}22]), the center of dilation is constructed from the
   superposition of orthogonal force dipoles. However, it can also be built
   by combining dislocation dipoles. While the two representations are
   equivalent in elasticity, the different nature of the force and
   dislocation dipoles leads to different transient behaviors in
   poroelasticity, when the response evolves from undrained to drained.
   Indeed, we show that the poroelastic solution of a center of dilation is
   obtained by superposing the corresponding elastic solution and either an
   instantaneous fluid sink or an instantaneous fluid source, depending on
   whether the center of dilation is treated as a singular stress or
   displacement discontinuity. A simple explanation to the instantaneous
   injection or withdrawal of a finite volume of fluid from/to the
   singularity is given by adopting an exploded view of the poroelastic
   center of dilation. The exploration of the drained, undrained and
   transient responses of this singularity also requires to clarify the
   close relationship between an instantaneous fluid source and a
   continuous fluid dodecapole, an object constructed by collapsing onto a
   point three orthogonal pairs of fluid dipoles.}},

   objective of the study is to determine quadrature strategies, which
   enjoy the same accuracy and stability behavior as full Gauss quadrature,
   but with significantly fewer quadrature points. Several cases emerge
   that satisfy this objective and also demonstrate superior efficiency

Title = {{Porous particulate film deposition in the transition regime}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{42-51}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{We examine the formation of particulate films via Langevin dynamic
   simulations of monodisperse particle deposition onto flat substrates. In
   simulations, we consider particle inertia, thermal motion, and a
   constant advective force directing particles towards the substrate.
   These conditions effectively mimic the formation of dust cakes during
   filtration, as well as the production of nanostructured films at the
   outlet of gas phase synthesis reactors. Parameterization of the
   equations of motion shows that the movement of each particle depends
   only upon Kn(D) (the diffusive Knudsen number, proportional to the
   particle's mean persistence distance to its radius) and chi(F) (the
   ratio of the particle's translational energy at the advective velocity
   to the thermal energy). Use of these ratios is advantageous because one
   dimensionless number (Kn(D)) is independent of the advective velocity,
   while the second (chi(F)) is independent of background gas pressure.
   This is in contrast with the traditionally employed Peclet and Stokes
   numbers, both of which are dependent upon the advective velocity and gas
   pressure. The film structures resulting from simulations are quantified
   in terms of their porosities, and results are reported for simulations
   over a wide range of Kn(D) (10(-3)-10(1)) and chi(F) (10(-4)-10(3)),
   deposition areas 1000 x 1000 particle radii in size, and with more than
   10(6) deposited particles. For each simulated deposit, three distinct
   regions are observed: (I) a region close to the substrate (within 50
   primary particle radii), wherein the porosity begins at a minimum and
   increases to constant value; (II) a region where this constant porosity
   is maintained (which is dependent on Kn(D) and chi(F)), constantly
   increasing in height and encompassing the majority of the film after
   sufficient deposition; and (III) the outer region, in which the film is
   still growing, and the porosity increases from the region II value to
   unity, spanning less than 100 particle radii in height in most
   circumstances. A regression equation is provided to describe the film
   porosity as a function of Kn(D) and chi(F) in region II, facilitating a
   priori predictions of film porosities from deposition parameters. (C)

   diesel injection to control ignition. Alternative fuels like hydrogen
   and ethanol have been used as fumigants in the past but typically with
   diesel injection systems that did not allow the same degree of control
   or mixing enabled by modern common rail systems. In this work, we
   experimentally investigated hydrogen, ethanol, and gasoline as fumigants
   and examined three levels of fumigant energy fraction (FEF) using
   gasoline over a large, direct diesel injection timing range with a
   single-cylinder diesel engine. It was found that the operable diesel
   injection timing range at constant FEF was dependent on the fumigant's
   propensity for autoignition. Peak indicated gross cycle efficiency
   occurred with advanced diesel injection timing and aligned well with
   combustion phasing near top dead center (TDC), as we found in an earlier
   work. The use of hydrogen as a fumigant resulted in very low hydrocarbon
   (HC) emissions compared with ethanol and gasoline, establishing that
   they mainly result from incomplete combustion of the fumigated fuel.
   Hydrogen emissions were independent of diesel injection timing, and HC
   emissions were strongly linked to combustion phasing, giving further
   indication that squish and crevice flows are responsible for partially
   burned species from fumigation combustion.}},

Abstract = {{Degeneration alters the biochemical composition of the disc, affecting
   the mechanical integrity leading to spinal instability. Quantitative
   T2{*} MRI probes water mobility within the macromolecular network, a
   potentially more sensitive assessment of disc health. We determined the
   relationship between T2{*} relaxation time and proteoglycan content,
   collagen content, and compressive mechanics throughout the degenerative
   spectrum. Eighteen human cadaveric lumbar (L4-L5) discs were imaged
   using T2{*} MRI. The T2{*} relaxation time at five locations (nucleous
   pulposus or NP, anterior annulus fibrosis or AF, posterior AF, inner AF,
   and outer AF) was correlated with sulfated-glycosaminoglycan (s-GAG)
   content, hydroxyproline content, and residual stress and strain at each
   location. T2{*} relaxation times were significantly correlated with
   s-GAG contents in all test locations and were particularly strong in the
   NP (r = 0.944; p < 0.001) and inner AF (r = 0.782; p < 0.001). T2{*}
   relaxation times were also significantly correlated with both residual
   stresses and excised strains in the NP (r = 0.857; p < 0.001: r = 0.816;
   p < 0.001), inner AF (r = 0.535; p = 0.022: r = 0.516; p = 0.028), and
   outer AF (r = 0.668; p = 0.002: r = 0.458; p = 0.041). These strong
   correlations highlight T2{*} MRI's ability to predict the biochemical
   and mechanical health of the disc. T2{*} MRI assessment of disc health
   is a clinically viable tool showing promise as a biomarker for
   distinguishing degenerative changes. (C) 2014 Orthopaedic Research

Abstract = {{A complex unsteady-state two-phase kinetic model including reaction
   kinetics and fluid dynamics was developed for corn stover fluidized bed
   steam gasification process. The gasification model included an unreacted
   core shrinking model for char-gas reactions, and a pyrolysis model
   considering the effect of the particle size on the pyrolysis time and
   pyrolysis products. In this model, fuel particles stay in the fluidized
   bed and take part in chemical reactions until their size decreases to a
   critical size, and then are entrained out of the bed. The kinetic model
   developed in this study is capable of predicting concentration profiles
   of gas in the bubble phase and the emulsion phase along the height of
   the reactor, the evolution of particles in the bed with time, and the
   particle size distribution in the fluidized bed under different
   operating conditions (temperature, steam/biomass ratio, and gas
   superficial velocity). Results show that the water-gas shift reaction
   and the residence time play important roles in determining the
   gasification results in terms of the gas volumetric fraction and yields
   of char and dry tar-free gas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Number = {{SI}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Radiative properties of spherical heterogeneous particles consisting of
   three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) cerium dioxide (ceria)
   are numerically predicted in the spectral range 290-10,000 nm. The
   particles are 1000 nm in diameter, with interconnected pores of 330-nm
   diameter and a face-centered cubic lattice arrangement. Predictions are
   obtained by solving macroscopic Maxwell's equations using the discrete
   dipole approximation and the finite element method. The scattering and
   absorption efficiency factors as well as the asymmetry factor are
   determined as a function of the particle orientation relative to the
   direction of the incident plane wave. The scattering and absorption
   efficiency factors show significant dependence on the particle
   orientation in the spectral range 560-1000 nm. Compared to homogeneous
   ceria particles, 3DOM particles of the same diameter have a
   significantly reduced extinction efficiency for wavelengths greater than
   560 nm. Approximating the 3DOM particles as a homogeneous sphere with
   properties calculated from an effective medium theory is also
   considered. This approach is shown to be valid only for wavelengths much
   greater than the pore size, which demonstrates that a detailed
   geometrical representation of the internal particle structure is
   essential to obtain accurate radiative characteristics of highly ordered
   nano-structured particles. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{MECHANISM AND MACHINE THEORY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{78}},
Pages = {{81-91}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The switch-mode continuously variable transmission is the mechanical
   analog of a DC-DC boost converter circuit and allows coupling a high
   speed flywheel to a mechanical load. The system requires a
   high-frequency clutch with a variable duty ratio and low slip during
   engagement and disengagement. In this paper, the synthesis and baseline
   testing of a novel digital clutch for this application are presented.
   The custom clutch design utilizes a double dwell axial cam with a
   profile that varies with radius. The duty cycle of the clutch is
   controlled through positioning the radial location of three translating
   followers, connected through a linkage. The axial clamping force of the
   clutch is generated through designed deflection of the system components
   and springs in series with the cam followers. Through baseline testing,
   the clutch was operated at angular velocities up to 45 rad/s, creating
   clutch switching frequencies up to 22 Hz. The average clutch efficiency
   at 20\% duty cycle was 55\%, yet the efficiency is highly dependent on
   the duty cycle and can be improved in future testing. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The free piston engine (FPE), as an alternative of the conventional
   internal combustion engine, could significantly impact the energy
   consumption and emissions of both on-highway and off-highway vehicles.
   In an FPE, the piston motion is dependent on the combustion chamber gas
   dynamics and the loading dynamics in real time. One of the technical
   barriers that prevents the wide spread of this technology is the lack of
   precise piston motion control. In this paper, we present the modeling
   and control of a hydraulic FPE with an opposed-piston opposed-cylinder
   design. Specifically, a comprehensive system model is first built and
   validated to study the dynamics of the engine operation. The simulation
   studies lead to the design of an active piston motion controller, which
   acts as a virtual crankshaft by utilizing energy in the storage element
   to regulate the piston to follow a predefined trajectory. With a
   designated optimal trajectory, the virtual crankshaft ensures stable and
   robust operation in engine motoring. Preliminary combustion testing
   results and analysis are also included in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a single-stage bidirectional high-frequency

   adjustable magnitude and frequency PWM ac drive. This type of converters
   find a wide range of applications including UPS systems, drives

   storage systems (typically low voltage dc to high voltage PWM ac). The
   HFT results in reduction in cost and weight along with a considerable
   increase in power density. The adverse effects of common-mode voltage
   are well known in this kind of applications. The proposed topology along
   with a modulation technique reduces common-mode voltage to practically
   zero and generates high-quality output voltage waveform comparable to
   conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM). A source-based commutation
   method, presented in this paper, to commute the energy stored in the
   leakage inductance of the HFT resulting in the following advantages 1)
   no need for any auxiliary circuits with passive components; 2) almost
   complete recovery of the leakage energy; 3) soft switching of the output

Abstract = {{This paper reports the effects of surfactant Bi atomic diffusion on the
   microstructure evolution and resulted property manipulation in FePt
   spintronic films by the quantitative studies of X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy and positron annihilation spectroscopy. The defect density
   in the FePt layer, which was tunable by varying the thermal treatment
   temperatures, was found to be remarkably enhanced correlated with the Bi
   atomic diffusion behavior. The observed defect density evolution
   substantially favors Fe(Pt) atomic migrations and lowers the energy
   barrier for atomic ordering transition, resulting in a great improvement
   of hard magnet property of the films. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A number of recent mechanical property studies have sought to validate
   atomistic and multiscale models with matching experimental volumes. One
   such property is the ductile-brittle transition temperature (DBTT).
   Currently no model exists that incorporates both external and internal
   variables in an analytical model to address both length scales and
   environment. Using thermally activated parameters for dislocation
   plasticity, the present study attempts a small piece of this. With
   activation energy and activation volumes previously determined for
   single and polycrystalline Fe-3\% Si, predictions of DBTT both with and
   without atmospheric hydrogen are made. These are compared with standard
   fracture toughness measurements similarly for samples both with and
   without atmospheric hydrogen. In the hydrogen-free samples, average
   strain rate varied by four orders of magnitude. DBTT shifts are
   experimentally found and predicted to increase 100 K or more with either
   increasing strain rate or exposure to hydrogen.}},

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{The Maxwell relation, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, and a
   non-iterative method to obtain the critical exponents have been used to
   characterize the magnetocaloric effect (MCE) and the nature of the phase
   transitions in Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3, which undergoes a second-order
   paramagnetic to ferromagnetic (PM-FM) transition at T-C similar to 247
   K, and a first-order ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic (FM-AFM)
   transition at T-N similar to 165 K. We find that around the second-order
   PM-FM transition, the MCE (as represented by the magnetic entropy
   change, Delta S-M) can be precisely determined from magnetization
   measurements using the Maxwell relation. However, around the first-order
   FM-AFM transition, values of Delta S-M calculated with the Maxwell
   relation deviate significantly from those calculated by the
   Clausius-Clapeyron equation at the magnetic field and temperature ranges
   where a conversion between the AFM and FM phases occurs. A detailed
   analysis of the critical exponents of the second-order PM-FM transition
   allows us to correlate the short-range type magnetic interactions with
   the MCE. Using the Arrott-Noakes equation of state with the appropriate
   values of the critical exponents, the field-and temperature-dependent
   magnetization M(T, H) curves, and hence the Delta S-M(T, H) curves, have
   been simulated and compared with experimental data. A good agreement
   between the experimental and simulated data has been found in the
   vicinity of the Curie temperature T-C, but a noticeable discrepancy is
   present for T<<T-C. This discrepancy arises mainly from the coexistence
   of AFM and FM phases and the presence of ferromagnetic clusters in the
   AFM matrix.}},

Abstract = {{We have observed the eigenmodes of coupled transverse domain walls in a
   pair of ferromagnetic nanowires. Although the pair is coupled
   magnetostatically, its spectrum is determined by a combination of
   pinning by edge roughness and dipolar coupling of the two walls. Because
   the corresponding energy scales are comparable, the coupling can be
   observed only at the smallest wire separations. A model of the coupled
   wall dynamics reproduces the experiment quantitatively, allowing for
   comparisons with the estimated pinning and domain wall coupling
   energies. The results have significant implications for the dynamics of

Abstract = {{Deciphering the origin of seismic velocity heterogeneities in the mantle
   is crucial to understanding internal structures and processes at work in
   the Earth. The spin crossover in iron in ferropericlase (Fp), the second
   most abundant phase in the lower mantle, introduces unfamiliar effects
   on seismic velocities. First-principles calculations indicate that
   anticorrelation between shear velocity (V-S) and bulk sound velocity
   (V-phi) in the mantle, usually interpreted as compositional
   heterogeneity, can also be produced in homogeneous aggregates containing
   Fp. The spin crossover also suppresses thermally induced heterogeneity
   in longitudinal velocity (V-P) at certain depths but not in VS. This
   effect is observed in tomography models at conditions where the spin
   crossover in Fp is expected in the lower mantle. In addition, the
   one-of-a-kind signature of this spin crossover in the R-S/P (partial
   derivative ln V-S= partial derivative ln V-P) heterogeneity ratio might
   be a useful fingerprint to detect the presence of Fp in the lower
   mantle.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Giant magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensors have emerged as powerful tools
   for ultrasensitive, multiplexed, real-time electrical readout, and rapid
   biological/chemical detection while combining with magnetic particles.
   Finding appropriate magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and its influences on
   the detection signal is a vital aspect to the GMR bio-sensing
   technology. Here, we report a GMR sensor based detection system capable
   of stable and convenient connection, and real-time measurement. Five
   different types of MNPs with sizes ranging from 10 to 100 nm were
   investigated for GMR biosensing. The experiments were accomplished with
   the aid of DNA hybridization and detection architecture on GMR sensor
   surface. We found that different MNPs markedly affected the final
   detection signal, depending on their characteristics of magnetic moment,
   size, and surface-based binding ability, etc. This work may provide a
   useful guidance in selecting or preparing MNPs to enhance the
   sensitivity ofGMRbiosensors, and eventually lead to a versatile and
   portable device for molecular diagnostics.}},

Pages = {{3861-3868}},
Month = {{JUL 17}},
Abstract = {{Kcnq1, which encodes for the pore-forming alpha-subunit of a
   voltage-gated potassium channel, was identified as a gastrointestinal
   (GI) tract cancer susceptibility gene in multiple Sleeping Beauty DNA
   transposon-based forward genetic screens in mice. To confirm that Kcnq1
   has a functional role in GI tract cancer, we created Apc(Min) mice that
   carried a targeted deletion mutation in Kcnq1. Results demonstrated that
   Kcnq1 is a tumor suppressor gene as Kcnq1 mutant mice developed
   significantly more intestinal tumors, especially in the proximal small
   intestine and colon, and some of these tumors progressed to become
   aggressive adenocarcinomas. Gross tissue abnormalities were also
   observed in the rectum, pancreas and stomach. Colon organoid formation
   was significantly increased in organoids created from Kcnq1 mutant mice
   compared with wild-type littermate controls, suggesting a role for Kcnq1
   in the regulation of the intestinal crypt stem cell compartment. To
   identify gene expression changes due to loss of Kcnq1, we carried out
   microarray studies in the colon and proximal small intestine. We
   identified altered genes involved in innate immune responses, goblet and
   Paneth cell function, ion channels, intestinal stem cells, epidermal
   growth factor receptor and other growth regulatory signaling pathways.
   We also found genes implicated in inflammation and in cellular
   detoxification. Pathway analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and
   Gene Set Enrichment Analysis confirmed the importance of these gene
   clusters and further identified significant overlap with genes regulated
   by MUC2 and CFTR, two important regulators of intestinal homeostasis. To
   investigate the role of KCNQ1 in human colorectal cancer (CRC), we
   measured protein levels of KCNQ1 by immunohistochemistry in tissue
   microarrays containing samples from CRC patients with liver metastases
   who had undergone hepatic resection. Results showed that low expression
   of KCNQ1 expression was significantly associated with poor overall
   survival.}},

Title = {{alpha-Synuclein-Induced Membrane Remodeling Is Driven by Binding
   Affinity, Partition Depth, and Interleaflet Order Asymmetry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{136}},
Number = {{28}},
Pages = {{9962-9972}},
Month = {{JUL 16}},
Abstract = {{We have investigated the membrane remodeling capacity of the N-terminal
   membrane-binding domain of a-synuclein (alpha-Syn(100)). Using
   fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and vesicle clearance assays, we
   show that alpha-Syn(100) fully tubulates POPG vesicles, the first
   demonstration that the amphipathic helix on its own is capable of this
   effect. We also show that at equal density of membrane-bound protein,
   alpha-Syn has dramatically reduced affinity for, and does not tubulate,
   vesicles composed of a 1:1 POPG:POPC mixture. Coarse-grained molecular
   dynamics simulations suggested that the difference between the pure POPG
   and mixture results may be attributed to differences in the protein's
   partition depth, the membrane's hydrophobic thickness, and disruption of
   acyl chain order. To explore the importance of these attributes compared
   with the role of the reduced binding energy, we created an
   alpha-Syn(100) variant in which we removed the hydrophobic core of the
   non-amyloid component (NAC) domain and tested its impact on pure POPG
   vesicles. We observed a substantial reduction in binding affinity and
   tubulation, and simulations of the NAC-null protein suggested that the
   reduced binding energy increases the protein mobility on the bilayer
   surface, likely impacting the protein's ability to assemble into
   organized pretubule structures. We also used simulations to explore a
   potential role for interleaflet coupling as an additional driving force
   for tubulation. We conclude that symmetry across the leaflets in the
   tubulated state maximizes the interaction energy of the two leaflets and
   relieves the strain induced by the hydrophobic void beneath the
   amphipathic helix.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) homopolymer ``shuttle{''}

   transferred reversibly and quantitatively between water at room

   temperature of the transfer from water to {[}EMIM]{[}TFSI] shows a
   linear dependence on PEO molecular weight and a dependence on polymer

   These results are also consistent with the previously observed lower
   critical solution temperature (LCST) behavior of PEO in water. Dynamic
   light scattering study of the concentration and temperature dependence
   of the swelling degree of PEO corona of polybutadiene (PB)-PEO block

Journal = {{MARINE POLLUTION BULLETIN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{84}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{155-163}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{The dispersion effectiveness of dispersants containing Tween 80, Span
   80, and dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DOSS) was characterized using a
   modified Swirling Flask test, and was correlated with both initial and
   dynamic interfacial tension produced by those dispersants at an
   oil-water interface. Compositional trends in effectiveness were shown to
   be governed by: (1) initial oil-water interfacial tension observed upon
   dispersant-oil-saltwater contact; (2) rate of increase (or decrease)
   from the initial interfacial tension as DOSS was rapidly lost to the
   aqueous phase; and (3) gradually slowing kinetics of dispersant
   adsorption to the oil-water interface as Span 80 concentration was
   increased, which ultimately diminished dispersion effectiveness
   considerably even as dynamic interfacial tension remained <10(-3) mN/m.
   It is proposed that this third phenomenon results not only from the
   hydrophobicity of Span 80, but also from the dependence of mixed
   Tween-Span-DOSS reverse micelles' stability in crude oil on dispersant
   composition. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Steam stability of MCM-22 and its all siliceous analogue, ITQ-1, with
   MWW structure was investigated in a mixture of water vapor and nitrogen
   (95 mol\% H2O, 5 mol\% N-2) at 10 barg pressure and two different
   temperatures of 600 degrees C and 350 degrees C for a period of 84 days.
   Further, the effect of calcination temperature and silicon tetrachloride
   (SiCl4) treatment on the steam stability of ITQ-1 was studied. Behavior
   of these zeolites was monitored in 21-day intervals using XRD, SEM, TEM,
   Si-29 solid-state NMR, nitrogen and argon adsorption analyses. It was
   found that structural defects adversely affected the steam stability of
   the zeolites but SiCl4 treatment was effective to enhance the zeolite
   resistance to water vapor attack. It was observed that long-term
   steaming can generate holes in the crystals along with some
   amorphization; however, it also generated highly homogeneous short range
   order in the crystals. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this investigation is to develop and implement a numerical
   simulation model to predict the outcome of the thermochemical ablation
   therapy of tumors and other dysfunctional tissue. The simulation model
   formulated here includes a reaction zone whose volume is defined by the
   volume of the chemical reagents and a surrounding volume of tissue to be
   necrosed. Account is taken of the relevant macroscopic thermal processes
   of conduction, perfusion, metabolism, and internal energy
   storage/depletion. The zone of necrosed tissue is quantified by means of
   the Henriques-Moritz thermal damage integral. The simulation model was
   confirmed by comparisons with available experimental data. The main
   results extracted from the simulations are the temporal and spatial
   temperature variations throughout the tissue bed and the resulting
   distributions of necrosed and non-necrosed tissue. The radius of the
   zone of necrosis was algebraically correlated with the heat of reaction
   of the participating reagents. It was demonstrated that through the
   selection of appropriate conditions, sufficient thermal energy can be
   released to ablate significant volumes of tissue. The duration of the
   treatment required to achieve a pre-selected zone of necrosed tissue can
   also be predicted.}},

Abstract = {{A hot-melt pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) was generated containing a
   high content of renewable biomass. The polymer is based on a commercial
   hot-melt acrylic formulation containing primarily 2-ethylhexyl acrylate
   (EHA). The new polymer is synthesized with a majority of the EHA
   replaced with a macromonomer (MM) prepared with L-lactide and
   epsilon-caprolactone via catalyzed bulk ring-opening polymerization
   using N-hydroxyethyl acrylamide as the initiator. Incorporation of the
   MM into the polymers was confirmed via proton NMR The properties and
   adhesive performance of the new polymer were compared with those of its
   100\% acrylic commercial version. When synthesized using the same
   approach, the biomass-containing PSA had a lower molecular weight,
   higher glass transition temperature, and lower melt viscosity.
   Introduction of MM had little impact on the tack force, shear time, and
   shear adhesion failure temperature, and the peel strength increased
   substantially. It is expected that these hybrid materials can be
   optimized for a variety of self-adhesive applications.}},

Title = {{Spectral clustering of high-dimensional data exploiting sparse

Abstract = {{Clustering high-dimensional data has been a challenging problem in data
   mining and machining learning. Spectral clustering via sparse
   representation has been proposed for clustering high-dimensional data. A
   critical stepin spectral clustering is to effectively construct a weight
   matrix by assessing the proximity between each pair of objects. While
   sparse representation has proved its effectiveness for compressing
   high-dimensional signals, existing spectral clustering algorithms based
   on sparse representation use individual sparse coefficients directly.
   However, exploiting complete sparse representation vectors is expected
   to reflect more truthful similarity among data objects, since more
   contextual information is being considered. The intuition is that sparse
   representation vectors corresponding to two similar objects are expected
   to be similar, while those of two dissimilar objects are dissimilar. In
   particular, we propose two weight matrix constructions for spectral
   clustering based on the similarity of the sparse representation vectors.
   Experimental results on several real-world, high-dimensional datasets
   demonstrate that spectral clustering based on the proposed weight
   matrices outperforms existing spectral clustering algorithms, which use
   sparse coefficients directly. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by

Abstract = {{A Monte Carlo model is applied to determinate the steady state,
   solar-weighted optical properties of potential thermotropic composite
   materials for overheat protection of polymer solar absorbers. The key
   results are dimensionless plots of normal-hemispherical transmittance,
   reflectance and absorptance as a function of particle size parameter,
   scattering albedo, and overall optical thickness. The optical behavior
   of thermotropic materials at different temperatures is represented by a
   change in the relative refractive index which affects the scattering
   albedo and optical thickness. At low temperatures where overheat
   protection is not required, referred to as the clear state, the overall
   optical thickness should be less than 0.3 to ensure high transmittance
   for the preferred particle size parameter of 2. At higher temperatures
   where overheat protection is required, referred to as the translucent
   state, the overall optical thickness should be greater than 10 and the
   scattering albedo should be greater than 0.995 to achieve 50\%
   reflectance. A case study of low molecular weighted polyethylene in
   poly(methyl methacrylate) is presented to illustrate use of the results
   to guide the design of thermotropic materials.}},

Abstract = {{A transcriptomic analysis of bacteroids isolated from soybean plants

   HM-arabinose medium was performed and the results combined with two
   other transcriptomic analyses to form a reiterated pool of transcripts
   that define genes expressed during symbiotic nitrogen fixation. The
   majority of annotated genes represented in the reiterated transcript
   pool with increased expression had already been identified by prior
   experimentation demonstrating the validity of the reiterated transcript
   approach. The majority of all reiterated transcripts with increased
   expression in bacteroids were hypothetical genes suggesting many
   symbiotic processes have yet to be identified. Genes for carbon
   metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism and transport genes
   were represented by only a few reiterated transcripts suggesting these
   annotated processes do not participate in symbiosis, are masked by
   experimental conditions, or are fulfilled by hypothetical/unknown genes.
   Bioinformatic analysis revealed a statistically significant bias of the
   AG content of the reiterated transcripts with increased expression. A
   DNA motif identified in the reiterated transcripts with decreased
   expression was found preceding malate dehydrogenase (bll0456) and
   demonstrated to perform a role in expression of the gene.}},

Abstract = {{Cross-ISA system-mode emulation has many important applications. For
   example, Cross-ISA system-mode emulation helps computer architects and
   OS developers trace and debug kernel execution-flow efficiently by
   emulating a slower platform (such as ARM) on a more powerful platform
   (such as an x86 machine). Cross-ISA system-mode emulation also enables
   workload consolidation in data centers with platforms of different
   instruction-set architectures (ISAs). However, system-mode emulation is
   much slower. One major overhead in system-mode emulation is the
   multi-level memory address translation that maps guest virtual address
   to host physical address. Shadow page tables (SPT) have been used to
   reduce such overheads, but primarily for same-ISA virtualization. In
   this paper we propose a novel approach called embedded shadow page
   tables (ESPT). EPST embeds a shadow page table into the address space of
   a cross-ISA dynamic binary translation (DBT) and uses hardware memory
   management unit in the CPU to translate memory addresses, instead of
   software translation in a current DBT emulator like QEMU. We also use
   the larger address space on modern 64-bit CPUs to accommodate our DBT
   emulator so that it will not interfere with the guest operating system.
   We incorporate our new scheme into QEMU, a popular, retargetable
   cross-ISA system emulator. SPEC CINT2006 benchmark results indicate that
   our technique achieves an average speedup of 1.51 times in system mode
   when emulating ARM on x86, and a 1.59 times speedup for emulating IA32
   on x86\_64.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic Binary Instrumentation (DBI) is a core technology for building
   debugging and profiling tools for application executables. Most
   state-of-the-art DBI systems have focused on the same instruction set
   architecture (ISA) where the guest binary and the host binary have the
   same ISA. It is uncommon to have a cross-ISA DBI system, such as a
   system that instruments ARM executables to run on x86 machines. We
   believe cross-ISA DBI systems are increasingly more important, since ARM
   executables could be more productively analyzed on x86 based machines
   such as commonly available PCs and servers.
   In this paper, we present DBILL, a cross-ISA and retargetable dynamic
   binary instrumentation framework that builds on both QEMU and LLVM. The
   DBILL framework enables LLVM-based static instrumentation tools to
   become DBI ready, and deployable to different target architectures.
   Using address sanitizer and memory sanitizer as implementation examples,
   we show DBILL is an efficient, versatile and easy to use cross-ISA
   retargetable DBI framework.}},

Title = {{Spray-cooling concept for wind-based compressed air energy storage}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF RENEWABLE AND SUSTAINABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Wind turbine output energy varies over time with local wind speed and is
   typically inconsistent with grid power demand. Without energy storage,
   the resulting difference between rated (peak) power and average power
   output leads to oversizing of electrical generator and transmission
   lines. This conventional arrangement can be avoided if wind turbines can
   be coupled with energy storage to eliminate the output variations and
   instead produce their average power on a continuous basis. This would
   allow a smaller, lower-cost, constant-speed generator and a reduced
   capacity transmission system sized only for average power output. To
   accomplish this goal, this study discusses a concept for a storage
   system for a 5MW off-shore wind turbine, which integrates a spray-based
   compressed air energy storage with a 35 MPa accumulator. The compressor
   employs a liquid piston for air sealing and employs water spray to
   augment heat transfer for high-efficiency. The overall compression is
   proposed in three stages with pressure ratios of 10:1, 7:1, and 5:1, all
   operated at 1Hz to maintain moderate liquid surface acceleration. Based
   on a simple and fundamental description of the system, compression
   efficiency was found to be strongly dependent on droplet surface area,
   which can be achieved through either high mass loading or small drop
   sizes. The simulations also show that direct injection spray can
   increase overall three-stage compression efficiency to as high as 89\%,
   substantially better than the 27\% associated with a conventional
   adiabatic compression at the same pressure ratio. In addition, this
   study introduces a key performance parameter, termed the Levelization
   Factor, which can be used to quantify the impact of storage on wind
   energy systems. However, experiments and simulations based on 3-D
   geometries with design details are needed to determine the potential of
   this concept. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A natural optimization model that formulates many online resource
   allocation problems is the online linear programming ( LP) problem in
   which the constraint matrix is revealed column by column along with the
   corresponding objective coefficient. In such a model, a decision
   variable has to be set each time a column is revealed without observing
   the future inputs, and the goal is to maximize the overall objective
   function. In this paper, we propose a near-optimal algorithm for this
   general class of online problems under the assumptions of random order
   of arrival and some mild conditions on the size of the LP
   right-hand-side input. Specifically, our learning-based algorithm works
   by dynamically updating a threshold price vector at geometric time
   intervals, where the dual prices learned from the revealed columns in
   the previous period are used to determine the sequential decisions in
   the current period. Through dynamic learning, the competitiveness of our
   algorithm improves over the past study of the same problem. We also
   present a worst case example showing that the performance of our
   algorithm is near optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Classical variational data assimilation methods address the problem of
   optimally combining model predictions with observations in the presence
   of zero-mean Gaussian random errors. However, in many natural systems,
   uncertainty in model structure and/or model parameters often results in
   systematic errors or biases. Prior knowledge about such systematic model
   error for parametric removal is not always feasible in practice,
   limiting the efficient use of observations for improved prediction. The
   main contribution of this work is to advocate the relevance of
   transportation metrics for quantifying nonrandom model error in
   variational data assimilation for nonnegative natural states and fluxes.
   Transportation metrics (also known as Wasserstein metrics) originate in
   the theory of Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) and provide a nonparametric
   way to compare distributions which is natural in the sense that it
   penalizes mismatch in the values and relative position of ``masses'' in
   the two distributions. We demonstrate the promise of the proposed
   methodology using 1-D and 2-D advection-diffusion dynamics with
   systematic error in the velocity and diffusivity parameters. Moreover,
   we combine this methodology with additional regularization functionals,
   such as the l(1)-norm of the state in a properly chosen domain, to
   incorporate both model error and potential prior information in the
   presence of sparsity or sharp fronts in the underlying state of
   interest.}},

Abstract = {{Inorganic carbon is a fundamental component for microalgal lipid
   biosynthesis. Understanding how the concentration and speciation of
   dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) influences lipid metabolism in
   microalgae may help researchers optimize the production of these high
   value metabolites. Using relatively straight forward methods for
   quantifying free fatty acids (FFAs), mono- (MAG), di- (DAG),
   tri-acylglycerides (TAG), and total cellular fatty acids (FAME), lipid
   profiles over time were established for Chlamydomonas reinhardtii when
   grown under three unique inorganic carbon regimes. Specifically,
   cultures sparged with atmospheric air were compared to cultures which
   were sparged with 5\% CO2 (v/v) and cultures supplemented with 50 mM
   NaHCO3 just prior to medium nitrogen depletion. All three conditions
   exhibited similar lipid profiles prior to nitrogen depletion in the
   medium, with FFA and MAG being the predominant lipid metabolites.
   However, these precursors were quickly reallocated into DAG and
   subsequently TAG after nitrogen depletion. C-16 DAG did not accumulate
   significantly in any of the treatments, whereas the C-18 DAG content
   increased throughout both exponential growth and stationary phase. C-16
   and C-18 TAG began to accumulate after nitrogen depletion, with C-16 TAG
   contributing the most to overall TAG content. C-16 fatty acids exhibited
   a shift towards saturated C-16 fatty acids after nitrogen depletion.
   Results provide insight into inorganic carbon partitioning into lipid
   compounds and how the organism's lipid metabolism changes due to
   N-deplete culturing and inorganic carbon source availability. The
   methodologies and findings presented here may be adapted to other
   organisms with high industrial relevance. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All

   SrTiO3-delta crystals can be used as an optically addressable magnetic
   memory by writing and subsequently reading magnetic patterns with light.
   The induced magnetization is consistent with that of a polarized

   plasmid DNA at neutral pH. The strength of DNA binding is dependent on
   the length of PMAOE chains. NMR analysis reveals that hydrolysis of the
   ortho ester group of PMAOE follows an exocyclic mechanism and the rate
   of hydrolysis is much accelerated at mildly acidic pH, leading to
   accelerated disruption of polyplexes and release of DNA in mildly acidic
   environment. PMAOE is not toxic to cultured NIH 3T3 and COS-7 cells
   measured by MTT. This study demonstrates a unique mechanism of achieving

Abstract = {{During vesicular trafficking and release of enveloped viruses, the
   budding and fission processes dynamically remodel the donor cell
   membrane in a protein- or a lipid-mediated manner. In all cases, in
   addition to the generation or relief of the curvature stress, the buds
   recruit specific lipids and proteins from the donor membrane through
   restricted diffusion for the development of a ring-type raft domain of
   closed topology. Here, by reconstituting the bud topography in a model
   membrane, we demonstrate the preferential localization of cholesterol-
   and sphingomyelin-enriched microdomains in the collar band of the
   bud-neck interfaced with the donor membrane. The geometrical approach to
   the recapitulation of the dynamic membrane reorganization, resulting
   from the local radii of curvatures from nanometre-to-micrometre scales,
   offers important clues for understanding the active roles of the bud
   topography in the sorting and migration machinery of key signalling
   proteins involved in membrane budding.}},

Number = {{2}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The claim that classical nucleation theory (CNT) correctly predicts the
   dependence on supersaturation of the steady-state rate of homogeneous
   nucleation is reexamined in light of recent experimental studies of
   nucleation of a range of substances, including water, argon, nitrogen,
   and several 1-alcohols. Based on these studies (which include, for
   water, a compilation of nine different studies), it is concluded that
   the dependence of nucleation rate on supersaturation is not correctly
   predicted by CNT. It is shown that CNT's incorrect prediction of the
   supersaturation dependence of nucleation rate is due to its incorrect
   prediction of the Gibbs free energy change associated with formation of
   small clusters from the monomer vapor, evaluated at the substance's
   equilibrium vapor pressure, even though that free energy change is
   itself a function only of temperature. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgae harvesting is a labor-and energy-intensive process and new
   approaches to harvesting microalgae need to be developed in order to
   decrease the costs. In this study; co-cultivatation of filamentous
   fungus (Aspergillus niger) and microalgae (Chlorella vulgaris) to form
   cell pellets was evaluated under different conditions, including organic
   carbon source (glucose; glycerol; and sodium acetate) concentration;
   initial concentration of fungal spores and microalgal cells and light.
   Results showed that 2 g/L of glucose with a 1: 300 ratio of fungi to
   microalgae provided the best culturing conditions for the process to
   reach >90\% of cell harvest efficiency. The results also showed that an
   organic carbon source was required to sustain the growth of fungi and
   form the cell pellets. The microalgae/fungi co-cultures at mixotrophic
   conditions obtained much higher total biomass than pure cultures of each
   individual strains; indicating the symbiotic relationship between two
   strains. This can benefit the microbial biofuel production in terms of

Abstract = {{As a crucial operation, routing plays an important role in various
   communication networks. In the context of data and sensor networks,
   routing strategies such as shortest-path, multi-path and potential-based
   ({''}all-path'') routing have been developed. Existing results in the
   literature show that the shortest path and all-path routing can be
   obtained from L-1 and L-2 flow optimization, respectively. Based on this
   connection between routing and flow optimization in a network, in this
   paper we develop a unifying theoretical framework by considering flow
   optimization with mixed (weighted) L1/L2-norms. We obtain a surprising
   result: as we vary the trade-off parameter theta, the routing graphs
   induced by the optimal flow solutions span from shortest-path to
   multi-path to all-path routing-this entire sequence of routing graphs is
   referred to as the routing continuum. We also develop an efficient
   iterative algorithm for computing the entire routing continuum. Several
   generalizations are also considered, with applications to traffic
   engineering, wireless sensor networks, and network robustness analysis.}},

Title = {{A constitutive model for a linearly elastic peridynamic body}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{19}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Constitutive modeling within peridynamic theory considers the collective
   deformation at each time of all the material within a delta-neighborhood
   of any point of a peridynamic body. The assignment of the parameter
   delta, called the horizon, is treated as a material property. The
   difference displacement quotient field in this neighborhood, rather than
   the extension scalar field, is used to generate a three-dimensional
   state-based linearly elastic peridynamic theory. This yields an enhanced
   interpretation of the kinematics between bonds that includes both length
   and relative angle changes. A free energy function for a linearly
   elastic isotropic peridynamic material that contains four material
   constants is proposed as a model, and it is used to obtain the force
   vector state and the associated modulus state for this material. These
   states are analogous to, respectively, the stress field and the
   fourth-order elasticity tensor in classical linear theory. In the limit
   of small horizon, we find that only three of the four peridynamic
   material constants are related to the classical elastic coefficients of
   an isotropic linear elastic material, with one of the three constants
   being arbitrary. The fourth peridynamic material constant, which
   accounts for the coupling effect of both bond length and relative angle
   change, has no effect on the limit, but remains a part of the
   peridynamic model. The determination of the two undetermined constants
   is the subject of future investigation. Peridynamic models proposed
   elsewhere in the literature depend on the deformation state through its
   dilatational and deviatoric parts and contain only two peridynamic
   material constants, in analogy to the classical linear elasticity
   theory. Observe from above that our model depends on both length and
   relative angle changes, as in classical linear theory, but, otherwise,
   is not limited to having only two material constants. In addition, our
   model corresponds to a nonordinary material, which represents a
   substantial break with classical models.}},

Abstract = {{Besides being the foundational material for microelectronics,
   crystalline silicon has long been used for the production of infrared
   lenses and mirrors. More recently, silicon has become the key material
   to achieve large-scale integration of photonic devices for on-chip
   optical interconnect and signal processing. For optics, silicon has
   significant advantages: it offers a very high refractive index and is
   highly transparent in the spectral range from 1.2 to 8,mu m. To fully
   exploit silicon's superior performance in a remarkably broad range and
   to enable new optoelectronic functionalities, here we describe a general
   method to integrate silicon photonic devices on arbitrary foreign
   substrates. In particular, we apply the technique to integrate silicon
   microring resonators on mid-infrared compatible substrates for operation
   in the mid-infrared. These high-performance mid-infrared optical
   resonators are utilized to demonstrate, for the first time, on-chip
   cavity-enhanced mid-infrared spectroscopic analysis of organic chemicals

Abstract = {{Supply disruptions are all too common in supply chains. To mitigate
   delivery risk, buyers may either source from multiple suppliers or offer
   incentives to their preferred supplier to improve its process
   reliability. These incentives can be either direct (investment subsidy)
   or indirect (inflated order quantity). In this study, we present a
   series of models to highlight buyers' and suppliers' optimal parameter
   choices. Our base-case model has deterministic buyer demand and two
   possibilities for the supplier yield outcomes: all-or-nothing supply or
   partial disruption. For the all-or-nothing model, we show that the buyer
   prefers to only use the subsidy option, which obviates the need to
   inflate order quantity. However, in the partial disruption model, both
   incentives-subsidy and order inflation-may be used at the same time.
   Although single sourcing provides greater indirect incentive to the
   selected supplier because that avoids order splitting, we show that the
   buyer may prefer the diversification strategy under certain
   circumstances. We also quantify the amount by which the wholesale price
   needs to be discounted (if at all) to ensure that dual sourcing strategy
   dominates sole sourcing. Finally, we extend the model to the case of
   stochastic demand. Structural properties of ordering/subsidy decisions
   are derived for the all-or-nothing model, and in contrast to the
   deterministic demand case, we establish that the buyer may increase use
   of subsidy and order quantity at the same time.}},

Abstract = {{C-4-C-6 olefin beta-scission rate constants were inferred from
   experimental studies at 773-813 K and <15\% conversion by considering
   every C-4-C-6 olefin isomer and all available beta-scission modes: 2
   degrees to 2 degrees (C), 1 degrees to 3 degrees and 3 degrees to 1
   degrees (E), 1 degrees to 2 degrees and 2 degrees to 1 degrees (D), and
   1 degrees to 1 degrees (F). Group contribution methods were implemented
   to assess adsorption enthalpies and entropies of C-4-C-6 olefin isomers
   on H-ZSM-5 via the development of group correction terms for surface
   alkoxides; a linear dependence of enthalpy (or entropy) of formation
   difference between a surface alkoxide and a gas-phase alkane on carbon
   number was considered. Tertiary alkoxides have the smallest adsorption
   constants among surface adsorbates, and the resulting low coverage of
   highly substituted alkoxides restricts their contribution to alkene
   cracking pathways. Intrinsic beta-scission rate constants
   (k(E):k(C):k(D):k(F) ratio of 1094:21:8:1 at 783 K) and activation
   energies (E-inE < E-inC < E-inD < E-inF) from experimentally observed
   effluent compositions of C-4-C-6 olefin cracking consistent with
   computational studies were derived after rigorously accounting for
   adsorption constants and surface coverages of each C-4-C-6 olefin
   isomer. These results demonstrate that shape selectivity constraints
   prevent equilibration of surface alkoxides on surfaces under reaction
   conditions relevant for alkene cracking and present a quantitative
   description of C-C bond cracking reactions of olefins catalyzed by solid
   acids.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of amphiphilic block copolymers, poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(2-methyl-acrylicacid
   2-methoxy-5-methyl-{[}1,3]dioxin-5-ylmethyl ester) (PEG-b-PMME), bearing
   acid-labile six-membered ortho ester rings in side chains was
   synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer
   polymerization, and the influence of chain length of the hydrophobic
   PMME block on micelle properties was investigated. The PEG-b-PMME
   micelles were stable in aqueous buffer at physiological pH with a low
   critical micelle concentration. Nile Red as a model drug was
   encapsulated into the micelles to explore the release profiles. The Nile
   Red-loaded polymeric micelles showed rapid release of Nile Red in weakly
   acidic environments (pH 5) but slow release under physiological
   condition (pH 7.4), due to different hydrolysis rate of ortho ester side
   chains of PEG-b-PMME. The Paclitaxel (PTX)-loaded micelles retained
   potency in killing lung cancer cells (A549), compared with the free PTX.
   No obvious toxicity was found in vitro and in vivo after intraperitoneal
   injection of the micelles, which confirms that the PEG-b-PMME micelles
   with unique acid-labile characteristic have great potential as
   nano-scaled carriers for drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{Chewing gum provides an excellent everyday example of viscoelastic
   behavior, and understanding its rheological properties is important for
   application purposes. Here, we compare the rheological behavior of
   selected commercial chewing gums and bubble gums. Small amplitude
   oscillatory shear, shear creep, and steady shear demonstrated that both
   chewing and bubble gums behave like power-law critical gels in the
   linear regime. Nonlinear viscoelastic behavior was investigated using
   large amplitude oscillatory shear, shear creep, and start-up flows (in
   shear and uniaxial extension). Bubble gums showed more pronounced strain
   hardening and greater stresses to break in start-up of steady uniaxial
   extension than chewing gums. We argue that this combination of
   rheological signatures is sufficient to provide a new robust definition
   of chewing gum that is independent of specific molecular composition.
   There are potentially many different formulations and design routes that
   can achieve this distinctive rheological fingerprint. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The mass transfer and reaction kinetics of sulfuryl fluoride (SO2F2)

   with aqueous NaOH solutions was determined to be 1.44 m(3)/(mol.s) at
   298 K. Three models were used in this chemical absorption process, and
   in each case, the same expression of enhancement factor was obtained. A
   comparison was made between the experimental enhancement factor and the
   value calculated from the model, and the maximum relative deviation was
   less than 4.2\%. The proposed model expression gave a reasonable fit

Abstract = {{Conversion of lignocellulosic material to ethanol is a major challenge
   in second generation bio-fuel production by yeast Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae. This report describes a novel strategy named ``two-stage
   transcriptional reprogramming (TSTR){''} in which key gene expression at
   both glucose and xylose fermentation phases is optimized in engineered
   S. cerevisiae. Through a combined genome-wide screening of
   stage-specific promoters and the balancing of the metabolic flux,
   ethanol yields and productivity from mixed sugars were significantly
   improved. In a medium containing 50 g/L glucose and 50 g/L xylose, the
   top-performing strain WXY12 rapidly consumed glucose within 12 h and
   within 84 h it consistently achieved an ethanol yield of 0.48 g/g total
   sugar, which was 94\% of the theoretical yield. WXY12 utilizes a KGD1
   inducible promoter to drive xylose metabolism, resulting in much higher
   ethanol yield than a reference strain using a strong constitutive PGK1
   promoter. These promising results validate the TSTR strategy by
   synthetically regulating the xylose assimilation pathway towards
   efficient xylose fermentation. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by

Journal = {{VEHICLE SYSTEM DYNAMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{52}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{875-890}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{A rigid body model to represent a side impact crash is constructed using
   five degrees-of-freedom (dof) for the vehicle and three dof for each
   occupant in the vehicle. Nonlinear stiffness and damping elements and
   the presence of physical gaps between several components make the model
   highly nonlinear. The model is validated using experimental crash test
   data from a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)
   database. To simplify the parameter identification process and reduce
   the number of parameters to be identified at each stage, a two-step
   process is adopted in which the vehicle is first assumed to be
   unaffected by the presence of the occupants, and its model parameters
   are identified. Subsequently, the parameters in the occupant models are
   identified.
   The active set method with a performance index that includes both the
   L-2 and L-infinity norms is used for parameter identification. A
   challenge is posed by the fact that the optimisation problem involved is
   non-convex. To overcome this challenge, a large set of random initial
   values of parameter estimates is generated and the optimisation method
   is applied with all these initial conditions. The values of parameters
   that provide the minimal performance index from the entire set of
   initial conditions are then chosen as the best parameter values. The
   optimal parameters values thus identified are shown to significantly
   improve the match between the model responses and the experimentally
   measured sensor signals from the NHTSA crash test.}},

Abstract = {{All-optical transduction of ultrasound provides high-frequency (>20 MHz)
   operation in the absence of electrical noise and distortion that hinders
   small-scale piezoelectric probes. Although fabrication of an all-optical
   2-D array suitable for in vivo imaging remains incomplete, a thin-film
   structure integrating a polyimide film with a Fabry-Perot (etalon)
   receiver has been shown to be a viable candidate. We present here
   incremental improvements in the performance of a polyimide-etalon
   transducer and demonstrate imaging with an array configuration
   alternative to our previous study. We first show that a gain of more
   than 30\% in output pressure is achieved when increasing the thickness
   of a bare polyimide film from 3 to 15 mu m. This motivated the choice of
   polyimide as the etalon medium-a configuration made possible by
   utilizing a dielectric mirror that transmits wavelengths used for
   generation of ultrasound (ultraviolet) and reflects those for detection
   (near infrared). The increased reflectivity of the dielectric mirror
   resulted in a 2-fold decrease in noise-equivalent pressure to 3.3 kPa
   over a bandwidth of 47.5 MHz (0.48 Pa/root Hz). The transmit/receive
   center frequency increased from 37 to 49 MHz with a -6-dB bandwidth of
   126\%, and a maximum pressure of 213 kPa was produced using a 43 mu m UV
   spot. A 2 x 2 mm synthetic array of 957 transmitters centered on a 1 x 1
   mm synthetic array of four receivers was used to image two wire targets.
   Offline reconstruction indicated lateral resolutions of 70 and 114 m at
   depths of 2.4 and 5.8 mm, respectively, with an average axial resolution
   of 35 mu m. Finally, we explore the challenges of imaging in this
   configuration, which provides the best opportunity for real-time
   performance pending further development.}},

Title = {{The Impacts of Triclosan on Anaerobic Community Structures, Function,

Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{7393-7400}},

Abstract = {{Triclosan is a widespread antimicrobial agent that accumulates in
   anaerobic digesters used to treat the residual solids generated at
   municipal wastewater treatment plants; there is very little information,
   however, about how triclosan impacts microbial communities in anaerobic
   digesters. We investigated how triclosan impacts the community
   structure, function and antimicrobial resistance genes in lab-scale
   anaerobic digesters. Previously exposed (to triclosan) communities were
   amended with 5, 50, and 500 mg/kg of triclosan, corresponding to the
   median, 95th percentile, and 4-fold higher than maximum triclosan
   concentration that has been detected in U.S. biosolids. Triclosan
   amendment caused all of the Bacteria and Archaea communities to
   structurally diverge from that of the control cultures (based on ARISA).
   At the end of the experiment, all triclosan-amended Archaea communities
   had diverged from the control communities, regardless of the triclosan
   concentration added. In contrast, over time the Bacteria communities
   that were amended with lower concentrations of triclosan (5 mg/kg and 50
   mg/kg) initially diverged and then reconverged with the control
   community structure. Methane production at 500 mg/kg was nearly half the
   methane production in control cultures. At 50 mg/kg, a large variability
   in methane production was observed, suggesting that 50 mg/kg may be a
   tipping point where function begins to fail in some communities. When
   previously unexposed communities were exposed to 500 mg triclosan/kg,
   function was maintained, but the abundance of a gene encoding for
   triclosan resistance (mexB) increased. This research suggests that
   triclosan could inhibit methane production in anaerobic digesters if
   concentrations were to increase and may also select for resistant
   Bacteria. In both cases, microbial community composition and exposure
   history alter the influence of triclosan.}},

Abstract = {{Fluorescently labeled proteins that are found both in the cytoplasm and
   at the plasma membrane, such as peripheral membrane proteins, create
   stratified fluorescent layers that present a challenging environment for
   brightness studies with fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy. The
   geometry of each layer along with fluorescence and brightness
   contributions from adjacent layers generates a convoluted raw brightness
   that conceals the underlying brightness of each individual layer.
   Because the brightness at a layer establishes the oligomeric state of
   the fluorescently labeled protein at said layer, we developed a method
   that connects the experimental raw brightness with the physical
   brightness at each layered compartment. The technique determines the
   oligomerization in each compartment from an axial intensity scan through
   the sample, followed by a fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy
   measurement at each layer. We experimentally verify the technique with
   H-Ras-EGFP as a model system and determine its oligomeric state at both
   the plasma membrane and in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, we study the
   oligomerization of the Gag matrix domain of Human T-lymphotropic virus
   Type 1. The matrix domain targets the Gag polyprotein to the plasma
   membrane where, subsequently, viral assembly occurs. We determine the
   oligomerization of matrix in the cytoplasm and observe the onset of
   protein-protein interactions at the membrane. These observations shed
   light on the early assembly steps of the retrovirus.}},

Abstract = {{We are interested in assigning a pre-specified number of nodes as
   leaders in order to minimize the mean-square deviation from consensus in
   stochastically forced networks. This problem arises in several
   applications including control of vehicular formations and localization
   in sensor networks. For networks with leaders subject to noise, we show
   that the Boolean constraints (which indicate whether a node is a leader)
   are the only source of nonconvexity. By relaxing these constraints to
   their convex hull we obtain a lower bound on the global optimal value.
   We also use a simple but efficient greedy algorithm to identify leaders
   and to compute an upper bound. For networks with leaders that perfectly
   follow their desired trajectories, we identify an additional source of
   nonconvexity in the form of a rank constraint. Removal of the rank
   constraint and relaxation of the Boolean constraints yields a
   semidefinite program for which we develop a customized algorithm
   well-suited for large networks. Several examples ranging from regular
   lattices to random graphs are provided to illustrate the effectiveness
   of the developed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the motion control of a camless engine valve
   actuation system during both steady state and transient engine
   operation. The precise tracking performance obtained using controllers
   based on the internal model principle for the constant speed case
   motivates the investigation under engine speed transients. The cyclic
   but aperiodic reference signal to be tracked is modeled using two
   different methods, i.e., as a combination of frequency varying sinusoids
   in the time domain or as a repetitive (periodic) signal in the
   rotational angle domain. The recently developed time-varying internal
   model-based controller is ideally suited for both the approaches. The
   details associated with the design of the controller for each of the
   approaches are first documented. A quantitative analysis comparing
   various performance metrics for both the approaches helps to highlight
   the relative advantages of each method. The experimental results from a
   prototype camless engine valve actuation system are then presented to
   help in validating the overall effectiveness of the proposed control
   method.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{3305-3320}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Prediction of dynamical processes evolving over network graphs is a
   basic task encountered in various areas of science and engineering. The
   prediction challenge is exacerbated when only partial network
   observations are available, that is when only measurements from a subset
   of nodes are available. To tackle this challenge, the present work
   introduces a joint topology- and data-driven approach for network-wide
   prediction able to handle partially observed network data. First, the
   known network structure and historical data are leveraged to design a
   dictionary for representing the network process. The novel approach
   draws from semi-supervised learning to enable learning the dictionary
   with only partial network observations. Once the dictionary is learned,
   network-wide prediction becomes possible via a regularized least-squares
   estimate which exploits the parsimony encapsulated in the design of the
   dictionary. Second, an online network-wide prediction algorithm is
   developed to jointly extrapolate the process over the network and update
   the dictionary accordingly. This algorithm is able to handle large
   training datasets at a fixed computational cost. More important, the
   online algorithm takes into account the temporal correlation of the
   underlying process, and thereby improves prediction accuracy. The
   performance of the novel algorithms is illustrated for prediction of
   real Internet traffic. There, the proposed approaches are shown to
   outperform competitive alternatives.}},

   FKN-S2 Aptamer-Amphiphiles}},

Abstract = {{Previously we identified an aptamer, named FKN-S2, which binds the cell
   surface protein fractalkine with high affinity and specificity. In this
   paper a hydrophobic dialkyl C-16 tail was added to the aptamer to create
   an aptamer-amphiphile. We investigated how the tail and a spacer
   molecule of varying length and hydrophobicity, inserted between the tail
   and the aptamer headgroup, affect the binding, structure, and
   self-assembly properties of the aptamer-amphiphile. We synthesized
   aptamer-amphiphiles with no spacer (NoSPR), polyethylene glycol (PEG(4),
   PEG(8), PEG(24)), alkyl (C-12 and C-24), or oligonucleotide (T-10 and
   T-s: 10 and S thymine, and A(10): 10 adenine) spacers. The addition of
   the tail reduced the binding affinity of the aptamer-amphiphile over
   7.5-fold compared to the free aptamer. The hydrophobic alkyl spacers
   resulted in the greatest loss of affinity, and the hydrophilic PEG
   spacers improved amphiphile affinity but did not restore it to that of
   the free aptamer. Interestingly, oligonucleotide spacers produced the
   highest affinity amphiphiles. Nucleotide composition did not affect
   affinity, however, as the T-10 and A(10) spacers had equal affinity. The
   oligonucleotide spacer amphiphiles had the highest affinity because the
   oligonucleotide spacer increased the affinity of free aptamer; the
   FKN-S2 aptamer plus the oligonucleotide spacer had a higher affinity
   than the free FKN-52 aptamer. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and
   thermal melting studies indicated the aptamer forms a stem loop and
   intramolecular G-quadruple; and the tail strongly stabilized the
   formation of the G-quadruplex in a buffer. Cryogenic transmission
   electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) imaging showed the aptamer-amphiphiles,
   independent of the spacer used, self-assembled into micelles and
   nanotapes, flat bilayer structures that were often twisted. Finally,
   liposomes functionalized with the FKN-S2 amphiphile were incubated with
   fractalkine expressing cells, and the amount of binding was dependent on
   the concentration of the amphiphile on the liposome surface.}},

Abstract = {{The quasicontinuum (QC) method, in its local (continuum) limit, is
   applied to materials with a multilattice crystal structure. Cauchy-Born
   (CB) kinematics, which accounts for the shifts of the crystal motif, is
   used to relate atomic motions to continuum deformation gradients. To
   avoid failures of CB kinematics, QC is augmented with a phonon stability
   analysis that detects lattice period extensions and identifies the
   minimum required periodic cell size. This approach is referred to as
   Cascading Cauchy-Born kinematics (CCB). In this paper, the method is
   described and developed. It is then used, along with an effective
   interaction potential (EIP) model for shape-memory alloys, to simulate
   the shape-memory effect and pseudoelasticity in a finite specimen. The
   results of these simulations show that (i) the CCB methodology is an
   essential tool that is required in order for QC-type simulations to
   correctly capture the first-order phase transitions responsible for
   these material behaviors, and (ii) that the EIP model adopted in this
   work coupled with the QC/CCB methodology is capable of predicting the
   characteristic behavior found in shape-memory alloys.}},

   with neurofibromatosis type 1 syndrome. Reduced TP53 gene expression and
   amplification/overexpression of the epidermal growth factor receptor
   (EGFR) gene occur in MPNST formation. We focused on determining the
   cooperativity between reduced TP53 expression and EGFR overexpression
   for Schwann cell transformation in vitro (immortalized human Schwann
   cells) and MPNST formation in vivo (transgenic mice). Human gene copy
   number alteration data, microarray expression data, and TMA analysis
   indicate that TP53 haploinsufficiency and increased EGFR expression
   co-occur in human MPNST samples. Concurrent modulation of EGFR and TP53
   expression in HSC1 lambda cells significantly increased proliferation
   and anchorage-independent growth in vitro. Transgenic mice heterozygous
   for a Trp53-null allele and overexpressing EGFR in Schwann cells had a
   significant increase in neurofibroma and grade 3 PNST (MPNST) formation
   compared with single transgenic controls. Histological analysis of
   tumors identified a significant increase in pAkt expression in grade 3
   PNSTs compared with neurofibromas. Array comparative genome
   hybridization analysis of grade 3 PNSTs identified recurrent focal
   regions of chromosomal gains with significant enrichment in genes
   involved in extracellular signal-regulated kinase 5 signaling.
   Collectively, altered p53 expression cooperates with overexpression of
   EGFR in Schwann cells to enhance in vitro oncogenic properties and
   tumorigenesis and progression in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{The elasticity of monocarboaluminate hydrates, 3CaO center dot Al2O3
   center dot CaCO3 center dot xH(2)O (x = 11 or 8), has been investigated
   by first-principles calculations. Previous experimental study revealed
   that the fully hydrated monocarboaluminate (x = 11) exhibits
   exceptionally low compressibility compared to other reported calcium
   aluminate hydrates. This stiff hydration product can contribute to the
   strength of concrete made with Portland cements containing calcium
   carbonates. In this study, full elastic tensors and mechanical
   properties of the crystal structures with different water contents (x =
   11 or 8) are computed by first-principles methods based on density
   functional theory. The results indicate that the compressibility of
   monocarboaluminate is highly dependent on the water content in the
   interlayer region. The structure also becomes more isotropic with the
   addition of water molecules in this region. Since the monocarboaluminate
   is a key hydration product of limestone added cement, elasticity of the
   crystal is important to understand its mechanical impact on concrete.
   Besides, it is put forth that this theoretical calculation will be
   useful in predicting the elastic properties of other complex cementitous
   materials and the influence of ion exchange on compressibility.}},

Abstract = {{The technical performance of a hybrid `solar window' that provides
   heating in addition to daylighting is evaluated. A wavelength selective
   film is coupled with a compound parabolic concentrator (CPC) to reflect
   and concentrate the infrared portion of the solar spectrum onto a
   tubular absorber while transmitting the visible portion of the spectrum
   into the interior space. The optical performance of the CPC/selective
   film is predicted using a Monte Carlo Ray-Tracing model. An adaptive
   concentrator geometry based on asymmetrical truncation of CPCs is
   analyzed for vertical windows and horizontal skylights. The predicted
   visible transmittance is 0.66-0.73 for single glazed windows and
   0.61-0.67 for double glazed windows. The solar heat gain coefficient and
   the U-factor are comparable to existing glazing technology. The annual
   thermal efficiency for double glazed windows/skylights based on use in
   Minneapolis, MN is 24-26\%. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to develop methods for simultaneously
   acquiring electrophysiological data during high-definition transcranial
   direct current stimulation (tDCS) using high-resolution
   electroencephalography (EEG). Previous studies have pointed to the
   after-effects of tDCS on both motor and cognitive performance, and there
   appears to be potential for using tDCS in a variety of clinical
   applications. However, little is known about the real-time effects of
   tDCS on rhythmic cortical activity in humans due to the technical
   challenges of simultaneously obtaining electrophysiological data during
   ongoing stimulation. Furthermore, the mechanisms of action of tDCS in
   humans are not well understood. We have conducted a simultaneous
   tDCS-EEG study in a group of healthy human subjects. Significant acute
   and persistent changes in spontaneous neural activity and event-related
   synchronization (ERS) were observed during and after the application of
   high-definition tDCS over the left sensorimotor cortex. Both anodal and
   cathodal stimulation resulted in acute global changes in broadband
   cortical activity which were significantly different than the changes
   observed in response to sham stimulation. For the group of eight
   subjects studied, broadband individual changes in spontaneous activity
   during stimulation were apparent both locally and globally. In addition,
   we found that high-definition tDCS of the left sensorimotor cortex can
   induce significant ipsilateral and contralateral changes in
   event-related desynchronization and ERS during motor imagination
   following the end of the stimulation period. Overall, our results
   demonstrate the feasibility of acquiring high-resolution EEG during
   high-definition tDCS and provide evidence that tDCS in humans directly
   modulates rhythmic cortical synchronization during and after its
   administration.}},

Title = {{Assessing Dynamic Spectral Causality by Lagged Adaptive Directed
   Transfer Function and Instantaneous Effect Factor}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{It is of significance to assess the dynamic spectral causality among
   physiological signals. Several practical estimators adapted from
   spectral Granger causality have been exploited to track dynamic
   causality based on the framework of time-varying multivariate
   autoregressive (tvMVAR) models. The nonzero co-variance of the model's
   residuals has been used to describe the instantaneous effect phenomenon
   in some causality estimators. However, for the situations with Gaussian
   residuals in some autoregressive models, it is challenging to
   distinguish the directed instantaneous causality if the sufficient prior
   information about the ``causal ordering{''} is missing. Here, we propose
   a new algorithm to assess the time-varying causal ordering of tvMVAR
   model under the assumption that the signals follow the same acyclic
   causal ordering for all time lags and to estimate the instantaneous
   effect factor (IEF) value in order to track the dynamic directed
   instantaneous connectivity. The time-lagged adaptive directed transfer
   function (ADTF) is also estimated to assess the lagged causality after
   removing the instantaneous effect. In this study, we first investigated
   the performance of the causal-ordering estimation algorithm and the
   accuracy of IEF value. Then, we presented the results of IEF and
   time-lagged ADTF method by comparing with the conventional ADTF method
   through simulations of various propagation models. Statistical analysis
   results suggest that the new algorithm could accurately estimate the
   causal ordering and give a good estimation of the IEF values in the
   Gaussian residual conditions. Meanwhile, the time-lagged ADTF approach
   is also more accurate in estimating the time-lagged dynamic interactions
   in a complex nervous system after extracting the instantaneous effect.
   In addition to the simulation studies, we applied the proposed method to

Abstract = {{Results are presented from transient numerical simulations of combustion
   of an isolated heptane (n-C7H16) droplet in nearly quiescent ambient
   air. The focus is on the effects of environment temperature and droplet
   size on the combustion characteristics. Droplet sizes range from 10 mu m
   to 1 mm, environment temperatures range from 800 K to 1600 K, and
   pressure is 1 atm.
   The results show that ignition delay times have a very moderate
   dependence on droplet diameter. With an increase in droplet diameter,
   the ignition delay time first decreases near the ignitable diameter and
   then increases far from the ignitable diameter. The ignition stand-off
   ratio always decreases with an increase in droplet diameter. A strong
   but short-lived convection, which is generated following the ignition,
   is demonstrated for the first time. The convection is caused by gas
   expansion which `pushes' the droplet toward the incoming flow. At lower
   temperatures, the transition from the kinetically controlled regime to
   the diffusion controlled regime is shifted to larger droplet diameters,
   and a larger range of droplet sizes is affected by the transition. Flame
   stand-off ratios are higher, and flame temperatures are lower, for small
   droplets. The transient evolution of heat release rate in droplet flames
   is presented for the first time. The heat release rate first exhibits
   thermal runaway (ignition), then decreases once the diffusion flame is
   established, and finally increases precipitously towards the end of the
   droplet lifetime due to an increase in strain rate. The heat release
   rates exhibit a strong dependence on droplet diameter.
   Finally, a comparison of the combustion characteristics of methanol and
   heptane droplets is presented, which establishes the differences in the
   phenomena reported in this paper and those reported for methanol. The
   increase in flame stand-off ratios and fuel vapor accumulation effects
   as droplet size is reduced, are qualitatively the same as those reported
   for methanol. The gasification rates and droplet surface temperatures
   for heptane exhibit less variation. Heptane flame locations lie in the
   fuel-rich zone whereas methanol flames are located at near
   stoichiometric mixture fractions. (C) 2014 The Combustion Institute.

Title = {{A Control-Oriented Two-Zone Charge Mixing Model for HCCI Engines With

Abstract = {{A control-oriented two-zone charge mixing model is developed to
   simplify, but to describe mixing of fresh charge and residual gas during
   the intake stroke. Engine valve timing has a strong influence on the
   realization of stable homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI),
   since it affects turbulent flow that promotes mixing of fresh charge and
   residual gas. Controlled auto-ignition of a HCCI engine is achieved by
   good mixing of fresh charge and residual gas. Therefore, it is useful to
   develop a mixing model that can be executed in real-time to help extend
   the operational range of HCCI. For model derivation, the cylinder volume
   is artificially divided into two zones with a fictitious divider between
   them. First, the mixed zone consists of fresh charge induced by opening
   intake valves and some residual gas transferred from the unmixed zone.
   They are assumed to have been mixed homogeneously so that cold fresh
   charge gains thermal energy from hot residual gas. Second, the unmixed
   zone contains the rest of hot residual gas. Mass transfer between them
   which is forced by a fluid jet is directed from the unmixed zone to the
   mixed one. Based on the definitions of two zones and interaction between
   them, a two-zone charge mixing model is derived. To investigate phasing
   effects of valve timing on charge mixing, comparative simulation was
   carried out with different valve timings. For experimental validation
   and calibration of the proposed model, optical engine tests were
   performed with an infrared (IR) camera, together with GT-power
   simulation. From good agreement between the model temperature and the
   estimated temperature from IR images, the model turns out to be useful
   to describe mixing of fresh charge and residual gas.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of two diblock copolymers,
   poly(ethylene-alt-propylene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PEP PEO) and
   poly(1,2-butadiene)-b-poly(2-vinyl pyridine) (PB P2VP) on the mechanical
   properties of epoxy coatings were studied. Both modifiers self-assembled
   into spherical micelles of 10-20nm diameter in cured bulk epoxy. This
   morphology was preserved in 15 mu m thick coatings; however, micelle
   segregation to the coating/substrate interface was also observed. The
   critical strain energy release rate, G(1C), of bulk thermosets was
   enhanced by up to fivefold with the addition of block copolymers.
   Likewise, the abrasive wear resistance of thin coatings increased with
   modifier inclusion. The results showed that at 5 wt.\% of loading, block
   copolymers were able to impart a 40\% increase in abrasive wear
   resistance to modified coatings over neat ones. Block copolymer
   modifiers did not sacrifice the modulus and glass transition temperature
   of bulk thermosets and coatings, or the hardness and transparency of
   coatings, or the hardness and transparency of coatings. (C) 2014
