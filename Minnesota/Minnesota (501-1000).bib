Abstract = {{Gradient-index (GRIN) media offer advantages over thin optical elements
   for beam shaping of strongly diffracting fields. A numerical GRIN design
   method is presented, where diffraction effects are considered in solving
   for the refractive index profile. The index profile is found by
   specifying a desired beam transformation throughout the GRIN volume and
   solving a series of phase retrieval problems. A Gaussian to flat-top
   beam shaper and a coherent beam combiner are shown as examples. Reduced
   beam distortion is demonstrated in comparison to a purely geometric
   design method. (C) 2016 Optical Society of America}},

Title = {{Model-Based Comparison of Deep Brain Stimulation Array Functionality
   with Varying Number of Radial Electrodes and Machine Learning Feature
   Sets}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN COMPUTATIONAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) leads with radially distributed electrodes
   have potential to improve clinical outcomes through more selective
   targeting of pathways and networks within the brain. However, increasing
   the number of electrodes on clinical DBS leads by replacing conventional
   cylindrical shell electrodes with radially distributed electrodes raises
   practical design and stimulation programming challenges. We used
   computational modeling to investigate: (1) how the number of radial
   electrodes impact the ability to steer, shift, and sculpt a region of
   neural activation (RoA), and (2) which RoA features are best used in
   combination with machine learning classifiers to predict programming
   settings to target a particular area near the lead. Stimulation
   configurations were modeled using 27 lead designs with one to nine
   radially distributed electrodes. The computational modeling framework
   consisted of a three-dimensional finite element tissue conductance model
   in combination with a multi-compartment biophysical axon model. For each
   lead design, two-dimensional threshold-dependent RoAs were calculated
   from the computational modeling results. The models showed more radial
   electrodes enabled finer resolution RoA steering; however, stimulation
   amplitude, and therefore spatial extent of the RoA, was limited by
   charge injection and charge storage capacity constraints due to the
   small electrode surface area for leads with more than four radially
   distributed electrodes. RoA shifting resolution was improved by the
   addition of radial electrodes when using uniform multi-cathode
   stimulation, but non-uniform multi-cathode stimulation produced
   equivalent or better resolution shifting without increasing the number
   of radial electrodes. Robust machine learning classification of 15
   monopolar stimulation configurations was achieved using as few as three
   geometric features describing a RoA. The results of this study indicate
   that, for a clinical-scale DBS lead, more than four radial electrodes
   minimally improved in the ability to steer, shift, and sculpt axonal
   activation around a DBS lead and a simple feature set consisting of the
   RoA center of mass and orientation enabled robust machine learning
   classification. These results provide important design constraints for
   future development of high-density DBS arrays.}},

Title = {{Multimodal 7T Imaging of Thalamic Nuclei for Preclinical Deep Brain
   Stimulation Applications}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JUN 10}},
Abstract = {{Precise neurosurgical targeting of electrode arrays within the brain is
   essential to the successful treatment of a range of brain disorders with
   deep brain stimulation (DBS) therapy. Here, we describe a set of
   computational tools to generate in vivo, subject-specific atlases of
   individual thalamic nuclei thus improving the ability to visualize
   thalamic targets for preclinical DBS applications on a subject-specific
   basis. A sequential nonlinear atlas warping technique and a Bayesian
   estimation technique for probabilistic crossing fiber tractography were
   applied to high field (7T) susceptibility-weighted and
   diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively, in seven rhesus macaques.
   Image contrast, including contrast within thalamus from the
   susceptibility-weighted images, informed the atlas warping process and
   guided the seed point placement for fiber tractography. The
   susceptibility-weighted imaging resulted in relative hyperintensity of
   the intralaminar nuclei and relative hypointensity in the medial dorsal
   nucleus, pulvinar, and the medial/ventral border of the ventral
   posterior nuclei, providing context to demarcate borders of the ventral
   nuclei of thalamus, which are often targeted for DBS applications.
   Additionally, ascending fiber tractography of the medial lemniscus,
   superior cerebellar peduncle, and pallidofugal pathways into thalamus
   provided structural demarcation of the ventral nuclei of thalamus. The
   thalamic substructure boundaries were validated through in vivo
   electrophysiological recordings and post-mortem blockface tissue
   sectioning. Together, these imaging tools for visualizing and segmenting
   thalamus have the potential to improve the neurosurgical targeting of
   DBS implants and enhance the selection of stimulation settings through
   more accurate computational models of DBS.}},

Abstract = {{At high thermal flux and temperatures of approximately 500 degrees C,
   lignocellulosic biomass transforms to a reactive liquid intermediate
   before evaporating to condensable bio-oil for downstream upgrading to
   renewable fuels and chemicals. However, the existence of a fraction of
   nonvolatile compounds in condensed bio-oil diminishes the product
   quality and, in the case of inorganic materials, catalyzes undesirable
   aging reactions within bio-oil. In this study, ablative pyrolysis of
   crystalline cellulose was evaluated, with and without doped calcium, for
   the generation of inorganic-transporting aerosols by reactive boiling
   ejection from liquid intermediate cellulose. Aerosols were characterized
   by laser diffraction light scattering, inductively coupled plasma
   spectroscopy, and high-speed photography. Pyrolysis product
   fractionation revealed that approximately 3\% of the initial feed (both
   organic and inorganic) was transported to the gas phase as aerosols.
   Large bubble-to-aerosol size ratios and visualization of significant
   late-time ejections in the pyrolyzing cellulose suggest the formation of
   film bubbles in addition to the previously discovered jet formation
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{Tin sulfides can exist in a variety of phases and polytypes due to the

   take the form of layered 2D structures that give rise to a wide host of

   phase, polytype, and thickness of tin sulfides is necessary to utilize
   this wide range of properties exhibited by the compound. This study
   reports on phase-selective growth of both hexagonal tin (IV) sulfide
   SnS2 and orthorhombic tin (II) sulfide SnS crystals with diameters of
   over tens of microns on SiO2 substrates through atmospheric pressure
   vapor-phase method in a conventional horizontal quartz tube furnace with
   SnO2 and S powders as the source materials. Detailed characterization of
   each phase of tin sulfide crystals is performed using various microscopy

Abstract = {{APOBEC3A (A3A) inhibits the replication of a range of viruses and
   transposons and might also play a role in carcinogenesis. It is a
   single-domain deaminase enzyme that interacts with single-stranded DNA
   (ssDNA) and converts cytidines to uridines within specific trinucleotide
   contexts. Although there is abundant information that describes the
   potential biological activities of A3A, the interplay between binding
   ssDNA and sequence-specific deaminase activity remains controversial.
   Using a single-molecule atomic force microscopy spectroscopy approach
   developed by Shlyakhtenko et al. {[}(2015) Sci. Rep. 5, 15648], we
   determine the stability of A3A in complex with different ssDNA
   sequences. We found that the strength of the complex is
   sequence-dependent, with more stable complexes formed with
   deaminase-specific sequences. A correlation between the deaminase
   activity of A3A and the complex strength was identified. The ssDNA
   binding properties of A3A and those for A3G are also compared and
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Signal transduction networks coordinate transcriptional programs
   activated by diverse extracellular stimuli, such as growth factors and
   cytokines. Cells receive multiple stimuli simultaneously, and mapping
   how activation of the integrated signaling network affects gene
   expression is a challenge. We stimulated colon adenocarcinoma cells with
   various combinations of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the
   growth factors insulin and epidermal growth factor (EGF) to investigate
   signal integration and transcriptional crosstalk. We quantitatively
   linked the proteomic and transcriptomic data sets by implementing a
   structured computational approach called tensor partial least squares
   regression. This statistical model accurately predicted transcriptional
   signatures from signaling arising from single and combined stimuli and
   also predicted time-dependent contributions of signaling events.
   Specifically, the model predicted that an early-phase, AKT-associated
   signal downstream of insulin repressed a set of transcripts induced by
   TNF. Through bioinformatics and cell-based experiments, we identified
   the AKT-repressed signal as glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3)-catalyzed
   phosphorylation of Ser37 on the long form of the transcription factor
   GATA6. Phosphorylation of GATA6 on Ser37 promoted its degradation,
   thereby preventing GATA6 from repressing transcripts that are induced by
   TNF and attenuated by insulin. Our analysis showed that predictive
   tensor modeling of proteomic and transcriptomic data sets can uncover
   pathway crosstalk that produces specific patterns of gene expression in
   cells receiving multiple stimuli.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{A heat assisted magnetic recording composite media with a
   superparamagnetic writing layer is proposed. The recording process is
   initiated in the write layer that is magnetically softer than the long
   term storage layer. Upon cooling, the composite structure copies the
   information from the writing layer to the lower Curie temperature (Tc)
   storage layer, e.g., doped FePt. The advantages include insensitivity to
   Tc variance in the storage layer, and thus the opportunity to
   significantly lower the FePt Tc without the resulting Tc distribution
   adversely affecting the performance. The composite structure has a small
   jitter within 0.1 nm of the grain size limit owing to the sharp
   transition width of the optimized superparamagnetic writing layer. The
   user density of the composite structure can reach 4.7 Tb/in:(2) for a
   Gaussian heat spot with a full-width-at-half-maximum of 30 nm, a 12 nm
   reader width, and an optimized bit length of 6 nm. Published by AIP

Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Quantitative characterization of thermal properties of nanorod (NR)
   arrays appears to be challenging due to the complex combination of high
   volume of air voids, anisotropy, and structural non-uniformity. This
   work investigates the structure-thermal property correlation of arrays
   consisting of either vertically aligned or slanted silicon dioxide
   (SiO2) NRs, fabricated by the dynamic shadowing growth technique. We
   apply the frequency-dependent time-domain thermoreflectance method to
   quantify the thermal properties of SiO2 NR arrays that may possess
   inhomogeneity along the depth direction. The effective thermal
   conductivities of four SiO2 NR array films and one reference capping
   layer for the SiO2 NR array are obtained. The impact of the structure on
   the effective thermal conductivities of the SiO2 NR array is discussed.
   The lowest effective thermal conductivity among all samples in this work
   is found to be 0.13 W m(-1) K-1 for the slanted NR array. We attribute
   the reduction in the effective thermal conductivity of the NR array to
   the discontinuous nature of SiO2 NRs, which reduces the density of the
   thermal transport channels and thus prevents heat flux from propagating
   downwards along the through-plane direction. The results from this work
   facilitate the potential applications of NR-array-based thermal
   insulators for micro-thermal devices. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Title = {{Silica ecosystem for synergistic biotransformation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Synergistical bacterial species can perform more varied and complex
   transformations of chemical substances than either species alone, but
   this is rarely used commercially because of technical difficulties in
   maintaining mixed cultures. Typical problems with mixed cultures on
   scale are unrestrained growth of one bacterium, which leads to
   suboptimal population ratios, and lack of control over bacterial spatial
   distribution, which leads to inefficient substrate transport. To address
   these issues, we designed and produced a synthetic ecosystem by
   co-encapsulation in a silica gel matrix, which enabled precise control
   of the microbial populations and their microenvironment. As a case
   study, two greatly different microorganisms: Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816
   and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 were encapsulated. NCIB 9816 can
   aerobically biotransform over 100 aromatic hydrocarbons, a feat useful
   for synthesis of higher value commodity chemicals or environmental
   remediation. In our system, NCIB 9816 was used for biotransformation of
   naphthalene (a model substrate) into CO2 and the cyanobacterium PCC 7942
   was used to provide the necessary oxygen for the biotransformation
   reactions via photosynthesis. A mathematical model was constructed to
   determine the critical cell density parameter to maximize oxygen
   production, and was then used to maximize the biotransformation rate of
   the system.}},

Title = {{Two-layer spin coating flow of Newtonian liquids: A computational study}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{180-189}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{Spin coating is the most commonly used method in industries to form
   coating films of desired thickness and functionality. In case of
   two-layer spin coating process, stratified layers of two immiscible
   liquids are deposited onto the substrate simultaneously, which spread
   and thin to form two-layer coating film of finite thickness. Questions
   concerning the effect of surface/interfacial tension on uniformity of
   these films and contact line evolution are relevant and need thorough
   investigation. Therefore, an axisymmetric model governing the flow of
   two-layer spin coating process is developed here. Liquids used for the
   study are assumed to be Newtonian and fully wetting. The contact line
   singularity is resolved using a precursor layer model and the governing
   equations are simplified using lubrication approximation. A Galerkin
   finite-element method (G/FEM) based scheme is developed to solve the
   resulting fourth order non-linear PDEs. Simulation results reveal that
   the fluid properties like ratio of the viscosity of upper layer fluid to
   lower layer and ratio of the upper gas-liquid surface tension to inner
   liquid-liquid interfacial tension have profound impact on the time
   evolution of the film profile, contact radius and shape of the capillary
   ridges. It is observed that a uniform two-layer film surrounded by thin
   single layer film is formed when the viscosity ratio is small. On the
   contrary, when viscosity ratio is large, a thin two-layer film
   surrounded by bulky capillary ridges is formed. Similarly, the results
   also show that sharpness of capillary ridge increases with decrease in
   the surface tension ratio. Further, it is found that increase in the
   precursor layer thickness increases the spreading rate, thereby making
   the film more uniform. Finally, the uniformity of the final two-layer
   film does not get affected by the initial volume of fluid present in the
   upper layer. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Meta-Analysis of EMT Datasets Reveals Different Types of EMT}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 3}},
Abstract = {{As a critical process during embryonic development, cancer progression
   and cell fate conversions, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has
   been extensively studied over the last several decades. To further
   understand the nature of EMT, we performed meta-analysis of multiple
   microarray datasets to identify the related generic signature. In this
   study, 24 human and 17 mouse microarray datasets were integrated to
   identify conserved gene expression changes in different types of EMT.
   Our integrative analysis revealed that there is low agreement among the
   list of the identified signature genes and three other lists in previous
   studies. Since removing the datasets with weakly-induced EMT from the
   analysis did not significantly improve the overlapping in the
   signature-gene lists, we hypothesized the existence of different types
   of EMT. This hypothesis was further supported by the grouping of 74
   human EMT-induction samples into five distinct clusters, and the
   identification of distinct pathways in these different clusters of EMT
   samples. The five clusters of EMT-induction samples also improves the
   understanding of the characteristics of different EMT types. Therefore,
   we concluded the existence of different types of EMT was the possible
   reason for its complex role in multiple biological processes.}},

   form. The cocrystal between carbamezepine and succinic acid (CBZ-SUC)
   exhibits a higher aqueous solubility than its dihydrate, which is the
   stable form of CBZ in water. Using this model system, we demonstrate an
   efficient and material-sparing tablet formulation screening approach
   enabled by intrinsic dissolution rate measurements. Three tablet
   formulations capable of stabilizing the cocrystal both under accelerated
   condition of 40 degrees C and 75\% RH and during dissolution were
   developed using three different polymers, Soluplus (R) (F-1), Kollidon
   VA/64 (F-2) and Hydroxypropyl methyl cellulose acetate succinate (F-3).
   When compared to a marketed product, Epitol (R) 200 mg tablets (F-0),
   drug release after 60 min from formulations F-1 (similar to 82\%), F-2
   (similar to 95\%) and F-3 (similar to 95\%) was all higher than that
   from Epitol (R) (79\%) in a modified simulated intestinal fluid. Studies
   in albino rabbits show correspondingly better bioavailability of F-1-F-3
   than Epitol.}},

Abstract = {{Solar thermochemical reactors to carry out the nonstoichiometric
   reduction and oxidation of cerium dioxide (ceria) to split water and
   carbon dioxide provide a pathway to store sunlight in a chemical fuel.
   One of the challenges in the design of these reactors is understanding
   the complex coupling of heat and mass transfer and redox chemistry. To
   elucidate this coupling, we present a three-dimensional, transient model
   of a recently developed prototype solar reactor that implements an
   isothermal, pressure-swing ceria redox cycle. Radiative transport is
   modeled by a hybrid Monte Carlo/finite volume approach and paired with
   the transport and chemical processes within a fixed bed of porous ceria
   particles. Morphology specific reaction rate coefficients for the
   gassolid reactions in ceria are extracted for the first time from global
   rate measurements in a bench-top reactor at 1773 K. Results demonstrate
   the interdependent spatial and temporal variations in temperature,
   species concentration and reaction rates, and provide insight on the
   effects of optical properties on reactor performance. For a solar input
   of 4.2 kW, the reactor achieves nearly isothermal cycling at 1791 K with
   carbon monoxide produced continuously at 3.6x10(-4) mol s(-1). At this
   temperature, global reaction rates are driven by advective mass
   transport rates and the intrinsic material thermodynamics. Predicted
   surface temperatures and fuel production rates compare favorably to
   measured data. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A Decade of Improved Lumber Drying Technology}},
Journal = {{CURRENT FORESTRY REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{106-118}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we comprehensively review the relevant literature
   published from 2005 to 2016, focused on lumber drying and provide a
   summary of where we feel future research will focus. Drying is a
   critical part of most wood products manufacturing process, and the
   methods used and proper control are key to achieving the appropriate
   production level, quality, and costs. While a combination of drying
   methods may be used, most lumber is dried in a kiln at some point in the
   process. The most common commercial kilns can be classified as
   conventional, high temperature, and vacuum; however, there continues to
   be some interest in solar and compression drying. While no new drying
   technologies have been proposed, work has continued on improving the
   existing methods. Control of the drying process varies with the type of
   kiln used, the species being dried and the temperatures used in the
   process; however, it usually involves some type of measurement of the
   moisture content of the wood being dried. The development of new methods
   for controlling the drying process focuses on new ways to measure
   moisture content or moisture content variation, temperature drop across
   the load, and drying stresses. While wood quality can be defined
   differently by its various users, for example, industrial or end users,
   certain aspects of quality remain constant across these groups, such as
   minimizing warp, checks, and splits, and discoloration, and maintaining
   or enhancing mechanical properties. New schedules have been proposed to
   increase drying rate and improve drying quality. Methods to reduce
   drying defects and improve its quality have focused mainly on mechanical
   restraint to prevent warp, better understanding of defect formation, and
   pre-treatments to speed up the drying process or reduce final moisture
   content variation. Finally, concerns regarding the environmental impacts
   of wood drying, most importantly the high energy demands and emissions,
   have increased in importance as concerns about sustainability and health
   issues become more mainstream.}},

Abstract = {{Models for predicting the probability of experiencing various health
   outcomes or adverse events over a certain time frame (e.g., having a
   heart attack in the next 5 years) based on individual patient
   characteristics are important tools for managing patient care.
   Electronic health data (EHD) are appealing sources of training data
   because they provide access to large amounts of rich individual-level
   data from present-day patient populations. However, because EHD are
   derived by extracting information from administrative and clinical
   databases, some fraction of subjects will not be under observation for
   the entire time frame over which one wants to make predictions; this
   loss to follow-up is often due to disenrollment from the health system.
   For subjects without complete follow-up, whether or not they experienced
   the adverse event is unknown, and in statistical terms the event time is
   said to be right-censored. Most machine learning approaches to the
   problem have been relatively ad hoc; for example, common approaches for
   handling observations in which the event status is unknown include (1)
   discarding those observations, (2) treating them as non-events, (3)
   splitting those observations into two observations: one where the event
   occurs and one where the event does not. In this paper, we present a
   general-purpose approach to account for right-censored outcomes using
   inverse probability of censoring weighting (IPCW). We illustrate how
   IPCW can easily be incorporated into a number of existing machine
   learning algorithms used to mine big health care data including Bayesian
   networks, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, and generalized additive
   models. We then show that our approach leads to better calibrated
   predictions than the three ad hoc approaches when applied to predicting
   the 5-year risk of experiencing a cardiovascular adverse event, using
   EHD from a large U.S. Midwestern healthcare system. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Acquiring an atomic-resolution compositional map of crystalline
   specimens has become routine practice, thus opening possibilities for
   extracting subatomic information from such maps. A key challenge for
   achieving subatomic precision is the improvement of signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) of compositional maps. Here, we report a simple and reliable
   solution for achieving high-SNR energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX)
   spectroscopy spectrum images for individual atomic columns. The method
   is based on standard cross-correlation aided by averaging of
   single-column EDX maps with modifications in the reference image. It
   produces EDX maps with minimal specimen drift, beam drift, and scan
   distortions. Step-by-step procedures to determine a self-consistent
   reference map with a discussion on the reliability, stability, and
   limitations of the method are presented here.}},

   tissue construct that could be scaled up to perform large-scale screens,

   cells to build larger tissues. We have developed an easy-to-use method
   to miniaturize protein-based tissue constructs that maintains the 3D in
   vitro environment, while alleviating several obstacles associated with
   larger avascular tissue constructs. In this study, we demonstrate that (
   i) cells can interact with the 3D environment both while encapsulated or
   while interacting only with the surface of the microtissues, ( ii)
   encapsulated cells are highly viable and, for the first time, ( iii)
   microtissues on this size scale (similar to 200 mu m) can be used to
   quantify cell contractility. This versatile platform should facilitate
   large-scale screens in 3D in vitro culture conditions for drug

Abstract = {{Mapping origin-destination (OD) network traffic is pivotal for network
   management and proactive security tasks. However, lack of sufficient
   flow-level measurements as well as potential anomalies pose major
   challenges towards this goal. Leveraging the spatiotemporal correlation
   of nominal traffic, and the sparse nature of anomalies, this paper
   brings forth a novel framework to map out nominal and anomalous traffic,
   which treats jointly important network monitoring tasks including
   traffic estimation, anomaly detection, and traffic interpolation. To
   this end, a convex program is first formulated with nuclear and - norm
   regularization to effect sparsity and low rank for the nominal and
   anomalous traffic with only the link counts and a small subset of
   OD-flow counts. Analysis and simulations confirm that the proposed
   estimator can exactly recover sufficiently low-dimensional nominal
   traffic and sporadic anomalies so long as the routing paths are
   sufficiently ``spread-out{''} across the network, and an adequate amount
   of flow counts are randomly sampled. The results offer valuable insights
   about data acquisition strategies and network scenaria giving rise to
   accurate traffic estimation. For practical networks where the
   aforementioned conditions are possibly violated, the inherent
   spatiotemporal traffic patterns are taken into account by adopting a
   Bayesian approach along with a bilinear characterization of the nuclear
   and norms. The resultant nonconvex program involves quadratic
   regularizers with correlation matrices, learned systematically from
   (cyclo) stationary historical data. Alternating-minimization based
   algorithms with provable convergence are also developed to procure the
   estimates. Insightful tests with synthetic and real Internet data
   corroborate the effectiveness of the novel schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of seizures is a difficult problem as the EEG patterns are
   not wide-sense stationary and change from seizure to seizure, electrode
   to electrode, and from patient to patient. This paper presents a novel
   patient-specific algorithm for prediction of seizures in epileptic
   patients from either one or two single-channel or bipolar channel
   intra-cranial or scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings with low
   hardware complexity. Spectral power features are extracted and their
   ratios are computed. For each channel, a total of 44 features including
   8 absolute spectral powers, 8 relative spectral powers and 28 spectral
   power ratios are extracted every two seconds using a 4-second window
   with a 50\% overlap. These features are then ranked and selected in a
   patient-specific manner using a two-step feature selection. Selected
   features are further processed by a second-order Kalman filter and then
   input to a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The algorithm
   is tested on the intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) from the Freiburg database and
   scalp EEG (sEEG) from the MIT Physionet database. The Freiburg database
   contains 80 seizures among 18 patients in 427 hours of recordings. The
   MIT EEG database contains 78 seizures from 17 children in 647 hours of
   recordings. It is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve a
   sensitivity of 100\% and an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.0324
   per hour for the iEEG (Freiburg) database and a sensitivity of 98.68\%
   and an average FPR of 0.0465 per hour for the sEEG (MIT) database. These
   results are obtained with leave-one-out cross-validation where the
   seizure being tested is always left out from the training set. The
   proposed algorithm also has a low complexity as the spectral powers can
   be computed using FFT. The area and power consumption of the proposed
   linear SVM are 2 to 3 orders of magnitude less than a radial basis
   function kernel SVM (RBF-SVM) classifier. Furthermore, the total energy
   consumption of a system using linear SVM is reduced by 8\% to 23\%
   compared to system using RBF-SVM.}},

Abstract = {{The Flash Translation Layer ( FTL) is a firmware layer inside NAND flash
   memory that allows existing disk-based applications to use it without
   any significant modifications. Since the FTL has a critical impact on
   the performance and reliability of flash-based storage, a variety of
   FTLs have been proposed. The existing FTLs, however, are designed to
   perform well for either a read intensive workload or a write intensive
   workload, not for both due to their internal address mapping schemes. To
   overcome this limitation, we propose a novel hybrid FTL scheme named
   Convertible Flash Translation Layer ( CFTL). CFTL is adaptive to data
   access patterns with the help of our unique hot data identification
   design that adopts multiple bloom filters. Thus, CFTL can dynamically
   switch its mapping scheme to either page-level mapping or block-level
   mapping to fully exploit the benefits of both schemes. In addition, we
   design a spatial locality-aware caching mechanism and adaptive cache
   partitioning to further improve CFTL performance. Consequently, both the
   adaptive switching scheme and the judicious caching mechanism empower
   CFTL to achieve good read and write performance. Our extensive
   evaluations demonstrate that CFTL outperforms existing FTLs. In
   particular, our specially designed caching mechanism remarkably improves
   the cache hit ratio, by an average of 2.4x, and achieves much higher hit
   ratios ( up to 8.4x) especially for random read intensive workloads.}},

Abstract = {{The expected rise of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) will lead to a
   significant additional demand on low voltage distribution systems, and
   PEVs can challenge power quality and reliability of power systems if
   their charging is not coordinated. The PEV aggregator, acting as an
   intermedium between customers and the grid operator, can solve the
   charging management problem effectively. In this study, a decentralized
   scheduling scheme of aggregators for PEV charging based on Lagrange
   Relaxation method is proposed. At the same time, a centralized model of
   aggregators is also formulated in the same situation in order to make
   comparisons with the proposed scheme. The two charging models are both
   aimed at maximizing the charging profit of PEV aggregators considering
   constraints including users' electricity demand, charging time,
   available capacity of distribution transformers, etc. A number of
   charging scenarios are simulated to evaluate the proposed method. The
   economic benefits, computational complexity and efficiency are compared
   and analyzed between the centralized charging and the decentralized
   charging. Simulation results verify that the decentralized charging
   strategy based on Lagrange Relaxation method gains charging profit close
   to the centralized charging yet is more efficient and realizable than
   the centralized charging.}},

Abstract = {{5-Fluorocytosine (FC) is a high-dose antifungal drug that challenges the
   development of a tablet product due to poor solid-state stability and
   tabletability. Using 2 pharmaceutically acceptable conjugate acid base
   (CAB) cocrystals of FC with HCl and acesulfame, we have developed
   commercially viable high loading FC tablets. The tablets were prepared
   by direct compression using nano-coated microcrystalline cellulose
   Avicel PH105 as a tablet binder, which provided both excellent
   tabletability and good flow-ability. Commercial manufacturability of
   formulations based on both CAB cocrystals was verified on a compaction
   simulator. The results from an expedited friability study were used to
   set the compaction force, which yielded tablets with sufficient
   mechanical strength and rapid tablet disintegration. This work
   demonstrates the potential value of CAB cocrystals in drug product

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a self-adaptive interactive navigation tool (SAINT),
   which is tailored for cloud-based vehicular traffic optimization in road
   networks. The legacy navigation systems make vehicles navigate toward
   their destination less effectively with individually optimal navigation
   paths rather than network-wide optimal navigation paths, particularly
   during rush hours. To the best of our knowledge, SAINT is the first
   attempt to investigate a self-adaptive interactive navigation approach
   through the interaction between vehicles and vehicular cloud. The
   vehicles report their navigation experiences and travel paths to the
   vehicular cloud so that the vehicular cloud can know real-time road
   traffic conditions and vehicle trajectories for better navigation
   guidance for other vehicles. With these traffic conditions and vehicle
   trajectories, the vehicular cloud uses a mathematical model to calculate
   road segment congestion estimation for global traffic optimization. This
   model provides each vehicle with a navigation path that has minimum
   traffic congestion in the target road network. Using the simulation with
   a realistic road network, it is shown that our SAINT outperforms the
   legacy navigation scheme, which is based on Dijkstra's algorithm with a
   real-time road traffic snapshot. On a road map of Manhattan in New York
   City, our SAINT can significantly reduce the travel delay during rush
   hours by 19\%.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to three-dimensionally interweave biological and functional
   materials could enable the creation of bionic devices possessing unique
   and compelling geometries, properties, and functionalities. Indeed,
   interfacing high performance active devices with biology could impact a
   variety of fields, including regenerative bioelectronic medicines, smart
   prosthetics, medical robotics, and human machine interfaces. Biology,
   from the molecular scale of DNA and proteins, to the macroscopic scale
   of tissues and organs, is three-dimensional, often soft and stretchable,
   and temperature sensitive. This renders most biological platforms
   incompatible with the fabrication and materials processing methods that
   have been developed and optimized for functional electronics, which are
   typically planar, rigid and brittle. A number of strategies have been
   developed to overcome these dichotomies. One particularly novel approach
   is the use of extrusion-based multi-material 3D printing, which is an
   additive manufacturing technology that offers a freeform fabrication
   strategy. This approach addresses the dichotomies presented above by (1)
   using 3D printing and imaging for customized, hierarchical, and
   interwoven device architectures; (2) employing nanotechnology as an
   enabling route for introducing high performance materials, with the
   potential for exhibiting properties not found in the bulk; and (3) 3D
   printing a range of soft and nanoscale materials to enable the
   integration of a diverse palette of high quality functional
   nanomaterials with biology. Further, 3D printing is a multi-scale
   platform, allowing for the incorporation of functional nanoscale inks,
   the printing of microscale features, and ultimately the creation of
   macroscale devices. This blending of 3D printing, novel nanomaterial
   properties, and `living' platforms may enable next-generation bionic
   systems. In this review, we highlight this synergistic integration of
   the unique properties of nanomaterials with the versatility of
   extrusion-based 3D printing technologies to interweave nanomaterials and
   fabricate novel bionic devices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper examines a general class of noisy matrix completion tasks,
   where the goal is to estimate a matrix from observations obtained at a
   subset of its entries, each of which is subject to random noise or
   corruption. Our specific focus is on settings where the matrix to be
   estimated is well-approximated by a product of two (a priori unknown)
   matrices, one of which is sparse. Such structural models-referred to
   here as sparse factor models-have been widely used, for example, in
   subspace clustering applications, as well as in contemporary sparse
   modeling and dictionary learning tasks. Our main theoretical
   contributions are estimation error bounds for sparsity-regularized
   maximum likelihood estimators for the problems of this form, which are
   applicable to a number of different observation noise or corruption
   models. Several specific implications are examined, including scenarios
   where observations are corrupted by additive Gaussian noise or additive
   heavier-tailed (Laplace) noise, Poisson-distributed observations, and
   highly quantized (e.g., 1 b) observations. We also propose a simple
   algorithmic approach based on the alternating direction method of
   multipliers for these tasks, and provide experimental evidence to
   support our error analyses.}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Multifunctional 3D microstructures have been extensively investigated
   for the development of new classes of electronic and optical devices.
   Here, functionalized, free-standing, hollow, 3D, dielectric (150 nm
   thick aluminum oxide) microcontainers with metal patterning on their
   surfaces are realized by an evolved self-assembly approach. To
   functionalize the 3D structure and use it as a device, metal patterns,
   arrays of split-ring resonators (SRRs) acting as metamaterials, are
   defined on the surface of the 3D dielectric microcontainers. The SRRs on
   all six facets of a given microcube show a resonant behavior in
   terahertz regimes. Since desired metal and semiconductor patterns can be
   incorporated onto surfaces of 3D dielectric microstructures, this
   self-assembly process can be harnessed in developing next-generation
   microdevices utilizing the numerous advantages of 3D configurations.}},

Pages = {{1595-1604}},

Abstract = {{Aims: Efficient manipulation of multiple regions within a genome can be
   improved by counter-selection approaches. In this work, we sought to
   develop a method to manipulate Azotobacter vinelandii using a
   counter-selection approach based on the presence of the pyrF gene.
   Methods and Results: A background uracil auxotroph of A. vinelandii was
   first constructed by deleting the pyrF gene coding
   orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase. The pyrF gene and promoter were
   also incorporated together with an antibiotic marker to create a
   selection and counter-selection cassette to shuttle into various
   plasmids. The constructed cassette could then be removed using a plasmid
   lacking the pyrF gene via counter-selection resulting from the
   production of 5-fluorouracil. The process could be repeated multiple
   times using the same procedure for selection and counter-selection.
   Following completion, the pyrF gene may be reintroduced to the genome in
   its original location, leaving a completed strain devoid of any
   antibiotic markers.
   Conclusions: Utilization of the pyrF gene for counter-selection is a
   powerful tool that can be used effectively to make multiple gene
   deletions in A. vinelandii.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: This study demonstrates the
   successful application of a counter-selection approach to yield
   markerless genetic modifications to A. vinelandii, which should be of
   interest for a range of applications in this important model bacterium.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: In myopathy patients, it is useful to measure skeletal
   muscle forces. Conventional methods require voluntary muscle activation,
   which can be unreliable. We evaluated a device for nonvoluntary force
   assessment. Methods: We tested 8 patients (unknown myopathy n = 2,
   inflammatory myopathy, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy,
   mitochondrial myopathy, dysferlinopathy, multi-minicore disease,
   Becker-Kiener muscular dystrophy, n = 1 each). Isometric twitch torques
   of ankle dorsiflexors were measured after fibular nerve stimulation.
   Results: Six patients had decreased torques vs. 8 controls (men: median
   Newton-meter 1.6 vs. 5.7, women: 0.2 vs. 3.9, both P < 0.0001). Values
   correlated with Manual Muscle Test results (r = 0.73; r(2) = 0.53; P <
   0.0001). In weak dorsiflexors, torque could be measured despite lower
   signal-to-noise ratios. In 2 patients with hypertrophy, we measured
   increased torques. Conclusions: Nonvoluntary muscle force assessment can
   be used in patients with myopathies, and values correlate with voluntary
   forces determined by traditional methods.}},

   volume ratio of the alpha `'-Fe16N2 phase reaches 70\% after 60 h of
   milling with a ball mill rotation speed of 600 rpm in planetary mode.
   Its saturation magnetization (M-s) is 210 emu g(-1) and the coercivity
   is 854 Oe at room temperature. After ball milling, shock compaction is
   used to compact the milled powder sample into a bulk magnet. Its
   magnetic properties and crystalline structure are characterized.
   Overall, the ball milling-based approach can be used to prepare alpha
   `'-Fe16N2 magnets at an industrial production level.}},

Abstract = {{As a potential flexible substrate for flexible electronics, a
   polymer-sandwiched ultra-thin silicon platform is studied. SU-8
   photoresist coated on the silicon membrane improves its flexibility as
   shown by an ANSYS simulation. Using the plasma enhanced chemical vapor
   deposited SiO2/Si3N4 composite film as an etching mask, a 4 `'
   silicon-(100) wafer is thinned to 26 mu m without rupture in a 30 wt.\%
   KOH solution. The thinned wafer is coated on both sides with 20 mu m of
   SU-8 photoresist and is cut into strips. Then the strips are bent by a
   caliper to measure its bending radius. A sector model of bending
   deformation is adopted to estimate the radius of curvature. The
   determined minimal bending radius of the polymer-sandwiched ultra-thin
   silicon layer is no more than 3.3 mm. The fabrication process of this
   sandwich structure can be used as a post-fabrication process for high
   performance flexible electronics.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and tip-enhanced Raman
   spectroscopy (TERS) have shown great promise in the detection and
   analysis of trace analytes throughout numerous fields of study. Both
   SERS and TERS utilize nanoscale plasmonic surface features to increase
   the intensity of observed Raman signals by many orders of magnitude
   (>10(8)). One of the major factors limiting the wider and more routine
   implementation of the enhanced Raman phenomena is in the difficulty of
   forming consistent and reliable plasmonic substrates with well-defined
   ``hot-spots{''}. We address this limitation by designing a platform that
   can be used for both SERS and TEAS. The presented technique allows for
   rapid, controlled, ``on-demand{''}, and reversible formation of a SERS
   substrate using dielectrophoresis at the end of a nanoscale pipet. This
   drives gold nanoparticles in solution to concentrate and self-assemble
   at the tip of the pipet, where analytes can be detected effectively
   using SERS. An additional benefit of the platform is that the nanopipet
   containing a nanopore can be used for detection of individual
   nanoparticles facilitated by the added enhancement originating from the
   nanopipet tip enhanced signal. Complementing the experimental results
   are simulations highlighting the mechanism for SERS substrate formation
   and TERS detection.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new technique to engineer metallic interfaces to produce
   sharp tips with smooth curved surfaces and variable tip angles, as well
   as ridges with arbitrary contour shapes, all of which can be integrated
   with grating couplers for applications in plasmonics and nanophotonics.
   We combine template stripping, a nanofabrication scheme, with atomic
   layer deposition (ALD) to produce the ultrasharp nanoscale tips and
   wedges using only conventional photolithography. Conformal ALD coating
   of insulators over silicon trench molds of various shapes reduces their
   widths to make nanoscale features without high-resolution lithography.
   Along with a metal deposition and template stripping, this
   size-reduction scheme can mass-produce narrow and ultrasharp (<10 nm
   radius of curvature) metallic wedges and tips over an entire 4 in.
   wafer. This size-reduction scheme can create metallic tips out of
   arbitrary trench patterns that have smooth curved surfaces to facilitate
   efficient adiabatic nanofocusing which will benefit applications in
   near-field optical spectroscopy, plasmonic waveguides, particle
   trapping, hot-electron plasmonics, and nonlinear optics.}},

Abstract = {{Mesoporous metal carbides are of particular interest as catalysts for a

   a nanocasting approach coupled with a simultaneous
   decomposition/carburization process under a continuous methane flow. The
   as-synthesized mesoporous Mo2C and W2C have three dimensionally ordered
   porous structures, large surface areas (70-90 m(2) g(-1)), and
   crystalline walls. In vapor-phase anisole hydrodeoxygenation (HDO)
   reactions, they exhibited turnover frequencies of approximately 9 and 2
   x 10(-4) mol molco(-1) s(-1), respectively, at relatively low reaction
   temperatures (423-443 K) and ambient hydrogen pressures. Notably, the

Abstract = {{Due to limitations on the availability of rare earth elements it is
   imperative that new high energy product rare earth free permanent magnet
   materials are developed for the next generation of energy systems. One
   promising low cost permanent magnet candidate for a high energy magnet
   is alpha aEuro(3)-Fe16N2, whose giant magnetic moment has been predicted
   to be well above any other from conventional first principles
   calculations. Despite its great promise, the alpha aEuro(3) phase is
   metastable; making synthesis of the pure phase difficult, resulting in
   less than ideal magnetic characteristics. This instability gives way to
   a slew of possible secondary phases (i.e. alpha-Fe, Fe2O3, Fe8N, Fe4N,
   etc.) whose concentrations are difficult to detect by conventional x-ray
   diffraction. Here we show how high resolution neutron diffraction and
   polarized neutron reflectometry can be used to extract the phase
   concentration ratio of the giant magnetic phase from ultra-small powder
   sample sizes (similar to 0.1 g) and thin films. These studies have led
   to the discovery of promising fabrication methods for both homogeneous
   thin films, and nanopowders containing the highest reported to date (>
   95\%) phase concentrations of room temperature stable alpha
   aEuro(3)-Fe16N2.}},

Abstract = {{The self-assembly of 3D nanostructures is a promising technology for the
   fabrication of next generation nanodevices and the exploration of novel
   phenomena. However, the present techniques for assembly of 3D
   nanostructures are invisible and have to be done without physical
   contact, which bring great challenges in controlling the shapes with
   nanoscale precision. This situation leads to an extremely low yield of
   self-assembly, especially in 3D nanostructures built with metal and
   semiconductor materials. Here, an in situ self-assembly process using a
   focused ion beam (FIB) microscopy system has been demonstrated to
   realize 3D polyhedral nanostructures from 2D multiple pieces. An excited
   ion beam in the FIB microscopy system offers not only a visualization of
   the nanoscale self-assembly process but also the necessary energy for
   inducing the process. Because the beam energy that induces the
   self-assembly can be precisely adjusted while monitoring the status of
   the self-assembly, it is possible to control the self-assembly process
   with sub-10 nm scale precision, resulting in the realization of diverse
   3D nanoarchitectures with a high yield. This approach will lead to
   state-of-the-art applications utilizing properties of 3D nanostructures
   in diverse fields.}},

   Persistent Atrial Fibrillation}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Highest dominant-frequency (DF) drivers maintaining atrial
   fibrillation (AF) activities are effective ablation targets for
   restoring sinus rhythms in patients. This study aims to investigate
   whether AF drivers with highest activation rate can be noninvasively
   localized by means of a frequency-based cardiac electrical imaging (CEI)
   technique, which may aid in the planning of ablation strategy and the
   investigation of the underlying mechanisms of AF. Method: A total of
   seven out of 13 patients were recorded with spontaneous paroxysmal or
   persistent AF and analyzed. The biatrial DF maps were reconstructed by
   coupling 5-s BSPM with CT-determined patient geometry. The CEI results
   were compared with ablation sites and DFs found from BSPMs. Results: CEI
   imaged left-to-right maximal frequency gradient (7.42 +/- 0.66 Hz versus
   5.85 +/- 1.2 Hz, LA versus RA, p < 0.05) in paroxysmal AF patients.
   Patients with persistent AF were imaged with a loss of the intrachamber
   frequency gradient and a dispersion of the fast sources in both
   chambers. CEI was able to capture the AF behaviors, which were
   characterized by short-term stability, dynamic transition, and spatial
   repetition of the highest DF sites. The imaged highest DF sites were
   consistent with ablation sites in patients studied. Conclusions: The
   frequency-based CEI allows localization of AF drivers with highest DF
   and characterization of the spatiotemporal frequency behaviors,
   suggesting the possibility for individualizing treatment strategy and
   advancing understanding of the underlying AF mechanisms. Significance:
   The establishment of noninvasive imaging techniques localizing AF
   drivers would facilitate management of this significant cardiac
   arrhythmia.}},

Abstract = {{Carboxy-telechelic polyolefin prepolymers were synthesized via
   ring-opening metathesis polymerization of 3-ethyl-lcydooctene in the
   presence of maleic acid. Following hydrogenation these difunctional
   prepolymers were cross-linked with a trifunctional aziridine in the
   presence of fumed silica or carbon black fillers to yield polyolefin
   elastomers with significantly enhanced mechanical properties as compared
   to the unfilled versions. The tensile strength, modulus, and tear
   strength of the elastomers can be tuned by changing the filler type and
   the total filler content. Further study on the reinforcing mechanism
   suggests that both the polymer filler interactions and the filler filler
   interactions play key roles in the mechanical property enhancements.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives The aim of this study was to develop a reliable and
   repeatable method of inducing focal middle cerebral artery occlusion
   (MCAo) in rats without ligation of the external carotid artery (ECA),
   while reducing the risk of subarachnoid hemorrhage.
   Methods We prototyped microwires with different diameters (0.0120 inch,
   0.0115 inch, 0.0110 inch), materials, and construction methods
   (coil-on-core, extruded polymer jacket-on-core). Under fluoroscopic
   guidance and using femoral artery access, the microwires were navigated
   into the internal carotid artery of male Wistar rats (n=50, weight 376
   +/- 64 g) to induce MCAo for 1 or 2 h. We performed neurological
   assessments at baseline, and at 3, 24, 72, and 168 h after MCAo. MRI
   measurements were performed on a 9.4 T scanner at 1 and 7 days
   post-injury.
   Results The 0.0115 inch microwire with polymer jacket-on-core provided
   the most successful outcome. At 1 and 7 days post-injury, we observed
   similar infarction volumes for 1 and 2 h MCAo in the MRI study.
   Infarcted lesion volumes in both MCAo groups were significantly reduced
   at 7 days compared with 1 day post-injury. The trend in longitudinal
   changes for the scores of different neurological assessments was
   confirmed to be significant after the injury, but both groups showed a
   similar trend of neurological deficits over the course of the study.
   Conclusions We have developed a reliable and repeatable MCAo method in
   rats, allowing for precise occlusion of the MCA under direct
   fluoroscopic visualization without alteration of the cerebral
   hemodynamics associated with ECA ligation. The custom designed microwire
   can also be sized for targeted focal ischemia in larger animals.}},

Abstract = {{Consider the problem of minimizing the expected value of a cost function
   parameterized by a random variable. The classical sample average
   approximation method for solving this problem requires minimization of
   an ensemble average of the objective at each step, which can be
   expensive. In this paper, we propose a stochastic successive upper-bound
   minimization method (SSUM) which minimizes an approximate ensemble
   average at each iteration. To ensure convergence and to facilitate
   computation, we require the approximate ensemble average to be a locally
   tight upper-bound of the expected cost function and be easily optimized.
   The main contributions of this work include the development and analysis
   of the SSUM method as well as its applications in linear transceiver
   design for wireless communication networks and online dictionary
   learning. Moreover, using the SSUM framework, we extend the classical
   stochastic (sub-)gradient method to the case of minimizing a nonsmooth
   nonconvex objective function and establish its convergence.}},

Abstract = {{The shift toward sustainable electricity systems is one of the grand
   challenges of the 21st century. Decentralized production from renewable
   sources, electric mobility, and related advances are at odds with
   traditional power systems where central, large-scale generation of
   electricity follows inelastic consumer demand. Information systems
   innovations can enable new forms of dynamic electricity trading that
   leverage real-time consumption information and that use price signals to
   incentivize sustainable consumption behaviors. However, the best designs
   for these innovations, and the societal implications of different design
   choices, are largely unclear. We are addressing these challenges through
   the Power Trading Agent Competition (Power TAC), a competitive gaming
   platform on which numerous research groups now jointly devise,
   benchmark, and improve IS-based solutions to the sustainable electricity
   challenge. Based on the Power TAC community's results, we give
   preliminary empirical evidence for the efficacy of competitive gaming
   platforms, and for the community's contributions toward resolving the
   sustainable electricity challenge.}},

Volume = {{255}},
Pages = {{18-26}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Lakshtanov et al. (2007) showed that incorporation of aluminum and some
   water into SiO2 significantly reduces the post-stishovite transition
   pressure in SiO2. This discovery suggested that the ferroelastic
   post-stishovite transition in subducted MORB crust could be the source
   of reflectors/scatterers with low shear velocities observed in the mid
   to upper lower mantle. A few years later, a similar effect was observed
   in anhydrous Al-bearing silica. In this paper, we show by first
   principles, static calculations and by molecular dynamics using
   inter-atomic potentials that hydrogen bonds and hydrogen mobility play a
   crucial role in lowering the post-stishovite transition pressure. A
   cooperative redistribution of hydrogen atoms is the main mechanism
   responsible for the transition pressure reduction in hydrous aluminous
   stishovite. The effect is enhanced by increasing hydrogen concentration.
   This perspective suggests a potential relationship between the depth of
   seismic scatterers and the water content in stishovite. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{We present here some important results investigating aluminum as an
   effective surface dopant for increased oxidation resistance of zircaloy
   nuclear fuel cladding. At first, the transport behavior of aluminum into
   reactor grade zircaloy was studied using simple diffusion couples at
   temperatures greater than 770 K. The experiments revealed the formation
   of tens of microns thick graded Zr-Al layers. The activation energy of
   aluminum in zircaloy was found to be similar to 175 kJ/mol (similar to
   1.8 eV), indicating the high mobility of aluminum in zircaloy.
   Subsequently, aluminum sputter-coated zircaloy coupons were heat-treated
   to achieve surface doping and form compositionally graded layers. These
   coupons were then tested in steam environments at 1073 and 1273 K. The
   microstructure of the as-fabricated and steam-corroded specimens was
   compared to those of pure zircaloy control specimens. Analysis of data
   revealed that aluminum effectively competed with zircaloy for oxygen up
   until 1073 K blocking oxygen penetration, with no traces of large scale
   spalling, indicating mechanically stable interfaces and surfaces. At the
   highest steam test temperatures, aluminum was observed to segregate from
   the Zr-Al alloy under layers and migrate to the surface forming discrete
   clusters. Although this is perceived as an extremely desirable
   phenomenon, in the current experiments, oxygen was observed to penetrate
   into the zirconium-rich under layers, which could be attributed to
   formation of surface defects such as cracks in the surface alumina
   layers.}},

Title = {{Robust synthesis for linear parameter varying systems using integral
   quadratic constraints}},
Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{68}},
Pages = {{111-118}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A robust synthesis algorithm is developed for a class of uncertain,
   linear parameter varying (LPV) systems. The uncertain system is
   described as an interconnection of a nominal LPV system and a block
   structured uncertainty. The nominal part is a ``gridded{''} LPV system
   with state matrices that are arbitrary functions of the parameter. The
   input/output behavior of the uncertainty is described by integral
   quadratic constraints (IQCs). The robust synthesis problem leads to a
   non-convex optimization. The proposed algorithm is a coordinate-wise
   descent similar to the well-known DK iteration for mu synthesis. It
   alternates between an LPV synthesis step and an IQC analysis step. Both
   steps can be efficiently solved as semidefinite programs. The derivation
   of the synthesis algorithm is less obvious for LPV systems as compared
   to its LTI counterpart due to the lack of a valid frequency response
   interpretation. The main contribution is the construction of the
   iterative synthesis algorithm using time domain dissipation inequalities
   and a scaled system analogous to that appearing in mu synthesis. It is
   shown that the proposed algorithm ensures that the robust performance is
   non-increasing at each iteration step. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method is demonstrated on a simple numerical example. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Although many compounds have been approved for the treatment of human
   immunodeficiency type-1 (HIV-1) infection, additional anti-HIV-1 drugs
   (particularly those belonging to new drug classes) are still needed due
   to issues such as long-term drug-associated toxicities, transmission of
   drug-resistant variants, and development of multi-class resistance.
   Lethal mutagenesis represents an antiviral strategy that has not yet
   been clinically translated for HIV-1 and is based on the use of small
   molecules to induce excessive levels of deleterious mutations within the
   viral genome. Here, we show that 5-azacytidine (5-aza-C), a
   ribonucleoside analog that induces the lethal mutagenesis of HIV-1, and
   multiple inhibitors of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase (RNR)
   interact in a synergistic fashion to more effectively reduce the
   infectivity of HIV-1. In these drug combinations, RNR inhibitors failed
   to significantly inhibit the conversion of 5-aza-C to
   5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, suggesting that 5-aza-C acts primarily as a
   deoxyribonucleoside even in the presence of RNR inhibitors. The
   mechanism of antiviral synergy was further investigated for the
   combination of 5-aza-C and one specific RNR inhibitor, resveratrol, as
   this combination improved the selectivity index of 5-aza-C to the
   greatest extent. Antiviral synergy was found to be primarily due to the
   reduced accumulation of reverse transcription products rather than the
   enhancement of viral mutagenesis. To our knowledge, these observations
   represent the first demonstration of antiretroviral synergy between a
   ribonucleoside analog and RNR inhibitors, and encourage the development
   of additional ribonucleoside analogs and RNR inhibitors with improved
   antiretroviral activity. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Gas-phase biofilters offer effective pollution control for agricultural
   effluents, but a better understanding of microbial communities
   responsible for capture and degradation is needed to improve process
   control. In this study, we developed a wood bait and optimized microbial
   biofilm sampling for monitoring microbial biomarkers (microbial C,
   ergosterol, DNA) in a full-scale biofilter. Results demonstrated that
   targeting biofilm dynamics required removing the biofilm from the wood
   substrates prior to biomarker extraction. We identified a sampling
   threshold for these biofilms of >= 100 mg for accurate and low
   variability biomarker measurement, a threshold that can inform analyses
   in other systems or using other approaches (i.e. DNA sequencing). Using
   this approach in a full-scale biofilter revealed that the fungal
   contribution (as ergosterol) to total microbial biomass was greatest in
   the most desiccation-prone area of the biofilter. This observation is
   in-line with results from previous lab-scale studies and could be due,
   in part, to connectivity between fungal hyphae growing in biofilms and
   the wood baits, shown by con focal microscopy. This work provides a
   targeted sampling strategy for microbial biofilms in gas-phase
   biofiltration, adaptable to other pollution control bioreactors and that
   can be used to study microbial community dynamics in full-scale systems.

Abstract = {{Consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink multi-user
   channel. A well-studied problem in such a system is the design of linear
   beamformers for power minimization with the quality of service (QoS)
   constraints. The most representative algorithms for solving this class
   of problems are the so-called minimum mean square error
   (MMSE)-second-order cone programming (SOCP) algorithm {[}Visotksy and
   Madhow, ``Optimum Beamforming Using Transmit Antenna Arrays,{''} Proc.
   IEEE Veh. Technol. Conf., May 1999, vol. 1, pp. 851-856], {[}Wong,
   Zheng, and Ng, ``Convergence Analysis of Downlink MIMO Antenna System
   Using Second-Order Cone Programming,{''} Proc. 62nd IEEE Veh. Technol.
   Conf., Sep. 2005, pp. 492-496] and the uplink-downlink duality (UDD)
   algorithm {[}Codreanu, Tolli, Juntti, and Latva-Aho, ``Joint Design of
   Tx-Rx Beamformers in MIMO Downlink Channel,{''} IEEE Trans. Signal
   Process., vol. 55, no. 9, pp. 4639-4655, Sep. 2007]. The former is based
   on alternating optimization of the transmit and receive beamformers;
   while the latter is based on the well-known uplink-dowlink duality
   theory. Despite their wide applicability, the convergence to
   Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solutions of both algorithms is still open in
   the literature. In this paper, we rigorously establish the convergence
   of these algorithms for QoS-constrained power minimization (QCPM)
   problem with both single stream and multiple streams per user cases. Key
   to our analysis is the development and analysis of a new MMSE-DUAL
   algorithm, which connects the MMSE-SOCP and the UDD algorithm. Our
   numerical experiments show that 1) all these algorithms can almost
   always reach points with the same objective value irrespective of
   initialization and 2) the MMSE-SOCP/MMSE-DUAL algorithm works well while
   the UDD algorithm may fail with an infeasible initialization.}},

Abstract = {{We report the results of experiments using high-resolution imaging and
   digital analysis of transient frost growth to obtain quantitative
   information on frost thickness. The measurement technique provides
   faster data acquisition and much higher accuracy than traditional
   approaches. An empirical model of frost growth that captures the fast
   and slow growth periods is developed based on this data. The key
   physical and correlating parameter is the ratio of sensible heat
   transfer-to-total heat transfer, and the growth rate varies inversely
   with this ratio. The resulting correlation faithfully captures measured
   growth rates across a wide spectrum of frosting conditions and gives
   better predictive capability than that of existing correlations. The
   present model eliminates the need for specifics of the experimental
   apparatus and test surface as factors in prediction, as well as the
   necessity of measuring the frost-air interface temperature.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: The BLUS (Basic Laparoscopic Urologic Skills) consortium sought
   to address the construct validity of BLUS tasks and the wider problem of
   accurate, scalable and affordable skill evaluation by investigating the
   concordance of 2 novel candidate methods with faculty panel scores,
   those of automated motion metrics and crowdsourcing.
   Materials and Methods: A faculty panel of surgeons (5) and anonymous
   crowdworkers blindly reviewed a randomized sequence of a representative
   sample of 24 videos (12 pegboard and 12 suturing) extracted from the
   BLUS validation study (454) using the GOALS (Global Objective Assessment
   of Laparoscopic Skills) survey tool with appended pass-fail anchors via
   the same web based user interface. Pre-recorded motion metrics (tool
   path length, jerk cost etc) were available for each video. Cronbach's
   alpha, Pearson's R and ROC with AUC statistics were used to evaluate
   concordance between continuous scores, and as pass-fail criteria among
   the 3 groups of faculty, crowds and motion metrics.
   Results: Crowdworkers provided 1,840 ratings in approximately 48 hours,
   60 times faster than the faculty panel. The inter-rater reliability of
   mean expert and crowd ratings was good (alpha = 0.826). Crowd score
   derived pass-fail resulted in 96.9\% AUC (95\% CI 90.3-100; positive
   predictive value 100\%, negative predictive value 89\%). Motion metrics
   and crowd scores provided similar or nearly identical concordance with
   faculty panel ratings and pass-fail decisions.
   Conclusions: The concordance of crowdsourcing with faculty panels and
   speed of reviews is sufficiently high to merit its further investigation
   alongside automated motion metrics. The overall agreement among faculty,
   motion metrics and crowdworkers provides evidence in support of the
   construct validity for 2 of the 4 BLUS tasks.}},

Volume = {{33}},
Number = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Phase separation of trehalose during freeze-drying could render it
   ineffective as a lyoprotectant. The bulking agent, mannitol, on the
   other hand, should crystallize readily upon freezing. It is therefore
   imperative to understand the mutual interaction of these sugars during
   freezing to ensure preservation of the API during freeze-drying.
   We investigated the effect of mannitol to trehalose ratio (R) on the
   crystallization behavior of both solutes using Differential Scanning
   Calorimetry, X-Ray Crystallography and FTIR Spectrosopy during
   controlled freezing and annealing.
   When R = 1, crystallization of both mannitol (as hemihydrate) and
   trehalose (as alpha-anhydrate) were observed. When R a parts per
   thousand yenaEuro parts per thousand 1, extent of mannitol
   crystallization was directly proportional to the value of R. When R < 1,
   trehalose completely suppressed mannitol crystallization. At R > 1, the
   freeze concentrate was heterogeneous and characterized by two glass
   transitions - the lower temperature transition (T-g{''}) attributed to
   systems containing ``extra{''} unfrozen water. When heated above
   T-g{''}, crystallization of mannitol and the associated unfrozen water
   resulted in T-g' (glass transition temperature of the
   freeze-concentrate).
   R and not the total solute concentration, dictates the composition of
   the freeze concentrate as well as the physical stability of the
   excipients.}},

   without considering the impact of wake effects on nearby turbines. Wind
   plant control concepts aim to increase overall wind plant performance by

   boundary layer}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{653-661}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Asymmetric liquid liquid droplet heating mechanisms differ from the more
   commonly studied and better understood symmetric liquid gas mechanisms.
   In this work, we simulate two-dimensional low Weber number droplet
   heating in developing low Reynolds number liquid boundary layers. Of
   particular interest are the influences of Weber, Prandtl, and Reynolds
   number magnitudes on the system evolution. We perform simulations with a
   coupled Eulerian Lagrangian interface capturing methodology - the
   Lagrangian volume of fluid - alongside an Eulerian solver for the Navier
   Stokes equations that provides the spatial and temporal evolution of the
   temperature and velocity fields for the droplet and the surrounding
   fluid. Our results show droplet rolling induced by the velocity boundary
   layer modifies the temperature field in and around the droplet.
   Conduction negates the thermal influence of rolling in low Prandtl
   number droplets, but modifies the continuous phase temperature field.
   The Magnus force separates the droplets from the heated surface,
   decreasing their heating rate. These results establish the fundamentals
   of asymmetric liquid liquid droplet heating in developing boundary
   layers: it is necessary to include the Magnus force in physically
   representative near-wall droplet heating models, and resolution of
   near-droplet temperature gradients may be necessary in situations with
   temperature dependent interface processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Buckling behavior of carbon nanotubes under bending: From ripple to kink}},
Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{102}},
Pages = {{224-235}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{This paper elucidates the buckling behavior of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)
   under bending. CNTs are modeled as continuous thin-wall circular tubes,
   and their buckling is governed by equations that take into account of
   the sectional Brazier effect and non-uniform structural deformation. The
   CNT governing equations (fourth-order ordinary differential nonlinear
   equations with integral conditions) are solved by introducing a
   continuation algorithm. In addition, the buckling behavior of CNTs under
   bending is simulated with objective molecular dynamics (OMD). The
   atomistic simulations are used to verify the continuum results. We show
   that there exist low- and high-strain phases during the bending process
   of CNTs, and the transition in between may divide the whole bending
   process into three stages: low-curvature stage, mixed-curvature stage
   and high-curvature stage. Ripples are generated on the CNT surfaces
   before the formation of kinks. Compared to single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs),
   hydrogen-filled CNTs have a longer mixed-strain stage owing to the
   presence of internal pressure, and are therefore more inclined to
   exhibit a ripple morphology. Our results offer better understanding of
   the buckling behavior of CNTs, and may open up new opportunities for the
   design and applications of novel CNT-based nanoelectronics. (C) 2016

Journal = {{CARBON}},

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The formation of an aerogel-like sock is important to the floating
   catalyst method of synthesizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs). The sock, a
   term coined by Alan Windle, is an assembly of the individual
   electrostatically assembled nanotubes synthesized in the reactor. The
   coherency of this sock helps form the yarn or sheet. In this study, sock
   formation is investigated by controlling the feedstock type, injection
   rate, and carrier gas flow rate. A convection vortex has been
   identified, possibly for the first time, in the floating catalyst
   method. A convection vortex model is proposed to explain the sock
   formation. The sock morphology is found to be strongly affected by the
   carrier gas flowrate, where too high gas flowrate reduces the
   concentration of CNTs in the reactor resulting a failure in the sock
   formation. The dynamic behavior of the sock is explained by a web-shell
   structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   bioenergy production, bio-remediation and production of high-value
   bioactive compounds, but harvesting microalgae is a major bottleneck in
   the algae based processes. The objective of this research is to mimic
   the growth of natural lichen and develop a novel biofilm platform
   technology using filamentous fungi and microalgae to form a lichen type
   of biofilm ``mycoalgae{''} in a supporting polymer matrix.
   Results: The possibility of co-existence of Chlorella vulgaris with
   various fungal cultures was tested to identify the best strain
   combination for high algae harvest efficiency. The effect of different
   matrices for cell attachment and biofilm formation, cell surface
   characterization of mycoalgae biofilm, kinetics of the process with
   respect to the algaefungi cell distribution and total biomass production
   was studied. Mycoalgae biofilm with algae attachment efficiency of 99.0
   \% and above was achieved in a polymer-cotton composite matrix with
   glucose concentration of 2 g/L in the growth medium and agitation
   intensity of 150 rpm at 27 degrees C. The total biomass in the
   co-culture with the selected strain combination (Mucor sp. and Chlorella
   sp.) was higher than the axenic cultures of fungi and algae at the
   conditions tested.
   Conclusions: The results show that algae can be grown with complete
   attachment to a bio-augmenting fungal surface and can be harvested
   readily as a biofilm for product extraction from biomass. Even though,
   interaction between heterotrophic fungi and phototrophic algae was
   investigated in solid media after prolonged contact in a report, this
   research is the first of its kind in developing an artificial lichen
   type biofilm called ``mycoalgae{''} biofilm completely attached on a
   matrix in liquid cultures. The mycoalgae biofilm based processes,
   propounds the scope for exploring new avenues in the bio-production
   industry and bioremediation.}},

Title = {{Continuity of Monolayer-Bilayer Junctions for Localization of Lipid Raft
   Microdomains in Model Membranes}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{We show that the selective localization of cholesterol-rich domains and
   associated ganglioside receptors prefer to occur in the monolayer across
   continuous monolayer-bilayer junctions (MBJs) in supported lipid
   membranes. For the MBJs, glass substrates were patterned with
   poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) oligomers by thermally-assisted contact
   printing, leaving behind 3 nm-thick PDMS patterns. The hydrophobicity of
   the transferred PDMS patterns was precisely tuned by the stamping
   temperature. Lipid monolayers were formed on the PDMS patterned surface
   while lipid bilayers were on the bare glass surface. Due to the
   continuity of the lipid membranes over the MBJs, essentially free
   diffusion of lipids was allowed between the monolayer on the PDMS
   surface and the upper leaflet of the bilayer on the glass substrate. The
   preferential localization of sphingomyelin, ganglioside GM1 and
   cholesterol in the monolayer region enabled to develop raft microdomains
   through coarsening of nanorafts. Our methodology provides a simple and
   effective scheme of non-disruptive manipulation of the chemical
   landscape associated with lipid phase separations, which leads to more
   sophisticated applications in biosensors and as cell culture substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Up to the present, most work on the use of reclaimed asphalt pavement
   (RAP) has been empirical in nature. Very recent advances have
   demonstrated that finite-element techniques can be effectively used for
   modelling asphalt mixing drums in order to optimise the relative
   proportions of new and recycled materials and to determine the amount of
   time required to achieve full melting inside of the drum. A necessary
   prerequisite for the modelling is a definitive knowledge of the thermal
   conductivities of RAP and its components. This need motivated the
   present experimental work which encompassed RAP particles, RAP particles
   with the asphalt binder removed, and pure asphalt binder of different
   degrees of ageing. Also evaluated were taconite tailings, residual rock
   from the processing of iron-containing ore, and sand. The tailings have
   been mentioned as a candidate aggregate. The conductivity results for
   the solid media were related to three metrics: (a) the size ranges of
   the solids, (b) the density of the sample as a whole and (c) the
   porosity of the sample. All of the conductivity results for the
   investigated solid media fell in the range from 17 to 30W/m degrees C.
   The measured conductivities of the binder ranged from 0.17 to 0.19W/m
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{In femtosecond ultrafast electron microscopy (UEM) experiments, the
   initial excitation period is composed of spatiotemporal overlap of the
   temporally commensurate pump photon pulse and probe photoelectron
   packet. Generation of evanescent near-fields at the nanostructure
   specimens produces a dispersion relation that enables coupling of the
   photons (h omega = 2.4 eV, for example) and freely propagating electrons
   (200 keV, for example) in the near-field. Typically, this manifests as
   discrete peaks occurring at integer multiples (n) of the photon energy
   in the low-loss/gain region of electron-energy spectra (i.e., at 200 keV
   +/- nh omega eV). Here, we examine the UEM imaging resolution
   implications of the strong inelastic near-field interactions between the
   photons employed in optical excitation and the probe photoelectrons. We
   find that the additional photoinduced energy dispersion occurring when
   swift electrons pass through intense evanescent near-fields results in a
   discrete chromatic aberration that limits the spatial resolving power to
   several angstroms during the excitation period.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{704-709}},

Abstract = {{The present study focuses on a design analysis of a shaped liquid piston
   compression chamber based on CFD. The liquid piston compression chamber
   is for application to Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), which can be
   used to even the mismatch between power generation and power demand,
   and, thus, the objective of the design exploration is to maximize the
   compression efficiency. Within the compression chamber is an open-cell
   metal foam medium for enhancement of heat transfer. Traditionally, the
   chamber has a cylindrical shape. The present study explores the effects
   on compression efficiency of varying the profile of cross-sectional
   diameter along the axis of the chamber. This leads to a compression
   chamber with curved walls that assume a gourd-like shape. A set of
   exploratory design cases is completed using the orthogonal array concept
   based on the Taguchi method, hence reducing the number of realizations.
   CFD simulations provide insight into how the chamber shape affects the
   flow physics during compression. A quantitative design analysis shows
   that, in general, a large aspect ratio and a steep radius change of the
   chamber is preferred, which is in line with a visualization of the CFD
   flow fields. The relative importance of each different shape parameter
   is analyzed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cold atmospheric pressure plasma (CAP) inactivates bacteria and virus
   through in situ production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species
   (RONS). While the bactericidal and virucidal efficiency of plasmas is
   well established, there is limited knowledge about the chemistry leading
   to the pathogen inactivation. This article describes a chemical analysis
   of the CAP reactive chemistry involved in the inactivation of feline
   calicivirus. We used a remote radio frequency CAP produced in varying
   gas mixtures leading to different plasma-induced chemistries. A study of
   the effects of selected scavengers complemented with positive control
   measurements of relevant RONS reveal two distinctive pathways based on
   singlet oxygen and peroxynitrous acid. The first mechanism is favored in
   the presence of oxygen and the second in the presence of air when a
   significant pH reduction is induced in the solution by the plasma.
   Additionally, smaller effects of the H2O2, O-3 and NO2 -produced were
   also found. Identification of singlet oxygen-mediated
   2-imidazolone/2-oxo-His (His + 14 Da)-an oxidative modification of His
   262 comprising the capsid protein of feline calicivirus links the plasma
   induced singlet oxygen chemistry to viral inactivation.}},

Abstract = {{In the development of low-cost, efficient, and environmentally friendly
   thin-film solar cells (TFSCs), the search continues for a suitable
   inorganic colloidal nanocrystal (NC) ink that can be easily used in
   scalable coating/printing processes. In this work, we first report on
   the colloidal synthesis of pure wurtzite (WZ) Cu2SnS3 (CTS) NCs using a
   polyol-mediated hot injection route, which is a nontoxic synthesis
   method. The synthesized material exhibits a random distribution of CTS
   nanoflakes with an average lateral dimension of similar to 94 +/- 15 nm.
   We also demonstrate that CTS NC ink can be used to fabricate low-cost
   and environmentally friendly TFSCs through an ethanol-based ink process.
   The annealing of as-deposited CTS films was performed under different S
   vapor pressures in a graphite box (volume; 12.3 cm(3)), at 580 degrees C
   for 10 min using a rapid thermal annealing (RTA) process. A comparative
   study on the performances of the solar cells with CTS absorber layers
   annealed under different S vapor pressures was conducted. The device
   derived from the CTS absorber annealed at 350 Torr of S vapor pressure
   showed the best conversion efficiency 2.77\%, which is the first notable
   efficiency for an CTS NCs ink-based TFSC. In addition, CTS TFSC's
   performance degraded only slightly after 50 days in air atmosphere and
   under damp heating at 90 degrees C for 50 h, indicating their good
   stability. These results confirm that WZ CTS NCs may be very attractive
   and interesting light-absorbing materials for fabricating efficient
   solar-harvesting devices.}},

Abstract = {{Cocontinuous polymer blends have wide applications. They can form
   conductive plastics with improved mechanical properties. When one phase
   is extracted, they yield porous polymer sheets, which can be used as
   filters or membrane supports. However, the cocontinuous morphology is
   intrinsically unstable due to coarsening during static annealing. In
   this study, silica nanoparticles, similar to 100 um diameter, with
   different wetting properties were melt compounded in
   polyethylene/poly(ethylene oxide) blends. Calculated wetting
   coefficients of these particles match well with their phase contact
   angles and their locations in the blends. We demonstrated that a
   monolayer of particles jamming at interfaces can effectively suppress
   coarsening and stabilize the cocontinuous morphology. We also correlated
   the wettability of individual particles at interface to their coarsening
   suppression ability and found that the most hydrophobic silica
   nanoparticle is the most effective to arrest coarsening. Moreover,
   during annealing, we used the rheological dynamic time sweep, a facial
   but sensitive method, to relate the morphology change with particle
   dispersion on the interface. We further corroborated these measurements
   by scanning electron microscopy and confocal microscopy imaging.}},

Pages = {{3975-3985}},

Abstract = {{Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble are
   used to study the thermodynamic and structural properties associated
   with the miscibility of binary olefin oligomer mixtures representing
   poly(ethylene-altpropylene), polypropylene, and head-to-head
   polypropylene. Single-component simulations are performed to compute the
   cohesive energy densities, Pi(CED), of different oligomers that are
   often utilized in estimating the miscibilities of compounds in the
   liquid phase but are not measurable for high-boiling compounds, such as
   polymers. Extrapolating simulation data for CS to C36 oligomers allows
   for determination of the infinite-chain-length Pi(CED) values of three
   polyolefins. The results agree remarkably well with values deduced from
   small-angle neutron scattering experiments on high-molecular-weight
   polymers. In addition, the Flory-Huggins chi parameters based on the
   free energy of mixing for pairs of olefins are calculated directly from
   simulations of binary mixtures. The binary propylene and head-to-head
   propylene oligomer blend is found to exhibit stabilized irregular mixing
   behavior, in agreement with its polymeric counterpart. This chain-length
   independence of the mixing behavior is interpreted via insights from
   structural analysis. Our results identify simulations of oligomeric
   systems as a promising route to predict and understand polymer blend
   phase behavior.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},

Abstract = {{The alloy Cu25Au30Zn45 undergoes a huge first-order phase transformation
   (6\% strain) and shows a high reversibility under thermal cycling and an
   unusual martensitc microstructure in sharp contrast to its nearby
   compositions. This alloy was discovered by systematically tuning the
   composition so that its lattice parameters satisfy the cofactor
   conditions (i.e., the kinematic conditions of compatibility between
   phases). It was conjectured that satisfaction of these conditions is
   responsible for the enhanced reversibility as well as the observed
   unusual fluid-like microstructure during transformation, but so far,
   there has been no direct evidence confirming that these observed
   microstructures are those predicted by the cofactor conditions. To
   verify this hypothesis, we use synchrotron X-ray Laue microdiffraction
   to measure the orientations and structural parameters of variants and
   phases near the austenite/martensite interface. The areas consisting of
   both austenite and multivariants of martensite are scanned by microLaue
   diffraction. The cofactor conditions have been examined from the
   kinematic relation of lattice vectors across the interface. The
   continuity condition of the interface is precisely verified from the
   correspondent lattice vectors between two phases. Published by AIP

Abstract = {{Nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NSCL/P) is one of
   the most common congenital birth defects. NSCUP is a complex
   multifactorial disease caused by interactions between multiple
   environmental and genetic factors. However, the causal single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) signature profile underlying the risk of familial
   NSCL/P still remains unknown. We previously reported a 5.7-Mb genomic
   region on chromosome 18q21.1 locus that potentially contributes to
   autosomal dominant, low-penetrance inheritance of NSCUP. In the current
   study, we performed exome sequencing on 12 familial genomes (six
   affected individuals, two obligate carriers, and four seemingly
   unaffected individuals) of a six-generation family to identify candidate
   SNPs associated with NSCUP risk. Subsequently, targeted bidirectional
   DNA re-sequencing of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified high-risk
   regions of MYO5B gene and sequenom iPLEX genotpying of 29 candidate SNPs
   were performed on a larger set of 33 members of this NSCUP family (10
   affected + 4 obligate carriers + 19 unaffected relatives) to find SNPs
   significantly associated with NSCUP trait. SNP vs. NSCUP association
   analysis showed the MYO5B SNP rs183559995 GA genotype had an odds ratio
   of 18.09 (95\% Confidence Interval = 1.86-176.34; gender adjusted P =
   0.0019) compared to the reference GG genotype. Additionally, the
   following SNPs were also found significantly associated with NSCUP risk:
   rs1450425 (LOXHD1), rs6507992 (SKA1), rs78950893 (SMAD7), rs8097060,
   rs17713847 (SCARNA1 7), rs6507872 (CTIF), rs8091995 (CTIF), and
   rs17715416 (MYO5B). We could thus identify mutations in several genes as
   key candidate SNPs associated with the risk of NSCL/P in this large
   multi-generation family.}},

Title = {{The dual effect of ephaptic coupling on cardiac conduction with
   heterogeneous expression of connexin 43}},

Abstract = {{Decreased and heterogeneous expression of connexin 43 (Cx43) are common
   features in animal heart failure models. Ephpatic coupling, which relies
   on the presence of junctional cleft space between the ends of adjacent
   cells, has been suggested to play a more active role in mediating
   intercellular electrical communication when gap junctions are reduced.
   To better understand the interplay of Cx43 expression and ephaptic
   coupling on cardiac conduction during heart failure, we performed
   numerical simulations on our model when Cx43 expression is reduced and
   heterogeneous. Under severely reduced Cx43 expression, we identified
   three new phenomena in the presence of ephaptic coupling: alternating
   conduction, in which ephaptic and gap junction-mediated mechanisms
   alternate; instability of planar fronts; and small amplitude action
   potential (SAP), which has a smaller potential amplitude than the normal
   action potential. In the presence of heterogeneous Cx43 expression,
   ephaptic coupling can either prevent or promote conduction block (CB)
   depending on the Cx43 knockout (Cx43KO) content. When Cx43KO content is
   relatively high, ephaptic coupling reduces the probabilities of CB.
   However, ephaptic coupling promotes CB when Cx43KO and wild type cells
   are mixed in roughly equal proportion, which can be attributed to an
   increase in current-to-load mismatch. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Here, we investigated the use of hyaluronic acid (HA)-decorated cationic
   lipid-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid (PLGA) hybrid nanoparticles
   (HA-DOTAP-PLGA NPs) as vaccine delivery vehicles, which were originally
   developed for the cytosolic delivery of genes. Our results demonstrated
   that after the NPs uptake by dendritic cells (DCs), some of the antigens
   that were encapsulated in HA-DOTAP-PLGA NPs escaped to the cytosolic
   compartment, and whereas some of the antigens remained in the
   endosbmal/lysosomal compartment, where both MHC-I and MHC-II antigen
   presentation occurred. Moreover, HA-DOTAP-PLGA NPs led to the
   up-regulation of MHC, costimulatory molecules, and cytokines. In vivo
   experiments further revealed that more powerful immune responses were
   induced from mite immunized with HA-DOTAP-PLGA NPs when compared with
   cationic lipid-PLGA nanoparticles and-free ovalbumin (OVA); the
   responses included antigen-specific CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell responses,
   the production of antigen-specific IgG antibodies and the generation of
   memory CD4(+). and CD8(+) T cells. Overall, these data demonstrate the
   high potential of HA-DOTAP-PLGA NPs for use as vaccine delivery vehicles
   to elevate cellular and humoral immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate control over the size of ionic liquid (IL) filled
   polymeric vesicles (polymersomes) by three distinct methods: mechanical
   extrusion, cosolvent-based processing in an IL, and fractionation of
   polymersomes in a biphasic system of IL and water. For the
   representative ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ({[}EMIM]{[}TFSI])), the size and
   dispersity of polymersomes formed from 1,2-polybutadiene-b-poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PB-PEO) and polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO) diblock
   copolymers were shown to be sensitive to assembly conditions. During
   mechanical extrusion through a polycarbonate membrane, the relatively
   larger polymersomes were broken up and reorganized into vesicles with
   mean size comparable to the membrane pore (100 nm radius); the
   distribution width also decreased significantly after only a few passes.
   Other routes were studied using the solvent-switch or cosolvent (Cs)
   method, whereby the initial content of the cosolvent and the PEO block
   length of PS-PEO were systemically changed. The nonvolatility of the
   ionic liquid directly led to the desired concentration of polymersomes
   in the ionic liquid using a single step, without the dialysis
   conventionally used in aqueous systems, and the mean vesicle size
   depended on the amount of cosolvent employed. Finally, selective phase
   transfer of PS-PEO polymersomes based on size was used to extract larger
   polymersomes from the IL to the aqueous phase via interfacial tension
   controlled phase transfer. The interfacial tension between the PS
   membrane and the aqueous phase was varied with the concentration of
   sodium chloride (NaCl) in the aqueous phase; then the larger
   polymersomes were selectively separated to the aqueous phase due to
   differences in shielding of the hydrophobic core (PS) coverage by the
   hydrophilic corona brush (PEO). This novel fractionation is a simple
   separation process without any special apparatus and can help to prepare
   monodisperse polymersomes and also separate unwanted morphologies (in
   this case, worm-like micelles).}},

Journal = {{APPLIED ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{170}},
Pages = {{403-414}},
Month = {{MAY 15}},
Abstract = {{Previously, the authors have proposed the concept of piston
   trajectory-based combustion control enabled by free piston engines
   (FPEs). With this novel method, the FPE realizes in-cycle adjustment of
   combustion phase and real-time control of in-cylinder temperature and
   pressure through variable piston trajectories. As a result, higher
   indicated thermal efficiency, compared to conventional internal
   combustion engines (ICEs), is achieved. In this paper, the effects of
   this new combustion control on engine-out emissions are investigated.
   First, a comprehensive model is developed that includes different piston
   trajectories in the FPE, a convective heat loss model and a reduced
   n-heptane reaction mechanism with major emissions species. Afterwards,
   the chemical kinetics of CO and NOx emissions are described in details
   that reveal the feasibility of reducing engine-out emissions by
   employing novel piston trajectories. At last, analyses of the
   corresponding simulation results and comparisons of emissions and
   thermal efficiencies between the FPE and conventional ICEs are
   presented, which further shows the advantages of the trajectory-based
   combustion control. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The use of rodent stroke models allow for the understanding of stroke
   pathophysiology. There is currently no gold standard neurological
   assessment to measure deficits and recovery from stroke in rodent
   models. Agreement on a universal preclinical stroke scale allows for
   comparison of the outcomes among conducted studies. The present study
   aimed to compare three routinely used neurological assessments in rodent
   studies (i.e., Garcia, Modo, and Longa) to determine which is most
   effective for accurately and consistently quantifying neurological
   deficits in the context of focal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo)
   in rats. Focal MCAo was induced in 22 male Wistar rats using a novel
   transfemoral approach. Rodents were assessed for neurological deficit
   pre-injury as well as 3 and 24 h post-injury. Data was analyzed to
   determine Pearson correlation coefficients in addition to McNemar's
   chi(2) values between each pair of neurological assessments. All three
   stroke scales, Garcia, Modo, and Longa, showed statistically significant
   changes between the baseline and the 3-hour neurological assessments. A
   trend towards neurological recovery was observed in all three stroke
   scales between the 3 and 24-hour endpoints. The three scales were highly
   correlated with each other, with Garcia and Modo having the strongest
   correlation. Of the three pairwise analyses, the comparison between the
   Garcia and Longa tests demonstrated the highest McNemar's chi(2) value,
   indicating least marginal homogeneity between these two tests. The
   combination of high correlation between Garcia and Modo tests along with
   greatest marginal heterogeneity observed between the Garcia and Longa
   test lead us to recommend the use of Garcia and Longa neurological
   scales when researchers are hoping to capture the broadest range of
   neurological factors using only two stroke scales. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The Parrinello-Rahman algorithm for imposing a general state of stress
   in periodic molecular dynamics simulations is widely used in the
   literature and has been implemented in many readily available molecular
   dynamics codes. However, what is often overlooked is that this algorithm
   controls the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress as opposed to the true
   (Cauchy) stress. This can lead to misinterpretation of simulation
   results because (1) the true stress that is imposed during the
   simulation depends on the deformation of the periodic cell, (2) the true
   stress is potentially very different from the imposed second
   Piola-Kirchhoff stress, and (3) the true stress can vary significantly
   during the simulation even if the imposed second Piola-Kirchhoff is
   constant. We propose a simple modification to the algorithm that allows
   the true Cauchy stress to be controlled directly. We then demonstrate
   the efficacy of the new algorithm with the example of martensitic phase
   transformations under applied stress. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the preparation of carbon composite Fe16N2 powders,
   and the influence of a protective carbon coating on the yield and
   magnetic properties of Fe16N2. Nanoparticle precursors with and without
   carbon were reacted under ammonia gas flow to produce Fe16N2. Neutron
   and X-ray powder diffraction indicate that the powders contain typically
   40-60\% Fe16N2, with the remaining phases being unreacted iron, Fe4N or
   Fe3N. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrates that the carbon
   coating is effective at reducing the level of sintering of Fe
   nanoparticles during the reduction stage prior to ammonolysis. XPS
   results support the retention of a carbon coating on the surface after
   ammonolysis, and that there is Fe-C bonding present at the particle
   surface. In situ TEM was used to observe loss of ordering in the
   nitrogen sublattice of carbon composite Fe16N2 powders in the range of
   168 degrees C to 200 degrees C. Magnetic susceptibility measurements
   show maximum values for saturation magnetization in the range of 232 emu
   g(-1), and for coercivity near 930 Oe, for different samples measured up
   to 2 T applied field at 300 K.}},

Abstract = {{A simple and eco-friendly method of solution processing of Cu2SnS3 (CTS)
   absorbers using an aqueous precursor solution is presented. The
   precursor solution was prepared by mixing metal salts into a mixture of
   water and ethanol (5:1) with monoethanolamine as an additive at room
   temperature. Nearly carbon-free CTS films were formed by multispin
   coating the precursor solution and heat treating in air followed by
   rapid thermal annealing in S vapor atmosphere at various temperatures.
   Exploring the role of the annealing temperature in the phase,
   composition, and morphological evolution is essential for obtaining
   highly efficient CTS-based thin film solar cells (TFSCs). Investigations
   of CTS absorber layers annealed at various temperatures revealed that
   the annealing temperature plays an important role in further improving
   device properties and efficiency. A substantial improvement in device
   efficiency occurred only at the critical annealing temperature, which
   produces a compact and void-free microstructure with large grains and
   high crystallinity as a pure-phase absorber layer. Finally, at an
   annealing temperature of 600 degrees C, the CTS thin film exhibited
   structural, compositional, and microstructural isotropy by yielding a
   reproducible power conversion efficiency of 1.80\%. Interestingly, CTS
   TFSCs exhibited good stability when stored in an air atmosphere without
   encapsulation at room temperature for 3 months, whereas the performance
   degraded slightly when subjected to accelerated aging at 80 degrees C
   for 100 h under normal laboratory conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Raw natural gas is a complex mixture comprising methane, ethane, other
   hydrocarbons, hydrogen sulfide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and water. For
   sour gas fields, selective and energy-efficient removal of H2S is one of
   the crucial challenges facing the natural-gas industry. Separation using
   nanoporous materials, such as zeolites, can be an alternative to
   energy-intensive amine-based absorption processes. Herein, the
   adsorption of binary H2S/CH4 and H2S/C2H6 mixtures in the all-silica
   forms of 386zeolitic frameworks is investigated using Monte Carlo
   simulations. Adsorption of a five-component mixture is utilized to
   evaluate the performance of the 16 most promising materials under
   close-to-real conditions. It is found that depending on the fractions of
   CH4, C2H6, and CO2, different sorbents allow for optimal H2S removal and
   hydrocarbon recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated interstitial fluid pressure can present a substantial barrier
   to drug delivery in solid tumors. This is particularly true of
   pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, a highly lethal disease characterized
   by a robust fibroinflammatory response, widespread vascular collapse,
   and hypoperfusion that together serve as primary mechanisms of treatment
   resistance. Free-fluid pressures, however, are relatively low in
   pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and cannot account for the vascular
   collapse. Indeed, we have shown that the overexpression and deposition
   in the interstitium of high-molecular-weight hyaluronan (HA) is
   principally responsible for generating pressures that can reach 100 mmHg
   through the creation of a large gel-fluid phase. By interrogating a
   variety of tissues, tumor types, and experimental model systems, we show
   that an HA-dependent fluid phase contributes substantially to pressures
   in many solid tumors and has been largely unappreciated heretofore. We
   investigated the relative contributions of both freely mobile fluid and
   gel fluid to interstitial fluid pressure by performing simultaneous,
   real-time fluid-pressure measurements with both the classical
   wick-in-needle method (to estimate free-fluid pressure) and a
   piezoelectric pressure catheter transducer (which is capable of
   capturing pressures associated with either phase). We demonstrate
   further that systemic treatment with pegylated recombinant hyaluronidase
   (PEGPH20) depletes interstitial HA and eliminates the gel-fluid phase.
   This significantly reduces interstitial pressures and leaves primarily
   free fluid behind, relieving the barrier to drug delivery. These
   findings argue that quantifying the contributions of free- and gel-fluid
   phases to hydraulically transmitted pressures in a given cancer will be
   essential to designing the most appropriate and effective strategies to
   overcome this important and frequently underestimated resistance
   mechanism.}},

Abstract = {{The mechanism of crystalline cellulose fragmentation has been debated
   between classical models proposing end chain or intrachain scission to
   form short-chain (molten) anhydro-oligomer mixtures and volatile organic
   compounds. Models developed over the last few decades suggest global
   kinetics consistent with either mechanism, but validation of the
   chain-scission mechanism-via measured reaction rates of cellulose has
   remained elusive. To resolve these differences, we introduce a new
   thermal-pulsing reactor four orders of magnitude faster than
   conventional thermogravimetic analysis (10(6) vs 10(2) degrees C/min) to
   measure the millisecond-resolved evolution of cellulose and its volatile
   products at 400-550 degrees C. By comparison of cellulose conversion and
   furan product formation kinetics, both mechanisms are shown to occur
   with the transition from chain-end scission to intrachain scission above
   467 degrees C concurrent with liquid formation comprised of short-chain
   cellulose fragments.}},

   degree of polymerization of the core block, N-B, followed a power law
   relationship in which R-c similar to N-B(0.71 +/- 0.01). The corona
   thickness (L-corona), given by the difference of R-h and R-c, does not
   show any apparent dependence on N-B. These results were compared to
   scaling theory, and were found to be only in partial agreement with the
   star model proposed by Halperin et al. However, the mean-field
   calculations of micellar dimensions by Nagarajan and Ganesh were in
   excellent agreement with the, data. This comprehensive experimental
   study, provides precise quantification of the R-c and L-corona
   dependence on core block:lengths, due to the use of seven different
   block copolymers with identical corona block lengths.}},

Abstract = {{We report the discovery of a dodecagonal quasicrystalline state (DDQC)
   in a sphere (micelle) forming poly(isoprene-b-lactide) (IL) diblock
   copolymer melt, investigated as a function of time following rapid
   cooling from above the order-disorder transition temperature (T-ODT = 66
   degrees C) using small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements.
   Between T-ODT and the order-order transition temperature T-OOT = 42
   degrees C, an equilibrium body-centered cubic (BCC) structure forms,
   whereas below T-OOT the Frank-Kasper sigma phase is the stable
   morphology. At T < 40 degrees C the supercooled disordered state evolves
   into a metastable DDQC that transforms with time to the sigma phase. The
   times required to form the DDQC and sigma phases are strongly
   temperature dependent, requiring several hours and about 2 d at 35
   degrees C and more than 10 and 200 d at 25 degrees C, respectively.
   Remarkably, the DDQC forms only from the supercooled disordered state,
   whereas the sigma phase grows directly when the BCC phase is cooled
   below T-OOT and vice versa upon heating. A transition in the rapidly
   supercooled disordered material, from an ergodic liquid-like arrangement
   of particles to a nonergodic soft glassy-like solid, occurs below
   similar to 40 degrees C, coincident with the temperature associated with
   the formation of the DDQC. We speculate that this stiffening reflects
   the development of particle clusters with local tetrahedral or
   icosahedral symmetry that seed growth of the temporally transient DDQC
   state. This work highlights extraordinary opportunities to uncover the
   origins and stability of aperiodic order in condensed matter using model
   block polymers.}},

Month = {{MAY 9}},
Abstract = {{Over the past decade, the technology to engineer genetically modified
   swine has seen many advancements, and because their physiology is
   remarkably similar to that of humans, swine models of cancer may be
   extremely valuable for preclinical safety studies as well as toxicity
   testing of pharmaceuticals prior to the start of human clinical trials.
   Hence, the benefits of using swine as a large animal model in cancer
   research and the potential applications and future opportunities of
   utilizing pigs in cancer modeling are immense. In this review, we
   discuss how pigs have been and can be used as a biomedical models for
   cancer research, with an emphasis on current technologies. We have
   focused on applications of precision genetics that can provide models
   that mimic human cancer predisposition syndromes. In particular, we
   describe the advantages of targeted gene-editing using custom
   endonucleases, specifically TALENs and CRISPRs, and transposon systems,
   to make novel pig models of cancer with broad preclinical applications.}},

Title = {{Synthesis of Fe16N2 compound Free-Standing Foils with 20 MGOe Magnetic
   Energy Product by Nitrogen Ion-Implantation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{Rare-earth-free magnets are highly demanded by clean and renewable
   energy industries because of the supply constraints and environmental
   issues. A promising permanent magnet should possess high remanent
   magnetic flux density (B-r), large coercivity (H-c) and hence large
   maximum magnetic energy product ((BH)(max)). Fe16N2 has been emerging as
   one of promising candidates because of the redundancy of Fe and N on the
   earth, its large magnetocrystalline anisotropy (Ku > 1.0 x 10(7)
   erg/cc), and large saturation magnetization (4 pi Ms > 2.4 T). However,
   there is no report on the formation of Fe16N2 magnet with high Br and
   large Hc in bulk format before. In this paper, we successfully
   synthesize freestanding Fe16N2 foils with a coercivity of up to 1910 Oe
   and a magnetic energy product of up to 20 MGOe at room temperature.
   Nitrogen ion implantation is used as an alternative nitriding approach
   with the benefit of tunable implantation energy and fluence. An
   integrated synthesis technique is developed, including a direct
   foil-substrate bonding step, an ion implantation step and a two-step
   post-annealing process. With the tunable capability of the ion
   implantation fluence and energy, a microstructure with grain size 25-30
   nm is constructed on the FeN foil sample with the implantation fluence
   of 5 x 10(17)/cm(2).}},

Abstract = {{This work explores the volatility of particles produced from two diesel
   low temperature combustion (LTC) modes proposed for high-efficiency
   compression ignition engines. It also explores mechanisms of particulate
   formation and growth upon dilution in the near-tailpipe environment. The
   number distribution of exhaust particles from low- and mid-load
   dual-fuel reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) and
   single-fuel premixed charge compression ignition (PPCI) modes were
   experimentally studied over a gradient of dilution temperature. Particle
   volatility of select particle diameters was investigated using
   volatility tandem differential mobility analysis (V-TDMA). Evaporation
   rates for exhaust particles were compared with V-TDMA results for
   candidate pure n-alkanes to identify species with similar volatility
   characteristics. The results show that LTC particles are mostly
   comprised of material with volatility similar to engine oil alkanes.
   V-TDMA results were used as inputs to an aerosol condensation and
   evaporation model to support the finding that smaller particles in the
   distribution are comprised of lower volatility material than large
   particles under primary dilution conditions. Although our results show
   that saturation levels are high enough to drive condensation of alkanes
   onto existing particles under the dilution conditions investigated, they
   are not high enough to allow homogeneous nucleation of these same
   compounds in the primary exhaust plume. Therefore, we conclude that
   observed particles from LTC operation must grow from low concentrations
   of highly nonvolatile compounds present in the exhaust.Copyright (c)

   with platinum and gold overlayers}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{18}},
Month = {{MAY 2}},
Abstract = {{We present measurements of spin pumping detected by the inverse spin
   Hall effect voltage and ferromagnetic resonance spectroscopy in a series
   of metallic ferromagnet/normal metal thin film stacks. We compare
   heterostructures grown in situ to those where either a magnetic or
   nonmagnetic oxide is introduced between the two metals. The
   heterostructures, either nickel with a platinum overlayer (Ni/Pt) or the
   nickel-iron alloy permalloy (Py) with a gold overlayer (Py/Au), were
   also characterized in detail using grazing-incidence x-ray reflectivity,
   Auger electron spectroscopy, and both SQUID and alternating-gradient
   magnetometry. We verify the presence of oxide layers, characterize layer
   thickness, composition, and roughness, and probe saturation
   magnetization, coercivity, and anisotropy. The results show that while
   the presence of a nonmagnetic oxide at the interface suppresses spin
   transport from the ferromagnet to the nonmagnetic metal, a thin magnetic
   oxide (here the native oxide formed on both Py and Ni) somewhat enhances
   the product of the spin-mixing conductance and the spin Hall angle. We
   also observe clear evidence of an out-of-plane component of magnetic
   anisotropy in Ni/Pt samples that is enhanced in the presence of the
   native oxide, resulting in perpendicular exchange bias. Finally, the dc
   inverse spin Hall voltages generated at ferromagnetic resonance in our
   Py/Au samples are large, and suggest values for the spin Hall angle in
   gold of 0.04 < alpha(SH) < 0.22, in line with the highest values
   reported for Au. This is interpreted as resulting from Fe impurities. We
   present indirect evidence that the Au films described here indeed have
   significant impurity levels.}},

Title = {{Chronic cyclic vagus nerve stimulation has beneficial
   electrophysiological effects on healthy hearts in the absence of
   autonomic imbalance}},

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease degrades the regulatory function of the autonomic
   nervous system. Cyclic vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is an already
   FDA-approved therapy for drug-resistant epilepsy and depression, and has
   been shown to normalize autonomic function and improve objective
   measures of heart function and subjective measures of heart failure
   symptoms. However, it remains unclear whether VNS may induce negative
   effects in patients with potentially healthy hearts where VNS can be
   used for epileptic patients. Hence, this study aims to investigate the
   effects of VNS on the hearts of healthy rats with normal autonomic
   balance. Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with stimulators and
   randomized to either Sham or VNS groups. Rats in VNS group received 10
   weeks of chronic intermittent VNS via stimulation of the right cervical
   vagus nerve. Echocardiography was performed at Baseline (prior to VNS),
   Week 2, and Week 9. After 10 weeks, high-resolution optical mapping was
   performed in ex vivo perfused hearts to evaluate the
   electrophysiological remodeling that occurs in the heart as a result of
   the VNS therapy. Chronic VNS modified the electrophysiological
   properties of healthy rat hearts by reducing the action potential
   duration at 50\% (APD(50)) and 80\% (APD(80)) repolarization. Chronic
   VNS also affected the restitution properties of the heart at the APD(50)
   level and increased myocardial conduction velocity (CV). VNS did not
   induce any significant changes to ventricular ejection fraction (EF) and
   spatial dispersion of APD, thus indicating that VNS did not negatively
   affect cardiac function. VNS also reduced the susceptibility to
   ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular fibrillation {[}VF] and ventricular
   tachycardia {[}VT]) during ex vivo programmed electrical stimulation. In
   summary, chronic application of cyclic VNS induces changes to the
   electrophysiological properties of healthy rat hearts. The observed
   decrease in APD and increase in CV suggest that the beneficial effects
   of VNS do not require the presence of existing autonomic imbalance.}},

Title = {{Ricci curvature: An economic indicator for market fragility and systemic
   risk}},
Journal = {{SCIENCE ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the systemic risk and fragility of financial systems is of
   vital importance in analyzing market efficiency, deciding on portfolio
   allocation, and containing financial contagions. At a high level,
   financial systems may be represented as weighted graphs that
   characterize the complex web of interacting agents and information flow
   (for example, debt, stock returns, and shareholder ownership). Such a
   representation often turns out to provide keen insights. We show that
   fragility is a system-level characteristic of ``business-as-usual{''}
   market behavior and that financial crashes are invariably preceded by
   system-level changes in robustness. This was done by leveraging previous
   work, which suggests that Ricci curvature, a key geometric feature of a
   given network, is negatively correlated to increases in network
   fragility. To illustrate this insight, we examine daily returns from a
   set of stocks comprising the Standard and Poor's 500 (S\&P 500) over a
   15-year span to highlight the fact that corresponding changes in Ricci
   curvature constitute a financial ``crash hallmark.{''} This work lays
   the foundation of understanding how to design (banking) systems and
   policy regulations in a manner that can combat financial instabilities
   exposed during the 2007-2008 crisis.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of conformal AlF3 coatings onto both flat
   silicon substrates and high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 (NMC) Li-ion
   battery cathode powders was investigated using a Al(CH3)(3)/TaF5
   precursor combination. This optimized approach employs easily handled
   ALD precursors, while also obviating the use of highly toxic HF(g). In
   studies conducted on planar Si wafers, the film's growth mode was
   dictated by a competition between the desorption and decomposition of Ta
   reaction byproducts. At T >= 200 degrees C, a rapid decomposition of the
   Ta reaction byproducts to TaC led to continuous deposition and high
   concentrations of TaC in the films. A self-limited ALD growth mode was
   found to occur when the deposition temperature was reduced to 125
   degrees C, and the TaF5 exposures were followed by an extended purge.
   The lower temperature process suppressed conversion of TaFx(CH3)(5-x) to
   nonvolatile TaC, and the long purges enabled nearly complete
   TaFx(CH3)(5-x) desorption, leaving behind the AlF3 thin films. NMC
   cathode powders were coated using these optimized conditions, and coin
   cells employing these coated cathode particles exhibited significant
   improvements in charge capacity fade at high discharge rates. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A process for making a starch-based cationic flocculant for microalgae
   harvest was studied and the performance of the flocculant was evaluated.
   The substituted cationic starch was prepared by reacting corn starch
   with glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTAC), during which the
   hydroxyl groups of anhydroglucose units of the starch were partially
   substituted by the ammonium groups through etherification. The factors
   affecting degree of substitution (DS), such as reaction temperature and
   time, catalyst amount, and the water content were investigated and
   optimal reaction conditions were determined. The relationship between DS
   and microalgae harvest was determined. A batch of cationic starch with
   optimal DS was synthesized and used for flocculation experiments. The
   flocculation experiment results showed that, for the original microalgae
   concentration (dry weight) of 1 g/L, the cationic starch-based
   flocculants can harvest over 90\% of the microalgae in pH from 5 to 10,
   with the aggregation and precipitation time of 10 min to 30 min, and the
   mass ratios of flocculants to microalgae of 1:8-1:18 (dry mass ratio).
   Using starch-based flocculant to harvest microalgae in the effluent is
   not only efficient, but also nontoxic to the water system, which is very
   important to the effluent reuse and certain microalgae applications.}},

   Phosphorus}},
Journal = {{ADVANCED ELECTRONIC MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Black phosphorus (BP) has emerged as a direct bandgap semiconducting
   material with great application potentials in electronics, photonics,
   and energy conversion. Experimental characterization of the anisotropic
   thermal properties of BP at the micrometer scale is extremely
   challenging. This study reports measurement results of the anisotropic
   thermal conductivity of BP along three primary crystalline orientations,
   using a novel time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect. The thermal
   conductivity along the zigzag crystalline direction is 84-101 W m(-1)
   K-1, nearly three times as large as that along the armchair direction
   (26-36 W m(-1) K-1). The through-plane thermal conductivity of BP ranges
   from 4.3 to 5.5 W m(-1) K-1. This study performs first-principles
   calculation to predict the phonon transport in BP along both in-plane
   through-plane directions, and identifies that the strong anisotropy of
   thermal transport in BP can be attributed to the
   structural-asymmetry-induced group velocity variations along different
   crystalline orientations, and the relaxation time variation induced by
   the direction of the applied temperature gradient. This work
   successfully unveils the fundamental mechanisms of anisotropic thermal
   transport along the three crystalline directions in BP, as demonstrated
   by the excellent agreement between the first-principles-based
   theoretical predictions and experimental characterizations on the
   anisotropic thermal conductivities of BP.}},

   elements, including Co and Mn, are compared in terms of its preferred
   position and magnetic coupling mode. It is found that Mn prefers Fe1
   position and ferromagnetic coupling in the Fe16N2 lattice. So Mn is
   considered as a promising dopant in Fe16N2 magnet to improve its thermal
   stability. Based on theoretical results, experiments are conducted by a
   cold-crucible method to prepare (Fe1-xMnx) N bulk samples. The samples
   are thermal treated at different temperatures to observe their thermal
   stabilities. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and vibrating sample magnetometer
   (VSM) are characterized on the samples. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Cubic FeCo alloy nanoparticles (NPs) with body-centered cubic (bcc)
   phase were prepared using sputter based gas-condensation method. When
   the NPs formed long chain assemblies, the magnetic properties were quite
   different from that of well-dispersed NPs. Most of the well-dispersed
   NPs were superparamagnetic at room temperature while the long chain NP
   assemblies were ferromagnetic with coercivities around 765 Oe, which
   displayed quite different magnetic properties. The ferromagnetism of
   long chain NPs was from the exchange coupling between NPs, which
   eventually led to the transition from superparamagnetism (SPM) to
   superferromagetism (SFM). Zero-field-cooled (ZFC) and field-cooled (FC)
   curves were obtained and long chain NP assemblies displayed
   ferromagnetism at the temperature ranging from 10 K to 400 K.
   Time-dependent remanent magnetic moment curves also indicated that the
   long chain structure had better thermal stability due to the strong
   exchange coupling. (C) 2016 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{(001) textured Fe16N2 thin film with Ag under layer is successfully

   After post annealing, chemically ordered Fe16N2 phase is formed and

   is measured by a vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM). In comparison with
   Fe16N2 with Ag under layer on MgO substrate and Fe16N2 with Fe under

   to characterize the binding energy of N atoms. To verify the role of
   strain that the FeN layer experiences in the above three structures,
   Grazing Incidence X-ray Diffraction (GIXRD) is conducted to reveal a

Abstract = {{Due to increasing threats of global warming and climate change concerns,
   green wireless communications have recently drawn intense attention
   toward reducing carbon emissions. Aligned with this goal, the present
   paper deals with dynamic energy management for smart-grid powered
   coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmissions. To address the intrinsic
   variability of renewable energy sources, a novel energy transaction
   mechanism is introduced for grid-connected base stations that are also
   equipped with an energy storage unit. Aiming to minimize the expected
   energy transaction cost while guaranteeing the worst-case users' quality
   of service, an infinite-horizon optimization problem is formulated to
   obtain the optimal downlink transmit beamformers that are robust to
   channel uncertainties. Capitalizing on the virtual-queue-based
   relaxation technique and the stochastic dual-subgradient method, an
   efficient online algorithm is developed yielding a feasible and
   asymptotically optimal solution. Numerical tests with synthetic and real
   data corroborate the analytical performance claims and highlight the
   merits of the novel approach.}},

Abstract = {{As a measure of randomness or uncertainty, the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy
   H has become one of the most widely used summary measures of a variety
   of attributes (characteristics) in different disciplines. This paper
   points out an often overlooked limitation of H: comparisons between
   differences in H-values are not valid. An alternative entropy H-K is
   introduced as a preferred member of a new family of entropies for which
   difference comparisons are proved to be valid by satisfying a given
   value-validity condition. The H-K is shown to have the appropriate
   properties for a randomness (uncertainty) measure, including a close
   linear relationship to a measurement criterion based on the Euclidean
   distance between probability distributions. This last point is
   demonstrated by means of computer generated random distributions. The
   results are also compared with those of another member of the entropy
   family. A statistical inference procedure for the entropy H-K is
   formulated.}},

Abstract = {{The opportunity to produce algal biofuel cost-effectively from waste
   materials, such as piggery-digested waste, drives research to optimize
   piggery waste effluent as an algal growth medium. Therefore, the aim of
   this study was to investigate the potential of newly isolated
   wastewater-born yeast to optimize growth parameters and maximize
   pollutant degradation in digested wastewater bioremediation. One isolate
   was identified as Galactomyces geotrichum through morphological
   observation and DNA sequencing. Growth parameters regarding pH,
   temperature, and inoculum amount were optimized by orthogonal design to
   maximize pollutant removal. Results showed that optimal growth
   conditions were pH 6, 25 degrees C, and 2.5g mycelium pellet moisture
   weight. Chemical oxygen demand (COD) reached 60\% and total phosphorus
   (TP) reduction reached 45\% under these conditions. Our observations
   demonstrate that pH had an overall significant effect on COD and TP
   reduction. More importantly, results suggested that pretreatment with
   locally isolated yeast is a nontoxic and ecofriendly method when
   compared to chemical reagents in preparing piggery waste as a medium for
   algal growth. This study provides a new microbial resource for removal
   of pollutants from piggery-digested wastewater. In this study, for the
   first time, algal biofuel feedstock was prepared by yeast pretreatment
   of undiluted and unsterilized piggery-digested waste, cost-effectively
   answering both energy needs and environmental concerns with a renewable

Abstract = {{Energy insecurity and resource shortage are driving societies to look
   for sustainable and renewable energy and resource supplies. Thus,
   converting biomass into useful energy and chemical products has
   attracted considerable attention in the past decades. As a carbon-rich
   renewable biomass source, lignin has been extensively studied as a raw
   material to produce bioenergy and value-added chemicals. Fuel gas and
   phenolic products can be obtained by converting lignin. This study
   strives to extensively review recent developments in the
   microwave-assisted pyrolysis and solvolysis of lignin. Lignin structural
   components and extraction techniques are described under different
   conditions. In addition, the fundamentals and advantages of microwave
   heating technology and the background of lignin pyrolysis and solvolysis
   are presented. The effectual parameters of the microwave-assisted
   pyrolysis and solvolysis of lignin and their advantages are also
   summarized. This review concludes that microwave-assisted technology is
   an effective method for significantly reducing reaction time and
   improving the yields and selectivity of target products. In the future,
   low-cost catalysts and microwave-assisted conversion units need to be
   developed to achieve large-scale production of renewable fuels and
   value-added chemicals from lignin. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Microwave-assisted pyrolysis (MAP) of soapstock with and without
   microwave absorbent was conducted to produce hydrocarbon fuel. The use
   of microwave absorbent significantly increased the hydrocarbon yield and
   the contents of alkanes and aromatics in the hydrocarbons. The effects
   of pyrolysis temperature and feeding rate on hydrocarbon yield and
   composition were investigated, with SiC particles as the microwave
   absorbent bed. The optimal conditions for the microwave-assisted
   pyrolysis of soapstock include use of the microwave absorbent bed, a
   temperature of 550 degrees C, and a feeding rate of 6g/min. Under the
   conditions, the yield of hydrocarbon fuel reached 64.74 wt.\%, with high
   proportions of alkanes and low proportions of alkenes. The calorific
   value of hydrocarbon fuel from microwave-assisted pyrolysis of soapstock
   is higher than that of biodiesel, but lower than that of 0(\#) diesel.
   The density and dynamic viscosity of the pyrolysis fuel are similar to
   those of 0(\#) diesel. In addition, the hydrocarbon fuel has low
   temperature fluidity, freezing point and cold filter plugging point.
   This study reveals that fast microwave assisted pyrolysis of soapstock
   is a promising technology for commercial production of hydrocarbon fuel.
   Further studies are needed on the catalyst addition to improve the
   properties of hydrocarbon fuel. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We report the phase behavior of a series of
   poly(styrene)-b-poly(isoprene)-b-poly(styrene)'-b-poly-(ethyleneoxide)
   (SIS'O) tetrablock terpolymers. This study was motivated by
   self-consistent field theory (SCFT) calculations that anticipate a rich
   array of sphere-forming morphologies with variations in the molecular
   symmetry parameter tau = N-S/(N-S +N-S')where N is the block degree of
   polymerization and the volume fraction of 0 is less than about 0.22.
   Eight SIS'O samples, with tau ranging from 0.21 to 0.73, were
   synthesized and investigated using small-angle Xray scattering and
   transmission electron microscopy, yielding evidence of nine different
   spherical phases: hexagonal, FCC, HCP, BCC, rhombohedral (tentative),
   liquid-like packing, dodecagonal quasicrystal, and Frank-Kasper sigma
   and A15 phases. At temperatures close to the order disorder transition,
   these tetrablocks behave as pseudo-{[}SIS']-O diblocks and form
   equilibrium morphologies mediated by facile chain exchange between
   micelles. Transition from equilibrium to nonequilibrium behavior occurs
   at a temperature (T-erg) several tens of degrees below the order
   disorder transition temperature, speculated to be coincident with the
   loss of ergodicity, as chain exchange is arrested due to increased
   segregation strength between the core (O) and corona (SIS') blocks.
   Nonequilibrium ordered structures form when T < T-erg; these are
   interpreted using SCFT calculations to elucidate the free energy
   landscape driving ordering in the S and I block matrix. These
   experiments demonstrate a profound dependence on phase stability with
   variations in tau and temperature, providing insights into the formation
   of ordered phase symmetry in this class of asymmetric multiblock
   polymers.}},

Title = {{Y Effects of hydrology, watershed size, and agricultural practices on
   sediment yields in two river basins in Iowa and Mississippi}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{71}},

Abstract = {{The specific sediment yield (SSY) from watersheds is the result of the
   balance between natural, scale-dependent erosion and deposition
   processes, but can be greatly altered by human activities. In general,
   the SSY decreases along the course of a river as sediments are trapped
   in alluvial plains and other sinks. However, this relation between SSY
   and basin area can actually be an increasing one when there is a
   predominance of channel erosion relative to hillslope erosion. The US
   Geological Survey (USGS) conducted a study of suspended sediment in the
   Iowa River basin (IRB), Iowa, and the Yazoo River basin (YRB),
   Mississippi, from 2006 through 2008. Within each river basin, the SSY
   from four largely agricultural watersheds of various sizes (2.3 to
   35,000 km(2) {[}0.9 to 13,513 mi(2)]) was investigated. In the smallest
   watersheds,YRB sites had greater SSY compared to IRB sites due to higher
   rain erosivity, more erodible soils, more overland flow, and fluvial
   geomorphological differences. Watersheds in the YRB showed a steady
   decrease in SSY with increasing drainage basin area, whereas in the IRB,
   the maximum SSY occurred at the 30 to 500 km(2) (11.6 to 193 mi(2))
   scale. Subsurface tile drainage and limits to channel downcutting
   restrict the upstream migration of sediment sources in the IRB.
   Nevertheless, by comparing the SSY-basin size scaling relationships with
   estimated rates of field erosion under conservation and conventional
   tillage treatments reported in previous literature, we show evidence
   that the SSY-basin size relationship in both the IRB and YRB remain
   impacted by historical erosion rates that occurred prior to conservation
   efforts.}},

Abstract = {{Research aimed at designing and optimizing open framework materials for

   identifying synthesis conditions that yield crystals with tailored

   synthetically realized materials. Accomplishing these goals requires
   detailed knowledge of nucleation in order to cultivate efficient,

Abstract = {{Hyaluronan (HA) is a structurally simple polysaccharide, but its ability
   to act as a template for organizing pericellular matrices and its
   regulated synthesis and degradation are key to initiating repair
   responses. Importantly, these HA functions are usurped by tumor cells to
   facilitate progression and metastasis. Recent advances have identified
   the functional complexities associated with the synthesis and
   degradation of HA-rich matrices. Three enzymes synthesize large HA
   polymers while multiple hyaluronidases or tissue free radicals degrade
   these into smaller bioactive fragments. A family of extracellular and
   cell-associated HA-binding proteins/receptors translates the
   bioinformation encrypted in this complex polymer mixture to activate
   signaling networks required for cell survival, proliferation, and
   migration in an actively remodeling microenvironment. Changes in HA
   metabolism within both the peritumor stroma and parenchyma are linked to
   tumor initiation, progression, and poor clinical outcome. We review
   evidence that metastatic tumor cells must acquire the capability to
   autonomously synthesize, assemble, and process their own ``portable{''}
   HA-rich microenvironments to survive in the circulation, metastasize to
   ectopic sites, and escape therapeutic intervention. Strategies to
   disrupt the HA machinery of primary tumor and circulating tumor cells
   may enhance the effectiveness of current conventional and targeted
   therapies. (C) 2016 AACR.}},

   to address these issues, and to develop liver-targeted approaches using
   novel gene editing technologies, including ZFN, TALEN, CRISPR/Cas and
   PITCh. While each of these methods utilizes a distinct mechanism of gene
   modification at the genomic level, they all are dependent on an
   efficient delivery system to the target site within the host cell. This
   review will provide an overview on current and emerging therapeutic
   strategies for the treatment of liver diseases.
   Expert opinion: Clinical trials for liver gene therapy have entered an
   exciting stage and are already showing promise with the development of
   novel technologies and delivery options. A deeper understanding of
   off-target effects produced by gene editing approaches and immune
   responses generated in host cells by gene carriers is needed to fully
   realize their potential.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Compare the transmural distribution of forward creatine kinase
   reaction (k(f, CK)) and ATP hydrolysis rate (k(r, ATPase)) in the
   myocardium of normal porcine heart. Rate constants were extracted from
   partially relaxed spectra by applying the T-1(nom) method, effectively
   reducing data acquisition time by up to an order of magnitude.
   Theory and Methods: T-1(nom) method for double saturation of PCr and Pi
   is introduced and validated through simulations. Bioenergetics was
   measured in vivo utilizing one-dimensional chemical shift imaging
   (1D-CSI) magnetic resonance 31 P spectroscopy.
   Results: At basal conditions, there was no significant difference
   between subepicardial layers (EPI) vs. the subendocardial layers (ENDO)
   for both flux(f, CK) and flux(r, ATPase). At high cardiac workload
   (HWL), where the rate pressure product increased 2.6-fold, PCr/ATP ratio
   and fluxf, CK showed no significant change in both EPI and ENDO layers,
   while flux(r, ATPase) increased significantly (baseline: 1.11 +/- 0.12
   and 1.12 +/- 0.13 mu mol/g/s, EPI and ENDO, respectively; to HWL: 2.35
   +/- 0.27 and 2.21 +/- 0.08 mu mol/g/s, EPI and ENDO, respectively, each
   P < 0.01 vs. baseline).
   Conclusion: In the normal heart, increase of cardiac work state is
   accompanied by an increase in ATP hydrolysis rate with no changes in CK
   flux rate. There are no significant differences between EPI vs. ENDO
   concerning the ATP hydrolysis rate or CK flux rate in both baseline and
   high cardiac work states. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a theoretical study on the integration of a
   membrane reactor (MR) for carbon capture into an integrated gasification
   combined cycle (IGCC) plant. First-principles, simplified systems-level
   models for the individual IGCC units and the MR are introduced for their
   subsequent plantwide integration. The integrated plant model is then
   used for simulation studies that assume different MR characteristics.
   Using this model, an optimization problem is formulated to analyze the
   MR effects when adding it to the IGCC plant, while satisfying all of the
   process constraints in streams and performance variables. The solution
   of this optimization problem indicates improvements in the original case
   studies, including capital cost savings as high as \$18 million for the
   optimal case under nominal process conditions. To determine the cost
   implications of inserting the MR into the IGCC plant, a differential
   cost analysis is performed taking into account major plant capital and
   operating costs. This analysis considers the same amount of coal and
   power generation for cases with and without the MR. The results of this
   analysis based on a present value of annuity calculation show break even
   costs for the MR within the feasible range for membrane fabrication,
   even for short membrane lifetimes. (C) 2016 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Social recommendation techniques have been developed to employ user's
   social connections for both rating prediction and Top-N recommendation.
   However, they are mostly using social network enhanced matrix
   factorization (MF) where the objective is to minimize the prediction
   error of rating scores, which makes it impractical and unsuccessful for
   Top-N recommendation. This paper thus focuses on developing more
   effective methods to utilize social network information for Top-N
   recommendation. Social network regularized Sparse Linear Model (SocSLIM)
   with its extensions incorporating local learning (LocSocSLIM) to improve
   efficiency are proposed. SocSLIM learns sparse coefficient matrix for
   users by solving a sparse representation problem over user-item
   rating/purchase matrix and user-user social network's adjacency matrix
   at the same time by sharing coefficient matrix. The coefficient matrix
   is used to predict the recommendation scores, which are then combined
   with a proposed item based Distance regularized Sparse Linear Model
   (DSLIM) to generate recommendations for the users. The experimental
   results demonstrate that SocSLIM effectively uses the social information
   to outperform the state-of-the-art methods by at least 12\%. Moreover,
   the local weight learning extension LocSocSLIM significantly improves
   the efficiency up to 10 times as compared to SocSLIM as the original
   SLIM while achieving the close performance guarantees. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of steering a linear dynamical system with
   complete state observation from an initial Gaussian distribution in
   state-space to a final one with minimum energy control. The system is
   stochastically driven through the control channels; an example for such
   a system is that of an inertial particle experiencing random ``white
   noise{''} forcing. We show that a target probability distribution can
   always be achieved in finite time. The optimal control is given in
   state-feedback form and is computed explicitly by solving a pair of
   differential Lyapunov equations that are nonlinearly coupled through
   their boundary values. This result, given its attractive algorithmic
   nature, appears to have several potential applications such as to
   quality control, control of industrial processes, as well as to active
   control of nanomechanical systems and molecular cooling. The problem to
   steer a diffusion process between end-point marginals has a long history
   (Schrodinger bridges) and the present case of steering a linear
   stochastic system constitutes such a Schrodinger bridge for possibly
   degenerate diffusions. Our results provide the first implementable form
   of the optimal control for a general Gauss-Markov process. Illustrative
   examples are provided for steering inertial particles and for
   ``cooling{''} a stochastic oscillator. A final result establishes
   directly the property of Schrodinger bridges as the most likely random
   evolution between given marginals to the present context of linear
   stochastic systems. A second part to this work, that is to appear as
   part II, addresses the general situation where the stochastic excitation
   enters through channels that may differ from those used to control.}},

Abstract = {{We address the problem of steering the state of a linear stochastic
   system to a prescribed distribution over a finite horizon with minimum
   energy, and the problem to maintain the state at a stationary
   distribution over an infinite horizon with minimum power. For both
   problems the control and Gaussian noise channels are allowed to be
   distinct, thereby, placing the results of this paper outside of the
   scope of previous work both in probability and in control. The special
   case where the disturbance and control enter through the same channels
   has been addressed in the first part of this work that was presented as
   Part I. Herein, we present sufficient conditions for optimality in terms
   of a system of dynamically coupled Riccati equations in the finite
   horizon case and in terms of algebraic conditions for the stationary
   case. We then address the question of feasibility for both problems. For
   the finite-horizon case, provided the system is controllable, we prove
   that without any restriction on the directionality of the stochastic
   disturbance it is always possible to steer the state to any arbitrary
   Gaussian distribution over any specified finite time-interval. For the
   stationary infinite horizon case, it is not always possible to maintain
   the state at an arbitrary Gaussian distribution through constant
   state-feedback. It is shown that covariances of admissible stationary
   Gaussian distributions are characterized by a certain Lyapunov-like
   equation and, in fact, they coincide with the class of stationary state
   covariances that can be attained by a suitable stationary colored noise
   as input. We finally address the question of how to compute suitable
   controls numerically. We present an alternative to solving the system of
   coupled Riccati equations, by expressing the optimal controls in the
   form of solutions to (convex) semi-definite programs for both cases. We
   conclude with an example to steer the state covariance of the
   distribution of inertial particles to an admissible stationary Gaussian
   distribution over a finite interval, to be maintained at that stationary
   distribution thereafter by constant-gain state-feedback control.}},

Abstract = {{In this brief, a frequency-to-current conversion-based fractional
   frequency synthesizer is implemented in 32-nm technology utilizing a
   high-density deep trench capacitor. The technique proposed here can
   replace the use of multiple crystal oscillators or a phase-locked loop
   for medium accuracy clock generation with very low chip area and power
   consumption. In addition to exploiting the inherently low variation of
   capacitors as compared to that of transistors, the proposed circuit
   generates an output frequency proportional to the capacitor ratio,
   canceling out any small process-voltage-temperature (PVT) dependences of
   the capacitor. The performance of the fractional synthesizer is verified
   from chip measurement results. An output frequency range of 16-156 MHz
   is covered with a frequency resolution of 0.8 MHz using a 4-MHz
   reference clock. The total area of the frequency synthesizer core is
   only 0.0054 mm(2), and it consumes 116 mu W of power from a 0.9-V supply
   while generating an output frequency of 48 MHz. The output frequency
   variation is +/- 0.14\% at 48 MHz for a temperature sweep from -40
   degrees C to 90 degrees C. Periodic jitter measured from an on-chip
   high-resolution jitter measurement circuit is 115 ps (rms) at 76 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Local and inter-area oscillations in bulk power systems are typically
   identified using spatial profiles of poorly damped modes, and they are
   mitigated via carefully tuned decentralized controllers. In this paper,
   we employ non-modal tools to analyze and control inter-area
   oscillations. Our input-output analysis examines power spectral density
   and variance amplification of stochastically forced systems and offers
   new insights relative to modal approaches. To improve upon the
   limitations of conventional wide-area control strategies, we also study
   the problem of signal selection and optimal design of sparse and
   block-sparse wide-area controllers. In our design, we preserve
   rotational symmetry of the power system by allowing only relative angle
   measurements in the distributed controllers. For the IEEE 39 New England
   model, we examine performance tradeoffs and robustness of different
   control architectures and show that optimal retuning of
   fully-decentralized control strategies can effectively guard against
   local and inter-area oscillations.}},

Abstract = {{Grid security and open markets are two major smart grid goals.
   Transparency of market data facilitates a competitive and efficient
   energy environment. But it may also reveal critical physical system
   information. Recovering the grid topology based solely on publicly
   available market data is explored here. Real-time energy prices are
   typically calculated as the Lagrange multipliers of network-constrained
   economic dispatch; that is, via a linear program (LP) typically solved
   every 5 min. Since the grid Laplacian matrix is a parameter of this LP,
   someone apart from the system operator could try inferring this
   topology-related matrix upon observing successive LP dual outcomes. It
   is first shown that the matrix of spatio-temporal prices can be factored
   as the product of the inverse Laplacian times a sparse matrix.
   Leveraging results from sparse matrix decompositions, topology recovery
   schemes with complementary strengths are subsequently formulated.
   Solvers scalable to high-dimensional and streaming market data are
   devised. Numerical validation using synthetic and real-load data on the
   IEEE 30-bus grid provide useful input for current and future market
   designs.}},

Abstract = {{The concurrent propagation of the aromatics-based and olefins-based
   catalytic cycles at early stages of the methanol-to-olefins reaction
   over HSAPO-34 and the resulting consequences on light olefins
   selectivities are demonstrated with C-13(3)-propylene/C-12(2)-dimethyl
   ether isotopic tracing studies at 6231( and sub-complete dimethyl ether
   conversions. Transients in effluent product selectivities were
   rationalized by the maturation of the entrained hydrocarbon pool where
   catalyst turnover number is introduced as a compendious descriptor of
   hydrocarbon pool maturity and reaction progress. The distinct
   C-13-content of ethylene from other effluent products and its agreement
   with the C-13-content of entrained polymethylbenzenes indicate that
   ethylene is a product of aromatics-based dealkylation events while the
   match between methylation-predicted and experimentally observed
   C-13-contents for C5+ olefins establishes that they are products of
   olefins-based methylation events. Methanol-to-olefins conversion
   proceeds through a dual cycle mechanism proposed earlier for methanol
   conversion over other solid acid catalysts where the topology of
   HSAPO-34 specifically engenders the prevalence of the aromatics-based

Title = {{Preferential activation of CO near hydrocarbon chains during
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis on Ru}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{337}},
Pages = {{91-101}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We report here theoretical evidence for an enhancement in CO activation
   to form C-1 monomers at locations near growing hydrocarbon chains as a
   result of their ability to disrupt the dense monolayers of chemisorbed
   CO{*} present during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS). These previously
   unrecognized routes become favored at the high CO{*} coverages that
   prevail on curved cluster surfaces at conditions of FTS practice and
   account for the rapid growth of chains, which requires a source of
   vicinal monomers. CO activation initially requires a vacant site (and
   consequently CO{*} desorption) and proceeds via CO{*} reactions with
   H{*} to form hydroxymethylene (CH{*}OH{*}), which then dissociates to
   form OH{*} and CH{*}: CH; species can subsequently act as monomers and
   insert into chains, a process denoted as the `carbene' mechanism. These
   CH{*}, and their larger alkylidyne (CnH2n-1{*}) homologs, disrupt the
   dense CO{*} adlayers and in doing so allow the facile formation of
   vicinal CH{*}OH{*} intermediates that mediate CO activation, without
   requiring, in this case, CO{*} desorption. This causes CO{*} activation
   effective enthalpy and free energy barriers to be similar to 100 and
   similar to 15 kJ mol(-1) lower, respectively, near growing chains than
   within unperturbed monolayers. These effects are observed near
   alkylidyne (CnH2n-1{*}) but not alkylidene (CnH2n{*}) or alkyl
   (CnH2n-1{*}) chains. These phenomena cause monomers to form
   preferentially near growing alkylidyne chains, instead of forming at
   undisrupted regions of CO{*} monolayers, causing chain growth (via
   CHX{*}-insertion) to occur much more rapidly than chain initiation, a
   requirement to form long chains. Such routes resolve the seemingly
   contradictory proposals that CHx{*} species act as monomers (instead of
   CO{*}) and chain initiators, but their formation and diffusion on dense
   CO{*} adlayers must occur much faster than chain initiation for such
   chains to grow fast and reach large average lengths. Chains disrupt
   surrounding molecules in the adlayer, causing faster monomer formation
   precisely at locations where they can readily react with growing chains.
   This work illustrates how interactions between transition states and
   co-adsorbates can dramatically affect predicted rates and selectivities
   at the high coverages relevant to practical catalysis. Published by

Abstract = {{Denitrifying bioreactors can be effective for removing nitrate from
   agricultural tile drainage; however, questions about cold springtime
   performance persist. The objective of this study was to improve the
   nitrate removal rate (NRR) of denitrifying bioreactors at warm and cold
   temperatures using agriculturally derived media rather than wood chips
   (WC). Corn (Zea mays L.) cobs (CC), corn stover (CS), barley (Hordeum
   vulgare L.) straw (BS), WC, and CC followed by a compartment of WC
   (CC+WC) were tested in laboratory columns for 5 mo at a 12-h hydraulic
   residence time in separate experiments at 15.5 and 1.5 degrees C.
   Nitrate-N removal rates ranged from 35 to 1.4 at 15.5 degrees C and from
   7.4 to 1.6 g N m(-3) d(-1) at 1.5 degrees C, respectively; NRRs were
   ranked CC > CC+WC > BS = CS > WC and CC = CC+WC = CS = BS > WC for 15.5
   and 1.5 degrees C, respectively. Although NRRs for CC were increased
   relative to WC, CC released greater amounts of carbon. Greater abundance
   of nitrous oxide (N2O) reductase gene (nosZ) was supported by crop
   residues than WC at 15.5 degrees C, and CS and BS supported greater
   abundance than WC at 1.5 degrees C. Production of N2O relative to
   nitrate removal (rN(2)O) was consistently greater at 1.5 degrees C
   (7.5\% of nitrate removed) than at 15.5 degrees C (1.9\%). The rN(2)O
   was lowest in CC (1.1\%) and CC-WC (0.9\%) and greatest in WC (9.7\%).
   Using a compartment of agricultural residue media in series before wood
   chips has the potential to improve denitrifying bioreactor nitrate
   removal rates, but field-scale verification is needed.}},

Title = {{Improved methods to estimate the effective impervious area in urban

Abstract = {{Impervious surfaces are useful indicators of the urbanization impacts on
   water resources. Effective impervious area (EIA), which is the portion
   of total impervious area (TIA) that is hydraulically connected to the
   drainage system, is a better catchment parameter in the determination of
   actual urban runoff. Development of reliable methods for quantifying EIA
   rather than TIA is currently one of the knowledge gaps in the
   rainfall-runoff modeling context. The objective of this study is to
   improve the rainfall runoff data analysis method for estimating EIA
   fraction in urban catchments by eliminating the subjective part of the
   existing method and by reducing the uncertainty of EIA estimates. First,
   the theoretical framework is generalized using a general linear least
   square model and using a general criterion for categorizing runoff
   events. Issues with the existing method that reduce the precision of the
   EIA fraction estimates are then identified and discussed. Two improved
   methods, based on ordinary least square (OLS) and weighted least square
   (WLS) estimates, are proposed to address these issues. The proposed
   weighted least squares method is then applied to eleven urban catchments
   in Europe, Canada, and Australia. The results are compared to map
   measured directly connected impervious area (DCIA) and are shown to be
   consistent with DCIA values. In addition, both of the improved methods
   are applied to nine urban catchments in Minnesota, USA. Both methods
   were successful in removing the subjective component inherent in the
   analysis of rainfall-runoff data of the current method. The WLS method
   is more robust than the OLS method and generates results that are
   different and more precise than the OLS method in the presence of
   heteroscedastic residuals in our rainfall-runoff data. (C) 2016 Elsevier

   microheaters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MICROMECHANICS AND MICROENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{High temperature microheaters have been designed and constructed to
   reduce the background thermal emission radiation produced by the heater.
   Such heaters allow one to probe luminescence with very low numbers of
   photons where the background emission would overwhelm the desired
   signal. Two methods to reduce background emission are described: one
   with low emission materials and the other with interference coating
   design. The first uses platforms composed of material that is
   transparent to mid-infrared light and therefore of low emissivity.
   Heating elements are embedded in the periphery of the heater. The
   transparent platform is composed of aluminum oxide, which is largely
   transparent for wavelengths less than about 8 mu m. In the luminescent
   microscopy used to test the heater, an optical aperture blocks emission
   from the heating coils while passing light from the heated objects on
   the transparent center of the microheater. The amount of infrared light
   transmitted through the aperture was reduced by 90\% as the aperture was
   moved from the highly emissive heater coils at 450 degrees C to the
   largely transparent center at the same temperature. The second method
   uses microheaters with integrated multilayer interference structures
   designed to limit background emission in the spectral range of the
   low-light luminescence object being measured. These heaters were
   composed of aluminum oxide, titanium dioxide, and platinum and were
   operated over a large range of temperatures, from 50 degrees C to 600
   degrees C. At 600 degrees C, they showed a background photon emission
   only 1/800 that of a comparison heater without the multilayer
   interference structure. In this structure, the radiation background was
   sufficiently reduced to easily monitor weak thermoluminescent emission
   from CaSO4:Ce, Tb microparticles.}},

Abstract = {{A cyclic stretch and perfusion bioreactor was designed to culture large
   diameter engineered tissue tubes for heart valve applications. In this
   bioreactor, tubular tissues consisting of dermal fibroblasts in a
   sacrificial fibrin gel scaffold were placed over porated latex support
   sleeves and mounted in a custom bioreactor. Pulsatile flow of culture
   medium into the system resulted in cyclic stretching as well as
   ablumenal, lumenal, and transmural flow (perfusion). In this study,
   lumenal remodeling, composition, and mechanical strength and stiffness
   were compared for tissues cyclically stretched in this bioreactor on
   either the porated latex sleeves or solid latex sleeves, which did not
   permit lumenal or transmural flow. Tissues cyclically stretched on
   porated sleeves had regions of increased lumenal remodeling and
   cellularity that were localized to the columns of pores in the latex
   sleeve. A CFD model was developed with COMSOL Multiphysics(A (R)) to
   predict flow of culture medium in and around the tissue, and the
   predictions suggest that the enhanced lumenal remodeling was likely a
   result of elevated shear stresses and transmural velocity in these
   regions. This work highlights the beneficial effects of increased
   nutrient transport and flow stimulation for accelerating in vitro tissue
   remodeling.}},

Abstract = {{Neurophysiological changes in the basal ganglia thalamo-cortical circuit
   associated with the development of parkinsonian motor signs remain
   poorly understood. Theoretical models have ranged from those emphasizing
   changes in mean discharge rate to increased oscillatory activity within
   the beta range. The present study characterized neuronal activity within
   and across the internal and external segments of the globus pallidus as
   a function of motor severity using a staged, progressively severe
   1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine model of Parkinsonism in
   three rhesus monkeys. An increase in coherence between neuronal pairs
   across the external and internal globus pallidus was present in multiple
   frequency bands in the parkinsonian state; both the peak frequency of
   oscillatory coherence and the variability were reduced in the
   parkinsonian state. The incidence of 820 Hz oscillatory activity in the
   internal globus pallidus increased with the progression of the disease
   when pooling the data across the three animals; however it did not
   correlate with motor severity when assessed individually and increased
   progressively in only one of three animals. No systematic relationship
   between mean discharge rates or the incidence or structure of bursting
   activity and motor severity was observed. These data suggest that
   exaggerated coupling across pallidal segments contribute to the
   development of the parkinsonian state by inducing an exaggerated level
   of synchrony and loss of focusing within the basal ganglia. These data
   further point to the lack of a defined relationship between rate
   changes, the mere presence of oscillatory activity in the beta range and
   bursting activity in the basal ganglia to the motor signs of Parkinson's
   disease. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel quartz based micro catalytic methane sensor with back-etched
   cone-shaped cavity was fabricated by high-resolution abrasive sand
   blasting technique. Highly uniform micro cavities were easily and
   quickly achieved with a depth of 450 mu m and a bottom diameter of 600
   mu m on a quartz substrate 500 mu m thick, followed by screen printing
   porous alumina with a position accuracy of 10 mu m and inkjet printing
   of co-metal catalyst with loading quantity resolution of 4.75 ng.
   Compared with a bulk quartz substrate sensor, performance of the sensor
   fabricated by abrasive sand blasting is greatly improved with a lower
   thermal mass. The sensor's temperature distribution profile is more
   concentrated on target catalyst, power consumption decreases to 285 mW
   by 23\%, thermal response time decreases to 8.8 s by 79\%, and
   sensitivity to methane increases to 1.83 mV/\% CH4 by 35\%, with a high
   correlation coefficient up to 0.9986. Moreover, this sensor demonstrates
   excellent resistance to mechanical shock at high working temperatures,
   significantly superior to conventional silicon based membrane sensors.
   This design of the high performance sensor, together with the simple and
   fast MEMS-compatible fabrication process enables such catalytic sensors
   for mass production and combustible gas detecting in harsh environmental
   applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices emerge as data descriptors in
   several applications of computer vision such as object tracking, texture
   recognition, and diffusion tensor imaging. Clustering these data
   matrices forms an integral part of these applications, for which
   soft-clustering algorithms (K-Means, expectation maximization, etc.) are
   generally used. As is well-known, these algorithms need the number of
   clusters to be specified, which is difficult when the dataset scales. To
   address this issue, we resort to the classical nonparametric Bayesian
   framework by modeling the data as a mixture model using the Dirichlet
   process (DP) prior. Since these matrices do not conform to the Euclidean
   geometry, rather belongs to a curved Riemannian manifold, existing DP
   models cannot be directly applied. Thus, in this paper, we propose a
   novel DP mixture model framework for SPD matrices. Using the
   log-determinant divergence as the underlying dissimilarity measure to
   compare these matrices, and further using the connection between this
   measure and the Wishart distribution, we derive a novel DPM model based
   on the Wishart-Inverse-Wishart conjugate pair. We apply this model to
   several applications in computer vision. Our experiments demonstrate
   that our model is scalable to the dataset size and at the same time
   achieves superior accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art
   parametric and nonparametric clustering algorithms.}},

   establish the distinct contributions of each by decoupling the
   contributions from BA and BS.
   To modulate BA, a SoluplusA (R) powder was compressed into tablets at
   different temperatures and then broken following equilibration at 25A
   degrees C. To modulate BS, tablets were equilibrated at different
   temperatures. To simultaneously modulate BA and BS, both powder
   compression and tablet breaking test were carried out at different
   temperatures.
   Lower tablet tensile strength is observed when the powder is compressed
   at a lower temperature but broken at 25A degrees C. This is consistent
   with the increased resistance to polymer deformation at lower
   temperatures. When equilibrated at different temperatures, the tensile
   strength of tablets prepared under identical conditions increases with
   decreasing storage temperature, indicating that BS is higher at a lower
   temperature. When powder compression and tablet breaking are carried out
   at the same temperature, the profile with a maximum tensile strength at
   4A degrees C is observed due to the BA-BS interplay.
   By systematically varying temperature during tablet compression and
   breaking, we have experimentally demonstrated the phenomenon of BA-BS
   interplay in tableting.}},

Abstract = {{The finiteness of fossil fuels implies that future electric power
   systems may predominantly source energy from fuel-free renewable
   resources like wind and solar. Evidently, these power systems without
   fuel will be environmentally benign, sustainable, and subject to milder
   failure scenarios. Many of these advantages were projected decades ago
   with the definition of the soft energy path, which describes a future
   where all energy is provided by numerous small, simple, and diverse
   renewable sources. Here we provide a thorough investigation of power
   systems without any fuel-based generation from technical and economic
   standpoints. The paper is organized by timescale and covers issues like
   the irrelevance of unit commitment in networks without large, fuel-based
   generators, the dubiousness of nodal pricing without fuel costs, and the
   need for new system-level models and control methods for
   semiconductor-based energy-conversion interfaces. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Title = {{Pretreatment gut microbiome predicts chemotherapy-related bloodstream
   infection}},
Journal = {{GENOME MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{APR 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Bacteremia, or bloodstream infection (BSI), is a leading
   cause of death among patients with certain types of cancer. A previous
   study reported that intestinal domination, defined as occupation of at
   least 30 \% of the microbiota by a single bacterial taxon, is associated
   with BSI in patients undergoing allo-HSCT. However, the impact of the
   intestinal microbiome before treatment initiation on the risk of
   subsequent BSI remains unclear. Our objective was to characterize the
   fecal microbiome collected before treatment to identify microbes that
   predict the risk of BSI.
   Methods: We sampled 28 patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma undergoing
   allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) prior to
   administration of chemotherapy and characterized 16S ribosomal RNA genes
   using high-throughput DNA sequencing. We quantified bacterial taxa and
   used techniques from machine learning to identify microbial biomarkers
   that predicted subsequent BSI.
   Results: We found that patients who developed subsequent BSI exhibited
   decreased overall diversity and decreased abundance of taxa including
   Barnesiellaceae, Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibacterium, Christensenella,
   Dehalobacterium, Desulfovibrio, and Sutterella. Using machine-learning
   methods, we developed a BSI risk index capable of predicting BSI
   incidence with a sensitivity of 90 \% at a specificity of 90 \% based
   only on the pretreatment fecal microbiome.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the gut microbiota can identify
   high-risk patients before HSCT and that manipulation of the gut
   microbiota for prevention of BSI in high-risk patients may be a useful
   direction for future research. This approach may inspire the development
   of similar microbiome-based diagnostic and prognostic models in other
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Vapor deposited thin films of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) were
   investigated using transient absorption spectroscopy. Exciton-exciton
   annihilation dominated the kinetics at high exciton densities. When
   annihilation was minimized, the observed lifetime was measured to be 8.6
   +/- 0.6 ns, which is over an order of magnitude longer than previous
   reports. In comparison with metal free phthalocyanine (H2Pc), the data
   show evidence that the presence of copper induces an ultrafast
   relaxation process taking place on the ca. 500 fs timescale. By
   comparison to recent time-resolved photoemission studies, this is
   assigned as ultrafast intersystem crossing. As the intersystem crossing
   occurs ca. 10(4) times faster than lifetime decay, it is likely that
   triplets are the dominant excitons in vapor deposited CuPc films. The
   exciton lifetime of CuPc thin films is ca. 35 times longer than H2Pc
   thin films, while the diffusion lengths reported in the literature are
   typically quite similar for the two materials. These findings suggest
   that despite appearing to be similar materials at first glance, CuPc and
   H2Pc may transport energy in dramatically different ways. This has
   important implications on the design and mechanistic understanding of
   devices where phthalocyanines are used as an excitonic material.}},

Abstract = {{The coordinated interactions between individuals are fundamental for the
   success of the activities in some professional categories. We reported
   on brain-to-brain cooperative interactions between civil pilots during a
   simulated flight. We demonstrated for the first time how the combination
   of neuroelectrical hyperscanning and intersubject connectivity could
   provide indicators sensitive to the humans' degree of synchronization
   under a highly demanding task performed in an ecological environment.
   Our results showed how intersubject connectivity was able to i)
   characterize the degree of cooperation between pilots in different
   phases of the flight, and ii) to highlight the role of specific brain
   macro areas in cooperative behavior. During the most cooperative flight
   phases pilots showed, in fact, dense patterns of interbrain
   connectivity, mainly linking frontal and parietal brain areas. On the
   contrary, the amount of interbrain connections went close to zero in the
   non-cooperative phase. The reliability of the interbrain connectivity
   patterns was verified by means of a baseline condition represented by
   formal couples, i. e. pilots paired offline for the connectivity
   analysis but not simultaneously recorded during the flight. Interbrain
   density was, in fact, significantly higher in real couples with respect
   to formal couples in the cooperative flight phases. All the achieved
   results demonstrated how the description of brain networks at the basis
   of cooperation could effectively benefit from a hyperscanning approach.
   Interbrain connectivity was, in fact, more informative in the
   investigation of cooperative behavior with respect to established EEG
   signal processing methodologies applied at a single subject level.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate the large bending deformation induced by an array of
   permanent magnets (applied field similar to 0.02 T) designed to minimize
   poles in the bent state of the crystal. Planar cantilevers of NiMnGa (5M
   modulated martensite) ferromagnetic shape memory alloy deform into an
   arched shape according to theory, with a zig-zag microstructure that
   complies with the kinematic and magnetic compatibility between adjacent
   twin variants. A general theory of bent and twisted states is given,
   applicable to both twinning and austenite/martensite transformations.
   Some of these configurations achieve order-of-magnitude amplification of
   rotation and axial strain. We investigate also atomistic analogues of
   these bent and twisted configurations with perfect interfaces between
   phases. These mechanisms of large deformation, induced by small magnetic
   fields or temperature changes, have potential application to the
   development of new actuation technologies for micro-robotic systems.}},

   simulations are utilized to investigate the thermal transport between
   aqueous solutions and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB)or

   heat diffusion model, which incorporates the interfacial thermal
   conductances predicted by molecular dynamics. According to our
   observations, the effective thermal conductance of the GNR/PEG/water
   system is higher than that of the GNR/CTAB/water system with a
   surfactant layer of the same length. We attribute the enhancement of
   thermal transport to the larger thermal conductance at the GNR/PEG
   interface as compared with that at the GNR/CTAB interface, in addition
   to the water penetration into the hydrophilic PEG layer. Our results
   highlight the role of the GNR/polymer thermal interfaces in designing
   biological and composite-based heat transfer applications of GNRs, and

Abstract = {{Common approaches in designing natural gas dryers are based on empirical
   algebraic correlations and design heuristics. Such approaches fail to
   capture the process physics and are generally not optimal. In this work
   a new method for the design of natural gas dryers is presented. The
   method formulates a mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem
   where the objective is to minimize the net present value of ensued costs
   (NPVC) of the drying system throughout its lifetime, while meeting all
   process constraints. Two process schemes based on common industrial
   conditions are considered, which differ in the source of the
   regeneration gas. Both schemes are shown to attain an optimal NPVC in
   the range of 4.5 to 5.4 \$/MMSCF. When compared to conventional methods,
   this represents a reduction in the range of 17- 37\%. The cost savings
   are primarily achieved from the optimization of the adsorption time,
   regeneration time, and the regeneration gas flow rate, thus illustrating
   the advantages of the proposed optimal design.}},

Title = {{Water-in-Oil Microstructures Formed by Marine Oil Dispersants in a Model
   Crude Oil}},
Journal = {{LANGMUIR}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{16}},
Pages = {{3954-3962}},

Abstract = {{DOSS (dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate), Tween 80, and Span 80, surfactants
   commonly used in marine crude oil spill dispersants, have been mixed
   into a model oil at a total surfactant concentration of 2 wt \%, typical
   for dispersant-treated oil slicks. These surfactant-oil blends also
   contained 0.5-1.5 wt \% synthetic seawater to enable formation of
   water-in-oil (W/O) microstructures. Trends in dynamic oil seawater
   interfacial tension (IFT) as a function of surfactant blend composition
   are similar to those observed in prior work for crude oil treated with
   similar blends of these surfactants. In particular, Span 80-rich
   surfactant blends exhibit much slower initial dynamic IFT decline than
   DOSS-rich surfactant blends in both model oil and crude oil, and
   surfactant blends containing 50 wt \% Tween 80 and a DOSS:Span 80 ratio
   near 1:1 produce ultralow IFT in the model oil (<10(-4) mN/m) just as
   similar surfactant blends do in crude oil. At all DOSS:Span 80 ratios,
   surfactant blends containing 50 wt \% Tween 80 form clear solutions with
   seawater in the model oil. Cryo-transmission electron microscopy
   (cryo-TEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) show that these solutions
   contain spherical W/O microstructures, the size and dispersity of which
   vary with surfactant blend composition and surfactant:seawater molar
   ratio. Span 80-rich microstructures exhibit high polydispersity index
   (PDI > 0.2) and large diameters (>= 100 nm), whereas DOSS-rich
   microstructures exhibit smaller diameters (20-40 nm) and low
   polydispersity index (PDI < 0.1), indicating a narrow microstructure
   size distribution. The smaller diameters of DOSS-rich microstructures,
   as well as the fact that DOSS molecules, being oil-soluble, can diffuse
   to a bulk oil water interface as monomers much faster than any of these
   microstructures, may explain why DOSS-rich blends adsorb to the oil
   water interface more quickly than Span 80-rich blends, a phenomenon
   which has been linked in prior work to the higher effectiveness of
   DOSS-rich Tween/Span/DOSS-based oil dispersants.}},

   production of the di-tert-butyl ethers and tri-tert-butyl ether of
   glycerol. The resulting mixed-integer nonlinear program enables
   simultaneous determination of values of key decision variables including
   number of column trays, feed tray location of column, volume of reactor,
   process flowrates etc. The optimal design leads to a minimal production
   cost of glycerol ethers of 1.201 \$/kg, which is dominated by the cost

Abstract = {{The oxidation and reduction of Ru(0001) surfaces at the confined space
   between two-dimensional nanoporous silica frameworks and Ru(0001) have
   been investigated using synchrotron-based ambient pressure X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy (AP-XPS). The porous nature of the frameworks
   and the weak interaction between the silica and the ruthenium substrate
   allow oxygen and hydrogen molecules to go through the nanopores and
   react with the metal at the interface between the silica framework and
   the metal surface. In this work, three types of two-dimensional silica
   frameworks have been used to study their influence in the oxidation and
   reduction of the ruthenium surface at elevated pressures and
   temperatures. These frameworks are bilayer silica (0.5 nm thick),
   bilayer aluminosilicate (0.5 um thick), and zeolite MFI nanosheets (3 nm
   thick). It is found that the silica frameworks stay essentially intact
   under these conditions, but they strongly affect the oxidation of
   ruthenium, with the 0.5 nm thick aluminosilicate bilayer completely
   inhibiting the oxidation. The latter is believed to be related to the
   lower chemisorbed oxygen content arising from electrostatic interactions
   between the negatively charged aluminosilicate framework and the
   Ru(0001) substrate.}},

Title = {{Role of impurities in determining the exciton diffusion length in
   organic semiconductors}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{16}},
Month = {{APR 16}},
Abstract = {{The design and performance of organic photovoltaic cells is dictated, in
   part, by the magnitude of the exciton diffusion length (L-D). Despite
   the importance of this parameter, there have been few investigations
   connecting L-D and materials purity. Here, we investigate L-D for the
   organic small molecule
   N,N'-bis(naphthalen-1-yl)-N,N'-bis(phenyl)-benzidine as native
   impurities are systematically removed from the material. Thin films
   deposited from the as-synthesized material yield a value for L-D, as
   measured by photoluminescence quenching, of (3.9 +/- 0.5) nm with a
   corresponding photoluminescence efficiency (eta(PL)) of (25 +/- 1)\% and
   thin film purity of (97.1 +/- 1.2)\%, measured by high performance
   liquid chromatography. After purification by thermal gradient
   sublimation, the value of L-D is increased to (4.7 +/- 0.5) nm with a
   corresponding eta(PL) of (33 +/- 1)\% and purity of (98.3 +/- 0.8)\%.
   Interestingly, a similar behavior is also observed as a function of the
   deposition boat temperature. Films deposited from the purified material
   at a high temperature give L-D = (5.3 +/- 0.8) nm with eta(PL) = (37 +/-
   1)\% for films with a purity of (99.0 +/- 0.3)\% purity. Using a model
   of diffusion by Forster energy transfer, the variation of L-D with
   purity is predicted as a function of eta(PL) and is in good agreement
   with measurements. The removal of impurities acts to decrease the
   non-radiative exciton decay rate and increase the radiative decay rate,
   leading to increases in both the diffusivity and exciton lifetime. The
   results of this work highlight the role of impurities in determining
   L-D, while also providing insight into the degree of materials
   purification necessary to achieve optimized exciton transport. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{The coordination of cell cycle progression with the repair of DNA damage
   supports the genomic integrity of dividing cells. The function of many
   factors involved in DNA damage response (DDR) and the cell cycle depends
   on their Ran GTPase-regulated nuclear-cytoplasmic transport (NCT). The
   loading of Ran with GTP, which is mediated by RCC1, the guanine
   nucleotide exchange factor for Ran, is critical for NCT activity.
   However, the role of RCC1 or Ran.GTP in promoting cell proliferation or
   DDR is not clear. We show that RCC1 overexpression in normal cells
   increased cellular Ran.GTP levels and accelerated the cell cycle and DNA
   damage repair. As a result, normal cells overexpressing RCC1 evaded DNA
   damage- induced cell cycle arrest and senescence, mimicking colorectal
   carcinoma cells with high endogenous RCC1 levels. The RCC1-induced
   inhibition of senescence required Ran and exportin 1 and involved the
   activation of importin beta-dependent nuclear import of 53BP1, a large
   NCT cargo. Our results indicate that changes in the activity of the
   Ran.GTP-regulated NCT modulate the rate of the cell cycle and the
   efficiency of DNA repair. Through the essential role of RCC1 in
   regulation of cellular Ran.GTP levels and NCT, RCC1 expression enables
   the proliferation of cells that sustain DNA damage.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of distributed Bayesian estimation
   in networks of agents over a given undirected graph. The agents observe
   data represented by a general linear model with unknown covariance
   matrices. The agents try to reach consensus on the belief on the unknown
   linear parameters based on their private signals and information
   provided by their neighbors. The belief is defined by the posterior
   distribution of the parameters. After deriving the Bayesian belief held
   by a fictitious fusion center, we present a consensus-based solution
   where the agents reach the belief of the fusion center. According to our
   scheme, at every time instant, each agent carries out three operations:
   a) receives private noisy measurements; b) exchanges information about
   its belief with its neighbors; and c) updates its belief with the new
   information. We show that with the proposed method, the Kullback-Leibler
   divergence between the beliefs of the agents and the fusion center
   converges to zero. We demonstrate the performance of the method by
   computer simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Most real-world networks exhibit community structure, a phenomenon
   characterized by existence of node clusters whose intra-edge
   connectivity is stronger than edge connectivities between nodes
   belonging to different clusters. In addition to facilitating a better
   understanding of network behavior, community detection finds many
   practical applications in diverse settings. Communities in online social
   networks are indicative of shared functional roles, or affiliation to a
   common socio-economic status, the knowledge of which is vital for
   targeted advertisement. In buyer-seller networks, community detection
   facilitates better product recommendations. Unfortunately, reliability
   of community assignments is hindered by anomalous user behavior often
   observed as unfair self-promotion, or ``fake{''} highly-connected
   accounts created to promote fraud. The present paper advocates a novel
   approach for jointly tracking communities while detecting such anomalous
   nodes in time-varying networks. By postulating edge creation as the
   result of mutual community participation by node pairs, a dynamic factor
   model with anomalous memberships captured through a sparse outlier
   matrix is put forth. Efficient tracking algorithms suitable for both
   online and decentralized operation are developed. Experiments conducted
   on both synthetic and real network time series successfully unveil
   underlying communities and anomalous nodes.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional compressive sensing (CS) methods assume the data sparsity to
   be constant over time, which holds well in many long-term scenarios.
   However, the authors' recent study on electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring
   reveals that data sparsity varies dramatically for real-time monitoring
   systems where the data latency must be bounded, due to limited data
   collected within the delay bound. The variation of data sparsity makes
   the reconstruction error (RE) unstable. Furthermore, the variation of
   wireless channel quality also impacts the reconstruction quality. To
   accommodate both variations, this study proposes a novel adaptive
   feedback architecture for real-time wireless ECG monitoring based on the
   CS technique, which can bound the REs in the presence of the variations
   of data sparsity and wireless channel. An experiment testbed has been
   built to evaluate the performance of the proposed system. The results
   show that the data latency can be limited to <300 ms and the RE can be
   controlled to 9\%.}},

Abstract = {{We present large-scale reproducible fabrication Magnetic of
   multifunctional ultrasharp metallic structures on planar Trapping
   substrates with capabilities including magnetic field nano focusing and
   plasmonic sensing. Objects with sharp tips such as wedges and pyramids
   made with noble metals have been extensively used for enhancing local
   electric fields via the lightning-rod effect or plasmonic nanofocusing.
   However, analogous nanofocusing of magnetic fields using sharp tips made
   with magnetic materials has not been widely realized. Reproducible
   fabrication of sharp tips with magnetic as well as noble metal layers on
   planar substrates can enable straightforward application of their
   material and shape-derived functionalities. We use a template-stripping
   method to produce plasmonic-shell-coated nickel wedge and pyramid arrays
   at the wafer-scale with tip radius of curvature close to 10 nm. We
   further explore the magnetic nanofocusing capabilities of these
   ultrasharp substrates, deriving analytical formulas and comparing the
   results with computer simulations. These structures exhibit nanoscale
   spatial control over the trapping of magnetic microbeads and
   nanoparticles in solution. Additionally, enhanced optical sensing of
   analytes by these plasmonic-shell-coated substrates is demonstrated
   using surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. These methods can guide the
   design and fabrication of novel devices with applications including
   nanoparticle manipulation, biosensing, and magnetoplasmonics.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a facile route to asymmetric polymersomes by blending AC
   and BC block copolymers in oil-in-oil emulsions containing polystyrene
   (PS) and polybutadiene (PB) in chloroform (CHCl3). Polymersomes were
   prepared by mixing polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (SO) and
   polybutadiene-b-poly-(ethylene oxide) (BO) in the oil-in-oil emulsion,
   where the droplets and continuous phase are PS-and PB-rich,
   respectively. The polymersome structure was directly visualized using
   dye-labeled SO and BO with confocal fluorescence microscopy; SO and BO
   with a high O block fraction co-assemble to produce asymmetric
   polymersomes. As the O block is insoluble in both PS and PB, we infer
   that the detailed structure of the polymersomes is a bilayer in which
   the S and B blocks face the PS-inner and PB-outer phases, respectively,
   while the common O blocks form the core membrane. This structure is only
   observed for sufficiently long O blocks. It is remarkable that although
   all the polymers are soluble in CHCl3, such elaborate structures are
   created by straightforward co-assembly. These asymmetric polymersomes
   should provide robust bilayer membranes around emulsion droplets,
   leading to stable nanoscopic dispersions of two fluids.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{6}},

Abstract = {{Despite abundant research conducted on cancer biomarker discovery and
   validation, to date, less than two-dozen biomarkers have been approved
   by the FDA for clinical use. One main reason is attributed to
   inadvertent use of low quality biospecimens in biomarker research. Most
   proteinaceous biomarkers are extremely susceptible to pre-analytical
   factors such as collection, processing, and storage. For example,
   cryogenic storage imposes very harsh chemical, physical, and mechanical
   stresses on biospecimens, significantly compromising sample quality. In
   this communication, we report the development of an electrospun
   lyoprotectant matrix and isothermal vitrification methodology for
   non-cryogenic stabilization and storage of liquid biospecimens. The
   lyoprotectant matrix was mainly composed of trehalose and dextran (and
   various low concentration excipients targeting different mechanisms of
   damage), and it was engineered to minimize heterogeneity during
   vitrification. The technology was validated using five biomarkers; LDH,
   CRP, PSA, MMP-7, and C3a. Complete recovery of LDH, CRP, and PSA levels
   was achieved post-rehydration while more than 90\% recovery was
   accomplished for MMP-7 and C3a, showing promise for isothermal
   vitrification as a safe, efficient, and low-cost alternative to
   cryogenic storage.}},

Abstract = {{We have spectroscopically determined the optical bandgaps and band
   offsets at epitaxial interfaces of BaSnO3 with SrTiO3(001) and
   LaAlO3(001). 28 u.c. BaSnO3 epitaxial films exhibit direct and indirect
   bandgaps of 3.56 +/- 0.05 eV and 2.93 +/- 0.05 eV, respectively. The
   lack of a significant Burstein-Moss shift corroborates the highly
   insulating, defect-free nature of the BaSnO3 films. The conduction band
   minimum is lower in electron energy in 5 u.c. films of BaSnO3 than in
   SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 by 0.4 +/- 0.2 eV and 3.7 +/- 0.2 eV, respectively.
   This result bodes well for the realization of oxide-based,
   high-mobility, two-dimensional electron systems that can operate at
   ambient temperature, since electrons generated in the SrTiO3 by
   modulation doping, or at the BaSnO3/LaAlO3 interface by polarization
   doping, can be transferred to and at least partially confined in the
   BaSnO3 film. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{The processional magnetization induced spin current at the interface
   between CoFeB and Ta has been studied experimentally using spin pumping
   and inverse spin Hall effect for different thicknesses of CoFeB film
   down to 1.6 nm. It is found that upon decreasing the thickness of the
   CoFeB, the frequency of the peak position of the spin pumping signal
   reduces and dispersion relation of the ferromagnetic resonance changes
   from a quadratic to a linear behavior indicating the presence of an
   interfacial perpendicular anisotropy. Furthermore, a nonreciprocal
   behavior between the spin pumping signal amplitude at positive and
   negative fields is observed which could be as large as 100\%. Our
   experimental results suggest reduction of the effective demagnetization
   field and possibly the spin waves nonreciprocal behavior mediated by the
   Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction at the Ta/CoFeB interface are
   responsible for the large nonreciprocity of the spin pumping signal. (C)

   the analytical formulas over the experimental results, it is found that
   the anti-damping torque, also known as spin Hall effect, is sizable
   while a negligible field-like torque is observed. A spin Hall angle of
   about 18 +/- 0.6\% is obtained for the Ta layer. Temperature dependent
   study of the spin orbital torques is also performed. It is found that
   temperature does not significantly modify the spin Hall angle. By
   cooling down the sample down to 100K, the obtained spin Hall angle has a
   maximum value of about 20.560.43\%. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{This work identifies a benchmark for the performance of a small-scale
   ammonia synthesis plant powered by wind energy. The energy used is
   stranded, far from urban centers but near locations of fertilizer
   demand. The wind energy drives the pressure swing absorption of air to
   make nitrogen and the electrolysis of water to make hydrogen. These are
   combined in the small-scale continuous Haber process to synthesize
   ammonia. The analysis of runs of the small plant presented in this
   article permits an assessment of how the current production rate is
   controlled by three resistances: catalytic reaction, ammonia separation
   by condensation, and recycling of unreacted gas. The measured catalytic
   reaction rates are consistent with separate experiments on chemical
   kinetics and with published reaction mechanisms The condensation rates
   predicted are comparable with literature correlations. These rate
   constants now supply a rigorous strategy for optimizing this
   scaled-down, distributed ammonia plant. Moreover, this method of
   analysis is recommended for future small-scale, distributed
   manufacturing plants.}},

Abstract = {{In this investigation, we summarize performance parameters of 24 TSI
   CPCs model 3772 and 9 TSI CPCs model 3790 determined at the World
   Calibration Aerosol Centre Physics hosted by the Leibniz Institute for
   Tropospheric Research. Model 3790 CPCs are basically identical to model
   3772 laminar continuous flow type butanol-based CPCs with a modified
   temperature difference between saturator and condenser. The average 50\%
   detection efficiency for silver particles for 3772 and 3790 instruments
   was found to be 7.52 +/- 0.04 nm and 24.34 +/- 0.29 nm (average mobility
   diameter +/- standard deviation), respectively. Small changes of the
   temperature difference between saturator and condenser cause larger
   shifts of the 50\% detection efficiencies of 3790 CPCs compared to 3772
   CPCs. In addition to the known calibration material dependence of the
   50\% detection efficiencies of 3790 CPCs, we found a dependence on the
   morphology of the particles used for calibration. In our experiments
   more spherical particles shifted the 50\% detection efficiencies towards
   larger mobility diameters.

Abstract = {{Detecting anomalies in datasets, where each data object is a
   multivariate time series, possibly of different length for each data
   object, is emerging as a key problem in certain domains. The problem is
   considered in the context of aviation safety, where data objects are
   flights of various durations and the multivariate time series
   corresponds to sensor readings. The goal is then to detect anomalous
   flight segments, due to mechanical, environmental, or human factors. In
   this paper, a general framework is presented for anomaly detection in
   such settings by representing each multivariate time series using a
   vector autoregressive exogenous model, constructing a distance matrix
   among the objects based on their respective vector autoregressive
   exogenous models, and finally detecting anomalies based on the object
   dissimilarities. The framework is scalable, due to the inherent parallel
   nature of most computations, and can be used to perform online anomaly
   detection. Experimental results on a real flight dataset illustrate that
   the framework can detect different types of multivariate anomalies along
   with the key parameters involved.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{792}},
Pages = {{869-893}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We study the case of inertial particles heated by thermal radiation
   while settling by gravity through a turbulent transparent gas. We
   consider dilute and optically thin regimes in which each particle
   receives the same heat flux. Numerical simulations of forced homogeneous
   turbulence are performed taking into account the two-way coupling of
   both momentum and temperature between the dispersed and continuous
   phases. Particles much smaller than the smallest flow scales are
   considered and the point-particle approximation is adopted. The particle
   Stokes number (based on the Kolmogorov time scale) is of order unity,
   while the nominal settling velocity is up to an order of magnitude
   larger than the Kolmogorov velocity, marking a critical difference with
   previous two-way coupled simulations. It is found that non-heated
   particles enhance turbulence when their settling velocity is
   sufficiently high compared to the Kolmogorov velocity. Energy spectra
   show that the non-heated particle settling impacts both the very small
   and very large flow scales, while the intermediate scales are weakly
   affected. When heated, particles shed plumes of buoyant gas, further
   modifying the turbulence structure. At the considered radiation
   intensities, clustering is strong but the classic mechanism of
   preferential concentration is modified, while preferential sweeping is
   eliminated or even reversed. Particle heating also causes a significant
   reduction of the mean settling velocity, which is caused by rising
   buoyant plumes in the vicinity of particle clusters. The turbulent
   kinetic energy is affected non-monotonically as the radiation intensity
   is increased due to the competing effects of the downward gravitational
   force and the upward buoyancy force. The thermal radiation influences
   all scales of the turbulence. The effects of settling and buoyancy on
   the turbulence anisotropy are also discussed.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{792}},
Pages = {{981-996}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An analytical correlation is developed for stagnation-point heat flux on
   spherical objects travelling at high velocity which is accurate for
   conditions ranging from the continuum to the free-molecular flow regime.
   Theoretical analysis of the Burnett and super-Burnett equations is
   performed using simplifications from shock-wave and boundary-layer
   theory to determine the relative contribution of higher-order heat flux
   terms compared with the Fourier heat flux (assumed in the Navier-Stokes
   equations). A rarefaction parameter (W-r equivalent to M-infinity(2
   omega)/Re-infinity), based on the free-stream Mach number (M-infinity),
   the Reynolds number (Re-infinity) and the viscosity-temperature index
   (omega), is identified as a better correlating parameter than the
   Knudsen number in the transition regime. By studying both the Burnett
   and super-Burnett equations, a general form for the entire series of
   higher-order heat flux contributions is obtained. The resulting heat
   flux expression includes terms with dependence on gas properties,
   stagnation to wall-temperature ratio and a main dependence on powers of
   the rarefaction parameter W-r. The expression is applied as a correction
   to the Fourier heat flux and therefore can be combined with any
   continuum-based correlation of choice. In the free-molecular limit, a
   bridging function is used to ensure consistency with well-established
   free-molecular flow theory. The correlation is then fitted to direct
   simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) solutions for stagnation-point heat flux
   in high-speed nitrogen flows. The correlation is shown to accurately
   capture the variation in heat flux predicted by the DSMC method in the
   transition flow regime, while limiting to both continuum and
   free-molecular values.}},

Abstract = {{The depth ordering of two surfaces, one occluding the other, can in
   principle be determined from the correlation between the occlusion
   border's blur and the blur of the two surfaces. If the border is
   blurred, the blurrier surface is nearer; if the border is sharp, the
   sharper surface is nearer. Previous research has found that observers do
   not use this informative cue. We reexamined this finding. Using a
   multiplane display, we confirmed the previous finding: Our observers did
   not accurately judge depth order when the blur was rendered and the
   stimulus presented on one plane. We then presented the same simulated
   scenes on multiple planes, each at a different focal distance, so the
   blur was created by the optics of the eye. Performance was now much
   better, which shows that depth order can be reliably determined from
   blur information but only when the optical effects are similar to those
   in natural viewing. We asked what the critical differences were in the
   single-and multiplane cases. We found that chromatic aberration provides
   useful information but accommodative microfluctuations do not. In
   addition, we examined how image formation is affected by occlusions and
   observed some interesting phenomena that allow the eye to see around and
   through occluding objects and may allow observers to estimate depth in
   da Vinci stereopsis, where one eye's view is blocked. Finally, we
   evaluated how accurately different rendering and displaying techniques
   reproduce the retinal images that occur in real occlusions. We discuss
   implications for computer graphics.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We use input-output analysis to predict and understand the aeroacoustics
   of high-speed isothermal turbulent jets. We consider axisymmetric linear
   perturbations about Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes solutions of ideally
   expanded turbulent jets with jet Mach numbers 0.6 < M-j < 1.8. For each
   base flow, we compute the optimal harmonic forcing function and the
   corresponding linear response using singular value decomposition of the
   resolvent operator. In addition to the optimal mode, input-output
   analysis also yields sub-optimal modes associated with smaller singular
   values. For supersonic jets, the optimal response closely resembles a
   wavepacket in both the near-field and the far-field such as those
   obtained by the parabolized stability equations (PSE), and this mode
   dominates the response. For subsonic jets, however, the singular values
   indicate that the contributions of sub-optimal modes to noise generation
   are nearly equal to that of the optimal mode, explaining why the PSE do
   not fully capture the far-field sound in this case. Furthermore,
   high-fidelity large eddy simulation (LES) is used to assess the
   prevalence of suboptimal modes in the unsteady data. By projecting LES
   source term data onto input modes and the LES acoustic far-field onto
   output modes, we demonstrate that suboptimal modes of both types are
   physically relevant. Published by AIP Publishing.}},

Abstract = {{5-Azacytidine (5-aza-C) is a ribonucleoside analog that induces the
   lethal mutagenesis of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by
   causing predominantly G-to-C transversions during reverse transcription.
   5-Aza-C could potentially act primarily as a ribonucleotide (5-aza-CTP)
   or as a deoxyribonucleotide (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine triphosphate
   {[}5-aza-dCTP]) during reverse transcription. In order to determine the
   primary form of 5-aza-C that is active against HIV-1, Illumina
   sequencing was performed using proviral DNA from cells treated with
   5-aza-C or 5-aza-dC. 5-Aza-C and 5-aza-dC were found to induce highly
   similar patterns of mutation in HIV-1 in terms of the types of mutations
   observed, the magnitudes of effects, and the distributions of mutations
   at individual sequence positions. Further, 5-aza-dCTP was detected by
   liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in cells treated with
   5-aza-C, demonstrating that 5-aza-C was a substrate for ribonucleotide
   reductase. Notably, levels of 5-aza-dCTP were similar in cells treated
   with equivalent effective concentrations of 5-aza-C or 5-aza-dC. Lastly,
   HIV-1 reverse transcriptase was found to incorporate 5-aza-CTP in vitro
   at least 10,000-fold less efficiently than 5-aza-dCTP. Taken together,
   these data support the model that 5-aza-C enhances the mutagenesis of
   HIV-1 primarily after reduction to 5-aza-dC, which can then be
   incorporated during reverse transcription and lead to G-to-C
   hypermutation. These findings may have important implications for the
   design of new ribonucleoside analogs directed against retroviruses.}},

Volume = {{30}},

Abstract = {{Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a congenital heart defect that has been
   associated with serious aortopathies, such as aortic stenosis, aortic
   regurgitation, infective endocarditis, aortic dissection, calcific
   aortic valve and dilatation of ascending aorta. There are two main
   hypotheses to explain the increase prevalence of aortopathies in
   patients with BAV: the genetic and the hemodynamic. In this study, we
   seek to investigate the possible role of hemodynamic factors as causes
   of BAV-associated aortopathy. We employ the curvilinear immersed
   boundary method coupled with an efficient thin-shell finite-element
   formulation for tissues to carry out fluid-structure interaction
   simulations of a healthy trileaflet aortic valve (TAV) and a BAV placed
   in the same anatomic aorta. The computed results reveal major
   differences between the TAV and BAV flow patterns. These include: the
   dynamics of the aortic valve vortex ring formation and break up; the
   large-scale flow patterns in the ascending aorta; the shear stress
   magnitude, directions, and dynamics on the heart valve surfaces. The
   computed results are in qualitative agreement with in vivo magnetic
   resonance imaging data and suggest that the linkages between BAV
   aortopathy and hemodynamics deserve further investigation.}},

   replacement for petroleum-derived polyols in the synthesis of both
   thermoplastic polyurethanes and flexible foams. These materials rival
   petroleum-derived PUs in performance and can also be easily recycled to
   recover beta-methyl-delta-valerolactone monomer in high purity and high

Abstract = {{Traditional taxi systems in metropolitan areas often suffer from
   inefficiencies due to uncoordinated actions as system capacity and
   customer demand change. With the pervasive deployment of networked
   sensors in modern vehicles, large amounts of information regarding
   customer demand and system status can be collected in real time. This
   information provides opportunities to perform various types of control
   and coordination for large-scale intelligent transportation systems. In
   this paper, we present a receding horizon control (RHC) framework to
   dispatch taxis, which incorporates highly spatiotemporally correlated
   demand/supply models and real-time Global Positioning System (GPS)
   location and occupancy information. The objectives include matching
   spatiotemporal ratio between demand and supply for service quality with
   minimum current and anticipated future taxi idle driving distance.
   Extensive trace-driven analysis with a data set containing taxi
   operational records in San Francisco, CA, USA, shows that our solution
   reduces the average total idle distance by 52\%, and reduces the supply
   demand ratio error across the city during one experimental time slot by
   45\%. Moreover, our RHC framework is compatible with a wide variety of
   predictive models and optimization problem formulations. This
   compatibility property allows us to solve robust optimization problems
   with corresponding demand uncertainty models that provide disruptive
   event information.
   Note to Practitioners-With the development of mobile sensor and data
   processing technology, the competition between traditional ``hailed on
   street{''} taxi service and ``on demand{''} taxi service has emerged in
   the U.S. and elsewhere. In addition, large amounts of data sets for taxi
   operational records provide potential demand information that is
   valuable for better taxi dispatch systems. Existing taxi dispatch
   approaches are usually greedy algorithms focus on reducing customer
   waiting time instead of total idle driving distance of taxis. Our
   research is motivated by the increasing need for more efficient,
   real-time taxi dispatch methods that utilize both historical records and
   real-time sensing information to match the dynamic customer demand. This
   paper suggests a new receding horizon control (RHC) framework aiming to
   utilize the predicted demand information when making taxi dispatch
   decisions, so that passengers at different areas of a city are fairly
   served and the total idle distance of vacant taxis are reduced. We
   formulate a multi-objective optimization problem based on the dispatch
   requirements and practical constraints. The dispatch center updates GPS
   and occupancy status information of each taxi periodically and solves
   the computationally tractable optimization problem at each iteration
   step of the RHC framework. Experiments for a data set of taxi
   operational records in San Francisco show that the RHC framework in our
   work can redistribute taxi supply across the whole city while reducing
   total idle driving distance of vacant taxis. In future research, we plan
   to design control algorithms for various types of demand model and
   experiment on data sets with a larger scale.}},

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis, transport measurements, and electronic
   structure of conjugation-broken oligophenyleneimine (CB-OPI 6) molecular
   wires with lengths of similar to 4 nm. The wires were grown from Au
   surfaces using stepwise aryl imine condensation reactions between
   1,4-diaminobenzene and terephthalaldehyde (1,4-benzene-dicarbaldehyde).
   Saturated spacers (conjugation breakers) were introduced into the
   molecular backbone by replacing the aromatic diamine with
   trans-1,4-diaminocyclohexane at specific steps during the growth
   processes. FT-IR and ellipsometry were used to follow the imination
   reactions on Au surfaces. Surface coverages (similar to 4
   molecules/nm(2)) and electronic structures of the wires were determined
   by cyclic voltammetry and UV-vis spectroscopy, respectively. The
   current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the wires were acquired using
   conducting probe atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) in which an Au-coated
   AFM probe was brought into contact with the wires to form
   metal-molecule-metal junctions with contact areas of similar to 50
   nm(2). The low bias resistance increased with the number of saturated
   spacers, but was not sensitive to the position of the spacer within the
   wire. Temperature dependent measurements of resistance were consistent
   with a localized charge (polaron) hopping mechanism in all of the wires.
   Activation energies were in the range of 0.18-0.26 eV (4.2-6.0 kcal/mol)
   with the highest belonging to the fully conjugated OPI 6 wire and the
   lowest to the CB3,5-OPI 6-wire (the wire with two saturated spacers).
   For the two other wires with a single conjugation breaker, CB3-OPI 6 and
   CBS-OPI 6, activation energies of 0.20 eV (4.6 kcal/mol) and 0.21 eV
   (4.8 kcal/mol) were found, respectively. Computational studies using
   density functional theory confirmed the polaronic nature of charge
   carriers but predicted that the semiclassical activation energy of
   hopping should be higher for CB-OPI molecular wires than for the OPI 6
   wire. To reconcile the experimental and computational results, we
   propose that the transport mechanism is thermally assisted polaron
   tunneling in the case of CB-OPI wires, which is consistent with their
   increased resistance.}},

Abstract = {{Lignocellulosic ethanol has potential for lower life cycle greenhouse
   gas emissions compared to gasoline and conventional grain-based ethanol.
   Ethanol production `pathways' need to meet economic and environmental
   goals. Numerous life cycle assessments of lignocellulosic ethanol have
   been published over the last 15 years, but gaps remain in understanding
   life cycle performance due to insufficient data, and model and
   methodological issues. We highlight key aspects of these issues, drawing
   on literature and a case study of corn stover ethanol. Challenges
   include the complexity of feedstock/ecosystems and market-mediated
   aspects and the short history of commercial lignocellulosic ethanol
   facilities, which collectively have led to uncertainty in GHG emissions
   estimates, and to debates on LCA methods and the role of uncertainty in
   decision making.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the clutch control problem for automotive
   transmission systems. This paper focuses on the pressure tracking
   control for a wet clutch, which has a much shorter stroke and asks for a
   more precise position and pressure regulation. The system dynamics are
   highly nonlinear, and the developed model includes unmodeled dynamics
   and parameter uncertainties. All these factors will influence the
   closed-loop system performance if not considered carefully during the
   control design, which makes the control synthesis for clutch systems
   challenging. Compared with the existing sliding-mode control (SMC)
   method, an improved method based on nonlinear sliding mode is presented
   in this paper to further improve the convergence rate and tracking
   precision of the closed-loop clutch system. This controller ensures that
   the pressure tracking error not only reaches the sliding manifold in
   finite time but converges to the equilibrium point in finite time as
   well. Moreover, considering the chattering phenomenon caused by high
   switching gains, a composite terminal SMC (TSMC) method based on
   uncertainty observer is proposed to reduce chattering. Using an extended
   state observer (ESO) technique, an uncertainty observer is designed for
   estimating the model uncertainties of pressure dynamics,
   pressure-reducing-valve flow dynamics, and estimation error of piston
   displacement. Then, a feedforward compensation term is combined with the
   terminal-sliding-mode feedback control. Thus, the composite
   terminal-sliding-mode controller may take smaller control gains for the
   whole pressure tracking procedure without sacrificing uncertainty
   compensation performance. Experimental results based on an xPC Target
   platform of the clutch system are provided to show the superiority of
   the proposed methods.}},

Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{273-281}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{In the field of biomedical engineering, identification of source signals
   between multichannel signals is an important technique for measuring the
   functional connectivity of a variety of brain states and pathological
   cases such as seizures. It is likely to occur in a weak coupling
   condition, where the neural actions interact with each other on the
   level of phase, whereas their amplitudes remain practically uncoupled.
   Hence, source signal identification by analyzing the directional
   interactions from a phase-coupled complex neural network is of interest.
   This study proposes a technique for identifying active source signals by
   estimating the directional effects of phase coupling in multivariate
   neural systems. In the proposed method, the directional index of the
   phase coupling is developed from the framework of phase noise situation
   and the Kuramoto model. The proposed method is evaluated and compared
   with the well-known adaptive directed transfer function (ADTF) method
   via simulations of various chaotic oscillatory processes and interictal
   spikes data obtained from an epileptic patient. The results indicate
   that the proposed source identification technique outperforms the
   conventional ADTF method under the weak coupling condition and that it
   can discriminate between direct and indirect connectivity.}},

Abstract = {{The high thermal conductivity of graphene and few-layer graphene
   undergoes severe degradations through contact with the substrate. Here
   we show experimentally that the thermal management of a micro heater is
   substantially improved by introducing alternative heat-escaping channels
   into a graphene-based film bonded to functionalized graphene oxide
   through amino-silane molecules. Using a resistance temperature probe for
   in situ monitoring we demonstrate that the hotspot temperature was
   lowered by similar to 28 degrees C for a chip operating at 1,300
   Wcm(-2). Thermal resistance probed by pulsed photothermal reflectance
   measurements demonstrated an improved thermal coupling due to
   functionalization on the graphene-graphene oxide interface. Three
   functionalization molecules manifest distinct interfacial thermal
   transport behaviour, corroborating our atomistic calculations in
   unveiling the role of molecular chain length and functional groups.
   Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the functionalization
   constrains the cross-plane phonon scattering, which in turn enhances
   in-plane heat conduction of the bonded graphene film by recovering the
   long flexural phonon lifetime.}},

Title = {{Material fields in atomistics as pull-backs of spatial distributions}},

Abstract = {{The various fields defined in continuum mechanics have both a material
   and a spatial description that are related through the deformation
   mapping. In contrast, continuum fields defined for atomistic systems
   using the Irving-Kirkwood or Murdoch-Hardy procedures correspond to a
   spatial description. It is uncommon to define atomistic fields in the
   reference configuration due to the lack of a unique definition for the
   deformation mapping in atomistic systems. In this paper, we construct
   referential atomistic distributions as pull-backs of the spatial
   distributions obtained in the Murdoch-Hardy procedure with respect to a
   postulated deformation mapping that tracks particles. We then show that
   some of these referential distributions are independent of the choice of
   the deformation mapping and only depend on the reference and current
   configuration of particles. Therefore, the fields obtained from these
   distributions can be calculated without explicitly constructing a
   deformation map, and by construction they satisfy the balance equations.
   In particular, we obtain definitions for the first and second atomistic
   Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensors. We demonstrate the validity of these
   definitions through a numerical example involving finite deformation of
   a slab containing a notch under tension. An interesting feature of the
   atomistic first Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is the absence of a
   kinetic part, which in the atomistic Cauchy stress tensor accounts for
   thermal fluctuations. We show that this effect is implicitly included in
   the atomistic first PiolaKirchhoff stress tensor through the motion of
   the particles. An open source program to compute the atomistic Cauchy
   and first Piola-Kirchhoff stress fields called MDStressLab is available
   online at http://mdstresslab.org. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Pages = {{288-294}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The study evaluated the effect of 4 weeks of combined resistance-balance
   training and resistance training alone in a 90 degrees tilted
   environment on muscle power. Two groups of healthy young subjects
   performed leg extensions while in a supine position, either on a firm
   surface along a linear track or on an unstable surface requiring
   mediolateral balancing movements. Power and force during squats were
   measured at isokinetic velocities of 10 and 35deg/s. Results showed
   significantly greater gains in peak force (44.1\%; F-1,F-21=8.876,
   p=0.026), mean force (58.6\%; F-1,F-21=16.136, p=0.013), peak power
   (58.7\%; F-1,F-21=18.754, p=0.009), and mean power (59.2\%;
   F-1,F-21=23.114, p=0.007) at the velocity of 35deg/s after stable than
   unstable resistance training. However, there were no significant
   between-groups differences in pre-post training gains in peak force
   (10.4\%; F-1,F-21=1.965, p=0.74), mean force (10.3\%; F-1,F-21=1.889,
   p=0.80), peak power (12.9\%; F-1,F-21=2.980, p=0.49), and mean power
   (19.1\%; F-1,F-21=3.454, p=0.36) during squats at the velocity of
   10deg/s. Resistance exercises under stable conditions performed in a 90
   degrees tilted environment are more effective in the improvement of high
   velocity muscle power than their use in combination with balance
   exercises. Such training may be applicable in pre- and in-flight
   exercise regimens for astronauts and in functional rehabilitation of
   bed-ridden patients.}},

Abstract = {{Surface-adsorbed polar molecules can significantly alter the
   ferroelectric properties of oxide thin films. Thus, fundamental
   understanding and controlling the effect of surface adsorbates are
   crucial for the implementation of ferroelectric thin film devices, such
   as ferroelectric tunnel junctions. Herein, we report an imprint control
   of BaTiO3 (BTO) thin films by chemically induced surface polarization
   pinning in the top few atomic layers of the water-exposed BTO films. Our
   studies based on synchrotron X-ray scattering and coherent Bragg rod
   analysis demonstrate that the chemically induced surface polarization is
   not switchable but reduces the polarization imprint and improves the
   bistability of ferroelectric phase in BTO tunnel junctions. We conclude
   that the chemical treatment of ferroelectric thin films with polar
   molecules may serve as a simple yet powerful strategy to enhance
   functional properties of ferroelectric tunnel junctions for their
   practical applications.}},

   outlined the potential public health impact of organ banking, discussed
   the major remaining scientific challenges that need to be overcome in
   order to bank organs, and identified key opportunities to accelerate
   progress toward this goal. Many areas of public health could be
   revolutionized by the banking of organs and other complex tissues,
   including transplantation, oncofertility, tissue engineering, trauma
   medicine and emergency preparedness, basic biomedical research and drug
   discovery - and even space travel. Key remaining scientific
   sub-challenges were discussed including ice nucleation and growth,
   cryoprotectant and osmotic toxicities, chilling injury,
   thermo-mechanical stress, the need for rapid and uniform rewarming, and
   ischemia/reperfusion injury. A variety of opportunities to overcome
   these challenge areas were discussed, i.e. preconditioning for enhanced
   stress tolerance, nanoparticle rewarming, cyroprotectant screening
   strategies, and the use of cryoprotectant cocktails including ice
   binding agents.}},

Abstract = {{Fungi typically live in highly diverse communities composed of multiple
   ecological guilds. Although high-throughput sequencing has greatly
   increased the ability to quantify the diversity of fungi in
   environmental samples, researchers currently lack a simple and
   consistent way to sort large sequence pools into ecologically meaningful
   categories. We address this issue by introducing FUNGuild, a tool that
   can be used to taxonomically parse fungal OTUs by ecological guild
   independent of sequencing platform or analysis pipeline. Using a
   database and an accompanying bioinformatics script, we demonstrate the
   application of FUNGuild to three high-throughput sequencing datasets
   from different habitats: forest soils, grassland soils, and decomposing
   wood. We found that guilds characteristic of each habitat (i.e.,
   saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi in forest soils, saprotrophic and
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in grassland soils, saprotrophic, wood
   decomposer, and plant pathogenic fungi in decomposing wood) were each
   well represented. The example datasets demonstrate that while we could
   quickly and efficiently assign a large portion of the data to guilds,
   another large portion could not be assigned, reflecting the need to
   expand and improve the database as well as to gain a better
   understanding of natural history for many described and undescribed
   fungal species. As a community resource, FUNGuild is dependent on
   third-party annotation, so we invite researchers to populate it with new
   categories and records as well as refine those already in existence. (C)

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are widely used as contrast and therapeutic agents. As
   such, imaging modalities that can accurately estimate their distribution
   in-vivo are actively sought. We present here our method Magneto Acoustic
   Tomography (MAT), which uses magnetomotive force due to a short pulsed
   magnetic field to induce ultrasound in the magnetic nanoparticle labeled
   tissue and estimates an image of the distribution of the nanoparticles
   in-vivo with ultrasound imaging resolution. In this study, we image the
   distribution of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (IONP) using
   MAT method. In-vivo imaging was performed on live, nude mice with IONP
   injected into LNCaP tumors grown subcutaneously within the hind limb of
   the mice. Our experimental results indicate that the MAT method is
   capable of imaging the distribution of IONPs in-vivo. Therefore, MAT
   could become an imaging modality for high resolution reconstruction of
   MNP distribution in the body.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Precise manipulation and control of coherent lattice oscillations via
   nanostructuring and phonon-wave interference has the potential to
   significantly impact a broad array of technologies and research areas.
   Resolving the dynamics of individual phonons in defect-laden materials
   presents an enormous challenge, however, owing to the interdependent
   nanoscale and ultrafast spatiotemporal scales. Here we report direct,
   real-space imaging of the emergence and evolution of acoustic phonons at
   individual defects in crystalline WSe2 and Ge. Via bright-field imaging
   with an ultrafast electron microscope, we are able to image the
   sub-picosecond nucleation and the launch of wavefronts at step edges and
   resolve dispersion behaviours during propagation and scattering. We
   discover that the appearance of speed-of-sound (for example, 6 nm
   ps(-1)) wavefronts are influenced by spatially varying nanoscale strain
   fields, taking on the appearance of static bend contours during
   propagation. These observations provide unprecedented insight into the
   roles played by individual atomic and nanoscale features on
   acoustic-phonon dynamics.}},

Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this paper is to review the current literature
   regarding the use of vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) in preclinical models
   of traumatic brain injury (TBI) as well as discuss the potential role of
   VNS along with alternative neuromodulation approaches in the treatment
   of human TBI. Data from previous studies have demonstrated VNS-mediated
   improvement following TBI in animal models. In these cases, VNS was
   observed to enhance motor and cognitive recovery, attenuate cerebral
   edema and inflammation, reduce blood brain barrier breakdown, and confer
   neuroprotective effects. Yet, the underlying mechanisms by which VNS
   enhances recovery following TBI remain to be fully elucidated. Several
   hypotheses have been offered including: a noradrenergic mechanism,
   reduction in post-TBI seizures and hyper-excitability, anti-inflammatory
   effects, attenuation of blood-brain barrier breakdown, and cerebral
   edema. We present other potential mechanisms by which VNS acts including
   enhancement of synaptic plasticity and recruitment of endogenous neural
   stem cells, stabilization of intracranial pressure, and interaction with
   the ghrelin system. In addition, alternative methods for the treatment
   of TBI including deep brain stimulation, transcranial magnetic
   stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation, and focused
   ultrasound stimulation are discussed. Although the primary source data
   show that VNS improves TBI outcomes, it remains to be determined if
   these findings can be translated to clinical settings.}},

Title = {{Implications of Cofeeding Acetaldehyde on Ethene Selectivity in

   Interpretation}},
Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Cofeeding acetaldehyde (14 C\%) with dimethyl ether (DME) and methanol
   (DME:methanol similar to 9:1, on a carbon basis) on two MFI-type
   zeolites: a conventional (Conv) MFI zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 similar to 80,
   diffusion length similar to 250 nm) and a self-pillared pentasil (SPP)
   MFI zeolite (SiO2/Al2O3 similar to 150, diffusion length similar to 1.5
   nm) at 673 K resulted in a monotonic increase in selectivity toward
   ethene (from 9.3 to 15 C\% on Conv MFI and from 1.4 to 6.4 C\% on SPP
   MFI) and methylbenzenes (from 4.9 to 7.8 C\% on Conv MFI and 2.6 to 5.3
   C\% on SPP MFI). The mechanistic basis for this increase in ethene and
   methylbenzene (MB) selectivity is acetaldehyde undergoing multiple
   aldol-condensation reactions to form higher homologues (e.g.,
   sorbaldehyde) that subsequently undergo ring-closure followed by
   dehydration to form aromatics (e.g., benzene). Cofeeding acetaldehyde,
   therefore, increases the concentration of aromatics inside the zeolite
   pores, which in turn enhances the propagation of the aromatics-based
   methylation/dealkylation cycle and consequentially results in higher
   ethene production. In an isotopic experiment where C-13(2)-acetaldehyde
   (similar to 4 C\%) was coreacted with unlabeled DME and methanol
   (DME:methanol similar to 9:1, on carbon basis) on Conv MFI and SPP MFI
   at 673 K, ethene present in the effluent was enriched with two C-13
   labels and the net C-13-content in ethene (1112\% on Conv MFI and 4552\%
   on SPP MFI) was higher than the C-13-content in MBs (56\% on Conv MFI
   and 917\% on SPP MFI). Ethene, therefore, besides being formed via
   aromatic-dealkylation, is also being produced from acetaldehyde or its
   aldol-condensation products via a direct synthesis route.}},

Title = {{MRI Reconstructions of Human Phrenic Nerve Anatomy and Computational
   Modeling of Cryoballoon Ablative Therapy}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{44}},

Abstract = {{The primary goal of this computational modeling study was to better
   quantify the relative distance of the phrenic nerves to areas where
   cryoballoon ablations may be applied within the left atria. Phrenic
   nerve injury can be a significant complication of applied ablative
   therapies for treatment of drug refractory atrial fibrillation. To date,
   published reports suggest that such injuries may occur more frequently
   in cryoballoon ablations than in radiofrequency therapies. Ten human
   heart-lung blocs were prepared in an end-diastolic state, scanned with
   MRI, and analyzed using Mimics software as a means to make anatomical
   measurements. Next, generated computer models of ArticFront cryoballoons
   (23, 28 mm) were mated with reconstructed pulmonary vein ostias to
   determine relative distances between the phrenic nerves and projected
   balloon placements, simulating pulmonary vein isolation. The effects of
   deep seating balloons were also investigated. Interestingly, the
   relative anatomical differences in placement of 23 and 28 mm
   cryoballoons were quite small, e.g., the determined difference between
   mid spline distance to the phrenic nerves between the two cryoballoon
   sizes was only 1.7 +/- A 1.2 mm. Furthermore, the right phrenic nerves
   were commonly closer to the pulmonary veins than the left, and
   surprisingly tips of balloons were further from the nerves, yet balloon
   size choice did not significantly alter calculated distance to the
   nerves. Such computational modeling is considered as a useful tool for
   both clinicians and device designers to better understand these
   associated anatomies that, in turn, may lead to optimization of
   therapeutic treatments.}},

Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{684-700}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We present a multiperiod model of a retail supply chain, consisting of a
   single supplier and a single retailer, in which regular replenishment
   occurs periodically but players have the option to support fast delivery
   when customers experience a stockout during a replenishment period.
   Because expedited shipments increase the supplier's transportation cost,
   and possibly production/inventory costs, the supplier typically charges
   a markup over and above the prevailing wholesale price for fast-shipped
   items. When fast shipping is not supported, items are backordered if
   customers are willing to wait until the start of the next replenishment
   period. We characterize the retailers and the supplier's optimal
   stocking and production policies and then utilize our analytical
   framework to study how the two players respond to changes in supply
   chain parameters. We identify a sufficient condition such that the
   centralized supply chain is better off with the fast-ship option. We
   find a range of markups for fast-ship orders such that the fast-ship
   option is preferred by both the supplier and the retailer in a
   decentralized chain. However, a markup that is a win-win for both
   players may not exist even when offering fast-ship option is better for
   the centralized chain. Our analysis also shows that depending on how the
   markup is determined, greater customer participation in fast-ship orders
   does not necessarily imply more profits for the two players. For some
   predetermined markups, the retailer's profit with the fast-ship option
   is higher when more customers are willing to wait. However, the retailer
   may not be able to benefit from the fast-ship option because the
   supplier may choose not to support the fast-ship option when fast-ship
   participation increases due to the fact that the fast-ship participation
   rate adversely affects the initial order size.}},

Abstract = {{The availability of high-resolution digital elevation data (submeter
   resolution) from LiDAR has increased dramatically over the past few
   years. As a result, the efficient storage and transmission of those
   large data sets and their use for geomorphic feature extraction and
   hydrologic/environmental modeling are becoming a scientific challenge.
   This letter explores the use of multiresolution wavelet analysis for
   compression of LiDAR digital elevation data sets. The compression takes
   advantage of the fact that, in most landscapes, neighboring pixels are
   correlated and thus contain some redundant information. The
   space-frequency localization of the wavelet filters allows one to
   preserve detailed high-resolution features where needed while
   representing the rest of the landscape at lower resolution. We explore a
   lossy compression methodology based on biorthogonal wavelets and
   demonstrate that, by keeping only approximately 10\% of the original
   information (data compression ratio similar to 94\%), the reconstructed
   landscapes retain most of the information of relevance to geomorphologic
   applications, such as the ability to accurately extract channel networks
   for environmental flux routing, as well as to identify geomorphic
   process transition from the curvature-slope and slope-distance
   relationships.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Standardized assessment of laparoscopic skill in urology is
   lacking. We investigated whether the AUA (American Urological
   Association) BLUS (Basic Laparoscopic Urologic Skills) skill tasks are
   valid to address this need.
   Materials and Methods: This institutional review board approved study
   included 27 medical students, 42 urology residents, 18 fellows and 37
   faculty urologists across 8 sites. Using the EDGE (Electronic Data
   Generation and Evaluation) device (Simulab, Seattle, Washington) 454
   recordings were collected on peg transfer, pattern cutting, suturing and
   clip applying tasks, which together comprise the expert determined BLUS
   tasks. We collected synchronized video and tool motion data for each
   trial. For each task errors, time, path length, economy of motion, peak
   grasp force and EDGE score were collected. An expert panel of 5 faculty
   members performed GOALS (Global Objective Assessment of Laparoscopic
   Skills) evaluations on a representative subset of peg transfer and
   suturing skill tasks performed by 24 participants (IRR = 0.95).
   Results: Demographically derived skill levels proved unsuitable to
   evaluate construct validity. Separation of mean scores by grouped skill
   levels was strongest for the suturing task. Objective motion metrics and
   errors supported construct validity vis-a-vis correlation with blinded
   expert video ratings (motion metrics R-2 = 0.95, p < 0.01). Expert
   scores appeared to reward errors in suturing but not in block transfer.
   Conclusions: BLUS skill task performance scoring can discriminate among
   basic laparoscopic technical skill levels. Self-reported demographics
   are an unreliable source of determining laparoscopic technical skill.}},

Abstract = {{The emergence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms poses an alarming
   threat to global health. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered a
   possible effective alternative to conventional antibiotic therapies. An
   understanding of the mechanism of action of AMPs is needed in order to
   better control and optimize their bactericidal activity. Plantaricin EF
   is a heterodimeric AMP, consisting of two peptides Plantaricin E (PInE)
   and Plantaricin F (PlnF). We studied the behavior of these peptides on
   the surface of a model lipid bilayer. We identified the residues that
   facilitate peptide-peptide interactions. We also identified residues
   that mediate interactions of the dimer with the membrane. PInE interacts
   with the membrane through amino acids at both its termini, while only
   the N terminus of PlnF approaches the membrane. By comparing the
   activity of single-site mutants of the two-peptide bacteriocin and the
   simulations of the bacteriocin on the surface of a model lipid bilayer,
   structure activity relationships are proposed. These studies allow us to
   generate hypotheses that relate biophysical interactions observed in
   simulations with the experimentally measured activity. We find that
   single-site amino acid substitutions result in markedly stronger
   antimicrobial activity when they strengthen the interactions between the
   two peptides, while, concomitantly, they weaken peptide-membrane
   association. This effect is more pronounced in the case of the PlnE
   mutant (G20A), which interacts the strongest with PlnF and the weakest
   with the membrane while displaying the highest activity. (C) 2016

   and D-galacturonate. We designed a growth-based selection platform to
   identify several gene clusters functional in Escherichia coli that can
   perform this nonphosphorylative assimilation of sugars into the TCA
   cycle in less than six steps. To demonstrate the application of this new
   metabolic platform, we built artificial biosynthetic pathways to
   1,4-butanediol (BDO) with a theoretical molar yield of 100\%. By
   screening and engineering downstream pathway enzymes, 2-ketoacid
   decarboxylases and alcohol dehydrogenases, we constructed E. coli
   strains capable of producing BDO from D-xylose, L-arabinose and

Abstract = {{The structural behavior of colonnade structural systems subjected to
   static and dynamic loading is investigated to identify the main factors
   affecting the stability and to improve our understanding of their
   behaviour. In particular, the discrete element method of analysis is
   utilised to study the static and dynamic behaviour of a typical section
   of the two storey colonnade of the Forum in Pompeii. Static analysis
   indicated that the failure of colonnade structures occur at higher
   friction angles as the weight above the structure decreases and so a
   sudden collapse can occur when parts of the monument are disassembled.
   For the dynamic analysis, the mechanical behavior of the colonnade was
   investigated for both harmonic and real seismic excitations. For
   excitations with relatively low dominant frequencies, the primary
   response is rocking; as the excitation frequency increases, the response
   becomes more complicated demonstrating both sliding and rocking
   movements. It was also shown that the construction methods used in
   ancient times, such as multi-block segmented trabeations and solid block
   beam, have quite significant impact on the mechanical response of the
   structures under static and dynamic loading.}},

   and Without Embedding Matrices}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Fiber networks are assemblies of one-dimensional elements representative
   of materials with fibrous microstructures such as collagen networks and
   synthetic nonwovens. The mechanics of random fiber networks has been the
   focus of numerous studies. However, fiber crimp has been explicitly
   represented only in few cases. In the present work, the mechanics of
   cross-linked networks with crimped athermal fibers, with and without an
   embedding elastic matrix, is studied. The dependence of the effective
   network stiffness on the fraction of nonstraight fibers and the relative
   crimp amplitude (or tortuosity) is studied using finite element
   simulations of networks with sinusoidally curved fibers. A semi-analytic
   model is developed to predict the dependence of network modulus on the
   crimp amplitude and the bounds of the stiffness reduction associated
   with the presence of crimp. The transition from the linear to the
   nonlinear elastic response of the network is rendered more gradual by
   the presence of crimp, and the effect of crimp on the network tangent
   stiffness decreases as strain increases. If the network is embedded in
   an elastic matrix, the effect of crimp becomes negligible even for very
   small, biologically relevant matrix stiffness values. However, the
   distribution of the maximum principal stress in the matrix becomes
   broader in the presence of crimp relative to the similar system with

Abstract = {{Microcystis aeruginosa is a single-celled cyanobacterium, forming large
   colonies on the surface of freshwater ecosystems during summer, and
   producing a toxin (microcystin) that in high concentration can be
   harmful to humans and animals. These toxic effects can be governed by
   abiotic environmental conditions including water temperature, light,
   nutrient abundance, and fluid motion. We investigated the effect of
   small-scale turbulence on the growth and metabolism of Microcystis
   aeruginosa using field measurements and laboratory bioreactor
   investigations. The laboratory setup included two underwater speakers,
   generating a quasi-homogeneous turbulent flow with turbulent kinetic
   energy dissipation rates up to 10(-6) m(2)/s(3), comparable to field
   values in the lacustrine photic zone. The role of turbulence is
   quantified by comparing cell number, dissolved oxygen production/uptake,
   and inorganic carbon uptake in stagnant condition and two sets of
   experiments with turbulent conditions, quantified by the Taylor
   micro-scale Reynolds number at Re-lambda = 15 and Re-lambda = 33. The
   results suggest that turbulence mediates the metabolism of Microcystis
   aeruginosa measured by the net oxygen production, oxygen uptake, and
   inorganic carbon uptake. Furthermore, small-scale turbulence marginally
   influenced Microcystis growth rate estimated from cell population
   concentration (-5\% and 11\% for Re-lambda = 33 and Re-lambda = 15,
   respectively, as compared to stagnant conditions).}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{2, SI}},
Pages = {{241-261}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We consider optimal decision-making problems in an uncertain
   environment. In particular, we consider the case in which the
   distribution of the input is unknown, yet there is some historical data
   drawn from the distribution. In this paper, we propose a new type of
   distributionally robust optimization model called the likelihood robust
   optimization (LRO) model for this class of problems. In contrast to
   previous work on distributionally robust optimization that focuses on
   certain parameters (e.g., mean, variance, etc.) of the input
   distribution, we exploit the historical data and define the accessible
   distribution set to contain only those distributions that make the
   observed data achieve a certain level of likelihood. Then we formulate
   the targeting problem as one of optimizing the expected value of the
   objective function under the worst-case distribution in that set. Our
   model avoids the over-conservativeness of some prior robust approaches
   by ruling out unrealistic distributions while maintaining robustness of
   the solution for any statistically likely outcomes. We present
   statistical analyses of our model using Bayesian statistics and
   empirical likelihood theory. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic
   behavior of our distribution set and establish the relationship between
   our model and other distributionally robust models. To test the
   performance of our model, we apply it to the newsvendor problem and the
   portfolio selection problem. The test results show that the solutions of
   our model indeed have desirable performance.}},

Title = {{Identifying K Primary Corridors from urban bicycle GPS trajectories on a
   road network}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{142-159}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Given a set of GPS tracks on a road network and a number k, the
   K-Primary-Corridor (KPC) problem aims to identify k tracks as primary
   corridors such that the overall distance from all tracks to their
   closest primary corridors is minimized. The KPC problem is important to
   domains such as transportation services interested in finding primary
   corridors for public transportation or greener travel (e.g., bicycling)
   by leveraging emerging GPS trajectory datasets. However, the problem is
   challenging due to the large amount of shortest path distance
   computations across tracks. Related trajectory mining approaches, e.g.,
   density or frequency based hot-routes, focus on anomaly detection rather
   than identifying representative corridors minimizing total distances
   from other tracks, and thus may not be effective for the KPC problem.
   Our recent work proposed a k-Primary Corridor algorithm that precomputes
   a column-wise lookup table of network Hausdorff distances. This paper
   extends our recent work with a new computational algorithm based on
   lower bound filtering. We design lower bounds of network Hausdorff
   distances based on the concept of track envelopes and propose three
   different track envelope formation strategies based on random selection,
   overlap, and Jaccard coefficient respectively. Theoretical analysis on
   proof of correctness as well as computational cost models are provided.
   Extensive experiments and case studies show that our new algorithm with
   lower bound filtering significantly reduces the computational time of
   our previous algorithm, and can help effectively determine primary
   bicycle corridors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastomas are the most aggressive primary brain tumor. Despite
   treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, these tumors remain
   uncurable and few significant increases in survival have been observed
   over the last half-century. We recently employed a combined theoretical
   and experimental approach to predict the effectiveness of radiation
   administration schedules, identifying two schedules that led to superior
   survival in a mouse model of the disease (Leder et al., Cell
   156(3):603-616, 2014). Here we extended this approach to consider
   fractionated schedules to best minimize toxicity arising in early- and
   late-responding tissues. To this end, we decomposed the problem into two
   separate solvable optimization tasks: (i) optimization of the amount of
   radiation per dose, and (ii) optimization of the amount of time that
   passes between radiation doses. To ensure clinical applicability, we
   then considered the impact of clinical operating hours by incorporating
   time constraints consistent with operational schedules of the radiology
   clinic. We found that there was no significant loss incurred by
   restricting dosage to an 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. window. Our flexible
   approach is also applicable to other tumor types treated with
   radiotherapy.}},

Title = {{Effect of fan-generated swirl on turbulent heat transfer and fluid flow
   in a pipe}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{1019-1025}},

Abstract = {{Fan-generated swirl can be characterized as chaotic and strongly mixed.
   It differs from controlled swirl with respect to those characteristics
   that tend to increase both the rate of heat transfer and the pressure
   drop. In the investigation described here, a rotating fan simulation,
   which takes full account of the rotation of the fan blades and of the
   true nature of the delivered flow, was implemented with high fidelity.
   The fan output is delivered directly to the inlet of a round pipe. It is
   believed that this is the first time that such a realistic approach has
   been used. The air delivered to the pipe has a temperature different
   from that of the pipe wall. The swirl component is shown to give rise to
   a significant enhancement of heat transfer, from a factor of two to 50\%
   between x/D = 0 and 20. Similar increases of the wall shear were also
   found to result from the swirl. As a comparison case, a blower curve for
   the fan in question was used. Since blower curves omit the swirl
   component, only a uniform axial flow can be extracted. The swirl effects
   on heat transfer and shear stress were obtained by comparing the results
   for the actual rotating-fan-provided flow with those for the blower
   curve model. In the absence of swirl, the axial distributions of the
   local heat transfer coefficient and wall shear displayed a local
   undershoot, thereby supporting limited earlier reporting of such
   happenings in simpler situations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and electrical characterization of
   photoswitchable pi-conjugated molecular wires. The wires were designed
   based on the previously reported oligophenyleneimine (OPI) wires
   {[}Frisbie et al. Science 2008, 320, 1482] with a slight modification to
   incorporate the dithienylethene linker (the ``photoswitch{''}) into the
   wire backbone (e.g., PS3-OPI 5; PS stands for the photoswitch, and the
   number following ``PS{''} indicates its position within the OPI chain).
   Stepwise arylimine condensation reaction between 1,4-diaminobenzene and
   terephthalaldehyde (1,4-benzenedicarbaldehyde) was employed to grow
   these wires from Au surfaces. To insert the ``photoswitch{''} into the
   wire, 1,4-diaminobenzene was replaced with
   perfluoro-1,2-bis(2-(4-aminopheny1)-5-methylthien-4-yl)cydopentene (PS)
   at specific steps during the wire growth. A variety of surface
   characterization techniques were employed to investigate the structure
   of the wires including FT-IR spectroscopy, ellipsometry, cyclic
   voltammetry (CV), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and UV-vis
   spectroscopy. The current voltage (I-V) characteristics and resistances
   of the wires were acquired using conducting probe atomic force
   microscopy (CP-AFM). It was observed that all of the wires switch
   between high and low conductance modes ({''}ON{''} and ``OFF{''} states
   corresponding to ``closed{''} and ``open{''} forms of the
   dithienylethene linker, respectively) when irradiated by UV and visible
   light, respectively. Measuring the temperature dependence of the
   resistance revealed that the charge transport mechanism in the PS3-OPI 3
   wire is tunneling (temperature independent) whereas longer PS3-OPI 5 and
   PSS-OPI 5 showed Arrhenius temperature dependence which is
   characteristic of a hopping mechanism. These experiments demonstrate
   light-based control of transport in molecular wires in the hopping
   regime, which ultimately may be useful for switching applications in
   molecular electronics.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},

Abstract = {{The spin waves and ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) contribution to the
   spin pumping signal is studied in the Ta/CoFeB interface under different
   excitation bias fields. Ferromagnetic resonance is excited utilizing a
   coplanar waveguide and a microwave generator. Using a narrow waveguide
   of 3 mu m, magnetostatic surface spin waves with a large wavevector (k)
   of about 0.81 mu m(-1) are excited. A large k value results in the
   dissociation of spin waves and FMR frequencies according to the surface
   spin wave dispersion relation. Spin waves and FMR contribution to the
   spin pumping are calculated based on the area under the Lorentzian curve
   fitting over experimental results. It is found that the FMR over spin
   wave contribution is about 1 at large bias fields in a Ta/CoFeB
   structure. Based on our spin pumping results, we propose a method to
   characterize the spin wave decay constant, which is found to be about
   5.5 +/- 1.27 mu m in the Ta/CoFeB structure at a bias field of 600 Oe.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a model-based dynamic optimization study of the
   operation of an outdoor open pond for microalgae cultivation. A
   nonlinear mathematical model based on first-principles for predicting
   the growth of microalgae in open ponds is developed and validated
   against literature data. To account for the impact of weather vagaries
   on the cultivation of microalgae, data for local climatic conditions is
   incorporated into the model. The supply of dissolved CO, to the algal
   culture from a CO, rich gas is modeled as well. Optimal monthly
   operating profiles for the dilution rate, CO, gas flow rate, and makeup
   water flow rate are determined based on minimization of the cultivation
   cost. The case study included in the analysis is for cultivating
   Nannochloropsis Salina over an annual production cycle in California,
   United States of America. The dynamic optimization identified a set of
   operation profiles that reduced the cultivation cost by at least 15\% as
   opposed to relying on heuristic approaches for improving operation.}},

Abstract = {{We have developed a simple and sensitive method for the detection of
   influenza A virus based on giant magnetoresistance (GMR) biosensor. This
   assay employs monoclonal antibodies to viral nucleoprotein (NP) in
   combination with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs). Presence of influenza
   virus allows the binding of MNPs to the GMR sensor and the binding is
   proportional to the concentration of virus. Binding of MNPs onto the GMR
   sensor causes change in the resistance of sensor, which is measured in a
   real time electrical readout. GMR biosensor detected as low as 1.5 x
   10(2) TCID50/mL virus and the signal intensity increased with increasing
   concentration of virus up to 1.0 x 10(5) TCID50/mL. This study showed
   that the GMR biosensor assay is relevant for diagnostic application

   infected swine was reported to be in the range of 10(3) to 10(5)

Abstract = {{Ion gels are materials composed of an ionic liquid immobilized by a
   network-forming polymer, resulting in a soft solid with high ionic
   conductivity and tunable mechanical strength. Here, we demonstrate the
   thermoreversible gelation of a triblock terpolymer
   polyethylene-alt-propylene)-block-poly (ethylene
   oxide)-block-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PON) in the ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
   ({[}EMI]{[}TFSI]). At high temperature, the polymers self-assemble into
   micelles with P cores and ON coronas. Below the upper critical solution
   temperature of PNIPAm in this ionic liquid, the N blocks aggregate,
   resulting in macroscopic gelation. The ion gels were characterized at
   concentrations of 1,2, 5, and 10 wt \%. Rheological measurements
   demonstrated that the PON ion gels had a greater percentage of
   elastically effective strands, leading to significantly higher
   mechanical strength than for the corresponding NON ion gels. This is
   consistent with the expectation that an ABC terpolymer architecture can
   suppress looping of the middle blocks. A combination of small-angle
   X-ray scattering, rheology, and dynamic light scattering demonstrated
   that PON ion gels exhibited a broader sol-gel transition compared to
   previously studied PON hydrogels, a result which is attributed to the
   different thermoresponsive phase behavior of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
   in ionic liquids and water. Overall, this work demonstrates that the use
   of ABC triblock terpolymers allows for more efficient formation of
   strong ion gel networks at low polymer concentrations, which can be
   readily processed at moderate temperatures.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Abstract = {{Ni50-xCoxMn40Sn10 shape memory alloys in the approximate range 5 <= x <=
   8 display desirable properties for applications as well as intriguing
   magnetism. These off-stoichiometric Heusler alloys undergo a martensitic
   phase transformation at a temperature T-M of 300-400 K, from
   ferromagnetic (FM) to nonferromagnetic, with unusually low thermal
   hysteresis and a large change in magnetization. The low temperature
   magnetic structures in the martensitic phase of such alloys, which are
   distinctly inhomogeneous, are of great interest but are not well
   understood. Our present use of spin echo nuclear magnetic resonance in
   the large hyperfine fields at Mn-55 sites provides compelling evidence
   that nanoscale magnetic phase separation into FM and antiferromagnetic
   (AFM) regions occurs below T-M in alloys with x in the range 0 to 7. At
   finite Co substitution, the FM regions are found to be of two distinct
   types, corresponding to high and low local concentrations of Co on Ni
   sites. Estimates of the size distributions of both the FM and AFM
   nanoregions have been made. At x = 7, the AFM component is not
   long-range ordered, even below 4 K, and is quite different from the AFM
   component found at x = 0; by x = 14, the FM phase is completely
   dominant. Of particular interest, we find for x = 7 that field cooling
   leads to dramatic changes in the AFM regions. These findings provide
   insight into the origins of magnetic phase separation and
   superparamagnetism in these complex alloys, particularly their intrinsic
   exchange bias, which is of considerable current interest.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{MAR 21}},
Abstract = {{Fusion of donor mesenchymal stem cells with parenchymal cells of the
   recipient can occur in the brain, liver, intestine and heart following
   transplantation. The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant
   hybrids is unknown. Here we sought a global view of phenotypic
   diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and
   associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids
   consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated
   with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and
   decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. But in the
   case of most other gene groups, hybrids were individually distinct. In
   fact, though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual
   fusion partners, approximately one-third acquired distinct expression
   profiles in a single day. Some hybrids underwent reprogramming,
   expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental
   cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups.
   Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and
   two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast
   cancer cells, expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor
   genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners
   consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged
   tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental
   conditions that might promote fusion.}},

   Mechanisms in Ovarian Tumors}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Volume = {{11}},

Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{The majority of ovarian tumors eventually recur in a drug resistant
   form. Using cisplatin sensitive and resistant cell lines assembled into
   3D spheroids we profiled gene expression and identified candidate
   mechanisms and biological pathways associated with cisplatin resistance.
   OVCAR-8 human ovarian carcinoma cells were exposed to sub-lethal
   concentrations of cisplatin to create a matched cisplatin-resistant cell
   line, OVCAR-8R. Genome-wide gene expression profiling of sensitive and
   resistant ovarian cancer spheroids identified 3,331 significantly
   differentially expressed probesets coding for 3,139 distinct
   protein-coding genes (Fc > 2, FDR < 0.05) (S2 Table). Despite
   significant expression changes in some transporters including MDR1,
   cisplatin resistance was not associated with differences in
   intracellular cisplatin concentration. Cisplatin resistant cells were
   significantly enriched for a mesenchymal gene expression signature.
   OVCAR-8R resistance derived gene sets were significantly more biased to
   patients with shorter survival. From the most differentially expressed
   genes, we derived a 17-gene expression signature that identifies ovarian
   cancer patients with shorter overall survival in three independent
   datasets. We propose that the use of cisplatin resistant cell lines in
   3D spheroid models is a viable approach to gain insight into resistance
   mechanisms relevant to ovarian tumors in patients. Our data support the
   emerging concept that ovarian cancers can acquire drug resistance
   through an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.}},

Title = {{Extracellular matrix mediators of metastatic cell colonization
   characterized using scaffold mimics of the pre-metastatic niche}},
Journal = {{ACTA BIOMATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Metastatic tumor cells colonize the pre-metastatic niche, which is a
   complex microenvironment consisting partially of extracellular matrix
   (ECM) proteins. We sought to identify and validate novel contributors to
   tumor cell colonization using ECM-coated poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PCL) scaffolds as mimics of the pre metastatic niche. Utilizing
   orthotopic breast cancer mouse models, fibronectin and collagen
   IV-coated scaffolds implanted in the subcutaneous space captured
   colonizing tumor cells, showing a greater than 2-fold increase in tumor
   cell accumulation at the implant site compared to uncoated scaffolds. As
   a strategy to identify additional ECM colonization contributors,
   decellularized matrix (DCM) from lungs and livers containing metastatic
   tumors were characterized. In vitro, metastatic cell adhesion was
   increased on DCM coatings from diseased organs relative to healthy DCM.
   Furthermore, in vivo implantations of diseased DCM-coated scaffolds had
   increased tumor cell colonization relative to healthy DCM coatings.
   Mass-spectrometry proteomics was performed on healthy and diseased DCM
   to identify candidates associated with colonization. Myeloperoxidase was
   identified as abundantly present in diseased organs and validated as a
   contributor to colonization using myeloperoxidase-coated scaffold
   implants. This work identified novel ECM proteins associated with
   colonization using decellularization and proteomics techniques and
   validated candidates using a scaffold to mimic the pre-metastatic niche.
   Statement of Significance
   The pre-metastatic niche consists partially of ECM proteins that promote
   metastatic cell colonization to a target organ. We present a
   biomaterials-based approach to mimic this niche and identify ECM
   mediators of colonization. Using murine breast cancer models, we
   implanted microporous PCL scaffolds to recruit colonizing tumor cells in
   vivo. As a strategy to modulate colonization, we coated scaffolds with
   various ECM proteins, including decellularized lung and liver matrix
   from tumor-bearing mice. After characterizing the organ matrices using
   proteomics, myeloperoxidase was identified as an ECM protein
   contributing to colonization and validated using our scaffold. Our
   scaffold provides a platform to identify novel contributors to
   colonization and allows for the capture of colonizing tumor cells for a
   variety of downstream clinical applications. (C) 2016 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{Live attenuated vaccines such as SIV with a deleted nef gene have
   provided the most robust protection against subsequent vaginal challenge
   with wild-type (WT) SIV in the SIV-rhesus macaque model of HIV-1
   transmission to women. Hence, identifying correlates of this protection
   could enable design of an effective HIV-1 vaccine. One such prechallenge
   correlate of protection from vaginal challenge has recently been
   identified as a system with three components: 1) IgG Abs reacting with
   the viral envelope glycoprotein trimeric gp41; 2) produced by plasma
   cells in the submucosa and ectopic tertiary lymphoid follicles in the
   ectocervix and vagina; and 3) concentrated on the path of virus entry by
   the neonatal FcR in the overlying epithelium. We now examine the mucosal
   production of the Ab component of this system after vaginal challenge.
   We show that vaginal challenge immediately elicits striking increases in
   plasma cells not only in the female reproductive tract but also at other
   mucosal sites, and that these increases correlate with low but
   persistent replication at mucosal sites. We describe vaginal ectopic
   follicles that are structurally and functionally organized similar to
   follicles in secondary lymphoid organs, and we provide inferential
   evidence for a key role of the female reproductive tract epithelium in
   facilitating Ab production, affinity maturation, and class switch
   recombination. Vaccination thus accesses an epithelial-immune system
   axis in the female reproductive tract to respond to exposure to mucosal
   pathogens. Designing strategies to mimic this system could advance
   development of an effective HIV-1 vaccine.}},

Abstract = {{High flexibility skin-like sensors, such as electrical skin (e-skin)
   sensor for pressure measurement, have the potential to provide
   quantitative physical assessments and protection for human life. One
   promising application is to monitor the contact pressure of a
   colonoscope to the colonic wall during a colonoscopy to prevent
   perforation and hemorrhaging. Many attempts have been made to fabricate
   highly stretchable electronic devices. However, no effort has been made
   to investigate the mechanical behaviors of a tubular-shaped e-skin when
   bent, which is a typical working condition of such a sensor when
   attached to a colonoscope. The sensor should measure no pressure without
   external compressive force. However, bending of the sensor will generate
   measurable pressure, which is no use to doctor's diagnostic and causes
   disturbance to the doctor. This paper aims to compensate this false
   positive error to improve the sensor's reliability and accuracy. Based
   on a tubular-shaped, highly flexible skin-like sensor array we
   developed, we conducted both modeling and experimental studies on the
   change of the maximum pressure distribution of a tubular e-skin sensor
   under various bending conditions with and without external compressive
   force. This paper revealed the value of the maximum stress on a
   tubular-shaped e-skin sensor array when bent. The measuring errors due
   to bending in pressure detection during colonoscopy can be quantified
   for compensation. Thus, high accuracy diagnose can be achieved. These
   results could also be potentially used to address strategies on
   optimizing tactile sensor design for other medical applications.}},

   sensitivity, multi-functionality and integration of microfluidic
   paper-based analytical devices (mu PADs), increasingly suggests that
   this technology is not only attractive in resource-limited environments

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{144}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{We use pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method simulations to develop a
   quantitative phase diagram for the stretching of a real wormlike chain
   confined in a slit. Our simulations confirm the existence of a
   ``confined Pincus{''} regime in slit confinement, analogous to the
   Pincus regime in free solution, where excluded volume effects are
   sensible. The lower bound for the confined Pincus regime in the
   force-molecular weight plane, as well as the scaling of the extension
   with force and slit size, agree with an existing scaling theory for this
   regime. The upper bound of the confined Pincus regime depends on the
   strength of the confinement. For strong confinement, the confined Pincus
   regime ends when the contour length in the Pincus blob is too short to
   have intrablob excluded volume. As a result, the chain statistics become
   ideal and the confined Pincus regime at low forces is connected directly
   to ideal chain stretching at large forces. In contrast, for weak
   confinement, the confined Pincus regime ends when the Pincus blobs no
   longer fit inside the slit, even though there is sufficient contour
   length to have excluded volume inside the Pincus blob. As a result, weak
   confinement leads to a free-solution Pincus regime intervening between
   the confined Pincus regime for weak forces and ideal chain stretching at
   strong forces. Our results highlight shortcomings in existing models for
   the stretching of wormlike chains in slits. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used cationic lipid-poly(lactide-co-glycolide) acid
   (PLGA) hybrid nanoparticles as antigen delivery carriers to investigate
   how antigen-loading methods affect antigen exposure to the immune system
   and evaluated the resulting antigen-specific immune responses. We
   formulated three classes of antigen adsorbed and/or encapsulated
   cationic lipid-PLGA hybrid nanoparticles; we designated antigen-adsorbed
   (out), antigenen-capsulated (in), and antigen-adsorbed/encapsulated
   (both) nanoparticles. Our results demonstrate significantly more
   efficient lysosomal escape and cross-presentation of antigen from
   dendritic cells (DCs) that were exposed to ``both{''} and ``in{''}
   nanoparticles. In vivo experiments further revealed that ``both{''}
   nanoparticles significantly more effectively provided not only adequate
   initial antigen exposure but also long-term antigen persistence at the
   injection site. Data from flow cytometry and ELISA analyses demonstrated
   elevated in vivo immune responses from mice that were immunized with
   nanoparticles-delivered OVA when compared with free OVA. In addition,
   ``in{''} and ``both{''} nanoparticles elicited significantly higher
   antigen-specific immune response than ``out{''} nanoparticles and free
   OVA. These results suggest that the location of antigen entrapment is an
   important factor in modulating the immune responses of antigens
   delivered by nanoparticles. Overall, we propose here a promising
   approach for the future design of vaccines using cationic lipid-PLGA
   nanoparticles. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   bounds for the induced L-2 norm. The conditions for upper bounds are
   typically based on scaled small-gain theorems with dynamic multipliers
   or dissipation inequalities with parameter-dependent Lyapunov functions.
   This paper presents a complementary algorithm to compute lower bounds
   for the induced L-2 norm. The proposed approach computes a lower bound
   on the gain by restricting the parameter trajectory to be a periodic
   signal. This restriction enables the use of recent results for exact
   calculation of the L-2 norm for a periodic linear time varying system.
   The proposed lower bound algorithm also returns a worst-case parameter
   trajectory for the LPV system that can be further analyzed to provide
   insight into the system performance. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

   surface potential of C60 films with increasing thicknesses grown on P3HT
   to produce a surface potential profile normal to the substrate both in
   the dark and under illumination. The results confirm a space-charge
   carrier region with a thickness of 10 nm, consistent with previous
   observations. We discuss the possibility that the domain size in bulk

Abstract = {{Solid-state polymer electrolyte membranes (PEMs) exhibiting high ionic
   conductivity coupled with mechanical robustness and high thermal
   stability are vital for the design of next-generation lithium-ion
   batteries and high-temperature fuel cells. We present the in situ
   preparation of nanostructured PEMs incorporating a protic ionic liquid
   (IL) into one of the domains of a microphase-separated block copolymer
   created via polymerization induced microphase separation. This facile,
   one-pot synthetic strategy transforms a homogeneous liquid precursor
   consisting of a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) macro-chain-transfer agent,
   styrene and divinylbenzene monomers, and protic IL into a robust and
   transparent monolith. The resulting PEMs exhibit a bicontinuous
   morphology comprising PEO/protic IL conducting pathways and highly
   cross-linked polystyrene (PS) domains. The cross linked PS mechanical
   scaffold imparts thermal and mechanical stability to the PEMs, with an
   elastic modulus approaching 10 MPa at 180 degrees C, without sacrificing
   the ionic conductivity of the system. Crucially, the long-range
   continuity of the PEO/protic IL conducting nanochannels results in an
   outstanding ionic conductivity of 14 mS/cm at 180 degrees C. We posit
   that proton conduction in the protic IL occurs via the vehicular
   mechanism and the PEMs exhibit an average proton transference number of
   0.7. This approach is very promising for the development of
   high-temperature, robust PEMs with excellent proton conductivities.}},

Abstract = {{Ion gels composed of a copolymer and a room temperature ionic liquid are
   versatile solid-state electrolytes with excellent features including
   high ionic conductivity, nonvolatility, easily tunable mechanical
   properties, good flexibility and solution processability. Ion gels can
   be functionalized by incorporating redox-active species such as
   electrochemiluminescent (ECL) luminophores or electrochromic (EC) dyes.
   Here, we enhance the functionality of EC gels for realizing multicolored
   EC devices (ECDs), either by controlling the chemical equilibrium
   between a monomer and dimer of a colored EC species, or by modifying the
   molecular structures of the EC species. All devices in this work are
   conveniently fabricated by a ``cut-and-stick{''} strategy, and require
   very low power for maintaining the colored state {[}i.e., 90 mu W/cm(2)
   (113 mu A/cm(2) at -0.8 V) for blue, 4,mu W/cm(2) (10 mu A/cm(2) at -0.4
   V) for green, and 32 mu W/cm(2) (79 mu A/cm(2) at -0.4 V) for red ECD].
   We also successfully demonstrate a patterned, multicolored, flexible ECD
   on plastic. Overall, these results suggest that gel-based ECDs have
   significant potential as low power displays in printed electronics
   powered by thin-film batteries.}},

Abstract = {{Small biomolecular systems are inherently stochastic. Indeed,
   fluctuations of molecular species are substantial in living organisms
   and may result in significant variation in cellular phenotypes. The
   chemical master equation (CME) is the most detailed mathematical model
   that can describe stochastic behaviors. However, because of its
   complexity the CME has been solved for only few, very small reaction
   networks. As a result, the contribution of CME-based approaches to
   biology has been very limited. In this review we discuss the approach of
   solving CME by a set of differential equations of probability moments,
   called moment equations. We present different approaches to produce and
   to solve these equations, emphasizing the use of factorial moments and
   the zero information entropy closure scheme. We also provide information
   on the stability analysis of stochastic systems. Finally, we speculate
   on the utility of CME-based modeling formalisms, especially in the
   context of synthetic biology efforts.}},

Abstract = {{An analytical expression for the stationary particle charge distribution

   comparison with the results of Monte Carlo charging simulations. The
   relative importance of the existence of charge limits for various values
   of the ratio of electron-to-ion density and ion mass is examined, and
   the effect of charge limits on the transient behavior of the charge
   distribution is considered. It is found that the time required to reach
   a steady-state charge distribution strongly decreases as the charge
   limit decreases, and that the existence of charge limits causes
   high-frequency charge fluctuations to become relatively more important

Abstract = {{Tools and assays that characterize protein-protein interactions are of
   fundamental importance to biology, because protein assemblies play a
   critical role in the control and regulation of nearly every cellular
   process. The availability of fluorescent proteins has facilitated the
   direct and real-time observation of protein-protein interactions inside
   living cells, but existing methods are mostly limited to binary
   interactions between two proteins. Because of the scarcity of techniques
   capable of identifying ternary interactions, we developed tricolor
   heterospecies partition analysis. The technique is based on brightness
   analysis of fluorescence fluctuations from three fluorescent proteins
   that serve as protein labels. We identified three fluorescent proteins
   suitable for tricolor brightness experiments. In addition, we developed
   the theory of identifying interactions in a ternary protein system using
   tricolor heterospecies partition analysis. The theory was verified by
   experiments on well-characterized protein systems. A graphical
   representation of the heterospecies partition data was introduced to
   visualize interactions in ternary protein systems. Lastly, we performed
   fluorescence fluctuation experiments on cells expressing a coactivator
   and two nuclear receptors and applied heterospecies partition analysis
   to explore the interactions of this ternary protein system.}},

Abstract = {{Annealing colloidal nanocrystal coatings in a selenium-containing
   environment to form polycrystalline thin films of the earth-abundant
   solar absorber copper zinc tin sulfoselenide (CZTSSe) is an attractive
   approach for making solar cells. We used a closed selenization system to
   investigate how coatings comprising copper zinc tin sulfide (CZTS)
   nanocrystals evolve into polycrystalline CZTSSe thin films and studied
   the effects of selenium vapor pressure, annealing temperature, and
   heating rate. These studies revealed two different types of
   microstructures and two different grain growth mechanisms depending on
   whether the CZTS nanocrystals are exposed to selenium vapor only or to
   both selenium vapor and liquid selenium. Coatings annealed in the
   presence of selenium vapor form a microstructure comprising micron-size
   CZTSSe grains on top of a nanocrystalline, carbon-rich, CZTSSe layer.
   The film microstructure is controlled by concurrent normal and abnormal
   grain growth, and the grain size distribution is bimodal, similar to
   that observed when CZTS nanocrystal coatings are annealed in sulfur
   vapor. The size of the abnormal crystals increases with selenium
   pressure and temperature to as large as 4 mu m after annealing at 700
   degrees C in 450 Torr of selenium. Carbon, initially present on
   nanocrystals as dispersion stabilizing ligands, segregates to the region
   between the CZTSSe grains and the substrate instead of desorbing from
   the coating as volatile reaction products such as CSe2. Experiments
   suggest that carbon segregation occurs due to the tendency for CSe2 to
   polymerize and form (CSe2-x)(n). Coatings annealed in the presence of
   liquid selenium exhibit neither the bimodal grain size distribution nor
   the carbon-rich layer between CZTSSe grains and the substrate. In the
   presence of liquid selenium, the CZTS nanocrystals selenize, grow, and
   coarsen to similar to 1 mu m in size, forming compact CZTSSe films
   through liquid phase sintering, a mechanism wherein both grain size
   coarsening and film densification are mediated by the presence of a
   liquid phase.}},

   nanoribbon arrays}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{93}},

Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Interaction between localized plasmons in isolated proximal
   nanostructures is a well-studied phenomenon. Here we explore
   plasmon-plasmon interactions in connected extended systems. Such systems
   can now be easily produced experimentally using graphene. However, the
   mechanisms of plasmonic interactions in extended systems are not well
   understood. We employ finite-element methods to study these interactions
   in graphene superlattice nanoribbon arrays with a periodically modulated
   electrochemical potential or number of layers. We find a rich variation
   in the resulting plasmonic resonances depending on the dimensions, the
   electrochemical potentials (doping), and the separation of the
   nanoribbon segments, and we demonstrate the involvement of both
   transverse and longitudinal plasmon-plasmon interactions. For example,
   unlike predictions based on the well-known ``orbital hybridization
   model,{''} the energies of the resulting hybrid plasmonic resonances in
   the extended system can lie between the energies of the plasmons in the
   individual components. Our results demonstrate that the plasmonic
   spectra of graphene superlattice structures can be easily adjusted,
   continuously tuned, and used to enhance optical fields in the infrared
   and terahertz regions of the electromagnetic spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal optogenetic perturbation of brain circuit activity often
   requires light delivery in a precise spatial pattern that cannot be
   achieved with conventional optical fibers. We demonstrate an implantable
   silicon-based probe with a compact light delivery system, consisting of
   silicon nitride waveguides and grating couplers for out-of-plane light
   emission with high spatial resolution. 473 nm light is coupled into and
   guided in cm-long waveguide and emitted at the output grating coupler.
   Using the direct cutback and out-scattering measurement techniques, the
   propagation optical loss of the waveguide is measured to be below 3
   dB/cm. The grating couplers provide collimated light emission with
   sufficient irradiance for neural stimulation. Finally, a probe with
   multisite light delivery with three output grating emitters from a
   single laser input is demonstrated.}},

   moves are used to enhance sampling of the spatial distribution of the
   different ligands and to ensure that thermodynamic equilibrium is
   reached. At a temperature of 298 K, mixtures differing in length by four
   methylene units exhibit some degree of local segregation. In contrast,
   the hexanethiolate/tetradecanethiolate mixture yields Janus-like

Abstract = {{Water-mediated ion transport through functional nanoporous materials
   depends on the dynamics of water-confined within a given nanostructured
   morphology. Here, we investigate H-bonding dynamics of interfacial water
   within a ``normal{''} (Type I) lyotropic gyroid phase formed by a gemini
   dicarboxylate surfactant self-assembly using a combination of 2DIR
   spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Experiments and
   :simulations demonstrate that water dynamics in the normal gyroid phase
   is 1 order of magnitude slower than that in bulk water, due to specific
   interactions between water, the ionic surfactant headgroups, and
   counterions. Yet, the dynamics of water in the normal gyroid phase are
   faster than those of water confined in a reverse spherical micelle of a
   sulfonate surfactant, given that the water pool in the reverse micelle
   and the water, pore in the gyroid phase have roughly the same diameters.
   This difference in confined water dynamics likely arises from the
   significantly reduced curvature-induced frustration at the convex
   interfaces of the normal gyroid, as compared to the concave interfaces
   of a reverse spherical micelle. These detailed insights into confined
   water dynamics may guide the future design of artificial membranes that
   rapidly transport protons and other ions.}},

Title = {{Thermal Stabilization of Metal-Organic Framework-Derived Single Site
   Catalytic Clusters through Nanocasting}},

Abstract = {{Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) provide convenient systems for
   organizing high concentrations of single catalytic sites derived from
   metallic or oxo-metallic nodes. However, high-temperature processes
   cause agglomeration of these nodes, so that the single-site character
   and catalytic activity are lost. In this work, we present a simple
   nanocasting approach to provide a thermally stable secondary scaffold
   for MOP-based catalytic single sites, preventing their aggregation even
   after exposure to air at 600 degrees C. We describe the nanocasting of
   NU-1000, a MOP with 3 nm channels and Lewis-acidic oxozirconium
   clusters, with silica. By condensing tetramethylorthosilicate within the
   NU-1000 pores via a vapor-phase HCl treatment, a silica layer is created
   on the inner walls of NU-1000. This silica layer provides anchoring
   sites for the oxozirconium clusters in NU-1000 after the organic linkers
   are removed at high temperatures. Differential pair distribution
   functions obtained from synchrotron X-ray scattering confirmed that
   isolated oxozirconium clusters are maintained in the heated nanocast
   materials. Pyridine adsorption experiments and a glucose isomerization
   reaction demonstrate that the clusters remain accessible to reagents and
   maintain their acidic character and catalytic activity even after the
   nanocast materials have been heated to 500-600 degrees C in air. Density
   functional theory calculations show a correlation between the Lewis
   acidity of the oxozirconium clusters and their catalytic activity. The
   ability to produce MOF-derived materials that retain their catalytic
   properties after exposure to high temperatures makes nanocasting a
   useful technique for obtaining single-site catalysts suitable for
   high-temperature reactions.}},

Abstract = {{Recent theories predict that when a supercooled liquid approaches the
   glass transition, particle clusters with a special ``amorphous order{''}
   nucleate within the liquid, which lead to static correlations dictating
   the dramatic slowdown of liquid relaxation. The prediction, however, has
   yet to be verified in 3D experiments. Here, we design a colloidal
   system, where particles are confined inside spherical cavities with an
   amorphous layer of particles pinned at the boundary. Using this novel
   system, we capture the amorphousorder particle clusters and demonstrate
   the development of a static correlation. Moreover, by investigating the
   dynamics of spherically confined samples, we reveal a profound influence
   of the static correlation on the relaxation of colloidal liquids. In
   analogy to glass-forming liquids with randomly pinned particles, we
   propose a simple relation for the change of the configurational entropy
   of confined colloidal liquids, which quantitatively explains our
   experimental findings and illustrates a divergent static length scale
   during the colloidal glass transition.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{49}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 2}},
Abstract = {{We conducted laser light scattering (LLS) measurements in a 13.56 MHz
   capacitively coupled dusty plasma maintained in silane and argon to
   study the spatial distribution of silicon nanoparticles and nanoparticle
   agglomerates. Specifically, we focused on the temporal evolution of
   their spatial distribution in the plasma as a function of pressure and
   power. We observed three distinct types of temporal evolution behavior
   of the nanoparticle dust cloud in the plasma and classified these into
   three regimes based on pressure and power. Each regime features a
   distinct pattern in laser light scattering measurements. At low
   pressures (similar to 80-100 mTorr) and high powers (similar to 40-60 W)
   we observed periodically repeating expansions and contractions of a
   continuous dust cloud for the first time. Dust voids, which have been
   reported before, were also observed at high pressures (similar to
   100-150 mTorr) and low powers (similar to 20-40 W) in the center of the
   plasma. A mechanism is proposed to explain the observed dynamics of the
   nanoparticles. The balance between the ion drag force and electrostatic
   forces and their dependence on particle size are hypothesized to be the
   dominant factors that determine the nanoparticle cloud dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon quantum dots (SiQDs), with their broad absorption, narrow and

   successfully produced highly luminescent, hydrophilic SiQDs with
   long-term stability in water using non-thermal plasma techniques.
   Hydrogen-terminated SiQDs were produced in a low-pressure plasma and
   subsequently treated in water using an atmospheric-pressure plasma jet
   for surface modification. Preliminary assessments of the chemical
   mechanism(s) involved in the creation of water-soluble SiQDs were
   performed using Fenton's reaction and various plasma chemistries,

Abstract = {{Molecular simulations with a resolved surface microstructure were
   performed for high-temperature dissociated oxygen reacting with a
   carbon-carbon composite material. The direct simulation Monte Carlo
   method was used to simulate the convection and diffusion of reactants
   toward the microstructure and the transport of surface reaction products
   away from the microstructure. Simulations were performed with and
   without gas-phase chemical reactions to determine the relative
   importance of gas-surface reactions compared to gas-phase reactions next
   to the material surface. The simulations incorporated reaction
   probabilities for individual gas-surface collisions based on new
   reactive scattering data obtained from molecular beam experiments. The
   experiments provide detailed dynamical data on the scattering of O, O-2,
   CO, and CO2 from a representative material sample, made of vitreous
   carbon. These experiments indicate that a majority of surface reaction
   products were produced through thermal mechanisms. For a gas-surface
   temperature of 800 K, it was found that despite CO being the dominant
   surface reaction product, a gas-phase reaction forms significant CO2
   within the microstructure region. The amount of CO2 production within
   the microstructure region was shown to be dependent on the local Knudsen
   number, based on the exposed microstructure height. Finally, preliminary
   simulations were performed for a real carbon-carbon surface. The surface
   topography is obtained through x-ray microtomography of an ablated
   carbon-carbon sample, which is triangulated and used directly within a
   direct simulation Monte Carlo simulation of the gas-surface interaction.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{151-158}},

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity is one of the most significant epidemiological
   trends of the last decades. Recently it was found that obese individuals
   show postural instability. Balance control mechanisms in obese older
   adults were less studied. Therefore we aimed to investigate the effect
   of obesity on balance control mechanisms in older adults.
   Methods: Parameters from Stabilogram-Diffusion Analysis (SDA) and
   measures from summary statistics of foot centre-of-pressure (COP)
   displacements along the anterior-posterior (AP) and mediolateral (ML)
   directions in eyes open and eyes closed conditions were used to
   characterize postural control in 22 obese (30-<35 kg/m(2)), 26
   overweight (25-<30 kg/m(2)), and 18 normal weight subjects (18.5-<25
   kg/m(2)).
   Results: Obese group subjects demonstrated significantly greater
   transition displacement, transition time interval, and short-term
   scaling exponent in the ML-direction compared with the normal weight
   group (eyes open and closed). In the AP-direction the obese group showed
   greater transition displacement (eyes open) and short-term scaling
   exponent (eyes open and closed). Average AP-COP and ML-COP ranges of COP
   sway were higher in the obese group compared with the normal weight
   group (eyes open and closed).
   Conclusions: This work indicates an altered postural control process in
   obese older adults. A greater sway displacement before closed-loop
   feedback mechanisms are called into play was seen in the ML direction
   that may lead to a higher risk of instability and fall events. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{We consider the dynamic pricing problem a monopolistic seller faces when
   customers arrive in heterogeneous time periods and their purchase
   decisions are affected by reference prices formed from their past
   observations of prices. We illustrate that a new form of price
   discrimination opportunity exists in such situations, where the seller's
   optimal pricing strategy is a cyclic one, even when the customers are
   loss-neutral and their demand functions are identical. This result
   differs from those of prior studies where the optimal price paths are
   shown to be asymptotically constant and thus is unique due to the
   interaction between the heterogeneous arrivals and the reference price
   effects. We also provide the cycle length of the optimal pricing policy
   when the demand function is linear and when customers are loss-neutral.
   In this era when customer information is easier accessible, our results
   suggest the sellers consider this new dimension of price discrimination
   in conjunction with the old ones, to take advantage of the full power of
   customer data.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a seller's problem of determining revenue-maximizing prices
   for an assortment of products that exhibit network effects. Customers
   make purchase decisions according to a multinomial logit choice model,
   modified-to incorporate network effects-so that the utility each
   individual customer gains from purchasing a particular product depends
   on the market's total consumption of that product. In the setting of
   homogeneous products, we show that if the network effect is
   comparatively weak, then the optimal pricing decision of the seller is
   to set identical prices for all products. However, if the network effect
   is strong, then the optimal pricing decision is to set the price of one
   product low and to set the prices of all other products to a single high
   value. This boosts the sales of the single low-price product in
   comparison to the sales of all other products. We also obtain
   comparative statics results that describe how optimal prices and sales
   levels vary with a parameter that determines the strength of the network
   effects. We extend our analysis to settings with heterogeneous products
   and establish that optimal solutions have a structure similar to that
   found in the homogeneous case: either maintain a semblance of balance
   among all products or boost the sales of just one product. Based on this
   structure, we propose an effective computational algorithm for such
   general heterogeneous settings.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The operation of an integrated two-dimensional complementary
   metal-oxide-semiconductor inverter with well-matched input/output
   voltages is reported. The circuit combines a few-layer MoS2 n-MOSFET and
   a black phosphorus (BP) p-MOSFET fabricated using a common local
   backgate electrode with thin (20 nm) HfO2 gate dielectric. The
   constituent devices have linear threshold voltages of -0.8 V and +0.8 V
   and produce peak transconductances of 16 mu S mu m(-1) and 41 mu S mu
   m(-1) for the MoS2 n-MOSFET and BP p-MOSFET, respectively. The inverter
   shows a voltage gain of 3.5 at a supply voltage, V-DD = 2.5 V, and has
   peak switching current of 108 mu A and off-state current of 8.4 mu A
   (2.4 mu A) at V-IN = 0 (V-IN = 2.5 V). In addition, the inverter has
   voltage gain greater than unity for V-DD >= 0.5 V, has open butterfly
   curves for V-DD >= 1 V, and achieves static noise margin over 500 mV at
   V-DD = 2.5 V. The voltage gain was found to be insensitive to
   temperature between 270 and 340 K, and A Clarge and small-signal
   operation was demonstrated at frequencies up to 100 kHz. The
   demonstration of a complementary 2D inverter which operates in a
   symmetric voltage window suitable for driving a subsequent logic stage
   is a significant step forward in developing practical applications for
   devices based upon 2D materials.}},

Title = {{Direct numerical simulation of sharkskin denticles in turbulent channel
   flow}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The hydrodynamic function of sharkskin has been under investigation for
   the past 30 years. Current literature conflicts on whether sharkskin is
   able to reduce skin friction similar to riblets. To contribute insights
   toward reconciling these conflicting views, direct numerical simulations
   are carried out to obtain detailed flow fields around realistic
   denticles. A sharp interface immersed boundary method is employed to
   simulate two arrangements of actual sharkskin denticles (from Isurus
   oxyrinchus) in a turbulent boundary layer at Re-t approximate to 180.
   For comparison, turbulent flow over drag-reducing scalloped riblets is
   also simulated with similar flow conditions and with the same numerical
   method. Although the denticles resemble riblets, both sharkskin
   arrangements increase total drag by 44\%-50\%, while the riblets reduce
   drag by 5\%. Analysis of the simulated flow fields shows that the
   turbulent flow around denticles is highly three-dimensional and
   separated, with 25\% of the total drag being form drag. The complex
   three-dimensional shape of the denticles gives rise to a mean flow
   dominated by strong secondary flows in sharp contrast with the mean flow
   generated by riblets, which is largely two-dimensional. The so resulting
   three-dimensionality of sharkskin flows leads to an increase in the
   magnitude of the turbulent statistics near the denticles, which further
   contributes to increasing the total drag. The simulations also show
   that, at least for the simulated arrangements, sharkskin, in sharp
   contrast with drag-reducing riblets, is unable to isolate high shear
   stress near denticle ridges causing a significant portion of the
   denticle surface to be exposed to high mean shear. (C) 2016 AIP

Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{3791-3800}},

Abstract = {{The effect of thickness, temperature, and source drain bias voltage,
   V-DS, on the subthreshold slope, SS, and off-state properties of black
   phosphorus (BP) fieldeffect transistors is reported. Locally back-gated
   pMOSFETs with thin HfO2 gate dielectrics were analyzed using exfoliated
   BP layers ranging in thickness from to 14 nm. SS was found to degrade
   with increasing VD5 and to a greater extent in thicker flakes. In one of
   the thinnest devices, SS values as low as 126 mV/decade were achieved at
   Vim = 0.1 V, and the devices displayed record performance at VDs = 1.0 V
   with SS = 161 mV/decade and on-to-off current ratio of 2.84 X 10(3)
   within a 1 V gate bias window. A one-dimensional transport model has
   been utilized to extract the band gap, interface state density, and the
   work function of the metal contacts. The model shows that SS degradation
   in BP MOSFETs occurs due to the ambipolar turn on of the carriers
   injected at the drain before the onset of purely thermionic-limited
   transport at the source. The model is further utilized to provide design
   guidelines for achieving ideal SS and meet off -state leakage targets,
   and it is found that band edge work functions and thin flakes are
   required for ideal operation at high VDs. This work represents a
   comprehensive analysis of the fundamental performance limitations of
   Schottky -contacted BP MOSFETs under realistic operating conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A large number of geo-distributed data centers begin to surge in the era
   of data deluge and information explosion. To meet the growing demand in
   massive data processing, the infrastructure of future data centers must
   be energy-efficient and sustainable. Facing this challenge, a systematic
   framework is put forth in this paper to integrate renewable energy
   sources (RES), distributed storage units, cooling facilities, as well as
   dynamic pricing into the workload and energy management tasks of a data
   center network. To cope with RES uncertainty, the resource allocation
   task is formulated as a robust optimization problem minimizing the
   worst-case net cost. Compared with existing stochastic optimization
   methods, the proposed approach entails a deterministic uncertainty set
   where generated RES reside, thus can be readily obtained in practice. It
   is further shown that the problem can be cast as a convex program, and
   then solved in a distributed fashion using the dual decomposition
   method. By exploiting the spatio-temporal diversity of local
   temperature, workload demand, energy prices, and renewable availability,
   the proposed approach outperforms existing alternatives, as corroborated
   by extensive numerical tests performed using real data.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum leasing has been proposed as an effective approach for enabling
   more flexible spectrum utilization in CRNs. In CRNs, a primary network
   (PN) which consists of multiple primary users (PUs) can lease part of
   the licensed spectrum to secondary users (SUs) in exchange for
   operational benefits. The focus of this study is to investigate how and
   to what extent the PN allows spectrum leasing in CRNs, considering the
   QoS requirements of the PN and the secondary network (SN).
   Correspondingly, we propose two dynamic spectrum leasing strategies,
   which can improve the QoS performance of SUs while ensuring sufficient
   remuneration for PUs. In order to dynamically adjust the portion of
   leased bandwidth, two forms of leasing algorithms, which are based on
   channel occupancy of the PN and the SN respectively are proposed.
   Analytical models are developed to characterize system centric
   performance metrics including capacity, blocking probability, and forced
   termination probability in both networks. Furthermore, a dynamic pricing
   scheme for spectrum leasing and utility-based resource allocation is
   introduced. Finally the performance of dynamic leasing is compared
   quantitatively with that of static leasing and approaches without
   leasing. Numerical results obtained from both analysis and simulations
   show that dynamically adjusted spectrum leasing improves network
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Practical implementations of the power electronics required to operate
   bearingless machines with the so-called ``dual-purpose no-voltage{''}
   (DPNV) windings are proposed. These windings enable a bearingless
   machine to use the same coils to produce both radial suspension forces
   and torque, which has been shown in the literature to enable better
   machine performance. In this paper, the use of two-level inverters is
   investigated for the two configurations of DPNV windings: the
   ``parallel{''} and ``bridge{''} configurations. The investigation is
   valid for conventional p +/- 1 pole-pair bearingless motors (i.e.,
   bearingless permanent magnet and induction motors) and p = 1bearingless
   motors (bearingless ac homopolar and consequent-pole motors). The
   advantages and disadvantages of each configuration are explored in terms
   of control complexity and required hardware, potential paths for
   circulating currents are identified along with mitigation strategies,
   and experimental results are presented to validate the proposed power
   electronic implementation.}},

Title = {{Toughening Glassy Poly(lactide) with Block Copolymer Micelles}},
Journal = {{ACS MACRO LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Poly(lactide) (PLA), a compostable bioderived polyester, can be produced
   at a cost and scale that makes it an attractive replacement for
   nondegradable petroleum-derived thermoplastics. However, pristine PLA is
   brittle and unsuitable for use in applications where high impact
   strength and ductility are required. In this work we demonstrate that
   poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) in the glassy state can be toughened
   significantly via addition of an amphiphilic diblock polymer. Notably, a
   PLLA blend containing only 5 wt\% poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(butylene
   oxide) (PEO-PBO) exhibited tensile toughness and notched Izod impact
   strength over an order of magnitude higher than neat amorphous PLLA
   without a significant reduction in transparency or elastic modulus. For
   a series of PLLA blends containing PEO-PBO of fixed composition (similar
   to 70\% volume fraction PBO), the toughness was inversely related to the
   molar mass of the added modifier with the highest toughness observed for
   the blend containing the smallest diblock (similar to 7 kg/mol).
   Interestingly, at fixed composition and molar mass
   poly(L-lactide)-b-poly(butylene oxide) (PLLA PBO) exhibited a
   substantial but reduced toughening efficiency compared to PEO-PBO. We
   attribute this difference to a change in the solubility parameter of the
   amphiphilc block. Using TEM, we show that the greatest toughening is
   observed when the diblock modifier forms small cylindrical micelles that
   are well dispersed in the PLLA matrix. This morphology is facilitated by
   a negative Flory-Huggins interaction parameter (chi) between PEO and
   PLLA. These insights suggest a new and versatile strategy for the facile
   and efficient toughening of brittle thermoplastics.}},

Abstract = {{Fully sustainable poly{[}HPMC-g-(PMVL-b-PLLA)] graft block copolymer
   thermoplastics were prepared from hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC),
   beta-methyl-delta-valerolactone (MVL), and L-lactide (LLA) using a
   facile two-step sequential addition approach. In these materials,
   rubbery PMVL functions as a bridge between the semirigid HPMC backbone
   and the hard PLLA end blocks. This specific arrangement facilitates PLLA
   crystallization, which induces microphase separation and physical
   cross-linking. By changing the backbone molar mass or side chain
   composition, these thermoplastic materials can be easily tailored to
   access either plastic or elastomeric behavior. Moreover, the graft block
   architecture can be utilized to overcome the processing limitations
   inherent to linear block polymers. Good control over molar mass and
   composition enables the. deliberate design of HPMC-g-(PMVL-b-PLLA)
   samples that are incapable of microphase separation in the melt state.
   These materials are characterized by relatively low zero shear
   viscosities in the melt state, an indication of easy processability. The
   simple and scalable synthetic procedure, use of inexpensive and
   renewable precursors, and exceptional rheological and mechanical
   properties make HPMC-g-(PMVL-b-PLLA) polymers attractive for a broad
   range of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Although losses in plasmonic films can be detrimental for

   peak wavelength (3.5 mu m) can be tuned with groove periodicity. To
   enhance the thermal stability of the structures, we add a thin layer of

Abstract = {{Disease progression models, statistical models that assess a patient's
   risk of diabetes progression, are popular tools in clinical practice for
   prevention and management of chronic conditions. Most, if not all,
   models currently in use are based on gold standard clinical trial data.
   The relatively small sample size available from clinical trial limits
   these models only considering the patient's state at the time of the
   assessment and ignoring the trajectory, the sequence of events, that led
   up to the state. Recent advances in the adoption of electronic health
   record (EHR) systems and the large sample size they contain have paved
   the way to build disease progression models that can take trajectories
   into account, leading to increasingly accurate and personalized
   assessment. To address these problems, we present a novel method to
   observe trajectories directly. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method by studying type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
   trajectories. Specifically, using EHR data for a large population-based
   cohort, we identified a typical trajectory that most people follow,
   which is a sequence of diseases from hyperlipidemia (HLD) to
   hypertension (HTN), impaired fasting glucose (IFG), and T2DM. In
   addition, we also show that patients who follow different trajectories

Abstract = {{The liver is an ideal target for nucleic acid therapeutic applications
   (i.e., siRNA, gene therapy, and genome editing) due to its ability to
   secrete proteins into the blood. In this work, we present the first
   synthesis of a novel monomer derived from N-acetyl-D-galactosamine
   (GalNAc) and its polymerization as a facile route to create multivalent
   delivery vehicles with exceptional targeting efficiency to
   asialoglycoprotein receptors (ASGPRs) on liver hepatocytes. A series of
   cationic diblock GalNAc glycopolymers composed of a GalNAc-derived block
   of fixed length (n = 62) and cationic 2-aminoethylmethacrylamide (AEMA)
   blocks of varying lengths (n = 19, 33, and 80) have been synthesized and
   characterized. In addition, nontargeted control polymers consisting of
   either glucose or polyethylene glycol-derived neutral blocks with an
   AEMA cationic block were also created and examined. All polymeric
   vehicles were able to bind and encapsulate plasmids (pDNA) into
   polymerpDNA complexes (polyplexes). The GalNAc-derived polyplexes were
   colloidally stable and maintained their size over a period of 4 h in
   reduced-serum cell culture media. The GalNAc-derived homopolymer
   effectively inhibited the uptake of Cy5-labeled asialofetuin (a natural
   ligand of ASGPRs) by cultured hepatocyte (HepG2) cells at lower
   concentrations (IC50 = 20 nM) than monomeric GalNAc (IC50 = 1 mM) and
   asialofetuin (IC50 = 1 mu M), suggesting highly enhanced ASGPR binding
   due to multivalency. These polymers also showed cell type-specific gene
   expression in cultured cells, with higher protein expression in
   ASGPR-presenting HepG2 than HeLa cells, which lack the receptor.
   Biodistribution studies in mice show higher accumulation of pDNA and
   GalNAc-derived polymers in the liver compared with the glucose-derived
   nontargeted control. This study demonstrates the first facile synthesis
   of a multivalent GalNAc-derived block copolymer architecture that
   promotes enhanced delivery to liver and offers insights to improve
   targeted nanomedicines for a variety of applications.}},

Title = {{Repeatability of muscle synergies within and between days for typically

Abstract = {{Muscle synergies are typically calculated from electromyographic (EMG)
   signals using nonnegative matrix factorization. Synergies identify
   weighted groups of muscles that are commonly activated together during a
   task, such as walking. Synergy analysis has become an emerging tool to
   evaluate neuromuscular control; however, the repeatability of synergies
   between trials and days has not been evaluated. The goal of this study
   was to evaluate the repeatability of synergy complexity and structure in
   unimpaired individuals and individuals with cerebral palsy (CP). EMG
   data were collected from eight lower-limb muscles during gait for six
   typically developing (TD) children and five children with CP on two
   separate days, over three walking speeds. To evaluate synergy
   complexity, we calculated the total variance accounted for by one
   synergy (tVAF(1)). On a given day, the average range in tVAF(1) between
   gait cycles was 18.2\% for TD and 19.1\% for CP. The average standard
   deviation in tVAF(1) between gait cycles was 4.9\% for TD and 5.0\% for
   CP. Average tVAF(1) calculated across gait cycles was not significantly
   different between days for TD or CP participants. Comparing synergy
   structure, the average (standard deviation) within day correlation
   coefficients of synergy weights for two or more synergies were 0.89
   (0.15) for TD and 0.88 (0.15) for CP. Between days, the average
   correlation coefficient of synergy weights for two or more synergies was
   greater than 0.89 for TD and 0.74 for CP. These results demonstrate that
   synergy complexity and structure averaged over multiple gait cycles are
   repeatable between days in both TD and CP groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{Big data for social transportation brings us unprecedented opportunities
   for resolving transportation problems for which traditional approaches
   are not competent and for building the next-generation intelligent
   transportation systems. Although social data have been applied for
   transportation analysis, there are still many challenges. First, social
   data evolve with time and contain abundant information, posing a crucial
   need for data collection and cleaning. Meanwhile, each type of data has
   specific advantages and limitations for social transportation, and one
   data type alone is not capable of describing the overall state of a
   transportation system. Systematic data fusing approaches or frameworks
   for combining social signal data with different features, structures,
   resolutions, and precision are needed. Second, data processing and
   mining techniques, such as natural language processing and analysis of
   streaming data, require further revolutions in effective utilization of
   real-time traffic information. Third, social data are connected to cyber
   and physical spaces. To address practical problems in social
   transportation, a suite of schemes are demanded for realizing big data
   in social transportation systems, such as crowdsourcing, visual
   analysis, and task-based services. In this paper, we overview data
   sources, analytical approaches, and application systems for social
   transportation, and we also suggest a few future research directions for
   this new social transportation field.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{31}},

Abstract = {{Integrating renewable energy into the modern power grid requires
   risk-cognizant dispatch of resources to account for the stochastic
   availability of renewables. Toward this goal, day-ahead stochastic
   market clearing with high-penetration wind energy is pursued in this
   paper based on the DC optimal power flow (OPF). The objective is to
   minimize the social cost which consists of conventional generation
   costs, end-user disutility, as well as a risk measure of the system
   re-dispatching cost. Capitalizing on the conditional value-at-risk
   (CVaR), the novel model is able to mitigate the potentially high risk of
   the recourse actions to compensate wind forecast errors. The resulting
   convex optimization task is tackled via a distribution-free sample
   average based approximation to bypass the prohibitively complex
   high-dimensional integration. Furthermore, to cope with possibly
   large-scale dispatchable loads, a fast distributed solver is developed
   with guaranteed convergence using the alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM). Numerical results tested on a modified benchmark
   system are reported to corroborate the merits of the novel framework and
   proposed approaches.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the electro-optic properties of black phosphorus (BP)
   thin films for optical modulation in the mid-infrared frequencies. Our
   calculation indicates that an applied out-of-plane electric field may
   lead to red-, blue-, or bidirectional shift in BP's absorption edge.
   This is due to the interplay between the field-induced quantum-confined
   Franz-Keldysh effect and the Pauli-blocked Burstein-Moss shift. The
   relative contribution of the two electro-absorption mechanisms depends
   on doping range, operating wavelength, and BP film thickness. For
   proof-of concept, simple modulator configuration with BP overlaid over a
   silicon nanowire is studied. Simulation results show that operating BP
   in the quantum-confined Franz-Keldysh regime can improve the maximal
   attainable absorption as well as power efficiency compared to its
   graphene counterpart.}},

Abstract = {{We combine atomic layer lithography and glancing angle ion polishing to
   create wafer-scale metamaterials composed of dense arrays of ultrasmall
   coaxial nanocavities in gold films. This new fabrication scheme makes it
   possible to shrink the diameter and increase the packing density of 2
   nm-gap coaxial resonators, an extreme subwavelength structure first
   manufactured via atomic layer lithography, both by a factor of 100 with
   respect to previous studies. We demonstrate that the nonpropagating
   zeroth-order Fabry-Perot mode, which possesses slow light-like
   properties at the cutoff resonance, traps infrared light inside 2 nm
   gaps (gap volume similar to lambda(3)/10(6)). Notably, the annular gaps
   cover only 3\% or less of the metal surface, while open-area normalized
   transmission is as high as 1700\% at the epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)
   condition. The resulting energy accumulation alongside extraordinary
   optical transmission can benefit applications in nonlinear optics,
   optical trapping, and surface-enhanced spectroscopies. Furthermore,
   because the resonance wavelength is independent of the cavity length and
   dramatically red shifts as the gap size is reduced, large-area arrays
   can be constructed with lambda(resonance) >> period, making this
   fabrication method ideal for manufacturing resonant metamaterials.}},

Abstract = {{The cleavage of recalcitrant C-N linkages in heteroaromatic molecules is
   a critical component of hydro-denitrogenation (HDN) reactions, the
   processes by which N atoms are removed from crude fuels. C-N bond
   cleavage of heteroaromatics with traditional HDN catalysts such as
   sulfided Ni/Mo-Al2O3 and Ni/W-Al2O3 requires aggressive conditions to
   hydrogenate the heterocyclic rings and often unnecessarily saturates the
   carbocyclic rings as part of the C-N cleavage process. In contrast,
   small-molecule models have illustrated selective hydrogenation of the
   heterocyclic ring, providing mechanistic insight into HDN processes and
   inspiring the design of new, more selective HDN catalysts.}},

Abstract = {{Inhibition of p-xylene isomerization in the presence of H-Y (Si/Al 2.6)
   and H-BEA (Si/Al 12.5) zeolites was studied under conditions relevant to
   p-xylene production from 2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and ethylene. Through
   examination of the reaction components, it was shown that both DMF and
   2,5-hexanedione inhibit transalkylation and methyl shift reactions of
   p-xylene, while other reaction components, water and ethylene, do not.
   Retention of Bronsted acid sites after the reaction was shown through
   the use of Al-27 NMR for both H-Y and H-BEA zeolites, but with a
   reduction in the ratio of tetrahedrally coordinated aluminum (strong
   acid sites) to octahedrally coordinated aluminum (Lewis acid sites)
   coinciding with the disappearance of the framework aluminum. Diffuse
   reflectance spectroscopy has shown preferential adsorption of DMF and
   2,5-hexanedione (DMF + H2O) relative to p-xylene to the Bronsted acid
   sites located in the super and sodalite cages of the H-Y. Desorption
   characteristics for DMF and p-xylene in H-Y and H-BEA were determined by
   thermogravimetric analysis, consistent with adsorption energetics of
   individual chemical species and dimeric complexes evaluated by an ONIOM
   method. Evaluation of three mechanisms, allowing for production of
   p-xylene from DMF and ethylene while also inhibiting p-xylene
   isomerization, supports high surface coverage of the active site with
   2,5-hexanedione, supported by electronic structure calculations.}},

   developed to predict the change in solubility both due to pressurization
   and due to the temperature increase associated with adiabatic
   compression of the solution. These models were validated experimentally

Abstract = {{The scattering of electromagnetic waves by periodic layered media plays
   a crucial role in many applications in optics and photonics, in
   particular in nanoplasmonics for topics as diverse as extraordinary
   optical transmission, photonic crystals, metamaterials, and surface
   plasmon resonance biosensing. With these applications in mind, we focus
   on surface plasmon resonances excited in the context of insulator-metal
   structures with a periodic, corrugated interface. The object of this
   contribution is to study the geometric limits required to generate these
   fundamentally important phenomena. For this we use the robust, rapid,
   and highly accurate field expansions method to investigate these
   delicate phenomena and demonstrate how very small perturbations (e.g., a
   5 nm deviation on a 530 nm period grating) can generate strong (in this
   instance 20\%) plasmonic absorption, and vanishingly small perturbations
   (e.g., a 1 nm deviation on a 530 nm period grating) can generate
   nontrivial (in this instance 1\%) plasmonic absorption. (C) 2016 Optical

Abstract = {{In a previous work, we presented a numerical method for retrieving
   inhomogeneous refractive index fields in rectangular gradient-index
   elements from boundary positions and internal boundary slopes associated
   with a set of interrogating probe beams that transit the medium. The
   present work extends this method to external boundary beam slopes
   without knowledge of the refractive index along the surface of the
   optical element, requiring minimal additional information (outside of
   beam position and slope data) such as a single known index point inside
   the medium. The inverse problem is cast as a linear algebraic system
   describing the deflection of probe beams inside the optical material,
   and an iterative inversion algorithm is used to generate an index field
   that produces the boundary value data. By incorporating Snell's law into
   the system equation through surface values derived from tentative
   reconstructions of the refractive index, we show in simulation that a
   series of inversion cycles applied to the system equation accurately
   recovers the index profile used to generate the test data. (C) 2016

Abstract = {{A pervasive limitation of nearly all practical X-ray methods for the
   determination of the atomic scale structure of matter is the need to
   crystallize the molecule, compound or alloy in a sufficiently large

   method applicable to structure determination of some important
   noncrystalline structures is proposed. It is designed according to a
   strict mathematical analog of von Laue's method, but replacing the
   translation group by another symmetry group, and simultaneously
   replacing plane waves by different exact closed-form solutions of
   Maxwell's equations. Details are presented for helical structures like
   carbon nanotubes or filamentous viruses. In computer simulations the
   accuracy of the determination of structure is shown to be comparable to

Abstract = {{Biofilters, bioreactors used for pollution control, can effectively
   treat a variety of odorous and hazardous emissions, but uncertain medium
   longevities and associated costs limit biofilter adoption. To improve
   medium-life estimations for biofilter end-users, litter bags were used
   to compare decay rates of common biofilter medium types and test the
   effects of nitrogen (N) enrichment and livestock production emissions on
   medium decay in a full-scale biofilter over a 27-month period.
   Generally, ``by-product{''} media (mulch, corn cobs) decayed faster than
   hardwood media, with decay of softwood media the slowest. Analysis
   showed nutrient content was the best predictor of early-stage decay,
   while carbon fractions and nutrient content best predicted medium
   longevity. N amendments and N-rich barn emissions were found to hasten
   medium decay. By identifying decay rates and rate predictors specific
   for biofilter media, we provide biofilter engineers and farmers with a
   quantitative way to improve medium selection based on the trade-offs
   between medium cost and replacement frequency.}},

Abstract = {{To identify genes and signaling pathways that initiate Neurofibromatosis
   type 1 (NF1) neurofibromas, we used unbiased insertional mutagenesis
   screening, mouse models, and molecular analyses. We mapped an
   Nf1-Stat3-Arid1b/beta-catenin pathway that becomes active in the context
   of Nf1 loss. Genetic deletion of Stat3 in Schwann cell progenitors
   (SCPs) and Schwann cells (SCs) prevents neurofibroma formation,
   decreasing SCP self-renewal and beta-catenin activity. beta-catenin
   expression rescues effects of Stat3 loss in SCPs. Importantly, P-STAT3
   and beta-catenin expression correlate in human neurofibromas.
   Mechanistically, P-Stat3 represses Gsk3 beta and the SWI/SNF gene Arid1b
   to increase beta-catenin. Knockdown of Arid1b or Gsk3 beta in
   Stat3(fl/fl); Nf1(fl/fl); DhhCre SCPs rescues neurofibroma formation
   after in vivo transplantation. Stat3 represses Arid1b through histone
   modification in a Brg1-dependent manner, indicating that epigenetic
   modification plays a role in early tumorigenesis. Our data map a neural
   tumorigenesis pathway and support testing JAK/STAT and Wnt/beta-catenin
   pathway inhibitors in neurofibroma therapeutic trials.}},

Abstract = {{Many communities located in natural resource rich landscapes have
   transitioned to tourism-based economies. This transition might not be
   sustainable, as climate and environmental change have unknown effects on
   the visitation patterns of outdoor recreationists and tourists. We
   address this uncertainty by estimating shifts in the demand for outdoor
   recreation destinations along Minnesota's North Shore region of Lake
   Superior under a range of projected climatic and environmental
   conditions. We also employ a finite-mixture modeling approach to capture
   the preference heterogeneity across North Shore visitors. Our findings
   indicate projected climate and environmental changes are not likely to
   significantly affect visitation patterns in the next 20 years. However,
   utilizing a finite-mixture modeling approach enabled us to identify
   distinct types of visitors with divergent visitation behaviors under
   altered climate and environmental conditions. Our findings suggest that
   the demand for outdoor recreation along the North Shore will be
   relatively stable in the near future, however different types of
   visitors will respond to warming winter conditions in divergent ways.
   Shifting visitation patterns under climate and environmental change may
   have more drastic alterations to the economic well-being of the region
   under a longer planning horizon. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Anaerobic fermentation can transform carbohydrates to yield a
   multicomponent mixture comprising mainly of acetone, 1-butanol, and
   ethanol (ABE) in a typical weight ratio of 3:6:1. Compared to ethanol,
   1-butanol, the main product of ABE fermentation, offers significant
   advantages as a biofuel or a fuel additive. However, the toxicity of
   1-butanol for cell cultures requires broth concentrations to be low in
   1-butanol (approximate to 1-2 wt\%). An energy-efficient recovery method
   that performs well even at low 1-butanol concentrations is therefore
   necessary to ensure economic feasibility of the ABE fermentation
   process. In this work, configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in
   the Gibbs ensemble are performed to probe the adsorption of
   1-butanol/water solutions onto all-siliceous zeolites with the framework
   types MFI and FER At low solution concentration, the selectivity and
   capacity for 1-butanol in MFI are larger than those in FER, while the
   opposite is true for concentrations at or above those of ABE broths.
   Structural analysis at various loadings sheds light on the different
   sorbate sorbate and sorbate sorbent interactions that govern trends in
   adsorption in each zeolite.}},

Abstract = {{Present adoptive immunotherapy strategies are based on the re-targeting
   of autologous T-cells to recognize tumor antigens. As T-cell properties
   may vary significantly between patients, this approach can result in
   significant variability in cell potency that may affect therapeutic
   outcome. More consistent results could be achieved by generating
   allogeneic cells from healthy donors. An impediment to such an approach
   is the endogenous T-cell receptors present on T-cells, which have the
   potential to direct dangerous off-tumor anti host reactivity. To address
   these limitations, we assessed the ability of three different
   TCR-alpha-targeted nucleases to disrupt T-cell receptor expression in
   primary human T-cells. We optimized the conditions for the delivery of
   each reagent and assessed off-target cleavage. The megaTAL and
   CRISPR/Cas9 reagents exhibited the highest disruption efficiency
   combined with low levels of toxicity and off-target cleavage, and we
   used them for a translatable manufacturing process to produce safe
   cellular substrates for next-generation immunotherapies.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) provides a practical means of
   extracting insightful dynamical information from fluids datasets. Like
   any data processing technique, DMD's usefulness is limited by its
   ability to extract real and accurate dynamical features from
   noise-corrupted data. Here, we show analytically that DMD is biased to
   sensor noise, and quantify how this bias depends on the size and noise
   level of the data. We present three modifications to DMD that can be
   used to remove this bias: (1) a direct correction of the identified bias
   using known noise properties, (2) combining the results of performing
   DMD forwards and backwards in time, and (3) a total
   least-squares-inspired algorithm. We discuss the relative merits of each
   algorithm and demonstrate the performance of these modifications on a
   range of synthetic, numerical, and experimental datasets. We further
   compare our modified DMD algorithms with other variants proposed in the
   recent literature.}},

   rotating vertical axis wind turbine}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTS IN FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Three-dimensional, three-component mean velocity fields have been
   measured around and downstream of a scale model vertical axis wind
   turbine (VAWT) operated at tip speed ratios (TSRs) of 1.25 and 2.5, in
   addition to a non-rotating case. The five-bladed turbine model has an
   aspect ratio (height/diameter) of 1 and is operated in a water tunnel at
   a Reynolds number based on turbine diameter of 11,600. Velocity fields
   are acquired using magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) at an isotropic
   resolution of 1/50 of the turbine diameter. Mean flow reversal is
   observed immediately behind the turbine for cases with rotation. The
   turbine wake is highly three-dimensional and asymmetric throughout the
   investigated region, which extends up to 7 diameters downstream. A
   vortex pair, generated at the upwind-turning side of the turbine, plays
   a dominant role in wake dynamics by entraining faster fluid from the
   freestream and aiding in wake recovery. The higher TSR case shows a
   larger region of reverse flow and greater asymmetry in the near wake of
   the turbine, but faster wake recovery due to the increase in vortex pair
   strength with increasing TSR. The present measurement technique also
   provides detailed information about flow in the vicinity of the turbine
   blades and within the turbine rotor. The details of the flow field
   around VAWTs and in their wakes can inform the design of high-density
   VAWT wind farms, where wake interaction between turbines is a principal
   consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Freshwater faunal diversity and abundance have declined dramatically
   worldwide, concurrent with changes in streamflow and sediment loads in
   rivers. Cumulative effects and interdependencies of chronic co varying
   environmental stressors can obscure causal linkages that may be
   controlling the population dynamics of longer-lived freshwater fauna,
   such as mussels. To understand changes in long-term mussel population
   density, we developed a dynamic, process-based interaction model that
   couples streamflow, suspended sediment, phytoplankton, and mussel
   abundance under the hypothesis that chronic exposure to increased
   suspended sediment and food limitation are the primary factors
   controlling native mussel population density in a midwestern USA
   agricultural river basin. We calibrated and validated the model with
   extensive survey data from multiple time periods and used it to evaluate
   changes in mussel abundance at a subbasin scale over decades. We
   evaluated sensitivity of simulated mussel densities across a range of
   mortality rates and initial population densities. In scenarios
   representing altered sediment concentrations, such as might occur with
   climate or landuse-induced changes in streamflow or sediment generation
   rates, mussel population density showed critical threshold responses to
   long-term changes in suspended sediment concentration. This model of
   mussel population density can be used to test hypotheses about limiting
   factors, identify priority locations for restoration activities, and
   evaluate the effects of climate- or landuse-change scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{While the quest of end users for fast and convenient Internet services
   grows steadily, energy-hungry data centers correspondingly expand in
   both numbers and scale - a fact that raises global warming and climate
   change concerns. In addition, high penetration of renewables,
   development of energy-efficient cooling facilities, and flexibility of
   distributed storage units, all call for a system-wide energy and
   workload management policy for future sustainable data centers. As
   implementing offline management policies is practically infeasible due
   to complexity and the lack of future information, real-time management
   schemes are considered here under a systematic framework. Leveraging
   stochastic optimization tools, a unified management approach is proposed
   allowing data centers to adaptively respond to intermittent availability
   of renewables, variability of cooling efficiency, information technology
   (IT) workload shift, and energy price fluctuations under long-term
   quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. Meanwhile, it is rigorously
   established that when storage devices have sufficiently high capacity,
   or, the difference between electricity purchase and selling prices is
   small, the proposed algorithm yields a feasible and near-optimal
   management strategy without knowing the distributions of the
   independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) workload, renewable,
   and electricity price processes. Numerical results further demonstrate
   that the proposed algorithm works well not only for i.i.d. processes,
   but also in real-data scenarios, where the underlying randomness is
   highly correlated over time.}},

Title = {{The effect of inertia on the orientation dynamics of anisotropic
   particles in simple shear flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{791}},
Pages = {{631-703}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is well known that, under inertialess conditions, the orientation
   vector of a torque-free neutrally buoyant spheroid in an ambient simple
   shear flow rotates along so-called Jeffery orbits, a one-parameter
   family of closed orbits on the unit sphere centred around the direction
   of the ambient vorticity (Jeffery, Proc. R. Soc. Lond. A, vol. 102,
   1922, pp. 161-179). We characterize analytically the irreversible drift
   in the orientation of such torque free spheroidal particles of an
   arbitrary aspect ratio, across Jeffery orbits, that arises due to weak
   inertial effects. The analysis is valid in the limit Re. St << 1, where
   Re = ((gamma) over dotL(2)rho(f))/mu and St = ((gamma) over
   dotL(2)rho(f))IR are the Reynolds and Stokes numbers, which,
   respectively, measure the importance of fluid inertial forces and
   particle inertia in relation to viscous forces at the particle scale.
   Here. L is the setnimajor axis of the spheroid, rho(p) and rho(f) are
   the particle and fluid densities, (gamma) over dot is the ambient shear
   rate, and mu is the suspending fluid viscosity. A reciprocal theorem
   formulation is used to obtain the contributions to the drift due to
   particle and fluid inertia, the latter in terms of a volume integral
   over the entire fluid domain. The resulting drifts in orientation at
   O(Re) and O(St) are evaluated, as a function of the particle aspect
   ratio, for both prolate and oblate spheroids using a vector spheroidal
   harmonics formalism. It is found that particle inertia, at O(St), causes
   a prolate spheroid to drift towards an eventual tumbling motion in the
   flow-gradient plane. Oblate spheroids, on account of the O(St) drift,
   move in the opposite direction, approaching a steady spinning motion
   about the ambient\textbackslash{}tonicity axis. The period of rotation
   in the spinning mode must remain unaltered to all orders in St. For the
   tumbling mode, the period remains unaltered at O(St). At O(St(2)),
   however, particle inertia speeds up the rotation of prolate spheroids.
   The O(Re) drift due to fluid inertia drives a prolate spheroid towards a
   tumbling motion in the flow-gradient plane for all initial orientations
   and for all aspect ratios. Interestingly, for oblate spheroids, there is
   a bifurcation in the orientation dynamics at a critical aspect ratio of
   approximately 0.14. Oblate spheroids with aspect ratios greater than
   this critical value drift in a direction opposite to that for prolate
   spheroids, and eventually approach a spinning spirnling motionabout the
   ambient\textbackslash{}tonicity axis starting from any initial
   orientation. For smaller aspect ratios, a pair of non-trivial repelling
   orbits emerge from the flow-gradient plane, and divide the unit sphere
   into distinct basins of orientations that asymptote to the tumbling and
   spinning modes. With further decrease in the aspect ratio, these
   repellers move away from the flow-gradient plane, eventually coalescing
   onto an arc of the great circle in which the gradient-vorticity plane
   intersects the unit sphere, in the limit of a vanishing aspect ratio.
   Thus, sufficiently thin oblate spheroids, similar to prolate spheroids,
   drift towards an eventual tumbling motion irrespective of their initial
   orientation. The drifts at O(St) and at O(Re) are combined to obtain the
   drift for a neutrally buoyant spheroid. The particle inertia
   contribution remains much smaller than the fluid inertia contribution
   for most aspect ratios and density ratios of order unity.
   As a result, the critical aspect ratio for the bifurcation in the
   orientation dynamics of neutrally buoyant oblate spheroids changes only
   slightly from its value based only on fluid inertia. The existence of
   Jeffery orbits implies a rheological indeterminacy, and the dependence
   of the suspension shear viscosity on initial conditions. For prolate
   spheroids and oblate spheroids of aspect ratio greater than 0.14,
   inclusion of inertia resolves the indeterminacy Remarkably, the
   existence of the above bifurcation implies that, for a dilute suspension
   of oblate spheroids with aspect ratios smaller than 0.14, weak
   stochastic fluctuations (residual Brownian motion being analysed here as
   an example) play a crucial role in obtaining a shear viscosity
   independent of the initial orientation distribution. The inclusion of
   Brownian motion leads to a new smaller critical aspect ratio of
   approximately 0.013. For sufficiently large Re Pe(r), the peak in the
   steady-state orientation distribution shifts rapidly from the spinning-
   to the tumbling-mode location as the spheroid aspect ratio decreases
   below this critical value; here, Pe(r) = (gamma) over dot/D-r, with D-r
   being the Brownian rotary diffusivity, so that Re Pe(r) measures the
   relative importance of inertial drift and Brownian rotary diffusion. The
   shear viscosity, plotted as a function of Re Pe(r), exhibits a sharp
   transition from a shear-thickening to a shear-thinning behaviour, as the
   oblate spheroid aspect ratio decreases below 0.013. Our results are
   compared in detail to earlier analytical work for limiting cases
   involving either nearly spherical particles or slender fibres with weak
   inertia, and to the results of recent numerical simulations at larger
   values of Re and St.}},

Abstract = {{To fully deploy the potential of semiconductor nanocrystal films as

   theoretically derive the critical concentration n(c) for films of
   heavily doped nanocrystals devoid of ligands at their surface and in
   direct contact with each other. In the accompanying experiments, we
   investigate the conduction mechanism in films of phosphorus-doped,
   ligand-free silicon nanocrystals. At the largest electron concentration
   achieved in our samples, which is half the predicted n(c), we find that
   the localization length of hopping electrons is close to three times the
   nanocrystals diameter, indicating that the film approaches the

Abstract = {{The purpose of this research is to identify correlates of bike station
   activity for Nice Ride Minnesota, a bike share system in the
   Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area in Minnesota. The number of trips
   to and from each of the 116 bike share stations operating in 2011 was
   obtained from Nice Ride Minnesota. Data for independent variables
   included in the proposed models come from a variety of sources,
   including the 2010 U.S. Census; the Metropolitan Council, a regional
   planning agency; and the Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. Log-linear
   and negative binomial regression models are used to evaluate the
   marginal effects of these factors on average daily station trips. The
   models have high goodness of fit, and each of 13 independent variables
   is significant at the 10\% level or higher. The number of trips at Nice
   Ride stations is associated with neighborhood sociodemographics (i.e.,
   age and race), proximity to the central business district, proximity to
   water, accessibility to trails, distance to other bike share stations,
   and measures of economic activity. Analysts can use these results to
   optimize bike share operations, locate new stations, and evaluate the
   potential of new bike share programs. (C) 2015 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Development of rational vectors for efficient drug and gene delivery is
   crucial for cancer treatment. In this study, epidermal growth factor
   receptor (EGFR)-binding peptide amphiphile (PA) were used as the primary
   bilayer skeleton material to construct ultra-stable self-assembling
   peptide nanovesicle (SPV). The resulted EGFR-targeted SPV (ESPV) could
   efficiently encapsulate therapeutic cargos (drugs or small interfering
   RNAs {[}siRNAs]) or labelled fluorescent cargo (quantum dots {[}QDs])
   and exhibited excellent affinity for EGFR-positive cancer cells.
   Moreover, ESPV could deliver more drug or plasmid DNA to tumour sites
   and promote gene expression (a three-fold ratio of ESPVs vs cationic
   liposomes). Notably, the individual delivery or co-delivery of
   doxorubicin (DOX) and the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) gene via the ESPVs
   resulted in excellent drug/gene delivery both in vitro and in vivo and
   exerted a significant growth-suppressing effect on a liver cancer
   xenograft. This nanoscale, targeted cargo-packaging technology may
   provide a new strategy for the design of highly targeted cancer therapy
   vectors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{55-64}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Intermittent cyclic stretching and incrementally increasing strain
   amplitude cyclic stretching were explored to overcome the reported
   adaptation of fibroblasts in response to constant amplitude cyclic
   stretching, with the goals of accelerating collagen production and
   understanding the underlying cell signaling. The effects of constant
   amplitude, intermittent, and incremental cyclic stretching regimens were
   investigated for dermal fibroblasts entrapped in a fibrin gel by
   monitoring the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) and p38
   pathways, collagen transcription, and finally the deposited collagen
   protein. Activation of ERK1/2, which has been shown to be necessary for
   stretch-induced collagen transcription, was maximal at 15 min and
   decayed by 1 h. ERK1/2 was reactivated by an additional onset of
   stretching or by an increment in the strain amplitude 6 h after the
   initial stimulus, which was approximately the lifetime of activated p38,
   a known ERK1/2 inhibitor. While both intermittent and incremental
   regimens reactivated ERK1/2, only incremental stretching increased
   collagen production compared to samples stretched with constant
   amplitude, resulting in a 37\% increase in collagen per cell after 2
   weeks. This suggests that a regimen with small, frequent increments in
   strain amplitude is optimal for this system and should be used in
   bioreactors for engineered tissues requiring high collagen content.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{83}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{We construct an energy-based model to study crack growth behavior in a

   elastic energy of the specimen and loading device, the surface energy of
   the crack, and the energy associated with transforming austenite to
   martensite, depends on the applied extension, the crack length, and the
   martensite volume fraction. The crack length and martensite volume
   fraction are coupled through a transformation criteria at the crack tip.
   By tracking the progression of equilibrium cracks as extension
   increases, we show that the transformation leads to a regime of stable
   crack growth followed by unstable growth. These results are in agreement
   with experiments on both single crystal and polycrystal shape-memory
   alloys.}},

Title = {{Numerical investigation of near-wake characteristics of cavitating flow
   over a circular cylinder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{790}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A homogeneous mixture model is used to study cavitation over a circular
   cylinder at two different Reynolds numbers (Re = 200 and 3900) and four
   different cavitation numbers (sigma = 2.0, 1.0, 0.7 and 0.5). It is
   observed that the simulated cases fall into two different cavitation
   regimes: cyclic and transitional. Cavitation is seen to significantly
   influence the evolution of pressure, boundary layer and loads on the
   cylinder surface. The cavitated shear layer rolls up into vortices,
   which are then shed from the cylinder, similar to a single-phase flow.
   However, the Strouhal number corresponding to vortex shedding decreases
   as the flow cavitates, and vorticity dilatation is found to play an
   important role in this reduction. At lower cavitation numbers, the
   entire vapour cavity detaches from the cylinder, leaving the wake
   cavitation-free for a small period of time. This low-frequency cavity
   detachment is found to occur due to a propagating condensation front and
   is discussed in detail. The effect of initial void fraction is assessed.
   The speed of sound in the free stream is altered as a result and the
   associated changes in the wake characteristics are discussed in detail.
   Finally, a large-eddy simulation of cavitating flow at Re = 3900 and
   sigma = 1.0 is studied and a higher wan cavity length is obtained when
   compared to the cavitating flow at Re 200 and sigma = 1.0. The wake
   characteristics are compared to the single-phase results at the same
   Reynolds number and it is observed that cavitation suppresses turbulence
   in the near wake and delays three-dimensional breakdown of the vortices.}},

   change along the shear layer for R = 4. MID of the full
   three-dimensional flow field is able to reproduce the dominant
   frequencies observed from DNS and shows that the shear layer modes are
   dominant for both the conditions simulated. The spatial modes obtained
   from DMD are used to study the nature of the shear layer instability. It
   is found that a counter-current mixing layer is obtained in the upstream
   shear layer. The corresponding mixing velocity ratio is obtained, and
   seen to delineate the two regimes of absolute or convective instability.
   The effect of the nozzle is evaluated by performing simulations without
   the nozzle while requiring the jet to have the same inlet velocity
   profile as that obtained at the nozzle exit in the simulations including
   the nozzle. The shear layer spectra show good agreement with the
   simulations including the nozzle. The effect of shear layer thickness is
   studied at a velocity ratio of 2 based on peak and mean jet velocity.
   The dominant frequencies and spatial shear layer modes from DNS/DMD are
   significantly altered by the jet exit velocity profile.}},

Abstract = {{This study used life cycle assessment and technical economic analysis
   tools in evaluating a novel Scum-to-Biodiesel technology and compares
   the technology with scum digestion and combustion processes. The key
   variables that control environmental and economic performance are
   identified and discussed. The results show that all impacts examined for
   the Scum-to-Biodiesel technology are below zero indicating significant
   environmental benefits could be drawn from it. Of the three technologies
   examined, the Scum-to-Biodiesel technology has the best environmental
   performance in fossil fuel depletion, GHG emissions, and eutrophication,
   whereas combustion has the best performance on acidification. Of all
   process inputs assessed, process heat, glycerol, and methanol uses had
   the highest impacts, much more than any other inputs considered. The
   Scum-to-Biodiesel technology also makes higher revenue than other
   technologies. The diesel price is a key variable for its economic
   performance. The research demonstrates the feasibility and benefits in
   developing Scum-to-Biodiesel technology in wastewater treatment

Abstract = {{Industrial application of encapsulated bacteria for biodegradation of
   hydrocarbons in water requires mechanically stable materials. A silica
   gel encapsulation method was optimized for Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4,
   a bacterium that degrades more than 100 aromatic hydrocarbons. The
   design process focused on three aspects: (i) mechanical property
   enhancement; (ii) gel cytocompatibility; and (iii) reduction of the
   diffusion barrier in the gel. Mechanical testing indicated that the
   compressive strength at failure (sigma(f)) and elastic modulus (E)
   changed linearly with the amount of silicon alkoxide used in the gel
   composition. Measurement of naphthalene biodegradation by encapsulated
   cells indicated that the gel maintained cytocompatibility at lower
   levels of alkoxide. However, significant loss in activity was observed
   due to methanol formation during hydrolysis at high alkoxide
   concentrations, as measured by FTIR spectroscopy. The silica gel with
   the highest amount of alkoxide (without toxicity from methanol) had a
   biodegradation rate of 285 +/- 42nmol/L-s, sigma(f)=652 +/- 88kPa, and
   E=15.8 +/- 2.0MPa. Biodegradation was sustained for 1 month before it
   dropped below 20\% of the initial rate. In order to improve the
   diffusion through the gel, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) was used as a porogen
   and resulted in a 48 +/- 19\% enhancement in biodegradation, but it
   impacted the mechanical properties negatively. This is the first report
   studying how the silica composition affects biodegradation of
   naphthalene by Pseudomonas sp. NCIB 9816-4 and establishes a foundation
   for future studies of aromatic hydrocarbon biodegradation for industrial
   application. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016;113: 513-521. (c) 2015 Wiley

Abstract = {{An advanced air cooling scheme that combines both active and passive
   cooling components is proposed and its thermal performance is
   demonstrated with single channel heat transfer experiments. The active
   cooling component, a piezoelectric translational agitator, generates
   strong air turbulence using a blade oscillating at a high frequency near
   either plain or micro pin-fin surfaces in the channel. The translational
   agitation of the blade is realized using an oval loop shell amplifier
   with a piezoelectric stack actuator. The micro pin-fin surfaces were
   fabricated by the LIGA photolithography technique. Single channel heat
   transfer experiments show promising results in the combined system with
   the micro pin-fin surface and the agitator. For instance, the combined
   system heat transfer coefficients were 250\% of those on smooth surfaces
   without agitation. The channel flow rate was 40 LPM and the Reynolds
   number was 3300. Measurements are presented that assess, pin fin and
   agitation effects on thermal performance of the proposed active heat
   sink system for several channel flow rates. Based on these single
   channel test results, a multi-channel, full-size, active heat sink
   system utilizing micro pin fins and translational agitators is proposed,
   and its thermal performance is estimated. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Although endothelial cells (ECs) have been derived from human
   pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), large-scale generation of hPSC-ECs
   remains challenging and their functions are not well characterized. Here
   we report a simple and efficient three-stage method that allows
   generation of approximately 98 and 9500 ECs on day 16 and day 34,
   respectively, from each human embryonic stem cell (hESC) input. The
   functional properties of hESC-ECs derived in the presence and absence of
   a TGF-inhibitory molecule SB431542 were characterized and compared with
   those of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Confluent
   monolayers formed by SB431542 (+) hESC-ECs, SB431542(-)hESC-ECs, and
   HUVECs showed similar permeability to 10,000 Da dextran, but these cells
   exhibited striking differences in forming tube-like structures in 3D
   fibrin gels. The SB431542 (+) hESC-ECs were most potent in forming
   tube-like structures regardless of whether VEGF and bFGF were present in
   the medium; less potent SB431542(-)hESC-ECs and HUVECs responded
   differently to VEGF and bFGF, which significantly enhanced the ability
   of HUVECs to form tube-like structures but had little impact on
   SB431542(-)hESC-ECs. This study offers an efficient approach to
   large-scale hPSC-EC production and suggests that the phenotypes and
   functions of hPSC-ECs derived under different conditions need to be
   thoroughly examined before their use in technology development. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{We consider a classical derivation of a continuum theory, based on the
   fundamental balance laws of mass and momenta, for a body with internal
   corner and surface contact interactions. The balances of mass and linear
   and angular momentum are applied to the arbitrary parts of a continuum
   which supports non-classical internal corner and surface contact
   interactions. The form of the specific corner contact interaction force
   measured per unit length of the corner is derived. A generalized form of
   Cauchy's stress theorem is obtained, which shows that the surface
   traction on an oriented surface depends in a specific way on both the
   oriented unit normal as well as the curvature of the surface. An
   explicit form of the surface-couple traction which acts on every
   oriented surface is obtained. Two fields in the continuum, which are
   denoted as stress and hyperstress fields, are shown to exist, and their
   role in representing the surface traction and the surface-couple
   traction is identified. Finally, the field equations for this theory are
   determined, and a fundamental power theorem is derived. In the absence
   of internal corner and surface-couple traction interactions, the
   equations of classical continuum mechanics are recovered. There is no
   appeal to any `principle of virtual power' in this work.}},

Abstract = {{The size, composition, and crystallinity of plasma produced
   nanoparticles are crucial factors for their physical and chemical
   properties. Here, we investigate the role of the process gas
   composition, particularly the hydrogen (H-2) flow rate, on germanium
   (Ge) nanoparticles synthesized from a chlorinated precursor by
   nonthermal plasma. We demonstrate that the gas composition can
   significantly change the nanoparticle size and also adjust the surface
   chemistry by altering the dominant reaction mechanisms. A red shift of
   the Ge-Cl-x infrared absorptions with increasing H-2 flow indicates a
   weakening of the Ge-Cl-x bonds at high H-2 content. Furthermore, by
   changing the gas composition, the nanoparticles microstructure can be
   controlled from mostly amorphous at high hydrogen flow to diamond cubic
   crystalline at low hydrogen flow. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{A mathematical model of tumor growth and its response to single
   irradiation}},
Journal = {{THEORETICAL BIOLOGY AND MEDICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{FEB 27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Mathematical modeling of biological processes is widely used
   to enhance quantitative understanding of bio-medical phenomena. This
   quantitative knowledge can be applied in both clinical and experimental
   settings. Recently, many investigators began studying mathematical
   models of tumor response to radiation therapy. We developed a simple
   mathematical model to simulate the growth of tumor volume and its
   response to a single fraction of high dose irradiation. The modelling
   study may provide clinicians important insights on radiation therapy
   strategies through identification of biological factors significantly
   influencing the treatment effectiveness.
   Methods: We made several key assumptions of the model. Tumor volume is
   composed of proliferating (or dividing) cancer cells and non-dividing
   (or dead) cells. Tumor growth rate (or tumor volume doubling time) is
   proportional to the ratio of the volumes of tumor vasculature and the
   tumor. The vascular volume grows slower than the tumor by introducing
   the vascular growth retardation factor, theta. Upon irradiation, the
   proliferating cells gradually die over a fixed time period after
   irradiation. Dead cells are cleared away with cell clearance time. The
   model was applied to simulate pre-treatment growth and post-treatment
   radiation response of rat rhabdomyosarcoma tumors and metastatic brain
   tumors of five patients who were treated with Gamma Knife stereotactic
   radiosurgery (GKSRS).
   Results: By selecting appropriate model parameters, we showed the
   temporal variation of the tumors for both the rat experiment and the
   clinical GKSRS cases could be easily replicated by the simple model.
   Additionally, the application of our model to the GKSRS cases showed
   that the a-value, which is an indicator of radiation sensitivity in the
   LQ model, and the value of theta could be predictors of the
   post-treatment volume change.
   Conclusions: The proposed model was successful in representing both the
   animal experimental data and the clinically observed tumor volume
   changes. We showed that the model can be used to find the potential
   biological parameters, which may be able to predict the treatment
   outcome. However, there is a large statistical uncertainty of the result
   due to the small sample size. Therefore, a future clinical study with a
   larger number of patients is needed to confirm the finding.}},

Title = {{A Micro-Thermal Sensor for Focal Therapy Applications}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 26}},
Abstract = {{There is an urgent need for sensors deployed during focal therapies to
   inform treatment planning and in vivo monitoring in thin tissues.
   Specifically, the measurement of thermal properties, cooling surface
   contact, tissue thickness, blood flow and phase change with mm to sub mm
   accuracy are needed. As a proof of principle, we demonstrate that a
   micro-thermal sensor based on the supported ``3 omega{''} technique can
   achieve this in vitro under idealized conditions in 0.5 to 2 mm thick
   tissues relevant to cryoablation of the pulmonary vein (PV). To begin
   with ``3 omega.{''} sensors were microfabricated onto flat glass as an
   idealization of a focal probe surface. The sensor was then used to make
   new measurements of `k' (W/m.K) of porcine PV, esophagus, and phrenic
   nerve, all needed for PV cryoabalation treatment planning. Further, by
   modifying the sensor use from traditional to dynamic mode new
   measurements related to tissue vs. fluid (i.e. water) contact, fluid
   flow conditions, tissue thickness, and phase change were made. In
   summary, the in vitro idealized system data presented is promising and
   warrants future work to integrate and test supported ``3 omega{''}
   sensors on in vivo deployed focal therapy probe surfaces (i.e. balloons
   or catheters).}},

Abstract = {{The exchange of copolymer chains between 1 vol \% PS-PEP
   (poly(styrene-b-ethylene-alt-propylene)) di-block copolymer micelles in
   squalane (selective for PEP) is investigated using time-resolved
   small-angle neutron scattering (TR-SANS) as a function of added PEP
   homopolymer. The solvent squalane, C30H62, is substituted in part or
   completely with PEP homopolymers that are the same molecular weight as
   the corona blocks. Polymer solutions/mixtures (1 vol \% PS-PEP, plus 2,
   7, or 15 vol \% PEP in squalane, and 1 vol \% PS-PEP in PEP) were
   separately prepared using normal (h-PS) or deuterated equivalent (d-PS)
   PS-PEP diblock copolymers. The solvent was contrast matched to a 50/50
   mixed h-/d-PS micelle core, so that the scattering intensity decays with
   the mixing of h- and d-PS-PEP chains undergoing exchange between
   micelles. The chain exchange rate can therefore be assessed
   quantitatively. As the concentration of added homopolymer in solution
   increases above the overlap concentration of PEP chains, the chain
   exchange rate drops significantly. The results are compared to an
   earlier study of chain exchange between PS-PEP micelles in a 15\%
   solution in squalane, which was also found to be significantly slower
   than when the solution is dilute. The primary factor in this slowing
   down of chain exchange is an increased screening of excluded volume
   interactions among the corona blocks. The role of increasing micelle
   aggregation number with PEP concentration is found not to be the
   dominant effect up to 15\% added PEP but may play an increasingly
   important role in the PEP melt matrix, where no chain exchange could be
   detected in these experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We investigated a hierarchical morphology change and accompanying sol

   (PPhEt-MA), as the end blocks and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as
   the middle block (PBnMA-b-PMMA-b-PPhEtMA: BMP). BMP undergoes a
   hierarchical phase transition corresponding to the self assembly of each
   of the thermosensitive blocks in the IL, and a sol gel transition was
   observed in concentrated, above 10 wt \%, polymer solutions. The
   gelation behavior was affected by polymer concentration, and at 20 wt
   \%, the BMP/IL composite showed a phase transition, with increasing
   temperature, from solution through a jammed micelle suspension to a
   physically cross-linked gel. Each phase was formed reversibly and
   rapidly over the corresponding temperature range. The jammed micelle and
   cross-linked gel states were characterized using viscoelastic

Abstract = {{Air-cathode microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are widely tested to recover
   electrical energy from waste streams containing organic matter. When
   high-strength wastewater, such as liquid animal manure, is used as a
   medium, inhibition on anode and cathode catalysts potentially impairs
   the effectiveness of MFC performance in power generation and pollutant
   removal. This study evaluated possible inhibitive effects of liquid
   swine manure components on MFC power generation, improved liquid
   manure-fed MFCs performance by pretreatment (dilution and selective
   adsorption), and modeled the kinetics of organic matter and nutrients
   removal kinetics. Parameters monitored included pH, conductivity,
   chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile fatty acids (VFAs), total
   ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), nitrite, nitrate, and phosphate
   concentrations. The removals of VFA and TAN were efficient, indicated by
   the short half-life times of 4.99 and 7.84 d, respectively. The
   mechanism for phosphate decrease was principally the salt precipitation
   on cathode, but the removal was incomplete after 42-d operation. MFC

   generated relatively small power (28.2 W), energy efficiency (0.37\%)
   and Coulombic efficiency (1.5\%). Dilution of swine wastewater
   dramatically improved the power generation as the inhibitory effect was
   decreased. Zeolite and granular activated carbon were effective in the
   selective adsorption of ammonia or organic matter in swine wastewater,
   and so substantially improved the power generation, energy efficiency,
   and Coulombic efficiency. A smaller external resistor in the circuit was
   also observed to promote the organic matter degradation and thus to
   shorten the treatment time. Overall, air-cathode MFCs are promising for
   generating electrical power from livestock wastewater and meanwhile
   reducing the level of organic matter and nutrients.}},

Title = {{Spatial/temporal photocurrent and electronic transport in monolayer
   molybdenum disulfide grown by chemical vapor deposition}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{108}},

Month = {{FEB 22}},
Abstract = {{We systematically investigate the spatial/temporal photocurrent in
   photodetectors and electronic transport in transistors/Hall-bar devices
   based on monolayer MoS2 grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). We
   found that the maximum photocurrent occurs when the laser spot is close
   to the metal/MoS2 contact and is tunable by the applied drain voltage,
   which can be explained by the modulation of the local electric field at
   the Schottky barrier, consistent with predictions from our quantum
   transport simulation. We observed that the maximum photocurrent at drain
   contact is much larger than the one at the source contact, and the DC
   currents show rectifying behavior. These phenomena can be explained by
   the different Schottky barrier heights at the two contacts. By measuring
   Hall-bar structure at various temperatures from 100K to 400 K, we
   extracted the barrier heights at the source and drain contacts,
   separately. We found that the barrier height at drain contact is about
   50mV larger than the one at the source contact, consistent with the
   photocurrent and DC current observations. We measured the photocurrent
   at various powers, and a photoresponsivity of 3.07mA/W was extracted at
   low powers. When the power increases above 20 mu W, the photocurrent
   starts to saturate. Temporal response of the photocurrent is also
   dependent on the laser power. At high laser powers, photocurrent
   overshoot was observed. The photocurrent saturation at high powers and
   the overshoot in temporal photocurrent are likely due to the same
   mechanism: an accumulation of electrons in the channel, flattening out
   the band structure, since the laser spot is located near the drain
   contact in these measurements. These studies of photocurrents and
   electronic transport in CVD MoS2 highlight the importance of the
   contacts in the electronic/optoelectronic devices and reveal the
   physical mechanism of the photocurrent/electronic transport in these
   devices. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass to bio-oils by thermochemical
   pyrolysis is a promising reactor technology for renewable chemicals and
   biofuels. Although the fundamental understanding of relevant catalysts
   within reacting biomass particles is only in its infancy, it is known
   that inorganic materials naturally present within biomass act as
   catalysts that limit the yield of bio-oil and alter the product
   distribution. In this work, the effect of alkaline earth metals on
   cellulose pyrolysis chemistry was investigated to determine the
   catalytic effect on primary (transport-free) and secondary
   (diffusion-limited) reaction pathways. The catalytic materials included
   homogeneous metal ions Ca2+ and Mg2+ from their inorganic salts,
   Ca(NO3)(2) and Mg(NO3)(2), and their corresponding heterogeneous metal
   oxides, CaO and MgO. Although the oxides had a limited impact on
   cellulose pyrolysis chemistry, the metal ions altered the secondary
   reaction pathways of cellulose significantly under diffusion-limited
   conditions common to lignocellulosic particles within industrial
   reactors.}},

Abstract = {{Atmospheric aerosol acidity is an important characteristic of aqueous
   particles, which has been linked to the formation of secondary organic
   aerosol by catalyzing reactions of oxidized organic compounds that have
   partitioned to the particle phase. However, aerosol acidity is difficult
   to measure and traditionally estimated using indirect methods or
   assumptions based on composition. Ongoing disagreements between
   experiments and thermodynamic models of particle acidity necessitate
   improved fundamental understanding of pH and ion behavior in high ionic
   strength atmospheric particles. Herein, Raman microspectroscopy was used
   to determine the pH of individual particles (H2SO4+MgSO4) based on
   sulfate and bisulfate concentrations determined from nu(s)(SO42-) and
   nu(s)(HSO4-), the acid dissociation constant, and activity coefficients
   from extended DebyeHuckel calculations. Shifts in pH and peak positions
   of nu(s)(SO42-) and nu(s)(HSO4-) were observed as a function of relative
   humidity. These results indicate the potential for direct spectroscopic
   determination of pH in individual particles and the need to improve
   fundamental understanding of ion behavior in atmospheric particles.}},

Abstract = {{Bioelectronic interfaces require electrodes that are mechanically
   flexible and chemically inert. Flexibility allows pristine electrode
   contact to skin and tissue, and chemical inertness prevents electrodes
   from reacting with biological fluids and living tissues. Therefore,
   flexible gold electrodes are ideal for bioimpedance and biopotential
   measurements such as bioimpedance tomography, electrocardiography (ECG),
   electroencephalography (EEG), and electromyography (EMG). However, a
   manufacturing process to fabricate gold electrode arrays on plastic
   substrates is still elusive. In this work, a fabrication and
   low-temperature sintering (similar to 200 degrees C) technique is
   demonstrated to fabricate gold electrodes. At low-temperature sintering
   conditions, lines of different widths demonstrate different sintering
   speeds. Therefore, the sintering condition is targeted toward the widest
   feature in the design layout. Manufactured electrodes show minimum
   feature size of 62 mu m and conductivity values of 5 x 10(6) S m(-1).
   Utilizing the versatility of printing and plastic electronic processes,
   electrode arrays consisting of 31 electrodes with electrode-to-electrode
   spacing ranging from 2 to 7 mm are fabricated and used for impedance
   mapping of conformal surfaces at 15 kHz. Overall, the fabrication
   process of an inkjet-printed gold electrode array that is electrically
   reproducible, mechanically robust, and promising for bioimpedance and
   biopotential measurements is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{The optical properties, composition and sources of the wintertime
   aerosols in the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) were characterized through
   measurements made in Fresno, CA during the 2013 DISCOVER-AQ campaign.
   PM2.5 extinction and absorption coefficients were measured at 405, 532,
   and 870 nm along with refractory black carbon (rBC) size distributions
   and concentrations. BC absorption enhancements (E-abs) were measured
   using two methods, a thermodenuder and mass absorption coefficient
   method, which agreed well. Relatively large diurnal variations in the
   E-abs at 405 nm were observed, likely reflecting substantial nighttime
   emissions of wood burning organic aerosols (OA) from local residential
   heating. Comparably small diurnal variations and absolute nighttime
   values of E-abs were observed at the other wavelengths, suggesting
   limited mixing-driven enhancement. Positive matrix factorization
   analysis of OA mass spectra from an aerosol mass spectrometer resolved
   two types of biomass burning OA, which appeared to have different
   chemical composition and absorptivity. Brown carbon (BrC) absorption was
   estimated to contribute up to 30\% to the total absorption at 405 nm at
   night but was negligible (<10\%) during the day. Quantitative
   understanding of retrieved BrC optical properties could be improved with
   more explicit knowledge of the BC mixing state and the distribution of
   coating thicknesses.}},

Title = {{Diffusion of Ellipsoids in Bacterial Suspensions}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{116}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 10}},
Abstract = {{Active fluids such as swarming bacteria and motile colloids exhibit
   exotic properties different from conventional equilibrium materials. As
   a peculiar example, a spherical tracer immersed inside active fluids
   shows an enhanced translational diffusion, orders of magnitude stronger
   than its intrinsic Brownian motion. Here, rather than spherical tracers,
   we investigate the diffusion of isolated ellipsoids in a
   quasi-two-dimensional bacterial bath. Our study shows a nonlinear
   enhancement of both translational and rotational diffusions of
   ellipsoids. More importantly, we uncover an anomalous coupling between
   particles' translation and rotation that is strictly prohibited in
   Brownian diffusion. The coupling reveals a counterintuitive anisotropic
   particle diffusion, where an ellipsoid diffuses fastest along its minor
   axis in its body frame. Combining experiments with theoretical modeling,
   we show that such an anomalous diffusive behavior arises from the
   generic straining flow of swimming bacteria. Our work illustrates an
   unexpected feature of active fluids and deepens our understanding of
   transport processes in microbiological systems.}},

Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{321}},

Abstract = {{Corn (Zea mays L) residues and perennial C-4 grasses are two Midwest
   bioenergy feedstock candidates due to their compatibility with
   agricultural infrastructure and potential for ecosystem service
   delivery. We validated the ecosystem process model AGRO-BGC by comparing
   model estimates with empirical observations from corn and perennial C-4
   grass systems across Wisconsin and Illinois under no -tillage, nitrogen
   fertilized, and unfertilized management. Validation parameters included
   soil organic carbon (SOC), total soil nitrogen (N) to 1.2 m, aboveground
   net primary productivity (ANPP), net ecosystem productivity (NEP), and
   leaf area index (LAI). We parameterized AGRO-BGC to represent
   ecophysiological characteristics of corn and perennial prairie grasses,
   and constructed scenarios to represent corresponding edaphic, climate,
   and management conditions. Unfertilized annual model estimates had
   normalized mean average errors relative to field measurements of 0.3,
   23, and 4 t ha(-1) for ANPP, SOC, and N, respectively. Fertilized
   simulations erred from observations by 0.6, 29, 5 t ha(-1) for ANPP,
   SOC, and N, respectively.
   We also estimated long-term implications of varying residue removal
   rates on SOC. Model estimates compared to field data tested the
   hypothesis that long-term increased residue removal decreases SOC. Field
   observations showed 0.17, 0.09, and a -0.17 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) change for
   control, harvest, and bare grass residue removal treatments,
   respectively. Simulated SOC loss was greatest for the most intensive
   residue removal scenarios (-0.48 and -0.68 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) for corn
   and grass, respectively), compared to no-harvest scenarios that
   increased SOC by 0.05 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) for both corn and grass.
   AGRO-BGC estimated a 0.07 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) loss under corn residue
   harvest, while estimating 0.09 t C ha(-1) yr(-1) loss for grass. Results
   suggest long-term increased corn and grass residue harvest (beyond
   grain) for biofuel feedstock will decrease SOC and soil productivity by
   approximately 15\% in corn and 21\% in grass systems over 47 years. (C)

Abstract = {{Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are promising devices for high capacity,
   rechargeable electrical energy storage; however, LIBs are currently
   limited by the low specific capacity of the cathode compared to the
   anode. In previous work, our group demonstrated the viability of a novel
   cathode material, LisZrO(6) (LZO), through computational and
   experimental results. Here we report a general synthesis for transition
   metal-doped LZO, and we study the effects of doping on electrochemical
   delithiation and relithiation. A synthesis using transition-metal (M)
   doped ZrO2 nanoparticle/carbon black composites as precursors produces
   doped M-LZO with grain sizes between 35 and 67 nm. The materials were
   tested as electrode materials. Specific capacities of the doped
   materials depend on the transition metal and on the Li:Zr ratio used in
   the synthesis, but they are generally higher than in similarly prepared
   undoped LZO. In this set of cathode materials, Fe3+-doped LZO/C
   composites showed the highest specific capacities, with an initial
   discharge capacity higher than two Li ions per formula unit, a specific
   capacity of 175 mAh/g maintained after 140 cycles, and a specific
   capacity greater than 80 mAh/g at a rate of 5C. The effects of doping
   were also investigated by density functional calculations of dopant
   locations, band gaps, and delithiation energies. We found that all of
   the dopants that we studied are more favorably located in Li ion sites
   than in Zr ion sites. The calculated doping effects on structural
   parameters agree well with experiments. We also found that doping with
   any of these ions leads to smaller band gaps. Electronic structure
   calculations with the HSE06 exchange-correlation functional show that
   deintercalation after doping with Ce3+, Cu2+, or Co2+ at a Li site
   decreases the attainable cell voltage, whereas Fe3+ doping at a Li site
   increases it. Because of the large polarization and high carbon content
   of the M-LZO/C composite electrodes, further materials optimization will
   be needed before they become practical for LIBs.}},

Abstract = {{We compare two theories for backfolding of semiflexible polymers, such
   as DNA, confined in circular tubes of diameter of the order of the
   persistence length of the macromolecule. The first theory was proposed
   by Odijk on the basis of a one-dimensional analogue of Flory theory, and
   the second theory is a cooperativity model of deflection segments and
   S-loops suggested by Dai et al. By performing Monte Carlo chain growth
   simulations of long chains, we find that Odijk's scaling theory not only
   captures the contour length dependence of extension of the confined
   chain but also correctly predicts its asymptotic value. In contrast, the
   cooperativity model appears to quantify the extension only for the
   contour lengths that were used to parametrize the model and
   systematically deviates from the simulation data as the contour length
   increases.}},

Month = {{FEB 6}},
Abstract = {{The importance of tissue remodelling is widely accepted, but the
   mechanism by which the remodelling process occurs remains poorly
   understood. At the tissue scale, the concept of tensional homeostasis,
   in which there exists a target stress for a cell and remodelling
   functions to move the cell stress towards that target, is an important
   foundation for much theoretical work. We present here a theoretical
   model of a cell in parallel with a network to study what factors of the
   remodelling process help the cell move towards mechanical stability. The
   cell-network system was deformed and kept at constant stress.
   Remodelling was modelled by simulating strain-dependent degradation of
   collagen fibres and four different cases of collagen addition. The model
   did not lead to complete tensional homeostasis in the range of
   conditions studied, but it showed how different expressions for
   deposition and removal of collagen in a fibre network can interact to
   modulate the cell's ability to shield itself from an imposed stress by
   remodelling the surroundings. This study also showed how delicate the
   balance between deposition and removal rates is and how sensitive the
   remodelling process is to small changes in the remodelling rules.}},

   modulation}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{FEB 5}},
Abstract = {{Cell fusion can occur between mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) transplanted
   to improve cardiac function and cells of the recipient. The therapeutic
   benefit or detriment of resultant cell hybrids is unknown. Here we
   augment fusion of transplanted MSCs with recipient cardiac cell types
   via viral fusogens to determine how cardiac function is impacted. Using
   a Cre/LoxP-based luciferase reporter system coupled to biophotonic
   imaging and echocardiography, we found that augmenting fusion with the
   vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) increased the amount of
   fusion in the recipient mouse heart, but led to diminished cardiac
   function. Specifically, MSCs transfected with VSVG (MSC-VSVG) had the
   lowest mean fold increase in fractional area change (FAC) and cardiac
   output (CO). Although the amount of fusion detected had a strong
   positive correlation (Pearson) with fractional area change and cardiac
   output at day 7, this effect was lost by day 28. The decrease in cardiac
   function seen with MSC-VSVG treatment versus MSC alone or sham treatment
   was associated with decreased MSC retention, altered immune cell
   responsiveness and reduced vascularization in the heart. This outcome
   garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to
   damaged tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental
   conditions that might promote fusion.}},

Abstract = {{Cold plasma has been shown to provide a promising alternative
   antimicrobial treatment for wound healing. We developed and tested a
   flexible surface dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) and compared it to
   an argon gas based plasma jet operated remotely with a distance between
   plasma plume and sample of 8 mm. Tests were conducted using different
   models: on cultured cells, on ex vivo human skin and on bacteria
   (Pseudomonas aeruginosa) (on agar, in suspension, in collagen/elastin
   matrix or on ex vivo human skin), allowing us to directly compare
   bactericidal with safety aspects under identical conditions.
   Both plasma devices were highly efficient when used on bacteria in
   non-buffered solutions, but DBD was faster in reaching the maximum
   bacterial reduction. Treatment of bacteria on intact skin with DBD
   resulted in up to 6 log reductions in 3 min. The jet was far less
   efficient on intact skin. Even after 8 min treatment no more than 2 log
   reductions were obtained with the jet. Treatment of bacteria in burn
   wound models with DBD for 6 min resulted in a 4.5 log reduction. Even
   when using DBD for 6 min on infected burn wound models with colonizing
   or biofilm phase bacteria, the log reductions were 3.8 or 3.2
   respectively.
   DBD plasma treatment for 6 min did not affect fibroblast viability,
   whereas a treatment for 8 min was detrimental. Similarly, treatment with
   DBD or plasma jet for 6 min did also not affect the metabolic activity
   of skin biopsies. After treatment for 8 min with DBD or plasma jet, 78\%
   or 60\% of activity in skin biopsies remained, respectively. Multiple
   treatments of in vitro burn wound models with surface DBD for 6 min or
   with plasma jet for 8 min did not affect re-epithelialization.
   With the flexible surface DBD plasma strip we were able to quickly
   inactivate large numbers of bacteria on and in skin. Under the same
   conditions, viability of skin cells or re-epithelialization was not
   affected. The DBD source has potential for treating larger wound areas.}},

Abstract = {{Chemical analysis of membrane-bound containers such as secretory
   vesicles, organelles, and exosomes can provide insights into subcellular
   biology. These containers are loaded with a range of important
   biomolecules, which further underscores the need for sensitive and
   selective analysis methods. Here we present a metallic pyramid array for
   intravesicular analysis by combining site-selective dielectrophoresis
   (DEP) and Raman spectroscopy. Sharp pyramidal tips act as a gradient
   force generator to trap nanoparticles or vesicles from the solution, and
   the tips are illuminated by a monochromatic light source for concurrent
   spectroscopic detection of trapped analytes. The parameters suitable for
   DEP trapping were optimized by fluorescence microscopy, and the Raman
   spectroscopy setup was characterized by a nanoparticle based model
   system. Finally, vesicles loaded with 4-mercaptopyridine were
   concentrated at the tips and their Raman spectra were detected in real
   time. These pyramidal tips can perform large-area array-based trapping
   and spectroscopic analysis, opening up possibilities to detect molecules
   inside cells or cell-derived vesicles.}},

Abstract = {{Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles are a major component of
   atmospheric particulate matter, yet their formation processes and
   ambient properties are not well understood. These complex particles
   often contain multiple interfaces due to internal aqueous- and
   organic-phase partitioning. Aerosol interfaces can profoundly affect the
   fate of condensable organic compounds emitted into the atmosphere by
   altering the way in which ambient organic vapors interact with suspended
   particles. To accurately predict the evolution of SOA in the atmosphere,
   we must improve our understanding of aerosol interfaces. In this work,
   biphasic microscale flows are used to measure interfacial tension of
   reacting methylglyoxal, formaldehyde, and ammonium sulfate aqueous
   mixtures with a surrounding oil phase. Our experiments show a
   suppression of interfacial tension as a function of organic content that
   remains constant with reaction time for methylglyoxal ammonium sulfate
   systems. We also reveal an unexpected time dependence of interfacial
   tension over a period of 48 h for ternary solutions of both
   methylglyoxal and formaldehyde in aqueous ammonium sulfate, indicating a
   more complicated behavior of surface activity where there is competition
   among dissolved organics. From these interfacial tension measurements,
   the morphology of aged atmospheric aerosols with internal liquid liquid
   phase separation is inferred.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an active piezoelectric sensing system for concrete
   crack detection that is based on the energy diffusivity method. The
   feasibility of using the energy diffusivity of ultrasound to
   characterize the structural integrity of a pavement is first analyzed.
   Experiments are then carried out to evaluate the performance of this
   approach to crack detection. In addition, the detectable range of this
   system is studied by testing it with cuttings at different angles and
   different distances between sensor and actuator. Results show that by
   analyzing the energy diffusivity density of the sensor responses, cracks
   in the concrete specimen can be detected. This crack detection system
   can be used in highway and airport pavement slabs for pavement health
   monitoring applications.}},

Title = {{Dependency Injection with Static Analysis and Context-Aware Policy}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF OBJECT TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The dependency injection design pattern improves the configurability,
   testability, and maintainability of object-oriented applications by
   decoupling components from both the concrete implementations of their
   dependencies and the strategy employed to select those implementations.
   In recent years, a number of libraries have emerged that provide
   automated support for constructing and connecting dependency-injected
   objects. Our experience developing systems with these tools has led us
   to identify two shortcomings of existing dependency injection solutions:
   the mechanisms for specifying component implementations often make it
   difficult to write and configure systems of arbitrarily-composable
   components, and the toolkit implementations often provide limited
   capabilities for inspection and static analysis of the object graphs of
   dependency-injected systems. We present GRAPHT, an new dependency
   injection container for Java that addresses these issues by providing
   context-aware policy, allowing component implementation decisions to
   depend on where in the object graph a component is required, and using a
   design that allows for static analysis of configured object graphs. To
   achieve its objectives, GRAPHT is built on a mathematical representation
   of dependency injection and object graphs that facilitates static
   analysis and straightforward implementation, and forms a basis for
   further consideration of the capabilities of dependency injection. The
   mathematical representation includes context-aware policy that we show
   to be strictly more expressive than the qualified dependencies used in
   many current toolkits. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with a
   case study showing how GRAPHT has aided in the development of the
   LENSKIT recommender systems toolkit.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric solutions and colloidal suspensions are complex fluidic
   mixtures featuring mesoscopic characteristic length scales. An exciting
   feature of complex fluids is their unusual response to external
   stimulus, such as mechanical, electrical, or chemical forcing, due to
   changes in the orientation, structure, and assembly of the dissolved or
   suspended macromolecules. These tunable polymer and particle dynamics
   and interactions play essential roles in both industrial and
   environmental aqueous processes. In this work, recent advancements in
   complex fluid dynamics and macromolecular assembly in varied
   hydrodynamic fields are highlighted, including viscoelastic
   (de)stabilization in Taylor-Couette flow, colloidal particle assembly in
   electrohydrodynamic flows, and polyelectrolyte-particle flocculation in
   turbulent flows. Polymers including neutral polyethylene oxide and
   charged cationic polyacrylamide and particles including charged
   spherical beads and smectite inorganic clays are explored here.
   Polymer-particle dynamics and assembly, if well understood, can be

Abstract = {{We study a variant of the capacitated vehicle routing problem where the
   cost over each arc is defined as the product of the arc length and the
   weight of the vehicle when it traverses that arc. We propose two new
   mixed-integer linear programming formulations for the problem: an
   arc-load formulation and a set partitioning formulation based on
   q-routes with additional constraints. A family of cycle elimination
   constraints are derived for the arc-load formulation. We then compare
   the linear programming (LP) relaxations of these formulations with the
   two-index one-commodity flow formulation proposed in the literature. In
   particular, we show that the arc-load formulation with the new cycle
   elimination constraints gives the same LP bound as the set partitioning
   formulation based on 2-cycle-free q-routes, which is stronger than the
   LP bound given by the two-index one-commodity flow formulation. We
   propose a branch-and-cut algorithm for the arc-load formulation, and a
   branch-cut-and-price algorithm for the set partitioning formulation
   strengthened by additional constraints. Computational results on
   instances from the literature demonstrate that a significant improvement
   can be achieved by the branch-cut-and-price algorithm over other
   methods.}},

Title = {{Hidden-City Ticketing: The Cause and Impact}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{50}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Hidden-city ticketing is an interesting airline ticket-pricing
   phenomenon. It occurs when an itinerary connecting at an intermediate
   city is less expensive than a ticket from the origin to the intermediate
   city. In such a case, passengers traveling to the intermediate city have
   an incentive to pretend to be traveling to the final destination,
   deplane at the connection point, and forgo the unused portion of the
   ticket. Hidden-city opportunities are not uncommon nowadays.
   In this paper, we establish a mathematical model to shed some light on
   the cause of hidden-city opportunities and the impact of (the
   passengers') hidden-city ticketing practice on both the airlines'
   revenues and consumer welfare. To perform our study, we adapt a network
   revenue management model. We illustrate that the hidden-city opportunity
   may arise when there is a large difference in the price elasticity of
   demand on related itineraries, providing a plausible explanation for
   this phenomenon. To show the impact of the hidden-city ticketing
   practice on the airlines' revenues, we first argue that when passengers
   take advantage of such opportunities, the airlines should react, and the
   optimal reaction would be to eliminate any hidden-city opportunities.
   However, even if the airline optimally reacts, the revenue gained is
   still less than the optimal revenue it could have earned if passengers
   did not take advantage of hidden-city opportunities. Moreover, under our
   model, the revenue decrease could be as much as half of the optimal
   revenue when passengers do not use hidden-city tickets, but it cannot be
   more if the airline's network has a hub-and-spoke structure. We also
   show that when passengers take advantage of hidden-city opportunities,
   the prices of certain itineraries will rise, which is a disadvantage to
   the passengers in the long run.}},

Title = {{Neurons that detect interocular conflict during binocular rivalry
   revealed with EEG}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{When the two eyes view incompatible images, perception alternates
   between them. What neural computations underlie this binocular rivalry?
   Perceptual alternations may simply reflect competition between the sets
   of monocular neurons that respond to each image, with the stronger
   driving perception. Here, we test an alternative hypothesis, that the
   computations that resolve rivalry make use of an active signal that
   reflects interocular conflict. Images presented to each eye were
   flickered at different frequencies while we measured steady-state
   visually evoked potentials (SSVEP). Signals at frequencies that are
   combinations of the two input frequencies can arise only from binocular
   neurons. In a first experiment, we measured energy at these
   ``intermodulation'' frequencies during binocular rivalry and found it to
   be highest immediately before rivalry restarted following a period of
   incomplete resolution of rivalry (a ``mixed'' percept). This suggests
   that the intermodulation signals may arise from neurons important for
   resolving the conflict between the two eyes' inputs. In a second
   experiment, we tested whether the intermodulation signal arose from
   neurons that measure interocular conflict by parametrically increasing
   conflict while simultaneously reducing image contrast. The activity of
   neurons that receive input from both eyes but are not sensitive to
   conflict should reduce monotonically as contrast decreases. The
   intermodulation response, however, peaked at intermediate levels of
   conflict, suggesting that it arises in part from neurons that respond to
   interocular conflict. Binocular rivalry appears to depend on an active
   mechanism that detects interocular conflict, whose levels of activity
   can be measured by the intermodulation frequencies of the SSVEP.}},

Abstract = {{An investigation into the interactions between a model axial-flow
   hydrokinetic turbine (rotor diameter, d(T)=0.15 m) and the complex
   hydrodynamics and sediment transport processes within a meandering
   channel was carried out in the Outdoor StreamLab research facility at
   the University of Minnesota St. Anthony Falls Laboratory. This
   field-scale meandering stream with bulk flow and sediment discharge
   control provided a location for high spatiotemporally resolved
   measurements of bed and water surface elevations around the model
   turbine. The device was installed within an asymmetric, erodible channel
   cross section under migrating bed form and fixed outer bank conditions.
   A comparative analysis between velocity and topographic measurements,
   with and without the turbine installed, highlights the local and
   nonlocal features of the turbine-induced scour and deposition patterns.
   In particular, it shows how the cross-section geometry changes, how the
   bed form characteristics are altered, and how the mean flow field is
   distorted both upstream and downstream of the turbine. We further
   compare and discuss how current energy conversion deployments in meander
   regions would result in different interactions between the turbine
   operation and the local and nonlocal bathymetry compared to straight
   channels.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A micro catalytic methane sensor was proposed and fabricated on a bulk
   fused quartz substrate using a high resolution screen printing technique
   for the first time, with reduced power consumption and optimized
   sensitivity. The sensor was designed by the finite element method and
   quartz was chosen as the substrate material and alumina support with
   optimized dimensions. Fabrication of the sensor consisted of two MEMS
   processes, lift-off and high resolution screen printing, with the
   advantages of high yield and uniformity. When the sensor's regional
   working temperature changes from 250 degrees C to 470 degrees C, its
   sensitivity increases, as well as the power consumption. The highest
   sensitivity can reach 1.52 mV/\% CH4. A temperature of 300 degrees C was
   chosen as the optimized working temperature, and the sensor's
   sensitivity, power consumption, nonlinearity and response time are 0.77
   mV/\% CH4, 415 mW, 2.6\%, and 35 s, respectively. This simple, but
   highly uniform fabrication process and the reliable performance of this
   sensor may lead to wide applications for methane detection.}},

Title = {{Median ellipse parameterization for robust measurement of fuel droplet
   size}},
Journal = {{MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The combustion properties of blended fuel combinations can be
   characterized by performing single droplet fuel combustion experiments.
   These combustion experiments are visualized using high speed image
   acquisition. Once the high speed images are obtained, the burn rate and
   other characteristics of combustion, such as the occurrence of
   microexplosions, can be characterized. Currently these quantities are
   either measured manually or are measured using automated software.
   However, the current software packages used for this task are limited in
   that they can only measure droplets that are elliptical in shape and
   manual corrections often have to be made to avoid significant errors in
   the measurement. An automated droplet tracking algorithm is presented
   that can automatically track droplet size without manual intervention
   due to its robustness to the presence of missing or extra edges in the
   images. In addition, the proposed method can track shapes more general
   than ellipses, which is required in order to track the droplet during
   microexplosions. The proposed algorithm starts by fitting ellipses to
   numerous five point subsets from the droplet edge data. The closed
   contour is parameterized by determining the median perimeter of the set
   of ellipses. The resulting curve is not an ellipse, allowing arbitrary
   closed contours to be parameterized. The performance of the proposed
   algorithm and the performance of existing algorithms are compared to a
   ground truth segmentation of the fuel droplet images. This comparison
   demonstrates that the median ellipse parameterization algorithm has
   improved performance for both area quantification and edge deviation.}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Neighbor Discovery (ND) plays an important role in the initialization
   phase of wireless sensor networks. In real deployments, sensor nodes may
   not always be awake due to limited power supply, which forms low
   duty-cycle networks. Existing researches on the problem of ND in
   low-duty-cycle networks are all based on the assumption that a receiver
   can receive only one packet successfully at a time. k-Multipacket
   Reception (MPR) techniques (i.e., k (k >= 2) packets can be successfully
   received at a time) have shown their significance in improving packet
   transmission. However, how MPR can benefit the problem of ND is still
   unknown. In this paper, we are the first to discuss the problem of ND in
   low-duty-cycle networks with MPR. Specifically, we first present a novel
   ALOHA-like protocol, and show that the expected time to discover all n-1
   neighbors is O(n logn log log n/k) by reducing the problem to a
   generalized form of the classic K Coupon Collector's Problem. Second, we
   show that when there is a feedback mechanism to inform a node whether
   its transmission is successful or not, ND can be finished in time O(n
   log log n/k). Third, we point out that lacking of knowledge of n results
   in a factor of two slowdown in the two protocols proposed. We also
   discuss some extensions related to the protocol's design and different
   MPR models. Finally, we evaluate the ND protocols introduced in this
   paper, and compare their performance with the analysis results. (C) 2015

Volume = {{61}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Due to the highly dynamic traffic load, providing delay-sensitive
   services is a challenge in data centers. Many recent transport
   protocols, such as DCTCP, D2TCP, and L2DCT, use Explicit Congestion
   Notification (ECN) to control the switch queue length for achieving
   low-latency transmission. However, the original ECN marking threshold
   fails to make real-time tradeoff between bottleneck link utilization and
   queueing delay, thereby increasing the flow completion time. In this
   paper, we propose Adaptive Marking Threshold (AMT), which proactively
   tunes the marking threshold to eliminate the unnecessary queueing delay,
   and maintains high link utilization at the same time. The experimental
   results of NS2 simulation and physical testbed show that AMT
   significantly reduces the flow completion time of typical applications
   across different network scenarios with negligible change in the data
   center switch. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Sand waves arise in subaqueous and Aeolian environments as the result of
   the complex interaction between turbulent flows and mobile sand beds.
   They occur across a wide range of spatial scales, evolve at temporal
   scales much slower than the integral scale of the transporting turbulent
   flow, dominate river morphodynamics, undermine stream-bank stability and
   infrastructure during flooding, and sculpt terrestrial and
   extraterrestrial landscapes. In this paper, we present the vision for
   our work over the last ten years, which has sought to develop
   computational tools capable of simulating the coupled interactions of
   sand waves with turbulence across the broad range of relevant scales:
   from small-scale ripples in laboratory flumes to mega-dunes in large
   rivers. We review the computational advances that have enabled us to
   simulate the genesis and long-term evolution of arbitrarily large and
   complex sand dunes in turbulent flows using large-eddy simulation and
   summarize numerous novel physical insights derived from our simulations.
   Our findings explain the role of turbulent sweeps in the near-bed region
   as the primary mechanism for destabilizing the sand bed, show that the
   seeds of the emergent structure in dune fields lie in the heterogeneity
   of the turbulence and bed shear stress fluctuations over the initially
   flatbed, and elucidate how large dunes at equilibrium give rise to
   energetic coherent structures and modify the spectra of turbulence. We
   also discuss future challenges and our vision for advancing a
   data-driven simulation-based engineering science approach for
   site-specific simulations of river flooding. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{Multicell cooperative processing with limited backhaul traffic is
   studied for cellular uplinks. Aiming at reduced backhaul overhead, a
   sparse multicell linear receive-filter design problem is formulated.
   Both unstructured distributed cooperation and clustered cooperation, in
   which base station groups are formed for tight cooperation, are
   considered. Dynamic clustered cooperation, where the sparse equalizer
   and the cooperation clusters are jointly determined, is solved via
   alternating minimization based on spectral clustering and group-sparse
   regression. Furthermore, decentralized implementations of both
   unstructured and clustered cooperation schemes are developed for
   scalability, robustness, and computational efficiency. Extensive
   numerical tests verify the efficacy of the proposed methods.}},

Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},

Abstract = {{Establishing fundamental relationships between strain and work function
   (WF) in organic semiconductors is important not only for understanding
   electrical properties of organic thin films, which are subject to both
   intrinsic and extrinsic strains, but also for developing flexible
   electronic devices. Here we investigate tensile and compressive strain
   effects on the WF of rubrene single crystals. Mechanical strain induced
   by thermal expansion mismatch between the substrate and rubrene is
   quantified by X-ray diffraction. The corresponding WF change is measured
   by scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. The WF of rubrene increases
   (decreases) significantly with in-plane tensile (compressive) strain,
   which agrees qualitatively with density functional theory calculations.
   An elastic-to-plastic transition, characterized by a steep rise of the
   WF, occurs at similar to B0.05\% tensile strain along the rubrene
   pi-stacking direction. The results provide the first concrete link
   between mechanical strain and WF of an organic semiconductor and have
   important implications for understanding the connection between
   structural and electronic disorder in soft organic electronic materials.}},

Abstract = {{We consider particles obeying Langevin dynamics while being at known
   positions and having known velocities at the two end-points of a given
   interval. Their motion in phase space can be modeled as an
   Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process conditioned at the two end-points-a
   generalization of the Brownian bridge. Using standard ideas from
   stochastic optimal control we construct a stochastic differential
   equation (SDE) that generates such a bridge that agrees with the
   statistics of the conditioned process, as a degenerate diffusion. Higher
   order linear diffusions are also considered. In general, a time-varying
   drift is sufficient to modify the prior SDE and meet the end-point
   conditions. When the drift is obtained by solving a suitable
   differential Lyapunov equation, the SDE models correctly the statistics
   of the bridge. These types of models are relevant in controlling and
   modeling distribution of particles and the interpolation of density
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{Electromigration (EM) in on-chip metal interconnects is a critical
   reliability-driven failure mechanism in nanometer-scale technologies.
   This paper addresses the problem of EM on signal interconnects and on
   Vdd and Vss rails within a standard cell. An approach for modeling and
   efficient characterization of cell-internal EM is developed,
   incorporating Joule heating effects. We also present a graph-based
   algorithm that computes the currents when the pin position is moved
   avoiding a new characterization for each pin position and consequently
   considerably reducing the characterization time. We use the cell
   lifetime analysis to determine the lifetime of large benchmark circuits,
   and show that these circuit lifetimes can be improved by about 2.5x-161x
   by avoiding the EM-critical output, Vdd, and Vss pin positions of the
   cells, using minor layout modifications.}},

Abstract = {{Optical metafluids that consist of colloidal solutions of plasmonic
   and/or excitonic nanomaterials may play important roles as functional
   working fluids or as means for producing solid metamaterial coatings.
   The concept of a metafluid employed here is based on the picture that a
   single ballistic photon, propagating through the metafluid, interacts
   with a large collection of specifically designed optically active
   nanocrystals. We demonstrate water-based metafluids that act as
   broadband electromagnetic absorbers in a spectral range of 200-3300 nm
   and feature a tunable narrow (similar to 100 nm) transparency window in
   the visible-to-near-infrared region. To define this transparency window,
   we employ plasmonic gold nanorods. We utilize excitonic boron-doped
   silicon nanocrystals as opaque optical absorbers ({''}optical wall{''})
   in the UV and blue-green range of the spectrum. Water itself acts as an
   opaque ``wall{''} in the near-infrared to infrared. We explore the
   limits of the concept of a ``simple{''} metafluid by computationally
   testing and validating the effective medium approach based on the
   Beer-Lambert law. According to our simulations and experiments, particle
   aggregation and the associated decay of the window effect are one
   example of the failure of the simple metafluid concept due to strong
   interparticle interactions.}},

Abstract = {{Creating polymeric biomaterials with antifouling surface properties that
   persist after mechanical abrasion is a significant challenge. We report
   a simple but effective approach based on nanocomposites consisting of a
   bulk biocompatible polymer, polycaprolactone (PCL), admixed with a
   minute fraction (1-3 wt \%) of nanoparticles consisting of a hyaluronic
   acid (HA)-PCL graft copolymer (HA-g-PCL). In a non aqueous solvent such
   as chloroform, the HA-PCL graft copolymer adopts a reverse-micelle-like
   structure with a shell dominated by PCL chains, allowing it to be mixed
   well with high-molecular-weight PCL in the same solvent and cast into a
   nanocomposite film. Upon exposure to aqueous buffer, the HA-g-PCL
   nanoparticles reveal the hydrophilic chains of HA to face the outside,
   conferring a hydrophilic ``slimy{''} or ``artificial mucus{''} layer to
   the bulk PCL film that resists protein and cell adhesion, without
   altering bulk mechanical properties. After mechanical abrasion, the
   nanoparticles replenish the newly exposed material surface with HA,
   sustaining the surface's protein/cell resistance. This approach could
   apply to a wide range of biodegradable polymers to achieve consistent
   antifouling capacity in the face of mechanical abrasion.}},

Abstract = {{Metallic-acidic bifunctionality of molybdenum carbidic catalytic
   formulations can be tuned by oxygen cofeed and reductive pretreatments
   to control carbonyl hydrodeoxygenation (HDO). Acetone is deoxygenated
   over activated Mo2C via sequential hydrogenation of acetone to
   equilibrium and subsequent dehydration of isopropyl alcohol (IPA).
   Dehydration to propylene occurs over Bronsted acid sites with an
   intrinsic activation energy of 103 +/- 1 kJ mol(-1) and a
   rate-determining step of beta-hydrogen scission, as inferred from a
   kinetic isotope effect (KIE) of 1.85. HDO rate-determining dehydration
   rates were kinetically independent of H-2 and oxygenate pressure from 10
   to 82 kPa and from 0.05 to 4 kPa, respectively. Both the kinetics and
   the deoxygenation reaction pathway were shown to be similar for the
   aldehyde group of propanal. Oxygen treatment of activated carbides via
   13.5 kPa O-2 cofeed was shown to decrease the catalyst surface area from
   68 to 9 m(2) g(-1) and to suppress metallic hydrogenation of acetone to
   IPA. IPA dehydration rates per gram of catalyst could be altered by a
   factor of similar to 60; a longer activation time under H-2 flow at 773
   K increased dehydration activation energies from 103 to 140 kJ mol(-1),
   decreased Bronsted acid site densities, and decreased
   2,6-di-tert-butylpyridine-normalized dehydration turnover frequencies,
   indicative of a reduction-induced change in the number and nature of the
   acid sites.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Berberine is a drug with an intense bitter taste. The high aqueous
   solubility of its chloride salt, which is commonly used in commercial
   drug products of berberine, worsens the challenge of taste masking. We
   have approached this drug delivery challenge by forming salts with the
   sweeteners acesulfame and saccharine, through the anion exchange
   reaction. In addition to the intrinsic sweetness of the two counterions,
   both salts also exhibit reduced aqueous solubility, which further
   alleviates the problem of bitter taste of the drug by limiting
   dissolution of berberine. Moreover, both salts exhibit good tableting
   performance. They are also non-hygroscopic and stable against high
   humidity and temperature. The stability against humidity variations
   makes the two sweet salts more amenable for tablet development over the
   chloride salt, which undergoes complex hydration/dehydration phase
   changes when relative humidity varies. Collectively, the two novel solid
   phases of berberine are sweet and exhibit superior properties for
   developing pharmaceutically elegant drug products.}},

Abstract = {{Small nonprotein-coding microRNAs (miRNAs) are present in most
   eukaryotes and are central effectors of RNA silencing-mediated
   mechanisms for gene expression regulation. In plants, DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1)
   is the founding member of a highly conserved family of RNase III-like
   endonucleases that function as core machinery proteins to process
   hairpin-like precursor transcripts into mature miRNAs, small regulatory
   RNAs, 21-22 nucleotides in length. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) were
   used to generate single and double-mutants of putative soybean DCL1
   homologs, DCL1a and DCL1b, to confirm their functional role(s) in the
   soybean miRNA pathway. Neither DCL1 single mutant, dcl1a or dcl1b
   plants, exhibited a pronounced morphological or molecular phenotype.
   However, the dcl1a/dcl1b double mutant expressed a strong morphological
   phenotype, characterized by reduced seed size and aborted seedling
   development, in addition to defective miRNA precursor transcript
   processing efficiency and deregulated miRNA target gene expression.
   Together, these findings indicate that the two soybean DCL1 paralogs,
   DCL1a and DCL1b, largely play functionally redundant roles in the miRNA
   pathway and are essential for normal plant development.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Random fiber networks are assemblies of elastic elements connected in
   random configurations. They are used as models for a broad range of
   fibrous materials including biopolymer gels and synthetic nonwovens.
   Although the mechanics of networks made from the same type of fibers has
   been studied extensively, the behavior of composite systems of fibers
   with different properties has received less attention. In this work we
   numerically and theoretically study random networks of beams and springs
   of different mechanical properties. We observe that the overall network
   stiffness decreases on average as the variability of fiber stiffness
   increases, at constant mean fiber stiffness. Numerical results and
   analytical arguments show that for small variabilities in fiber
   stiffness the amount of network softening scales linearly with the
   variance of the fiber stiffness distribution. This result holds for any
   beam structure and is expected to apply to a broad range of materials
   including cellular solids. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymer (SMP) foams have been developed for use in
   neurovascular occlusion applications. These materials are predominantly
   polyurethanes that are known for their biocompatibility and tunable
   properties. However, these polymers inherently lack X-ray visibility,
   which is a significant challenge for their use as implantable materials.
   Herein, low density, highly porous shape memory polyurethane foams were
   developed with tungsten nanoparticles dispersed into the foam matrix, at
   increasing concentrations, to serve as a radiopaque agent. Utilizing
   X-ray fluoroscopy sufficient visibility of the foams at small geometries
   was observed. Thermal characterization of the foams indicated altered
   thermal response and delayed foam actuation with increasing nanoparticle
   loading (because of restricted network mobility). Mechanical testing
   indicated decreased toughness and strength for higher loading because of
   disruption of the SMP matrix. Overall, filler addition imparted x-ray
   visibility to the SMP foams and allowed for tuned control of the
   transition temperature and actuation kinetics for the material.

   angle of internal friction (phi(e)), were assessed. Powder flow
   properties deteriorated continuously with,increasing RH, as shown by the
   higher f(c) and tau(c) as well as lower ffc, under all stress
   conditions. With increasing RH, rho(b) increased and then decreased with
   a maximum at 20\% RH. The phi(e) initially increased, from 41 to 43
   degrees, and then remained approximately constant from 20\% to 92\% RH.
   The deterioration in powder flow properties is caused by surface
   modification by moisture, which enhances particle-particle interaction
   strength. The knowledge obtained in this study is useful to achieving
   consistent properties of this important tablet excipient and
   formulations containing it. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spalling near a free surface in laboratory experiments on two sandstones
   was characterized using acoustic emission and digital image correlation.
   A surface instability apparatus was used to reproduce a state of plane
   strain near a free surface in a modeled semi-infinite medium subjected
   to far-field compressive stress. Comparison between AE locations and
   crack trajectory mapped after the test showed good consistency. Digital
   image correlation was used to find the displacements in directions
   parallel (axial direction) and perpendicular (lateral direction) to the
   free surface at various stages of loading. At a load ratio, LR = current
   load/peak load, of approximately 30 \%, elastic deformation was
   measured. At 70-80 \% LR, the free-face effect started to appear in the
   displacement contours, especially for the lateral displacement
   measurements. As the axial compressive stress increased close to peak,
   extensional lateral strain started to show concentrations associated
   with localized damage. Continuum damage mechanics was used to describe
   damage evolution in the surface instability test, and it was shown that
   a critical value of extensional inelastic strain, on the order of
   -10(-3) for the virgin sandstones, may provide an indicator for
   determining the onset of surface spalling.}},

Abstract = {{Programming deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems currently involves a
   clinician manually sweeping through a range of stimulus parameter
   settings to identify the setting that delivers the most robust therapy
   for a patient. With the advent of DBS arrays with a higher number and
   density of electrodes, this trial and error process becomes unmanageable
   in a clinical setting. This study developed a computationally efficient,
   model-based algorithm to estimate an electrode configuration that will
   most strongly activate tissue within a volume of interest. The
   cerebellar-receiving area of motor thalamus, the target for treating
   essential tremor with DBS, was rendered from imaging data and
   discretized into grid points aligned in approximate afferent and
   efferent axonal pathway orientations. A finite-element model (FEM) was
   constructed to simulate the volumetric tissue voltage during DBS. We
   lever-aged the principle of voltage superposition to formulate a convex
   optimization-based approach tomaximize activating function (AF) values
   at each grid point (via three different criteria), hence increasing the
   overall probability of action potential initiation and neuronal
   entrainment within the target volume. For both efferent and afferent
   pathways, this approach achieved global optima within several seconds.
   The optimal electrode configuration and resulting AF values differed
   across each optimization criteria and between axonal orientations. This
   approach only required a set of FEM simulations equal to the number of
   DBS array electrodes, and could readily accommodate
   anisotropic-inhomogeneous tissue conductances or other axonal
   orientations. The algorithm provides an efficient, flexible
   determination of optimal electrode configurations for programming DBS
   arrays.}},

Abstract = {{This research review aims to focus attention on the effect of specific
   surgical and host factors on implant fixation, and the importance of
   accounting for them in experimental and numerical models. These factors
   affect (a) eventual clinical applicability and (b) reproducibility of
   findings across research groups. Proper function and longevity for
   orthopedic joint replacement implants relies on secure fixation to the
   surrounding bone. Technology and surgical technique has improved over
   the last 50 years, and robust ingrowth and decades of implant survival
   is now routinely achieved for healthy patients and first-time (primary)
   implantation. Second-time (revision) implantation presents with bone
   loss with interfacial bone gaps in areas vital for secure mechanical
   fixation. Patients with medical comorbidities such as infection,
   smoking, congestive heart failure, kidney disease, and diabetes have a
   diminished healing response, poorer implant fixation, and greater
   revision risk. It is these more difficult clinical scenarios that
   require research to evaluate more advanced treatment approaches. Such
   treatments can include osteogenic or antimicrobial implant coatings,
   allo-or autogenous cellular or tissue-based approaches, local and
   systemic drug delivery, surgical approaches. Regarding implant-related
   approaches, most experimental and numerical models do not generally
   impose conditions that represent mechanical instability at the implant
   interface, or recalcitrant healing. Many treatments will work well in
   forgiving settings, but fail in complex human settings with disease,
   bone loss, or previous surgery. Ethical considerations mandate that we
   justify and limit the number of animals tested, which restricts
   experimental permutations of treatments. Numerical models provide
   flexibility to evaluate multiple parameters and combinations, but
   generally need to employ simplifying assumptions. The objectives of this
   paper are to (a) to highlight the importance of mechanical, material,
   and surgical features to influence implant-bone healing, using a
   selection of results from two decades of coordinated experimental and
   numerical work and (b) discuss limitations of such models and the
   implications for research reproducibility. Focusing model conditions
   toward the clinical scenario to be studied, and limiting conclusions to
   the conditions of a particular model can increase clinical relevance and
   research reproducibility.}},

Abstract = {{Correlation networks identified from financial, genomic, ecological,
   epidemiological, social, and climatic data are being used to provide
   useful topological insights into the structure of high-dimensional data.
   Strong convection over the oceans and the atmospheric moisture transport
   and flow convergence indicated by atmospheric pressure fields may
   determine where and when extreme precipitation occurs. Here, the
   spatiotemporal relationship among sea surface temperature (SST), sea
   level pressure (SLP), and extreme global precipitation is explored using
   a graph-based approach that uses the concept of reciprocity to generate
   cluster pairs of locations with similar spatiotemporal patterns at any
   time lag. A global time-lagged relationship between pentad SST anomalies
   and pentad SLP anomalies is investigated to understand the linkages and
   influence of the slowly changing oceanic boundary conditions on the
   development of the global atmospheric circulation. This study explores
   the use of this correlation network to predict extreme precipitation
   globally over the next 30 days, using a logistic principal component
   regression on the strong global dipoles found between SST and SLP.
   Predictive skill under cross validation and blind prediction for the
   occurrence of 30-day precipitation that is higher than the 90th
   percentile of days in the wet season is indicated for the selected
   global regions considered.}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the dimensionality of a physical system can have a profound
   effect on its properties, as in the ordering of low-dimensional magnetic
   materials(1), phonon dispersion in mercury chain salts(2), sliding
   phases(3), and the electronic states of graphene(4). Here we explore the
   emergence of quasi-one-dimensional behaviour in two-dimensional
   artificial spin ice, a class of lithographically fabricated nanomagnet
   arrays used to study geometrical frustration(5-7). We extend the
   implementation of artificial spin ice by fabricating a new array
   geometry, the so-called tetris lattice(8) . We demonstrate that the
   ground state of the tetris lattice consists of alternating ordered and
   disordered bands of nanomagnetic moments. The disordered bands can be
   mapped onto an emergent thermal one-dimensional Ising model.
   Furthermore, we show that the level of degeneracy associated with these
   bands dictates the susceptibility of island moments to thermally induced
   reversals, thus establishing that vertex frustration can reduce the
   relevant dimensionality of physical behaviour in a magnetic system.}},

Abstract = {{We have established methods for site-directed mutagenesis via
   transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) in the
   endogenous rice (Oryza sativa) waxy gene and demonstrated stable
   inheritance of TALEN-induced somatic mutations to the progeny. To
   analyze the role of classical nonhomologous end joining (cNHEJ) and
   alternative nonhomologous end joining (altNHEJ) pathways in
   TALEN-induced mutagenesis in plant cells, we investigated whether a lack
   of DNA Ligase4 (Lig4) affects the kinetics of TALEN-induced
   double-strand break repair in rice cells. Deep-sequencing analysis
   revealed that the frequency of all types of mutations, namely deletion,
   insertion, combination of insertion with deletion, and substitution, in
   lig4 null mutant calli was higher than that in a lig4 heterozygous
   mutant or the wild type. In addition, the ratio of large deletions
   (greater than 10 bp) and deletions repaired by microhomology-mediated
   end joining (MMEJ) to total deletion mutations in lig4 null mutant calli
   was higher than that in the lig4 heterozygous mutant or wild type.
   Furthermore, almost all insertions (2 bp or greater) were shown to be
   processed via copy and paste of one or more regions around the TALENs
   cleavage site and rejoined via MMEJ regardless of genetic background.
   Taken together, our findings indicate that the dysfunction of cNHEJ
   leads to a shift in the repair pathway from cNHEJ to altNHEJ or
   synthesis-dependent strand annealing.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{124}},
Pages = {{82-88}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Solar selective coatings that absorb solar incident light but that
   inhibit emission of thermal light can have a dramatic impact on the
   performance of Direct Steam Generation (DSG) systems. In prior art,
   perfect coatings with instantaneous transitions between high absorption
   and low absorption have been modeled. In this paper non-ideal spectral,
   environmental, and material properties of solar selective coatings are
   shown to have significant effects on the efficiencies and optimum
   transition wavelengths of real systems. By introducing more real world
   parameters into the coating optimization it is desired that a more cost
   effective and efficient system can be built. It is shown that using
   ideal conditions the optimum transition wavelength for a DSG system is
   1.4 mu m with an efficiency of 55.7\%. Whereas for a realistic non-ideal
   DSG system the optimum transition is at 3.4 mu m resulting in an
   efficiency around 30\% depending on the concentration factor used. It is
   then shown that an optimized selective coating will be outperformed by a
   simple non-selective black absorber with 95\% absorption at
   concentration factors above 80 and above 130 when the AM1.5 spectrum is
   used. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{b-oriented silicalite-1 membranes on porous silica supports were
   synthesized using gel-free secondary growth. The porous silica supports
   were made by pressing crushed quartz fibers followed by sintering and
   polishing, and further modified by slip-coating three layers of Stober
   silica particles (1000, 350, and 50 nm). The b-oriented seed layers were
   prepared by rubbing silicalite-1 particles (2 m x 0.8 m x 3 m along a-,
   b-, and c-axis, respectively) after depositing a polymeric layer on the
   support. After silicalite-1 seed deposition, a final coating of
   spherical silica particles was applied. Well-intergrown, m-thick,
   b-oriented membranes were obtained, which, after calcination, exhibited
   ethanol permselectivity in ethanol/water mixture pervaporation. At 60
   degrees C and for approximate to 5 wt \% ethanol/water mixtures, the
   best membrane exhibited overall pervaporation separation factor of 85
   (corresponding to membrane intrinsic selectivity of 7.7) and total flux
   of 2.1 kg/(m(2)h). This performance is comparable to the best performing

   interrogating single nanoparticles. In these experiments optical
   extinction is measured by moving the particle in and out of a tightly

   of the SMS signal to particles with sizes comparable to or larger than
   the laser spot, where the shape of the particle matters. These results
   are important for the analysis of polydisperse samples that have a wide
   range of sizes. The presented example images and analysis of a carbon
   microparticle sample show the utility of the derived expressions. In
   particular, we show that SMS can be used to generate extinction

Abstract = {{Microblogging services have become among the most popular services on
   the web in the last few years. This led to significant increase in data
   size, speed, and applications. This paper presents Venus; a system that
   supports real-time spatial queries on microblogs. Venus supports its
   queries on a spatial boundary R and a temporal boundary T, from which
   only the top-k microblogs are returned in the query answer based on a
   spatio-temporal ranking function. Supporting such queries requires Venus
   to digest hundreds of millions of real-time microblogs in main-memory
   with high rates, yet, it provides low query responses and efficient
   memory utilization. To this end, Venus employs: (1) an efficient
   in-memory spatio-temporal index that digests high rates of incoming
   microblogs in real time, (2) a scalable query processor that prune the
   search space, R and T, effectively to provide low query latency on
   millions of items in real time, and (3) a group of memory optimization
   techniques that provide system administrators with different options to
   save significant memory resources while keeping the query accuracy
   almost perfect. Venus memory optimization techniques make use of the
   local arrival rates of microblogs to smartly shed microblogs that are
   old enough not to contribute to any query answer. In addition, Venus can
   adaptively, in real time, adjust its load shedding based on both the
   spatial distribution and the parameters of incoming query loads. All
   Venus components can accommodate different spatial and temporal ranking
   functions that are able to capture the importance of each dimension
   differently depending on the applications requirements. Extensive
   experimental results based on real Twitter data and actual locations of
   Bing search queries show that Venus supports high arrival rates of up to
   64 K microblogs/second and average query latency of 4 msec.}},

Title = {{Fractionation of engine exhaust hydrocarbons using flame ionization

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{17}},

Abstract = {{The flame ionization detector is a standard instrument for measuring
   total hydrocarbon concentration in engine exhaust. Engine combustion
   modes such as diesel low-temperature combustion are known to produce
   higher levels of total hydrocarbon than conventional combustion modes,
   and a need exists to estimate species that may nucleate into
   nanoparticles upon dilution in the atmosphere. Exhaust hydrocarbon
   fractionation is useful for gaining better understanding about engine
   combustion and for developing aftertreatment catalysts for reducing
   emissions. Methods capable of measuring individual hydrocarbon species
   such as gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry
   do not measure the full range of species present in engine exhaust and
   are expensive. In this work, a custom-designed variable temperature
   sample conditioner was developed for use with two fast-response flame
   ionization detectors to fractionate the hydrocarbons present in engine
   exhaust as a function of component volatility. A condensation model for
   fuel alkanes was also developed to be used in concert with the
   experimental data to determine the fraction of fuel-like hydrocarbons
   within the total hydrocarbon measurement. Our results indicate that the
   variable temperature flame ionization detector method yields similar
   unburned hydrocarbon fraction to reported literature values using more

Title = {{Performance of a plastic-wrapped composting system for biosecure
   emergency disposal of disease-related swine mortalities}},
Journal = {{WASTE MANAGEMENT}},

Abstract = {{A passively-ventilated plastic-wrapped composting system initially
   developed for biosecure disposal of poultry mortalities caused by avian
   influenza was adapted and tested to assess its potential as an emergency
   disposal option for disease-related swine mortalities. Fresh air was
   supplied through perforated plastic tubing routed through the base of
   the compost pile. The combined air inlet and top vent area is <=similar
   to 1\% of the gas exchange surface of a conventional uncovered windrow.
   Parameters evaluated included: (1) spatial and temporal variations in
   matrix moisture content (m.c.), leachate production, and matrix O-2
   concentrations; (2) extent of soft tissue decomposition; and (3)
   internal temperature and the success rate in achieving USEPA
   time/temperature (T) criteria for pathogen reduction. Six envelope
   materials (wood shavings, corn silage, ground cornstalks, ground oat
   straw, ground soybean straw, or ground alfalfa hay) and two initial
   m.c.'s (15-30\% w.b. for materials stored indoors, and 45-65\% w.b. to
   simulate materials exposed to precipitation) were tested to determine
   their effect on performance parameters (1-3). Results of
   triple-replicated field trials showed that the composting system did not
   accumulate moisture despite the 150 kg carcass water load (65\% of 225
   kg total carcass mass) released during decomposition. Mean compost m.c.
   in the carcass layer declined by similar to 7 percentage points during
   8-week trials, and a leachate accumulation was rare. Matrix O-2
   concentrations for all materials other than silage were >= 10\% using
   the equivalent of 2 m inlet/vent spacing. In silage O-2 dropped below
   5\% in some cases even when 0.5 m inlet/vent spacing was used. Eight
   week soft tissue decomposition ranged from 87\% in cornstalks to 72\% in
   silage. Success rates for achievement of USEPA Class B time/temperature
   criteria ranged from 91\% for silage to 33-57\% for other materials.
   Companion laboratory biodegradation studies suggest that Class B success
   rates can be improved by slightly increasing envelope material m.c.
   Moistening initially dry (15\% m.c.) envelope materials to 35\% m.c.
   nearly doubled their heat production potential, boosting it to levels >=
   silage. The `contradictory' silage test results showing high
   temperatures paired with slow soft tissue degradation are likely due to
   this material's high density, low gas permeability and low water vapor
   loss. While slow decomposition typically suggests low microbial activity
   and heat production, it does not rule out high internal temperatures if
   the heat produced is conserved. Occasional short-term odor releases
   during the first 2 weeks of composting were associated with
   top-to-bottom gas flow which is contrary to the typical
   bottom-to-top{''} flow typically observed in conventional compost piles.
   In cases where biosecurity concerns are paramount, results of this study
   show the plastic-wrapped passively ventilated composting method to have
   good potential for above-ground swine mortality disposal. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci infections are a significant clinical
   problem. One proposed solution is to use probiotics, such as lactic acid
   bacteria, to produce antimicrobial peptides at the site of infection.
   Enterocin A, a class 2a bacteriocin, exhibits inhibitory activity
   against E. faecium and E. faecalis, which account for 86\% of
   vancomycin-resistant Enterococci infections. In this study, we aimed to
   engineer enterocin A mutants with enhanced potency within a lactic acid
   bacterial production system. Peptide mutants resulting from saturation
   mutagenesis at sites A24 and T27 were efficiently screened in a 96-well
   plate assay for inhibition of pathogen growth. Several mutants exhibit
   increased potency relative to wild-type enterocin A in both liquid-and
   solid-medium growth assays. In particular, A24P and T27G exhibit
   enhanced inhibition of multiple strains of E. faecium and E. faecalis,
   including clinically isolated vancomycin-resistant strains. A24P and
   T27G enhance killing of E. faecium 8 by 13 +/- 3- and 18 +/- 4-fold,
   respectively. The engineered enterocin A/lactic acid bacteria systems
   offer significant potential to combat antibiotic-resistant infections.

Abstract = {{In a series of wind-tunnel experiments conducted at the St. Anthony
   Falls Laboratory, a wind-turbine model was exposed to three different
   thermal regimes (neutral, weakly stable and weakly convective flows) in
   three simple arrangements relevant to wind-farm applications: single
   turbine in the boundary-layer, aligned turbine-turbine, and an upwind
   three-dimensional sinusoidal hill aligned with the turbine. Results
   focus on the spatial evolution of large-scale motions developing over
   the different thermal and topographic boundary conditions, and on their
   influence on the mean and fluctuating angular velocity of the turbine
   rotor. As compared to the single turbine case, both the upwind hill and
   turbine caused a reduction in the mean angular velocity regardless of
   the thermal regime; the turbine angular velocity fluctuations always
   decreased with a turbine upwind, which depleted the energy of the large
   structures of the flow; however such fluctuations decreased (increased)
   under stably stratified (convective) conditions when the hill was
   present. Pre-multiplied spectra of the rotor angular velocity and
   two-point correlation contours of the streamwise velocity component
   confirmed a non-trivial link between thermal stratification and terrain
   complexity. It is inferred that the thermal effects occurring in the
   three different boundary-layer regimes modulate the spanwise motion of
   the hill wake and define whether the hill shelters or exposes the
   turbine to enhanced large-scale energetic motions.}},

Title = {{Two dimensional size-mass distribution function inversion from

   measurements}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{92}},
Pages = {{70-82}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{We developed and applied a data inversion routine to determine the
   number based size-mass distribution function (the two dimensional
   distribution function) from tandem differential mobility
   analyzer-aerosol particle mass analyzer (DMA-APM) measurements. The two
   dimensional distribution function is expressed in units of particle
   number concentration per unit mobility diameter per unit particle mass.
   It can be used to directly calculate the number based size distribution
   (commonly determined using DMA measurements) or the mass based size
   distribution (commonly inferred from impactor measurements). The
   inversion routine utilizes the Twomey-Markowski algorithm and is applied
   in this study to DMA-APM measurements of sodium chloride, cesium iodide,
   and ammonium sulfate particles in the 30-200 nm mobility diameter range,
   as well as acetylene flame generated soot aggregates in the 40-350 nm
   range. To utilize the inversion routine, the APM transfer function must
   be known a priori. Here it is computed using a modified version of the
   Ehara (uniform flow) model, with a transmission correction factor
   inferred from measurements. For the three examined salt particle types,
   visual representation of the two dimensional distribution function
   reveals that at a given mobility diameter, particles have very narrow
   mass distributions, with the peak masses in good agreement with
   predictions based on bulk salt densities. However, for soot particles,
   extremely broad distributions are observed. Soot measurements are
   compared to predictions for quasifractal aggregates in the transition
   regime; this comparison suggests that aggregates with fractal dimensions
   ranging from 1.4 to 2.5 are all generated in the same system. Finally,
   we determine the two-dimensional distribution function for a mixture of
   ammonium sulfate and soot particles, demonstrating that these two
   particle populations are separable from one another via mobility-mass
   analysis. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{An experimental investigation into supercavity closure mechanisms}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{789}},
Pages = {{259-284}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Substantial discrepancy in the conditions for attainment of different
   closure modes of a ventilated supercavity has existed widely in the
   published literature. In this study, supercavity closure is investigated
   with an objective to understand the physical mechanisms determining
   closure formation and transition between different closure modes and to
   reconcile the observations from prior studies under various flow
   settings. The experiments are conducted in a closed-wall recirculating
   water tunnel to image ventilated supercavity closure using high speed
   and high-resolution photography and simultaneously measure pressure
   inside the cavity. The flow conditions arc varied systematically to
   cover a broad range of water velocity, ventilation flow rate and
   cavitator size, which correspond to different Froude numbers, air
   entrainment coefficients and blockage ratios, respectively. In addition
   to the classical closure modes reported in the literature (e.g.
   re-entrant jet, twin vortex, quad vortex, etc.), the study has revealed
   a number of new closure modes that occur during the transition between
   classical modes, or under very specific flow conditions. Closure maps
   arc constructed to depict the flow regimes, i.e. the range of Froude
   number and air entrainment coefficient., for various closure modes at
   different blockage ratios. From the closure map at each blockage ratio,
   a critical ventilation flow rate, below which the supercavity collapses
   into foamy cavity upon reduction of Froude number, is identified. The
   air entrainment coefficients corresponding to such critical ventilation
   rate are found to be independent of blockage ratio. It has been observed
   that in the process of generating a supercavity by increasing
   ventilation flow rate, the cavitation number gradually reduces to a
   minimum value and stays fixed upon further increments in the ventilation
   rate. Once a supercavity is formed, the ventilation rate can be
   decreased to a much lower value with no change in cavitation number
   while still maintaining a supercavity. This process is accompanied by a
   change in closure modes, which generally goes from twin vortex, to quad
   vortex, and then to re-entrant jet. In addition, the blockage effect is
   shown to play an important role in promoting the occurrence of
   twin-vortex closure modes. Subsequently, a physical framework governing
   the variation of different closure modes is proposed, and is used to
   explain mode transition upon the change of flow conditions, including
   the blockage effect. This framework is further extended to shed light on
   the occurrence of closure modes for ventilated supercavitation
   experiments across different types of flow facilities, the natural
   supercavity closure and the pulsating supercavity reported in the
   literature. Finally, in combination with a recent numerical study, our
   research discusses the role of the internal flow physics on the observed
   features during supercavity formation and closure-mode transition,
   paving the way for future investigations in this direction.}},

Pages = {{285-309}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The influence of insoluble surfactants on dynamic wetting failure during
   displacement of Newtonian fluids in a rectangular channel is studied in
   this work. A hydrodynamic model for steady Stokes flows of dilute
   surfactant solutions is developed and evaluated using three approaches:
   (i) a one-dimensional (1D) lubrication type approach, (ii) a novel
   hybrid of a 1D description of the receding phase and a 21) description
   of the advancing phase, and (iii) an asymptotic theory of Cox (J. Fluid
   Mech., vol. 168, 1986b, pp. 195-220). Steady-state solution families in
   the form of macroscopic contact angles as a function of the capillary
   number are determined and limit points are identified. When air is the
   receding fluid. Marangoni stresses are found to increase the
   receding-phase pressure gradients near the contact line by thinning the
   air film without significantly changing the capillary-pressure gradients
   there. As a consequence, the limit points shift to lower capillary
   numbers and the onset of wetting failure is promoted. The model
   predictions are then used to interpret decades-old experimental
   observations concerning the influence of surfactants on air entrainment
   (Burley \& Kennedy, Chem, Engng Sci., vol. 31, 1976, pp. 901-911). In
   addition to being a computationally efficient alternative for the
   rectangular geometries considered here, the hybrid modelling approach
   developed in this paper could also be applied to more complicated
   geometries where a thin air layer is present near a contact line.}},

Abstract = {{In the 20 years since its invention in Europe, cross-laminated timber
   (CLT) has become a widely used construction material in parts of the old
   continent and has started to attract global attention. CLT possesses
   numerous advantages as a construction material, including its superior
   structural and environmental performance, as well as the speed and
   efficiency with which CLT buildings can be erected. In this study,
   European engineers were surveyed to learn about their current level of
   awareness of CLT, the major barriers to CLT adoption, and about the most
   pressing research needs to advance the use of CLT as a construction
   material. The study used a web-based survey with a convenience sample of
   93 different kinds of timber and civil engineers and/or researchers,
   most of which belong to a European CLT research network. Results showed
   that participants think that, in general, the level of awareness about
   CLT among developers, construction managers, engineers, architects, and
   construction managers, is low. The majority of perceived barriers for
   CLT adoption involved its building code compatibility and the
   availability of technical information. The most pressing research needs
   for CLT development, according to respondents, are in the areas of
   structural performance and connections, moisture performance, and market
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The unique physico-chemical properties of silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs)
   have opened up the opportunity for their use in many promising
   physicochemical and biomedical applications. In this study, an
   economically feasible approach to green synthesis of silver
   nanoparticles (Ag NPs) is described using hemicellulose from bamboo.
   Simultaneously, glucose was used as the reducing agent, and distilled
   water was used as the reaction medium. UV-vis spectroscopy and
   transmission electron microscopy were used to investigate the surface
   plasmon behavior, morphology, and particle size of the Ag NPs.
   Hemicellulose alone could not reduce Ag+ to Ag-0. The formation rate of
   the nanoparticles was accelerated when high amounts of glucose were
   added. Small particle sizes were obtained when high concentrations of
   hemicellulose were used. The stability of the Ag NPs synthesized using
   different concentrations of hemicellulose from 0.5 mg/mL to 8.0 mg/mL
   was also evaluated. Higher initial hemicellulose concentrations produced
   more stable Ag NPs. The average particle sizes of the NPs after storing
   for 160 days at 4 degrees C were still smaller than 10 nm when the
   initial hemicellulose concentrations were 6.0 and 8.0 mg/mL.}},

Abstract = {{Whole cell biocatalysts for biodiesel production have garnered
   significant attention in recent years, as they can help avoid the
   complex procedures of isolation, purification, and immobilization of
   extracellular lipase. Because of its renewability and biodegradability,
   loofah (Luffa cylindrica) sponge is an advantageous substitute for
   traditional biomass carriers in whole cell immobilization. Rhizopus
   oryzae mycelia can spontaneously attach onto loofah sponge particles
   (LSPs) during cell cultivation. The highest immobilized R. oryzae cells
   concentration can reach up to 1.40 g/1 g of LSPs. The effects of
   biocatalyst addition and water content on methanolysis for biodiesel
   production were investigated in this paper. The operational stability of
   glutaraldehyde-treated biocatalyst at 35 degrees C, using a 1: 1
   oil-to-methanol ratio, was assayed, revealing a 3.4-fold increase in
   half-life compared with the untreated biocatalyst. Under optimized
   conditions, the yield of methyl esters in the reaction mixture reached
   82.2\% to 92.2\% in each cycle. These results suggested that loofah
   sponge is a potential fungi carrier for an immobilized whole-cell
   biocatalyst.}},

Abstract = {{A prototype 4 kW solar thermochemical reactor for the continuous

   demonstrated. These first tests of the new reactor showcase both the
   innovation of continuous on-sun fuel production in a single reactor and
   remarkably effective heat recovery of the sensible heat of the reactant
   and product gases. The impact of selection of gas flow rates is explored
   with respect to reactor fuel productivity and external energy costs of
   gas separation and pumping. Thermal impacts of gas flow selection are
   explored by coupling measured temperatures with a computational fluid
   dynamics (CFD) model to calculate internal temperature distributions and
   estimate heat recovery. Optimized gas flows selected for operation
   provide a 75\% increase in fuel productivity and reduction in parasitic
   energy costs by 10\% with respect to the design case.}},

   of cross-sectional area has no significant impact on the effectiveness
   of the manifold. In comparison to a rigid porous manifold, the
   performance of the flexible manifold is slightly worse because the

Abstract = {{Hot carrier generation in silicon (Si) quantum dots (QDs) is studied

   theoretical fitting to the CWPL spectra of the Si QDs. As a fitting
   parameter, the excited carrier temperature was calculated. A
   steady-state carrier population was revealed with a temperature 500 K
   above room temperature under illumination equivalent to one standard sun
   (100 mW/cm(2)). In addition, since the carrier temperature increased
   with the power of illumination, a state filling effect is proposed as a
   reasonable cause for the elevated carrier temperature by comparative
   study of the CWPL spectra of Si QDs with three different sizes. These Si
   QDs show great potential for one of the steps towards a practical hot
   carrier solar cell (HCSC) device as high carrier temperatures can be

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{161}},
Pages = {{10-16}},

Abstract = {{Conventional in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables the
   atomic-scale study of dynamic materials processes on millisecond time
   scales. Specimen holders capable of being heated to over 1000 degrees C
   have provided insight into myriad processes, including nanoscale thermal
   transport, structural phase transitions, and catalytic reactions. In
   order for such studies to be accurate and precise, direct determination
   of the specimen temperature - rather than the heating-element
   temperature - is critical. Further, such methods should be versatile in
   that any temperature across a wide range may be measured, irrespective
   of single-indicator properties specific to the specimen (e.g.,
   first-order phase transition, melting point, etc.). Here, we describe a
   rigorous approach to direct, in situ thermometry of TEM specimens that
   exploits lattice thermal expansion and the resultant decrease in
   diffraction-vector magnitude in reciprocal space. Via sub-pixel
   measurement of reciprocal-lattice-vector magnitudes, picometer increases
   in lattice parameters are measured over a continuous temperature range
   and compared to those expected from the coefficient of thermal
   expansion. Statistical treatment of several experimental trials
   conducted on nanostructured aluminum thin films shows excellent
   agreement with both theory and (indirect) measurement of the in situ
   heating holder. Additionally, we illustrate how uncontrolled,
   thermally-induced variation in single-crystal orientation leads to
   modulation of the excitation error and, therefore, the Bragg-spot
   intensities resulting in a convolution of heating and tilting effects,
   thus complicating temperature determination via the Debye-Waller effect.

Abstract = {{This study demonstrated that the limiting factor to algae growth on
   dairy wastewater was the ammonia nitrogen deficiency. Dairy wastewaters
   were mixed with a slaughterhouse wastewater that has much higher ammonia
   nitrogen content. The results showed the mixing wastewaters improved the
   nutrient profiles and biomass yield at low cost. Algae grown on mixed
   wastewaters contained high protein (55.98-66.91\%) and oil content
   (19.10-20.81\%) and can be exploited to produce animal feed and biofuel.
   Furthermore, algae grown on mixed wastewater significantly reduced
   nutrient contents remained in the wastewater after treatment. By
   mitigating limiting factor to algae growth on dairy wastewaters, the key
   issue of low biomass yield of algae grown on dairy wastewaters was
   resolved and the wastewater nutrient removal efficiency was
   significantly improved by this study. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A series of experiments were completed to investigate the interactions
   between relatively large-scale sediment dunes and axial flow
   hydrokinetic turbines. Baseline experiments were completed under clear
   water conditions to assess local scour impacts of single and two-turbine
   installations. Spatio-temporal measurements of bed elevation were
   obtained simultaneously with turbine voltage output, from which a
   measure of the instantaneous rotor angular velocity was used as a proxy
   for turbine response to unsteady loads. These experiments were completed
   in a mobile bed of 1.8 mm coarse sand with migrating bedforms. A bedform
   tracking routine was used to analyze streamwise bed elevation profiles
   to estimate bedform geometric characteristics and their corresponding
   impact on turbine performance. Cross-correlation analysis was also
   performed, investigating critical relationships between approaching
   bedform crest location, height and the corresponding turbine voltage
   output In parallel with the analysis on bedform effects on turbine
   performance, an extended region downstream of the rotor location was
   analyzed to investigate how bedform geometric characteristics changed
   along the channel after turbine deployment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Atmospheric nucleation fromsulfuric acid depends on the concentrations
   and the stabilizing effect of other trace gases, such as ammonia and
   amines. Diamines are an understudied class of atmospherically relevant
   compounds, and we examine how they affect sulfuric acid nucleation in
   both flow reactor experiments and the atmosphere. The number of
   particles produced fromsulfuric acid and diamines in the flow reactor
   was equal to or greater than the number formed from monoamines, implying
   that diamines are more effective nucleating agents. Upper limits of
   diamine abundance were also monitored during three field campaigns:
   Lamont, OK (2013); Lewes, DE (2012); and Atlanta, GA (2009). Mixing
   ratios were measured as high as tens of parts per trillion by volume (GA
   and OK). Laboratory results suggest that diamines at these levels are
   important for atmospheric nucleation. Diamines likely participate in
   atmospheric nucleation and should be considered in nucleation
   measurements and models.}},

Abstract = {{We present here a broadband, wide-angle, and polarization-independent
   nearly perfect absorber consisting of mirror-backed nanoporous alumina.
   By electrochemically anodizing the disordered multicomponent aluminum
   and properly tailoring the thickness and air-filling fraction of
   nanoporous alumina, according to the Maxwell-Garnet mixture theory, a
   large-area dark alumina can be made with excellent photothermal
   properties and absorption larger than 93\% over a wide wavelength range
   spanning from near-infrared to ultraviolet light, i.e. 250 nm-2500 nm.
   The measured absorption is orders of magnitude greater than other
   reported anodized porous alumina, typically semi-transparent at similar
   wavelengths. This simple yet effective approach, however, does not
   require any lithography, nano-mixture deposition, pre- and
   post-treatment. Here, we also envisage and theoretically investigate the
   practical use of proposed absorbers and/or photothermal converters in
   integrated thermoelectronic and/or thermophotovoltaic energy conversion
   devices, which make efficient use of the entire spectrum of ambient
   visible to near-infrared radiation.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{510}},

Abstract = {{High aromatics yield (> 90\%, benzene and toluene) was obtained from
   vapor phase hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenolic compound mixtures
   containing m-cresol, anisole, 1,2-dimethoxybenzene, and guaiacol over
   molybdenum carbide catalysts (Mo2C) under atmospheric pressure at
   533-553 K, even with H-2 to phenolic compound molar ratios of similar to
   3,300. Toluene selectivity increased proportionately (4\%-66\%) to
   m-cresol content in HDO of phenolic compound mixtures (molar
   composition: 0\%-70\%) at quantitative conversion. Phenol selectivity
   increased with decreasing conversion, implying that the aryl-methoxyl
   bond in guaiacol is cleaved first, before the aryl-hydroxyl bond. Low
   selectivity to cyclohexane and methylcyclohexane (< 10\%) across the
   conversions investigated (18-94\%) demonstrates that undesired
   successive hydrogenation reactions of aromatics over Mo2C were
   inhibited, presumably due to in situ oxygen modification, as inferred
   from titration studies of aromatic hydrogenation reactions using
   methanol and water as titrants. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   mg/g-chabazite, and the maximum sorption capacity at room temperature
   was 34.2 mg/g-chabazite. Thermodynamic parameters indicated the
   spontaneity and exothermic nature of the sorption. Chabazite sorption
   decreased soluble phosphorus, possibly by forming insoluble calcium
   phosphate. This study demonstrated that chabazite sorbent was effective
   for ammonium separation from liquid swine manure, and the resulting
   sorbent may be used as slow-release nitrogen fertilizer.}},

Abstract = {{Two-dimensional (2D) ultra-high carrier densities are of considerable
   current research interest for novel plasmonic and high charge-gain

   limited to 3 x 10(14) cm(-2) (1/2 electron/unit cell/interface) at
   GdTiO3/SrTiO3 interfaces, and is typically an order of magnitude lower
   at LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interfaces. We show from experiment and modeling that
   carrier densities much higher than expected based on resolution of the
   polar discontinuity at perovskite oxide heterojunctions can be achieved
   via band engineering. The SrTiO3 (8 u.c.)/NdTiO3 (t u.c) /SrTiO3 (8
   u.c.) /LSAT(001) heterostructure shows the expected electronic
   reconstruction behavior starting at t = 2 u.c., but then exhibits a

Abstract = {{Mechanically driven light emission from particles embedded in elastomer
   films has recently attracted interest as a strong candidate for
   next-generation light sources on display devices because it is
   nondestructive, reproducible, real-time, environmentally friendly, and
   reliable. The origin of mechanoluminescence (ML) obtained from particles
   embedded in elastomer films have been proposed as the trapping of
   drifting charge carriers in the presence of a piezoelectric field.
   However, in this study, we propose a new origin of ML through the study
   of the microstructure of a Cu-doped ZnS particles embedded in an
   elastomer composite film with high brightness using transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) to clearly demonstrate the origin of ML with
   respect to the microstructure of ML composite films. The TEM
   characterization of the ML composite film demonstrated that the Cu-doped
   ZnS particles were fully encapsulated by a 500 nm thick Al layer, which
   acts as an electron source for ML emission. Furthermore, we fabricated a
   flexible electro-mechanoluminescence (EML) device using a Cu-doped ZnS
   particles embedded in a flexible elastomer composite film. Our research
   results on a new emission mechanism for ML and its application in
   flexible light generating elastomer films represent an important step
   toward environmentally benign and ecofriendly flexible
   electro-mechanoluminescent lighting devices.}},

Title = {{Mechanism of imidazolium ionic liquids toxicity in Saccharomyces
   cerevisiae and rational engineering of a tolerant, xylose-fermenting
   strain}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JAN 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Imidazolium ionic liquids (IILs) underpin promising
   technologies that generate fermentable sugars from lignocellulose for
   future biorefineries. However, residual IILs are toxic to fermentative
   microbes such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, making IIL-tolerance a key
   property for strain engineering. To enable rational engineering, we used
   chemical genomic profiling to understand the effects of IILs on S.
   cerevisiae.
   Results: We found that IILs likely target mitochondria as their chemical
   genomic profiles closely resembled that of the mitochondrial membrane
   disrupting agent valinomycin. Further, several deletions of genes
   encoding mitochondrial proteins exhibited increased sensitivity to IIL.
   High-throughput chemical proteomics confirmed effects of IILs on
   mitochondrial protein levels. IILs induced abnormal mitochondrial
   morphology, as well as altered polarization of mitochondrial membrane
   potential similar to valinomycin. Deletion of the putative
   serine/threonine kinase PTK2 thought to activate the plasma-membrane
   proton efflux pump Pma1p conferred a significant IIL-fitness advantage.
   Conversely, overexpression of PMA1 conferred sensitivity to IILs,
   suggesting that hydrogen ion efflux may be coupled to influx of the
   toxic imidazolium cation. PTK2 deletion conferred resistance to multiple
   IILs, including {[}EMIM]Cl, {[}BMIM]Cl, and {[}EMIM]Ac. An engineered,
   xylose-converting ptk2 Delta S. cerevisiae (Y133-IIL) strain consumed
   glucose and xylose faster and produced more ethanol in the presence of 1
   \% {[}BMIM]Cl than the wild-type PTK2 strain. We propose a model of IIL
   toxicity and resistance.
   Conclusions: This work demonstrates the utility of chemical
   genomics-guided biodesign for development of superior microbial
   biocatalysts for the ever-changing landscape of fermentation inhibitors.}},

Title = {{Differentiation of Human Induced-Pluripotent Stem Cells into
   Smooth-Muscle Cells: Two Novel Protocols}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Conventional protocols for differentiating human induced-pluripotent
   stem cells (hiPSCs) into smooth-muscle cells (SMCs) can be inefficient
   and generally fail to yield cells with a specific SMC phenotype (i.e.,
   contractile or synthetic SMCs). Here, we present two novel hiPSC-SMC
   differentiation protocols that yield SMCs with predominantly contractile
   or synthetic phenotypes. Flow cytometry analyses of smooth-muscle actin
   (SMA) expression indicated that similar to 45\% of the cells obtained
   with each protocol assumed an SMC phenotype, and that the populations
   could be purified to similar to 95\% via metabolic selection.
   Assessments of cellular mRNA and/or protein levels indicated that SMA,
   myosin heavy chain II, collagen 1, calponin, transgelin, connexin 43,
   and vimentin expression in the SMCs obtained via the Contractile SMC
   protocol and in SMCs differentiated via a traditional protocol were
   similar, while SMCs produced via the Sythetic SMC protocol expressed
   less calponin, more collagen 1, and more connexin 43. Differences were
   also observed in functional assessments of the two SMC populations: the
   two-dimensional surface area of Contractile SMCs declined more
   extensively (to 12\% versus 44\% of original size) in response to
   carbachol treatment, while quantification of cell migration and
   proliferation were greater in Synthetic SMCs. Collectively, these data
   demonstrate that our novel differentiation protocols can efficiently
   generate SMCs from hiPSCs.}},

Abstract = {{The microstructure and mechanical properties of a block copolymer
   modified commercial thermoset plastic formed from a bisphenol-A based
   epoxy and a bio-derived amine hardener (Cardolite VR NC-541LV) were
   investigated. A series of poly(ethylene oxide)-b-poly(butylene oxide)
   (PEO-PBO) diblock copolymers was synthesized at fixed composition
   (31+/-1\% by volume PEO) and varying molecular weight expanding on a
   commercially available PEO-PBO compound marketed by the Dow Chemical
   Company under the trade name FORTEGRA (TM) 100; direct application of
   any of these block copolymers resulted in little improvement of the poor
   fracture toughness of the cured material. Modification of the resin
   formulation and curing protocol led to the development of well-defined
   spherical and branched worm-like micelles containing a PBO core and PEO
   corona in the cross-linked products as evidenced by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS)
   measurements. Maximum fracture toughness (K-1c) and a ninefold increase
   in the critical strain energy release rate (G(1c)) over the unmodified
   neat epoxy was achieved at 5 wt \% loading of intermediate molecular
   weight PEO-PBO, without measureable reductions in modulus, glass
   transition temperature or transparency. This study provides new
   strategies for engineering improved performance in thermoset materials
   using block copolymer additives that exhibit challenging mixing
   thermodynamic characteristics with the component monomers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Obtaining knowledge of the mutual miscibility of alkanes, surfactants,
   and water over a wide range of temperatures and pressures is of great
   relevance for the energy industry. Molecular simulations using advanced
   sampling techniques and transferable force fields can serve as a
   predictive method to study a variety of phase equilibria at different
   temperatures, pressures, and overall compositions. In this work,
   configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the NpT Gibbs ensemble
   with the Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria (TraPPE) force
   field are applied to investigate the binary mixture of n-dodecane and
   ethanol at pressures of 0.1 and 100 MPa and the ternary mixture of these
   compounds with water at one state point. The simulations qualitatively
   reproduce the increase of the upper critical solution temperature (UCST)
   with increasing pressure, but the miscibility gap is overestimated at
   both pressures and the UCSTs are shifted up by about 50K compared to the
   experimental values. The TraPPE model correctly shows a gradual decrease
   for the ethanol solubility in the n-dodecane-rich phase upon addition of
   water to the mixture. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) with floating gates (FGs) are an
   emerging platform for label-free electronic biodetection. Advantages of
   floating gate EGTs (FG-EGTs) include signal amplification and inherent
   sensitivity to small voltages, on the order of 10 mV, associated with
   chemical binding events on the floating gate electrode surface. Here we
   examine how the performance of these devices depends on their
   architecture, specifically the relative sizes (areas) of the control
   gate, the floating gate, and the sourcesemiconductordrain channel. The
   results allow optimization of the geometry for future biodetection
   studies. Further, using self-assembled monolayer (SAM) chemistry, we
   also examine the effect of chemisorption on the floating gate on the
   current voltage (I-V) characteristics. We find the FG-EGTs respond to
   both interfacial dipoles and capacitance changes and that the I-V
   behavior can be reasonably predicted with a lumped capacitor model.
   Overall, this work provides the most detailed picture to date of the
   operating mechanism of these promising electronic sensing devices.}},

Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{621-630}},

Abstract = {{Among the numerous point vapor sources, microsecond-pulsed spark
   ablation at atmospheric pressure is a versatile and environmentally
   friendly method for producing ultrapure inorganic nanoparticles ranging
   from singlets having sizes smaller than 1 nm to larger agglomerated
   structures. Due to its fast quenching and extremely high
   supersaturation, coagulational growth already begins at the atomic scale
   at room temperature. On the basis of this knowledge, we develop a simple
   semiempirical yet versatile model for predicting the size distribution
   of singlet particles as a function of the process conditions. The model
   assumes that a plume of a turbulent aerosol flow flares out from a
   concentrated point source, eventually reaching the walls of the
   confinement where a fraction of the particles is deposited. Despite the
   complexity of the entire process, the concentration and size evolution
   of particles can be adequately described by a first-order differential
   equation accounting for coagulation, turbulent dilution, and diffusional
   deposition to the walls. The model provides a simple and practical tool
   that can generally be used to design and control point vapor source
   reactors for the synthesis of singlets with tunable sizes starting from
   that of single atoms.}},

Abstract = {{Melt-blown fibers (d(av) similar to 1 mu m) were produced from blends of
   poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) and a partially fluorinated random
   multiblock copolyester (PFCE) leading to enhanced hydrophobicity and
   even superhydrophobicity (static water contact angle = 157 +/- 3
   degrees) of the associated fiber mats. XPS measurements demonstrated
   quantitatively that the surface fluorine content increased
   systematically with the bulk loading of PFCE, rising to nearly 20 atom
   \%, which corresponds to 41 wt \% PFCE at a bulk loading of 10 wt \%.
   The PBT/PFCE fibers exhibit greater fluorine surface segregation than
   either melt-blown PBT/poly(ethylene-co-chlorotrifluoroethylene)
   (PBT/PECTFE) fibers or electrospun fibers obtained from blends of
   poly(styrene) and fluoroalkyl end-capped polystyrene (PS/PSCF). Dynamic
   contact angle measurements further demonstrated decreased surface
   adhesion energy of the melt-blown PBT/PFCE fiber mats due to the
   blooming of PFCE to the surface.}},

Title = {{Toward Bioremediation of Methylmercury Using Silica Encapsulated
   Escherichia coli Harboring the mer Operon}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal and the ability of the neurotoxin
   methylmercury to bio-magnify in the food chain is a serious concern for
   both public and environmental health globally. Because thousands of tons
   of mercury are released into the environment each year, remediation
   strategies are urgently needed and prompted this study. To facilitate
   remediation of both organic and inorganic forms of mercury, Escherichia
   coli was engineered to harbor a subset of genes (merRTPAB) from the
   mercury resistance operon. Protein products of the mer operon enable
   transport of mercury into the cell, cleavage of organic C-Hg bonds, and
   subsequent reduction of ionic mercury to the less toxic elemental form,
   Hg(0). E. coli containing merRTPAB was then encapsulated in silica beads
   resulting in a biological-based filtration material. Performing
   encapsulation in aerated mineral oil yielded silica beads that were
   smooth, spherical, and similar in diameter. Following encapsulation, E.
   coli containing merRTPAB retained the ability to degrade methylmercury
   and performed similarly to non-encapsulated cells. Due to the
   versatility of both the engineered mercury resistant strain and silica
   bead technology, this study provides a strong foundation for use of the
   resulting biological-based filtration material for methylmercury
   remediation.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN 11}},
Abstract = {{Nonlocal spin valves (NLSVs) generate pure spin currents, providing
   unique insight into spin injection and relaxation at the nanoscale.
   Recently it was shown that the puzzling low temperature nonmonotonicity
   of the spin accumulation in all-metal NLSVs occurs due to a
   manifestation of the Kondo effect arising from dilute
   local-moment-forming impurities in the nonmagnetic material. Here it is
   demonstrated that precise control over interdiffusion in Fe/Cu NLSVs via
   thermal annealing can induce dramatic increases in this Kondo
   suppression of injection efficiency, observation of injector/detector
   separation-dependent Kondo effects in both charge and spin channels
   simultaneously, and, in the limit of large interdiffusion, complete
   breakdown of standard Valet-Fert-based models. The Kondo effect in the
   charge channel enables extraction of the exact interdiffusion profile,
   quantifying the influence of local moment density on the injection
   efficiency and presenting a well-posed challenge to theory.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the effects of parameter uncertainty on the optimal
   radiation schedule in the context of the linear-quadratic model. Our
   interest arises from the observation that if inter-patient variability
   in normal and tumor tissue radiosensitivity or sparing factor of the
   organs-at-risk (OAR) are not accounted for during radiation scheduling,
   the performance of the therapy may be strongly degraded or the OAR may
   receive a substantially larger dose than the allowable threshold. This
   paper proposes a stochastic radiation scheduling concept to incorporate
   inter-patient variability into the scheduling optimization problem. Our
   method is based on a probabilistic approach, where the model parameters
   are given by a set of random variables. Our probabilistic formulation
   ensures that our constraints are satisfied with a given probability, and
   that our objective function achieves a desired level with a stated
   probability. We used a variable transformation to reduce the resulting
   optimization problem to two dimensions. We showed that the optimal
   solution lies on the boundary of the feasible region and we implemented
   a branch and bound algorithm to find the global optimal solution. We
   demonstrated how the configuration of optimal schedules in the presence
   of uncertainty compares to optimal schedules in the absence of
   uncertainty (conventional schedule). We observed that in order to
   protect against the possibility of the model parameters falling into a
   region where the conventional schedule is no longer feasible, it is
   required to avoid extremal solutions, i.e. a single large dose or very
   large total dose delivered over a long period. Finally, we performed
   numerical experiments in the setting of head and neck tumors including
   several normal tissues to reveal the effect of parameter uncertainty on
   optimal schedules and to evaluate the sensitivity of the solutions to
   the choice of key model parameters.}},

Title = {{Integrating Insults: Using Fault Tree Analysis to Guide Schizophrenia
   Research across Levels of Analysis}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{The grand challenges of schizophrenia research are linking the causes of
   the disorder to its symptoms and finding ways to overcome those
   symptoms. We argue that the field will be unable to address these
   challenges within psychiatry's standard neo-Kraepelinian (DSM)
   perspective. At the same time the current corrective, based in molecular
   genetics and cognitive neuroscience, is also likely to flounder due to
   its neglect for psychiatry's syndromal structure. We suggest adopting a
   new approach long used in reliability engineering, which also serves as
   a synthesis of these approaches. This approach, known as fault tree
   analysis, can be combined with extant neuroscientific data collection
   and computational modeling efforts to uncover the causal structures
   underlying the cognitive and affective failures in people with
   schizophrenia as well as other complex psychiatric phenomena. By making
   explicit how causes combine from basic faults to downstream failures,
   this approach makes affordances for: (1) causes that are neither
   necessary nor sufficient in and of themselves; (2) within-diagnosis
   heterogeneity; and (3) between diagnosis co-morbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) has witnessed a rapid growth over the
   past decade, providing a variety of automated tools for the analysis of
   medical images. In surgical pathology, such tools enhance the diagnosing
   capabilities of pathologists by allowing them to review and diagnose a
   larger number of cases daily. Geared towards developing such tools, the
   main goal of this paper is to identify useful computer vision based
   feature descriptors for recognizing cancerous tissues in histopathologic
   images. To this end, we use images of Hematoxylin \& Eosin-stained
   microscopic sections of breast and prostate carcinomas, and myometrial
   leiomyosarcomas, and provide an exhaustive evaluation of several state
   of the art feature representations for this task. Among the various
   image descriptors that we chose to compare, including representations
   based on convolutional neural networks, Fisher vectors, and sparse
   codes, we found that working with covariance based descriptors shows
   superior performance on all three types of cancer considered. While
   covariance descriptors are known to be effective for texture
   recognition, it is the first time that they are demonstrated to be
   useful for the proposed task and evaluated against deep learning models.
   Capitalizing on Region Covariance Descriptors (RCDs), we derive a
   powerful image descriptor for cancerous tissue recognition termed,
   Covariance Kernel Descriptor (CKD), which consistently outperformed all
   the considered image representations. Our experiments show that using
   CKD lead to 92.83\%, 91.51\%, and 98.10\% classification accuracy for
   the recognition of breast carcinomas, prostate carcinomas, and
   myometrial leiomyosarcomas, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Free carrier generation due to the presence of absorbing contaminants is
   considered as a primary mechanism for initiating continuous-wave laser
   damage in low absorption, high bandgap optical coatings. Thermal,
   optical, and ion-generation are examined as means of exciting electrons
   above the bandgap of the material. Once electrons exist above the
   bandgap, they absorb incident light, causing a runway thermal-absorption
   process leading to material breakdown. Testing this theory, high
   reflectivity distributed Bragg reflectors and half-wave coatings were
   tested with a 17kW 1070nm continuous wave laser in the presence of
   carbon contamination. Damage thresholds of titania, tantala, hafnia,
   alumina, and silica were compared to theory and found to follow similar
   trends. In an effort to prevent laser damage, samples were conditioned
   using lower irradiance levels, prior to higher exposure. This was found
   to reduce absorption by up to 90\% as well as increase damage thresholds
   by over an order of magnitude for some samples.}},

Abstract = {{Transdermal drug delivery is an important approach due to its advantages
   of controlled release, easy wiping off, high safety and low degree of
   side effects. However, the efficiency and success of the drug delivery
   method is seriously hampered by the incapacity of many drugs to cross
   the skin at therapeutically useful rates. A microneedle approach can
   dramatically promote transdermal delivery, especially for
   macromolecules. In this paper, a fabrication process for hollow hafnium
   oxide microneedles on silicon wafer using only one mask has been
   developed. Photoresist is spun on a 4{''} silicon (100) wafer and
   patterned by a mask. Deep reactive ion etching is used to form deep
   molds inside the wafer. A hafnium oxide film is deposited by atomic
   layer deposition to cover the top side of the wafer and the inside walls
   of the molds. Then the back side of silicon wafer is etched by a 30
   wt.\% KOH solution until exposed hollow hafnium oxide microneedles are
   obtained. Compared to the processes that have been developed for
   silicon, silicon oxide, or polymer microneedles, the process presented
   here is simpler, and the strength and flexibility of hollow hafnium
   oxide microneedles can be easily adjusted by modifying the depositing
   time of hafnium oxide films. Hafnium oxide microneedles have potential
   applications in transdermal drug delivery.}},

Abstract = {{This work addresses the introduction of renewable ammonia plants with
   hydrogen obtained from wind-powered electrolysis into a region's ammonia
   supply chain. A supply chain optimization problem is fomulated to decide
   where to build new renewable plants, how large they should be and how
   much ammonia should be transported between conventional plants,
   renewable plants, distribution centers, and demand centers to meet local
   demand. A multiobjective optimization problem is also formulated to
   analyze tradeoffs between economic and environmental objectives. The
   developed framework is applied to a case study in Minnesota utilizing
   cost data from a pilot renewable plant in Morris, MN. The base case
   establishes that it is economically optimal to build a single new
   renewable plant that supplies 27\% of the state's ammonia. New renewable
   plants are selected for construction in 48\% of Monte Carlo trials. A
   carbon tax analysis is also performed to analyze the carbon emissions of
   the supply chain. The analysis shows that a modest carbon tax of just
   \$35/t cuts emissions by 65\% and promotes the construction of 3 new
   renewable plants.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic computing using simple logic circuits requires significantly
   less area and consumes less power compared to traditional computing
   systems. These circuits are also inherently fault-tolerant. The main
   drawbacks of these systems include long latency and inexactness in
   computing. The deviation from exact values increases as the correlation
   among inputs increases. In many applications, outputs from different
   sensors may be correlated. Thus, testing correctness of stochastic
   computing circuits requires generation of correlated stochastic bit
   streams. While uncorrelated bit streams can be generated using linear
   feedback shift registers (LFSRs), generation of correlated stochastic
   bit streams has not yet been fully investigated. This paper presents a
   general approach to synthesize correlated stochastic bit streams for
   specified probabilities and specified correlation coefficients.
   Generation of N correlated stochastic bit streams requires N
   probabilities and 2 N-N-1 correlation coefficients. Using N LFSRs, N
   uncorrelated stochastic bit streams are first generated. The N
   correlated bit streams are then generated one at a time using
   conditional marginal probabilities. The method is illustrated for
   generating two and three correlated bit streams. The area and power
   overheads for two correlated bit streams are 9.09\% and 2.12\%,
   respectively, and for three correlated bit streams are 21.03\% and
   4.80\%, respectively. The generated sequences are applied to simple
   stochastic logic gates and the probability density functions (pdfs) of
   the outputs are derived. It is shown that these match with the
   theoretical pdfs of the outputs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel patient-specific algorithm for prediction of
   seizures in epileptic patients. Spectral power features, including
   relative spectral powers and spectral power ratios, and cross
   correlation coefficients between all pairs of electrodes, are extracted
   as two independent feature sets. Both feature sets are selected
   independently in a patient-specific manner by classification and
   regression tree (CART). Selected features are further processed by a
   second-order Kalman filter and then input independently to three
   different classifiers which include AdaBoost, radial basis function
   kernel support vector machine (RBF-SVM) and artificial neural network
   (ANN). The algorithm is tested on the intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) from the
   recent American Epilepsy Society Seizure Prediction Challenge database.
   Intracranial EEG was recorded from five dogs and two patients. These
   datasets have varying numbers of electrodes and are sampled at different
   sampling frequencies. It is shown that the spectral feature set achieves
   a mean AUC of 0.7538, 0.7739, and 0.7948 for AdaBoost, SVM, and ANN,
   respectively. The correlation coefficients feature set achieves a mean
   AUC of 0.6640, 0.7403, and 0.7875 for AdaBoost, SVM, and ANN,
   respectively. The combined best results which use patient-specific
   feature sets achieve a mean AUC of 0.7603, 0.8472, and 0.8884 for
   AdaBoost, SVM, and ANN, respectively.}},

   a general unipolar division. Second, we present two approaches to
   computing tangent hyperbolic and sigmoid functions in bipolar stochastic
   logic. The first approach involves format conversion from bipolar format
   to unipolar format. The second approach uses a general bipolar

Abstract = {{Factorization of a single matrix or tensor has been used widely to
   reveal interpretable factors or predict missing data. However, in many
   cases side information may be available, such as social network
   activities and user demographic data together with Netflix data. In
   these situations, coupled matrix tensor factorization (CMTF) can be
   employed to account for additional sources of information. When the side
   information comes in the form of item-correlation matrices of certain
   modes, existing CMTF algorithms do not apply. Instead, a novel approach
   to model the correlation matrices is proposed here, using symmetric
   nonnegative matrix factorization. The multiple sources of information
   are fused by fitting outer-product models for the tensor and the
   correlation matrices in a coupled manner. The proposed model has the
   potential to overcome practical challenges, such as missing slabs from
   the tensor and/or missing rows/columns from the correlation matrices.}},

   distributed memory linear-systems solvers (Cluster-MKL-Pardiso and
   MUMPS), as well as our own applicationspecific domain-decomposition MPI
   solver, for a collection of 3-dimensional finite-element systems. We

   studied in the context of parallel computing. In this work, we study
   three optimization algorithms that have been successfully applied to
   tensor completion: alternating least squares (ALS), stochastic gradient
   descent (SGD), and coordinate descent (CCD++). We explore opportunities
   for parallelism on shared-and distributed-memory systems and address
   challenges such as memory-and operation-efficiency, load balance, cache
   locality, and communication. Among our advancements are an SGD algorithm
   which combines stratification with asynchronous communication, an ALS
   algorithm rich in level-3 BLAS routines, and a communication-efficient
   CCD++ algorithm. We evaluate our optimizations on a variety of real
   datasets using a modern supercomputer and demonstrate speedups through
   1024 cores. These improvements effectively reduce time-to-solution from
   hours to seconds on real-world datasets. We show that after our
   optimizations, ALS is advantageous on parallel systems of
   small-to-moderate scale, while both ALS and CCD++ will provide the
   lowest time-to-solution on large-scale distributed systems.}},

Abstract = {{This note deals with H-infinity observer design for Lipschitz nonlinear
   systems. Thanks to a new and judicious use of the Young's relation, new
   and less conservative LMI conditions are proposed to solve the problem
   of observer design. Two LMI design methods are provided. First, we
   propose a new enhanced LMI technique that allows to improve the standard
   LMI methods for Lipschitz systems. A second method is proposed to
   improve more the first one. It consists in combining the first method
   and the well known LPV approach. This technique exploits the advantages
   of the LPV approach for larger Lipschitz constants and in the second
   time, it allows to reduce the high number of LMIs of the classical LPV
   method. An application to a neural mass model is presented to show the
   effectiveness of the proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents GeoTrend; a system for scalable support of spatial
   trend discovery on recent microblogs, e.g., tweets and online reviews,
   that come in real time. GeoTrend is distinguished from existing
   techniques in three aspects: (1) It discovers trends in arbitrary
   spatial regions, e.g., city blocks. (2) It supports trending measures
   that effectively capture trending items under a variety of definitions
   that suit different applications. (3) It promotes recent microblogs as
   first-class citizens and optimizes its system components to digest a
   continuous flow of fast data in main-memory while removing old data
   efficiently. GeoTrend queries are top-k queries that discover the most
   trending k keywords that are posted within an arbitrary spatial region
   and during the last T time units. To support its queries efficiently,
   GeoTrend employs an in-memory spatial index that is able to efficiently
   digest incoming data and expire data that is beyond the last T time
   units. The index also materializes top-k keywords in different spatial
   regions so that incoming queries can be processed with low latency. In
   case of peak times, a main-memory optimization technique is employed to
   shed less important data, so that the system still sustains high query
   accuracy with limited memory resources. Experimental results based on
   real Twitter feed and Bing Mobile spatial search queries show the
   scalability of GeoTrend to support arrival rates of up to 50,000
   microblog/second, average query latency of 3 milli-seconds, and at least
   90+\% query accuracy even under limited memory resources.}},

Abstract = {{This paper discusses a dynamic observability analysis for attitude,
   angular velocity, shape, and surface parameters of Space Objects (SOs)
   using non-resolved images or light curve measurements. The Fisher
   information matrix and Cramer-Rao lower bound are introduced for
   calculating the observability of parameters used in SO models. Light
   curve measurements are known to be functions of SO rotational states,
   shape geometry, and surface parameters. This dependency is captured in
   the bidirectional reflectance distribution functions models. The
   rotational dynamics of SOs can be difficult to model due to the fact
   that external and/or control torques are unknown. This work assumes that
   these torques are known, and under this assumption dynamic observability
   is analyzed. An illustrative two-dimensional example is considered. This
   example consists of a simplified system with one angle and one angle
   rate to model the rotational dynamics of the SO. The Cramer-Rao lower
   bound is used to study the effects of geometry on estimation
   performance. It was found that as the number of sides increases, and the
   SO shape tends to an axially symmetric one, the observability in the
   attitude estimates are lost. Finally, the Cramer-Rao lower bound is
   compared with actual performances from estimation approaches for
   estimating the attitude of an SO.}},

Abstract = {{This study compares parameters that characterize vegetation flexibility
   effects on flow resistance and drag. The drag forces occurring on
   flexible bluff bodies are different from the drag occurring on rigid
   bluff bodies due to deformation and reorganization. Drag force data for
   simple cylindrical obstructions of the same shape and size but with
   different flexibility are used to fit drag parameters and to relate
   their value to flexibility through the Cauchy Number. The drag
   coefficient is then evaluated as a function of a new calibration
   velocity parameter which is related to the elastic modulus of the
   obstruction. While the use of a Vogel exponent and reference velocity
   provides a similar response, the reference velocity appears to have a
   critical impact on the parameter and the drag force calculated. The
   proposed formulation more consistently estimates drag reduction for the
   range of flexibilities in this study. Our equations also preserves the
   traditional exponent of the drag relationship, but places a factor onto
   the drag coefficient for flexible elements, rather than a Vogel exponent
   arrangement applied to the flow velocity.}},

Abstract = {{Artificial neural networks are powerful computational systems with
   interconnected neurons. Generally, these networks have a very large
   number of computation nodes which forces the designer to use
   software-based implementations. However, the software based
   implementations are offline and not suitable for portable or real-time
   applications. Experiments show that compared with the software based
   implementations, FPGA-based systems can greatly speed up the computation
   time, making them suitable for real-time situations and portable
   applications. However, the FPGA implementation of neural networks with a
   large number of nodes is still a challenging task.
   In this paper, we exploit stochastic bit streams in the Restricted
   Boltzmann Machine (RBM) to implement the classification of the RBM
   handwritten digit recognition application completely on an FPGA. We use
   finite state machine based (FSM) stochastic circuits to implement the
   required sigmoid function and use the novel stochastic computing
   approach to perform all large matrix multiplications. Experimental
   results show that the proposed stochastic architecture has much more
   potential for tolerating faults while requiring much less hardware
   compared to the currently un-implementable deterministic binary approach
   when the RBM consists of a large number of neurons. Exploiting the
   features of stochastic circuits, our implementation achieves much better
   performance than a software-based approach.}},

Abstract = {{Signal compression is crucial for resourceconstrained wireless neural
   recording applications with limited data bandwidth, and Compressed
   Sensing CS) has successfully demonstrated its potential in this field.
   However, the conventional CS approaches rely on data-dependent and
   computationally intensive dictionary learning processes to find out the
   sparse representation of neural signals, and dictionary re-training is
   inevitable during real experiments. This paper proposes a trainingfree
   CS approach for wireless neural recording. By adopting the analysis
   model to enforce the signal sparsity and constructing a multi-order
   difference matrix as the analysis operator, it avoids the dictionary
   learning procedure and reduces the need for previously acquired data and
   computational complexity. In addition, a group weighted analysis l
   1-minimization method is developed to recover the neural signals.
   Experimental results reveal that the proposed approach outperforms the
   state-of-theart CS methods for wireless neural recording.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless neural recording technologies are severely constrained by the
   limited energy efficiencies and telemetry bandwidth, while data
   compression or feature extraction techniques can be utilized to relax
   the burdens on the wireless data link. Compressed Sensing (CS) is an
   emerging approach for efficient data compression in wireless sensing
   applications. However, state-of-the-art CS encoder designs still lead to
   large area and energy overheads. This paper presents a novel CS encoder
   hardware design by incorporating deterministic measurement matrix,
   namely Quasi-Cyclic Array Code (QCAC) matrix, to improve overall area
   and power metrics over prior arts, while still preserving comparable
   signal recovery performance based on classic reconstruction algorithms.
   We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed QCAC-CS encoder design for
   spike data compression in neural recording application. Compared to the
   state-of-the-art CS encoder designs, QCAC-based CS encoder achieves on
   average (with compression ratio ranging from 0.0625 to 0.25) 42.7\% and
   49.5\% reduction in encoder area and total power consumption,
   respectively. And the compressed spikes from the QCAC-CS encoder can be
   recovered with comparable performance toward random matrix based CS
   encoder designs.}},

   rate are adjustable from 0.5 mu A to 2mA, 100 mu s to 4ms, and 0.1Hz to

Abstract = {{We conduct a detailed analysis of cellular communication patterns using
   (voice/text based) call detail records (CDR) dataset from a nationwide
   cellular network. We analyze a 5-month large dataset containing over
   hundreds of millions of CDRs with a user population of over 5 million to
   dissect meaningful communication patterns, with the goal to understand
   their impact on - and better manage - cellular network resources. What
   makes this dataset interesting is that we have both location and
   timestamp information of the caller and the callee. This allows us to
   associate communication patterns of users with geographic locations. The
   enormous size and diversity inherent in the (big) data set, however,
   makes extracting communication patterns a challenging task. We
   illustrate this diversity by analyzing tower-level activities and
   communication patterns between towers and find certain patterns
   emerging. However, due to the complex structure of the data, extracting
   them becomes non-trivial. By providing structures to the data in the
   form of matrices, we adopt machine learning techniques to extract
   ``latent{''} patterns from the data, while accounting for the inherent
   non-linearity and skewed data distributions. Our main results reveal the
   existence of interesting regional communication patterns of varying

Abstract = {{Chemical reaction networks (CRNs) provide a fundamental model in the
   study of molecular systems. Widely used as formalism for the analysis of
   chemical and biochemical systems, CRNs have received renewed attention
   as a model for molecular computation. This paper demonstrates that, with
   a new encoding, CRNs can compute any set of polynomial functions subject
   only to the limitation that these functions must map the unit interval
   to itself. These polynomials can be expressed as linear combinations of
   Bernstein basis polynomials with positive coefficients less than or
   equal to 1. In the proposed encoding approach, each variable is
   represented using two molecular types: a type-0 and a type-1. The value
   is the ratio of the concentration of type-1 molecules to the sum of the
   concentrations of type-0 and type-1 molecules. The proposed encoding

Abstract = {{This paper presents an active compensation device for common-mode (CM)
   voltage elimination in 3-phase space-vector pulse-width-modulated
   (SVPWM) inverters. The proposed device consists of a single-phase
   2-level inverter (H-bridge) which supplies a compensating voltage to the
   inverter via a step-up common-mode transformer tied to all three phases
   at the output. The H-bridge active filter is supplied by a low voltage
   bus and switched several orders of magnitude faster than the inverter
   switching frequency. This device takes advantage of the direct knowledge
   of the switching pulses sent to the inverter to predict and generate the
   compensating voltage. A technique is employed to subtract the low
   frequency harmonics from the modulation of the H-bridge which allows for
   the size of the common-mode transformer to be reduced significantly.
   Small passive components are added to attenuate the active filter's PWM
   frequency content and thus produce an effective compensating voltage.
   This paper will review existing common-mode voltage compensation
   techniques and demonstrate that the proposed method is a logical choice
   for certain drive applications. Design considerations are included to
   provide understanding and guidance for implementation of the device, as
   well as MATLAB/Simulink simulation results to demonstrate the operation
   of the active compensation device. Final validation is presented through
   experimental results from a hardware prototype.}},

Abstract = {{Voltage source inverters (VSIs) are used in electric drives to generate
   a variable frequency, variable amplitude voltage for motor control. In
   addition to the desired three-phase output voltage, VSIs also generate
   high-frequency common-mode voltage that causes shaft voltage and stray
   currents; that in turn cause EMI and motor failure. VSIs also need a
   stable DC voltage input that is generated from a rectifier or an active
   frontend converter. In contrast matrix converter (MC) based openend
   winding (OE Wdg.) drives offer direct AC/AC conversion, thus eliminating
   the large capacitor in the VSI based system's DC-link. When modulated
   exclusively using rotating vectors, the MC based OE Wdg. drives do not
   generate any commonmode voltage, thus eliminating a major cause of motor
   failure. The advantages offered by the MC based solution require more
   semiconductor switches but less reactive components. To choose between
   this solution and the state-of-the-art, the input/output waveform
   quality, passive component requirements, and the total losses of several
   different solutions are evaluated in this paper. Special attention has
   been paid to the output common-mode voltage related phenomenon since
   common-mode elimination is the primary motivation for employing
   modulation using rotating vectors and an open-end winding drive
   topology.}},

Abstract = {{The need for effective change detection is ever growing with more
   emerging large-scale spatial-temporal datasets that contain gridded time
   series data. To detect meaningful changing events with respect to our
   desired characteristics, in this paper we focus on the
   post-classification change detection problem which aims to apply change
   detection techniques on the time series of classification outputs. To
   study the challenges and to evaluate the performance, we apply the
   change detection techniques to an application of water monitoring using
   remote sensing data. Since the learning model can be affected by special
   properties of remote sensing data, the obtained classification outputs
   usually contain much noise. Therefore the successful change detection
   requires an elaborate mechanism to handle the time series of noisy
   classification outputs. To this end we propose to integrate spatial and
   temporal constraints into an optimization based change detection
   framework. The proposed framework mitigates the noise in the time series
   and can be efficiently solved by an EM-style algorithm. The extensive
   experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets very well
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting the
   water dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Generalized canonical correlation analysis (GCCA) aims at extracting
   common structure from multiple `views', i.e., high-dimensional matrices
   representing the same objects in different feature domains - an
   extension of classical two-view CCA. Existing (G) CCA algorithms have
   serious scalability issues, since they involve square root factorization
   of the correlation matrices of the views. The memory and computational
   complexity associated with this step grow as a quadratic and cubic
   function of the problem dimension (the number of samples / features),
   respectively. To circumvent such difficulties, we propose a GCCA
   algorithm whose memory and computational costs scale linearly in the
   problem dimension and the number of nonzero data elements, respectively.
   Consequently, the proposed algorithm can easily handle very large sparse
   views whose sample and feature dimensions both exceed 100, 000 - while
   the current approaches can only handle thousands of features / samples.
   Our second contribution is a distributed algorithm for GCCA, which
   computes the canonical components of different views in parallel and
   thus can further reduce the runtime significantly (by >= 30\% in
   experiments) if multiple cores are available. Judiciously designed
   synthetic and real-data experiments using a multilingual dataset are
   employed to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{To maintain nominal-flight control system functionalities during fault
   scenarios, enhancement of the state-of-practise angle of attack and
   airspeed sensor fault accommodation strategies are presented. The
   strategy combines a fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) system with a
   rot-Just, fault tolerant, control law. The FDD system allows to maintain
   the nominal flight control law as long as at least one angle of attack
   and airspeed sensor are available. The FDD system is designed using
   advanced nullspace computation, optimization, and signal processing
   tecliniques. For the scenario of a total airspeed measurement loss, an
   airspeed independent longitudinal backup control law is designed using
   global optimization techniques. Using this law avoids the
   state-of-practise switch to a direct law in which the pilot must control
   the elevator positions directly. The results from an extensive
   industrial validation and verification campaign are reported. (C) 2016,

Abstract = {{We take advantage of syntem invariance: and symmetricn to gain convexity
   and computational arlvantanw in regularized H-2 and H-infinity optimal
   control Problems. For systems with symmetric dynamics matrices, the
   problem of minimizing the H-2 or H-infinity performance of the
   closed-loop system can be cast as a convex optimization problem.
   Although the assumption of symmetric is restrictive, studying the
   symmetric component of a general system's dynamic matrices provides
   bounds on the H-2 and H-infinity performance of the original system.
   Furthermore, we show that for certain classes of system,
   blocks-diagnolization of the system matrices can bring the regularized
   optimal control problems into forms amenable to efficient computation
   via distributed algorithms. One such class of systems is
   spatially-invariant systems, whose dynamic matrices are circulant and
   therefore block-diagonalizable by the discrete Fourier transform. (C)

Abstract = {{In recent years, methods for data-driven Koopman spectral analysis, such
   as Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), have become increasingly popular
   approaches for extracting dynamically relevant features from data sets.
   However to establish the connection between techniques like DMD or
   Extended DMD (EDMD) and the Koopman operator, assumptions are made about
   the nature of the supplied data. In particular, both methods assume the
   data were generated by an autonomous dynamical system, which can be
   limiting in certain experimental or computational settings, such as when
   system actuation is present. We present a modification of EDMD that
   overcomes this limitation by compensating for the effects of actuation,
   and is capable of recovering the leading Koopman eigenvalues,
   eigenfunctions, and modes of the unforced system. To highlight the
   efficacy of this approach, we apply it to two examples with
   (quasi)-periodic forcing: the first is the Duffing oscillator, which
   demonstrates eigenfunction approximation, and the second is a lattice
   Boltzmann code that approximates the FitzHugh-Nagumo partial
   differential equation and shows Koopman mode and eigenvalue computation.

Abstract = {{The smart grid is generally considered to be the next generation power
   system that will significantly enhance the efficiency and reliability of
   the power grid, particularly with the integration of renewable energy
   resources and demand response. In the context of the power grid as a
   major critical infrastructure supporting other critical infrastructure
   systems, resiliency and security have become increasingly important. The
   recent occurrence of extreme weather events and blackouts underscore the
   need for a resilient power grid that can quickly recover and restore
   critical services in the case of disruptions. This research explores the
   resilience of an electricity distribution network that is supported in
   part by microgrids. In particular, this study examines how microgrids
   can enhance the resilience of future power systems during emergencies,
   both natural and manmade, by planning for significant events and
   bolstering capabilities to recover quickly with minimal damage. Results
   of this paper provide a better understanding of both issues and
   solutions related to using microgrids to enhance power grid resiliency,

Abstract = {{Robust and adaptive human motion performance depends on learning,
   planning, and deploying primitive elements of behavior. Previous work
   has shown how human motion behavior can be partitioned at subgoal
   points, and primitive elements extracted as trajectory segments between
   subgoals. An aggregate set of trajectory segments are described by a
   spatial cost function and guidance policy. In this paper, Gaussian
   process regression is used to approximate cost and policy functions
   extracted from human-generated trajectories. Patterns are identifying in
   the policy function to further decompose guidance behavior into a
   sequence of motion primitives. A maneuver automaton model is introduced,
   simplifying the guidance task over a larger spatial domain. The maneuver
   automaton and approximated policy functions are then used to generate
   new trajectories, replicating original human behavior examples. (C)

Abstract = {{Search is an essential technology for rescue and other mobile robot
   applications. Many robotic search and rescue systems rely on
   teleoperation. How to cover the search space efficiently is one of the
   key problems in search tasks. Search is also central to humans' daily
   activities. Analyzing human search behavior through teleoperation could
   help improve understanding of human search strategies as well as
   autonomous search algorithms. This research proposes a novel framework
   to model and analyze humans' search behavior. The framework is based on
   structure learning and K-means clustering. The analysis of the
   experimental data demonstrates that (1) humans are able to solve the
   complex search task by breaking it up into smaller tasks; and (2) humans
   consider both coverage and motion cost while searching. The results are
   used to design near optimal subgoals to guide humans in searching.
   Experiments showed that the humans' search performance is improved with
   the subgoals assistance. (C) 2016, IFAC (International Federation of

Abstract = {{Cardiovascular disease continued to be a leading killer world widely.
   Each year, about 400,000 cases of sudden cardiac arrest are reported in
   the U.S. alone. Clinically, radio-frequency ablative procedure has
   become widely applied in the treatment of ventricular arrhythmia.
   Non-invasive approaches have been demonstrated to be able to provide
   important information on the arrhythmogenesis and potentially assist in
   the clinical practice. In this work, we develop and validate a novel
   temporal sparse based imaging method, Cardiac Electrical Sparse Imaging
   (CESI). Computer simulation and animal validation results demonstrate
   that the CESI approach is capable of imaging with improved accuracy and
   robustness by exploiting the temporal sparse property underlying
   cellular electrophysiology. Overall, a CC of 0.8, RE of 0.2 and LE
   (localization error) of 7 mm has been achieved on human realistic
   simulation and good accuracy has been observed in canine simultaneous
   mapping studies. Also, the technique maintains full temporal resolution
   (RRE < 0.04) in terms of the activation sequence under various
   disturbances and in various pathologies such as premature ventricular
   complex and ventricular tachycardia. Our promising results indicate the

Abstract = {{Clinically, healthy hearts have been associated with a high ventricular
   heart rate variability (HRV) while diseased hearts have been known to
   exhibit low ventricular HRV. Hence, low HRV is suggested to be a marker
   of cardiac ventricular arrhythmias. Over the past few years, there has
   been considerable amount of interest in incorporating HRV in pacing to
   emulate healthy heart conditions and re-stabilize the electrical
   activity in diseased hearts. Recently, we used single cell numerical
   simulations to demonstrate that HRV incorporated into periodic pacing
   promotes alternans formation and thus, can be pro-arrhythmic. Here, we
   performed high-resolution optical mapping experiments on Langendorff
   perfused, healthy whole mice hearts to validate our numerical findings.
   Our results indeed demonstrate that HRV promoted the onset of cardiac
   alternans, which is believed to be a precursor of fatal cardiac rhythms.
   Hence, our present study suggests that incorporating HRV into periodic
   pacing while addressing several clinical needs may not be safe. There is
   a pressing need to better understand paced cardiac dynamics and develop
   anti-arrhythmic pacing techniques that would prevent cardiac
   arrhythmias.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia
   that causes stroke affecting more than 2.3 million people in the US.
   Catheter ablation to terminate AF is successful for paroxysmal AF but
   suffers limitations with persistent AF patients as current mapping
   methods cannot identify AF active substrates outside of pulmonary vein
   region. In this work, we developed a novel Kurtosis based mapping
   technique that can accurately identify pivot points of the rotors that
   were induced in ex-vivo isolated rabbit heart. The results indicate that
   the chaotic nature of rotor pivot point results in higher Kurtosis
   compared to the periphery thereby enabling its accurate identification.
   Our results suggest that Kurtosis technique can be further applied to
   intra-atrial electrograms from AF patients with rotors to accurately
   identify the rotor pivot point by generating 3-dimensional (3D)
   patient-specific Kurtosis maps. Validation of this new Kurtosis based
   mapping technology is required through clinical studies with both
   paroxysmal and persistent AF patient data.}},

Abstract = {{Neovascularization is the primary manifestation of proliferative
   diabetic retinopathy (PDR) that can lead to acquired blindness. This
   paper presents a novel method that classifies neovascularizations in the
   1-optic disc (OD) diameter region (NVD) and elsewhere (NVE) separately
   to achieve low false positive rates of neovascularization
   classification. First, the OD region and blood vessels are extracted.
   Next, the major blood vessel segments in the 1-OD diameter region are
   classified for NVD, and minor blood vessel segments elsewhere are
   classified for NVE. For NVD and NVE classifications, optimal
   region-based feature sets of 10 and 6 features, respectively, are used.
   The proposed method achieves classification sensitivity, specificity and
   accuracy for NVD and NVE of 74\%, 98.2\%, 87.6\%, and 61\%, 97.5\%,
   92.1\%, respectively. Also, the proposed method achieves 86.4\%
   sensitivity and 76\% specificity for screening images with PDR from
   public and local data sets. Thus, the proposed NVD and NVE detection
   methods can play a key role in automated screening and prioritization of
   patients with diabetic retinopathy.}},

Abstract = {{Automated classification of retinal vessels in fundus images is the
   first step towards measurement of retinal characteristics that can be
   used to screen and diagnose vessel abnormalities for cardiovascular and
   retinal disorders. This paper presents a novel approach to vessel
   classification to compute the artery/vein ratio (AVR) for all blood
   vessel segments in the fundus image. The features extracted are then
   subjected to a selection procedure using Random Forests (RF) where the
   features that contribute most to classification accuracy are chosen as
   input to a polynomial kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier.
   The most dominant feature was found to be the vessel information
   obtained from the Light plane of the LAB color space. The SVM is then
   subjected to one time training using 10-fold cross validation on images
   randomly selected from the VICAVR dataset before testing on an
   independent test dataset, derived from the same database. An Area Under
   the ROC Curve (AUC) of 97.2\% was obtained on an average of 100 runs of
   the algorithm. The proposed algorithm is robust due to the feature
   selection procedure, and it is possible to get similar accuracies across
   many datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular engineering involves modification and control of cell
   properties, and requires an understanding of fundamentals and mechanisms
   of action for cellular derived product development. One of the keys to
   success in cellular engineering involves the quality and validity of
   results obtained from cell chemical signaling pathway assays. The
   accuracy of the assay data cannot be verified or assured if the effect
   of positive feedback, nonlinearities, and interrelationships between
   cell chemical signaling pathway elements are not understood, modeled,
   and simulated. Nonlinearities and positive feedback in the cell chemical
   signaling pathway can produce significant aberrations in assay data
   collection. Simulating the pathway can reveal potential instability
   problems that will affect assay results. A simulation, using an
   electrical analog for the coupled differential equations representing
   each segment of the pathway, provides an excellent tool for assay
   validation purposes. With this approach, voltages represent pathway
   enzyme concentrations and operational amplifier feedback resistance and
   input resistance values determine pathway gain and rate constants. The
   understanding provided by pathway modeling and simulation is
   strategically important in order to establish experimental controls for
   assay protocol structure, time frames specified between assays, and
   assay concentration variation limits; to ensure accuracy and
   reproducibility of results.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction - Small swine are the most common model now used for
   electrical safety studies. Because of the significant anatomical and
   electrophysiological differences and the effect of animal size on the
   ventricular fibrillation (VF) threshold, there are concerns that these
   differences may exaggerate the risks of electrical devices to humans.
   Methods and Results - We chose, as an illustrative and relevant example,
   swine studies of the TASER (R) conducted electrical weapon (CEW) as it
   has numerous published VF studies. We reviewed the published electrical
   swine safety studies for CEWs and compared them to finite element
   modeling studies, electrical safety standards, and epidemiological
   experience from field usage. We also compared the body weights of the
   swine to those of law enforcement arrest-related deaths.
   Conclusion - Studies of small swine exaggerate the risks of CEWs to
   humans. This conclusion may be extrapolated to suggest that the use of
   small swine for electrical safety studies should be questioned in
   general.}},

Abstract = {{Obssesive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a serious mental illness that
   affects the overall quality of the patients' daily lives. Accurate
   diagnosis of this disorder is a primary step towards effective
   treatment. Diagnosing OCD is a lengthy procedure that involves
   interviews, symptom rating scales and behavioral observation as well as
   the experience of a clinician. Discovering signal processing and network
   based biomarkers from functional magnetic resonance scans of patients
   may greatly assist the clinicians in their diagnostic assessments. In
   this paper, we explore the use of Pearson's correlation scores and
   network based features to predict if a subject has OCD. We extracted
   mean time series from 112 brain regions and decomposed them to
   5-frequency bands. The mean time courses were used to calculate the
   Pearson's correlation matrix and network based features for each band.
   Minimum redundancy maximum relevance feature selection method is applied
   to the Pearson's correlation matrix and network based features from each
   frequency band to select the best features for the final predictor. A
   leave-one-out cross validation method is used for the final predictor
   performance. Our proposed methodology achieves 80\% accuracy (23 out of
   29 subjects classified correctly) with 81\% sensitivity(13 out of 16 OCD
   subjects identified correctly) and 77\% specificity (10 out of 13
   controls identified correctly) using leave-one-out with in-fold feature
   ranking and selection. The most discriminating feature bands are
   0.06-0.11 Hz for Pearson's correlation and 0.03-0.06 Hz for network
   based features. The high classification accuracy indicates the
   predictive power of the network features as well as carefully chosen
   Pearson's correlation values.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a class of structured covariance completion problems which
   aim to complete partially known sample statistics in a way that is
   consistent with the underlying linear dynamics. The statistics of
   stochastic inputs are unknown and sought to explain the given
   correlations. Such inverse problems admit many solutions for the forcing
   correlations, but can be interpreted as an optimal low-rank
   approximation problem for identifying forcing models of low complexity.
   On the other hand, the quality of completion can be improved by
   utilizing information regarding the magnitude of unknown entries. We
   generalize theoretical results regarding the r{*} norm approximation and
   demonstrate the performance of this heuristic in completing partially
   available statistics using stochastically-driven linear models.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method to approximately solve stochastic optimal
   control problems in which the cost function and the system dynamics are
   polynomial. For stochastic systems with polynomial dynamics, the moments
   of the state can be expressed as a, possibly infinite, system of
   deterministic linear ordinary differential equations. By casting the
   problem as a deterministic control problem in moment space, semidefinite
   programming is used to find a lower bound on the optimal solution. The
   constraints in the semidefinite program are imposed by the ordinary
   differential equations for moment dynamics and semidefiniteness of the
   outer product of moments. From the solution to the semidefinite program,
   an approximate optimal control strategy can be constructed using a least
   squares method. In the linear quadratic case, the method gives an exact
   solution to the optimal control problem. In more complex problems, an
   infinite number of moment differential equations would be required to
   compute the optimal control law. In this case, we give a procedure to
   increase the size of the semidefinite program, leading to increasingly
   accurate approximations to the true optimal control strategy.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a convex optimization method to analyze the
   feasibility of a nonconvex bilinear matrix inequality (BMI), which is
   traditionally treated as a NP hard problem. First, a sufficient
   condition for the convexity of a quadratic matrix inequality (QMI),
   which is a more general semidefinite constraint than a BMI, is
   presented. It will be shown that the satisfaction of sufficient
   convexity condition implies that the QMI constraint can be transferred
   into an equivalent linear matrix inequality (LMI) constraint, which can
   be efficiently solved by well-developed interior-point algorithms. This
   result constitutes perhaps the first systematic methodology to verify
   the convexity of QMIs in the literature of semidefinite programming
   (SDP) in Control. For the BMI problem, a method to derive a convex inner
   approximation is discussed. The BMI feasibility analysis method is then
   applied to a nonlinear observer design problem where the estimation
   error dynamics is transformed into a Lure system with a sector condition
   constructed from the element-wise bounds on the Jacobian matrix of the
   nonlinearities. The developed numerical algorithm is used to design a
   nonlinear observer that satisfies multiple performance criteria
   simultaneously.}},

   carry a common cargo. We analyze the stochastic dynamics of such cargos
   and prove that the probability distribution of various motor-motor
   configurations in an ensemble reaches a unique steady state. Existence
   of such a unique steady state indicates a degree of robustness of the
   system of multiple motors sharing a cargo. Analysis of the steady state
   distribution for an ensemble of two kinesin motors for varying load
   forces reveals a degree of cooperativity between the motors, where
   configurations that have the two motors clustered together are favored
   for moderate loads. We further show that when subjected to high forces,
   such as those encountered due to obstacles along the path of travel,
   motors preferably adopt a configuration that facilitates high
   probability of regaining motion once the obstacle is removed. Simulation
   results of the steady state distribution of a two motor ensemble for
   low, moderate and high load forces are presented, which corroborate
   analytical studies.}},

Abstract = {{Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) generates a 3 dimensional 2-tensor field
   that encapsulates properties of diffusing water molecules. We present
   two complementing ideas that may be used to enhance and highlight
   geometric features that are present. The first is based on Ricci flow
   and can be understood as a nonlinear bandpass filtering technique that
   takes into account directionality of the spectral content. More
   specifically, we view the data as a Riemannian metric and, in manner
   reminiscent to reversing the heat equation, we regularize the Ricci flow
   so as to taper off the growth of the higher-frequency speckle-type of
   irregularities. The second approach, in which we again view data as
   defining a Riemannian structure, relies on averaging nearby values of
   the tensor field by weighing the summands in a manner which is inversely
   proportional to their corresponding distances of the tensors. The effect
   of this particular averaging is to enhance consensus among neighboring
   cells, regarding the principle directions and the values of the
   corresponding eigenvalues of the tensor field. This consensus is
   amplified along directions where distances in the Riemannian metric are
   short.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of tracking or disturbance rejection for
   sampled-data control systems, where the tracking signal can have
   frequency components higher than the Nyquist frequency. In view of the
   well-known sampling theorem, one recognizes that any high-frequency
   components may be detected only as an alias in the low base band, and
   hence it is impossible to recover or detect such frequency components.
   This paper examines the basic underlying assumption, and shows that this
   assumption depends crucially on the underlying analog model. We show
   that it is indeed possible to recover such high-frequency signals, and
   also that, by introducing multirate signal processing techniques, it is
   possible to track or reject such frequency components. Detailed analysis
   of multirate closed loop systems and zeros and poles are given. It is
   shown via examples that tracking of high-frequency signals beyond the
   Nyquist frequency can be achieved with satisfactory accuracy.}},

   modes of a system that can be used to construct a reduced-order model.
   This work is motivated by high-fidelity computational models that
   capture fluid and/or structural dynamics, which are prohibitively
   complex for real-time control. A variety of techniques for obtaining
   simplified control-oriented models have been developed, e.g. proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD) and dynamic mode decomposition. In this
   paper, we address the challenge of selecting a few dominant Koopman
   modes for systems with exogenous inputs. We use a linear channel flow
   example to demonstrate the utility of our approach and illustrate the
   advantages relative to alternative techniques for control-oriented

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on power distribution networks featuring distributed
   energy resources (DERs), and develops controllers that drive the DER
   output powers to solutions of time-varying AC optimal power flow (OPF)
   problems. The design of the controllers is grounded on primal-dual-type
   methods for regularized Lagrangian functions, as well as linear
   approximations of the AC power-flow equations. Convergence and
   OPF-solution-tracking capabilities are established while acknowledging:
   i) communication-packet losses, and ii) partial updates of control
   signals. The latter case is particularly relevant since it enables an
   asynchronous operation of the controllers where the DER setpoints are
   updated at a fast time scale based on local voltage measurements, and
   information on the network state is utilized if and when available,
   based on communication constraints. As an application, the paper
   considers distribution systems with a high penetration level of
   photovoltaic systems, and demonstrates that the proposed framework
   provides fast voltage-regulation capabilities, while enabling the near
   real-time pursuit of AC OPF solutions.}},

Abstract = {{We consider transporting a mass on a given directed graph. The mass is
   initially concentrated on certain nodes and needs to be transported in a
   certain time period to another set of nodes, typically disjoint from the
   first. We seek a transport plan which is robust with respect to links
   and nodes failure. In order to achieve that, we need our mass to spread
   over time on all available routes between source and sink nodes as much
   as the topology of the graph allows. The scheduling consists in
   selecting transition probabilities for a Markovian evolution which is
   designed to be consistent with given initial and final marginal
   distributions. In order to construct such a transportation plan, we set
   up a maximum entropy problem (Schrodinger bridge problem) for
   probability laws on paths which can be viewed as an atypical stochastic
   control problem. To achieve robustness, we employ a prior distribution
   on paths which allocates equal probability to paths of equal length
   connecting any two nodes namely the Ruelle-Bowen random walker (M-RB).
   The latter is also shown to be itself the time homogeneous solution of a
   maximum entropy problem for (unnormalized) measures on paths. Since the
   optimal transport plan is computed via a Schrodinger bridge like
   problem, for which an efficient iterative algorithm is available In our
   approach appears also computationally attractive. We provide a few
   examples which illustrate the effectiveness of this method. While in
   this paper, we only consider strongly connected graphs, in a forthcoming
   journal paper {[}2], we show that our approach can be readily extended
   to not strongly connected graphs and weighted graphs. In the latter
   case, this strategy may be used to design a transportation plan which
   effectively compromises between robustness and other criteria such as
   cost.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method to construct a semantic map of an apple orchard
   using a LIDAR and a camera rigidly attached to each other. The system is
   able to capture the map as a standalone sensor which is light-weight and
   can be mounted on a variety of platforms. At the geometry level, we
   present a new method to associate image features captured by the camera
   with 3D points captured by the LIDAR. We then use this method to
   register 3D point-clouds onto a common frame. We show that our
   association method yields superior registration performance compared to
   common methods which work in indoor or urban settings. At the semantic
   level, the apples are identified as distinct objects. Their locations
   and diameters are extracted as relevant attributes. As an example, a
   semantic map of an orchard row is constructed. (C) 2016, lFAC
