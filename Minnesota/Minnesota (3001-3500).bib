Title = {{A Carpooling Recommendation System for Taxicab Services}},

Abstract = {{Carpooling taxicab services hold the promise of providing additional
   transportation supply, especially in the extreme weather or rush hour
   when regular taxicab services are insufficient. Although many
   recommendation systems about regular taxicab services have been proposed
   recently, little research, if any, has been done to assist passengers to
   find a successful taxicab ride with carpooling. In this paper, we
   present the first systematic work to design a unified recommendation
   system for both the regular and carpooling services, called CallCab,
   based on a data-driven approach. In response to a passenger's realtime
   request, CallCab aims to recommend either: 1) a vacant taxicab for a
   regular service with no detour or 2) an occupied taxicab heading to the
   similar direction for a carpooling service with the minimum detour, yet
   without assuming any knowledge of destinations of passengers already in
   taxicabs. To analyze these unknown destinations of occupied taxicabs,
   CallCab generates and refines taxicab trip distributions based on GPS
   data sets and context information collected in the existing taxicab
   infrastructure. To improve CallCab's efficiency to process such a big
   data set, we augment the efficient MapReduce model with a Measure phase
   tailored for our CallCab. Finally, we design a reciprocal price
   mechanism to facilitate the taxicab carpooling implementation in the
   real world. We evaluate CallCab with a real-world data set of 14 000
   taxicabs, and results show that compared with the ground truth, CallCab
   reduces 60\% of the total mileage to deliver all passengers and 41\% of
   passenger's waiting time. Our price mechanism reduces 23\% of
   passengers' fares and increases 28\% of drivers' profits simultaneously.}},

Title = {{Fractional Stefan problems}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{74}},
Pages = {{269-277}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The solution of the classical one-dimensional Stefan problem predicts
   that in time t the melt front goes as s(t) similar to t(1/2). In the
   presence of heterogeneity, however, anomalous behavior can be observed
   where the time exponent n not equal 1/2. In such a case, it may be
   appropriate to write down the governing equations of the Stefan problem
   in terms of fractional order time (1 >= beta > 0) and space (1 >= alpha
   > 0) derivatives. Here, we present sharp and diffuse interface models of
   fractional Stefan problems and discuss available analytical solutions.
   We illustrate that in the fractional time case (beta < 1), a solution of
   the diffuse interface model in the sharp interface limit will not
   coincide with the solution of the sharp interface counterpart; negating
   a well know result of integer derivative Stefan problems. The paper
   concludes with the development of an implicit time stepping numerical
   solution for the diffuse interface fractional Stefan model. Results from
   this solution are verified with available analytical solutions. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{This study experimentally explores how ammonia (NH3), methylamine (MA),
   dimethylamine (DMA), and trimethylamine (TMA) affect the chemical
   formation mechanisms of electrically neutral clusters that contain two
   sulfuric acid molecules (dimers). Dimers may also contain undetectable
   compounds, such as water or bases, that evaporate upon ionization and
   sampling. Measurements were conducted using a glass flow reactor which
   contained a steady flow of humidified nitrogen with sulfuric acid
   concentrations of 10(7) to 10(9) cm(-3). A known molar flow rate of a
   basic gas was injected into the flow reactor. The University of
   Minnesota Cluster Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer was used to
   measure the resulting sulfuric acid vapor and cluster concentrations. It
   was found that, for a given concentration of sulfuric acid vapor, the
   dimer concentration increases with increasing concentration of the basic
   gas, eventually reaching a plateau. The base concentrations at which the
   dimer concentrations saturate suggest NH3 < MA < TMA. DMA in forming
   stabilized sulfuric acid dimers. Two heuristic models for cluster
   formation by acid-base reactions are developed to interpret the data.
   The models provide ranges of evaporation rate constants that are
   consistent with observations and leads to an analytic expression for
   nucleation rates that is consistent with atmospheric observations.}},

Abstract = {{We have used time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer
   (TR-FRET) to characterize the interaction between phospholamban (PLB)
   and the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca-ATPase (SERCA) under conditions
   that relieve SERCA inhibition. Unphosphorylated PLB inhibits SERCA in
   cardiac SR, but inhibition is relieved by either micromolar Ca2+ or PLB
   phosphorylation. In both cases, it has been proposed that inhibition is
   relieved by dissociation of the complex. To test this hypothesis, we
   attached fluorophores to the cytoplasmic domains of SERCA and PLB, and
   reconstituted them functionally in lipid bilayers. TR-FRET, which
   permitted simultaneous measurement of SERCA-PLB binding and structure,
   was measured as a function of PLB phosphorylation and {[}Ca2+]. In all
   cases, two structural states of the SERCA-PLB complex were resolved,
   probably corresponding to the previously described T and R structural
   states of the PLB cytoplasmic domain. Phosphorylation of PLB at S16
   completely relieved inhibition, partially dissociated the SERCA-PLB
   complex, and shifted the T/R equilibrium within the bound complex toward
   the R state. Since the PLB concentration in cardiac SR is at least 10
   times that in our FRET measurements, we calculate that most of SERCA
   contains bound phosphorylated PLB in cardiac SR, even after complete
   phosphorylation. 4 mu M Ca2+ completely relieved inhibition but did not
   induce a detectable change in SERCA-PLB binding or cytoplasmic domain
   structure, suggesting a mechanism involving structural changes in
   SERCA's transmembrane domain. We conclude that Ca2+ and PLB
   phosphorylation relieve SERCA-PLB inhibition by distinct mechanisms, but
   both are achieved primarily by structural changes within the SERCA-PLB
   complex, not by dissociation of that complex. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Numerical analysis of the NO and O generation mechanism in a needle-type
   plasma jet}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{JUN 24}},
Abstract = {{In this paper we study two cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets,
   operating in Ar + 2\% air, with a different electrode geometry but with
   the same power dissipated in the plasma. The density profiles of the
   biomedically active NO and O species throughout the plasma jet,
   previously obtained by laser diagnostics, are calculated by means of a
   zero-dimensional semi-empirical reaction kinetics model. A good
   agreement between the calculated and measured data is demonstrated.
   Furthermore, the most probable spatial power distribution in an RF
   driven plasma jet is obtained for the first time by comparing measured
   and calculated species density profiles. This was possible due to the
   strong effect of the power distribution on the NO and O density
   profiles. In addition the dominant reaction pathways for both the NO and
   the O species are identified. The model allows us to obtain key
   information on the reactive species production inside the jet, which is
   difficult to access by laser diagnostics in a coaxial geometry. Finally,
   we demonstrate that water impurities in the order of 100 ppm in the gas
   feed can have a significant effect on the spatial distribution of the NO
   and O density.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in molecular and synthetic biology call for efficient assembly
   of multi-modular DNA constructs. We hereby present a novel modular
   cloning method that obviates the need for restriction endonucleases and
   significantly improves the efficiency in the design and construction of
   complex DNA molecules by standardizing all DNA elements and cloning
   reactions. Our system, named HomeRun Vector Assembly System (HVAS),
   employs a three-tiered vector series that utilizes both multisite
   gateway cloning and homing endonucleases, with the former building
   individual functional modules and the latter linking modules into the
   final construct. As a proof-of-principle, we first built a two-module
   construct that supported doxycycline-induced expression of green
   fluorescent protein (GFP). Further, with a three-module construct we
   showed quantitatively that there was minimal promoter leakage between
   neighbouring modules. Finally, we developed a method, in vitro Cre
   recombinase-mediated cassette exchange (RMCE) cloning, to regenerate a
   gateway destination vector from a previous multisite gateway cloning
   reaction, allowing access to existing DNA element libraries in
   conventional gateway entry clones, and simple creation of constructs
   ready for in vivo RMCE. We believe these methods constitute a useful
   addition to the standard molecular cloning techniques that could
   potentially support industrial scale synthesis of DNA constructs.}},

Abstract = {{Medium-chain-length poly(hydroxyalkanoate)s (PHA(mcl)) are biodegradable
   and renewable biopolymers with elastomeric qualities. Here we report on
   the preparation and characterization of composite materials using
   thermally reduced graphene (TRG) nanoparticles as filler with three
   PHA(mcl) polymers. The matrices vary with respect to chain packing
   length, capacity for noncovalent bonding with the TRG surface, and the
   presence of covalent cross-linking. Results show that the addition of up
   to 2.5 vol \% TRG to PHA(mcl) increases the melting temperature by 1-3
   degrees C, the modulus by 200-590\%, and the electrical conductivity by
   >7 orders of magnitude. Additionally, we use rheology and microscopy to
   characterize the composites. We discuss our results in light of polymer
   entanglement theory and the effects of polymer structure, filler loading
   volume, and the role of graphene-polymer interfacial forces. We extend
   our discussion by comparing the modulus enhancements of PHA(mcl)
   composites to those reported in other studies in which layered carbon
   nanofillers are combined with structurally related biopolyesters
   including: polylactide, polylactide-co-polyglycolide, polycaprolactone,

Title = {{Tunable random telegraph noise in individual square permalloy dots}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},

Month = {{JUN 23}},
Abstract = {{Magnetization fluctuations caused by thermal energies are poorly
   understood, yet they represent a fundamental limit for many magnetic
   technologies. Here, thermal fluctuations of the magnetization are
   quantitatively characterized. The model magnetic system is thin square
   magnetic dots (<10nm) with side lengths down to 200nm. The magnetic
   state and the fluctuations are determined in individual dots by
   measuring the anisotropic magnetoresistance. The magnetization exhibits
   random telegraph noise with a transition rate determined by the dot
   size, the applied magnetic field, and the sample temperature. An energy
   barrier model of the system explains the dependence of the magnetic
   fluctuations on these parameters and is supported by additional
   experiments unaffected by the magnetic fluctuations. This independent
   identification of the mechanism producing magnetic noise, and its
   agreement with micromagnetic simulations, demonstrates a microscopic
   understanding of noise extendable to more complex noise sources such as
   1/f noise. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Optical spacing effect in organic photovoltaic cells incorporating a
   dilute acceptor layer}},
Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{24}},
Month = {{JUN 16}},
Abstract = {{The addition of spacing layers in organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) can
   enhance light absorption by optimizing the spatial distribution of the
   incident optical field in the multilayer structure. We explore the
   optical spacing effect in OPVs achieved using a diluted electron
   acceptor layer of C-60. While optical spacing is often realized by
   optimizing buffer layer thickness, we find that optical spacing via
   dilution leads to cells with similar or enhanced photocurrent. This is
   observed despite a smaller quantity of absorbing molecules, suggesting a
   more efficient use of absorbed photons. In fact, dilution is found to
   concentrate optical absorption near the electron donor-acceptor
   interface, resulting in a marked increase in the exciton diffusion
   efficiency. Contrasting the use of changes in thickness to engineer
   optical absorption, the use of dilution does not significantly alter the
   overall thickness of the OPV. Optical spacing via dilution is shown to
   be a viable alternative to more traditional optical spacing techniques
   and may be especially useful in the continued optimization of
   next-generation, tandem OPVs where it is important to minimize
   competition for optical absorption between individual sub-cells. (C)

Abstract = {{During the 2011 Eastern Pacific Emitted Aerosol Cloud Experiment
   (E-PEACE) and 2013 Nucleation in California Experiment (NiCE) field
   campaigns, a predominantly organic aerosol (> 85\% by mass) was observed
   in the free troposphere over marine stratocumulus off the coast of
   California. These particles originated from a densely forested region in
   the Northwestern United States. The organic mass spectrum resolved by
   positive matrix factorization is consistent with the mass spectra of
   previously measured biogenic organic aerosol. Particulate organic mass
   exhibits a latitudinal gradient that corresponds to the geographical
   distribution of vegetation density and composition, with the highest
   concentration over regions impacted by densely populated monoterpene
   sources. Due to meteorological conditions during summer months,
   cloud-clearing events transport aerosol from the Northwestern United
   States into the free troposphere above marine stratocumulus. Based on
   the variation of meteorological variables with altitude, dry air
   containing enhanced biogenic organic aerosol is shown to entrain into
   the marine boundary layer. Fresh impacts on cloud water composition are
   observed north of San Francisco, CA which is consistent with fresh
   continental impacts on the marine atmosphere at higher latitudes.
   Continental aerosol size distributions are bimodal. Particles in the
   100nm mode are impacted by biogenic sources, while particles in the
   approximate to 30nm mode may originate from fresh biogenic emissions.
   Continental aerosol in the 100nm mode is cloud condensation nuclei
   active and may play a role in modulating marine stratocumulus
   microphysics.}},

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 12}},
Abstract = {{Tools that provide improved ability to relate genotype to phenotype have
   the potential to accelerate breeding for desired traits and to improve
   our understanding of the molecular variants that underlie phenotypes.
   The availability of large-scale gene expression profiles in maize
   provides an opportunity to advance our understanding of complex traits
   in this agronomically important species. We built co-expression networks
   based on genome-wide expression data from a variety of maize accessions
   as well as an atlas of different tissues and developmental stages. We
   demonstrate that these networks reveal clusters of genes that are
   enriched for known biological function and contain extensive structure
   which has yet to be characterized. Furthermore, we found that
   co-expression networks derived from developmental or tissue atlases as
   compared to expression variation across diverse accessions capture
   unique functions. To provide convenient access to these networks, we
   developed a public, web-based Co-expression Browser (COB), which enables
   interactive queries of the genome-wide networks. We illustrate the
   utility of this system through two specific use cases: one in which
   gene-centric queries are used to provide functional context for
   previously characterized metabolic pathways, and a second where lists of
   genes produced by mapping studies are further resolved and validated
   using co-expression networks.}},

Abstract = {{De Gennes' blob theory has been remarkably successful at describing
   weakly confined polymers in both slits and channels, and comparable
   results surround Odijk's theory of deflection segments for strongly
   confined wormlike polymers in nanochannels. However, given the success
   of Odijk's theory in channels, it is remarkable that there is no
   comprehensive theory for the simple case of a wormlike polymer strongly
   confined between two parallel plates. We propose such a theory by
   drawing inspiration from the existing literature on ideal wormlike
   chains in slits and Daoud and de Gennes' idea of mapping a slit-confined
   chain to a two-dimensional chain. We postulate that the chain can be
   quantitatively described as a two-dimensional wormlike chain with a weak
   perturbation in the confining dimension due to deflection segments. By
   incorporating the effects of real chains, where the variable slit depth
   adds subtlety due to concomitant changes in the strength of excluded
   volume interactions, our theory predicts the existence of three distinct

Abstract = {{Development of sustainable and biodegradable materials is essential for
   future growth of the chemical industry. For a renewable product to be
   commercially competitive, it must be economically viable on an
   industrial scale and possess properties akin or superior to existing
   petroleum-derived analogs. Few biobased polymers have met this
   formidable challenge. To address this challenge, we describe an
   efficient biobased route to the branched lactone,
   beta-methyl-delta-valerolactone (beta M delta VL), which can be
   transformed into a rubbery (i.e., low glass transition temperature)
   polymer. We further demonstrate that block copolymerization of beta M
   delta VL and lactide leads to a new class of high-performance polyesters
   with tunable mechanical properties. Key features of this work include
   the creation of a total biosynthetic route to produce beta M delta VL,
   an efficient semisynthetic approach that employs high-yielding chemical
   reactions to transform mevalonate to beta M delta VL, and the use of
   controlled polymerization techniques to produce well-defined PLA-P beta
   M delta VL-PLA triblock polymers, where PLA stands for poly (lactide).
   This comprehensive strategy offers an economically viable approach to
   sustainable plastics and elastomers for a broad range of applications.}},

   Metabolism}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 9}},
Abstract = {{The flux of glycolysis is tightly controlled by feed-back and
   feed-forward allosteric regulations to maintain the body's glucose
   homeostasis and to respond to cell's growth and energetic needs. Using a
   mathematical model based on reported mechanisms for the allosteric
   regulations of the enzymes, we demonstrate that glycolysis exhibits
   multiple steady state behavior segregating glucose metabolism into high
   flux and low flux states. Two regulatory loops centering on
   phosphofructokinase and on pyruvate kinase each gives rise to the
   bistable behavior, and together impose more complex flux control. Steady
   state multiplicity endows glycolysis with a robust switch to transit
   between the two flux states. Under physiological glucose concentrations
   the glycolysis flux does not move between the states easily without an
   external stimulus such as hormonal, signaling or oncogenic cues.
   Distinct combination of isozymes in glycolysis gives different cell
   types the versatility in their response to different biosynthetic and
   energetic needs. Insights from the switch behavior of glycolysis may
   reveal new means of metabolic intervention in the treatment of cancer
   and other metabolic disorders through suppression of glycolysis.}},

Title = {{Heart rate variability and alternans formation in the heart: The role of
   feedback in cardiac dynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{350}},
Pages = {{90-97}},
Month = {{JUN 7}},
Abstract = {{A beat-to-beat alternation in the action potential duration (APD) of
   myocytes, i.e. alternans, is believed to be a direct precursor of
   ventricular fibrillation in the whole heart. A common approach for the
   prediction of alternans is to construct the restitution curve, which is
   the nonlinear functional relationship between the APD and the preceding
   diastolic interval (DI). It was proposed that alternans appears when the
   magnitude of the slope of the restitution curve exceeds one, known as
   the restitution hypothesis. However, this restitution hypothesis was
   derived under the assumption of periodic stimulation, when there is a
   dependence of the DI on the immediate preceding APD (i.e. feedback).
   However, under physiological conditions, the heart rate exhibits
   substantial variations in time, known as heart rate variability (HRV),
   which introduces deviations from periodic stimulation in the system. In
   this manuscript, we investigated the role of HRV on alternans formation
   in isolated cardiac myocytes using numerical simulations of an ionic
   model of the cardiac action potential. We used this model with two
   different pacing protocols: a periodic pacing protocol with feedback and
   a protocol without feedback. We show that when HRV is incorporated in
   the periodic pacing protocol, it facilitated alternans formation in the
   isolated cell, but did not significantly change the magnitude of
   alternans. On the other hand, in the case of the pacing protocol without
   feedback, alternans formation was prevented, even in the presence of
   HRV. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Interaction of APOBEC3A with DNA Assessed by Atomic Force Microscopy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{The APOBEC3 family of DNA cytosine deaminases functions block the spread
   of endogenous retroelements and retroviruses including HIV-1. Potency
   varies among family members depending on the type of parasitic
   substrate. APOBEC3A (A3A) is unique among the human enzymes in that it
   is expressed predominantly in myeloid lineage cell types, it strongly
   induced by innate immune agonists such as type 1 interferon, and it has
   the capacity to accommodate both normal and 5-methyl cytosine
   nucleobases Here we apply atomic force microscopy (AFM) to characterize
   the interaction between A3A and single- and double-stranded DNA using a
   hybrid DNA approach in which a single-stranded region is flanked by
   defined length duplexes. AFM image analyses reveal A3A binding to
   single-stranded DNA, and that this interaction becomes most evident
   (similar to 80\% complex yield) at high protein-to-DNA ratios (at least
   100:1). A3A is predominantly monomeric when bound to single-stranded
   DNA, and it is also monomeric in solution at concentrations as high as
   50 nM. These properties agree well with recent, biochemical,
   biophysical, and structural studies. However, these characteristics
   contrast with those of the related enzyme APOBEC3G, which in similar
   assays can exist as a monomer but tends to form oligomers in a
   concentration-dependent manner. These AFM data indicate that A3A has
   intrinsic biophysical differences that distinguish it from APOBEC3G. The
   potential relationships between these properties and biological
   functions in innate immunity are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{A new type of acid-labile cationic copolymer consisting of a hydrophilic
   poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) block and a polymethacrylamide block bearing
   tertiary amines linked by acid-labile ortho ester rings in side chains
   (PAOE), with defined chain length, had been synthesized via RAFT
   polymerization. The copolymers could efficiently bind and condense
   plasmid DNA at neutral pH into narrowly dispersed nano-scale polyplexes.
   The hydrolysis of ortho ester group in the side-chains of PAOE followed
   a distinct exocyclic mechanism and the rate of hydrolysis was much
   accelerated at mildly acidic pH, resulting in the accelerated disruption
   of polyplexes and the release of intact plasmid DNA. The three polymers
   were not toxic to cultured COS-7 cells as measured by MIT assay. As
   expected, PEG segments of the PEG-b-PAOE copolymers prevented
   nonspecific transfection of COS-7 cells. Once conjugated to a targeting
   ligand to enhance cell-specific entry, PEG-b-PAOE with its pH-triggered
   DNA release properties may achieve efficient intracellular delivery of
   DNA or other nucleic acid therapeutics. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{A novel distributed range-free localisation algorithm to accurately
   locate regular nodes in wireless sensor networks is presented. Existing
   methods reduce the possible area where a regular node would be located
   by using anchors (i.e. nodes with known locations) only. These methods
   are effective only when anchor density is high. In contrast, the work
   presented here reduces the possible area of a regular node iteratively,
   using both anchor node locations and the possible areas of its
   neighbouring and non-neighbouring `regular' nodes from early iteration.
   This allows a significant improvement in the localisation accuracy.
   Simulations verify the advantage of the proposed algorithm and show that
   the localisation error can be controlled within 15\% with off-the-shelf
   devices.}},

Abstract = {{Defects have been intentionally introduced in a rubrene single crystal
   by means of two different mechanisms: ultraviolet ozone (UVO) exposure
   and x-ray irradiation. A complete drift-diffusion model based on the
   mobility edge (ME) concept, which takes into account asymmetries and
   nonuniformities in the semiconductor, is used to estimate the energetic
   and spatial distribution of trap states. The trap distribution for
   pristine devices can be decomposed into two well defined regions: a
   shallow region ascribed to structural disorder and a deeper region
   ascribed to defects. UVO and x ray increase the hole trap concentration
   in the semiconductor with different energetic and spatial signatures.
   The former creates traps near the top surface in the 0.3-0.4 eV region,
   while the latter induces a wider distribution of traps extending from
   the band edge with a spatial distribution that peaks near the top and
   bottom interfaces. In addition to inducing hole trap states in the
   transport gap, both processes are shown to reduce the mobility with
   respect to a pristine crystal.}},

Abstract = {{A molecular beam mass spectrometer has been calibrated and used to
   measure the air entrainment, nitric oxide and ozone concentrations in

   far effluent of the argon plasma jet. The difference in air entrainment
   when the plasma is undisturbed or is close to a well, which is the case
   for e. g. in vitro plasma-cell interaction studies, is shown. In
   addition, an exponential decay of the positive ion flux as a function of
   distance in the effluent is obtained. Furthermore, the effect of plasma
   power, duty cycle and air and O-2 admixtures introduced into the argon
   flow on the NO and O-3 production is presented, including the
   possibility of independent control of the NO and O-3 flux from the jet.}},

Abstract = {{The anaerobic activities in swine slurry storage and treatment generate
   biogas containing gaseous ammonia component which is a chemical agent
   that can cause adverse environmental impacts when released to the
   atmosphere. The aim of this pilot plant study was to remove ammonia from
   biogas generated in a covered lagoon, using a sulfuric acid wet
   scrubber. The data showed that, on average, the biogas contained 43.7ppm
   of ammonia and its concentration was found to be exponentially related
   to the air temperature inside the lagoon. When the air temperature rose
   to 35 degrees C and the biogas ammonia concentration reached 90ppm, the
   mass transfer of ammonia/ammonium from the deeper liquid body to the
   interface between the air and liquid became a limiting factor. The
   biogas velocity was critical in affecting ammonia removal efficiency of
   the wet scrubber. A biogas flow velocity of 8 to 12mm s(-1) was
   recommended to achieve a removal efficiency of greater than 60\%.
   Stepwise regression revealed that the biogas velocity and air
   temperature, not the inlet ammonia concentration in biogas, affected the
   ammonia removal efficiency. Overall, when 73g L-1 (or 0.75M) sulfuric
   acid solution was used as the scrubber solution, removal efficiencies
   varied from 0\% to 100\% with an average of 55\% over a 40-d measurement
   period. Mass balance calculation based on ammonium-nitrogen
   concentration in final scrubber liquid showed that about 21.3g of
   ammonia was collected from a total volume of 1169m(3) of biogas, while
   the scrubber solution should still maintain its ammonia absorbing
   ability until its concentration reaches up to 1M. These results showed
   promising use of sulfuric acid wet scrubber for ammonia removal in the
   digester biogas.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a new method for polynomial optimization with

   is to apply the classical alternating direction method of multipliers

   this allows us to fully exploit the multi-block structure of the
   polynomial functions, even though the optimization model encountered is
   highly non-linear and non-convex. The new method is shown to be
   convergent under some conditions, and the numerical results show that
   the algorithm returns high quality solutions and runs much faster than
   the two other competing algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{We consider service systems with a finite number of customer arrivals,
   where customer interarrival times and service times are both stochastic
   and heterogeneous. Applications of such systems are numerous and include
   systems where arrivals are driven by events or service completions in
   serial processes as well as systems where servers are subject to
   learning or fatigue. Using an embedded Markov chain approach, we
   characterize the waiting time distribution for each customer, from which
   we obtain various performance measures of interest, including the
   expected waiting time of a specific customer, the expected waiting time
   of an arbitrary customer, and the expected completion time of all
   customers. We carry out extensive numerical experiments to examine the
   effect of heterogeneity in interarrival and service times. In
   particular, we examine cases where interarrival and service times
   increase with each subsequent arrival or service completion, decrease,
   increase and then decrease, or decrease and then increase. We derive
   several managerial insights and discuss implications for settings where
   such features can be induced. We validate the numerical results using a
   fluid approximation that yields closed-form expressions.}},

Abstract = {{Inpatient staffing costs are significantly affected by nurse
   absenteeism, which is typically high in U. S. hospitals. We use data
   from multiple inpatient units of two hospitals to study which factors,
   including unit culture, short-term workload, and shift type, explain
   nurse absenteeism. The analysis highlights the importance of paying
   attention to heterogeneous absentee rates among individual nurses. We
   then develop models to investigate the impact of demand and absentee
   rate variability on the performance of staffing plans and obtain some
   structural results. Utilizing these results, we propose and test three
   easy-to-use heuristics to identify near-optimal staffing strategies.
   Such strategies could be useful to hospitals that periodically reassign
   nurses with similar qualifications to inpatient units in order to
   balance workload and accommodate changes in patient flow. Although
   motivated by staffing of hospital inpatient units, the approach
   developed in this paper is also applicable to other team-based and
   labor-intensive service environments.}},

Abstract = {{The atmospheric boundary layer adjustment at the abrupt transition from
   a canopy (forest) to a flat surface (land or water) is investigated in a
   wind tunnel experiment. Detailed measurements examining the effect of
   canopy turbulence on flow separation, reduced surface shear stress
   andwake recovery are compared to data for the classical case of a solid
   backward-facing step. Results provide new insights into the
   interpretation for flux estimation by eddy-covariance and flux gradient
   methods and for the assessment of surface boundary conditions in
   turbulence models of the atmospheric boundary layer in complex
   landscapes and over water bodies affected by canopy wakes. The wind
   tunnel results indicate that the wake of a forest canopy strongly
   affects surface momentum flux within a distance of 35-100 times the step
   or canopy height, and mean turbulence quantities require distances of at
   least 100 times the canopy height to adjust to the new surface. The
   near-surface mixing length in the wake exhibits characteristic length
   scales of canopy flows at the canopy edge, of the flow separation in the
   near wake and adjusts to surface layer scaling in the far wake.
   Components of the momentum budget are examined individually to determine
   the impact of the canopy wake. The results demonstrate why a constant
   flux layer does not form until far downwind in the wake. An empirical
   model for surface shear stress distribution from a forest canopy to a
   clearing or lake is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a cloud-based heterogeneous network of base stations (BSs)
   connected via a backhaul network of routers and wired/wireless links
   with limited capacity. The optimal provision of such networks requires
   proper resource allocation across the radio access links in conjunction
   with appropriate traffic engineering within the backhaul network. In
   this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for joint resource
   allocation across the wireless links and flow control over the entire
   network. The proposed algorithm, which maximizes the min-rate among all
   the transmitted commodities, is based on a decomposition approach that
   leverages both the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)
   and the weighted-MMSE (WMMSE) algorithm. We show that this algorithm is
   easily parallelizable and converges globally to a stationary solution of
   the joint optimization problem. The proposed algorithm can also be
   extended to networks with multi-antenna nodes and other utility
   functions.}},

Volume = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Law enforcement officers expect that a TASER (R) CEW (Conducted
   Electrical Weapon) broad-spread probe exposure will temporarily
   incapacitate a subject who will then be able to immediately (similar to
   1 s delay) recover motor control in order to comply with commands.
   However, this recovery time has not been previously reported.
   Methods A total of 32 police academy students were exposed to a very
   broad-spread 5 s CEW stimulus as part of their training and told to
   depress a push-button as soon as they sensed the stimulus. A subgroup
   also depressed the push-button after being alerted by an audio stimulus.
   Results The response time after the audio trigger was 1.05 +/- 0.25 s;
   the median was 1.04 s (range 0.69-1.34 s). For the paired CEW triggered
   group the mean response time was 1.41 +/- 0.61 s with a median of 1.06 s
   (range 0.92-2.18 s), which was not statistically different. Only 2/32
   subjects were able to depress the button during the CEW exposure and
   with delays of 3.09 and 4.70 s from the start. Of the remaining 30
   subjects the mean response time to execute the task (once the CEW
   exposure ended) was 1.27 +/- 0.58 s with a median of 1.19 s (range
   0.31-2.99 s) (NS vs. the audio trigger).
   Conclusions With a very-broad electrode spread, a CEW exposure could
   prevent or delay some purposeful movements. Normal reaction times appear
   to return immediately (similar to 1 s) after the CEW exposure ceases.}},

Abstract = {{A large 20-year database on water clarity for all Minnesota lakes >= 8
   ha was analyzed statistically for spatial distributions, temporal
   trends, and relationships with in-lake and watershed factors that
   potentially affect lake clarity. The database includes Landsat-based
   water clarity estimates expressed in terms of Secchi depth (SDLandsat),
   an integrative measure of water quality, for more than 10,500 lakes for
   time periods centered around 1985, 1990, 1995, 2000, and 2005. Minnesota
   lake clarity is lower (more turbid) in the south and southwest and
   clearer in the north and northeast; this pattern is evident at the
   levels of individual lakes and ecoregions. Temporal trends in clarity
   were detected in similar to 11\% of the lakes: 4.6\% had improving
   clarity and 6.2\% had decreasing clarity. Ecoregions in southern and
   western Minnesota, where agriculture is the predominant land use, had
   higher percentages of lakes with decreasing clarity than the rest of the
   state, and small and shallow lakes had higher percentages of decreasing
   clarity trends than large and deep lakes. The mean SDLandsat state-wide
   remained stable from 1985 to 2005 but decreased in ecoregions dominated
   by agricultural land use. Deep lakes had higher clarity than shallow
   lakes statewide and for lakes grouped by land cover. SDLandsat decreased
   as the percentage of agriculture and/or urban area increased at county
   and catchment levels and it increased with increasing forested land.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes LARS{*}, a location-aware recommender system that
   uses location-based ratings to produce recommendations. Traditional
   recommender systems do not consider spatial properties of users nor
   items; LARS{*}, on the other hand, supports a taxonomy of three novel
   classes of location-based ratings, namely, spatial ratings for
   non-spatial items, non-spatial ratings for spatial items, and spatial
   ratings for spatial items. LARS{*} exploits user rating locations
   through user partitioning, a technique that influences recommendations
   with ratings spatially close to querying users in a manner that
   maximizes system scalability while not sacrificing recommendation
   quality. LARS{*} exploits item locations using travel penalty, a
   technique that favors recommendation candidates closer in travel
   distance to querying users in a way that avoids exhaustive access to all
   spatial items. LARS{*} can apply these techniques separately, or
   together, depending on the type of location-based rating available.
   Experimental evidence using large-scale real-world data from both the
   Foursquare location-based social network and the MovieLens movie
   recommendation system reveals that LARS{*} is efficient, scalable, and
   capable of producing recommendations twice as accurate compared to
   existing recommendation approaches.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Data summarization is an important concept in data mining for finding a
   compact representation of a dataset. In spatial network activity
   summarization (SNAS), we are given a spatial network and a collection of
   activities (e. g., pedestrian fatality reports, crime reports) and the
   goal is to find k shortest paths that summarize the activities. SNAS is
   important for applications where observations occur along linear paths
   such as roadways, train tracks, etc. SNAS is computationally challenging
   because of the large number of k subsets of shortest paths in a spatial
   network. Previous work has focused on either geometry or subgraph-based
   approaches (e. g., only one path), and cannot summarize activities using
   multiple paths. This paper proposes a K-Main Routes (KMR) approach that
   discovers k shortest paths to summarize activities. KMR generalizes
   K-means for network space but uses shortest paths instead of ellipses to
   summarize activities. To improve performance, KMR uses network Voronoi,
   divide and conquer, and pruning strategies. We present a case study
   comparing KMR's network-based output (i.e., shortest paths) to
   geometry-based outputs (e. g., ellipses) on pedestrian fatality data.
   Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that KMR with our
   performance-tuning decisions yields substantial computational savings
   without reducing summary path coverage.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Characterize where the circumflex artery crosses between the
   coronary sinus and mitral valve in order to minimize the occurrence of
   coronary compression during percutaneous indirect mitral valve
   interventions.
   Background: Treatment of mitral valve regurgitation using an indirect
   percutaneous approach via access through the coronary sinus remains
   under active research and development. Characterization of anatomical
   locations where the circumflex artery crosses between the coronary sinus
   and mitral valve is important for mitigation of serious ischemic
   complications.
   Methods: Magnetic resonance images were obtained for 65 perfusion-fixed
   human hearts. Three-dimensional reconstructions of anatomical
   orientations of the coronary sinus, circumflex artery, and mitral valve
   annulus were generated. The prevalence and location of sites where the
   circumflex artery coursed between the coronary sinus and mitral valve
   were assessed.
   Results: The circumflex artery coursed between the coronary sinus and
   mitral valve in 88\% of specimens. Overlaps between the circumflex
   artery and coronary sinus were less prevalent more proximal to the
   coronary sinus ostium. The coronary sinus did not lie in the same plane
   as the mitral annulus in roughly 20\% of the hearts.
   Conclusion: The prevalence of circumflex overlap between the coronary
   sinus and mitral valve was common across the sample size. The large
   variability in anatomy confirms the value of imaging individual patient
   cardiac anatomy prior to performing indirect percutaneous mitral valve
   annuloplasty to avoid impairment to the circumflex artery. This novel
   database can be utilized in the development of additional cardiac
   therapies that require access to the coronary sinus, such as therapeutic
   ablations.}},

Abstract = {{Decision strategies in dynamic environments do not always succeed in
   producing desired outcomes, particularly in complex, ill-structured
   domains. Information systems often capture large amounts of data about
   such environments. We propose a domain-independent, iterative approach
   that (a) applies data mining classification techniques to the collected
   data in order to discover the conditions under which dynamic
   decision-making strategies produce undesired or suboptimal outcomes and
   (b) uses this information to improve the decision strategy under these
   conditions. In this paper, we formally develop this approach and
   illustrate it by providing detailed examples of its application to a
   chronic disease care problem in a healthcare management organization,
   specifically the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In
   particular, the proposed iterative approach is used to improve treatment
   strategies by predicting and eliminating treatment failures, i.e.,
   insufficient or excessive treatment actions, based on information that
   is available in electronic medical record systems. We also apply the
   proposed approach to a manufacturing task, resulting in substantial
   decision strategy improvements, which further demonstrates the
   generality and flexibility of the proposed approach.}},

Title = {{Natural snowfall reveals large-scale flow structures in the wake of a
   2.5-MW wind turbine}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{To improve power production and structural reliability of wind turbines,
   there is a pressing need to understand how turbines interact with the
   atmospheric boundary layer. However, experimental techniques capable of
   quantifying or even qualitatively visualizing the large-scale turbulent
   flow structures around full-scale turbines do not exist today. Here we
   use snowflakes from a winter snowstorm as flow tracers to obtain
   velocity fields downwind of a 2.5-MW wind turbine in a sampling area of
   similar to 36 x 36m(2). The spatial and temporal resolutions of the
   measurements are sufficiently high to quantify the evolution of
   blade-generated coherent motions, such as the tip and trailing sheet
   vortices, identify their instability mechanisms and correlate them with
   turbine operation, control and performance. Our experiment provides an
   unprecedented in situ characterization of flow structures around
   utility-scale turbines, and yields significant insights into the
   Reynolds number similarity issues presented in wind energy applications.}},

Abstract = {{The doping of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), which is vital for the
   optimization of NC-based devices, remains a significant challenge. While
   gas-phase plasma approaches have been successful in incorporating dopant
   atoms into NCs, little is known about their electronic activation. Here,
   we investigate the electronic properties of doped silicon NC thin films
   cast from solution by field effect transistor analysis. We find that,
   analogous to bulk silicon, boron and phosphorus electronically dope Si
   NC thin films; however, the dopant activation efficiency is only similar
   to 10(-2)-10(-4). We also show that surface doping of Si NCs is an
   effective way to alter the carrier concentrations in Si NC films.}},

Abstract = {{Millions of biological samples are currently kept at low tempertures in
   cryobanks/biorepositories for long-term storage. The quality of the

   selecting a storage temperature for a biospecimen based on current
   scientific understanding. To that end, this article reviews some
   physical basics of the temperature, nucleation, and ice crystal growth
   present in biological samples stored at low temperatures (-20 degrees C
   to -196 degrees C), and our current understanding of the role of
   temperature on the activity of degradative molecules present in
   biospecimens. The scientific literature relevant to the stability of
   specific biomarkers in human fluid, cell, and tissue biospecimens is
   also summarized for the range of temperatures between -20 degrees C to
   -196 degrees C. These studies demonstrate the importance of storage
   temperature on the stability of critical biomarkers for fluid, cell, and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the properties of a recently proposed class of
   semiparametric discrete choice models (referred to as the marginal
   distribution model (MDM)), by optimizing over a family of joint error
   distributions with prescribed marginal distributions. Surprisingly, the
   choice probabilities arising from the family of generalized extreme
   value models of which the multinomial logit model is a special case can
   be obtained from this approach, despite the difference in assumptions on
   the underlying probability distributions. We use this connection to
   develop flexible and general choice models to incorporate consumer and
   product level heterogeneity in both partworths and scale parameters in
   the choice model. Furthermore, the extremal distributions obtained from
   the MDM can be used to approximate the Fisher's information matrix to
   obtain reliable standard error estimates of the partworth parameters,
   without having to bootstrap the method. We use simulated and empirical
   data sets to test the performance of this approach. We evaluate the
   performance against the classical multinomial logit, mixed logit, and a
   machine learning approach that accounts for partworth heterogeneity. Our
   numerical results indicate that MDM provides a practical semiparametric
   alternative to choice modeling.}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{The present work considers the convergence of two approaches for syngas
   production: solar fuels via the cerium oxide (ceria) redox cycle and the
   partial oxidation of methane. The chemical thermodynamics of the
   ceria-methane system reveal that coupling the reduction of ceria to the
   partial oxidation of methane enables isothermal cycling at temperatures
   as low as 1223 K with the additional production of high-quality syngas
   during the reduction step. The equilibrium non-stoichiometry of the
   oxidation step has a substantial impact on the conversion of the
   oxidizer to fuel, with important implications for cycle efficiency. A
   model of the process thermodynamics is used to evaluate the efficiency
   of the cycle and its sensitivity to oxidation non-stoichiometry,
   temperature, and concentration ratio. Reduction with methane enables
   significant gains in efficiency over other proposed approaches, with
   plausible solar-to-fuel efficiencies reaching 40\% without any heat

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{We consider the downlink coordinated beamforming problem in a cellular
   network in which the base stations (BSs) are equipped with multiple
   antennas and each user is equipped with a single antenna. The BSs
   cooperate in sharing their local interference information, and they aim
   to maximize the sum-rate of the users in the network. A decentralized
   interference pricing beamforming (IPBF) algorithm is proposed to
   identify the coordinated beamformer, where a BS is penalized according
   to the interference it creates to its peers. We show that the
   decentralized pricing mechanism converges to an interference
   equilibrium, which is a KKT point of the sum-rate maximization problem.
   The proofs rely on the identification of rank-1 solutions of each BSs'
   interference-penalized rate maximization problem. Numerical results show
   that the proposed iterative mechanism reduces significantly the
   exchanged information with respect to other state-of-the-art beamforming
   algorithms with very little sum-rate loss. The version of the algorithm
   that limits the coordination to a cluster of base stations (IPBF-L) is
   shown to have very small sum-rate loss with respect to the full
   coordinated algorithm with much less backhaul information exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Most digital systems operate on a positional representation of data,
   such as binary radix. An alternative is to operate on random bit streams
   where the signal value is encoded by the probability of obtaining a one
   versus a zero. This representation is much less compact than binary
   radix. However, complex operations can be performed with very simple
   logic. Furthermore, since the representation is uniform, with all bits
   weighted equally, it is highly tolerant of soft errors (i.e., bit
   flips). Both combinational and sequential constructs have been proposed
   for operating on stochastic bit streams. Prior work has shown that
   combinational logic can implement multiplication and scaled addition
   effectively while linear finite-state machines (FSMs) can implement
   complex functions such as exponentiation and tanh effectively. Prior
   work on stochastic computation has largely been validated empirically.
   This paper provides a rigorous mathematical treatment of stochastic
   implementation of complex functions such as exponentiation and tanh
   implemented using linear FSMs. It presents two new functions, an
   absolute value function and exponentiation based on an absolute value,
   motivated by specific applications. Experimental results show that the
   linear FSM-based constructs for these functions have smaller area-delay
   products than the corresponding deterministic constructs. They also are
   much more tolerant of soft errors.}},

Title = {{Experimental chemoporoelastic characterization of shale using

Abstract = {{The development of reliable experimental techniques for characterization
   of chemoporomechancial shale-fluid interactions is important for the
   design of drilling fluids that maximize shale stability. In this
   context, testing of millimeter-scale specimens is promising because
   small specimens require shorter test durations and are more readily
   available from offcuts of preserved core or potentially from drill
   cuttings or wellbore cave-in material than larger core plugs that are
   required for more conventional experimentation. Here we present
   experiments wherein we measure the axial displacement of 4 mm long by 4
   mm diameter cylindrical shale specimens that are subjected firstly to a
   mechanical axial loading and then to an osmotic loading associated with
   a sudden increase in the salinity of the surrounding fluid. The response
   to both stages of loading is consistent with theoretical,
   chemoporoelastic predictions. In particular, the model predicts two
   types of behavior depending on the ratio between the reflection
   coefficient and the so-called chemomechanical coupling coefficient that
   quantifies the volumetric strain as a result of a change in ion content.
   Consistent with predictions, both monotonic shrinkage and initial
   shrinkage followed by partial recovery are observed in our testing
   campaign which includes 20 shales from a variety of geological settings.
   Quantitative characterization is also carried out by selecting
   chemoporoelastic parameter values that minimize the mismatch between the
   data and the model. The results show that the reflection coefficient and
   the chemomechanical coupling parameter are correlated with each other
   and with both the Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC) and the Specific
   Surface Area (SSA). Based on the consistency of the data from test to
   test and with the model, together with the fact that the key
   chemoporoelastic coefficients are sensibly correlated with CEC and SSA,
   we conclude that these millimeter-scale experiments are able to provide
   useful characterization for better understanding and predicting
   shale-fluid interactions. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Plant agriculture is poised at a technological inflection point. Recent
   advances in genome engineering make it possible to precisely alter DNA
   sequences in living cells, providing unprecedented control over a

   engineering include those that better withstand pests, that have
   enhanced nutritional value, and that are able to grow on marginal lands.
   In many instances, crops with such traits will be created by altering
   only a few nucleotides among the billions that comprise plant genomes.
   As such, and with the appropriate regulatory structures in place, crops
   created through genome engineering might prove to be more acceptable to
   the public than plants that carry foreign DNA in their genomes. Public

Abstract = {{High-frequency (HF) activity represents a potential biomarker of the
   epileptogenic zone in epilepsy patients, the removal of which is
   considered to be crucial for seizure-free surgical outcome. We proposed
   a high frequency source imaging (HFSI) approach to noninvasively image
   the brain sources of the scalp-recorded HF EEG activity. Both computer
   simulation and clinical patient data analysis were performed to
   investigate the feasibility of using the HFSI approach to image the
   sources of HF activity from noninvasive scalp EEG recordings. The HF
   activity was identified from high-density scalp recordings after
   high-pass filtering the EEG data and the EEG segments with HF activity
   were concatenated together to form repetitive HF activity. Independent
   component analysis was utilized to extract the components corresponding
   to the HF activity. Noninvasive EEG source imaging using realistic
   geometric boundary element head modeling was then applied to image the
   sources of the pathological HF brain activity. Five medically
   intractable focal epilepsy patients were studied and the estimated
   sources were found to be concordant with the surgical resection or
   intracranial recordings of the patients. The present study demonstrates,
   for the first time, that source imaging from the scalp HF activity could
   help to localize the seizure onset zone and provide a novel noninvasive
   way of studying the epileptic brain in humans. This study also indicates
   the potential application of studying HF activity in the presurgical
   planning of medically intractable epilepsy patients.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is a
   noninvasive electrical conductivity imaging approach that measures
   ultrasound wave induced by magnetic stimulation, for reconstructing the
   distribution of electrical impedance in a biological tissue. Existing
   reconstruction algorithms for MAT-MI are based on the assumption that
   the acoustic properties in the tissue are homogeneous. However, the
   tissue in most parts of human body has heterogeneous acoustic
   properties, which leads to potential distortion and blurring of small
   buried objects in the impedance images. In this study, we proposed a new
   algorithm for MAT-MI to image the impedance distribution in tissues with
   inhomogeneous acoustic speed distributions. With a computer head model
   constructed from MR images of a human subject, a series of numerical
   simulation experiments were conducted. The present results indicate that

Abstract = {{Neuronal oscillations reflect the activity of neuronal ensembles engaged
   in integrative cognition, and may serve as a functional measure for the
   cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. This study aims to reveal the
   abnormal amplitude dynamics of electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations
   in schizophrenia patients on multiple time scales. EEGs were recorded
   from schizophrenia patients (n = 19) and healthy controls (n = 16) while
   they were at resting state with eyes closed, at resting state with eyes
   open, and at watching video. Detrended fluctuation analysis and measures
   of life-time and waiting-time were used to characterize the abnormal
   dynamics of EEG oscillations on both long (1-20 s) and short (<= 1 s)
   time scales. Abnormal dynamics of EEG oscillations in alpha and beta
   bands were observed. In particular, compared with healthy controls,
   schizophrenia patients have smaller DFA exponent (implying weaker
   long-range temporal correlation) in the left fronto-temporal area and
   smaller DFA exponent, smaller life-time (indicating shorter oscillation
   burst), and smaller waiting-time in the occipital area in beta band at
   resting state with eyes open. In addition, schizophrenia patients have
   larger DFA exponent, larger life-time, and larger waiting-time at some
   clustered channels in the temporo-parietal area in alpha band at
   watching video. The present results provide new insights for cognitive
   deficits and the underlying neuronal dysfunction in schizophrenia.}},

Abstract = {{Design for reliability is an increasingly important design step at
   advanced technology nodes. Aggressive scaling has brought forth
   reliability issues, such as negative bias temperature instability
   (NBTI). The aging process due to NBTI exhibits a significant amount of
   variability for a single device and for multiple devices. As a result,
   long-term reliability prediction from short-term stress measurement
   becomes dramatically challenging. With increasing reliability concerns,
   accurate statistical aging prediction is essential in order to develop
   robust guard banding and protection strategies during the design stage.
   To develop an accurate long-term prediction method under variations,
   this paper first collects statistical device data from a 65-nm test chip
   with a resolution of 0.2 mV in the threshold voltage Vth measurement.
   Comparing the aging prediction from short-term stress data (< 20 k
   second) with the direct long-term measurement (up to 200 k second), we
   conclude that: 1) the aging in a pMOS device follows logarithmic time
   dependence rather than conventional power law; 2) a traditional t(n)
   model overestimates the aging rate and the variance for long-term
   behavior; and 3) a trapping/detrapping (TD)-based log(t) model correctly
   captures the aging variability due to the randomness in the number of
   initial available traps, and it accurately predicts the mean and the
   variance of the Vth shift. These results guide the development of a new

Abstract = {{A system reconfiguration problem is considered for three-phase power
   distribution networks featuring distributed generation. In lieu of
   binary line selection variables, the notion of group sparsity is
   advocated to re-formulate the nonconvex distribution system
   reconfiguration (DSR) problem into a convex one. It is shown that the
   line selection task boils down to a shrinkage and thresholding operation
   on the line currents. Further, numerical tests illustrate the ability of
   the proposed scheme to identify meshed, weakly meshed, or even radial
   configurations by adjusting a sparsity-tuning parameter in the DSR cost.
   Constraints on the voltages are investigated and incorporated in the
   novel DSR problem to facilitate voltage regulation.}},

Abstract = {{We have derived an expression for the effective absorbing area for
   thermal infrared detectors having non-zero absorption in the support
   legs, which is different from the geometric areas of the constituent
   detector elements. This technique is particularly applicable to devices
   where sensitivity is more important than fill-factor, as opposed to
   standard imaging arrays. The effective area can simply be substituted in
   standard equations to obtain a good estimate of the detector performance
   under uniform flood illumination conditions. The formalism can also be
   used for estimating the contributions of the individual signal
   generating elements to the total measured signal. This approximation has
   been tested for MEMS infrared detectors with thermoelectric readout
   operating under vacuum. The responsivity of the same device calculated
   using the effective area approximation and measured using a tightly
   constrained absorbing area are found to match very closely, within 5\%
   over the most wavelengths and within 15\% at the shortest thermal
   infrared wavelengths.}},

Abstract = {{Silicon anodes are of great interest for advanced lithium-ion battery
   applications due to their order of magnitude higher energy capacity than
   graphite. Below a critical diameter, silicon nanowires enable the
   similar to 300\% volume expansion during lithiation without
   pulverization. However, their high surface-to-volume ratio is believed
   to contribute to fading of their capacity retention during cycling due
   to solid-electrolyte-interphase (SE!) growth on surfaces. To better
   understand this issue, previous studies have examined the composition
   and morphology of the SEI layers. Here we report direct measurements of
   the reduction in silicon nanowire diameter with number of cycles due to
   SEI formation. The results reveal significantly greater Si loss near the
   nanowire base. From the change in silicon volume we can accurately
   predict the measured specific capacity reduction for silicon nanowire
   half cells. The enhanced Si loss near the nanowire/metal current
   collector interface suggests new strategies for stabilizing nanowires
   for long cycle life performance.}},

Abstract = {{The highest efficiency solar cells based on copper zinc tin sulfide
   (CZTS), a promising photovoltaic material comprised of earth abundant
   elements, are built on soda lime glass (SLG), a substrate which contains
   many impurities, including Na and K. These impurities may diffuse into
   CZTS films during processing and affect film structure and properties.
   We have investigated the effects of these impurities on the
   microstructure of CZTS films synthesized by ex situ sulfidation of
   Cu-Zn-Sn alloy films co-sputtered on SLG, Pyrex, and quartz. CZTS films
   synthesized on SLG were found to have significantly larger grains than
   films grown on the other substrates. Furthermore, we show that by
   including a bare additional piece of SLG in the sulfidation ampoule, the
   grain size of films grown on nominally impurity-free quartz increases
   from 100's of nm to greater than 1 mm. This demonstrates conclusively
   that impurities in SLG volatilize in S-containing atmospheres and
   incorporate into nearby CZTS films synthesized on other substrates.
   Impurity concentrations in these CZTS films were examined using depth
   profiling with time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (TOF-SIMS). Of all the impurities present in SLG, the TOF-SIMS
   experiments implicated Na, K, and Ca as possible elements responsible
   for the enhanced grain growth. To investigate the effects of these
   impurities individually, we introduced very small and controllable
   amounts of Na, K, or Ca into the sulfidation ampoule during CZTS
   synthesis. Impurity amounts as low as 10(-6) moles of Na or 10(-7) moles
   of K resulted in a dramatic increase in grain size, from 100's of nm to
   several microns, for films deposited on quartz, while Ca loading had no
   visible effect on the final microstructure. Based on this vapor
   transport mechanism, we thus demonstrate an approach for delivering
   precisely controlled amounts of specific impurities into CZTS films on
   arbitrary substrates to facilitate large-grain growth.}},

Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of controlled H-and K-type
   transitions to turbulence in an M D 0 : 2 (where M is the Mach number)
   nominally zero-pressure-gradient and spatially developing flat-plate
   boundary layer are considered. Sayadi, Hamman \& Moin (J. Fluid Mech.,
   vol. 724, 2013, pp. 480-509) showed that with the start of the
   transition process, the skin-friction profiles of these controlled
   transitions diverge abruptly from the laminar value and overshoot the
   turbulent estimation. The objective of this work is to identify the
   structures of dynamical importance throughout the transitional region.
   Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) (Schmid, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 656,
   2010, pp. 5-28) as an optimal phase-averaging process, together with
   triple decomposition (Reynolds \& Hussain, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 54 (02),
   1972, pp. 263-288), is employed to assess the contribution of each
   coherent structure to the total Reynolds shear stress. This analysis
   shows that low-frequency modes, corresponding to the legs of hairpin
   vortices, contribute most to the total Reynolds shear stress. The use of
   composite DMD of the vortical structures together with the skin-friction
   coefficient allows the assessment of the coupling between near-wall
   structures captured by the low-frequency modes and their contribution to
   the total skin-friction coefficient. We are able to show that the
   low-frequency modes provide an accurate estimate of the skin-friction
   coefficient through the transition process. This is of interest since
   large-eddy simulation (LES) of the same configuration fails to provide a
   good prediction of the rise to this overshoot. The reduced-order
   representation of the flow is used to compare the LES and the DNS
   results within this region. Application of this methodology to the LES
   of the H-type transition illustrates the effect of the grid resolution
   and the subgrid-scale model on the estimated shear stress of these
   low-frequency modes. The analysis shows that although the shapes and
   frequencies of the low-frequency modes are independent of the
   resolution, the amplitudes are underpredicted in the LES, resulting in
   underprediction of the Reynolds shear stress.}},

Volume = {{748}},
Pages = {{368-398}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A zero pressure gradient turbulent boundary layer of Re-tau = 2500 was
   perturbed by a single spanwise array of finite cylinders mounted on the
   bounding surface and extending through the logarithmic region. The
   cylinder height was H/delta = 0.2 (H+ = 500), where delta is the
   boundary layer thickness, with an aspect ratio (Lambda R) (height/
   diameter) of four. Streamwise-spanwise (x-y) planes of the flow were
   examined by particle image velocimetry (PIV) up to 7 delta downstream at
   a wall-normal location of z(+) = 300 for cylinder array spacings ranging
   from 0.2 delta to 0.8 delta. Average streamwise velocity fields showed a
   splitting, then merging pattern of cylinder wakes which occurred further
   downstream as the cylinder spacing increased. Based on measurements at
   the furthest downstream location, both the spanwise variation of average
   streamwise velocity and the Fourier content in the instantaneous fields
   suggested that the case with 0.6 delta cylinder spacing, which matched
   the dominant spanwise scale in the unperturbed flow, yielded the most
   persistent downstream flow organization. A flying PIV method was
   implemented to track specific packet structures over a range -2< x/delta
   < 7 with respect to the cylinder array, corresponding to a time scale of
   12.4/U-delta Packets approaching the 0.2 delta spacing array first lost
   their organization but then regained it a distance 2 delta downstream,

Abstract = {{We study the transition of a Mach 6 laminar boundary layer due to an
   isolated cylindrical roughness element using large- scale direct
   numerical simulations (DNS). Three flow conditions, corresponding to
   experiments conducted at the Purdue Mach 6 quiet wind tunnel are
   simulated. Solutions are obtained using a high-order, low-dissipation
   scheme for the convection terms in the Navier-Stokes equations. The
   lowest Reynolds number (Re) case is steady, whereas the two higher Re
   cases break down to a quasi-turbulent state. Statistics from the highest
   Re case show the presence of a wedge of fully developed turbulent flow
   towards the end of the domain. The simulations do not employ forcing of
   any kind, apart from the roughness element itself, and the results
   suggest a self-sustaining mechanism that causes the flow to transition
   at a sufficiently large Reynolds number. Statistics, including spectra,
   are compared with available experimental data. Visualizations of the
   flow explore the dominant and dynamically significant flow structures:
   the upstream shock system, the horseshoe vortices formed in the upstream
   separated boundary layer and the shear layer that separates from the top
   and sides of the cylindrical roughness element. Streamwise and spanwise
   planes of data were used to perform a dynamic mode decomposition (DMD)}},

Abstract = {{The performance of completely biological, decellularized engineered
   allografts in a sheep model was evaluated to establish clinical
   potential of these unique arterial allografts. The 4-mm-diameter,
   2-3-cm-long grafts were fabricated from fibrin gel remodeled into an
   aligned tissue tube in vitro by ovine dermal fibroblasts.
   Decellularization and subsequent storage had little effect on graft
   properties, with burst pressure exceeding 4000mmHg and the same
   compliance as the ovine femoral artery. Grafts were implanted
   interpositionally in the femoral artery of six sheep (n = 9), with
   contralateral sham controls (n = 3). At 8 weeks (n = 5) and 24 weeks (n
   = 4), all grafts were patent and showed no evidence of dilatation or
   mineralization. Mid-graft lumen diameter was unchanged. Extensive
   recellularization occurred, with most cells expressing alpha SMA.
   Endothelialization was complete by 24 weeks with elastin deposition
   evident. These completely biological grafts possessed circumferential
   alignment/mechanical anisotropy characteristic of native arteries and
   were cultured only 5 weeks prior to decellularization and storage as
   ``off-the-shelf'' grafts.}},

   inhibit movement of common carp}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{95-103}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Although bubble curtains have been proposed many times as practical and
   inexpensive solutions to hinder the movement of invasive fish, few
   studies have examined why or how they might work. By understanding how
   bubble curtains influence fish behavior, management tools could be
   developed to control movement of invasive fish. In this study, the
   common carp (Cyprinus carpio L.) was used to examine the performance of
   three different bubble curtains (fine-, graded-, and coarse-bubble) and
   acoustically enhanced systems in an indoor channel. Trials revealed that
   the graded- and coarse-bubble systems reduced common carp passage across
   the curtain by 75-85\% in both up- and down-stream directions.
   Concurrent acoustic field measurements revealed that these bubble
   curtains generated sound near 200 Hz at approximately 130 dB (ref 1 mu
   Pa), well above the common carp hearing threshold. Further testing with
   speaker arrays and lighting indicated that carp avoidance of the bubble
   curtain involved responses to sound and fluid motion rather than visual
   cues. Although field tests are warranted, our results suggest that
   bubble curtains may be a viable and inexpensive deterrence system to
   limit common carp movement. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{104}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{42-51}},

Abstract = {{Thermotropic materials offer the potential to provide passive overheat
   protection for polymer solar absorbers. These materials are comprised of
   a matrix in which a second material, referred to as the scattering
   domain, is dispersed as small particles. Overheat protection is provided
   by a change in transmittance and reflectance at elevated temperature.
   The magnitude of this change depends on the change in the relative
   refractive index between the matrix and the scattering domain, the
   volume fraction and size of the dispersed particles, and the thickness
   of the material. To predict the effect of these parameters on the
   normal-hemispherical transmittance and reflectance, thermotropic
   materials are modeled as a non-absorbing slab comprised of discrete,
   anisotropic scattering, spherical particles embedded in a matrix
   material. A Monte Carlo ray tracing algorithm predicts the transmittance
   and reflectance of the slab. The model predictions are compared with:
   the analytical solution for a slab of non-absorbing, non-scattering
   media, and the measured transmittance of 0.3 mm thick polymer samples
   containing 400 nm particles. A parametric study of the effects of the
   design parameters on the transmittance is presented to identify
   potential material combinations which will produce a thermotropic
   composite capable of providing overheat protection for fiat plate solar
   collectors. Relatively short chain alkanes or low molecular mass
   polyethylene in a matrix of polycarbonate are identified as promising
   materials. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Although the number of new cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) has
   increased rapidly in the last few decades, the molecular basis of its
   pathogenesis is not completely understood. Activation of the Hedgehog
   (Hh) signaling pathway has been shown to be a key factor driving the
   development of BCC. The Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway was also
   shown to be activated in BCCs and to perhaps modulate the activity of
   the Hh pathway. We have previously identified a mechanism by which Wnt
   signaling regulates the transcriptional outcome of the Hh signaling
   pathway. We demonstrated that coding region determinant-binding protein
   (CRD-BP), a direct target of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, binds to GM
   mRNA, stabilizes it, and consequently upregulates its levels (mRNA and
   protein) and activities. We hypothesized that Wnt-induced and
   CRD-BP-dependent regulation of GEM expression and activities is
   important for the development of BCC. In this study, we show that CRD-BP
   is overexpressed in BCC and that its expression positively correlates
   with the activation of both Wnt and Hh signaling pathways. We also
   describe the generation and characterization of a human BCC cell line.
   This cell line was utilized to demonstrate the importance of
   CRD-BP-dependent regulation of GM expression and activities in the
   development of BCC.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeIron-oxide nanoparticles (IONPs) have proven utility as contrast
   agents in many MRI applications. Previous quantitative IONP mapping has
   been performed using mainly T-2{*} mapping methods. However, in
   applications requiring high IONP concentrations, such as magnetic
   nanoparticles based thermal therapies, conventional pulse sequences are
   unable to map T-2{*} because the signal decays too rapidly. In this
   article, sweep imaging with Fourier transformation (SWIFT) sequence is
   combined with the Look-Locker method to map T-1 of IONPs in high
   concentrations.
   MethodsT(1) values of agar containing IONPs in different concentrations
   were measured with the SWIFT Look-Locker method and with inversion
   recovery spectroscopy. Precisions of Look-Locker and variable flip angle
   (VFA) methods were compared in simulations.
   ResultsThe measured R-1 (=1/T-1) has a linear relationship with IONP
   concentration up to 53.6 mM of Fe. This concentration exceeds
   concentrations measured in previous work by almost an order of
   magnitude. Simulations show SWIFT Look-Locker method is also much less
   sensitive to B-1 inhomogeneity than the VFA method.
   ConclusionSWIFT Look-Locker can accurately measure T-1 of IONP
   concentrations 53.6 mM. By mapping T-1 as a function of IONP
   concentration, IONP distribution maps might be used in the future to
   plan effective magnetic nanoparticle hyperthermia therapy. Magn Reson

Abstract = {{Due to increased survival rates among soldiers exposed to explosive
   blasts, blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI) has become much more
   prevalent in recent years. Cerebral vasospasm (CVS) is a common
   manifestation of brain injury whose incidence is significantly increased
   in bTBI. CVS is characterized by initial vascular smooth muscle cell
   (VSMC) hypercontractility, followed by prolonged vessel remodeling and
   lumen occlusion, and is traditionally associated with subarachnoid
   hemorrhage (SAH), but recent results suggest that mechanical injury
   during bTBI can cause mechanotransduced VSMC hypercontractility and
   phenotype switching necessary for CVS development, even in the absence
   of SAH. Here, we review the mechanisms by which mechanical stimulation
   and SAH can synergistically drive CVS progression, complicating
   treatment options in bTBI patients.}},

Title = {{Decomposition of tree leaf litter on pavement: implications for urban

Journal = {{URBAN ECOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{369-385}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Leaf litter may be an important source of nutrients to stormwater and
   ultimately contribute to eutrophication of surface waters associated
   with urbanization. Thus, understanding decomposition and nutrient
   release from leaf litter that falls on impervious surfaces is important
   for stormwater management. However, few studies have examined leaf
   litter decomposition in the unique urban environment of the street
   gutter. We compared decomposition of leaf litter of five street tree
   species in a parking lot gutter in St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. In contrast
   to our expectations, comparisons with past studies revealed that litter
   decomposed more rapidly in the gutter than in nearby natural areas. And
   decomposition rates were as rapid as those measured in other urban
   settings (forests and streams), with most species losing 80 \% of their
   initial mass after 1 year. Litter of most species had retained more than
   half of its initial N and P after 1 year. However, in contrast to N,
   litter P dynamics largely were uncoupled from litter mass dynamics, with
   litter P increasing and decreasing unpredictably over the year.
   Short-term (24 h) laboratory studies revealed that litter had the
   potential to lose a high fraction of its initial P, with high variation
   among species (from 27 to 88 \%), and a smaller fraction of its initial
   N (< 10 \%) via leaching. Thus, street tree species may differ in their
   potential contributions to nutrients that are released during
   decomposition. Our results suggest that careful selection of street tree
   species and timely removal of litterfall have significant potential to
   reduce nutrient fluxes from streets to storm drains, particularly for P.}},

   polymers. Glyceride-based polymers used in self-emulsifying drug
   delivery systems (SEDDS) will also be discussed for its importance in
   formulating poorly water-soluble drugs. Unique features and advantages
   of each type of semi-solid materials are discussed and examples of their

Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{80}},
Pages = {{68-78}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{A stethoscope is the standard clinical tool used for auscultation. It
   amplifies chest sounds and enables diagnosis of both circulatory and
   respiratory systems. However, in many emergency transportation
   environments, ambient noise levels in excess of 90 dB prevent successful
   auscultation. In this paper, data is collected in a U.S. Army Sikorsky
   UH-60 helicopter to analyze the inherent noise present during routine
   aeromedical transport. Data is gathered with a commercially available
   stethoscope retrofitted with an array of accelerometers and microphones.
   Peak acoustic noise levels are recorded in excess of 125 dB and ambient
   vibration levels are measured to be near 0.5 g RMS. The signal-to-noise
   ratio is much below 1 for the entire frequency range of interest in
   auscultation. It is shown using a combination of simulations and
   experimental data that existing active noise cancellation techniques
   using a reference microphone would be ineffective in this scenario.
   However, similar adaptive noise cancellation techniques using a
   reference accelerometer within the device would be significantly more
   effective at enabling auscultation. (c) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Recognizing actions is one of the important challenges in computer
   vision with respect to video data, with applications to surveillance,
   diagnostics of mental disorders, and video retrieval. Compared to other
   data modalities such as documents and images, processing video data
   demands orders of magnitude higher computational and storage resources.
   One way to alleviate this difficulty is to focus the computations to
   informative (salient) regions of the video. In this paper, we propose a
   novel global spatio-temporal self-similarity measure to score saliency
   using the ideas of dictionary learning and sparse coding. In contrast to
   existing methods that use local spatio-temporal feature detectors along
   with descriptors (such as HOG, HOG3D, and HOF), dictionary learning
   helps consider the saliency in a global setting (on the entire video) in
   a computationally efficient way. We consider only a small percentage of
   the most salient (least self-similar) regions found using our algorithm,
   over which spatio-temporal descriptors such as HOG and region covariance
   descriptors are computed. The ensemble of such block descriptors in a
   bag-of-features framework provides a holistic description of the motion
   sequence which can be used in a classification setting. Experiments on
   several benchmark datasets in video based action classification
   demonstrate that our approach performs competitively to the state of the
   art. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A passivity framework for hydraulic actuators is developed by
   considering the compressibility energy function for a fluid with a
   pressure-dependent bulk modulus. It is shown that the typical actuator's
   mechanical and pressure dynamics model can be obtained from the
   Euler-Lagrange equations for this energy function and that the actuator
   is passive with respect to a hydraulic supply rate which contains, in
   addition to the flow work (PQ), the compressibility energy also, which
   has often been ignored. A storage function for the pressure error is
   then proposed and the pressure error dynamics are shown to be a passive
   two-port subsystem. Trajectory tracking control laws are then derived
   using the storage function. A case study is presented to compare the new
   passivity-based approach and the traditional backstepping approach using
   a quadratic pressure error term. In this example, the proposed approach
   has one fewer parameter to tune, is less sensitive to velocity
   measurement error, and requires lower feedback gains than the
   traditional approach.}},

Title = {{Magnetically inhomogeneous ground state below the first-order valence
   transition in (Pr1-yYy)(0.7)Ca0.3CoO3-delta}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},

Abstract = {{Pr-based perovskite cobaltites, such as Pr0.5Ca0.5CoO3-delta and
   (Pr1-yYy)(1-x)CaxCoO3-delta have recently been discovered to undergo a
   first-order metal-insulator transition on cooling, thought to arise from
   an unusual shift in electron occupancy from Pr to hybridized Co-O
   orbitals. While this transition is known to generally suppress
   long-range ferromagnetic ordering, the true nature of the magnetic
   ground state remains unclear. In this work, we have performed
   structural, magnetic, transport, magnetotransport, and small-angle
   neutron scattering measurements on (Pr1-yYy)(0.7)Ca0.3CoO3-delta (0.000
   <= y <= 0.200) in order to develop a complete microscopic picture of the
   ground state and a full appreciation of the evolution of the first-order
   transition with Y doping. Our magnetization and zero-field resistivity
   measurements confirm the presence of an abrupt temperature-dependent
   metal-insulator transition on cooling, accompanied by a sharp drop in
   magnetization, setting in between y = 0.050 and 0.075. Small-angle
   neutron scattering measurements suggest the presence of critical
   ferromagnetic fluctuations above the metal-insulator transition for y =
   0.075, indicating that the system is poised to order ferromagnetically.
   This magnetic scattering is suppressed at the metal-insulator transition
   but reemerges at lower temperatures (below 40-50 K) due to the formation
   of a ferromagnetic cluster state. The clusters have a mean correlation
   length of similar to 50 angstrom at 4 K, although magnetic inhomogeneity
   occurs across a broad spectrum of length scales, evidencing a highly
   inhomogeneous ground state, which we relate to the numerous sources of
   chemical and structural disorder. Interestingly, the magnetically
   inhomogeneous state manifests an intercluster magnetoresistance effect
   and a strong field-cooling effect on the low-temperature transport. We
   interpret these results, quite generally, in terms of the electronic
   shift from Pr to Co driving the system from the ferromagnetic side of
   the generic perovskite cobaltite magnetic phase diagram to the
   insulating side (where ferromagnetic clusters are well known to exist).
   These results thus shed significant light on the formation of the
   magnetically inhomogenous ground state of Pr-based cobaltites undergoing
   a first-order metal-insulator transition and indeed provide clear and
   direct evidence of such.}},

Abstract = {{A potentially low-cost approach for making copper zinc tin sulfide
   (CZTS) solar cells relies on annealing colloidal nanocrystal films cast
   on suitable substrates in a sulfur-containing environment to form thin
   films with micrometer-sized grains. The film microstructure and grain
   size affects the solar cell performance. We conducted a systematic study
   of the factors controlling crystal growth and microstructure development
   during annealing of films cast from colloidal dispersions of CZTS
   nanocrystals. The film microstructure is controlled by concurrent normal
   and abnormal grain growth. At 600 to 800 degrees C and low sulfur
   pressures (50 Torr), abnormal CZTS grains up to 10 mu m in size grow on
   the surface of the CZTS nanocrystal film via transport of material from
   the nanocrystals to the abnormal grains. Meanwhile, the nanocrystals
   coarsen, sinter, and undergo normal grain growth. The driving force for
   abnormal grain growth is the reduction in total energy associated with
   the high surface area nanocrystals. The eventual coarsening of the CZTS
   nanocrystals reduces the driving force for abnormal crystal growth.
   Increasing the sulfur pressure by an order of magnitude to 500 Torr
   accelerates both normal and abnormal crystal growth though sufficient
   acceleration of the former eventually reduces the latter by reducing the
   driving force for abnormal grain growth. For example, at high
   temperatures (700 degrees C) and sulfur pressures (500 Torr) normal
   grains quickly grow to similar to 500 nm which significantly reduces
   abnormal grain growth. The use of soda lime glass as the substrate,
   instead of quartz, accelerates normal grain growth. Normal grains grow
   to similar to 500 nm at lower temperatures and sulfur pressures (i.e.,
   600 degrees C and 50 Torr) than those required to grow the same size
   grains on quartz (700 degrees C and 500 Torr).}},

Abstract = {{When functional films are cast from colloidal dispersions of

   semiconductor nanocrystals such as PbSe are typically considered to be
   insulating. Consequently, these ligands are either removed or replaced
   with short ones to bring the nanocrystals closer to each other for
   increased electronic coupling. Herein, using high-angle annular
   dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging combined
   with electron energy loss spectroscopy, we show that partial oxidation
   of PbSe nanocrystals forms conjugated double bonds within the oleic
   ligands, which then facilitates enhanced plasmonic interaction among the
   nanocrystals. The changes in the geometric configurations of the ligands
   are imaged directly and correlated with the changes in the surface
   plasmon intensities as they oxidize and undergo structural

   Orbital-density dependence in electronic-structure functionals}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{89}},
Number = {{19}},
Month = {{MAY 27}},
Abstract = {{Energy functionals which depend explicitly on orbital densities, rather
   than on the total charge density, appear when applying self-interaction
   corrections to density-functional theory; this is, e.g., the case for
   Perdew-Zunger and Koopmans-compliant functionals. In these formulations
   the total energy is not invariant under unitary rotations of the
   orbitals, and local, orbital-dependent potentials emerge. We argue that
   this is not a shortcoming, and that instead these potentials can
   provide, in a functional form, a simplified quasiparticle approximation
   to the spectral potential, i.e., the local, frequency-dependent
   contraction of the many-body self-energy that is sufficient to describe
   exactly the spectral function. As such, orbital-density-dependent
   functionals have the flexibility to accurately describe both total
   energies and quasiparticle excitations in the electronic-structure
   problem. In addition, and at variance with the Kohn-Sham case,
   orbital-dependent potentials do not require nonanalytic derivative
   discontinuities. We present numerical solutions based on the
   frequency-dependent Sham-Schl ``uter equation to support this view, and
   examine some of the existing functionals in this perspective,
   highlighting the very close agreement between exact and approximate
   orbital-dependent potentials.}},

Abstract = {{The mineralogical constitution of the Earth's mantle dictates the
   geophysical and geochemical properties of this region. Previous models
   of a perovskite-dominant lower mantle have been built on the assumption
   that the entire lower mantle down to the top of the D{''} layer contains
   ferromagnesian silicate {[}(Mg,Fe)SiO3] with nominally 10 mole percent
   Fe. On the basis of experiments in laser-heated diamond anvil cells, at
   pressures of 95 to 101 gigapascals and temperatures of 2200 to 2400
   kelvin, we found that such perovskite is unstable; it loses its Fe and
   disproportionates to a nearly Fe-free MgSiO3 perovskite phase and an
   Fe-rich phase with a hexagonal structure. This observation has
   implications for enigmatic seismic features beyond similar to 2000
   kilometers depth and suggests that the lower mantle may contain
   previously unidentified major phases.}},

Title = {{Fate of Antibiotic Resistance Genes and Class 1 Integrons in Soil
   Microcosms Following the Application of Treated Residual Municipal
   Wastewater Solids}},

Abstract = {{Substantial quantities of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are
   discharged with treated residual municipal wastewater solids and
   subsequently applied to soil. The objective of this work was to
   determine the decay rates for ARGs and class 1 integrons following
   simulated land application of treated wastewater solids. Treated
   residual solids from two full-scale treatment plants were applied to
   sets of triplicate soil microcosms in two independent experiments.
   Experiment 1 investigated loading rates of 20, 40, and 100 g kg(-1) of
   residual solids to a sandy soil, while experiment 2 investigated a
   loading rate of 40 g kg(-1) I to a silty-loamy soil. Five ARGs (erm(B),
   sull, tet(A), tet(W), and tet(X)), the integrase of class 1 integrons
   (intI1), 16S rRNA genes, 16S rRNA genes of all Bacteroides spp., and 16S
   rRNA genes of human-specific Bacteroides spp. were quantified using
   real-time polymerase chain reaction. ARGs and intI1 quantities declined
   in most microcosms, with statistically significant (P < 0.05) half-lives
   varying between 13 d (erm(B), experiment 1, 100 g kg(-1)) and 81 d
   (intI1, experiment 1, 40 g kg(-1)). These kinetic rates were much slower
   than have been previously reported for unit operations used to treat
   wastewater solids (e.g., anaerobic digestion). This research suggests
   that the design and operation of municipal wastewater treatment
   facilities with the explicit goal of mitigating the release of ARGs
   should focus on using technologies within the treatment facility, rather
   than depending on attenuation subsequent to land application.}},

Abstract = {{The main contribution of this work is to propose a design technique for
   state-feedback control of continuous-time piecewise-affine (PWA) systems
   that is robust not only to the system uncertainties, but also to
   variations of the controller gains. More specifically, this study
   presents sufficient conditions to synthesise a robust non-fragile PWA
   controller that exponentially stabilises the closed-loop equilibrium
   point. Furthermore, these conditions are cast as an optimisation problem
   subject to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), which can then be
   solved efficiently. In addition, a set of LMI conditions are derived to
   ensure that the control input will always meet a pre-assigned upper
   bound. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the light emission of crystalline Si nanoparticles (SiNPs)
   with hydrogen and native oxide shell terminations using temperature- and
   time-dependent photoluminescence. We demonstrate that the broad emission
   normally observed for SiNPs after natural oxidation is in fact formed of
   two components, which originate from distinct recombination mechanisms
   that take place simultaneously in the same SiNPs sample. To identify the
   two spectral components, we exploited the different time scales
   associated with different emission mechanisms by carefully choosing the
   measurement time window at which only one of the emission mechanisms is
   active. Moreover, our experiments indicate that one of the emissions is
   due to recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes located in
   the crystalline core of the SiNPs (excitonic emission) whereas the other
   component originates from donor-acceptor recombination pairs involving
   states associated with the native oxide shell. These conclusions are
   supported from experiments carried out with the same SiNPs but where the
   surface-oxide shell is replaced by H termination. We conclude that both
   emission components are excited through electronic states of the SiNPs
   core, pointing out an effective core-to-shell energy/charge transfer.
   Furthermore, we show that the light emission quantum yield of SiNP
   ensembles is strongly affected by inter-NP charge transfer and therefore
   is not determined solely by the properties of the individual NPs. High
   quantum yields of up to 43\%, observed for our surface-oxidized SiNP
   samples in solution, result from inhibition of inter-NP charge transfer.}},

Abstract = {{We derive an analytical solution to the stress concentration factor
   (k(t)) for slightly roughened random surfaces. Topology is assumed to
   possess Gaussian distribution of heights and auto correlation length,
   ACL. For our development, we combine Gao's first-order perturbation
   method, the Hilbert transform, and an energy conservation principal
   related to the Parseval theorem.The root-mean-square (RMS) value of k(t)
   results in a function of the ratio RMS-roughness to ACL. The derived
   formula agrees with experimental results previously reported. The
   results provide insight for more efficient design. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Histiocytic sarcoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that responds poorly
   to therapy. Histiocytic sarcoma is thought to arise from macrophage
   precursor cells via genetic changes that are largely undefined. To
   improve our understanding of the etiology of histiocytic sarcoma we
   conducted a forward genetic screen in mice using the Sleeping Beauty
   transposon as a mutagen to identify genetic drivers of histiocytic
   sarcoma. Sleeping Beauty mutagenesis was targeted to myeloid lineage
   cells using the Lysozyme2 promoter. Mice with activated Sleeping Beauty
   mutagenesis had significantly shortened lifespan and the majority of
   these mice developed tumors resembling human histiocytic sarcoma.
   Analysis of transposon insertions identified 27 common insertion sites
   containing 28 candidate cancer genes. Several of these genes are known
   drivers of hematological neoplasms, like Raf1, Fli1, and Mitf, while
   others are well-known cancer genes, including Nf1, Myc, Jak2, and Pten.
   Importantly, several new potential drivers of histiocytic sarcoma were
   identified and could serve as targets for therapy for histiocytic
   sarcoma patients.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Measurement of Brightness from Living Cells in the Presence
   of Photodepletion}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 12}},
Abstract = {{The brightness of fluorescently labeled proteins provides an excellent
   marker for identifying protein interactions in living cells.
   Quantitative interpretation of brightness, however, hinges on a detailed
   understanding of the processes that affect the signal fluctuation of the
   fluorescent label. Here, we focus on the cumulative influence of
   photobleaching on brightness measurements in cells. Photobleaching
   within the finite volume of the cell leads to a depletion of the
   population of fluorescently labeled proteins with time. The process of
   photodepletion reduces the fluorescence signal which biases the analysis
   of brightness data. Our data show that even small reductions in the
   signal can introduce significant bias into the analysis of the data. We
   develop a model that quantifies the bias and introduce an analysis
   method that accurately determines brightness in the presence of
   photodepletion as verified by experiments with mammalian and yeast
   cells. In addition, photodepletion experiments with the fluorescent
   protein EGFP reveal the presence of a photoconversion process, which
   leads to a marked decrease in the brightness of the EGFP protein. We
   also identify conditions where the effect of EGFP's photoconversion on
   brightness experiments can be safely ignored.}},

   In this study, a scattered field finite difference time domain
   simulation is used to analyze the performance of a lollipop transducer
   in heat assisted magnetic recording on both a patterned FePt media and a
   continuous thin film. To represent wear, sharp corners of the peg are
   approximated with curved ones, which are found to narrow the track width
   without excessive loss of intensity. Compared with continuous media, the
   patterned media exhibits higher energy efficiency and a better
   concentrated optical beam spot. This effect is due to the near field
   effects of patterned media on the performance of the transducer. (C)

Abstract = {{Iron nitride samples in foil shape (free standing, 500 nm in thickness)
   were prepared by a nitrogen ion-implantation method. To facilitate phase
   transformation, the samples were bonded on the substrate followed by a
   post-annealing step. By using two different substrates, single crystal
   Si and GaAs, structural and magnetic properties of iron nitride foil
   samples prepared with different nitrogen ion fluences were
   characterized. alpha `'-Fe16N2 phase in iron nitride foil samples was
   obtained and confirmed by the proposed approach. A hard magnetic
   property with coercivity up to 780 Oe was achieved for the FeN foil
   samples bonded on Si substrate. The feasibility of using nitrogen ion
   implantation techniques to prepare FeN foil samples up to 500 nm
   thickness with a stable martensitic phase under high ion fluences has
   been demonstrated. A possible mechanism was proposed to explain this
   result. This proposed method could potentially be an alternative route
   to prepare rare-earth-free FeN bulk magnets by stacking and pressing
   multiple free-standing thick alpha `'-Fe16N2 foils together. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy has been used to directly observe
   magnetostatically coupled transverse domain walls (TDWs) in a pair of
   closely spaced, curved nanowires (NWs). Kerr images of the precessional
   response of the magnetic domain to either side of the TDW revealed the
   TDW as a minimum in the Kerr signal in the region of closest NW
   separation. When the TDWs were ejected from the NW pair, the minimum in
   the Kerr signal was no longer observed. By imaging this transition, the
   static de-coupling field was estimated to be in the range from 38 to 48
   Oe in good agreement with a simple micromagnetic model. This work
   provides a novel technique by which DC and microwave assisted decoupling
   fields of TDWs may be explored in NW pairs of different width,
   separation, and curvature. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{We have investigated a method for measuring the dimensions of an
   individual multilayered Fe-Ga/Cu nanowire (NW) as it changes with
   induced magnetization. In this study, we demonstrate the proposed
   approach and establish this as a viable method for measuring the
   magnetostrictive behavior of an individual Fe-Ga/Cu NW using atomic
   force microscopy (AFM). When an external magnetic field (similar to 300
   Oe) was applied perpendicular to the NW axis, the NW length appeared
   minimized. When a field (similar to 1000 Oe) was applied parallel to the
   NW axis, the height profile of the NW was found to be higher than in the
   case with no parallel external field. Since both ends of the NW were
   welded to the substrate, the magnetic field induced dimensional change
   of the NW caused deflection of the NW in the upward direction, which was
   significant enough to be detected by AFM. An average height difference
   of 15nm was measured with and without an applied field which was then
   used to calculate the magnetostriction of the multilayered NW. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Partially ordered Fe16N2 thin film with (001) texture is successfully
   grown on a Ag under layer using a facing target sputtering system.
   Fe16N2 phase is formed after post-annealing, which is detected by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). High saturation magnetization (M-s) of Fe16N2 thin
   films is observed by vibrating sample magnetometry. It is found that
   Fe16N2 phase can be stable up to 225 degrees C, which is demonstrated by
   the Fe16N2 finger print peak (002) in XRD. After heating to 250 degrees
   C, the Fe16N2 phase decomposes, which leads to low Ms and soft magnetic
   behavior. To further study Fe16N2 decomposition, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy is performed to detect the binding energy of nitrogen
   atoms. Differences of binding energy corresponding to before and after
   heat treatment show the variation of nitrogen atom in electronic state
   with surrounding Fe atoms, indicating nitrogen atomic migration during
   heat treatment. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The underlying algorithms of the language interface and post-generation

   internal instructions, catches syntactic and semantic errors, and
   performs domain-specific optimization to speed up execution. In addition
   to generating reaction networks, RING allows post-processing analysis
   options to: (a) obtain reaction pathways and overall mechanisms from
   initial reactants to desired products using graph traversal algorithms,
   (b) group together isomers to reduce the size of the network through a
   novel molecule hashing technique, (c) calculate thermochemical
   quantities through semi-empirical methods such as group additivity, and

Abstract = {{The advent of Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALENs),
   and similar technologies such as CRISPR, provide a straightforward and
   cost effective option for targeted gene knockout (KO). Yet, there is
   still a need for methods that allow for enrichment and isolation of
   modified cells for genetic studies and therapeutics based on gene
   modified human cells. We have developed and validated two methods for
   simple enrichment and isolation of single or multiplex gene KO's in
   transformed, immortalized, and human progenitor cells. These methods
   rely on selection of a phenotypic change such as resistance to a
   particular drug or ability to grow in a selective environment. The first
   method, termed co-transposition, utilizes integration of a piggyBac
   transposon vector encoding a drug resistance gene. The second method,
   termed co-targeting, utilizes TALENs to KO any gene that when lost
   induces a selectable phenotype. Using these methods we also show removal
   of entire genes and demonstrate that TALENs function in human CD34(+)
   progenitor cells. Further, cotransposition can be used to generate
   conditional KO cell lines utilizing an inducible cDNA rescue transposon
   vector. These methods allow for robust enrichment and isolation of KO
   cells in a rapid and efficient manner.}},

   Method}},
Journal = {{Jove-Journal of Visualized Experiments}},
Year = {{2014}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Lipid bilayer membranes form the plasma membranes of cells and define
   the boundaries of subcellular organelles. In nature, these membranes are
   heterogeneous mixtures of many types of lipids, contain membrane-bound
   proteins and are decorated with carbohydrates. In some experiments, it
   is desirable to decouple the biophysical or biochemical properties of
   the lipid bilayer from those of the natural membrane. Such cases call
   for the use of model systems such as giant vesicles, liposomes or
   supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). Arrays of SLBs are particularly
   attractive for sensing applications and mimicking cell-cell
   interactions. Here we describe a new method for forming SLB arrays.
   Submicron-diameter SiO2 beads are first coated with lipid bilayers to
   form spherical SLBs (SSLBs). The beads are then deposited into an array
   of microfabricated submicron-diameter microwells. The preparation
   technique uses a ``squeegee{''} to clean the substrate surface, while
   leaving behind SSLBs that have settled into microwells. This method
   requires no chemical modification of the microwell substrate, nor any
   particular targeting ligands on the SSLB. Microwells are occupied by
   single beads because the well diameter is tuned to be just larger than
   the bead diameter. Typically, more 75\% of the wells are occupied, while
   the rest remain empty. In buffer SSLB arrays display long-term stability
   of greater than one week. Multiple types of SSLBs can be placed in a
   single array by serial deposition, and the arrays can be used for
   sensing, which we demonstrate by characterizing the interaction of
   cholera toxin with ganglioside GM1. We also show that phospholipid
   vesicles without the bead supports and biomembranes from cellular
   sources can be arrayed with the same method and cell-specific membrane
   lipids can be identified.}},

Abstract = {{Foaming in deep manure pits beneath swine buildings has become a serious
   safety concern during the past few years in the Midwestern U.S. In
   addition to the loss of manure storage capacity, this foaming creates a
   serious safety risk of flash fires and explosions. In order to
   understand the mechanism of manure foaming, manure samples taken from
   foaming and non-foaming pits were studied to reveal potential causes.
   Among various compositional components found in the foaming and
   non-foaming manure samples, long-chain fatty acids (LCFA) were found to
   be a major contributing factor. Adding or removing LCFA in swine manure
   samples led to a significant change in their foaming capability. A
   significantly higher concentration of LCFA was also detected in the foam
   layers of foaming manure samples. LCFA surfactants are stimulating
   foaming, and the sources of these surfactants need to be determined in
   order to develop long-term mitigation plans for manure foaming.}},

Abstract = {{Recent simulations by Chen and Dorfman {[}Electrophoresis 35, 405-411
   (2014)] suggested that ``tilting{''} the electric field with respect to
   the lattice vectors of a hexagonal post array would lead to a
   substantial improvement in electrophoretic DNA separations therein. We
   constructed such an array where the electric field is applied at an
   angle equidistant between the two lattice vectors. This tilted array
   leads to (i) baseline resolution of 20 kbp DNA and lambda DNA (48.5 kbp)
   in a 4mm channel and (ii) measurable separation resolutions for electric
   fields up to 50 V/cm, both of which are improvements over untilted post
   arrays of the same post density. The predicted time required to reach a
   resolution of unity is approximately 5 min, independent of electric
   field. The separations are more reproducible at higher fields. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) can store secret keys in integrated
   circuits (ICs) by exploiting the uncontrollable randomness due to
   manufacturing process variations. These PUFs can be used for
   authentication of devices and for key generation in security
   applications. This paper presents a rigorous statistical analysis of
   various types of multiplexer-based (MUX-based) PUFs including the
   original MUX PUF, the feed-forward MUX PUFs, the modified feed-forward
   MUX PUFs, and multiplexer-demultiplexer (MUX/DeMUX) PUF. The modified
   feed-forward MUX PUF structure is a new structure that is introduced in
   this paper. Three types of feed-forward PUFs are analyzed in this paper.
   These include feed-forward overlap, feed-forward cascade and
   feed-forward separate. The performance analysis quantifies interchip and
   intrachip variations as a function of the number of stages, the process
   variation variance, the environmental noise variance, and the arbiter
   skew for different PUFs. Three other metrics of performance are also
   introduced and analyzed in this paper, which include reliability,
   uniqueness, and randomness. A PUF is more reliable if it has less
   intrachip variation. A PUF is more unique if the interchip variation is
   closer to 50\%. A PUF is more random if its response bit is 0 or 1 with
   equal probability. Our statistical analysis shows that the intrachip
   variation is less dependent on the number of stages, N, if N is greater
   than ten. However, the interchip variation is dependent on N if N is
   less than 100. It is shown that the feed-forward PUFs have higher
   intrachip variation than MUX PUFs; however, the modified feed-forward
   PUFs have significantly lower intrachip variation than the feed-forward
   PUFs. It is shown that the modified feed-forward cascade MUX PUF has the
   best uniqueness and randomness, while the original MUX PUF has the best
   reliability. The analysis presented in this paper can be used by the
   designer to choose an appropriate PUF based on the application's
   requirement. This eliminates the need for fabrication and testing of
   many PUFs for selecting an appropriate PUF.}},

Abstract = {{CPG (CO2 Plume Geothermal) energy systems use CO2 to extract thermal
   energy from naturally permeable geologic formations at depth. CO2 has
   advantages over brine: high mobility, low solubility of amorphous
   silica, and higher density sensitivity to temperature. The density of
   CO2 changes substantially between geothermal reservoir and surface
   plant, resulting in a buoyancy-driven convective current - a
   thermosiphon - that reduces or eliminates pumping requirements. We
   estimated and compared the strength of this thermosiphon for CO2 and for
   20 weight percent NaCl brine for reservoir depths up to 5 km and
   geothermal gradients of 20, 35, and 50 degrees C/km. We found that
   through the reservoir, CO2 has a pressure drop approximately 3- 12 times
   less than brine at the same mass flowrate, making the CO2 thermosiphon
   sufficient to produce power using reservoirs as shallow as 0.5 km. At
   2.5 km depth with a 35 degrees C/km gradient the approximate western
   U.S. continental mean - the CO2 thermosiphon converted approximately
   10\% of the energy extracted from the reservoir to fluid circulation,
   compared to less than 1\% with brine, where additional mechanical
   pumping is necessary. We found CO2 is a particularly advantageous
   working fluid at depths between 0.5 km and 3 km. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The physical nature of the bacterial chromosome has important
   implications for its function. Using high-resolution dynamic tracking,
   we observe the existence of rare but ubiquitous `rapid movements' of
   chromosomal loci exhibiting near-ballistic dynamics. This suggests that
   these movements are either driven by an active machinery or part of
   stress-relaxation mechanisms. Comparison with a null physical model for
   subdiffusive chromosomal dynamics shows that rapid movements are
   excursions from a basal subdiffusive dynamics, likely due to driven
   and/or stress-relaxation motion. Additionally, rapid movements are in
   some cases coupled with known transitions of chromosomal segregation.
   They do not co-occur strictly with replication, their frequency varies
   with growth condition and chromosomal coordinate, and they show a
   preference for longitudinal motion. These findings support an emerging
   picture of the bacterial chromosome as off-equilibrium active matter and
   help developing a correct physical model of its in vivo dynamic
   structure.}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{Long-term prediction of environmental response to natural and
   anthropogenic disturbances in a basin becomes highly uncertain using
   physically based distributed models, particularly when transport time
   scales range from tens to thousands of years, such as for sediment. Yet,
   such predictions are needed as changes in one part of a basin now might
   adversely affect other parts of the basin in years to come. In this
   paper, we propose a simplified network-based predictive framework of
   sedimentological response in a basin, which incorporates network
   topology, channel characteristics, and transport-process dynamics to
   perform a nonlinear process-based scaling of the river-network width
   function to a time-response function. We develop the process-scaling
   formulation for transport of mud, sand, and gravel, using simplifying
   assumptions including neglecting long-term storage, and apply the
   methodology to the Minnesota River Basin. We identify a robust bimodal
   distribution of the sedimentological response for sand of the basin
   which we attribute to specific source areas, and identify a resonant
   frequency of sediment supply where the disturbance of one area followed
   by the disturbance of another area after a certain period of time, may
   result in amplification of the effects of sediment inputs which would be
   otherwise difficult to predict. We perform a sensitivity analysis to
   test the robustness of the proposed formulation to model parameter
   uncertainty and use observations of suspended sediment at several
   stations in the basin to diagnose the model. The proposed framework has
   identified an important vulnerability of the Minnesota River Basin to
   spatial and temporal structuring of sediment delivery.}},

   using hold logic to differentiate between the two cases. However, they
   may experience significant throughput losses due to the effects of
   process variations. We develop a combined presilicon-postsilicon
   technique for variation-aware VLU design that ensures high throughputs
   across all manufactured chips. We achieve this by identifying path
   clusters at the presilicon stage, such that each element of a path
   cluster is likely to be similarly critical in a manufactured part. We
   use sensors to determine which path clusters is critical at the
   postsilicon stage and then activate the appropriate hold logics.
   Practically, for a small number of path clusters, significant
   improvements in throughput are achievable. On a set of 32-nm PTM-based
   ISCAS89 circuits, our scheme offers 15.1\% throughput enhancements with
   only 3.3\% area overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic fracturing is a method of oil and gas extraction from shale in
   which substantial volumes of water return to the surface containing
   chemicals and microorganisms. This paper begins to address the microbial
   composition and aqueous chemistry and the potential for intrinsic and
   enhanced bioremediation of these waters. The waters from a gas and oil
   shale in the Marcellus and Bakken regions, respectively, were analyzed
   for inorganic elements, organic chemicals, microbial taxonomic
   composition, and biodegradative capabilities. The waters were highly
   saline, reaching NaCl concentrations up to 3.5 N, but no significant
   levels of radioactive elements were detected. More than 1,000 organic
   compounds were separated and identified by comprehensive two-dimensional
   gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The major classes
   of organic compounds, in order of decreasing abundance, were aliphatics,
   cycloaliphatics, single-ring aromatics, and polycyclic aromatic
   compounds. The bacterial genera found natively in the waters were
   identified by sequencing the 16S rRNA genes within the extracted DNA.
   The major genera identified included strains known to thrive under
   saline conditions (Halanaerobium, Marinobacter, Oceanimonas,
   Streptohalobacillus) and degrade petroleum hydrocarbons (Thauera,
   Pseudomonas, Marinobacterium, Williamsia, Colwellia). Microbial
   populations were extracted from the Bakken shale waters, encapsulated
   within silica gels, and then reintroduced into their waters of origin.
   Both intrinsic biodegradation from the free native microorganisms and
   enhanced biodegradation with the addition of encapsulated bacteria were
   observed. In total, this paper begins to better define the properties of
   waters derived from hydraulic fracturing and suggests a potential for
   the application of bioremediation to remove organic contaminants. (C)

Abstract = {{The non- local spin-valve is pivotal in spintronics, enabling separation
   of charge and spin currents, disruptive potential applications and the
   study of pressing problems in the physics of spin injection and
   relaxation. Primary among these problems is the perplexing
   non-monotonicity in the temperature-dependent spin accumulation in
   non-local ferromagnetic/non-magnetic metal structures, where the spin
   signal decreases at low temperatures. Here we show that this effect is
   strongly correlated with the ability of the ferromagnetic to form dilute
   local magnetic moments in the NM. This we achieve by studying a
   significantly expanded range of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic combinations.
   We argue that local moments, formed by ferromagnetic/non-magnetic
   interdiffusion, suppress the injected spin polarization and diffusion
   length via a manifestation of the Kondo effect, thus explaining all
   observations. We further show that this suppression can be completely
   quenched, even at interfaces that are highly susceptible to the effect,
   by insertion of a thin non-moment-supporting interlayer.}},

   a planar substrate}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{747}},
Pages = {{119-140}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Characteristic substrate speeds and meniscus shapes associated with the
   onset of air entrainment are studied during dynamic wetting failure
   along a planar substrate. Using high-speed video, the behaviour of the
   dynamic contact line (DCL) is recorded as a tape substrate is drawn
   through a bath of a glycerol/water solution. Air entrainment is
   identified by triangular air films that elongate from the DCL above some
   critical substrate speed. Meniscus confinement within a narrow gap
   between the substrate and a stationary plate is shown to delay air
   entrainment to higher speeds for a wide range of liquid viscosities,
   expanding upon the findings of Vandre, Carvalho \& Kumar (J. Fluid
   Mech., vol. 707, 2012, pp. 496-520). A pressurized liquid reservoir
   controls the meniscus position within the confinement gap. It is found
   that liquid pressurization further postpones air entrainment when the
   meniscus is located near a sharp corner along the stationary plate.
   Meniscus shapes recorded near the DCL demonstrate that operating
   conditions influence the size of entrained air films, with smaller films
   appearing in the more viscous solutions. Regardless of size, air films
   become unstable to thickness perturbations and ultimately rupture,
   leading to the entrainment of air bubbles. Recorded critical speeds and
   air-film sizes compare well to predictions from a hydrodynamic model for
   dynamic wetting failure, suggesting that strong air stresses near the
   DCL trigger the onset of air entrainment.}},

Title = {{Fluid flow and scalar transport through porous fins}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Lotus-type porous metals are a promising alternative for compact heat
   transfer applications. In lotus-type porous fins, jet impingement and
   transverse mixing play important roles for heat transfer: jets emerging
   from the pores impinge on the following fin and enhance heat transfer
   performance, while the transverse fluid motion advects heat away from
   the fin surface. By means of magnetic resonance imaging we have
   performed mean flow and scalar transport measurements through scaled-up
   replicas of two kinds of lotus-type porous fins: one with a
   deterministic hole pattern and staggered alignment, and one with a
   random hole pattern, but the same porosity and mean pore diameter. The
   choice of geometric parameters (fin spacing, thickness, porosity, and
   hole diameter) is based on previous thermal studies. The Reynolds number
   based on the mean pore diameter and inner velocity ranges from 80 to
   3800. The measurements show that in the random hole pattern the jet
   characteristic length scale is substantially larger with respect to the
   staggered hole pattern. The random geometry also produces long coherent
   vortices aligned with the streamwise direction, which improves the
   transverse mixing. The random hole distribution causes the time mean
   streamlines to meander in a random-walk manner, and the diffusivity
   coefficient associated to the mechanical dispersion (which is nominally
   zero in the staggered hole configuration) is several times larger than
   the fluid molecular diffusivity at the higher Reynolds numbers. From the
   trends in maximum streamwise velocity, streamwise vorticity, and
   mechanical diffusivity, it is inferred that the flow undergoes a
   transition to an unsteady/turbulent regime around Reynolds number 300.
   This is supported by the measurements of concentration of an isokinetic
   non-buoyant plume of scalar injected upstream of the stack of fins. The
   total scalar diffusivity for the fully turbulent regime is found to be
   22 times larger than the molecular diffusivity, but only 6 times higher
   than the mechanical diffusivity, indicating that the latter plays a
   significant role for heat transfer and mixing. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Title = {{Rovibrational coupling in molecular nitrogen at high temperature: An
   atomic-level study}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This article contains an atomic-level numerical investigation of
   rovibrational relaxation in molecular nitrogen at high temperature
   (>4000 K), neglecting dissociation. We conduct our study with the use of
   pure Molecular Dynamics (MD) and Classical Trajectory Calculations (CTC)
   Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC), verified to produce statistically
   identical results at the conditions of interest here. MD and CTC DSMC
   solely rely on the specification of a potential energy surface: in this
   work, the site-site Ling-Rigby potential. Additionally, dissociation is
   prevented by modeling the N-N bond either as a harmonic or an anharmonic
   spring. The selected molecular model was shown to (i) recover the shear
   viscosity (obtained from equilibrium pure MD Green-Kubo calculations) of
   molecular nitrogen over a wide range of temperatures, up to
   dissociation; (ii) predict well the near-equilibrium rotational
   relaxation behavior of N-2; (iii) reproduce vibrational relaxation times
   in excellent accordance with the Millikan-White correlation and previous
   semi-classical trajectory calculations in the low temperature range,
   i.e., between 4000 K and 10 000 K. By simulating isothermal relaxations
   in a periodic box, we found that the traditional two-temperature model
   assumptions become invalid at high temperatures (> 10 000 K), due to a
   significant coupling between rotational and vibrational modes for bound
   states. This led us to add amodification to both the Jeans and the
   Landau-Teller equations to include a coupling term, essentially
   described by an additional relaxation time for internal energy
   equilibration. The degree of anharmonicity of the N-2 bond determines
   the strength of the rovibrational coupling. Although neglecting N-2
   dissociation only provides a partial description of a nitrogen system at
   very high temperatures, high-energy trends for bound-bound transitions
   are essential to understand nonequilibrium gas flows, with possible
   implications on rovibration/chemistry interaction at the onset of N-2
   dissociation. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Molecular Weight Dependence of Zero-Shear Viscosity in Atactic
   Polypropylene Bottlebrush Polymers}},

Volume = {{3}},

Abstract = {{-A series of bottlebrush polymers with atactic polypropylene side chains
   were synthesized via ring-opening metathesis polymerization using
   Grubbs' third-generation catalyst (H(2)IMes)(3-BrPy)(2)(Cl)(2)Ru=CHPh.
   Polymers were prepared with fixed side chain length and variable
   backbone degree of polymerization (DP) ranging from 11 to 732 (M-w =
   22-1500 kg/mol) and include the largest reported polyolefin-based
   bottlebrush polymers. The zero-shear viscosity of each polymer sample
   was measured using small-amplitude oscillatory shear measurements. Power
   law fits of zero-shear viscosity (eta(0)) versus weight-average molar
   mass (eta(0) similar to M-w(alpha)) revealed distinct regimes with
   differing molecular weight dependences. A weak dependence (alpha < 0.5)
   was observed at low molecular weight due to the increasingly compact
   nature of short bottlebrush polymers with the continued addition of side
   chains. The scaling transitioned to Rouse-like dynamics (alpha = 1.2) at
   high molecular weight as a consequence of a sphere-to-cylinder
   conformational change with increasing DP of the bottlebrush backbone.}},

Abstract = {{We present an implementation of super-large-scale particle image
   velocimetry (SLPIV) to characterize spatially the turbulent atmospheric
   boundary layer using natural snowfall as flow tracers. The SLPIV
   technique achieves a measurement area of similar to 22 m 9 52 m, up to
   56 m above the ground, with a spatial resolution of similar to 0.34 m.
   The traceability of snow particles is estimated based on their settling
   velocity obtained from the wall-normal component of SLPIV velocity
   measurements. The results are validated using coincident measurements
   from sonic anemometers on a meteorological tower situated in close
   proximity to the SLPIV sampling area. A contrast of the mean velocity
   and the streamwise Reynolds stress component obtained from the two
   techniques shows less than 3 and 12 \% difference, respectively.
   Additionally, the turbulent energy spectra measured by SLPIV show a
   similar inertial subrange and trends when compared to those measured by
   the sonic anemometers.}},

Abstract = {{Although many studies have measured denitrification in stream sediments,
   few have utilized these data with local water column and sediment
   measurements to develop a predictive model for NO3- uptake. In this
   study, sediment denitrification was measured from cores in five streams
   under various land uses in south-central Minnesota using denitrification
   enzyme activity (DEA) assays and amplification of the nirS gene via
   real-time, quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Hydraulic and
   environmental variables were measured in the vicinity of the sediment
   cores to evaluate the influence of fluid flow and chemical variables on
   denitrification activity. Potential denitrification rates measured using
   DEA assays ranged from 0.02 to 10.1 mg N m(-2) h(-1), and the abundance
   of the denitrifier gene nirS was positively correlated with these
   measurements (R-2 = 0.79, P < 0.001) for most of the streams studied. A
   predictive model to determine NO3- uptake via denitrification was
   derived, implementing dimensional analysis of variables that mediate
   denitrification in sand-bed streams. The proposed model explained 75\%
   of the variability in DEA rates. The results of this study show that
   denitrification is most dependent on the distribution of sediment
   organic matter, interstitial pore space, and stream hydraulic
   characteristics, including shear velocity at the sediment-water
   interface and stream depth.}},

Abstract = {{Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (GCSF) drives the production of
   myeloid progenitor and precursor cells toward neutrophils via the GCSF
   receptor (GCSFR, gene name CSF3R). Children with severe congenital
   neutropenia chronically receive pharmacologic doses of GCSF, and similar
   to 30\% will develop myelodysplasia/ acute myeloid leukemia (AML)
   associated with GCSFR truncation mutations. In addition to mutations,
   multiple isoforms of CSF3R have also been reported. We found elevated
   expression of the alternatively spliced isoform, class IV CSF3R in adult
   myelodysplastic syndrome/AML patients. Aside from its association with
   monosomy 7 and higher rates of relapse in pediatric AML patients, little
   is known about the biology of the class IV isoform. We found
   developmental regulation of CSF3R isoforms with the class IV expression
   more representative of a progenitor cell stage. Striking differences
   were found in phosphoprotein signaling involving Janus kinase
   (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and cell
   cycle gene expression. Enhanced proliferation by class IV GCSFR was
   associated with diminished STAT3 and STAT5 activation, yet showed
   sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors. Alterations in the C-terminal domain of
   the GCSFR result in leukemic properties of enhanced growth, impaired
   differentiation and resistance to apoptosis, suggesting that they can
   behave as oncogenic drivers, sensitive to JAK2 inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{Gradient fields of optical, magnetic, or electrical origin are widely
   used for the manipulation of micro-and nanoscale objects. Among various
   device geometries to generate gradient forces, sharp metallic tips are
   one of the most effective. Surface roughness and asperities present on
   traditionally produced tips reduce trapping efficiencies and limit
   plasmonic applications. Template-stripped, noble metal surfaces and
   structures have sub-nm roughness and can overcome these limits. We have
   developed a process using a mix of conductive and dielectric epoxies to
   mount templatestripped gold pyramids on tungsten wires that can be
   integrated with a movable stage. When coupled with a transparent indium
   tin oxide (ITO) electrode, the conductive pyramidal tip functions as a
   movable three dimensional dielectrophoretic trap which can be used to
   manipulate submicrometer-scale particles. We experimentally demonstrate
   the electrically conductive functionality of the pyramidal tip by
   dielectrophoretic manipulation of fluorescent beads and concentration of
   single-walled carbon nanotubes, detected with fluorescent microscopy and
   Raman spectroscopy.

Title = {{Particulate and Aromatic Hydrocarbon Emissions from a Small-Scale
   Biomass Gasifier-Generator System}},

Abstract = {{Distributed gasification of biomass has potential as a renewable energy
   alternative, but the emissions from gasifier-generator systems raise
   potential environmental and human health concerns. Producer gas from
   gasifiers contains high concentrations of aromatic compounds, tars, and
   particulate matter. In gasifier-generator systems, producer gas is used
   to feed an internal combustion engine connected to a generator. Little
   is known about the extent to which spark-ignited engine combustion
   eliminates these harmful components. This study measured emissions at
   three locations of a 10 kW electric, fixed-bed, downdraft
   gasifier-generator system to determine the effectiveness of the
   packed-bed filter and the spark-ignited engine to reduce pollutant
   concentrations in the producer gas. Emissions were compared to regulated
   levels. Particulate matter concentrations were approximately 75 mg/Nm(3)
   in the pre-filtered producer gas and were reduced by about 99\% by the
   packed-bed filter to about 1 mg/Nm(3). Particulate matter concentrations
   were below regulated levels and did not change significantly because of
   the combustion in the engine for the conditions tested. Combustible
   compounds were 99\% consumed in the engine, and carbon monoxide
   concentrations in the engine exhaust were below regulated levels. While
   the concentrations of benzene and toluene in the engine exhaust were
   each approximately 10 ppm, it is expected that they would not exceed
   permissible exposure limits for ambient air if the system was installed
   in a properly ventilated area. Leak-free and properly maintained
   gasifier generator systems could be implemented in rural communities to
   efficiently use woody biomass without significant risk of human exposure
   to carbon monoxide, particulate matter, or light aromatic hydrocarbons.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the authors present a simple method to estimate intrinsic
   and extrinsic parameters of the camera for roundabout traffic scenes.
   Unlike many previous works on camera calibration for roadway scenes by
   using parallel lines, the proposed work addresses camera calibration for
   roundabout scenes by using a circle. The proposed method can estimate
   focal length, pan angle, tilt angle and camera height by matching the
   ellipse equation extracted from an image with the
   perspective-transformed equation of the corresponding real-world circle.
   This method requires only one image for camera calibration. The method
   is validated with real-world roundabout traffic scenes and the
   calibration results are reasonably accurate compared with ground truth
   measurements.}},

Title = {{Effect of Stress Singularity Magnitude on Scaling of Strength of
   Quasi-Brittle Structures}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Engineering structures are often designed to have complex geometries,
   which could introduce stress singularities that are weaker than the
   conventional -1/2 crack-tip singularity. Extrapolating the results of
   small-scale laboratory tests to predict the response of a full-scale
   structure comprised of quasi-brittle materials requires an understanding
   of how the weak stress singularities modify the classical energetic and
   statistical scaling theories of quasi-brittle fracture. Through a
   theoretical and numerical study, a new scaling law for quasi-brittle
   fracture is derived, which explicitly relates the nominal structural
   strength to the structure size and the magnitude of the stress
   singularity. The theoretical analysis is based on a generalized
   weakest-link model that combines the energetic scaling of fracture with
   the finite weakest-link model. The model captures the transition from
   the energetic scaling to statistical scaling as the strength of the
   stress singularity diminishes. The new scaling law is in close
   agreement, for the entire range of stress singularities, with the size
   effect curves predicted through finite-element simulations of concrete
   beams containing an arbitrary-angle V-notch under Mode-I fracture.}},

Abstract = {{Pathogen safety is crucial for plasma-derived clotting factor
   concentrates used in the treatment of bleeding disorders. Plasma, the
   starting material for these products, is collected by plasmapheresis
   (source plasma) or derived from whole blood donations (recovered
   plasma). The primary measures regarding pathogen safety are selection of
   healthy donors donating in centers with appropriate epidemiologic data
   for the main blood-transmissible viruses, screening donations for the
   absence of relevant infectious blood-borne viruses, and release of
   plasma pools for further processing only if they are nonreactive for
   serologic markers and nucleic acids for these viruses. Despite this
   testing, pathogen inactivation and/or removal during the manufacturing
   process of plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates is required to
   ensure prevention of transmission of infectious agents. Historically,
   hepatitis viruses and human immunodeficiency virus have posed the
   greatest threat to patients receiving plasma-derived therapy for
   treatment of hemophilia or von Willebrand disease. Over the past 30
   years, dedicated virus inactivation and removal steps have been
   integrated into factor concentrate production processes, essentially
   eliminating transmission of these viruses. Manufacturing steps used in
   the purification of factor concentrates have also proved to be
   successful in reducing potential prion infectivity. In this review,
   current techniques for inactivation and removal of pathogens from factor
   concentrates are discussed. Ideally, production processes should involve
   a combination of complementary steps for pathogen inactivation and/or
   removal to ensure product safety. Finally, potential batch-to-batch
   contamination is avoided by stringent cleaning and sanitization methods
   as part of the manufacturing process.}},

Abstract = {{A series of diblock glycopolycations were created by polymerizing
   2-deoxy-2-methacrylamido glucopyranose (MAG) with either a tertiary
   amine-containing monomer, N-{[}3-(N,N-dimethylamino) propyl]
   methacrylamide (DMAPMA), or a primary amine-containing unit,
   N-(2-aminoethyl) methacrylamide (AEMA). Seven structures were
   synthesized via aqueous reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer
   (RAFT) polymerization that varied in the block lengths of MAG, DMAPMA,
   and AEMA along with two homopolymer controls of DMAPMA and AEMA that
   lacked a MAG block. The polymers were all able to complex plasmid DNA
   into polyplex structures and to prevent colloidal aggregation of
   polyplexes in physiological salt conditions. In vitro transfection
   experiments were performed in both HeLa (human cervix adenocarcinoma)
   cells and HepG2 (human liver hepatocellular carcinoma) cells to examine
   the role of charge type, block length, and cell type on transfection
   efficiency and toxicity. The glycopolycation vehicles with primary amine
   blocks and PAEMA homopolymers revealed much higher transfection
   efficiency and lower toxicity compared to analogs created with DMAPMA.
   Block length was also shown to influence cellular delivery and toxicity;
   as the block length of DMAPMA increased in the glycopolycation-based
   polyplexes, toxicity increased while transfection decreased. While the
   charge block played a major role in delivery, the MAG block length did
   not affect these cellular parameters. Lastly, cell type played a major
   role in efficiency. These glycopolymers revealed higher cellular uptake
   and transfection efficiency in HepG2 cells than in HeLa cells, while
   homopolycations (PAEMA and PDMAPMA) lacking the MAG blocks exhibited the
   opposite trend, signifying that the MAG block could aid in hepatocyte
   transfection.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic Fe70Co30 nanoparticles with a cubic shape and a mean size of 15
   +/- 1.5 nm were fabricated using a magnetron-sputtering-based gas phase
   condensation deposition method. The particles had a high saturation
   magnetization of 220 emu/g, which is much higher than that of
   commercially available iron oxide nanoparticles. The FeCo nanoparticles
   were modified by 3-aminopropyltriethoxy silane and subsequently
   activated by glutaraldehyde, leading to successful attachment of
   aldehyde groups onto nanoparticle surfaces. Three proteins, namely
   streptavidin, PAPP-A antibody and Nectin-4 antibody, were immobilized on
   glutaraldehyde activated FeCo nanoparticles, and their loading levels
   were quantitatively evaluated. Our results show that loading
   capabilities are 95 mu g of streptavidin, 128 p.,g of PAPP-A, and 125 mu
   g of Nectin-4 antibody per milligram of FeCo nanoparticles, and that the
   three immobilized proteins retain their binding bioactivity. The
   protein-FeCo conjugates may find valuable applications involving
   magnetic separation and purification of proteins and cells, and the
   magnetic detection of biomolecules. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   Emergencies}},

Abstract = {{Current treatments for seizure emergencies, such as status epilepticus,
   include intravenous or rectal administration of benzodiazepines. While
   intranasal delivery of these drugs is desirable, the small volume of the
   nasal cavity and low drug solubility pose significant difficulties.
   Here, we prepared supersaturated diazepam solutions under physiological
   conditions and without precipitation, using a prodrug/enzyme system.
   Avizafone, a peptide prodrug of diazepam, was delivered with-Aspergillus
   oryzae (A.O.) protease, an enzyme identified from a pool of hydrolytic
   enzymes in assay buffer, pH 7.4 at 32A degrees C. This enzyme converted
   avizafone to diazepam at supersaturated concentrations. In vitro
   permeability studies were performed at various prodrug/enzyme ratios
   using Madin-Darby canine kidney II-wild type (MDCKII-wt) monolayers, a
   representative model of the nasal epithelium. Monolayer integrity was
   examined using TEER measurement and the lucifer yellow permeability
   assay. Prodrug/drug concentrations were measured using HPLC. Enzyme
   kinetics with avizafone-protease mixtures revealed K (M) = 1,501 A +/-
   232 mu M and V (max) = 1,369 A +/- 94 mu M/s. Prodrug-protease mixtures,
   when co-delivered apically onto MDCKII-wt monolayers, showed 2-17.6-fold
   greater diazepam flux (S = 1.3-15.3) compared to near-saturated diazepam
   (S = 0.7). Data for prodrug conversion upstream (apical side) and drug
   permeability downstream (basolateral side) fitted reasonably well to a
   previously developed in vitro two compartment pharmacokinetic model.
   Avizafone-protease mixtures resulted in supersaturated diazepam in less
   than 5 min, with the rate and extent of supersaturation determined by
   the prodrug/enzyme ratio. Together, these results suggest that an
   intranasal avizafone-protease system may provide a rapid and alternative
   means of diazepam delivery.}},

   An overview}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{28-43}},

Abstract = {{Research on using high-resolution event-based data for traffic modeling
   and control is still at early stage. In this paper, we provide a
   comprehensive overview on what has been achieved and also think ahead on
   what can be achieved in the future. It is our opinion that using
   high-resolution event data, instead of conventional aggregate data,
   could bring significant improvements to current research and practices
   in traffic engineering. Event data records the times when a vehicle
   arrives at and departs from a vehicle detector. From that, individual
   vehicle's on-detector-time and time gap between two consecutive vehicles
   can be derived. Such detailed information is of great importance for
   traffic modeling and control. As reviewed in this paper, current
   research has demonstrated that event data are extremely helpful in the
   fields of detector error diagnosis, vehicle classification, freeway
   travel time estimation, arterial performance measure, signal control
   optimization, traffic safety, traffic flow theory, and environmental
   studies. In addition, the cost of event data collection is low compared
   to other data collection techniques since event data can be directly
   collected from existing controller cabinet without any changes on the
   infrastructure, and can be continuously collected in 24/7 mode. This
   brings many research opportunities as suggested in the paper. (C) 2014

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{32}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{976-988}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by distributed storage applications, we investigate the degree
   to which capacity achieving codes can be efficiently updated when a
   single information symbol changes, and the degree to which such codes
   can be efficiently repaired when a single encoded symbol is lost.
   Specifically, we first develop conditions under which optimum
   error-correction and update-efficiency are possible. We establish that
   the number of encoded bits that should change in response to a change in
   a single information bit must scale logarithmically in the block-length
   of the code, if we are to achieve any nontrivial rate with vanishing
   probability of error over the binary erasure or binary symmetric
   channels. Moreover, we show that there exist capacity-achieving codes
   with this scaling.
   With respect to local repairability, we develop tight upper and lower
   bounds on the number of remaining encoded bits that are needed to
   recover a single lost encoded bit. In particular, we show that when the
   rate of an optimal code is epsilon below capacity, the maximum number of
   codeword symbols required to recover one lost symbol must scale as log
   1/epsilon.
   Several variations on-and extensions of-these results are also
   developed, including to the problem of rate-distortion coding.}},

Abstract = {{Many studies over the past two decades have shown that people can use
   brain signals to convey their intent to a computer using brain-computer
   interfaces (BCIs). BCI systems extract specific features of brain
   activity and translate them into control signals that drive an output.
   Recently, a category of BCIs that are built on the rhythmic activity
   recorded over the sensorimotor cortex, i.e., the sensorimotor rhythm
   (SMR), has attracted considerable attention among the BCIs that use
   noninvasive neural recordings, e. g., electroencephalography (EEG), and
   have demonstrated the capability of multidimensional prosthesis control.
   This paper reviews the current state and future perspectives of
   SMR-based BCI and its clinical applications, in particular focusing on
   the EEG SMR. The characteristic features of SMR from the human brain are
   described and their underlying neural sources are discussed. The
   functional components of SMR-based BCI, together with its current
   clinical applications, are reviewed. Finally, limitations of SMR-BCIs
   and future outlooks are also discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Path delays in IP networks are important metrics, required by network
   operators for assessment, planning, and fault diagnosis. Monitoring
   delays of all source-destination pairs in a large network are, however,
   challenging and wasteful of resources. This paper advocates a
   spatio-temporal Kalman filtering approach to construct network-wide
   delay maps using measurements on only a few paths. The proposed network
   cartography framework allows efficient tracking and prediction of delays
   by relying on both topological as well as historical data. Optimal paths
   for delay measurement are selected in an online fashion by leveraging
   the notion of submodularity. The resulting predictor is optimal in the
   class of linear predictors, and outperforms competing alternatives on
   real-world data sets.}},

   service point outage probability and outage cost models are presented to
   determine the economic value of standby energy capacity. Simulations are
   performed on a test C\&I system with local generation resources using

Abstract = {{Laboratory studies of virus aerosols have been criticized for generating
   airborne viruses from artificial nebulizer suspensions (e.g., cell
   culture media), which do not mimic the natural release of viruses (e.g.,
   from human saliva). The objectives of this study were to determine the
   effect of human saliva on the infectivity and survival of airborne virus
   and to compare it with those of artificial saliva and cell culture
   medium. A stock of MS2 bacteriophage was diluted in one of three
   nebulizer suspensions, aerosolized, size selected (100 to 450 nm) using
   a differential mobility analyzer, and collected onto gelatin filters.
   Uranine was used as a particle tracer. The resulting particle size
   distribution was measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. The
   amounts of infectious virus, total virus, and fluorescence in the
   collected samples were determined by infectivity assays, quantitative
   reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), and spectrofluorometry,
   respectively. For all nebulizer suspensions, the virus content generally
   followed a particle volume distribution rather than a number
   distribution. The survival of airborne MS2 was independent of particle
   size but was strongly affected by the type of nebulizer suspension.
   Human saliva was found to be much less protective than cell culture
   medium (i.e., 3\% tryptic soy broth) and artificial saliva. These
   results indicate the need for caution when extrapolating laboratory
   results, which often use artificial nebulizer suspensions. To better
   assess the risk of airborne transmission of viral diseases in real-life
   situations, the use of natural suspensions such as saliva or respiratory
   mucus is recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Strontium titanate (SrTiO3) is a foundational material in the emerging
   field of complex oxide electronics. Although its bulk electronic and
   optical properties are rich and have been studied for decades, SrTiO3
   has recently become a renewed focus of materials research catalysed in
   part by the discovery of superconductivity and magnetism at interfaces
   between SrTiO3 and other non-magnetic oxides. Here we illustrate a new
   aspect to the phenomenology of magnetism in SrTiO3 by reporting the
   observation of an optically induced and persistent magnetization in
   slightly oxygen-deficient bulk SrTiO3-delta crystals using magnetic
   circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry. This
   zero-field magnetization appears below similar to 18 K, persists for
   hours below 10 K, and is tunable by means of the polarization and
   wavelength of sub-bandgap (400-500 nm) light. These effects occur only
   in crystals containing oxygen vacancies, revealing a detailed interplay
   between magnetism, lattice defects, and light in an archetypal complex
   oxide material.}},

Abstract = {{A one-dimensional numerical model and simulation results are presented
   for a capacitively-coupled radio frequency parallel-plate argon-silane
   dusty plasma. The model includes self-consistently coupled numerical
   modules, including a plasma fluid model, a sectional aerosol model, and
   a simple chemistry model to predict rates of particle nucleation and
   surface growth. Operating conditions considered include 13.56 MHz
   frequency, 100 mTorr pressure, a 4-cm electrode gap, gas flow through
   the top electrode with a 30:1 ratio of argon to silane, and applied
   radio frequency voltage amplitude of either 100 or 250 V. In the higher
   voltage case two lobes of relatively large particles are formed by ion
   drag, while fresh nucleation occurs in the void between these lobes. It
   is shown that the reason that fresh nucleation occurs in the void
   involves an interplay among several coupled phenomena, including
   nanoparticle transport, the plasma potential profile, and trapping of
   silicon hydride anions that drive nucleation in this system.}},

   for controllable passive damping devices}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Designing control strategies for smart structures, such as those with
   semiactive devices, is complicated by the nonlinear nature of the
   feedback control, secondary clipping control and other additional
   requirements such as device saturation. The usual design approach
   resorts to large-scale simulation parameter studies that are
   computationally expensive. The authors have previously developed an
   approach for state-feedback semiactive clipped-optimal control design,
   based on a nonlinear Volterra integral equation that provides for the
   computationally efficient simulation of such systems. This paper expands
   the applicability of the approach by demonstrating that it can also be
   adapted to accommodate more realistic cases when, instead of full state
   feedback, only a limited set of noisy response measurements is available
   to the controller. This extension requires incorporating a Kalman filter
   (KF) estimator, which is linear, into the nominal model of the
   uncontrolled system. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated by a
   numerical study of a 100-degree-of-freedom frame model, excited by a
   filtered Gaussian random excitation, with noisy acceleration sensor
   measurements to determine the semiactive control commands. The results
   show that the proposed method can improve computational efficiency by
   more than two orders of magnitude relative to a conventional solver,
   while retaining a comparable level of accuracy. Further, the proposed
   approach is shown to be similarly efficient for an extensive Monte Carlo
   simulation to evaluate the effects of sensor noise levels and KF tuning
   on the accuracy of the response.}},

Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This research presents a method for convexifying the non-linear
   constraints and the objective function for the Transmission Network
   Expansion Planning Problem (TNEP). The TNEP seeks to identify the best
   set of transmission capacity additions to meet a future electric power
   demand. The TNEP is a non-convex Mixed Integer Non-linear Programming
   problem for which a variety of primal solution methods have been
   designed. In this paper, the TNEP is formulated as a bilinear
   programming problem subject to bilinear constraints. This allows
   resolving the non-linearities through convexification of the non-linear
   objective function and the constraints for a relaxation of the TNEP in
   which integrality requirements are removed. The final solution for the
   original TNEP problem is obtained by using a branch and bound strategy.
   It was found by using a two-node test case that the convexification
   method presented in this paper in conjunction with a brand and bound
   strategy identifies the optimal solution. Successfully solving a
   small-scale test problem through convexification presents a promising
   scenario to solve larger scale problems. This primal-dual method allows
   identifying the duality gap which is a limitation of primal methods.
   Further multidisciplinary research is needed to extend the method
   presented here to larger cases and real life networks. Copyright (c)

Abstract = {{This letter proposes an algorithm for linear whitening that minimizes
   the mean squared error between the original and whitened data without
   using the truncated eigendecomposition (ED) of the covariance matrix of
   the original data. This algorithm uses Lanczos vectors to accurately
   approximate the major eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance
   matrix of the original data. The major advantage of the proposed
   whitening approach is its low computational cost when compared with that
   of the truncated ED. This gain comes without sacrificing accuracy, as
   illustrated with an experiment of whitening a high-dimensional fMRI data

Title = {{Soft Switch Lock-Release Mechanism for a Switch-Mode Hydraulic Pump
   Circuit}},

Abstract = {{Switch-mode hydraulic circuits are a theoretically efficient, compact,
   fast responding, and inexpensive control option. Despite the many
   potential benefits of switch-mode hydraulic circuits, the control method
   suffers from large energy losses during transitions of the high-speed
   valve due to throttling and fluid compressibility. Rannow and Li
   previously proposed utilizing soft switching to minimize the throttling
   energy loss (Rannow and Li, ``Soft Switching Approach to Reducing
   Transition Losses in On/Off Hydraulic Valve,{''} J. Dyn. Syst., Measure.
   Control (in press)). A major challenge of this approach is a locking
   soft switch that releases quickly and with precise timing, while under
   load. In this paper, a novel soft switch locking mechanism is presented
   that utilizes the pressure signal in the switched volume to trigger the
   release. A dynamic model is developed of three unique soft switch
   circuits and two control circuits that create a virtually variable
   displacement pump. The model is used to perform a grid search
   optimization of the soft switch parameters for the three circuits. The
   three soft switch circuits reduce the throttling and compressibility
   energy losses between 49\% and 66\% compared with the control circuit.
   The simulation results demonstrated that the soft switch circuits
   perform as expected for duty cycles and pressures below the design
   conditions. At higher duty cycles and pressures, the short time the
   circuit is connected to tank prevented the soft switches from resetting
   between cycles, preventing proper function. This novel lock and release
   soft switch mechanism enables soft switching in switch-mode hydraulic
   circuits, which significantly reduces throttling and compressibility
   energy losses during valve transitions. Lower losses during valve
   transition allow the use of slower switching valves, lowering energy
   consumption, and cost.}},

Abstract = {{The increasing availability of precipitation observations from space,
   e.g., from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) and the
   forthcoming Global Precipitation Measuring (GPM) Mission, has fueled
   renewed interest in developing frameworks for downscaling and
   multi-sensor data fusion that can handle large data sets in
   computationally efficient ways while optimally reproducing desired
   properties of the underlying rainfall fields. Of special interest is the
   reproduction of extreme precipitation intensities and gradients, as
   these are directly relevant to hazard prediction. In this paper, we
   present a new formalism for downscaling satellite precipitation
   observations, which explicitly allows for the preservation of some key
   geometrical and statistical properties of spatial precipitation. These
   include sharp intensity gradients (due to high-intensity regions
   embedded within lower-intensity areas), coherent spatial structures (due
   to regions of slowly varying rainfall), and thicker-than-Gaussian tails
   of precipitation gradients and intensities. Specifically, we pose the
   downscaling problem as a discrete inverse problem and solve it via a
   regularized variational approach (variational downscaling) where the
   regularization term is selected to impose the desired smoothness in the
   solution while allowing for some steep gradients (called
   a{''}{''}(1)-norm or total variation regularization). We demonstrate the
   duality between this geometrically inspired solution and its Bayesian
   statistical interpretation, which is equivalent to assuming a Laplace
   prior distribution for the precipitation intensities in the derivative
   (wavelet) space. When the observation operator is not known, we discuss
   the effect of its misspecification and explore a previously proposed
   dictionary-based sparse inverse downscaling methodology to indirectly
   learn the observation operator from a data base of coincidental high-
   and low-resolution observations. The proposed method and ideas are
   illustrated in case studies featuring the downscaling of a hurricane
   precipitation field.}},

Abstract = {{A wireless vapor sensor based on the quantum capacitance effect in
   graphene is demonstrated. The sensor consists of a metal-oxide-graphene
   variable capacitor (varactor) coupled to an inductor, creating a

   proportion to water vapor concentration for relative humidity (RH)
   values ranging from 1\% to 97\% with a linear frequency shift of 5.7
   kHz/\% RH +/- 0.3 kHz/\% RH. The capacitance values extracted from the
   wireless measurements agree with those determined from
   capacitance-voltage measurements, providing strong evidence that the
   sensing arises from the variable quantum capacitance in graphene. These
   results represent a new sensor transduction mechanism and pave the way
   for graphene quantum capacitance sensors to be studied for a wide range

Abstract = {{Graph partitioning is a traditional problem with many applications and a
   number of high-quality algorithms have been developed. Recently, demand
   for social network analysis arouses the new research interest on graph
   partitioning/clustering. Social networks differ from conventional graphs
   in that they exhibit some key properties like power-law and small-world
   property. Currently, these features are largely neglected in popular
   partitioning algorithms. In this paper, we present a novel framework
   which leverages the small-world property for finding clusters in social
   networks. The framework consists of several key features. Firstly, we
   define a total order, which combines the edge weight, the small-world
   weight, and the hub value, to better reflect the connection strength
   between two vertices. Secondly, we design a strategy using this ordered
   list, to greedily, yet effectively, refine existing partitioning
   algorithms for common objective functions. Thirdly, the proposed method
   is independent of the original approach, such that it could be
   integrated with any types of existing graph clustering algorithms. We
   conduct an extensive performance study on both real-life and synthetic
   datasets. The empirical results clearly demonstrate that our framework
   significantly improves the output of the state-of-the-art methods.
   Furthermore, we show that the proposed method returns clusters with both
   internal and external higher qualities.}},

Abstract = {{High-efficiency DNA ligation is vital for many molecular biology
   experiments, and it is best achieved using reactants with
   non-palindromic sticky ends to maximize specificity. However, optimizing
   such multi-parametric ligation reactions often involves extensive trial
   and error. We have developed a freely available Web-based ligation
   calculator, NP-Sticky (http://sarkarlab.umn.edu/npsticky/), that
   predicts product distribution for given reactant concentrations, thus
   enabling straightforward computational optimization of these reactions.
   Built-in schemes include two-piece and three-piece linear ligation, as
   well as insert-vector circular ligation. The only parameters needed for
   the underlying thermodynamic model are the free energies of ligation for
   each sticky end, which can be estimated by the calculator from the
   overhang sequences or provided by the user from direct experimental
   measurement. Free energies of sticky-end mismatches are also calculated
   for determining the extent of byproduct formation. This ligation
   calculator allows rapid identification of the optimal conditions for
   maximizing incorporation, efficiency, and/or accuracy, based on specific
   needs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Brownian and Neel relaxation of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can be
   characterized by a highly sensitive mixing-frequency method using a
   search-coil based detection system. The unique magnetic properties of
   MNPs have been used for biomarkers detection. In this paper, we present
   a theory and implement an experimental detection scheme using the
   mixing-frequency method to identify different MNPs simultaneously. A
   low-frequency sinusoidal magnetic field is applied to saturate the MNPs
   periodically. A high-frequency sinusoidal magnetic field is then applied
   to generate mixing-frequency signals that are highly specific to the
   magnetization of MNPs. The spectra of each MNP can be defined as the
   complex magnetization of the MNPs over the field frequency. The magnetic
   spectra of various MNPs and magnetic beads have been characterized and
   compared. The differences between the MNPs spectra enable us to identify
   the individual MNPs at the same time. A test has been done to verify the
   ratio of two different MNPs in mixed samples based on the proposed
   theory. The experimental results show that the mixing-frequency method
   is a promising method for MNPs colourization.}},

Title = {{National Patterns in Environmental Injustice and Inequality: Outdoor NO2
   Air Pollution in the United States}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR 15}},
Abstract = {{We describe spatial patterns in environmental injustice and inequality
   for residential outdoor nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations in the
   contiguous United States. Our approach employs Census demographic data
   and a recently published high-resolution dataset of outdoor NO2
   concentrations. Nationally, population-weighted mean NO2 concentrations
   are 4.6 ppb (38\%, p<0.01) higher for nonwhites than for whites. The
   environmental health implications of that concentration disparity are
   compelling. For example, we estimate that reducing nonwhites' NO2
   concentrations to levels experienced by whites would reduce Ischemic
   Heart Disease (IHD) mortality by similar to 7,000 deaths per year, which
   is equivalent to 16 million people increasing their physical activity
   level from inactive (0 hours/week of physical activity) to sufficiently
   active (>2.5 hours/week of physical activity). Inequality for NO2
   concentration is greater than inequality for income (Atkinson Index:
   0.11 versus 0.08). Low-income nonwhite young children and elderly people
   are disproportionately exposed to residential outdoor NO2. Our findings
   establish a national context for previous work that has documented air
   pollution environmental injustice and inequality within individual US
   metropolitan areas and regions. Results given here can aid policy-makers
   in identifying locations with high environmental injustice and
   inequality. For example, states with both high injustice and high
   inequality (top quintile) for outdoor residential NO2 include New York,
   Michigan, and Wisconsin.}},

Abstract = {{We have demonstrated a novel sensing strategy employing a giant

   real-time signal readout of GMR biosensor and high selectivity of
   thymine-thymine (T-T) pair for Hg2+. The assay has a detection limit of
   10 nM in both buffer and natural water, which is the maximum mercury
   level in drinking water regulated by U.S. Environmental Protection
   Agency (EPA). The magnitude of the dynamic range for Hg2+ detection is
   up to three orders (10 nM to 10 mu M). Herein, GMR sensing technology is
   first introduced into a pollutant monitoring area. It can be foreseen
   that the GMR biosensor could become a robust contender in the areas of
   environmental monitoring and food safety testing.}},

Pages = {{2077-2085}},

Abstract = {{Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)-based nanocomposites with graphene or
   multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) were prepared by melt mixing. Aspect
   ratio, Af, and interparticle distance, A, of graphene in the
   nanocomposites were obtained from melt rheology and transmission
   electron microscopy respectively. A of PET/graphene nanocomposites was
   much smaller than A in PET/MWCNT. For PET/graphene with highest A(f), A
   became <1 mu m at more than 0.5 wt\% graphene. Non-isothermal
   crystallization behavior from the melt was investigated by differential
   scanning calorimety. The crystallization temperatures suggest that the
   nucleation effect of graphene was stronger than that of MWCNT. The half
   crystallization time of PET/graphene became longer than PET/MWCNT with
   increasing graphene loading, suggesting that confinement by graphene
   suppressed the crystal growth rate. XRD analysis indicated that smaller
   crystals formed in PET/graphene than in PET/MWCNT. From Raman
   spectroscopy, the pi-pi interaction between PET and graphene was
   stronger than that between PET and MWCNT. This stronger interaction in
   PET/graphene appears to result in formation of crystals with higher
   perfection. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights}},

Abstract = {{Receptor targeted, PEGylated transfection agents can improve stability
   and delivery specificity of current cationic lipid and polymer based
   nonviral gene delivery vehicles, but their mode of transfection is
   poorly understood. We therefore investigated the transfection mechanisms
   of 1,2-dioleoyl-3-trimethylammonium-propane
   (DOTAP)/1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipoplexes,
   branched polyethylenimine (bPEI) polyplexes, and bPEI encapsulated in
   either PEGylated (stealth) nontargeted liposomes or PR\_b peptide
   (targeted to alpha(5)beta(1), integrin) functionalized stealth liposomes
   in DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells in vitro with gene expression assays,
   flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. DOTAP/DOPE and PR\_b
   functionalized stealth liposomes mediated higher gene expression
   compared to nontargeted stealth liposomes and bPEI. However DOTAP/DOPE
   was internalized slowly leading to lower levels of DNA uptake. In
   contrast, despite high internalization of bPEI polyplexes, gene
   expression levels were low as DNA was unable to escape from the
   endosomes. Nontargeted stealth liposomes also mediated low gene
   expression due to low amounts of DNA internalized and slow
   internalization kinetics. PR\_b functionalized stealth liposomes struck
   an optimal balance among these transfection agents with efficient
   transfection arising from fast integrin mediated internalization
   kinetics, high amounts of DNA uptake, and endosomal escape. We found
   alpha(5)beta(1), integrin to be a valuable target for gene delivery and
   that the caveolar endocytic pathway may offer an advantage to receptor
   targeted PEGylated transfection agents in DLD-1 cells.}},

Abstract = {{Kerfing is a lumber-drying improvement technique that consists of cuts
   along both sides of boards, transversal to the longitudinal axis. The
   rationale behind this procedure is that, by cutting the fibers, the
   moisture loss through the end-grain is increased. The aim of this paper
   is to evaluate the effects of kerfing on drying time, warp occurrence,
   and bending properties, based on different experiments conducted during
   the last seven years. In most cases, kerfing reduced the drying time by
   half of that of the control samples. Results were inconclusive regarding
   reduction of warp. Regarding the bending strength of treated pieces,
   kerfing caused a minimum loss of moment of inertia in the piece,
   resulting in a slightly lower bending strength and higher stiffness.}},

Abstract = {{The original MOUDI (Micro-Orifice Uniform Deposit Impactor) cascade
   impactor, reported in the literature in 1991, used an external gear
   system to achieve a uniform deposit and was intended for industrial
   hygiene studies with sample times in the range of minutes to a few
   hours. To facilitate much longer run times, a second generation MOUDI,
   MOUDI-II, which uses internal electric motors to rotate the impaction
   plates, was developed. Three model 120 MOUDI-IIs were used in a 32-month
   program to sample ambient atmospheric aerosols at several industrial and
   urban locations in Minnesota. For these sampling locations, each 120
   MOUDI-II operated continuously for a minimum of five, and optimally
   7days, to collect a sample at a site. During these community sampling
   events, the three 120 MOUDI-IIs logged 4007, 2637, and 3230h of
   operating time, respectively. A laboratory side-by-side comparison of
   the three 120 MOUDI-IIs showed good agreement amongst the three 120
   MOUDI-IIs and, thus, the particle size distributions were independent of
   the 120 MOUDI-II used. Application of the 120 MOUDI-IIs for long-term
   ambient sampling was demonstrated by comparing size distributions from
   the background locations: Minneapolis, Duluth and Ely, Minnesota,
   representing urban, light industrial, and pristine area type of
   aerosols, respectively. PM2.5 averages from Minneapolis and Duluth
   compare well with three-year averages from state regulatory sampling.

Abstract = {{The early events in the retrovirus assembly pathway, particularly the
   timing and nature of Gag translocation from the site of protein
   translation to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, are poorly
   understood. We have investigated the interrelationship between
   cytoplasmic Gag concentration and plasma membrane association using
   complementary live-cell biophysical fluorescence techniques in real time
   with both human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) and human
   immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) Gag proteins. In particular,
   dual-color, z-scan fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy in conjunction
   with total internal reflection fluorescence and conventional,
   epi-illumination imaging were utilized. Our results demonstrate that
   HTLV-1 Gag is capable of membrane targeting and particle assembly at low
   (i.e., nanomolar) cytoplasmic concentrations and that there is a
   critical threshold concentration (approaching micromolar) prior to the
   observation of HIV-1 Gag associated with the plasma membrane. These
   observations imply fundamental differences between HIV-1 and HTLV-1 Gag
   trafficking and membrane association. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Biorefineries are facilities for the production of fuels and chemicals
   from biomass, which can tackle the increasing emissions of carbon
   dioxide. In this paper, we formulate a systematic biorefinery process
   synthesis problem with the goal of finding which of these products and
   process technologies result in a biorefinery with the highest economic
   potential or carbon efficiency. Our approach allows for the explicit
   evaluation and comparison of different biorefinery configurations. We
   also aim to investigate the relationship (and competition) between
   chemicals and fuels production. We initially develop a biorefinery
   superstructure and formulate a mixed integer nonlinear program which we
   solve for the optimal biorefinery configuration. We present sensitivity
   analyses with respect to changes in product prices and feedstock costs
   which allows us to better understand how the optimal configuration
   responds to changing economic conditions. We present a Monte Carlo type
   sampling of these parameters which indicates which technologies and
   products will most likely lead to profitable biorefinery configurations.
   We also investigate the robustness of a fixed biorefinery configuration.
   Finally, we perform a multiobjective optimization investigating the
   trade-offs between net present value and carbon efficiency. Our work
   suggests that the biorefinery concept is most likely to be profitable
   and flexible if the production of fuels and chemicals are combined in
   one facility.}},

Abstract = {{Using high-speed photography, we investigate two distinct regimes of the
   impact dynamics of granular jets with noncircular cross sections. In the
   steady-state regime, we observe the formation of thin granular sheets
   with anisotropic shapes and show that the degree of anisotropy increases
   with the aspect ratio of the jet's cross section. Our results illustrate
   the liquidlike behavior of granular materials during impact and
   demonstrate that a collective hydrodynamic flow emerges from strongly
   interacting discrete particles. We discuss the analogy between our

   similar anisotropic ejecta from a quark-gluon plasma have been observed
   in heavy-ion impact.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Transgenic mice carrying site-specific genome modifications (knockout,
   knock-in) are of vital importance for dissecting complex biological
   systems as well as for modeling human diseases and testing therapeutic
   strategies. Recent advances in the use of designer nucleases such as
   zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector
   nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short
   palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) 9 system for
   site-specific genome engineering open the possibility to perform rapid
   targeted genome modification in virtually any laboratory species without
   the need to rely on embryonic stem (ES) cell technology. A genome
   editing experiment typically starts with identification of designer
   nuclease target sites within a gene of interest followed by construction
   of custom DNA-binding domains to direct nuclease activity to the
   investigator-defined genomic locus. Designer nuclease plasmids are in
   vitro transcribed to generate mRNA for microinjection of fertilized
   mouse oocytes. Here, we provide a protocol for achieving targeted genome
   modification by direct injection of TALEN mRNA into fertilized mouse

   plasmas: a review}},
Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The gas temperature in non-equilibrium plasmas is often obtained from
   the plasma-induced emission by measuring the rotational temperature of a
   diatomic molecule in its excited state. This is motivated by both
   tradition and the availability of low budget spectrometers. However,
   non-thermal plasmas do not automatically guarantee that the rotational
   distribution in the monitored vibrational level of the diatomic molecule
   is in equilibrium with the translational (gas) temperature. Often
   non-Boltzmann rotational molecular spectra are found in non-equilibrium
   plasmas. The deduction of a gas temperature from these non-thermal
   distributions must be done with care as clearly the equilibrium between
   translational and rotational degrees of freedom cannot be achieved. In
   this contribution different methods and approaches to determine the gas
   temperature are evaluated and discussed. A detailed analysis of the gas
   temperature determination from rotational spectra is performed. The
   physical and chemical background of non-equilibrium rotational
   population distributions in molecular spectra is discussed and a large
   range of conditions for which non-equilibrium occurs are identified.
   Fitting procedures which are used to fit (non-equilibrium) rotational
   distributions are analyzed in detail. Lastly, recommendations concerning
   the conditions for which the gas temperatures can be obtained from
   diatomic spectra are formulated.}},

Abstract = {{The spatial profile of the absolute atomic oxygen density is obtained by
   two-photon absorption laser-induced fluorescence (TALIF) in an Ar+2\%
   air cold atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ) operating in ambient
   air. The varying air concentration in the jet effluent which contributes
   to the collisional quenching of the O 3p P-3(J) state, pumped by the
   laser, strongly influences the recorded TALIF signal under the present
   experimental conditions. The spatially resolved air densities obtained
   from Raman scattering measurements have been reported in our previous
   work (van Gessel et al 2013 Appl. Phys. Lett. 103 064103). These
   densities allow us to calculate the spatially dependent collisional
   quenching rate for the O 3p P-3(J) state and reconstruct the spatial O
   density profile from the recorded TALIF signal. Significant differences
   between the TALIF intensity profile and the actual O density profile for
   the investigated experimental conditions are found.}},

Abstract = {{Local adaptation and adaptive clines are pervasive in natural plant
   populations, yet the effects of these types of adaptation on genomic
   diversity are not well understood. With a data set of 202 accessions of
   Medicago truncatula genotyped at almost 2 million single nucleotide
   polymorphisms, we used mixed linear models to identify candidate loci
   responsible for adaptation to three climatic gradients-annual mean
   temperature (AMT), precipitation in the wettest month (PWM), and
   isothermality (ITH)-representing the major axes of climate variation
   across the species' range. Loci with the strongest association to these
   climate gradients tagged genome regions with high sequence similarity to
   genes with functional roles in thermal tolerance, drought tolerance, or
   resistance to herbivores of pathogens. Genotypes at these candidate loci
   also predicted the performance of an independent sample of plant
   accessions grown in climate-controlled conditions. Compared to a
   genome-wide sample of randomly drawn reference SNPs, candidates for two
   climate gradients, AMT and PWM, were significantly enriched for genic
   regions, and genome segments flanking genic AMT and PWM candidates
   harbored less nucleotide diversity, elevated differentiation between
   haplotypes carrying alternate alleles, and an overrepresentation of the
   most common haplotypes. These patterns of diversity are consistent with
   a history of soft selective sweeps acting on loci underlying adaptation
   to climate, but not with a history of long-term balancing selection.}},

Abstract = {{Most thermoluminescent materials are created using crystal growth
   techniques; however, it would be of great utility to identify those few
   thermoluminescent materials that can be deposited using simpler methods,
   for example to be compatible with the early portions of a silicon
   integrated circuit or microelectromechanical fabrication process. In
   this work, thin films of yttrium oxide with a terbium impurity (Y2O3:Tb)
   were deposited on silicon wafers by electron beam evaporation. The
   source for the Y2O3:Tb was made by combining Y2O3 and Tb4O7 powders. The
   approximate thicknesses of the deposited films were 350 nm. After
   deposition, the films were annealed at 1100 degrees C for 30 s to
   improve crystallinity. There is a strong correlation between the x-ray
   diffraction (XRD) peak intensity and the thermoluminescent glow curve
   intensity. The glow curve displays at least two peaks at 140 degrees C
   and 230 degrees C. The emission spectra was measured using successive
   runs with a monochromator set to a different wavelength for each run.
   There are two main emission peaks at 490 nm and 540 nm. The terbium
   impurity concentration of approximately 1 mol\% was measured using
   Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The Y2O3:Tb is sensitive
   to UV, x-ray, and gamma radiation. The luminescent intensity per unit
   mass of UV irradiated Y2O3:Tb was about 2 times that of x-ray irradiated
   TLD-100. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the adsorption and desorption properties of Co(II) on
   D113:III resin have been studied. The different variables: affecting the
   adsorption capacity Such as pH of the solution; temperature and
   contact-time have been investigated, which indicate that D113-III resit
   could adsorb Co(l) effectively from aqueous solution. The results show
   that the optimal adsorption condition of D113-III resin for CO(II) is
   achieved at pH = 6.5. The maximum saturated adsorption Capacity of
   CO(II) is 192.1 mg.g(-1) D113-III resin rat 298 K. The thermodynamic
   parameters such as Delta G degrees which were all negative and Delta H
   degrees Which was positive, indicated that the adsorption of Co(II) ion
   onto D113-III resin was spontaneous and endothermic, respectively.
   Positive Delta S degrees value of Co(II) adsorption process indicates an
   irregular increase of the randomness at the D113-III resin-solution
   interface during adsorption. Adsorption isotherms correlated well with
   the Langmuir model. Experimental data were also evaluated to find out
   kinetic characteristics Of the adsorption process. Desorption: studies
   revealed that Co(II) ion could be eluted effectively by using the
   0.25-1.0 mol L-1 HCl solution. Thomas Model was applied to experimental
   data to predict the breakthrough curves and to determine the
   characteristics parameters of the column Useful for process design.}},

Journal = {{PARTICUOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{1-26}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Concern over the health effects of fine particles in the ambient
   environment led the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to develop the
   first standard for PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 mu m) in
   1997. The Particle Technology Laboratory at the University of Minnesota
   has helped to establish the PM2.5 standard by developing many
   instruments and samplers to perform atmospheric measurements. In this
   paper, we review various aspects of PM2.5, including its measurement,
   source apportionment, visibility and health effects, and mitigation. We
   focus on PM2.5 studies in China and where appropriate, compare them with
   those obtained in the U.S. Based on accurate PM2.5 sampling, chemical
   analysis, and source apportionment models, the major PM2.5 sources in
   China have been identified to be coal combustion, motor vehicle
   emissions, and industrial sources. Atmospheric visibility has been found
   to correlate well with PM2.5 concentration. Sulfate, ammonium, and
   nitrate carried by PM2.5, commonly found in coal burning and vehicle
   emissions, are the dominant contributors to regional haze in China.
   Short-term exposure to PM2.5 is strongly associated with the increased
   risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular and respiratory
   diseases in China. The strategy for PM2.5 mitigation must be based on
   reducing the pollutants from the two primary sources of coal-fired power
   plants and vehicle emissions. Although conventional Particulate Emission
   Control Devices (PECD) such as electrostatic precipitators in Chinese
   coal-fired power plants are generally effective for large particles,
   most of them may not have high collection efficiency of PM2.5. Baghouse
   filtration is gradually incorporated into the PECD to increase the PM2.5
   collection efficiency. By adopting stringent vehicle emissions standard
   such as Euro 5 and 6, the emissions from vehicles can be gradually
   reduced over the years. An integrative approach, from collaboration
   among academia, government, and industries, can effectively manage and
   mitigate the PM2.5 pollution in China. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier

Title = {{Turbulent flow in rib-roughened channel under the effect of Coriolis and
   rotational buoyancy forces}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The turbulent flow inside a rotating channel provided with transverse
   ribs along one wall is studied by means of two-dimensional time-resolved
   particle image velocimetry. The measurement set-up is mounted on the
   same rotating disk with the test section, allowing to obtain the same
   accuracy and resolution as in a non-rotating rig. The Reynolds number is
   15 000, and the rotation number is 0.38. As the ribbed wall is heated,
   both the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force play a role in the
   fluid dynamics. The mean velocity fields highlight the major impact of
   the rotational buoyancy (characterized by a buoyancy number of 0.31) on
   the flow along the leading side of the duct. In particular, since the
   flow is directed radially outward, the near-wall layers experience
   significant centripetal buoyancy. The recirculation area behind the
   obstacles is enlarged to the point of spanning the whole inter-rib
   space. Also the turbulent fluctuations are significantly altered, and
   overall augmented, with respect to the non-buoyant case, resulting in
   higher turbulence levels far from the rib. On the other hand the
   centrifugal force has little or no impact on the flow along the trailing
   wall. Vortex identification, proper orthogonal decomposition, and
   two-point correlations are used to highlight rotational effects, and in
   particular to determine the dominant scales of the turbulent unsteady
   flow, the time-dependent behavior of the shear layer and of the

Title = {{Thin-liquid-film flow on a topographically patterned rotating cylinder}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{The flow of thin liquid films on rotating surfaces is directly relevant
   to the coating of discrete objects. To begin understanding how surface
   topography influences such flows, we consider a model problem in which a
   thin liquid film flows over a rotating cylinder patterned with a
   sinusoidal surface topography. Lubrication theory is applied to develop
   a partial differential equation that governs the film thickness as a
   function of time and the angular coordinate. Static situations are
   considered first in order to determine the parameter regime in which the
   lubrication approximation is expected to be valid. When gravitational
   forces are relatively weak, cylinder rotation leads to the formation of
   droplets connected by very thin films. The number of droplets is equal
   to the pattern frequency at low and high rotation rates, with the
   droplets located at the pattern troughs at low rotation rates and the
   pattern crests at high rotation rates. When gravitational forces become
   significant, the film thickness never reaches a steady state, in
   contrast to the case of an unpatterned cylinder. The results of this
   work clearly establish that the flow of thin liquid films on rotating
   surfaces can be very sensitive to the presence of surface topography.

Abstract = {{Rare earth metal borides have attracted great interest due to their
   unusual properties, such as superconductivity and f-electron magnetism.
   A recent discovery attributes the tunability of magnetism in rare earth
   aluminoborides to the effect of so-called ``building defects.{''} In
   this paper, we report data for the effect of building defects on the
   thermal conductivities of alpha-TmAlB4 single crystals. Building defects
   reduce the thermal conductivity of alpha-TmAlB4 by approximate to 30\%.
   At room temperature, the thermal conductivity of AlB2 is nearly a factor
   of 5 higher than that of alpha-TmAlB4. AlB2 single crystals are
   thermally anisotropic with the c-axis thermal conductivity nearly twice
   the thermal conductivity of the a-b plane. Temperature dependence of the
   thermal conductivity near and above room temperature reveals that both
   electrons and phonons contribute substantially to thermal transport in
   AlB2 with electrons being the dominant heat carriers. (C) 2014

Title = {{Robust stabilizer design for linear time-varying internal model based
   output regulation and its application to an electrohydraulic system}},

Volume = {{50}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the design of a low order robust stabilizer for
   the tracking/disturbance rejection problem based on the internal model
   principle in the time-varying setting and its application to the
   hydraulic pressure tracking with varying frequency. The problem of this
   kind known as output regulation generally consists of two major parts:
   internal model unit construction and stabilizer design. While the
   construction of the time-varying internal model unit is non-trivial by
   itself and a very recent research outcome enables its synthesis for a
   class of linear time-varying systems, the effective stabilization of the
   augmented system (internal model unit and plant) for practical
   applications remains a challenge. This is due to the need to stabilize
   the high order time-varying augmented system using a low order
   stabilizer in a robust fashion and with desirable transient performance.
   While directly applying the stabilization approaches for a general LTV
   system will result in a high order stabilizer, a new method is proposed
   in this paper that overcomes this bottleneck by taking advantage of the
   unique structure of the internal model based control system. Instead of
   using a dynamic stabilizer with high order, this approach uses a
   sequence of time-varying gains that are directly injected into the
   internal model unit. A critical issue addressed is how to avoid the
   non-convex optimization associated with the time-varying gain synthesis
   and then convert the stabilizer design into a series of Linear Matrix
   Inequalities (LMIs). The proposed control approach is then demonstrated
   on an electrohydraulic system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{A life cycle assessment (LCA) study was conducted to understand and
   assess potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction benefits of a
   biomass torrefaction business integrated with other industrial
   businesses for the use of the excess heat from the tonefaction off-gas
   volatiles and biocoal. A torrefaction plant processing 30.3 Mg h (1) of
   corn stover at 17\% wet basis (w.b.) moisture content was modeled. The
   torrefaction plant produced 136,078 Mg y (1) of biocoal at 1.1\% w.b.
   moisture content and 28.1 MW of excess heat energy in the torrefaction
   off-gas volatiles. At the torrefaction plant gate, the life-cycle GHG
   emission for the production of biocoal (including corn stover logistics
   emissions) is 11.35 g MJ (1) carbon dioxide equivalent (dry basis)
   (i.e., 229.5 kg Mg (1) carbon dioxide equivalent of biocoal at 1.1\%
   w.b. moisture content). The excess heat from the torrefaction plant met
   42.8\% of the process steam needs of a U.S. Midwest dry-grind corn
   ethanol plant producing 0.38 hm(3) y (1) of denatured ethanol, which
   results in about 40\% reduction in lifecycle GHG emissions for corn
   ethanol compared to gasoline. Co-firing 10\%, 20\%, and 30\% (energy
   basis) of biocoal at a coal-fired power plant reduced the life-cycle GHG
   emissions of electricity generated by 8.5\%, 17.0\%, and 25.6\%,
   respectively, compared to 100\% coal-fired electricity. A sensitivity
   analysis showed that adding a combined heat and power (CHP) system at
   the torrefaction plant to meet 100\% electricity demand of the
   torrefaction plant (2.5 MW) could further reduce the GHG emissions for
   biocoal, corn ethanol, and co-fired electricity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

   fashion. Surface plasmon resonance is now finding applications in the
   characterization of molecules for treatment of neurodegenerative
   diseases, characterization of molecules associated with pathogenesis of
   neurodegenerative diseases and detection of neurodegenerative disease
   biomarkers. In addition it has been used in the characterization of a
   new class of natural autoantibodies that have therapeutic potential in a
   number of neurologic diseases. In this review we will introduce surface

Abstract = {{Microbial oil accumulation via oleaginous fungi has some potential
   benefits because filamentous fungi can form pellets during cell growth
   and these pellets are easier to harvest from the culture broth than
   individual cells. This research studied the effect of various culture
   conditions on the pelletized cell growth of Mucor circinelloides and its
   lipid accumulation. The results showed that cell pelletization was
   positively correlated to biomass accumulation; however, pellet size was
   negatively correlated to the oil content of the fungal biomass, possibly
   due to the mass transfer barriers generated by the pellet structure. How
   to control the size of the pellet is the key to the success of the
   pelletized microbial oil accumulation process.}},

Abstract = {{An isothermal thermochemical cycle to split CO2 based on
   nonstoichiometric reduction and oxidation of ceria is demonstrated.
   Carbon monoxide is produced via an oxygen partial pressure swing by
   alternating inert sweep gas and CO2 flows over the ceria. The rates of
   reduction and oxidation at 1500 degrees C in a porous ceria particle bed
   are measured for sweep gas and CO2 flow rates from 50 to 600 mL min(-1)
   g(-1) and analyzed to identify cycle operating conditions (gas flow
   rates and reduction and oxidation durations) that maximize process
   efficiency. For a solar reactor assumed to operate at 3000 suns
   concentration and with 90\% of the sensible heat of the gases recovered,
   the optimal cycle uses 150 mL g(-1) sweep gas and 50 mL min(-1) g(-1)
   CO2 at reduction and oxidation periods of 100 and 155 s, respectively.
   This cycle is demonstrated in an IR imaging furnace over 102 cycles,
   yielding a stable average rate of CO production of 0.079 mu mol s(-1)
   g(-1) and a projected reactor efficiency of 4\%. The optimal conditions
   apply at large scale if the flow rates are scaled in proportion to the
   ceria mass.}},

Abstract = {{Polar codes have emerged as important error correction codes due to
   their capacity-achieving property. Successive cancellation (SC)
   algorithm is viewed as a good candidate for hardware design of polar
   decoders due to its low complexity. However, for polar codes, the long
   latency of SC algorithm of is a bottleneck for designing high-throughput
   polar decoder. In this paper, we present a novel reformulation for the
   last stage of SC decoding. The proposed reformulation leads to two
   benefits. First, critical path and hardware complexity in the last stage
   of SC algorithm is significantly reduced. Second, 2 bits can be decoded
   simultaneously instead of 1 bit. As a result, this new decoder, referred
   to as 2b-SC decoder, reduces latency from (2n - 2) to (1.5n - 2) without
   performance loss. Additionally, overlapped-scheduling, precomputation
   and look-ahead techniques are used to design two additional decoders
   referred to as 2b-SC-Overlapped-scheduling decoder and
   2b-SC-Precomputation decoder, respectively. All three architectures
   offer significant advantages with respect to throughput and hardware
   efficiency. Compared to known prior least-latency SC decoder, the
   2b-SC-Precomputation decoder has 25\% less latency. Synthesis results
   show that the proposed (1024, 512) 2b-SC-Precomputation decoder can
   achieve at least 4 times increase in throughput and 40\% increase in
   hardware efficiency.}},

   periodic gold nanohole array enables real-time label-free detection of
   analyte molecules in a 5 mu L, droplet using concentrations as low as 1
   pM within a few minutes, which is more than 1000 times faster than
   purely diffusion-based binding. The nanohole-based optofluidic platform
   demonstrated here is straightforward to construct, applicable to both
   charged and neutral molecules, and performs a novel function that cannot
   be accomplished using conventional surface plasmon resonance sensors.}},

Abstract = {{We have combined a versatile and powerful route to deliver nucleic acids
   with peptide-based cell-specific targeting. siRNA targeting the
   polo-like kinase gene is in clinical trials for cancer treatment, and
   here we deliver this RNA selectively to cancer cells displaying the
   neuropilin-1 epitope using gold nanoshells. Release of the siRNA from
   the nanoparticles results from irradiation with a pulsed near-infrared
   laser, which also provides efficient endosomal escape within the cell.
   As a result, our approach requires 10-fold less material than standard
   nucleic acid transduction materials and is significantly more efficient
   than other particle-based methods. We also describe a particle nucleic
   acid design that does not rely on modified RNA, thereby making the
   preparation of these materials more efficient and much less expensive.
   These improvements, when combined with control over when and where the
   siRNA is released, could provide the basis for diverse cell biological
   studies.}},

Abstract = {{Cell therapies have emerged as a promising treatment for the prevention
   of heart failure after myocardial infarction (MI). This study evaluated
   the capacity of an aligned, fibrin-based, stretch-conditioned cardiac
   patch consisting of either the native population or a cardiomyocyte
   (CM)-depleted population (i.e., CM+ or CM- patches) of neonatal rat
   heart cells to ameliorate left ventricular (LV) remodeling in the
   acute-phase postinfarction in syngeneic, immunocompetent rats. Patches
   were exposed to 7 days of static culture and 7 days of cyclic stretching
   prior to implantation. Within 1 week of implantation, both patches
   became vascularized, and non-CMs began migrating from CM+ patches. By
   week 4, patches had been remodeled into collagenous tissue, and live,
   elongated, donor CMs were found within grafted CM+ patches. Significant
   improvement in cardiac contractile function was seen with the
   administration of the CM+ patch (ejection fraction increased from
   35.1\%+/- 4.0\% for MI only to 58.8\%+/- 7.3\% with a CM+ patch, p<0.05)
   associated with a 77\% reduction in infarct size (61.3\%+/- 7.9\% for MI
   only, 13.9\%+/- 10.8\% for CM+ patch, p<0.05), and the elimination of LV
   free-wall thinning. Decreased infarct size and reduced wall thinning
   also occurred with the administration of the CM- patch (infarct size
   36.9\%+/- 10.2\%, LV wall thickness: 1058.2 +/- 135.4 mu m for CM-
   patch, 661.3 +/- 37.4 mu m for MI only, p<0.05), but without
   improvements in cardiac function. Approximately 36.5\% of the
   transplanted CMs survived at 4 weeks; however, they remained separated
   and electrically uncoupled from the host myocardium by a layer of
   CM-free tissue, which suggests that the benefits of CM+ patch
   transplantation resulted from paracrine mechanisms originating from CMs.
   Collectively, these observations suggest that the transplantation of
   CM-containing engineered heart tissue patches can lead to dramatic
   improvements in cardiac function and remodeling after acute MI.}},

Abstract = {{Vegetable oils are one of the most important classes of bio-resources
   for producing polymeric materials. The main components of vegetable oils
   are triglycerides - esters of glycerol with three fatty acids. Several
   highly reactive sites including double bonds, allylic positions and the
   ester groups are present in triglycerides from which a great variety of
   polymers with different structures and functionalities can be prepared.
   Vegetable-oil-based polyurethane, polyester, polyether and polyolefin
   are the four most important classes of polymers, many of which have
   excellent biocompatibilities and unique properties including shape
   memory. In view of these characteristics, vegetable-oil-based polymers
   play an important role in biomaterials and have attracted increasing
   attention from the polymer community. Here we comprehensively review
   recent developments in the preparation of vegetable-oil-based
   polyurethane, polyester, polyether and polyolefin, all of which have
   potential applications as biomaterials. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{An adaptive PLL that maximizes the timing compensation between clock and
   data, commonly referred to as the clock data compensation effect, is
   demonstrated in 32 nm SOI. A number of previous adaptive PLL designs
   have successfully proven that processor operating speed can be improved
   by modulating the clock path delay or the PLL output clock period using
   the resonant supply noise. In this work, we take the adaptive PLL
   concept one step further by achieving optimal clock data compensation
   across a wide range of PVT and operating conditions. This was
   accomplished by an automated supply-noise sensitivity tracking loop
   which constantly monitors any timing errors occurring in a critical path
   replica circuit. Compared to a conventional PLL, the proposed design
   achieves up to a 15.6\% improvement in processor Fmax or a 9.8\% reduced
   dynamic power consumption under an iso-operating frequency for a
   realistic supply noise. Additionally, a 92.1\% reduction in PLL area was
   achieved by employing ultra-high density deep trench capacitors in the
   loop filter.}},

Abstract = {{Existing environmental policies aim to reduce emissions but lack
   standards for addressing environmental justice. Environmental justice
   research documents disparities in exposure to air pollution; however,
   little guidance currently exists on how to make improvements or on how
   specific emission-reduction scenarios would improve or deteriorate
   environmental justice conditions. Here, we quantify how emission
   reductions from specific sources would change various measures of
   environmental equality and justice. We evaluate potential emission
   reductions for fine diesel particulate matter (DPM) in Southern
   California for five sources: on-road mobile, off-road mobile, ships,
   trains, and stationary. Our approach employs state-of-the-science
   dispersion and exposure models. We compare four environmental goals:
   impact, efficiency, equality, and justice. Results indicate potential
   trade-offs among those goals. For example, reductions in train emissions
   produce the greatest improvements in terms of efficiency, equality, and
   justice, whereas off-road mobile source reductions can have the greatest
   total impact. Reductions in on-road emissions produce improvements in
   impact, equality, and justice, whereas emission reductions from ships
   would widen existing population inequalities. Results are similar for
   complex versus simplified exposure analyses. The approach employed here
   could usefully be applied elsewhere to evaluate opportunities for
   improving environmental equality and justice in other locations.}},

Abstract = {{Low-voltage distribution feeders were designed to sustain unidirectional
   power flows to residential neighborhoods. The increased penetration of
   roof-top photovoltaic (PV) systems has highlighted pressing needs to
   address power quality and reliability concerns, especially when PV
   generation exceeds the household demand. A systematic method for
   determining the active-and reactive-power set points for PV inverters in
   residential systems is proposed in this paper, with the objective of
   optimizing the operation of the distribution feeder and ensuring voltage
   regulation. Binary PV-inverter selection variables and nonlinear
   power-flow relations render the optimal inverter dispatch problem
   nonconvex and NP-hard. Nevertheless, sparsity-promoting regularization
   approaches and semidefinite relaxation techniques are leveraged to
   obtain a computationally feasible convex reformulation. The merits of
   the proposed approach are demonstrated using real-world PV-generation
   and load-profile data for an illustrative low-voltage residential
   distribution system.}},

Volume = {{744}},

Abstract = {{The effect of the rapid distortion of a surface wave on the kinetic
   energy of turbulence underneath is studied based on the simulation data
   of Part 1 (Guo \& Shen, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 733, 2013, pp. 558-587). In
   the Eulerian frame, Reynolds normal stresses, which contribute to
   turbulence kinetic energy, are found to vary with the wave phase. An
   analysis of their budgets shows that their variation is dominated not
   only by the normal production term representing the wave straining
   effect on wave-turbulence energy exchange, but also by pressure effects
   including the pressure-strain correlation and pressure transport terms.
   In the Lagrangian frame, the net energy transfer from the wave to
   turbulence is analysed. It is found to be mainly contributed by the mean
   Lagrangian effect and the correlation between the Lagrangian
   fluctuations of the wave and turbulence; the former plays a major role
   in the overall wave energy dissipation, while the latter is associated
   with the viscous effect of the wave surface and is appreciable in the
   near-surface region. Models for various terms in wave-turbulence energy
   flux are discussed. The decay time scale of swells in oceans estimated
   from our simulations compares well with the results in the literature.}},

Title = {{On the onset of wake meandering for an axial flow turbine in a turbulent
   open channel flow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{744}},
Pages = {{376-403}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Laboratory experiments have yielded evidence suggestive of large-scale
   meandering motions in the wake of an axial flow hydrokinetic turbine in
   a turbulent open channel flow (Chamorro et al., J. Fluid Mech., vol.
   716, 2013, pp. 658-670). We carry out a large-eddy simulation (LES) of
   the experimental flow to investigate the structure of turbulence in the
   wake of the turbine and elucidate the mechanism that gives rise to wake
   meandering. All geometrical details of the turbine structure are taken
   into account in the simulation using the curvilinear immersed boundary
   LES method with wall modelling (Kang et al., Adv. Water Resour., vol.
   34(1), 2011, pp. 98-113). The simulated flow fields are in good
   agreement with the experimental measurements and confirm the theoretical
   model of turbine wakes (Joukowski, Tr. Otdel. Fizich. Nauk Obshch. Lyub.
   Estestv., vol. 16, 1912, no. 1), yielding a near-turbine wake that
   consists of two layers: the tip vortex (or outer) shear layer that
   rotates in the same direction as the rotor; and the inner layer
   counter-rotating hub vortex. Analysis of the calculated instantaneous
   flow fields reveals that the hub vortex undergoes spiral vortex
   breakdown and precesses slowly in the direction opposite to the turbine
   rotation. The precessing vortex core remains coherent for three to four
   rotor diameters, expands radially outwards, and intercepts the outer
   shear layer at approximately the location where wake meandering is
   initiated. The wake meandering manifests itself in terms of an elongated
   region of increased turbulence kinetic energy and Reynolds shear stress
   across the top tip wake boundary. The interaction of the outer region of
   the flow with the precessing hub vortex also causes the rotational
   component of the wake to decay completely at approximately the location
   where the wake begins to meander (four rotor diameters downstream of the
   turbine). To further investigate the importance of turbine geometry on
   far-wake dynamics, we carry out LES under the same flow conditions but
   using actuator disk and actuator line parametrizations of the turbine.
   While both actuator approaches yield a meandering wake, the actuator
   line model yields results that are in better overall agreement with the
   measurements. However, comparisons between the actuator line and the
   turbine-resolving LES reveal significant differences. Namely, in the
   actuator line LES model: (i) the hub vortex does not develop spiral
   instability and remains stable and columnar without ever intercepting
   the outer shear layer; (ii) wake rotation persists for much longer
   distance downstream than in the turbine-resolving LES; and (iii) the
   level of turbulence kinetic energy within and the overall size of the
   far-wake meandering region are considerably smaller (this discrepancy is
   even more pronounced for the actuator disk LES case) compared with the
   turbine-resolving LES. Our results identify for the first time the
   instability mechanism that amplified wake meandering in the experiment
   of Chamorro et al., show that computational models that do not take into
   account the geometrical details of the turbine cannot capture such
   phenomena, and point to the potential significance of the near-hub rotor
   design as a means for suppressing the instability of the hub vortex and
   diminishing the extent and intensity of the far-wake meandering region.}},

   leads into the brain parenchyma. In this study, we used computational
   modeling to investigate the feasibility of using an endovascular
   approach to target DBS therapy. Approach. Image-based anatomical
   reconstructions of the human brain and vasculature were used to identify
   17 established and hypothesized anatomical targets of DBS, of which five
   were found adjacent to a vein or artery with intraluminal diameter >= 1
   mm. Two of these targets, the fornix and subgenual cingulate white
   matter (SgCwm) tracts, were further investigated using a computational
   modeling framework that combined segmented volumes of the vascularized
   brain, finite element models of the tissue voltage during DBS, and
   multi-compartment axon models to predict the direct electrophysiological
   effects of endovascular DBS. Main results. The models showed that: (1) a
   ring-electrode conforming to the vessel wall was more efficient at
   neural activation than a guidewire design, (2) increasing the length of
   a ring-electrode had minimal effect on neural activation thresholds, (3)
   large variability in neural activation occurred with suboptimal
   placement of a ring-electrode along the targeted vessel, and (4)
   activation thresholds for the fornix and SgCwm tracts were comparable
   for endovascular and stereotactic DBS, though endovascular DBS was able
   to produce significantly larger contralateral activation for a
   unilateral implantation. Significance. Together, these results suggest
   that endovascular DBS can serve as a complementary approach to
   stereotactic DBS in select cases.}},

   Double-Stranded DNA Packaging Motor}},

Abstract = {{The tailed double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophage phi 29 packages its
   19.3-kbp genome into a preassembled procapsid structure by using a
   transiently assembled phage-encoded molecular motor. This process is
   remarkable considering that compaction of DNA to near-crystalline
   densities within the confined space of the capsid requires that the
   packaging motor work against significant entropic, enthalpic, and
   DNA-bending energies. The motor consists of three phage-encoded
   components: the dodecameric connector protein gp10, an oligomeric RNA
   molecule known as the prohead RNA (pRNA), and the homomeric ring ATPase
   gp16. Although atomic resolution structures of the connector and
   different pRNA subdomains have been determined, the mechanism of
   self-assembly and the resulting stoichiometry of the various motor
   components on the phage capsid have been the subject of considerable
   controversy. Here a subnanometer asymmetric cryoelectron microscopy
   (cryo-EM) reconstruction of a connector-pRNA complex at a unique vertex
   of the procapsid conclusively demonstrates the pentameric symmetry of
   the pRNA and illuminates the relative arrangement of the connector and
   the pRNA. Additionally, a combination of biochemical and cryo-EM
   analyses of motor assembly intermediates suggests a sequence of
   molecular events that constitute the pathway by which the motor
   assembles on the head, thereby reconciling conflicting data regarding
   pRNA assembly and stoichiometry. Taken together, these data provide new
   insight into the assembly, structure, and mechanism of a complex
   molecular machine.
   IMPORTANCE
   Viruses consist of a protein shell, or capsid, that protects and
   surrounds their genetic material. Thus, genome encapsidation is a
   fundamental and essential step in the life cycle of any virus. In dsDNA
   viruses, powerful molecular motors essentially pump the viral DNA into a
   preformed protein shell. This article describes how a viral dsDNA
   packaging motor self-assembles on the viral capsid and provides insight
   into its mechanism of action.}},

   Fifteen healthy subjects (8 male, 7 female, 28 +/- A 10 years) performed

   Lumbar angle, segmental margin strains, axial displacements,

   course of flexion were measured.
   L4-L5 had the largest posterior margin Green strain (65 \%). Each
   segment displayed more axial displacement than A-P translation. Peak
   vertebral angulation occurred at approximately 75 \% of peak flexion
   during the extension phase.
   L4-L5 exhibited the largest anterior and posterior margin strains (29

Abstract = {{Consider a downlink MIMO heterogeneous wireless network with multiple
   cells, each containing many mobile users and a number of base stations
   with varying capabilities. A central task in the management of such a
   network is to assign each user to a base station and design a linear
   transmit strategy to ensure a satisfactory level of network performance.
   In this work, we propose a formulation for the joint base station
   assignment and linear transceiver design problem based on the
   maximization of a system wide utility. We first establish the
   NP-hardness of the resulting optimization problem for a large family of
   a-fairness utility functions. Then, we propose an efficient algorithm to
   approximately solve this problem for a variety of different utility
   functions. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm
   can achieve significantly higher levels of system throughput and user
   fairness than what is possible by optimizing the precoders alone.}},

Abstract = {{Per-core voltage domains can improve performance under a power
   constraint. Most commercial processors, however, only have a single
   voltage domain for all processor cores. This is because splitting the
   single voltage domain into per-core voltage domains and powering them
   with multiple off-chip voltage regulators (VRs) incur a high cost for
   the platform and package designs. Although using on-chip switching VRs
   can be an alternative solution, integrating high-quality inductors for
   VRs with cores has been a technical challenge. In this paper, we propose
   a cost-effective power delivery technique to support per-core voltage
   domains. Our technique is based on the observations that: 1)
   core-to-core (C2C) voltage variations are relatively small for most
   execution intervals when the voltages/frequencies are optimized to
   maximize performance under a power constraint and 2) per-core
   power-gating devices augmented with feedback control circuitry can serve
   as low-cost VRs that can provide high efficiency in situations like 1).
   Our experimental results show that processors using our technique can
   achieve power efficiency as high as those using the per-core on-chip
   switching VRs at a much lower cost.}},

Abstract = {{Current EC differentiation protocols are inefficient, and the phenotypes
   of the differentiated ECs are only briefly stable, which significantly
   inhibits their utility for basic science research. Here, a remarkably
   more efficient hiPSC-EC differentiation protocol that incorporates a
   three-dimensional (3D) fibrin scaffold is presented. With this protocol,
   up to 45\% of the differentiated hiPSCs assumed an EC phenotype, and
   after purification, greater than 95\% of the cells displayed the EC
   phenotype (based on CD31 expression). The hiPSC-ECs continued to display
   EC characteristics for 4 weeks in vitro. Gene and protein expression
   levels of CD31, CD144 and von Willebrand factor-8 (vWF-8) were
   significantly up-regulated in differentiated hiPSC-ECs. hiPSC-ECs also
   have biological function to up-take Dil-conjugated acetylated LDL
   (Dil-ac-LDL) and form tubular structures on Matrigel. Collectively,
   these data demonstrate that a 3D differentiation protocol can
   efficiently generate ECs from hiPSCs and, furthermore, the
   differentiated hiPSC-ECs are functional and can maintain EC fate up to 4
   weeks in vitro. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The antifungal drug, 5-fluorocytosine (FC), is marketed as a capsule
   (250 or 500 mg strength) instead of the preferred tablet dosage form.
   Through systematic characterization of solid-state properties, including
   mechanical properties, we identify tabletability and poor physical
   stability of FC as the problems that likely have prevented the
   successful development of a FC tablet product. We then design an FC
   oxalate 2:1 salt (FCOXA21), based on established relationship between
   crystal structure and properties, to address these deficient properties.
   FCOXA21 is subsequently used to develop a direct compression tablet
   product using predictive and material-sparing powder characterization
   tools, that is, ring shear cell for powder flowability and compaction
   simulator for powder tabletability. The initial tablet formulation,
   which contains 84.5\% (wt \%) FCOXA21, exhibits excellent tabletability
   but inadequate flowability. We solve the powder flowability problem
   through controlling the particle size of FCOXA21. A batch of FCOXA21
   tablets (500 mg FC equivalent dose) is then prepared. Finally,
   systematic evaluation on tablet weight variation, content uniformity,
   friability, and dissolution using standard methods confirms the
   commercial manufacturability of FC tablets. Through this work, we have
   demonstrated the potential of integrated crystal and particle
   engineering in expediting the development of tablet products of
   challenging drugs using the economical direct compression process. (c)

Abstract = {{Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK) cell lines are used in the production of
   veterinary vaccines and recombinant proteins. To facilitate
   transcriptome analysis of BHK cell lines, we embarked on an effort to
   sequence, assemble, and annotate transcript sequences from a recombinant
   BHK cell line and Syrian hamster liver and brain. RNA-seq data were
   supplemented with 6,170 Sanger ESTs from parental and recombinant BHK
   lines to generate 221,583 contigs. Annotation by homology to other
   species, primarily mouse, yielded more than 15,000 unique Ensembl mouse
   gene IDs with high coverage of KEGG canonical pathways. High coverage of
   enzymes and isoforms was seen for cell metabolism and N-glycosylation
   pathways, areas of highest interest for biopharmaceutical production.
   With the high sequencing depth in RNA-seq data, we set out to identify
   single-nucleotide variants in the transcripts. A majority of the
   high-confidence variants detected in both hamster tissue libraries
   occurred at a frequency of 50\%, indicating their origin as heterozygous
   germline variants. In contrast, the cell line libraries' variants showed
   a wide range of occurrence frequency, indicating the presence of a
   heterogeneous population in cultured cells. The extremely high coverage
   of transcripts of highly abundant genes in RNA-seq enabled us to
   identify low-frequency variants. Experimental verification through
   Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of two variants in the cDNA of
   a highly expressed gene in the BHK cell line. Furthermore, we detected
   seven potential missense mutations in the genes of the growth signaling
   pathways that may have arisen during the cell line derivation process.
   The development and characterization of a BHK reference transcriptome
   will facilitate future efforts to understand, monitor, and manipulate
   BHK cells. Our study on sequencing variants is crucial for improved
   understanding of the errors inherent in high-throughput sequencing and
   to increase the accuracy of variant calling in BHK or other systems.

Journal = {{GEOTHERMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{50}},
Pages = {{213-219}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Borehole creation involve complex thermal phenomena such as the
   injection of a fluid to cool the cutting tool and carry debris to the
   surface, generation of heat caused by the cutting tool, and the thermal
   interactions between the flowing fluid and the stationary rock. These
   phenomena alter the temperature of the rock from its undisturbed state.
   An accurate characterization of the temperatures within the rock prior
   to the drilling operation is necessary for resource extraction,
   geothermal heat conduction calculations, and for paleoclimate studies.
   Disturbances in the rock temperature can lead to uncertainties in these
   calculated quantities and in the application of the inverse method.
   Presently, methods are available which treat the flowing fluid in a
   simplified manner, often as a stationary medium, and allow estimation of
   the temperature disturbances in the rock wall. Nevertheless, to the best
   knowledge of the authors, there are no published studies which fully
   include the fluid flow in the borehole during the drilling operation and
   its direct impact on temperatures. Additionally, the impact of the heat
   generation at the drill head on the temperatures in the fluid and the
   surrounding rock have not fully been studied.
   A method is proposed for determining temperatures within boreholes and
   the surrounding rock both during and after the drilling operation. The
   method encompasses all the issues listed above. It was discovered that
   the coolant temperature is dependent upon location within the borehole,
   and the relaxation time of rock temperatures to their equilibrium values
   varies with depth in the borehole. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A concept for fusing information from the kinematics describing human
   locomotion with body-fixed sensors for the purpose of in situ gait
   monitoring is studied. This is done by using an individual's gait
   patterns (as captured by a simplified kinematic model) with acceleration
   measurements made at key points on the body. The gait patterns are
   expressed as nominal relations between shank, thigh, and stance leg
   angles during normal walking. It is shown how the use of known gait
   patterns reduces the required number of sensors attached to the body
   that are required for a sensor-based monitoring of gait. The feasibility
   of the approach is demonstrated using a single acceleration measurement
   at the ankle to estimate limb angles and step size in situ. Such gait
   monitoring may be used for the evaluations of a subject's overall
   quality of gait through the determination of flexions at the knees and
   hip. In addition, step sizes, distance walked, and speed can be
   estimated. Apart from gait analysis, the method can be used for remotely
   monitoring the safety of individuals to the extent this can be done
   through consideration of the state of gait.}},

Pages = {{2019-2039}},

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the stability of the discrete model proposed by
   Richard et al. (2004 {[}1], 2007 {[}2]) to study the self-excited axial
   and torsional vibrations of deep drilling systems. This model, which
   relies on a rate-independent bit/rock interaction law, reduces to a
   coupled system of state-dependent delay differential equations governing
   the axial and angular perturbations to the stationary motion of the bit.
   A linear stability analysis indicates that, although the steady-state
   motion of the bit is always unstable, the nature of the instability
   depends on the nominal angular velocity Omega(0) of the drillstring
   imposed at the rig. On the one hand, if Omega(0) is larger than a
   critical velocity Omega(c), the angular dynamics is responsible for the
   instability. However, on the timescale of the resonance period of the
   drillstring viewed as a torsional pendulum, the system behaves like a
   marginally stable one, provided that exogenous perturbations are of
   limited magnitude. The instability then only appears on a much larger
   timescale, in the form of slowly growing oscillations that ultimately
   lead to an undesired drilling regime such as bit-bouncing or stick-slip
   vibrations. On the other hand, if Omega(0) is smaller than Omega(c), the
   instability manifests itself on the timescale of the bit motion due to a
   dominating unstable axial dynamics; perturbations to the steady-state
   motion then rapidly degenerate into stick-slip limit cycles or
   bit-bouncing. For typical deep drilling field conditions, the critical
   angular velocity Omega(c) is virtually independent of the axial force
   acting on the bit and of the bit bluntness. It can be approximated by a
   power law monomial, a function of known parameters of the drilling
   system and of the intrinsic specific energy (a quantity characterizing
   the energy required to drill a particular rock). This approximation
   holds on account that the dissipation in the drilling structure is
   negligible with respect to that taking place through the bit/rock
   interaction, as is typically the case. These findings are further
   illustrated on an example of deep drilling and shown to match the trends
   observed in the field. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The stability of cubic CaSiO3 perovskite (CaPv) at high temperatures and
   pressures is investigated by vibrational normal-mode analysis. We
   compute power spectra of mode autocorrelation functions using a recently
   developed hybrid approach combining ab initio molecular dynamics with
   lattice dynamics. These power spectra, together with the probability
   distributions of atomic displacements, indicate that cubic CaPv is
   stabilized at T similar to 600 K and P similar to 26 GPa. We then
   utilize the concept of phonon quasiparticles to characterize the
   vibrational properties of cubic CaPv at high temperature and obtain
   anharmonic phonon dispersions through the whole Brillouin zone. Such
   temperature-dependent phonon dispersions pave the way for more accurate
   calculations of free-energy, thermodynamic, and thermoelastic properties
   of cubic CaPv at Earth's lower mantle conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Monte Carlo simulations in the grand canonical and Gibbs ensembles were
   carried out to predict the adsorption isotherms of argon, nitrogen, and
   n-perfluorohexane in BCR-704, a faujasite-type calcium aluminosilicate
   with a Si/Al ratio of 1.6. Starting from existing force fields for the
   sorbate molecules and a transferable force field for all-silica
   zeolites, attempts were made to develop a force field that would
   reproduce the experimentally determined argon and nitrogen adsorption
   isotherms in BCR-704. However, good agreement for the nitrogen
   adsorption isotherm could only be obtained either for a set of force
   field parameters with a greatly reduced partial charge on the calcium
   cation or using a larger partial charge and assuming that co-adsorbed
   water molecules are present at the temperature used for the argon and
   nitrogen adsorption isotherms. Predictions of the adsorption isotherm
   for n-perfluorohexane in BCR-704 using the latter force field parameters
   and the FAU-X structure with a water/calcium ratio of 1 yield good
   agreement with the experimental benchmark data. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

   L1(0)-FePt: Au composite layer and the soft Fe layer. Moreover, the
   magnetic domain configuration study reveals the domain wall assisted

   reverse nucleation and magnetization reversal in the L1(0)-FePt: Au

Number = {{12}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we report a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) detection scheme
   without the presence of any external magnetic field. The proposed
   magnetic sensor uses a patterned groove structure within the sensor so
   that no external magnetic field is needed to magnetize the MNPs. An
   example is given based on a giant magnetoresistance (GMR) sensing device
   with a spin valve structure. For this structure, the detection of MNPs
   located inside the groove and near the free layer is demonstrated under
   no external magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations are performed to
   calculate the signal to noise level of this detection scheme. A maximum
   signal to noise ratio (SNR) of 18.6 dB from one iron oxide magnetic
   nanoparticle with 8 nm radius is achieved. As proof of concept, this
   external-field-free GMR sensor with groove structure of 200 nm x 200 nm
   is fabricated using a photo and an electron beam integrated lithography
   process. Using this sensor, the feasibility demonstration of the
   detection SNR of 9.3 dB is achieved for 30 mu l magnetic nanoparticles
   suspension (30 nm iron oxide particles, 1mg/ml). This proposed
   external-field-free sensor structure is not limited to GMR devices and
   could be applicable to other magnetic biosensing devices. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{APOBEC3G belongs to a family of DNA cytosine deaminases that are
   involved in the restriction of a broad number of retroviruses including
   human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). Prior studies have
   identified two distinct mechanistic steps in Vif-deficient HIV-1
   restriction: packaging into virions and deaminating viral cDNA.
   APOBEC3A, for example, although highly active, is not packaged and is
   therefore not restrictive. APOBEC3G, on the other hand, although having
   weaker enzymatic activity, is packaged into virions and is strongly
   restrictive. Although a number of studies have described the propensity
   for APOBEC3 oligomerization, its relevance to HIV-1 restriction remains
   unclear. Here, we address this problem by examining APOBEC3
   oligomerization in living cells using molecular brightness analysis. We
   find that APOBEC3G forms high-order multimers as a function of protein
   concentration. In contrast, APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C and APOBEC2 are monomers
   at all tested concentrations. Among other members of the APOBEC3 family,
   we show that the multimerization propensities of APOBEC3B, APOBEC3D,
   APOBEC3F and APOBEC3H (haplotype II) bear more resemblance to APOBEC3G
   than to APOBEC3A/3C/2. Prior studies have shown that all of these
   multimerizing APOBEC3 proteins, but not the monomeric family members,
   have the capacity to package into HIV-1 particles and restrict viral
   infectivity. This correlation between oligomerization and restriction is
   further evidenced by two different APOBEC3G mutants, which are each
   compromised for multimerization, packaging and HIV-1 restriction.
   Overall, our results imply that multimerization of APOBEC3 proteins may
   be related to the packaging mechanism and ultimately to virus
   restriction. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{It has long been presumed that activation of the apoptosis-initiating
   Death Receptor 5, as well as other structurally homologous members of
   the TNF-receptor superfamily, relies on ligand-stabilized trimerization
   of noninteracting receptor monomers. We and others have proposed an
   alternate model in which the TNF-receptor dimer-sitting at the vertices
   of a large supramolecular receptor network of ligand-bound receptor
   trimers-undergoes a closed-to-open transition, propagated through a
   scissorslike conformational change in a tightly bundled transmembrane
   (TM) domain dimer. Here we have combined electron paramagnetic resonance
   spectroscopy and potential-of-mean force calculations on the isolated TM
   domain of the long isoform of DR5. The experiments and calculations both
   independently validate that the opening transition is intrinsic to the
   physical character of the TM domain dimer, with a significant energy
   barrier separating the open and closed states.}},

Abstract = {{Growth of monolayer, bi-layer, and tri-layer single-crystalline graphene
   (SCG) using chemical vapor deposition method is reported. SCG's
   mechanical properties and single-crystalline nature were characterized
   and verified by atomic force microscope and Raman spectroscopy.
   Electro-mechanical switches based on mono-and bi-layer SCG were
   fabricated, and the superb properties of SCG enable the switches to
   operate at pull-in voltage as low as 1V, and high switching speed about
   100 ns. These devices exhibit lifetime without a breakdown of over 5000
   cycles, far more durable than any other graphene nanoelectromechanical
   system switches reported. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Although feature selection is a well-developed research area, there is
   an ongoing need to develop methods to make classifiers more efficient.
   One important challenge is the lack of a universal feature selection
   technique that produces similar outcomes with all types of classifiers.
   This is because all feature selection techniques have individual
   statistical biases, whereas classifiers exploit different statistical
   properties of data for evaluation. In numerous situations, this can put
   researchers into dilemma with regard to which feature selection method
   and classifiers to choose from a vast range of choices. In this article,
   we propose a technique that aggregates the consensus properties of
   various feature selection methods in order to develop a more optimal
   solution. The ensemble nature of our technique makes it more robust
   across various classifiers. In other words, it is stable toward
   achieving similar and, ideally, higher classification accuracy across a
   wide variety of classifiers. We quantify this concept of robustness with
   a measure known as the robustness index (RI). We perform an extensive

   dimensions, including arrythmia, lung cancer, Madelon, mfeat-fourier,

Abstract = {{A finite element, thermal capillary model is applied to study solute
   segregation in the horizontal ribbon growth of silicon. Results show a
   complicated redistribution of solute into the growing ribbon, with
   nearly constant composition in the upper portion of the crystal and high
   levels of solute incorporation in the lower portion. The redistribution
   pattern is explained by convective flow patterns and interfacial
   geometry in the system. Lower values of equilibrium partition
   coefficient and solute melt diffusivity contribute to more inhomogeneous
   crystal composition. Faster pull rates lead to more pronounced
   redistribution of solute in the crystal. Paradoxically, the
   inhomogeneous concentration levels in HRG ribbon may be beneficial;
   impurities accumulate towards a narrow bottom portion of the crystal,
   leaving a majority of the crystal relatively pure. (C) 2013 Elsevier

   analysis of major histocompatibility complex class I proteins in

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{66}},

Month = {{MAR 15}},
Abstract = {{Major histocompatibility complex class I proteins, MHC(I), are expressed
   in almost all nucleated cells and synthesized in the endoplasmic
   reticulum (ER). The orientation and mobility of these complexes are
   crucial in their biological function in the immune system, i.e., the
   cytosolic pathogen peptides loading and their presentation to T-cell
   receptors at the plasma membrane, where cell destruction is triggered.
   Here, we investigate the structural flexibility and associations of
   GFP-encoded MHC(I) alleles (H2L(d)), namely H2L(d)GFP(in) and
   H2L(d)GFP(out), in cultured mouse fibroblast cells. Time-resolved
   fluorescence anisotropy of H2L(d)GFP(in) in the ER indicates a dominant
   overall tumbling motion of 56 +/- 7 ns (ER), with a fast conformational
   flexibility, as compared with a restricted rotation of H2LdGFPout. At
   the single-molecule level, the diffusion coefficient of H2L(d)GFP(in)
   and H2L(d)GFP(out) in the ER is (1.8 +/- 0.5) x 10(-9) and (2.1 +/- 0.6)
   x 10(-9) cm(2)/s, respectively, as revealed by fluorescence correlation
   spectroscopy. A complementary immunoblotting of H2L(d)GFP constructs,
   isolated from mouse fibroblast cells, reveals band at 75 kDa as compared
   with 29 kDa of the free EGFP. These real-time dynamics provide new
   insights into the structural flexibility and intracellular associations
   of GFP-labeled MHC(I) alleles (H2L(d)) in living cells. (C) 2013

Title = {{Low-frequency spatial wave manipulation via phononic crystals with
   relaxed cell symmetry}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 14}},
Abstract = {{Phononic crystals enjoy unique wave manipulation capabilities enabled by
   their periodic topologies. On one hand, they feature frequency-dependent
   directivity, which allows directional propagation of selected modes even
   at low frequencies. However, the stellar nature of the propagation
   patterns and the inability to induce single-beam focusing represent
   significant limitations of this functionality. On the other hand, one
   can realize waveguides by defecting the periodic structure of a crystal
   operating in bandgap mode along some desired path. Waveguides of this
   type are only activated in the relatively high and narrow frequency
   bands corresponding to total bandgaps, which limits their potential
   technological applications. In this work, we introduce a class of
   phononic crystals with relaxed cell symmetry and we exploit symmetry
   relaxation of a population of auxiliary microstructural elements to
   achieve spatial manipulation of elastic waves at very low frequencies,
   in the range of existence of the acoustic modes. By this approach, we
   achieve focusing without modifying the default static properties of the
   medium and by invoking mechanisms that are well suited to envision
   adaptive configurations for semi-active wave control. (C) 2014 AIP

Abstract = {{Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs), including Crohn's disease (CD), are
   genetically linked to host pathways that implicate an underlying role
   for aberrant immune responses to intestinal microbiota. However,
   patterns of gut microbiome dysbiosis in IBD patients are inconsistent
   among published studies. Using samples from multiple gastrointestinal
   locations collected prior to treatment in new-onset cases, we studied
   the microbiome in the largest pediatric CD cohort to date. An axis
   defined by an increased abundance in bacteria which include
   Enterobacteriaceae, Pasteurellacaea, Veillonellaceae, and
   Fusobacteriaceae, and decreased abundance in Erysipelotrichales,
   Bacteroidales, and Clostridiales, correlates strongly with disease
   status. Microbiome comparison between CD patients with and without
   antibiotic exposure indicates that antibiotic use amplifies the
   microbial dysbiosis associated with CD. Comparing the microbial
   signatures between the ileum, the rectum, and fecal samples indicates
   that at this early stage of disease, assessing the rectal
   mucosal-associated microbiome offers unique potential for convenient and
   early diagnosis of CD.}},

Abstract = {{With noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) now constituting the majority of
   global mortality, there is a growing need for low-cost, noninvasive
   methods to diagnose and treat this class of diseases, especially in
   resource-limited settings. Molecular biomarkers combined with low-cost
   point-of-care assays constitute a potential solution for diagnosing
   NCDs, but the dearth of naturally occurring, predictive markers limits
   this approach. Here, we describe the design of exogenous agents that
   serve as synthetic biomarkers for NCDs by producing urinary signals that
   can be quantified by a companion paper test. These synthetic biomarkers
   are composed of nanoparticles conjugated to ligand-encoded reporters via
   protease-sensitive peptide substrates. Upon delivery, the nanoparticles
   passively target diseased sites, such as solid tumors or blood clots,
   where up-regulated proteases cleave the peptide substrates and release
   reporters that are cleared into urine. The reporters are engineered for
   detection by sandwich immunoassays, and we demonstrate their
   quantification directly from unmodified urine; furthermore, capture
   antibody specificity allows the probes to be multiplexed in vivo and
   quantified simultaneously by ELISA or paper lateral flow assay (LFA). We
   tailor synthetic biomarkers specific to colorectal cancer, a
   representative solid tumor, and thrombosis, a common cardiovascular
   disorder, and demonstrate urinary detection of these diseases in mouse
   models by paper diagnostic. Together, the LFA and injectable synthetic
   biomarkers, which could be tailored for multiple diseases, form a
   generalized diagnostic platform for NCDs that can be applied in almost
   any setting without expensive equipment or trained medical personnel.}},

Title = {{High quality factor polymeric Fabry-Perot resonators utilizing a polymer

Abstract = {{Optical resonators are used in a variety of applications ranging from
   sensors to lasers and signal routing in high volume communication
   networks. Achieving a high quality (Q) factor is necessary for higher
   sensitivity in sensing applications and for narrow linewidth light
   emission in most lasing applications. In this work, we propose a new
   approach to achieve a very high Q-factor in polymeric Fabry-Perot
   resonators by conquering light diffraction inside the optical cavity.
   This can be achieved by inducing a refractive index feature inside the
   optical cavity that simply creates a waveguide between the two mirrors.
   This approach eliminates diffraction loss from the cavity and therefore
   the Q-factor is only limited by mirror loss and absorption. To
   demonstrate this claim, a device has been fabricated consisting of two
   dielectric Bragg reflectors with a 100 mu m layer of photosensitive
   polymer between them. The refractive index of this polymer can be
   modified utilizing standard photo-lithography processes. The measured
   finesse of the fabricated device was 692 and the Q-factor was 55000.

Title = {{Entropically Stabilized Dislocations}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{112}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{MAR 10}},
Abstract = {{Dislocations are line defects that play a key role in the plasticity of
   crystalline materials and affect their thermal, chemical, and electrical
   properties. Typically dislocations are treated as stable defects; e.g.,
   the equilibrium core structure of a dislocation is obtained by
   minimizing the crystal potential energy with respect to atom positions.
   Here we show for the first time the possibility of ``entropically
   stabilized dislocations{''} that exist due to entropic effects without a
   corresponding potential energy well. An entropically stabilized
   dislocation was discovered in an accelerated multiscale quasicontinuum
   simulation. Its entropic nature was verified with fully atomistic free
   energy calculations and explained by a simple continuum-based model.
   This result has important consequences for the study of dislocations as
   well as for temporal multiscale methods that use information from the
   potential energy surface to accelerate time in molecular simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Ion gels comprising ABA triblock copolymers and ionic liquids have
   received much attention as functional materials in numerous
   applications, especially as gate dielectrics in organic transistors.
   Here we have expanded the functionality of ion gels by demonstrating
   low-voltage, flexible electrochemiluminescent (ECL) devices using
   patterned ion gels containing redox-active luminophores. The ECL devices
   consisted only of a 30 mu m thick emissive gel and two electrodes and
   were fabricated on indium tin oxide-coated substrates (e.g., polyester)
   simply by solution-casting the ECL gel and brush-painting a top Ag
   electrode. The triblock copolymer employed in the gel was
   polystyrene-block-poly(methyl methacrylate)-block-polystyrene, where the
   solvophobic polystyrene end blocks associate into micellar cross-links
   in the versatile ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide {[}EMI]{[}TFSI]). An ECL gel
   containing similar to 6.25 wt \% Ru(bpy)(3)Cl-2 (relative to
   {[}EMI]{[}TFSI]) as the luminophore turned on at an AC peak-to-peak
   voltage as low as 2.6 V (i.e., -1.3 to +1.3 V) and showed a relatively
   rapid response (sub-ms). The wavelength of maximum emission was 610 nm
   (red-orange). With the use of an iridium(III) complex,
   Ir(diFppy)(2)(bpy)PF6 {[}diFppy = 2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine; bpy
   = 2,2'-bipyridyl], the emitting color was tuned to a maximum wavelength
   of 540 nm (green). Moreover, when a blended luminophore system
   containing a 60:40 mixture of Ru(bpy)(3)(2+) and Ir(diFppy)(2)(bpy)(+)
   was used in the emissive layer, the luminance of red-orange-colored
   light was enhanced by a factor of 2, which is explained by the
   generation of the additional excited state Ru(bpy)(3)(2+){*} by a
   coreactant pathway with Ir(diFppy)(2)(bpy)(+){*} in addition to the
   usual annihilation pathway. This is the first time that enhanced ECL has
   been achieved in ion gels (or ionic liquids) using a coreactant.
   Overall, the results indicate that ECL ion gels are attractive
   multifunctional materials for printed electronics.}},

Abstract = {{The use of quantitative disease resistance (QDR) is a promising strategy
   for promoting durable resistance to plant pathogens, but genes involved
   in QDR are largely unknown. To identify genetic components and
   accelerate improvement of QDR in legumes to the root pathogen
   Aphanomyces euteiches, we took advantage of both the recently generated
   massive genomic data for Medicago truncatula and natural variation of
   this model legume.
   A high-density (approximate to 5.1 million single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs)) genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed
   with both in vitro and glasshouse phenotyping data collected for 179
   lines.
   GWAS identified several candidate genes and pinpointed two independent
   major loci on the top of chromosome 3 that were detected in both
   phenotyping methods. Candidate SNPs in the most significant locus
   (sigma(2)(A) = 23\%) were in the promoter and coding regions of an F-box
   protein coding gene. Subsequent qRT-PCR and bioinformatic analyses
   performed on 20 lines demonstrated that resistance is associated with
   mutations directly affecting the interaction domain of the F-box protein
   rather than gene expression.
   These results refine the position of previously identified QTL to
   specific candidate genes, suggest potential molecular mechanisms, and
   identify new loci explaining QDR against A. euteiches.}},

   drivers of multiple cancer types. These screens have already identified
   hundreds of candidate cancer-promoting mutations. These can be used to
   develop new mouse models for further study, which may prove useful for
   therapeutic testing. SB technology may also hold the key for rapid

Abstract = {{Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are soft tissue
   sarcomas that occur spontaneously, or from benign plexiform
   neurofibromas, in the context of the genetic disorder Neurofibromatosis
   Type 1 (NF1). The current standard treatment includes surgical
   resection, high-dose chemotherapy, and/or radiation. To date, most
   targeted therapies have failed to demonstrate effectiveness against
   plexiform neurofibromas and MPNSTs. Recently, several studies suggested
   that the mTOR and MAPK pathways are involved in the formation and
   progression of MPNSTs. Everolimus (RAD001) inhibits the mTOR and is
   currently FDA approved for several types of solid tumors. PD-0325901
   (PD-901) inhibits MEK, a component of the MAPK pathway, and is currently
   in clinical trials. Here, we show in vitro than MPNST cell lines are
   more sensitive to inhibition of cellular growth by Everolimus and PD-901
   than immortalized human Schwann cells. In combination, these drugs
   synergistically inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis. In two
   genetically engineered mouse models of MPNST formation, modeling both
   sporadic and NF1-associated MPNSTs, Everolimus, or PD-901 treatment
   alone each transiently reduced tumor burden and size, and extended
   lifespan. However, prolonged treatment of each single agent resulted in
   the development of resistance and reactivation of target pathways.
   Combination therapy using Everolimus and PD-901 had synergistic effects
   on reducing tumor burden and size, and increased lifespan. Combination
   therapy allowed persistent and prolonged reduction in signaling through
   both pathways. These data suggest that co-targeting mTOR and MEK may be
   effective in patients with sporadic or NF1-associated MPNSTs.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the past two decades, numerous studies characterized the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and net energy balance of corn ethanol
   production in the USA. A wide range of reported values resulted from
   differences in the vintage of the data used to evaluate the ethanol
   conversion technology and the agricultural practices of corn production,
   which evolved substantially during the rapid growth phase of the
   industry. Methodological differences in life cycle assessments also
   caused the reported values to vary widely. With corn dry mills growing
   from 30\% of total installed ethanol production capacity in 1990 to
   80-90\% from 2006 to 2011, we document the evolution of this industry
   using vintage-specific data to analyze selected energy and environmental
   metrics, including GHG emissions, fossil energy use, direct land use,
   and GHG emissions reduction per hectare of land harvested for ethanol
   production. Our estimates indicate that production and use of corn
   ethanol emitted 44\% fewer GHG emissions, consumed 54\% less fossil
   energy and required 44\% less land in 2010 compared to 1990 (on a life
   cycle basis). Our review and analysis point to strategies for reducing
   the carbon footprint of the corn dry mill industry by building on the
   progress already achieved. Using biomass (e.g. residues from corn
   production) for process heat or combined heat and power is one such
   strategy. Additional environmental benefits are projected from the
   adoption of integrated gasification combined cycle technology (using
   corn residues), which leads to energy-self-sufficient mills or net
   electricity producers depending on the power system configuration. (c)

Abstract = {{A novel concept of fast microwave assisted pyrolysis (fMAP) in the
   presence of microwave absorbents was presented and examined. Wood
   sawdust and corn stover were pyrolyzed by means of microwave heating and
   silicon carbide (SiC) as microwave absorbent. The bio-oil was
   characterized, and the effects of temperature, feedstock loading,
   particle sizes, and vacuum degree were analyzed. For wood sawdust, a
   temperature of 480 degrees C, 50 grit SiC, with 2 g/min of biomass
   feeding, were the optimal conditions, with a maximum bio-oil yield of 65
   wt.\%. For corn stover, temperatures ranging from 490 degrees C to 560
   degrees C, biomass particle sizes from 0.9 mm to 1.9 mm, and vacuum
   degree lower than 100 mmHg obtained a maximum bio-oil yield of 64 wt.\%.

Abstract = {{In the present study, a microwave-assisted biomass gasification system
   was developed for syngas production. Three catalysts including Fe, Co
   and Ni with Al2O3 support were examined and compared for their effects
   on syngas production and tar removal. Experimental results showed that
   microwave is an effective heating method for biomass gasification.
   Ni/Al2O3 was found to be the most effective catalyst for syngas
   production and tar removal. The gas yield reached above 80\% and the
   composition of tar was the simplest when Ni/Al2O3 catalyst was used. The
   optimal ratio of catalyst to biomass was determined to be 1:5-1:3. The
   addition of steam was found to be able to improve the gas production and
   syngas quality. Results of XRD analyses demonstrated that Ni/Al2O3
   catalyst has good stability during gasification process. Finally, a new
   concept of microwave-assisted dual fluidized bed gasifier was put
   forward for the first time in this study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{We consider a retailer selling a single product with limited on-hand
   inventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives
   according to a Poisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a
   single action taken by the retailer (such as price adjustment, sales
   commission, advertisement intensity, etc.). The relationship between the
   action and the demand rate is not known in advance. However, the
   retailer is able to learn the optimal action on the fly as she maximizes
   her total expected revenue based on the observed demand reactions.
   Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic
   learning-while-doing algorithm that only involves function value
   estimation to achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs
   a series of shrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices
   within that interval using a set of carefully chosen parameters. We
   prove that the performance of our algorithm is among the best of all
   possible algorithms in terms of the asymptotic regret (the relative loss
   compared to the full information optimal solution). Our result closes
   the performance gaps between parametric and nonparametric learning and
   between the post-price mechanism and the customer-bidding mechanism.
   Important managerial insight from this research is that the values of
   information on both the parametric form of the demand function as well
   as each customer's exact reservation price are less important than prior
   literature suggests. Our results also suggest that firms would be better
   off to perform dynamic learning and action concurrently rather than
   sequentially.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the limited power constraint in sensors, dynamic scheduling with
   data quality management is strongly preferred in the practical
   deployment of long-term wireless sensor network applications. We could
   reduce energy consumption by turning off (i.e., duty cycling) sensor,
   however, at the cost of low-sensing fidelity due to sensing gaps
   introduced. Typical techniques treat data quality management as an
   isolated process for individual nodes. And existing techniques have
   investigated how to collaboratively reduce the sensing gap in space and
   time domain; however, none of them provides a rigorous approach to
   confine sensing error is within desirable bound when seeking to optimize
   the tradeoff between energy consumption and accuracy of predictions. In
   this paper, we propose and evaluate a scheduling algorithm based on
   error inference between collaborative sensor pairs, called CIES. Within
   a node, we use a sensing probability bound to control tolerable sensing
   error. Within a neighborhood, nodes can trigger additional sensing
   activities of other nodes when inferred sensing error has aggregately
   exceeded the tolerance. The main objective of this work is to develop a
   generic scheduling mechanism for collaborative sensors to achieve the
   error-bounded scheduling control in monitoring applications. We
   conducted simulations to investigate system performance using historical
   soil temperature data in Wisconsin-Minnesota area. The simulation
   results demonstrate that the system error is confined within the
   specified error tolerance bounds and that a maximum of 60 percent of the
   energy savings can be achieved, when the CIES is compared to several
   fixed probability sensing schemes such as eSense. And further simulation
   results show the CIES scheme can achieve an improved performance when
   comparing the metric of a prediction error with baseline schemes. We
   further validated the simulation and algorithms by constructing a lab
   test bench to emulate actual environment monitoring applications. The
   results show that our approach is effective and efficient in tracking
   the dramatic temperature shift in dynamic environments.}},

Abstract = {{Bed load transport is a highly complex process. The probability density
   function (PDF) of particle velocities results from the local particle
   momentum variability in response to fluid drag and interactions with the
   bed. Starting from the forces exerted on a single particle under low
   transport rates (i.e., rolling and sliding regimes), we derive here the
   nonlinear stochastic Langevin equation (LE) to describe the dynamics of
   a single particle, accounting for both the deterministic and the
   stochastic components of such forces. Then, the Fokker-Planck equation
   (FPE), which describes the evolution of the PDF of the ensemble particle
   velocities, is derived from the LE. We show that the theoretical PDFs of
   both streamwise and cross-stream velocities obtained by solving the FPE
   under equilibrium conditions have exponential form (PDFs of both
   positive and negative velocities decay exponentially), consistent with
   the experimental data by Roseberry et al. (). Moreover, we theoretically
   show how the exponential-like PDF of an ensemble of particle velocities
   results from the forces exerted on a single particle. We also show that
   the simulated particle motions using the proposed Langevin model exhibit
   an emergent nonlinear relationship between hop distances and travel
   times (power law with exponent 5/3), in agreement with the experimental
   data, providing a statistical description of the particles' random
   motion in the context of a stochastic transport process. Finally, our
   study emphasizes that the motion of individual particles, described by
   the LE, and the behavior of the ensemble, described by the FPE, are
   connected within a statistical mechanics framework.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzes the nonlinear nature of gravel bed elevation data
   series obtained in a large scale flume facility for four different
   discharges, including spatial transect series and temporal series at a
   fixed location. The goals are to infer the degree of complexity, to
   assess the scales and features in the signals that mostly contribute to
   this complexity, and to discern the difference in the manner in which
   this complexity is expressed in time and space. The asymmetry series
   (magnitude of the first-order derivative of the signal over a separation
   distance, , raised to the third power) of the bed elevation data forms
   the basis of our nonlinearity analysis. An important and novel dimension
   is the adoption of a recently introduced approach to surrogate data
   generation, gradual wavelet reconstruction. This produces partially
   linearized counterparts of the original series that preserve an
   increasing degree of the underlying nonlinear structure in the original
   data, while randomizing the rest. This allows us to discern the
   difference in the manner in which the nonlinear asymmetry is expressed
   in the temporal and spatial data series. Comparison in the real and
   phase space of the original and surrogate series is performed, and the
   analysis reveals that the complexity of both spatial and temporal series
   increases with discharge and that the nature of nonlinearity is
   quantitatively and qualitatively different. For the spatial series,
   asymmetry is expressed at large scales and is shown to result from the
   organization of intermediate scale features. In contrast, asymmetry in
   the temporal series is a smaller-scale phenomenon. This is a consequence
   of the scale-dependent propagating velocity of topographic features. Our
   results have implications for understanding the complexity of geomorphic
   processes as a function of the space and time scale considered: the
   complexity over the bed form Lagrangian time scale is different in
   nature to that over the flow velocity Lagrangian time scale.}},

Volume = {{140}},

Month = {{MAR 1}},
Abstract = {{Data and models of nonmotorized traffic on multiuse urban trails are
   needed to improve planning and management of urban transportation
   systems. Negative binomial regression models are appropriate and useful
   when dependent variables are nonnegative integers with overdispersion
   like traffic counts. This paper presents eight negative binomial models
   for estimating urban trail traffic using 1,898 daily mixed-mode traffic
   counts from active infrared monitors at six locations in Minneapolis,
   Minnesota. These models include up to 10 independent variables that
   represent sociodemographic, built environment, weather, and temporal
   characteristics. A general model can be used to estimate traffic at
   locations where traffic has not been monitored. A six-location model
   with dummy variables for each monitoring site rather than
   neighborhood-specific variables can be used to estimate traffic at
   existing locations when counts from monitors are not available. Six
   trail-specific models are appropriate for estimating variation in
   traffic in response to variations in weather and day of week. Validation
   results indicate that negative binomial models outperform models
   estimated by ordinary least squares regression. These new models
   estimate traffic within approximately 16.3\% error, on average, which is
   reasonable for planning and management purposes.}},

Abstract = {{A superheated steam drying (SSD) model was developed in Aspen Plus

   production model developed for a 190 million litre per year corn ethanol
   plant. The BIGCC system was fuelled with either corn stover or a mixture
   of syrup and corn stover at a rate of 110 MW. Results were compared to
   estimates for steam tube drying (STD). Energy consumed for the SSD was
   759-804 kJ kg(-1) of water removed compared to 2660 -2690 kJ kg(-1) for
   the STD. Approximately 1.3 l of water were recovered per litre of
   ethanol produced with the SSD, with none for the STD. Less power was
   generated in the BIGCC system with SSD due to its smaller heat sink than
   for the BIGCC system with STD. (C) 2014 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Routing congestion has become a critical layout challenge in nanoscale
   circuits since it is a critical factor in determining the routability of
   a design. An unroutable design is not useful even though it closes on
   all other design metrics. Fast design closure can only be achieved by
   accurately evaluating whether a design is routable or not early in the
   design cycle. Lately, it has become common to use a ``light mode{''}
   version of a global router to quickly evaluate the routability of a
   given placement. This approach suffers from three weaknesses: (i) it
   does not adequately model local routing resources, which can cause
   incorrect routability predictions that are only detected late, during
   detailed routing; (ii) the congestion maps obtained by it tend to have
   isolated hotspots surrounded by noncongested spots, called ``noisy
   hotspots{''}, which further affects the accuracy in routability
   evaluation; and (iii) the metrics used to represent congestion may yield
   numbers that do not provide sufficient intuition to the designer, and
   moreover, they may often fail to predict the routability accurately.
   This article presents solutions to these issues. First, we propose three
   approaches to model local routing resources. Second, we propose a
   smoothing technique to reduce the number of noisy hotspots and obtain a
   more accurate routability evaluation result. Finally, we develop a new
   metric which represents congestion maps with higher fidelity. We apply
   the proposed techniques to several industrial circuits and demonstrate
   that one can better predict and evaluate design routability and that
   congestion mitigation tools can perform much better to improve the
   design routability.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a rotated sense head is examined for densities of 2-7
   Tbits/in(2) recorded on granular media, such as that envisioned for 2-D
   magnetic recording. The key idea is that tightly placed shields are used
   to guarantee the resolution in the cross-track direction, and
   oversampled signal processing regains the lost resolution in the
   down-track direction. It also avoids the necessity for a complex 2-D
   detector and head array, or latency issues if a single head were
   employed in the normal orientation. Simulation shows that the new design
   achieves a density gain of 1.7X (single head) and 2.1X (head array) over
   a normally oriented single head at a target bit error rate (BER) of
   10(-3) with sampling period of 2 nm, minimum mean square error
   equalizer, and Viterbi detector. The new design shows greatly reduced
   BER relative to a normally oriented single head for all densities,
   including a very few grains per channel bit (<2).}},

Abstract = {{Co-reactions of 7.5-9.3 kPa of DME with 4 kPa of toluene, p-xylene, and
   4-ethyltoluene on H-ZSM-5 at 523-723 K at low conversions (<10 C\%) with
   varying isotopic feed compositions of C-13/C-12 show that carbons
   originating from the aromatic ring are incorporated into ethene and
   propene. A comparison of the predicted C-13-contents of ethene and
   propene postulated on the basis of the paring, side-chain, and
   ring-expansion aromatic dealkylation mechanisms based on the
   experimentally observed isotopologue distribution of
   1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene, and 4-ethyltoluene
   reveal that the predicted C-13-content of ethene and propene from
   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene via the paring mechanism most closely match
   the experimentally observed C-13-contents of ethene and propene (<10\%

   precursors examined. This work quantitatively shows that aromatic
   dealkylation to form ethene and propene occurs through the paring

Abstract = {{Objectives: In this study we evaluated the usability of the Gait
   Deviation Index (GDI), an index that summarizes the amount of deviation
   in movement from a standard norm, in adults with rheumatoid arthritis
   (RA). The aims of the study were to evaluate the ability of the GDI to
   identify gait deviations, assess inter-trial repeatability, and examine
   the relationship between the GDI and walking speed, physical disability,
   and pain.
   Method: Sixty-three adults with RA and 59 adults with typical gait
   patterns were included in this retrospective case control study.
   Following a three-dimensional gait analysis (3DGA), representative gait
   cycles were selected and GDI scores calculated. To evaluate the effect
   of walking speed, GDI scores were calculated using both a free-speed and
   a speed-matched reference set. Physical disability was assessed using
   the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and subjects rated their pain
   during walking.
   Results: Adults with RA had significantly increased gait deviations
   compared to healthy individuals, as shown by lower GDI scores {[}87.9
   (SD = 8.7) vs. 99.4 (SD = 8.3), p < 0.001]. This difference was also
   seen when adjusting for walking speed {[}91.7 (SD = 9.0) vs. 99.9 (SD =
   8.6), p < 0.001]. It was estimated that a change of >= 5 GDI units was
   required to account for natural variation in gait. There was no evident
   relationship between GDI and low/high RA-related physical disability and
   pain.
   Conclusions: The GDI seems to useful for identifying and summarizing
   gait deviations in individuals with RA. Thus, we consider that the GDI
   provides an overall measure of gait deviation that may reflect lower
   extremity pathology and may help clinicians to understand the impact of
   RA on gait dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Travel time estimation and prediction on urban arterials is an important
   component of Active Traffic and Demand Management Systems (ATDMS). This
   paper aims in using the information of GPS probes to augment less
   dynamic but available information describing arterial travel times. The
   direction followed in this paper chooses a cooperative approach in
   travel time estimation using static information describing arterial
   geometry and signal timing, semi-dynamic information of historical
   travel time distributions per time of day, and utilizes GPS probe
   information to augment and improve the latter. First, arterial travel
   times are classified by identifying different travel time states, then
   link travel time distributions are approximated using mixtures of normal
   distributions. If prior travel time data is available, travel time
   distributions can be estimated empirically. Otherwise, travel time
   distribution can be estimated based on signal timing and arterial
   geometry. Real-time GPS travel time data is then used to identify the
   current traffic condition based on Bayes Theorem. Moreover, these GPS
   data can also be used to update the parameters of the travel time
   distributions using a Bayesian update. The iterative update process
   makes the posterior distributions more and more accurate. Finally, two
   comprehensive case studies using the NGSIM Peachtree Street dataset, and
   GPS data of Washington Avenue in Minneapolis, were conducted. The first
   case study estimated prior travel time distributions based on signal
   timing and arterial geometry under different traffic conditions. Travel
   time data were classified and corresponding distributions were updated.
   In addition, results from the Bayesian update and EM algorithm were
   compared. The second case study first tested the methodologies based on
   real GPS data and showed the importance of sample size. In addition, a
   methodology was proposed to distinguish new traffic conditions in the
   second case study. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{1079-1090}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A control-oriented engine model is often used in the
   hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation environment for developing and
   validating the corresponding control strategies. For homogeneous charge
   compression ignition (HCCI) combustion, mixture heterogeneity should be
   considered in the control-oriented model to provide accurate combustion
   phase prediction. This paper describes a two-zone HCCI combustion model,
   where the in-cylinder charge is divided into the well-mixed and unmixed
   zones as the result of charge mixing. Simplified fluid dynamics is used
   to predict the residual gas fraction before the combustion phase starts,
   which defines the mass of the unmixed zone, during real-time
   simulations. The unmixed-zone size determines not only how well the
   in-cylinder charge is mixed, which affects the start of HCCI combustion,
   but also the resulting peak in-cylinder pressure and temperature during
   the combustion process. The developed model was validated in the HIL
   simulation environment. The HIL simulation results show that the
   proposed charge mixing and HCCI combustion model provides better
   agreement with the corresponding GT-Power simulation results than the
   previously developed one-zone model.}},

Volume = {{742}},
Pages = {{495-519}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{When a thin film of a colloidal suspension flows over a substrate,
   uneven distribution of the suspended particles can lead to an uneven
   coating. Motivated by this phenomenon, we analyse the flow of perfectly
   wetting films and droplets of colloidal suspensions down an inclined
   plane. Lubrication theory and the rapid-vertical-diffusion approximation
   are used to derive a coupled pair of one-dimensional partial
   differential equations describing the evolution of the interface height
   and particle concentration. Precursor films are assumed to be present,
   the colloidal particles are taken to be hard spheres, and particle and
   liquid dynamics are coupled through a concentration-dependent viscosity
   and diffusivity. We find that for sufficiently high Peclet numbers, even
   small initial concentration inhomogeneities produce viscosity gradients
   that cause the film or droplet front to evolve continuously in time
   instead of travelling without changing shape as happens in the absence
   of colloidal particles. At high enough particle concentrations, particle
   diffusion can lead to the formation of long-lived secondary flow fronts
   in films. Our results suggest that particle concentration gradients can
   have a dramatic influence on interface evolution in flowing films and
   droplets, a finding which may be relevant for understanding the onset of
   patterns that are observed experimentally.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Lipids created via microbial biosynthesis are a potential raw material
   to replace plant-based oil for biodiesel production. Oleaginous
   microbial species currently available are capable of accumulating high
   amount of lipids in their cell biomass, but rarely can directly utilize
   lignocellulosic biomass as substrates. Thus this research focused on the
   screening and selection of new fungal strains that generate both lipids
   and hydrolytic enzymes. To search for oleaginous fungal strains in the
   soybean plant, endophytic fungi and fungi close to the plant roots were
   studied as a microbial source. Among 33 endophytic fungal isolates
   screened from the soybean plant, 13 have high lipid content (> 20 \% dry
   biomass weight); among 38 fungal isolates screened from the soil
   surrounding the soybean roots, 14 have high lipid content. Also, five
   fungal isolates with both high lipid content and promising biomass
   production were selected for further studies on their cell growth, oil
   accumulation, lipid content and profile, utilization of various carbon
   sources, and cellulase production. The results indicate that most
   strains could utilize different types of carbon sources and some strains
   accumulated > 40 \% of the lipids based on the dry cell biomass weight.
   Among these promising strains, some Fusarium strains specifically showed
   considerable production of cellulase, which offers great potential for
   biodiesel production by directly utilizing inexpensive lignocellulosic
   material as feedstock.}},

Abstract = {{Sufficient conditions are derived for the global asymptotic
   synchronization of a class of identical nonlinear oscillators coupled
   through a linear time-invariant network. In particular, we focus on
   systems where oscillators are connected to a common node through
   identical branch impedances. For such networks, it is shown that the
   synchronization condition is independent of the number of oscillators
   and the value of the load impedance connected to the common node.
   Theoretical findings are then leveraged to control a system of parallel
   single-phase voltage source inverters serving an impedance load in an
   islanded microgrid application. The ensuing paradigm: i) does not
   necessitate communication between inverters, ii) is independent of
   system load, and iii) facilitates a modular design approach because the
   synchronization condition is independent of the number of oscillators.
   We present both simulation and experimental case studies to validate the
   analytical results and demonstrate the proposed application.}},

Abstract = {{Maintaining the reliability of integrated circuits as transistor sizes
   continue to shrink to nanoscale dimensions is a significant looming
   challenge for the industry. Computation on stochastic bit streams, which
   could replace conventional deterministic computation based on a binary
   radix, allows similar computation to be performed more reliably and
   often with less hardware area. Prior work discussed a variety of
   specific stochastic computational elements (SCEs) for applications such
   as artificial neural networks and control systems. Recently, very
   promising new SCEs have been developed based on finite-state machines
   (FSMs). In this paper, we introduce new SCEs based on FSMs for the task
   of digital image processing. We present five digital image processing
   algorithms as case studies of practical applications of the technique.
   We compare the error tolerance, hardware area, and latency of stochastic
   implementations to those of conventional deterministic implementations
   using binary radix encoding. We also provide a rigorous analysis of a
   particular function, namely the stochastic linear gain function, which
   had only been validated experimentally in prior work.}},

Abstract = {{Flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) can generate hydrophobic drug
   nanoparticles in similar to 100 nm with a much higher drug loading
   (e.g., > 40 wt \%) than traditional nanocarriers (e.g., < 20 wt \%).
   This paper studies the effects of drug molecules on nanoparticle
   stability made via FNP and demonstrates that chemically bonding a drug
   compound (e.g., paclitaxel) with a cleavable hydrophobic moiety of
   organosilicate (e.g., triethoxysilicate) is able to enhance the particle
   size stability. A nonionic amphiphilic diblock copolymer,
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLGA-b-PEG),
   is used as a model surfactant to provide steric stabilization. The
   experiments here show that the lower the drug solubility in the aqueous
   medium, the more stable the particles in terms of Ostwald ripening,
   which are consistent with the prediction by the LSW theory. The initial
   particle size distribution is sufficiently narrow and of insignificance
   to Ostwald ripening. To correlate the particle stability with
   hydrophobicity, this study introduces the n-octanol/water partition
   coefficient (LogP), a hydrophobicity indication, into the FNP technique.
   A comparison of various drugs and their analogues shows that LogP of a
   drug is a better hydrophobicity indication than the solubility parameter
   (delta) and correlates well with the particle stability. Empirically,
   with ACDLogP > similar to 12, nanoparticles have good stability; with
   similar to 2 < ACDLogP < similar to 9, nanoparticles show fast Ostwald
   ripening and interparticle recrystallization; with ACDLogP < similar to
   2, the drug is very likely difficult to form nanoparticles. This rule
   creates a quick way to predict particle stability for a randomly
   selected drug structure and helps to enable a fast preclinical drug
   screen.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a modular multifunctional nonviral gene delivery system by
   targeting the overexpressed cancer surface receptor alpha(5)beta(1)
   integrin and the upregulated transcriptional activity of the cancer
   resistance mediating transcription factor NF-kappa B, thereby
   introducing a new form of transcriptional targeting. NF-kappa B
   regulated therapy can improve specificity of gene expression in cancer
   tissue and also may offset NF-kappa B mediated cancer resistance. We
   delivered a luciferase gene under the control of an NF-kappa B
   responsive element (pNF-kappa B-Luc) encapsulated in a PR\_b peptide
   functionalized stealth liposome that specifically targets the
   alpha(5)beta(1), integrin and achieved increased gene expression in
   DLD-1 colorectal cancer cells compared to BJ-fibroblast healthy cells in
   vitro. The multitargeted system was also able to differentiate between
   cancer cells and healthy cells better than either of the individually
   targeted systems. In addition, we constructed a novel cancer therapeutic
   plasmid by cloning a highly potent diphtheria toxin fragment A (DTA)
   expressing gene under the control of an NF-kappa B responsive element
   (pNF-kappa B-DTA). A dose-dependent reduction of cellular protein
   expression and increased cytotoxicity in cancer cells was seen when
   transfected with PR\_b functionalized stealth liposomes encapsulating
   the condensed pNF-kappa B-DTA plasmid. Our therapeutic delivery system
   specifically eradicated close to 70\% of a variety of cancer cells while
   minimally affecting healthy cells in vitro. Furthermore, the modular
   nature of the nonviral design allows targeting novel pairs of
   extracellular receptors and upregulated transcription factors for
   applications beyond cancer gene therapy.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{5-6}},
Pages = {{1665-1670}},

Abstract = {{Until now, climate model intercomparison has focused primarily on annual
   and global averages of various quantities or on specific components, not
   on how well the general dynamics in the models compare to each other. In
   order to address how well models agree when it comes to the dynamics
   they generate, we have adopted a new approach based on climate networks.
   We have considered 28 pre-industrial control runs as well as 70
   20th-century forced runs from 23 climate models and have constructed
   networks for the 500 hPa, surface air temperature (SAT), sea level
   pressure (SLP), and precipitation fields for each run. We then employed
   a widely used algorithm to derive the community structure in these
   networks. Communities separate ``nodes{''} in the network sharing
   similar dynamics. It has been shown that these communities, or
   sub-systems, in the climate system are associated with major climate
   modes and physics of the atmosphere (Tsonis AA, Swanson KL, Wang G, J
   Clim 21: 2990-3001 in 2008; Tsonis AA, Wang G, Swanson KL, Rodrigues F,
   da Fontura Costa L, Clim Dyn, 37: 933-940 in 2011; Steinhaeuser K,
   Ganguly AR, Chawla NV, Clim Dyn 39: 889-895 in 2012). Once the community
   structure for all runs is derived, we use a pattern matching statistic
   to obtain a measure of how well any two models agree with each other. We
   find that, with the possible exception of the 500 hPa field, consistency
   for the SAT, SLP, and precipitation fields is questionable. More
   importantly, none of the models comes close to the community structure
   of the actual observations (reality). This is a significant finding
   especially for the temperature and precipitation fields, as these are
   the fields widely used to produce future projections in time and in
   space.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of lossless compression of binary trees, with
   the aim of reducing the number of code bits needed to store or transmit
   such trees. A lossless grammar-based code is presented, which encodes
   each binary tree into a binary codeword in two steps. In the first step,
   the tree is transformed into a context-free grammar from which the tree
   can be reconstructed. In the second step, the context-free grammar is
   encoded into a binary codeword. The decoder of the grammar-based code
   decodes the original tree from its codeword by reversing the two
   encoding steps. It is shown that the resulting grammar-based binary tree
   compression code is a universal code on a family of probabilistic binary
   tree source models satisfying certain weak restrictions.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, there has been extensive research on sparse
   representation of vector-valued signals. In the matrix case, the data
   points are merely vectorized and treated as vectors thereafter (for
   example, image patches). However, this approach cannot be used for all
   matrices, as it may destroy the inherent structure of the data.
   Symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices constitute one such class of
   signals, where their implicit structure of positive eigenvalues is lost
   upon vectorization. This paper proposes a novel sparse coding technique
   for positive definite matrices, which respects the structure of the
   Riemannian manifold and preserves the positivity of their eigenvalues,
   without resorting to vectorization. Synthetic and real-world computer
   vision experiments with region covariance descriptors demonstrate the
   need for and the applicability of the new sparse coding model. This work
   serves to bridge the gap between the sparse modeling paradigm and the
   space of positive definite matrices.}},

   the feasibility of using autologous blood outgrowth endothelial cells to

   Decellularized grafts pre-seeded with blood outgrowth endothelial cells
   (n = 3) retained unprecedented (> 95 \%) monolayer coverage 1 h
   post-implantation and had greater endothelial coverage, smaller wall
   thickness, and more basement membrane after 9-week implantation,
   including a final week without anti-coagulation therapy, compared with
   contralateral non-seeded controls. These results support the use of

Abstract = {{Background: Validated methods of objective assessments of surgical
   skills are resource intensive. We sought to test a web-based grading
   tool using crowdsourcing called Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical
   Skill.
   Materials and methods: Institutional Review Board approval was granted
   to test the accuracy of Amazon.com's Mechanical Turk and Facebook
   crowdworkers compared with experienced surgical faculty grading a
   recorded dry-laboratory robotic surgical suturing performance using
   three performance domains from a validated assessment tool. Assessor
   free-text comments describing their rating rationale were used to
   explore a relationship between the language used by the crowd and
   grading accuracy.
   Results: Of a total possible global performance score of 3-15, 10
   experienced surgeons graded the suturing video at a mean score of 12.11
   (95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 11.11 -13.11). Mechanical Turk and
   Facebook graders rated the video at mean scores of 12.21 (95\% CI,
   11.98-12.43) and 12.06 (95\% CI, 11.57-12.55), respectively. It took 24
   h to obtain responses from 501 Mechanical Turk subjects, whereas it took
   24 d for 10 faculty surgeons to complete the 3-min survey. Facebook
   subjects (110) responded within 25 d. Language analysis indicated that
   crowdworkers who used negation words (i.e., ``but,{''} `` although,{''}
   and so forth) scored the performance more equivalently to experienced
   surgeons than crowdworkers who did not (P < 0.00001).
   Conclusions: For a robotic suturing performance, we have shown that
   surgery-naive crowdworkers can rapidly assess skill equivalent to
   experienced faculty surgeons using Crowd-Sourced Assessment of Technical
   Skill. It remains to be seen whether crowds can discriminate different
   levels of skill and can accurately assess human surgery performances.

Abstract = {{Naturally occurring phytoestrogens may mimic biogenic estrogens and
   modulate endocrine action in vertebrates. Little is known, however,
   about their temporal and spatial variability in the environment and the
   biological effects associated with exposures. The present study assessed
   the environmental presence of phytoestrogens in human-impacted and
   relatively pristine areas. The response in larval and sexually mature
   fathead minnows to environmentally relevant concentrations of 3 common
   phytoestrogens (genistein, daidzein, and formononetin), both singly and
   in mixture, was also quantified. Phytoestrogens were only present in the
   human-impacted surface waters. When detected, mean concentrations were
   low (+/- standard deviation) in an urban lake: 1.4 +/- 0.5 ng/L, 1.6 +/-
   0.7 ng/L, and 1.1 +/- 0.2 ng/L for genistein, daidzein, and
   formononetin, respectively, and in treated wastewater effluent: 1.6 +/-
   0.4 ng/L, 1.8 +/- 1.3 ng/L, and 2.0 ng/L. Biochanin A was detected
   twice, whereas zearalenone and coumestrol were never detected. No clear
   temporal trends of aqueous phytoestrogen concentration were evident.
   Larval survival was significantly reduced in genistein, formononetin,
   and mixture treatments, whereas adult male fish only exhibited subtle
   changes to their anatomy, physiology, and behavior. Daidzein-exposed
   adult females produced greater quantities of eggs. The present study
   indicates that genistein, daidzein, and formononetin are likely
   attenuated rapidly and are unlikely to cause widespread ecological harm
   in the absence of other stressors. Environ Toxicol Chem 2014;33:553-559.

Abstract = {{Phytoestrogens are endocrine active compounds derived from plants,
   including the isoflavones genistein and daidzein, and their methylated
   derivatives biochanin A and formononetin. These compounds have been
   detected at the mu g/L level in the effluents of plant-processing
   industries and municipal treatment plants and at the ng/L level in
   surface waters worldwide. The present study assessed the persistence of
   genistein and daidzein in natural aquatic systems, specifically riverine
   samples. Initial concentration, temperature, sample location, and time
   of sample collection varied. Genistein and daidzein were found to be
   readily biodegradable at all tested concentrations, at both 10 degrees C
   and 20 degrees C, in samples collected during different seasons, and in
   samples from 3 different rivers. In addition, organismal responses in
   larval and sexually mature fathead minnows (Pimephales promelas) were
   quantified following exposure to microbiologically degraded
   phytoestrogens (genistein, daidzein, and formononetin). Products of the
   microbiological degradation of parent phytoestrogens did not affect
   larval survival, growth, or predator avoidance. Female adult fathead
   minnows exposed to these degradation products produced significantly
   fewer eggs than those exposed to a control, but no other morphological,
   physiological, or behavioral changes were observed with male or female
   minnows. The present research suggests that although phytoestrogens are
   not likely to persist in aquatic systems, they may pseudo-persist if
   discharges are continuous; in addition, caution should be exercised with
   respect to high-concentration effluents because of the potentially
   antiestrogenic effects of phytoestrogen degradates. Environ Toxicol Chem

Abstract = {{In tissue engineering, the evaluation of the host response to the
   biomaterial implantation must be assessed to determine the extent of the
   inflammatory reaction. We studied the degradation of poly(butylene
   succinate) and chitosan in vitro using lipase and lysozyme enzymes,
   respectively. The subcutaneous implantation of the scaffolds was
   performed to assess tissue response. The type of inflammatory cells
   present in the surrounding tissue, as well as within the scaffold, was
   determined histologically and by immunohistochemistry. In the presence
   of lipase or lysozyme, the water uptake of the scaffolds increased.
   Based on the weight loss data and scanning electron microscopy analysis,
   the lysozyme combined with lipase had a notable effect on the in vitro
   degradation of the scaffolds. The in vivo implantation showed a normal
   inflammatory response, with presence of neutrophils, in a first stage,
   and macrophages, lymphocytes, and giant cells in a later stage.
   Vascularization in the surrounding tissue and within the implant
   increased with time. Moreover, the collagen deposition increased with
   time inside the implant. In vivo, the scaffolds maintained the
   structural integrity. The degradation in vitro was faster and greater
   compared to that observed in vivo within the same time periods.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the application of topological sensitivity (TS)
   toward reconstructing and identifying tissue anomalies from magnetic
   resonance elastography (MRE) measurements. The basic idea of MRE imaging
   is to apply time-harmonic vibration to a tissue inside the magnetic
   resonance (MR) scanner and to capture the induced three-dimensional
   motion response (i.e., wave patterns) via suitable sequencing of the
   phase-coordinated, freeze-frame MR scans. To account for the facts that
   (1) the displacement of a material point captured by the MRE signifies
   the volume average over a reference voxel size, and (2) any given
   measurement voxel may contain, at least partially, the lesion of
   interest, the concept of TS is extended to allow for (1) averaged
   volumetric measurements and (2) overlapping interrogation and
   measurement domains. To circumvent the difficulties involved in the
   numerical modeling of an entire organ, the latter is subdivided into an
   array of cubic subdomains, each consisting of N3 voxels and playing the
   role of the reference body for TS imaging. To accomplish the sought
   uncoupling, the triaxial displacements along the boundary of each
   subdomain (captured by the MRE) are deployed as the Dirichlet data, thus
   specifying a separate boundary value problem, whereas the internal
   measurements within the subdomain are taken as the observations for
   lesion reconstruction. The performance of the proposed methodology for
   lesion reconstruction and material characterization is examined via both
   numerical examples and a preliminary application to in vivo MRE data.
   The sensitivity of the technique to measurement errors is investigated
   by introducing random noise to synthetic observations. The results
   highlight the potential of the TS method toward elevating the resolution
   of tissue (visco)elasticity reconstruction by MR imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) system is used to amplify the product
   gene to multiple copies in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells for
   generating cell lines which produce the recombinant protein at high
   levels. The physiological changes accompanying the transformation of the
   non-protein secreting host cells to a high producing cell line is not
   well characterized. We performed transcriptome analysis on CHO cells
   undergoing the selection and amplification processes. A host CHO cell
   line was transfected with a vector containing genes encoding the mouse
   DHFR (mDHFR) and a recombinant human IgG (hIgG). Clones were isolated
   following selection and subcloned following amplification. Control cells
   were transfected with a control plasmid which did not have the hIgG
   genes. Although methotrexate (MTX) amplification increased the
   transcript level of the mDHFR gene significantly, its effect on both
   hIgG heavy and light chain genes was more modest. The subclones appeared
   to retain the transcriptome signatures of their parental clones,
   however, their productivity varied among those derived from the same
   clone. The transcript levels of hIgG transgenes of all subclones fall in
   a narrower range than the product titer, alluding to the role of many
   functional attributes, other than transgene transcript, on productivity.
   We cross examined functional class enrichment during selection and
   amplification as well as between high and low producers and discerned
   common features among them. We hypothesize that the role of
   amplification is not merely increasing transcript levels, but also
   enriching survivors which have developed the cellular machinery for
   secreting proteins, leading to an increased frequency of isolating
   high-producing clones. We put forward the possibility of assembling a
   hyper-productivity gene set through comparative transcriptome analysis
   of a wide range of samples. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2014;111: 518-528. (c)

Abstract = {{The self-assembly between graphene oxide sheets and resol-type phenolic
   prepolymers was investigated as a method to form three-dimensional
   porous carbon objects with high surface areas and low densities. After
   freeze-drying and subsequent pyrolysis of the assembled hydrogels,
   ultralight graphene/carbon composite aerogels with high surface areas
   and porosity, good conductivity, and well-defined bulk shape were
   obtained. By adjusting the amount of graphene oxide and resol in the
   precursor mixture, aerogels with a density as low as 3.2 mg/cm(3) or a
   surface area as high as 1019 m(2)/g could be prepared. It is proposed
   that resol molecules are first adsorbed on the surface of graphene oxide
   sheets, and then the surface-coated sheets are crosslinked by the
   polymerization of resol prepolymers. The absorption performance was
   evaluated for the aerogel with the lowest density. Due to the high
   porosity, the aerogel displayed fast absorption rates for organic
   solvents as well as high absorption efficiencies. The high conductivity
   of the aerogels permits good performance as binderless monolithic
   electrodes for supercapacitors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The method of conditional moments is generalized to include evaluation
   of the effective elastic properties of particulate nanomaterials and to
   investigate the size effect in those materials. Determining the
   effective constants necessitates finding a stochastically averaged
   solution to the fundamental equations of linear elasticity coupled with
   surface/interface conditions (Gurtin-Murdoch model). To obtain such a
   solution the system of governing stochastic differential equations is
   first transformed to an equivalent system of stochastic integral
   equations. Using statistical averaging, the boundary-value problem is
   then converted to an infinite system of linear algebraic equations. A
   two-point approximation is considered and the stress fluctuations within
   the inclusions are neglected in order to obtain a finite system of
   algebraic equations in terms of component-average strains. Closed-form
   expressions are derived for the effective moduli of a composite
   consisting of a matrix and randomly distributed spherical
   inhomogeneities. As a numerical example a nanoporous material is
   investigated assuming a model in which the interface effects influence
   only the bulk modulus of the material. In that model the resulting shear
   modulus is the same as for the material without surface effects.
   Dependence of the bulk moduli on the radius of nanopores and on the pore
   volume fraction is analyzed. The results are compared to, and discussed
   in the context of other theoretical predictions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Compartment syndrome is a major concern in cases of extremity trauma,
   which occur in over 70\% of military combat casualty. Without treatment,
   compartment syndrome can lead to paralysis, loss of limb, or death. This
   paper focuses on the development of a handheld sensor that can be used
   for the noninvasive diagnosis of compartment syndrome. Analytical
   development of the sensing principle is first presented in which a
   relation is obtained between the pressure in a fluid compartment and the
   stiffness experienced by a handheld probe pushing on the compartment.
   Then a handheld sensor that can measure stiffness of an object without
   requiring the use of any inertial reference is presented. The handheld
   sensor consists of an array of three miniature force-sensing spring
   loaded pistons placed together on a probe. The center spring is chosen
   to be significantly stiffer than the side springs. The ratio of forces
   between the stiff and soft springs is proportional to the stiffness of
   the soft object against which the probe is pushed. Small
   millimeter-sized magnets on the pistons and magnetic field measurement
   chips are used to measure the forces in the individual pistons.
   Experimental results are presented using both an in vitro pneumatic test
   rig and a compliant agarose gel chamber that replicates a fluid pressure
   compartment. The sensor is shown to measure pressure accurately with a
   resolution of 0.1 psi over the range 0.75-2.5 psi. The developed sensor
   has the potential to be useful for convenient handheld diagnosis of
   compartment syndrome in traumatic extremity injuries.}},

Title = {{A Head and Neck Support Device for Inducing Local Hypothermia}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL DEVICES-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The present work describes the design of a device/system intended to
   induce local mild hypothermia by simultaneously cooling a patient's head
   and neck. The therapeutic goal is to lower the head and neck
   temperatures to 33-35 degrees C, while leaving the core body temperature
   unchanged. The device works by circulating a cold fluid around the
   exterior of the head and neck. The head surface area is separated into
   five different cooling zones. Each zone has a cooling coil and can be
   independently controlled. The cooling coils are tightly wrapped
   concentric circles of tubing. This design allows for a dense packing of
   tubes in a limited space, while preventing crimping of the tubing and
   minimizing the fluid pressure head loss. The design in the neck region
   also has multiple tubes wrapping around the circumference of the
   patient's neck in a helix. Preliminary testing indicates that this
   approach is capable of achieving the design goal of cooling the brain
   tissue (at a depth of 2.5 cm from the scalp) to 35 degrees C within
   30-40 min, without any pharmacologic or circulatory manipulation. In a
   comparison with examples of current technology, the device has shown the
   potential for improved cooling capability.}},

Journal = {{MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{The shell-like nano-structures (SLSs) own special ability to manipulate
   electromagnetic waves, and can be used as three-dimensional (3D)
   nano-antenna, highly efficient generator of second harmonic light,
   chiral metamaterials, and so on. However, to achieve this complicated
   geometry shape still remains challenging, which limits the related
   applications. In this paper, we propose a new method based on the
   microsphere self-assembly technology (MAT) to fabricate this type
   nano-structures, which is the use of basic SLSs (such as nano-cups or
   fragmented shells) as building blocks (BBs) to construct desired SLSs,
   just like that in architecture. Through establishing and using the
   related 3D geometric model, we design a great many of new SLSs, include
   some interesting structures, such as T-shape, `maple leaf-shape, and
   boat-shape structures. In theory, the number is infinite. In experiment,
   some new SLSs have been achieved, and their geometrical morphologies
   agree well with the designed. These new SLSs will provide a foundation
   for the related researches and applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   droplets}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{120}},
Pages = {{22-29}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Experiments were conducted to examine the combustion characteristics of
   refined, bleached and deodorized soybean oil and butanol blends. Single
   droplets were suspended on microfibers in a combustion chamber at
   atmospheric pressure and ignited with a hot wire. Ignition
   characteristics and burning behaviors including burning to completion,
   burning with microexplosion and incomplete combustion were analyzed for
   initial concentrations ranging from 25-75\% butanol. Droplet size and
   temperature measurements were analyzed throughout the droplet lifetimes.
   Relative concentrations prior and during combustion were estimated.
   Temperature measurements at ignition and during combustion were
   analyzed. The addition of butanol significantly lowered the ignition
   temperature. All mixtures studied ignited similarly to pure butanol
   droplets. The results were consistent with closed-cup flashpoint
   temperatures of butanol-soybean oil blends. A three-staged burn
   including a microexplosion was observed for all mixed droplets. Burning
   characteristics suggest a diffusion limited gasification mechanism,
   which has been previously linked to bi-component droplets with high
   volatility differentials. Microexplosions occur as a result of the more
   volatile component trapped within the droplet superheating at flame
   shrinkage. As butanol decreased to near equi-volume concentrations the
   microexplosions occurred earlier in the combustion process leading to
   higher concentrations of butanol trapped within the droplet at flame
   shrinkage. Therefore, equi-volume mixtures exhibited microexplosions
   with the greatest intensity. Blends of near equal concentrations by
   volume proved to exhibit the most favorable combustion characteristics.
   Bu40 exhibited the most violent microexplosions of all mixtures studied.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a wireless chemical sensor based on a
   magnetically functionalized hydrogels (ferrogels). By embedding
   superparamagnetic nanoparticles into the hydrogel network and laminating
   the hydrogel on a planar coil, the swelling state of the hydrogel, which
   depends on the chemical environment, can be interrogated by measuring
   its magnetic permeability. To validate the chemical sensing principle, a
   pH sensor is fabricated using a poly(methacrylic acid-co-acrylamide) pH
   sensitive hydrogel, and repeatable, reversible responses are obtained to
   pH changes, which are easily discriminated down to 0.1 pH unit. It is
   anticipated that the same scheme can be applied to hydrogels sensitive
   to different stimuli (e. g., glucose, specific ions, antigens,
   temperature, etc.), and that this sensor can be configured for
   implantation and wireless monitoring. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{A Stochastic Hybrid Systems framework for analysis of Markov reward

Journal = {{RELIABILITY ENGINEERING \& SYSTEM SAFETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{123}},
Pages = {{158-170}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a framework to analyze Markov reward models,
   which are commonly used in system performability analysis. The framework
   builds on a set of analytical tools developed for a class of stochastic
   processes referred to as Stochastic Hybrid Systems (SHS). The state
   space of an SHS is comprised of: (i) a discrete state that describes the
   possible configurations/modes that a system can adopt, which includes
   the nominal (non-faulty) operational mode, but also those operational
   modes that arise due to component faults, and (ii) a continuous state
   that describes the reward. Discrete state transitions are stochastic,
   and governed by transition rates that are (in general) a function of
   time and the value of the continuous state. The evolution of the
   continuous state is described by a stochastic differential equation and
   reward measures are defined as functions of the continuous state.
   Additionally, each transition is associated with a reset map that
   defines the mapping between the pre- and post-transition values of the
   discrete and continuous states; these mappings enable the definition of
   impulses and losses in the reward. The proposed SHS-based framework
   unifies the analysis of a variety of previously studied reward models.
   We illustrate the application Of the framework to performability
   analysis via analytical and numerical examples. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{CuInS2 thin films with thickness ranging from 196 to 1000 nm were
   prepared from a source containing CuInS2 nanocrystals by using thermal
   evaporation method. Annealed films of CuInS2 show the quasi-amorphous to
   crystalline phase transition, probed through x-ray diffraction (XRD),
   UV-visible spectrometer, and Raman spectroscopy. From XRD, the
   tetragonal distortion (eta) is found to be approximate to 1, confirming
   the arrangement of an extended double lattice structure of chalcopyrite
   phase. The surface morphology of quasi-amorphous film exhibits a very
   smooth surface, whereas crystalline film shows a very rough surface of
   CuInS2 as observed from atomic force microscopy. Crystallite size and
   rms roughness increase from 23 to 310 nm and from 1.5 to 36.5,
   respectively, with increasing film thickness as well as with increasing
   annealing temperature due to the crystallization process. Micro-Raman
   study evidencing the presence of a strong Raman A(1) mode at 303 cm(-1),
   due to the symmetric vibration of anion sublattice of CuInS2 structure.
   A fundamental band edge is observed in as-deposited quasi-amorphous
   CuInS2 films, while bulk energy band absorption and excitonic band
   transition are observed in crystalline films. A sharp drop in both
   reflectance and transmittance near the energy band gap region is
   observed in thick films due to a very strong absorption of crystalline
   phase of CuInS2.}},

Title = {{Interplay between chain stiffness and excluded volume of semiflexible
   polymers confined in nanochannels}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 28}},
Abstract = {{The properties of channel-confined semiflexible polymers are determined
   by a complicated interplay of chain stiffness and excluded volume
   effects. Using Pruned-Enriched Rosenbluth Method (PERM) simulations, we
   study the equilibrium properties of channel-confined polymers by
   systematically controlling chain stiffness and excluded volume. Our
   calculations of chain extension and confinement free energy for freely
   jointed chains with and without excluded volume show excellent agreement
   with theoretical predictions. For ideal wormlike chains, the extension
   is seen to crossover from Odijk behavior in strong confinement to
   zero-stretching, bulk-like behavior in weak confinement. In contrast,
   for self-avoiding wormlike chains, we always observe that the linear
   scaling of the extension with the contour length is valid in the
   long-chain limit irrespective of the regime of confinement, owing to the
   coexistence of stiffness and excluded volume effects. We further propose
   that the long-chain limit for the extension corresponds to chain lengths
   wherein the projection of the end-to-end distance along the axis of the
   channel is nearly equal to the mean span parallel to the axis. For DNA
   in nanochannels, this limit was identified using PERM simulations out to
   molecular weights of more than 1 megabase pairs; the molecular weight of
   lambda-DNA is found to exhibit nearly asymptotic fractional extension
   for channels sizes used commonly in experiments. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{A series of poly(cyclohexylethylene)-block-poly(methyl methacrylate)
   (PCHE-PMMA) diblock copolymers with varying molar mass (4.9 kg/mol <=
   M-n <= 30.6 kg/mol) and narrow molar mass distribution were synthesized
   through a combination of anionic and atom transfer radical
   polymerization (ATRP) techniques. Heterogeneous catalytic hydrogenation
   of alpha-(hydroxy)polystyrene (PS-OH) yielded
   alpha-(hydroxy)poly(cyclohexylethylene) (PCHE-OH) with little loss of
   hydroxyl functionality. PCHE-OH was reacted with alpha-bromoisobutyryl
   bromide (BiBB) to produce an ATRP macroinitiator used for the
   polymerization of methyl methacrylate. PCHE-PMMA is a glassy, thermally
   stable material with a large effective segment-segment interaction
   parameter, chi(eff) = (144.4 +/- 6.2)/T - (0.162 +/- 0.013), determined
   by mean-field analysis of order-to-disorder transition temperatures
   (T-ODT) measured by dynamic mechanical analysis and differential
   scanning calorimetry. Ordered lamellar domain pitches (9 <= D <= 33 nm)
   were identified by small-angle X-ray scattering from neat BCPs
   containing 43-52 vol \% PCHE (f(PCHE)). Atomic force microscopy was used
   to show similar to 7.5 nm lamellar features (D = 14.8 nm) which are some
   of the smallest observed to date. The lowest molar mass sample (M-n =
   4.9 kg/mol, f(PCHE) = 0.46) is characterized by T-ODT = 173 +/- 3
   degrees C and sub-5 nm nanodomains, which together with the sacrificial
   properties of PMMA and the high overall thermal stability place this
   material at the forefront of ``high-chi{''} systems for advanced
   nanopatterning applications.}},

Abstract = {{Block copolymers are attractive building blocks for designing micelles
   having complex shapes and functionality, but experimental investigations
   into the detailed thermodynamics of block copolymer micellization have
   been constrained. In this work, we take advantage of the favorable
   solvent properties of ionic liquids to study the thermodynamics of block
   copolymer micelle formation. Specifically, we investigate the effects of
   solvent quality and degree of polymerization on the critical micelle
   temperature (cmt) of poly(ethylene oxide-b-n-butyl methacrylate)
   (PEO-b-PnBMA) in mixtures of two ionic liquids:
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium:bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
   ({[}BMIm]{[}TFSI]) and 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium:TFSI
   ({[}EMIm]{[}TFSI]). The solvent quality for the core-forming block of
   the block copolymer, PnBMA, is varied over a wide range by blending the
   two ionic liquids in different ratios, resulting in a large variation in
   the cmt of PEO-b-PnBMA. It is shown that the interaction parameter
   between the solvent and PnBMA at the cmt is approximately constant for
   all of the ionic liquid mixtures. The enthalpies and entropies of
   micelle formation also do not vary with ionic liquid composition,
   suggesting that the nature of the polymer/solvent and solvent/solvent
   interactions do not change much as the ionic liquid composition is
   varied despite the large change in solvent quality. Furthermore, the cmt
   is shown to depend on the degree of polymerization of PnBMA as predicted
   by theory.}},

Abstract = {{By controlling stoichiometry via a hybrid molecular beam epitaxy
   approach, we report on the study of thin film growth and the electronic
   transport properties of phase-pure, epitaxial NdTiO3/SrTiO3
   heterostructures grown on (001) (La0.3Sr0.7)(Al0.65Ta0.35)O-3 (LSAT)
   substrates as a function of cation stoichiometry in NdTiO3. Despite the
   symmetry mismatch between bulk NdTiO3 and the substrate, NdTiO3 films
   grew in an atomic layer-by-layer fashion over a range of cation
   stoichiometry; however amorphous films resulted in cases of extreme
   cation non-stoichiometry. Temperature-dependent sheet resistance
   measurements were consistent with Fermi-liquid metallic behavior over a
   wide temperature range, but revealed a remarkable crossover from
   metal-to-insulator (M-I) type behavior at low temperatures for all
   compositions. A direct correlation between cation stoichiometry,
   transport behavior, and the temperature of M-I transition is
   established. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{While the formation of nanoparticles in nonthermal plasmas is well
   known, the heating mechanism leading to their crystallization is poorly
   understood. In this study, we investigate the crystallization of
   amorphous silicon nanoparticles in nonthermal plasmas using a tandem
   plasma configuration. Amorphous silicon nanoparticles with diameters of
   3, 4 or 5 nm are formed in a low-power nonthermal upstream plasma, and
   injected directly into a second separate downstream plasma.
   Crystallization of the amorphous silicon nanoparticles is investigated
   as a function of the power used to maintain the second plasma. This
   approach allows for the decoupling of nanoparticle synthesis and
   heating. The nanoparticle properties and plasma conditions are examined
   to obtain a comprehensive understanding of nanoparticle heating and
   crystallization. The particle crystallinity was studied using x-ray
   diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy.
   We discovered a threshold power for complete crystallization of the
   particles. A combination of comprehensive plasma characterization with a
   nanoparticle heating model reveals the underlying plasma physics leading
   to crystallization. Here we found that the nanoparticles reach
   temperatures as high as 750-850 K in the secondary plasma, which is well
   above the gas temperature and sufficient for complete nanoparticle
   crystallization. While we demonstrate this method of predicting
   nanoparticle temperature using silicon, the approach can be applied
   broadly to other plasma-synthesized nanomaterials.}},

Abstract = {{Rivers in watersheds dominated by agriculture throughout the US are
   impaired by excess sediment, a significant portion of which comes from
   non-field, near-channel sources. Both land-use and climate have been
   implicated in altering river flows and thereby increasing stream-channel
   erosion and sediment loading. In the wetland-rich landscapes of the
   upper Mississippi basin, 20th century crop conversions have led to an
   intensification of artificial drainage, which is now a critical
   component of modern agriculture. At the same time, much of the region
   has experienced increased annual rainfall. Uncertainty in separating
   these drivers of streamflow fuels debate between agricultural and
   environmental interests on responsibility and solutions for excess
   riverine sediment. To disentangle the effects of climate and land-use,
   we compared changes in precipitation, crop conversions, and extent of
   drained depressional area in 21 Minnesota watersheds over the past 70
   years. Watersheds with large land-use changes had increases in seasonal
   and annual water yields of >50\% since 1940. On average, changes in
   precipitation and crop evapotranspiration explained less than one-half
   of the increase, with the remainder highly correlated with artificial
   drainage and loss of depressional areas. Rivers with increased flow have
   experienced channel widening of 10-40\% highlighting a source of
   sediment seldom addressed by agricultural best management practices.

Abstract = {{Block polymers are ideally suited for polymer electrolytes exhibiting
   both high ionic conductivity and superior mechanical robustness because
   they self-assemble into well-defined nanostructures. Network
   morphologies exhibiting long-range continuity of both the mechanically
   robust and conductive domains maximize the macroscopic composite
   properties but are difficult to achieve in commonly studied diblock
   copolymer systems. We therefore investigated a polymer electrolyte
   comprising the triblock terpolymer
   poly{[}isoprene-b-(styrene-co-norbornenylethylstyrene)-b-ethyl-ene
   oxide] (INSO) and the ionic liquid 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (EMITFSI) because INSO self-assembles
   into equilibrium network morphologies in which each domain is continuous
   throughout the sample. Small-angle X-ray scattering and transmission
   electron microscopy revealed the bulk morphology of INSO to be the O-70
   network prior to cross-linking. The material remained
   microphase-separated but without long-range order after solvent-casting
   from dichloromethane, a morphology that was retained after cross-linking
   and the addition of ionic liquid. Cross-linking had the effect of
   increasing the elastic modulus by 4 orders of magnitude, from 10(4) to
   10(8) Pa, and importantly, a high modulus was retained well above the
   T-g of linear polystyrene. The conductivity was somewhat lower than that
   expected for a heterogeneous electrolyte, but the results suggest that
   refinements to the solvent-casting procedure could increase connectivity
   of the conductive domain and thus macroscopic conductivity.}},

Abstract = {{Fitting potential energy surfaces to analytic forms is an important
   first step for efficient molecular dynamics simulations. Here, we
   present an improved version of the local interpolating moving least
   squares method (L-IMLS) for such fitting. Our method has three key
   improvements. First, pairwise interactions are modeled separately from
   many-body interactions. Second, permutational invariance is incorporated
   in the basis functions, using permutationally invariant polynomials in
   Morse variables, and in the weight functions. Third, computational cost
   is reduced by statistical localization, in which we statistically
   correlate the cutoff radius with data point density. We motivate our
   discussion in this paper with a review of global and local
   least-squares-based fitting methods in one dimension. Then, we develop
   our method in six dimensions, and we note that it allows the analytic
   evaluation of gradients, a feature that is important for molecular
   dynamics. The approach, which we call statistically localized,
   permutationally invariant, local interpolating moving least squares
   fitting of the many-body potential (SL-PI-L-IMLS-MP, or, more simply,
   L-IMLS-G2), is used to fit a potential energy surface to an electronic
   structure dataset for N-4. We discuss its performance on the dataset and
   give directions for further research, including applications to
   trajectory calculations. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Interfaces between organic semiconductors and dielectrics may exhibit
   interfacial electronic polarization, which is equivalently quantified as
   a contact potential difference (CPD), an interface dipole, or a vacuum
   level shift. Here we report quantitative measurements by scanning Kelvin
   probe microscopy (SKPM) of surface potentials and CPDs across ultrathin
   (1-2 monolayer) crystalline islands of the benchmark semiconductor
   pentacene thermally deposited on a variety of polymer dielectrics (e.g.,
   poly(methyl methacrylate), polystyrene). The CPDs between the pentacene
   islands and the polymer substrates are in the range of -10 to +50 mV,
   they depend strongly on the polymer type and deposition temperature, and
   the CPD magnitude is correlated with the dipole moment of the
   characteristic monomers. Surface potential variations within 2 monolayer
   (3 nm) thick pentacene islands are similar to 15 mV and may be ascribed
   to microstructure (epitaxial) differences. Overall, the microscopy
   results reveal both strong variations in interfacial polarization and
   lateral electrostatic heterogeneity; these factors ultimately should
   affect the performance of these interfaces in devices.}},

Abstract = {{We use a hybrid strategy to obtain anharmonic frequency shifts and
   lifetimes of phonon quasiparticles from first principles molecular
   dynamics simulations in modest size supercells. This approach is
   effective irrespective of crystal structure complexity and facilitates
   calculation of full anharmonic phonon dispersions, as long as phonon
   quasiparticles are well defined. We validate this approach to obtain
   anharmonic effects with calculations in MgSiO3 perovskite, the major
   Earth forming mineral phase. First, we reproduce irregular thermal
   frequency shifts of well characterized Raman modes. Second, we combine
   the phonon gas model (PGM) with quasiparticle frequencies and reproduce
   free energies obtained using thermodynamic integration. Combining
   thoroughly sampled quasiparticle dispersions with the PGM we then obtain
   first-principles anharmonic free energy in the thermodynamic limit (N ->
   infinity).}},

Abstract = {{It is important to understand the differences between emissions from
   standard laboratory testing cycles and those from actual on-road driving
   conditions, especially for solid particle number (SPN) emissions now
   being regulated in Europe. This study compared particle mass and SPN
   emissions from a heavy-duty diesel vehicle operating over the urban
   dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS) and actual on-road driving
   conditions. Particle mass emissions were calculated using the integrated
   particle size distribution (IPSD) method and called M-IPSD. The M-IPSD,
   emissions for the UDDS and on-road tests were more than 6 times lower
   than the U.S. 2007 heavy-duty particulate matter (PM) mass standard. The
   M-IPSD emissions for the UDDS fell between those for the on-road uphill
   and downhill driving. SPN and M-IPSD measurements were dominated by
   nucleation particles for the UDDS and uphill driving and by accumulation
   mode particles for cruise and downhill driving. The SPN emissions were
   similar to 3 times lower than the Euro 6 heavy-duty SPN limit for the
   UDDS and downhill driving and similar to 4-5 times higher than the Euro
   6 SPN limit for the more aggressive uphill driving; however, it is
   likely that most of the ``solid{''} particles measured under these
   conditions were associated with a combination release of stored sulfates
   and enhanced sulfate formation associated with high exhaust
   temperatures, leading to growth of volatile particles into the solid
   particle counting range above 23 nm. Except for these conditions, a
   linear relationship was found between SPN and accumulation mode M-IPSD.
   The coefficient of variation (Coy) of SPN emissions of particles >23 nm
   ranged from 8 to 26\% for the UDDS and on-road tests.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the problem of spatiotemporal bed topography
   evolution and sediment transport estimation in rivers with migrating bed
   forms of different types and sizes, in statistical equilibrium
   conditions. Instead of resorting to bed form classification, we propose
   to evaluate the evolution of multiscale bed topography as the integral
   of unit contributions defined through a spacetime Fourier decomposition
   of bed elevations. Using joint 2D spectra in the frequency and wave
   number domain, a functional relationship between the length scales and
   the timescales in which migrating bed forms are decomposed is proposed
   and developed into a dimensionless expression for scaledependent
   convection velocities. This formulation highlights the violation of
   Taylor's hypothesis for migrating bed forms, confirming statistically
   that larger bed forms travel slower as compared to smaller bed forms.
   This phenomenological description leads to a spectral extension of the
   Simons et al. (1965) formula for sediment transport to incorporate a
   range of multiscale migrating features. Both the scaling of convection
   velocities and the spectral estimate of sediment transport rate were
   validated through extensive bed elevation data from laboratory
   experiments conducted at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory, for a range
   of Froude numbers 0.2<Fr<0.5, under varying discharge and bed material
   composition.

Abstract = {{Integration of wastewater treatment with algae cultivation is one of the
   promising ways to achieve an economically viable and environmentally
   sustainable algal biofuel production on a commercial scale. This study
   focused on pilot-scale algal biomass production system development,
   cultivation process optimization, and integration with swine manure
   wastewater treatment. The areal algal biomass productivity for the
   cultivation system that we developed ranged from 8.08 to 14.59 and
   19.15-23.19 g/m(2)xday, based on ash-free dry weight and total suspended
   solid (TSS), respectively, which were higher than or comparable with
   those in literature. The harvested algal biomass had lipid content about
   1.77-3.55 \%, which was relatively low, but could be converted to
   bio-oil via fast microwave-assisted pyrolysis system developed in our
   lab. The lipids in the harvested algal biomass had a significantly
   higher percentage of total unsaturated fatty acids than those grown in
   lab conditions, which may be attributed to the observed temperature and
   light fluctuations. The nutrient removal rate was highly correlated to
   the biomass productivity. The NH3-N, TN, COD, and PO4-P reduction rates
   for the north-located photo-bioreactor (PBR-N) in July were 2.65, 3.19,
   7.21, and 0.067 g/m(2)xday, respectively, which were higher than those
   in other studies. The cultivation system had advantages of high
   mixotrophic growth rate, low operating cost, as well as reduced land
   footprint due to the stacked-tray bioreactor design used in the study.}},

Abstract = {{The microreactor has been developed for a wide range of applications
   because of many advantages, such as high mass transfer efficiency, low
   energy consumption and the closed and safe system. The application of
   microreactors in the traditional hydrometallurgy extraction process is
   expected to overcome difficulties such as co-extraction of impurities,
   large consumption of extractant and hidden fire risks. In this study,
   the extraction and separation efficiency of In3+ from a complex sulfate
   solution containing impurities, such as Fe2+ and Zn2+, were studied. The
   microreactor extraction was carried out in a Pyrex microchip, and the
   organic phase was prepared with the extractant di(2-ethylhexyl)
   phosphoric acid (D2EHPA) diluted in 260\# kerosene. The results showed
   that with only 0.55 s contact between the organic and aqueous phases,
   the extraction ratio of In3+ can reach 90.80\%, while only 0.16\% of
   Fe2+ and 0.22\% of Zn2+ were co-extracted; the average mass transfer
   speed of In3+ was calculated as high as 0.34 g.m(-2).s(-1). Compared
   with the traditional mixing settler process, microreactor extraction has
   advantages of higher extraction ratio of In3+, lower trend of
   co-extraction of the impurities and emulsification.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-element volume radio-frequency (RF) coils are an integral aspect
   of the growing field of high-field magnetic resonance imaging. In these
   systems, a popular volume coil of choice has become the transverse
   electromagnetic (TEM) transceiver coil consisting of microstrip
   resonators. In this paper, to further advance this design approach, a
   new microstrip resonator strategy in which the transmission line is
   segmented into alternating impedance sections, referred to as stepped
   impedance resonators (SIRs), is investigated. Single-element simulation
   results in free space and in a phantom at 7 T (298 MHz) demonstrate the
   rationale and feasibility of the SIR design strategy. Simulation and
   image results at 7 T in a phantom and human head illustrate the
   improvements in a transmit magnetic field, as well as RF efficiency
   (transmit magnetic field versus specific absorption rate) when two
   different SIR designs are incorporated in 8-element volume coil
   configurations and compared to a volume coil consisting of microstrip
   elements.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{The conceptual design of an innovative seismic-resistant steel framing
   system capable of providing stiffness and ductility to new or existing
   structures is presented. The bracing system consists of concentric
   X-braces connected in series with rectangular sacrificial shear panels.
   The braces are designed to remain elastic during seismic events while
   the shear panels are sized and configured to dissipate ample energy
   through plastic deformation-induced stable hysteretic behavior. Detailed
   three-dimensional nonlinear finite-element analyses using ABAQUS are
   performed to characterize and quantify the effects of the design
   parameters on the local response of the bracing system and to adjust the
   design so that potential buckling of the elements is mitigated. The
   finite element predicted force-displacement curves of bracing systems
   that achieve the desired local behavior when subjected to a specified
   interstory drift are in turn translated into a SAP2000 nonlinear link
   element. Embedment of the link element in a two-dimensional steel frame
   model enables the assessment of the performance of the bracing system as
   applied to a seven-story steel frame subjected to different intensity
   levels of seismic excitation. The results demonstrate that the braced
   ductile shear panel framing system offers promise for decreasing the
   lateral displacements of structures subjected to earthquakes while
   minimizing damage to all structural elements other than the sacrificial
   panels.}},

Abstract = {{Alloyed silicon-germanium (SiGe) nanostructures are the topic of renewed
   research due to applications in modern optoelectronics and
   high-temperature thermoelectric materials. However, common techniques
   for producing nanostructured SiGe focus on bulk processing; therefore
   little is known of the physical properties of SiGe nanocrystals (NCs)
   synthesized from molecular precursors. In this letter, we synthesize and
   deposit thin films of doped SiGe NCs using a single, flow-through
   nonthermal plasma reactor and inertial impaction. Using x-ray and
   vibrational analysis, we show that the SiGe NC structure appears truly
   alloyed for Si1-xGex for 0.16 < x < 0.24, and quantify the atomic dopant
   incorporation within the SiGe NC films. (C) 2014 Author(s).}},

Abstract = {{Ascending thoracic aortic aneurysms (ATAA) have a high propensity for
   dissection, which occurs when the hemodynamic load exceeds the
   mechanical strength of the aortic media. Despite our recognition of this
   essential fact, the complex architecture of the media has made a
   predictive model of medial failure-even in the relatively simple case of
   the healthy vessel-difficult to achieve. As a first step towards a
   general model of ATAA failure, we characterized the mechanical behavior
   of healthy ascending thoracic aorta (ATA) media using uniaxial
   stretch-to-failure in both circumferential (n = 11) and axial (n = 11)
   orientations and equibiaxial extensions (n = 9). Both experiments
   demonstrated anisotropy, with higher tensile strength in the
   circumferential direction (2510 +/- 439.3 kPa) compared to the axial
   direction (750 +/- 102.6 kPa) for the uniaxial tests, and a ratio of
   1.44 between the peak circumferential and axial loads in equibiaxial
   extension. Uniaxial tests for both orientations showed macroscopic
   tissue failure at a stretch of 1.9. A multiscale computational model,
   consisting of a realistically aligned interconnected fiber network in
   parallel with a neo-Hookean solid, was used to describe the data;
   failure was modeled at the fiber level, with an individual fiber failing
   when stretched beyond a critical threshold. The best-fit model results
   were within the 95\% confidence intervals for uniaxial and biaxial
   experiments, including both prefailure and failure, and were consistent
   with properties of the components of the ATA media.}},

Number = {{2-3, SI}},
Pages = {{405-411}},

Abstract = {{Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that DNA electrophoresis in
   a hexagonal array of micron-sized posts changes qualitatively when the
   applied electric field vector is not coincident with the lattice vectors
   of the array. DNA electrophoresis in such tilted post arrays is superior
   to the standard un-tilted approach; while the time required to achieve a
   resolution of unity in a tilted post array is similar to an un-tilted
   array at a low-electric field strengths, this time (i) decreases
   exponentially with electric field strength in a tilted array and (ii)
   increases exponentially with electric field strength in an un-tilted
   array. Although the DNA dynamics in a post array are complicated, the
   electrophoretic mobility results indicate that the free path, i.e. the
   average distance of ballistic trajectories of point-sized particles
   launched from random positions in the unit cell until they intersect the
   next post, is a useful proxy for the detailed DNA trajectories. The
   analysis of the free path reveals a fundamental connection between
   anisotropy of the medium and DNA transport therein that goes beyond
   simply improving the separation device.}},

Title = {{Quantitative PCR for measuring biomass of decomposer fungi in planta}},
Journal = {{FUNGAL ECOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{39-46}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The biomass of brown and white rot fungi were estimated using ergosterol
   and quantitative PCR (qPCR). Each biomass estimate was compared with
   biomass measured gravimetrically from liquid cultures, as well as from
   three wood substrata at two decay stages. Fungal morphological changes
   in two different substrata, agar and pine, were measured using a
   chitin-specific fluorophore and confocal microscopy. In liquid culture,
   the two fungal isolates had significantly different biomass conversion
   factors for both methods. In wood colonized for 3 wks, qPCR yielded a
   lower estimate than did ergosterol, while at week 8 it yielded a higher
   estimate. Changes in average fungal cell dimensions partially explained
   differences between the two methods. Overall, our results suggest that a
   constant conversion factor cannot be assumed as default for either
   method. Instead, it demonstrates the importance of standardizing wood
   species, decay class, fungus-specific conversion factor, and DNA
   extraction protocol in order to properly estimate fungal biomass in
   woody substrata. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd and The British Mycological

Abstract = {{Recently, a low-latency decoding scheme called the simplified successive
   cancellation (SSC) algorithm has been proposed for polar codes. In this
   brief, we present the first systematic approach to formally derive the
   SSC decoding latency for any given polar code. The method to derive the
   SSC polar decoder architecture for any specific code is also presented.
   Moreover, the architecture of the precomputation SSC polar decoder is
   also proposed, which can further reduce the decoding latency. Compared
   with their SC decoder counterparts, the proposed SSC and precomputation
   SSC polar decoders can save up to 39.6\% decoding latency with the same
   hardware cost.}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) represents an effective means for
   capturing the essential features of numerically or experimentally
   generated flow fields. In order to achieve a desirable tradeoff between
   the quality of approximation and the number of modes that are used to
   approximate the given fields, we develop a sparsity-promoting variant of
   the standard DMD algorithm. Sparsity is induced by regularizing the
   least-squares deviation between the matrix of snapshots and the linear
   combination of DMD modes with an additional term that penalizes the
   l(1)-norm of the vector of DMD amplitudes. The globally optimal solution
   of the resulting regularized convex optimization problem is computed
   using the alternating direction method of multipliers, an algorithm
   well-suited for large problems. Several examples of flow fields
   resulting from numerical simulations and physical experiments are used
   to illustrate the effectiveness of the developed method. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{On the homogenization of turbulent flow structures in the wake of a
   model wind turbine}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The structure of flow turbulence, measured experimentally, in the wake
   of a model wind turbine is investigated here through higher order
   scale-dependent statistics of the velocity increments and compared to
   the smooth wall turbulent boundary layer (base flow) case. The wind
   turbine wake flow is observed to possess higher turbulent kinetic
   energy, when compared to the base flow, though it contains more
   homogenized scale-dependent velocity increments, as confirmed via
   magnitude cumulant analysis of the streamwise velocities. Along with a
   reduction in intermittency (a measure of inhomogeneity) in the wake of
   the wind turbine, the asymmetry of the probability density functions of
   the velocity increments is also observed to be reduced. This is
   interpreted in terms of scale decoupling mechanisms and attenuating
   interactions and non-local energy transfer. In other words, wind
   turbines reduce the intermittency and asymmetry in the wake flow by
   breaking and/or deflecting the large-scale flow structures of the
   incoming flow, thus rendering the structure of the velocity fluctuations
   more homogenized as compared to the base flow. Experiments were
   conducted in a large scale, boundary layer wind tunnel at the St.
   Anthony Falls Laboratory. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Large-eddy simulation of offshore wind farm}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{A hybrid numerical capability is developed for the simulation of
   offshore wind farms, in which large-eddy simulation is performed for the
   wind turbulence, and a potential flow based method is used for the
   simulation of the ocean wave field. The wind and wave simulations are
   dynamically coupled. The effect of wind turbines on the wind field is
   represented by an actuator disk model. This study focuses on the effect
   of wind-seas, and the turbine motion is treated as negligibly small. A
   variety of fully-developed and fetch-limited wind-sea conditions and
   turbine spacings are considered in the study. Statistical analyses are
   performed for the simulation results, with a focus on the mean wind
   profile, kinetic energy budget in the wind field, and the wind turbine
   power extraction rate. The results indicate that the waves have
   appreciable effect on the wind farm performance. The wind turbines
   obtain a higher wind power extraction rate under the fully developed
   wind-sea condition compared with that under the fetch-limited condition.
   This higher extraction rate is caused by the faster propagating waves
   and the lower sea-surface resistance on the wind when the wind-seas are
   fully developed. The wave-induced difference can be as high as 8\% with
   the commonly used turbine spacing in commercial land-based wind farms,
   s(x) = 7 (with s(x) being the ratio of streamwise turbine spacing to the
   turbine diameter). Such level of difference is noteworthy considering
   the previous understanding that direct wave-induced disturbance to the
   wind field decays exponentially away from wave surface. (C) 2014 AIP

Title = {{X-ray structure, thermodynamics, elastic properties and MD simulations

Journal = {{CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS OF LIPIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{178}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Cardiolipins (CLs) are important biologically for their unique role in
   biomembranes that couple phosphorylation and electron transport like
   bacterial plasma membranes, chromatophores, chloroplasts and
   mitochondria. CLs are often tightly coupled to proteins involved in
   oxidative phosphorylation. The first step in understanding the
   interaction of CL with proteins is to obtain the pure CL structure, and
   the structure of mixtures of CL with other lipids. In this work we use a
   variety of techniques to characterize the fluid phase structure,
   material properties and thermodynamics of mixtures of
   dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) with tetramyristoylcardiolipin
   (TMCL), both with 14-carbon chains, at several mole percentages. X-ray
   diffuse scattering was used to determine structure, including bilayer
   thickness and area/lipid, the bending modulus, K-C, and S-Xray, a
   measure of chain orientational order. Our results reveal that TMCL
   thickens DMPC bilayers at all mole percentages, with a total increase of
   similar to 6 angstrom in pure TMCL, and increases A(L) from 64
   angstrom(2) (DMPC at 35 degrees C) to 109 angstrom(2) (TMCL at 50
   degrees C). IQ increases by similar to 50\%, indicating that TMCL
   stiffens DMPC membranes. TMCL also orders DMPC chains by a factor of
   similar to 2 for pure TMCL. Coarse grain molecular dynamics simulations
   confirm the experimental thickening of 2 angstrom for 20 mol\% TMCL and
   locate the TMCL headgroups near the glycerol-carbonyl region of DMPC;
   i.e., they are sequestered below the DMPC phosphocholine headgroup. Our
   results suggest that TMCL plays a role similar to cholesterol in that it
   thickens and stiffens DMPC membranes, orders chains, and is positioned
   under the umbrella of the PC headgroup. CL may be necessary for
   hydrophobic matching to inner mitochondrial membrane proteins.
   Differential scanning calorimetry, S-Xray and CGMD simulations all
   suggest that TMCL does not form domains within the DMPC bilayers. We
   also determined the gel phase structure of TMCL, which surprisingly
   displays diffuse X-ray scattering, like a fluid phase lipid. A(L) = 40.8
   angstrom(2) for the 1/2TMCL gel phase, smaller than the DMPC gel phase
   with A(L) = 47.2 angstrom(2), but similar to A(L) of DLPE = 41
   angstrom(2), consistent with untilted chains in gel phase TMCL. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{An automated method is presented to identify energetically feasible
   mechanisms of heterogeneous catalytic systems comprising of several
   thousand reactions and species. Specifically, it combines automated
   rule-based network generation of complex networks with semi-empirical
   estimation of thermochemical properties to (a) generate large reaction
   networks, (b) calculate thermochemistry and activation barriers of each
   step on-the-fly, and (c) identify energetically feasible pathways and
   mechanisms to experimentally observed products. This method is applied
   to analyze the mechanism of glycerol conversion on transition metal
   catalysts for which a network of 3300 reactions and 500 species was
   generated. Using (i) group additivity methods for calculating reaction
   and species energies, (ii) linear free energy relationships for
   activation barriers, and (Hi) linear scaling relationships for
   comparative assessment of energetics of species on different transition
   metals, the energetically feasible pathways for forming C-C scission and
   C-O scission products (syngas and propane diol, respectively) are
   identified on platinum, palladium, rhodium, and ruthenium catalysts. Our
   results indicate that (a) C-C scission products are preferred on
   platinum and palladium, (b) rhodium and ruthenium will have a
   comparatively higher selectivity for C-O scission products, and (c)
   glycerol tends to undergo several dehydrogenation steps prior to
   undergoing C-C scission, which are all consistent with experimental
   observations and DFT calculations. We propose that this method can be
   used to screen a large number of pathways in complex catalytic networks
   and to thereby identify the dominant modes in the system, because it is
   fast and scalable in handling larger networks, flexible in accommodating
   different types of semi-empirical correlations, and generic in handling
   any catalytic chemistry.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the growth of thin films of yttrium iron garnet (YIG) on

   grow due to either cracking or incomplete crystallization of the films.
   We have established the proper growth parameters by tuning seed layer
   thickness to an optimum of 45 nm. These films were then used as seed
   layers for growth of films of Bi:YIG and Ce:YIG. Bi:YIG films show a
   Faraday rotation of 1700 degrees/cm, and Ce:YIG films show a Faraday
   rotation of 3700 degrees/cm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the use of magnetoresistive and sonar sensors for
   imminent collision detection in cars. The magnetoresistive sensors are
   used to measure the magnetic field from another vehicle in close
   proximity, to estimate relative position, velocity, and orientation of
   the vehicle from the measurements. First, an analytical formulation is
   developed for the planar variation of the magnetic field from a car as a
   function of 2-D position and orientation. While this relationship can be
   used to estimate position and orientation, a challenge is posed by the
   fact that the parameters in the analytical function vary with the type
   and model of the encountered car. Since the type of vehicle encountered
   is not known a priori, the parameters in the magnetic field function are
   unknown. The use of both sonar and magnetoresistive sensors and an
   adaptive estimator is shown to address this problem. While the sonar
   sensors do not work at very small intervehicle distance and have low
   refresh rates, their use during a short initial time duration leads to a
   reliable estimator. Experimental results are presented for both a
   laboratory wheeled car door and for a full-scale passenger sedan. The
   results show that planar position and orientation can be accurately
   estimated for a range of relative motions at different oblique angles.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study estimator inconsistency in vision-aided inertial
   navigation systems (VINS) from the standpoint of system's observability.
   We postulate that a leading cause of inconsistency is the gain of
   spurious information along unobservable directions, which results in
   smaller uncertainties, larger estimation errors, and divergence. We
   develop an observability constrained VINS (OC-VINS), which explicitly
   enforces the unobservable directions of the system, hence preventing
   spurious information gain and reducing inconsistency. This framework is
   applicable to several variants of the VINS problem such as visual
   simultaneous localization and mapping (V-SLAM), as well as
   visual-inertial odometry using the multi-state constraint Kalman filter
   (MSC-KF). Our analysis, along with the proposed method to reduce
   inconsistency, are extensively validated with simulation trials and

Title = {{Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction for high-resolution
   bioimepedance imaging through vector source reconstruction under the
   static field of MRI magnet}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is
   an imaging modality to reconstruct the electrical conductivity of
   biological tissue based on the acoustic measurements of Lorentz force
   induced tissue vibration. This study presents the feasibility of the
   authors' new MAT-MI system and vector source imaging algorithm to
   perform a complete reconstruction of the conductivity distribution of
   real biological tissues with ultrasound spatial resolution.
   Methods: In the present study, using ultrasound beamformation, imaging
   point spread functions are designed to reconstruct the induced vector
   source in the object which is used to estimate the object conductivity
   distribution. Both numerical studies and phantom experiments are
   performed to demonstrate the merits of the proposed method. Also,
   through the numerical simulations, the full width half maximum of the
   imaging point spread function is calculated to estimate of the spatial
   resolution. The tissue phantom experiments are performed with a MAT-MI
   imaging system in the static field of a 9.4 T magnetic resonance imaging
   magnet.
   Results: The image reconstruction through vector beamformation in the
   numerical and experimental studies gives a reliable estimate of the
   conductivity distribution in the object with a similar to 1.5 mm spatial
   resolution corresponding to the imaging system frequency of 500 kHz
   ultrasound. In addition, the experiment results suggest that MAT-MI
   under high static magnetic field environment is able to reconstruct
   images of tissue-mimicking gel phantoms and real tissue samples with
   reliable conductivity contrast.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate that MAT-MI is able to image the
   electrical conductivity properties of biological tissues with better
   than 2 mm spatial resolution at 500 kHz, and the imaging with MAT-MI
   under a high static magnetic field environment is able to provide
   improved imaging contrast for biological tissue conductivity
   reconstruction. (C) 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

   hyperdynamics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICS AND PHYSICS OF SOLIDS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{63}},
Pages = {{94-112}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The quasicontinuum (QC) method is a spatial multiscale method that
   extends the length scales accessible to fully atomistic simulations
   (like molecular dynamics (MD)) by several orders of magnitude. While the
   recent development of the so-called ``hot-QC method{''} enables dynamic
   simulations at finite temperature, the times accessible to these
   simulations remain limited to the sub-microsecond time scale due to the
   small time step required for stability of the numerical integration. To
   address this limitation, we develop a novel finite-temperature QC method
   that can treat much longer time scales by coupling the hot-QC method
   with hyperdynamics a method for accelerating time in MD simulations. We
   refer to the new approach as ``hyper-QC{''}. As in the original
   hyperdynamics method, hyper-QC is targeted at dynamical systems that
   exhibit a separation of time scales between short atomic vibration
   periods and long waiting times in metastable states. Acceleration is
   achieved by modifying the hot-QC potential energy to reduce the energy
   barriers between metastable states in a manner that ensures that the
   characteristic dynamics of the system are preserved. First, the high
   accuracy of hot-QC in reproducing rare event kinetics is demonstrated.
   Then, the hyper-QC methodology is validated by comparing hyper-QC
   results with those of hot-QC and full MD for a one-dimensional chain of
   atoms interacting via a Lennard-Jones potential. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Journal = {{PROGRESS IN AEROSPACE SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{1-21}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems commonly encountered in
   engineering and biological applications involve geometrically complex
   flexible or rigid bodies undergoing large deformations. Immersed
   boundary (IB) methods have emerged as a powerful simulation tool for
   tackling such flows due to their inherent ability to handle arbitrarily
   complex bodies without the need for expensive and cumbersome dynamic
   re-meshing strategies. Depending on the approach such methods adopt to
   satisfy boundary conditions on solid surfaces they can be broadly
   classified as diffused and sharp interface methods. In this review, we
   present an overview of the fundamentals of both classes of methods with
   emphasis on solution algorithms for simulating FSI problems. We
   summarize and juxtapose different IB approaches for imposing boundary
   conditions, efficient iterative algorithms for solving the
   incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of dynamic
   immersed boundaries, and strong and loose coupling FSI strategies. We
   also present recent results from the application of such methods to
   study a wide range of problems, including vortex-induced vibrations,
   aquatic swimming, insect flying, human walking and renewable energy.
   Limitations of such methods and the need for future research to mitigate
   them are also discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Microalgae are viewed as a potential future agricultural and biofuel
   feedstock and also provide an ideal biological means of carbon
   sequestration based on rapid growth rates and high biomass yields. Any
   potential improvement using high-yield microalgae to fix carbon will
   require additional fertilizer inputs to provide the necessary nitrogen
   required for protein and nucleotide biosynthesis. The free-living
   diazotroph Azotobacter vinelandii can fix nitrogen under aerobic
   conditions in the presence of reduced carbon sources such as sucrose or
   glycerol and is also known to produce a variety of siderophores to
   scavenge different metals from the environment. In this study, we
   identified two strains of green algae, Neochloris oleoabundans and
   Scenedesmus sp. BA032, that are able to utilize the A.vinelandii
   siderophore azotobactin as a source of nitrogen to support growth. When
   grown in a co-culture, S. sp. BA032 and N.oleoabundans obtained the
   nitrogen required for growth through the association with A.vinelandii.
   These results, indicating a commensalistic relationship, provide a proof
   of concept for developing a mutualistic or symbiotic relationship
   between these two species using siderophores as a nitrogen shuttle and
   might further indicate an additional fate of siderophores in the
   environment.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the feasibility of using high-intensity
   focused ultrasound (HIFU), under dual-mode ultrasound arrays (DMUAs)
   guidance, to induce localized thermal damage inside ovaries without
   damage to the ovarian surface.
   Design: Laboratory feasibility study.
   Setting: University-based laboratory.
   Animal(s): Ex vivo canine and bovine ovaries.
   Intervention(s): DMUA-guided HIFU.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Detection of ovarian damage by ultrasound
   imaging, gross pathology, and histology.
   Result(s): It is feasible to induce localized thermal damage inside
   ovaries without damage to the ovarian surface. DMUA provided sensitive
   imaging feedback regarding the anatomy of the treated ovaries and the
   ablation process. Different ablation protocols were tested, and thermal
   damage within the treated ovaries was histologically characterized.
   Conclusion(s): The absence of damage to the ovarian surface may
   eliminate many of the complications linked to current laparoscopic
   ovarian drilling (LOD) techniques. HIFU may be used as a less traumatic
   tool to perform LOD. (C) 2014 by American Society for Reproductive

Title = {{Novel Firmicutes Group Implicated in the Dechlorination of Two

Volume = {{80}},

Abstract = {{Although the abundance and diversity of natural organochlorines are well
   established, much is still unknown about the degradation of these
   compounds. Triplicate microcosms were used to determine whether, and
   which, bacterial communities could dechlorinate two chlorinated
   xanthones (2,7-dichloroxanthone and
   5,7-dichloro-1,3-dihydroxylxanthone), analogues of a diverse class of
   natural organochlorines. According to quantitative-PCR (qPCR) results,
   several known dechlorinating genera were either not present or not
   enriched during dechlorination of the xanthones. Denaturing gradient gel
   electrophoresis, however, indicated that several Firmicutes were
   enriched in the dechlorinating cultures compared to triplicate controls
   amended with nonchlorinated xanthones. One such group, herein referred
   to as the Gopher group, was further studied with a novel qPCR method
   that confirmed enrichment of Gopher group 16S rRNA genes in the
   dechlorinating cultures. The enrichment of the Gopher group was again
   tested with two new sets of triplicate microcosms. Enrichment was
   observed during chlorinated xanthone dechlorination in one set of these
   triplicate microcosms. In the other set, two microcosms showed clear
   enrichment while a third did not. The Gopher group is a previously
   unidentified group of Firmicutes, distinct from but related to the
   Dehalobacter and Desulfitobacterium genera; this group also contains
   clones from at least four unique cultures capable of dechlorinating
   anthropogenic organochlorines that have been previously described in the
   literature. This study suggests that natural chlorinated xanthones may
   be effective biostimulants to enhance the remediation of pollutants and
   highlights the idea that novel genera of dechlorinators likely exist and
   may be active in bioremediation and the natural cycling of chlorine.}},

Abstract = {{In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the
   impulse noise causes catastrophic accuracy degradation since the impulse
   noise affects all the subcarriers in a symbol due to the fast Fourier
   transform (FFT) operations at the receiver. Potential causes of impulse
   noise include erasure channel, power switching, and circuit failure in
   integrated circuits. In this paper, from a practical observation, a
   novel iterative impulse error correction scheme is proposed. This scheme
   is referred to as the impulse noise location and value search algorithm,
   which is based on the crucial observation of the relationship of the
   impulse noise and the symbol constellation. In a 512-FFT OFDM system at
   25 dB additive white Gaussian noise signal-to-noise ratio, for
   quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM)-4 and QAM-8 modulation, simulation
   results show that our proposed novel scheme can effectively correct
   impulse errors that corrupt up to 20.7 \% and 13.9 \% of the received
   time-domain signal at known locations. In addition, without the
   knowledge of impulse noise location, the proposed scheme still can
   correct at least 9.96 \% of the received time-domain signal for QAM-4
   modulation.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental and well-studied problem in computational geometry is
   range searching, where the goal is to preprocess a set, S, of geometric
   objects (e.g., points in the plane) so that the subset S' c S that is
   contained in a query range (e.g., an axes-parallel rectangle) can be
   reported efficiently. However, in many situations, what is of interest
   is to generate a more informative ``summary{''} of the output, obtained
   by applying a suitable aggregation function on S'. Examples of such
   aggregation functions include count, sum, min, max, mean, median, mode,
   and top-k that are usually computed on a set of weights defined suitably
   on the objects. Such range-aggregate query problems have been the
   subject of much recent research in both the database and the
   computational geometry communities.
   In this paper, we further generalize this line of work by considering
   aggregation functions on point-sets that measure the extent or
   ``spread{''} of the objects in the retrieved set S'. The functions
   considered here include closest pair, diameter, and width. The challenge
   here is that these aggregation functions (unlike, say, count) are not
   efficiently decomposable in the sense that the answer to S' cannot be
   inferred easily from answers to subsets that induce a partition of S'.
   Nevertheless, we have been able to obtain space- and
   query-time-efficient solutions to several such problems including:
   closest pair queries with axes-parallel rectangles on point sets in the
   plane and on random point-sets in R-d (d >= 2), closest pair queries
   with disks on random point-sets in the plane, diameter queries on
   point-sets in the plane, and guaranteed-quality approximations for
   diameter and width queries in the plane. Our results are based on a
   combination of geometric techniques, including multilevel range trees,
   Voronoi Diagrams, Euclidean Minimum Spanning Trees, sparse
   representations of candidate outputs, and proofs of (expected) upper
   bounds on the sizes of such representations. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{The use of concentrated solar radiation as the source of process heat to
   drive biomass gasification offers potential increases in yield and
   efficiency over conventional approaches to gasification but requires
   that temporal variations in output be alleviated with thermal storage or
   hybridization. The impacts of thermal storage and degree of
   hybridization on the efficiency, specific yield, and variation in output
   of a solar gasification facility are explored through parametric
   simulations of a generalized 100 MW (th) solar receiver facility.
   Nominal syngas yield rates from 1.5 to 50 tonnes/h are considered along
   with molten carbonate salt storage volumes from 200 to 6500 m(3). High
   solar fractions (95\%) result in a maximum thermal efficiency of 79\%
   and specific syngas yield of 139 GJ/ha while low solar fractions (10\%)
   for highly hybridized facilities reduce the thermal efficiency to 72\%
   and specific yield to 88 GJ/ha, akin to conventional gasification
   processes. Solar fractions greater than 95\% result in large variation
   in synthesis gas yield rate, varying as much as 30: 1 throughout the
   year. This variation can be reduced to below a 4: 1 ratio, more
   acceptable for downstream processes, through either hybridization to
   achieve solar fractions less than 50\% with little to no thermal
   storage, or alternately the use of 5600 m(3) of molten carbonate salt to
   allow for solar fractions up to 87\%.}},

Title = {{Microscale measurements reveal contrasting effects of photosynthesis and
   epiphytes on frictional drag on the surfaces of filamentous algae}},
Journal = {{FRESHWATER BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{312-324}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{1. Filamentous algae are widespread in freshwater ecosystems worldwide
   with a significant presence in streams, rivers and lakes with sufficient
   light and nutrients. Although typically not a preferred food source for
   grazers, dense filamentous mats provide surfaces for epiphytic
   microorganisms that are more palatable, thus adding to stream
   productivity.
   2. We tested the hypothesis that epiphytes change velocity gradients,
   and consequently shear stress and skin friction drag, near the surface
   of algal filaments. Using both digital holography and particle image
   velocimetry to measure micrometre-scale velocity fields, we found that
   the surface shear stress on filamentous algae was much greater when the
   algae were actively photosynthesising. The presence of attached diatoms
   significantly reduced surface shear stress, while those filaments were
   photosynthesising, compared with bare filaments.
   3. A nutrient flux model, based on boundary layer thickness and surface
   shear stress, predicts that nutrient flux to the surface of a
   photosynthesising filament under measured flow conditions will be 1.5
   times greater than for a preserved (i.e. dead) filament. Modelled
   nutrient flux to filaments with epiphytic assemblages dominated by
   diatoms is 75\% of the flux to bare filaments under similar flow
   conditions.
   4. The proposed positive feedback between photosynthesis, surface shear
   stress and nutrient flux could be an important biophysical mechanism
   that overcomes diffusion limited nutrient supply within dense algal
   mats, enhancing algal survival through increased nutrient flux to
   actively photosynthesising filaments and decreased sloughing risk for
   filaments with lower rates of photosynthesis (due to epiphyte coverage
   or other light-limiting factors).}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a method to construct and query the spectrum
   (>15,000) of potential biomass-derived compounds that can be synthesized
   using heterogeneous catalysis. Specifically, it involves the
   construction of an exhaustive network of reactions using RING, a
   rule-based network generator that we have developed, to identify
   potentially synthesizable compounds from biomass. Subsequently, we: (a)
   employ quantitative structure-property relationships to query compounds
   with desired properties, (b) seek different synthesis routes to these
   compounds, and (c) evaluate these routes in terms of stoichiometric,
   energetics, and physical parameters such as atom efficiency, enthalpy
   and free energy change of reactions, and aqueous-organic partition
   coefficients (LogP) of intermediates. Thermochemistry and LogP are both
   estimated using group additivity methods, and all property estimations
   are performed on-the-fly during network generation. We present this
   method in context of identifying and evaluating heterogeneous catalytic
   routes from biomass to fatty alcohols that are potential constituents of
   nonionic surfactants. We also show that group additivity-based estimates
   of enthalpy of reaction are accurate to within 10 kJ/mol and Log P
   values reliably predict the relative hydrophobicity of compounds. This
   method is generic, flexible, reliable and fast in terms of the scope of
   chemistry that can be considered, properties that can be included,
   predictive accuracy, and speed of execution; it can, therefore, be used
   to rapidly screen a large spectrum of compounds and synthesis routes in
   biomass conversion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of flow velocity on the uptake of cadmium, copper, lead,
   and zinc by hydroponically grown soft stem bulrush (Scirpus validus) was
   investigated. The roots of the plants were exposed to a continually
   recycled, nutrient enriched, synthetic stormwater. Plants were divided
   into groups and the roots of each group exposed to different but
   constant water velocities. The metal concentrations in the roots and
   stems were compared after three weeks. Metal accumulation in roots was
   increased for water velocities between 1.3 and 4.0cm s(-1). In a second
   experiment, the roots of all plants were exposed to a single velocity
   and the root and stem metal concentrations were determined as a function
   of time. Metal concentrations in the roots approached a constant value
   after three weeks. After this time, accumulation of metals depends upon
   root growth. The results suggest that long-term accumulation by the
   roots of hydroponic Scirpus validus can be increased by increasing water
   velocity, which implies that floating islands with movement will retain
   more metals from the water column.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastomas (GBMs) are the most common and malignant primary brain
   tumors and are aggressively treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and
   radiotherapy. Despite this treatment, recurrence is inevitable and
   survival has improved minimally over the last 50 years. Recent studies
   have suggested that GBMs exhibit both heterogeneity and instability of
   differentiation states and varying sensitivities of these states to
   radiation. Here, we employed an iterative combined theoretical and
   experimental strategy that takes into account tumor cellular
   heterogeneity and dynamically acquired radioresistance to predict the
   effectiveness of different radiation schedules. Using this model, we
   identified two delivery schedules predicted to significantly improve
   efficacy by taking advantage of the dynamic instability of
   radioresistance. These schedules led to superior survival inmice. Our
   interdisciplinary approach may also be applicable to other human cancer
   types treated with radiotherapy and, hence, may lay the foundation for
   significantly increasing the effectiveness of a mainstay of oncologic
   therapy.}},

Title = {{SHEAR: sample heterogeneity estimation and assembly by reference}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{JAN 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Personal genome assembly is a critical process when studying
   tumor genomes and other highly divergent sequences. The accuracy of
   downstream analyses, such as RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, can be greatly
   enhanced by using personal genomic sequences rather than standard
   references. Unfortunately, reads sequenced from these types of samples
   often have a heterogeneous mix of various subpopulations with different
   variants, making assembly extremely difficult using existing assembly
   tools. To address these challenges, we developed SHEAR (Sample
   Heterogeneity Estimation and Assembly by Reference;
   http://vk.cs.umn.edu/SHEAR), a tool that predicts SVs, accounts for
   heterogeneous variants by estimating their representative percentages,
   and generates personal genomic sequences to be used for downstream
   analysis.
   Results: By making use of structural variant detection algorithms, SHEAR
   offers improved performance in the form of a stronger ability to handle
   difficult structural variant types and better computational efficiency.
   We compare against the lead competing approach using a variety of
   simulated scenarios as well as real tumor cell line data with known
   heterogeneous variants. SHEAR is shown to successfully estimate
   heterogeneity percentages in both cases, and demonstrates an improved
   efficiency and better ability to handle tandem duplications.
   Conclusion: SHEAR allows for accurate and efficient SV detection and
   personal genomic sequence generation. It is also able to account for
   heterogeneous sequencing samples, such as from tumor tissue, by
   estimating the subpopulation percentage for each heterogeneous variant.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{140}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JAN 28}},
Abstract = {{Consideration is given to several practical issues arising during the
   implementation of hyperdynamics, a methodology that extends the time
   scale of the conventional molecular dynamics simulation potentially by
   orders of magnitude. First, the methodology is reformulated in terms of
   the transition rate based on the buffer region approach (buffer rate),
   which can describe transitions in more general contexts than the
   transition state theory (TST). It will be shown that hyperdynamics can
   exactly preserve the buffer rate as well as the TST rate, which broadens
   the scope of the method. Next, the originally proposed scheme to compute
   the boost factor on-the-fly is reviewed and some alternative methods,
   one of which uses the umbrella sampling method, are presented. Finally,
   the methodology is validated in the context of a 1-dimensional example
   potential and a 3-dimensional simulation of the motion of an atomic
   force microscope tip moving along a surface. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing

Abstract = {{We present a detailed comparison of simulations of disordered melts of
   symmetric AB diblock copolymers to predictions of the renormalized
   one-loop (ROL) theory. The behaviors of the structure factor S(q) and of
   single-chain correlations are studied over a range of chain lengths (N =
   16, ..., 128) for two models: one with harshly repulsive pair
   interactions and another with very soft interactions. The ROL theory is
   shown to provide an excellent description of the dependence of S(q) on
   chain length and thermodynamic conditions for both models, even for very
   short chains, if we allow for the existence of a nonlinear dependence of
   the effective interaction parameter chi(e) upon the strength of the AB
   repulsion. The decrease in peak wavenumber q{*} with increasing chi(e)
   is shown to be unrelated to changes in single-chain correlations.
   Results for all quantities are consistent with the hypothesis that the
   ROL theory gives an exact description of the dominant O((N) over bar
   (-1/2)) corrections to RPA and random-walk predictions in the limit of
   infinite chain length N.}},

Abstract = {{The high-energy requirement to separate ethanol from fermentation broths
   by distillation is a major hurdle for the economical use of
   bio-renewable ethanol in a wide variety of chemical applications.
   Three-phase Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations have been employed to
   assess the performance of two promising alternatives: adsorptive
   separation using silicalite-1, a hydrophobic zeolite, and liquid-liquid
   extraction using two high-molecular-weight alcohols, namely decan-1-ol
   and decan-4-ol. These simulations show that in both separation processes
   the selectivity for ethanol over water is significantly higher at low
   concentrations though this trend is more pronounced in the zeolite
   system. The vapor-to-sorbent partition coefficient is significantly
   higher at low concentrations, while the organic solvent systems show
   only a weak dependence of the vapor-to-solvent partition coefficient on
   concentration. This behavior can be rationalized by the different
   ethanol/water aggregates (in terms of size and architecture) formed in
   these two environments. A key factor in these differences is the spatial
   confinement of the hydrogen-bonded aggregates by the alkyl tails of the
   solvent or by the rigid zeolite structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

   movement}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{272}},
Pages = {{150-159}},
Month = {{JAN 24}},
Abstract = {{Although behavioral deterrent systems, directed at exploiting fish
   sensory systems, are the common place in fisheries management, little is
   understood about the link between imposed sensory signals (e.g., sound
   intensity) and the resulting fish movements. Here, an
   advection-diffusion equation, incorporating a stimuli specific repulsive
   flux, is coupled with calculation of the generated stimulus field in
   order to model fish movement near a behavioral deterrent system. A
   stability analysis of this model is then used to determine the
   effectiveness of a deterrent stimulus to disrupt the natural movement of
   fish. Results of laboratory experiments of a bubble curtain to inhibit
   common carp, Cyprinus carpio, movement are used to develop the model and
   verify stability analysis predictions. This experimental data
   demonstrate that the acoustic stimulus (sound pressure levels) produced
   by bubble curtain systems can be sufficient to disrupt the natural
   movement of carp, i.e. inhibit fish passage. In addition, a sensitivity
   analysis is used to investigate how model stability is impacted by
   changes in movement behaviors (i.e. diffusion and advection rates). This
   coupling of a movement model and stability analysis could find general
   application in the assessment of behavioral deterrent systems, in
   particular at field sites where long term physical testing may be
   impractical. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   method for creating flexible substrates with embedded, printed silver
   lines. In a sequential process, aerosol-jet printed silver lines are

   the aerosol jet to print continuous lines on a low energy surface, a
   100\% transfer of the printed electrodes is obtained, as confirmed by
   electrical measurements. Moreover, the root-mean-square roughness of the
   embedded electrodes is less than 10 nm, which is much lower than that
   for their as-printed form. The embedded electrodes are robust and do not
   show a significant degradation in electrical performance after thousands

Title = {{Tracking target signal strengths on a grid using sparsity}},
Journal = {{EURASIP JOURNAL ON ADVANCES IN SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Multi-target tracking is mainly challenged by the nonlinearity present
   in the measurement equation and the difficulty in fast and accurate data
   association. To overcome these challenges, the present paper introduces
   a grid-based model in which the state captures target signal strengths
   on a known spatial grid (TSSG). This model leads to linear state and
   measurement equations, which bypass data association and can afford
   state estimation via sparsity-aware Kalman filtering (KF). Leveraging
   the grid-induced sparsity of the novel model, two types of
   sparsity-cognizant TSSG-KF trackers are developed: one effects sparsity
   through a{''}{''} (1)-norm regularization, and the other invokes
   sparsity as an extra measurement. Iterative extended KF and Gauss-Newton
   algorithms are developed for reduced-complexity tracking, along with
   accurate error covariance updates for assessing performance of the
   resultant sparsity-aware state estimators. Based on TSSG state
   estimates, more informative target position and track estimates can be
   obtained in a follow-up step, ensuring that track association and
   position estimation errors do not propagate back into TSSG state
   estimates. The novel TSSG trackers do not require knowing the number of
   targets or their signal strengths and exhibit considerably lower
   complexity than the benchmark hidden Markov model filter, especially for
   a large number of targets. Numerical simulations demonstrate that
   sparsity-cognizant trackers enjoy improved root-mean-square error
   performance at reduced complexity when compared to their
   sparsity-agnostic counterparts. Comparison with the recently developed
   additive likelihood moment filter reveals the better performance of the
   proposed TSSG tracker.}},

Abstract = {{The preparation of hierarchical zeolites usually involves hard or soft
   templates and multiple synthesis steps, which often prohibit their
   industrial uses. One way to overcome these issues is to build
   hierarchical zeolites using repetitive branching, where the intrinsic
   growth patterns of zeolites, instead of porogenic templates, are
   utilized. This paper expands on an earlier report to unravel the
   sequence of events leading to this repetitive branching process for the
   framework type MFI zeolite structure using small-angle X-ray scattering
   and transmission electron microscopy. Moreover, adsorption and transport
   properties of the hierarchical zeolite are probed using
   2,2-dimethylbutane, n-hexane, and n-nonane.}},

Abstract = {{The plant immune signaling network needs to be robust against attack
   from fast-evolving pathogens and tunable to optimize immune responses.
   We investigated the basis of robustness and tunability in the signaling
   network controlling pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) in Arabidopsis. A
   dynamic network model containing four major signaling sectors, the
   jasmonate, ethylene, phytoalexin-deficient 4, and salicylate sectors,
   which together govern up to 80\% of the PTI levels, was built using data
   for dynamic sector activities and PTI levels under exhaustive
   combinatorial sector perturbations. Our regularized multiple regression
   model had a high level of predictive power and captured known and
   unexpected signal flows in the network. The sole inhibitory sector in
   the model, the ethylene sector, contributed centrally to network
   robustness via its inhibition of the jasmonate sector. The model's
   multiple input sites linked specific signal input patterns varying in
   strength and timing to different network response patterns, indicating a
   mechanism enabling tunability.}},

Title = {{Modeling and numerical simulation of the forces acting on a sphere
   during early-water entry}},
Journal = {{OCEAN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{1-9}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{Mathematical modeling, absent simplifying assumptions and coupled with
   numerical simulation, has been implemented to determine the motions and
   forces experienced by a sphere penetrating a water surface from an air
   space above the surface. The model and simulation are validated by
   comparisons with extensive experimental data and with trends from
   approximate analyses. Although the present work adds to the
   understanding and quantification of the sphere as an entry object, its
   major contribution is model development and validation to enable
   investigation of water entry of objects of practical utility such as the
   expendable bathythermograph (XBT). The XBT device is widely used in the
   determination of temperature distributions in large water bodies such as
   oceans. The measured temperature distributions are, in turn, used to
   determine the thermal energy content of oceans. During the course of the
   numerical simulations, parametric variations were made of the sphere
   velocity, surface tension, flow regime (laminar or turbulent), and
   Reynolds number. The drag-coefficient results were found to be
   independent of these quantities. This outcome indicates that momentum
   transfer from the sphere to the adjacent liquid is responsible for the
   drag force and that friction is a secondary issue. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{The mechanism of secondary hardening in MP35N (Co-35Ni-20Cr-10Mo) alloy
   due to exposures at elevated temperatures has been studied. It was
   observed that short exposure to elevated temperatures increased the
   ultimate tensile strength and yield stress while decreasing the
   elongation of MP35N wires. Upon aging at temperatures from 300 to 900
   degrees C the elastic modulus increased although no changes in
   crystallographic orientation or microstructure were observed. The grain
   size and major texture components were unchanged following aging.
   Analytical scanning transmission electron microscope investigation
   showed that MP35N is hardened by preferential segregation of molybdenum
   to stacking faults and deformation twins. It also revealed that the
   concentration of molybdenum segregation was proportional to the amount
   of initial cold work before aging. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc.

Abstract = {{Stem cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells hold great potential for the
   treatment of liver disease and for drug toxicity screening. The success
   of these applications hinges on the generation of differentiated cells
   with high liver specific activities. Many protocols have been developed
   to guide human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) to differentiate to the
   hepatic lineage. Here we report cultivation of hESCs as
   three-dimensional aggregates that enhances their differentiation to
   hepatocyte-like cells. Differentiation was first carried out in
   monolayer culture for 20 days. Subsequently cells were allowed to
   self-aggregate into spheroids. Significantly higher expression of
   liver-specific transcripts and proteins, including Albumin,
   phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, and asialoglycoprotein receptor 1 was
   observed. The differentiated phenotype was sustained for more than 2
   weeks in the three-dimensional spheroid culture system, significantly
   longer than in monolayer culture. Cells in spheroids exhibit
   morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of primary hepatocytes
   by scanning and transmission electron microscopy in addition to mature
   functions, such as biliary excretion of metabolic products and
   cytochrome P450 activities. This three-dimensional spheroid culture
   system may be appropriate for generating high quality, functional
   hepatocyte-like cells from ESCs.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{184}},

Abstract = {{5-Hydroxymethyl furfural (HMF) production from fructose dehydration in
   DMSO with various catalytic systems has shown superior selectivity and
   high yields. Yet, the subsequent need for energy-intensive separation of
   HMF from HMF/fructose/DMSO mixtures challenges the practical feasibility
   of this process. Microporous carbon materials have shown promise as
   substrates for alternative adsorption-based separations, but the origin
   of HMF selectivity and adsorption capacity, and thereby
   structure-properties relations enabling rational design of enhanced
   sorbents, has remained elusive. Through systematic quantification of the
   functionality and texture of various commercial (BP2000, Norit1240) and
   synthetic carbons (three-dimensionally ordered macroporous carbons;
   mesoporous carbons), we link, for the first time, adsorption capacity
   and HMF adsorption selectivity to two tunable materials properties of
   the carbon sorbents: microporosity and oxygenate functionality (i.e.,
   carbon polarity). In the process, we exploit these newly elucidated
   structure-properties relations for realizing a class of synthetic
   carbons with sub-micron particulate morphology that achieve more than
   60\% higher selectivity and more than 20\% higher capacity for HMF over
   fructose as compared to the best performing commercial product, BP2000.

Volume = {{48}},

Abstract = {{Dissolved organic matter (DOM) represents the major pool of organic
   precursors for harmful disinfection byproducts, such as haloacetic acids
   (HAAs), formed during drinking water chlorination, but much of it
   remains molecularly uncharacterized. Knowledge of model precursors is
   thus a prerequisite for understanding the more complex whole water DOM.
   The utility of HAA formation potential data from model DOM precursors,
   however, is limited due to the lack of comparability to water samples.
   In this study, the formation kinetic S dichloroacetic. acid (DCAA) and
   trichloroacetic acid (TCAA), the two predominant HAA species, were
   delineated upon chlorination of seventeen,model DOM precursors and
   sixty-eight inland lake water samples collected from the Upper Midwest
   region of the United States. Of particular interest was the finding that
   the DCAA and TCAA formation rate constants could be grouped into four
   statistically distinct clusters reflecting the core structural features
   of model DOM precursors (i.e., non-beta-diketone aliphatics,
   beta-diketone aliphatics, non-beta-diketone phenolics, and beta-diketone
   phenolics). A comparative approach built upon hierarchical cluster
   analysis was developed to gain further insight into the chlorine
   reactivity patterns of HAA precursors in inland lake waters as defined
   by the relative proximity to four model precursor clusters. This work
   highlights the potential for implementing an integrated
   kinetic-clustering approach to constrain the chlorine reactivity of DOM
   in source waters.}},

Abstract = {{During the past two decades, noteworthy experimental investigations have
   been conducted on wave propagation in phononic crystals, with special
   emphasis on crystals for acoustic wave control, consisting of the
   repetition of cylindrical or spherical elements in a fluid medium. On
   the other hand, the experimental characterization of the elastic wave
   phenomena observed in the solid microstructure of phononic crystals
   designed for elastic wave control has been quite sparse and limited in
   scope. The related literature focuses mostly on steady-state analyses
   that aim at highlighting filtering properties, and are limited to
   out-of-plane measurements. The scope of this work is to address these
   limitations and provide a detailed experimental characterization of the
   transient wave phenomena observed in the cores of lattice-like phononic
   crystals. This is achieved using a 3D Scanning Laser Vibrometer, which
   allows measuring the in-plane velocity of material points belonging to
   the lattice topology. This approach is tested against the benchmark case
   of a regular honeycomb lattice. Specifically, the objective is to
   demonstrate the directional and dispersive nature of the S-mode at
   relatively low frequencies and characterize the P-mode below and above
   its veering frequency. The experimental results are compared against
   numerical simulations and unit cell Bloch analysis to highlight
   similarities and differences between the true response of finite
   crystals and the infinite lattice approximation. This study also intends
   to highlight the advantages of three-dimensional laser vibrometry as a
   tool for the characterization of complex structural materials, while
   carefully exposing some limitations of this methodology. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The aim of this review article is to assess the descriptive capabilities
   of the Hubbard-rooted LDA+U method and to clarify the conditions under

   the theoretical foundation of LDA+U and prototypical applications to the
   study of correlated materials, discusses the most relevant
   approximations used in its formulation, and makes a comparison with
   other approaches also developed for similar purposes. Open issues of the
   method are also discussed, including the calculation of the electronic
   couplings (the Hubbard U), the precise expression of the corrective
   functional and the possibility to use LDA+U for other classes of
   materials. The second part of the article presents recent extensions to
   the method and illustrates the significant improvements they have
   obtained in the description of several classes of different systems. The
   conclusive section finally discusses possible future developments of
   LDA+U to further enlarge its predictive power and its range of

Abstract = {{We describe the performance of a drift tube-ion mobility spectrometry
   (DT-IMS) instrument for the measurement of aerosol particles. In DT-IMS,
   the electrical mobility of a measured particle is inferred directly from
   the time required for the particle to traverse a drift region, with
   motion driven by an electrostatic field. Electrical mobility
   distributions are hence linked to arrival time distributions (ATDs) for
   particles reaching a detector downstream of the drift region. The
   developed instrument addresses two obstacles that have limited DT-IMS
   use for aerosol measurement previously: (1) conventional drift tubes
   cannot efficiently sample charged particles at ground potential and (2)
   the sensitivities of commonly used Faraday plate detectors are too low
   for most aerosols. Obstacle (1) is circumvented by creating a sample
   volume of aerosol for measurement, defined by the streamlines of fluid
   flow. Obstacle (2) is bypassed by interfacing the end of the drift
   region with a condensation particle counter. The DT-IMS prototype shows
   high linearity for arrival time versus inverse electrical mobility (R-2
   > 0.99) over the size range tested (2.2-11.1nm), and measurements
   compare well with both analytical and numerical models of device
   performance. A dimensionless calibration curve linking drift time to
   inverse electrical mobility is developed. In less than 5s, it is
   possible to measure 11.1nm particles, while 2.2nm particles are
   analyzable on a subsecond scale. The transmission efficiency is found to
   be dependent upon electrostatic deposition for short drift times and
   upon advective losses for long drift times. Copyright 2014 American

Abstract = {{A fundamental category of location based services relies on predictive
   queries which consider the anticipated future locations of users.
   Predictive queries attracted the researchers' attention as they are
   widely used in several applications including traffic management,
   routing, location-based advertising, and ride sharing. This paper aims
   to present a generic and scalable system for predictive query processing
   on moving objects, e.g, vehicles. Inside the proposed system, two
   frameworks are provided to work in two different environments, (1) Panda
   framework for euclidean space, and (2) iRoad framework for road network.
   Unlike previous work in supporting predictive queries, the target of the
   proposed system is to: (a) support long-term query prediction as well as
   short term prediction, (b) scale up to large number of moving objects,
   and (c) efficiently support different types of predictive queries, e.g.,
   predictive range, KNN, and aggregate queries.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of wireless communication network, Vehicular Ad-hoc
   Network (VANET) has received considerable attentions. US Department of
   Transportation (USDOT) is piloting a deployment concept to encourage
   embedding and retrofitting vehicles with DSRC interface to support
   varieties of applications for both safety and non-safety purposes. In
   addition to traditional data service, many real-time video streaming
   applications are increasingly being developed over VANET. Although it is
   desirable to delivery the packets directly through single hop
   communications, such condition is not always available in the real
   environment. To support real-time video applications in VANET, we have
   to deeply understand their performance under multihop conditions and
   even with others' interference. To the best of our knowledge, no work
   has been done on measuring the multihop video streaming transmission
   performance with interference over real environment. In this paper, a
   DSRC device based test-bed is developed to investigate the performance
   of multihop real-time video streaming transmission and the impact of
   interference. To overcome the high packet loss rate which is a main
   shortage of video streaming transmission over VANET, we improve the
   application by adding retransmission and startup caching schemes. We
   also evaluate the performance of different retransmission strategies and
   analyze how to optimize the retransmission scheme for minimizing the
   number of collided and late packets based on the transmission rate of
   interference.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a tunable and high directivity coupler that is used
   a RF power monitor in ultra-high field magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   systems. High directivity of a coupler is a critical factor to assure
   the accurate output in the reflected power measurement. To obtain a
   tunable and high directivity coupler, a novel directivity tuner includes
   tunable capacitors and resistors in a passive circuit. A well-tuned
   capacitance and resistance compensates phase difference and improves
   directivity in MRI operating frequencies. Therefore, this method
   significantly reduces the uncertainty of power measurement outputs and
   can accurately determine reflected power with load variation. The
   measured results of the proposed coupler agree with the simulation data

Title = {{EFFECT OF UPSTREAM WALL SHEAR ON FLOW AND MASS (HEAT) TRANSFER ON A FLAT
   PLATE DOWNSTREAM OF A SHEAR INDUCING MOVINGWALL - A REVIEW}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENHANCED HEAT TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{4-5}},
Pages = {{323-352}},
Abstract = {{Flow and mass transfer experiments are conducted to study the effect of
   wall shear on a two-dimensional turbulent boundary layer. The shear at
   the boundary is imparted by a moving belt, flush with the wall. In the
   first case (Case 1), the wall shear is imparted along the direction of
   the flow. Velocity measurements are taken at 12 streamwise locations
   with four surface-to-freestream velocity ratios (0, 0.38, 0.52, 0.65)
   and a momentum-based Reynolds number between 770 and 1776. The velocity
   data indicate that the location of the ``virtual origin{''} of the
   turbulent boundary layer ``moves{''} downstream towards the trailing
   edge of the belt with increasing surface velocity. The highest belt
   velocity ratio (0.65) results in the removal of the ``inner{''} region
   of the boundary layer. Measurements of the streamwise turbulent kinetic
   energy (TKE) show an inner-scaling at locations upstream and downstream
   of the belt and the formation of a new self-similar structure on the
   moving surface itself. Good agreement is observed for the variation of
   the shape factor (H) and the skin friction coefficient (c(f)) with
   previous studies. Mass transfer measurements using naphthalene
   sublimation provide the variation of Stanton with Reynolds number on the
   plate downstream of the moving belt. It shows much reduced mass transfer
   due to removal of the inner region of the boundary at the highest belt
   velocity. In the second case (Case 2), the wall shear is in a direction
   opposite to the incoming flow. Boundary layer measurements are reported
   for four surface-to-freestream velocity ratios (0, 0.37, -0.50, -0.62)
   with the Reynolds number (based on the momentum thickness) between 922
   and 1951. Velocity profiles downstream of the moving surface show an
   increased velocity deficit near the wall, which is more pronounced at
   higher (negative) belt velocity. Streamwise turbulence values downstream
   of the belt show the growth of a second peak in the logarithmic region
   of the boundary layer in addition to the normally-observed peak in the
   buffer region. This suggests the presence of larger length-scale
   turbulent eddies at locations away from the wall in the boundary layer.
   Spectral measurements indicate that the turbulent energy content is
   distributed over a wide portion of the logarithmic region. Mass transfer
   measurements for this case show little difference from the stationary
   belt case, which suggests that increased wall turbulence is balanced by
   an increase in the boundary layer thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Hydraulic rescue spreaders are used by emergency response personnel to
   extricate occupants from a vehicle crash. A lighter and more portable
   rescue spreader is required for better usability and to enable
   utilization in a variety of scenarios. To meet this requirement,
   topological synthesis, dimensional synthesis, and an optimization were
   used to develop a solution linkage. The topological synthesis technique
   demonstrates that ten links are the minimum possible number that
   achieves the desired motion without depending primarily on rotation of
   the spreader jaws. A novel integrated kinematic-structural dimensional
   synthesis technique is presented and used in a grid-search optimizing
   the linkage dimensions to minimize linkage mass. The resulting ten-bar
   linkage meets or exceeds the kinematic performance parameters while
   simultaneously achieving a near-optimum predicted mass.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless rechargeable sensor network is a promising platform for
   long-term applications such as inventory management, supply chain
   monitoring and so on. For these applications, sensor localization is one
   of the most fundamental challenges. Different from traditional sensor
   node, wireless rechargeable sensor has to be charged above a voltage
   level by the wireless charger in order to support its sensing,
   computation and communication operations. In this work, we consider the
   scenario where a mobile charger stops at different positions to charge
   sensors, and propose a novel localization design that utilizes the
   unique Time of Charge (TOC) sequences among wireless rechargeable
   sensors. Specifically, we introduce two efficient region dividing
   methods, Inter-node Division and Inter-area Division, to exploit TOC
   differences from both temporal and spatial dimensions to localize
   individual sensor nodes. To further optimize the system performance, we
   introduce both an optimal charger stop planning algorithm for single
   sensor case and a suboptimal charger stop planning algorithm for the
   generic multi-sensor scenario with a provable performance bound. We have
   extensively evaluated our design by both testbed experiments and
   large-scale simulations. The experiment and simulation results show that
   by as less as 5 stops, our design can achieve sub-meter accuracy and the
   performance is robust under various system conditions.}},

Abstract = {{As battery-powered mobile devices become more popular and energy hungry,
   wireless power transfer technology receives intensive interests, as it
   allows the power to be transferred from a charger to ambient devices
   wirelessly. The existing studies mainly focus on the power transfer
   efficiency but overlook the health impairments caused by RF exposure. In
   this paper, we study the Safe Charging Problem (SCP) of scheduling power
   chargers so that more energy can be received while no location in the
   field has electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exceeding a given threshold
   R-t. We prove that SCP is NP-hard and propose a solution which provably
   outperforms the optimal solution to SCP with a relaxed EMR threshold (1
   - epsilon) R-t. Testbed results based on 8 Powercast TX91501 chargers
   validate our results. Extensive simulation results show that the gap
   between our solution and the optimal one is only 6.7\% when epsilon =
   0.1, while a naive greedy algorithm is 34.6\% below our solution.}},

Abstract = {{Key-value (k-v) storage has been used as a crucial component for many
   network applications, such as social networks, online retailing, and
   cloud computing. Such storage usually provides support for operations on
   key-value pairs, and can be stored in memory to speed up responses to
   queries. So far, existing methods have been deterministic: they will
   faithfully return previously inserted key-value pairs. Providing such
   accuracy, however, comes at the cost of memory and CPU time. In
   contrast, in this paper, we present an approximate k-v storage that is
   more compact than existing methods. The tradeoff is that it may,
   theoretically, return a null value for a valid key with a low
   probability, or return a valid value for a key that was never inserted.
   Its design is based on the probabilistic data structure called the
   ``Bloom Filter{''}, which was originally developed to test element
   membership in sets. In this paper, we extend the bloom filter concept to
   support key-value operations, and demonstrate that it still retains the
   compact nature of the original bloom filter. We call the resulting
   design as the kBF (key-value bloom filter), and systematically analyze
   its performance advantages and design tradeoffs. Finally, we apply the
   kBF to a practical problem of implementing a state machine in network
   intrusion detection to demonstrate how the kBF can be used as a building
   block for more complicated software infrastructures.}},

Abstract = {{An approach to control a hydrostatic dynamometer for the
   Hardware-In-the-Loop (HIT) testing of hybrid vehicles has been developed
   and experimentally tested. The hydrostatic dynamometer used, which is
   capable of regeneration, was specifically designed and built in-house to
   evaluate the fuel economy and control strategy of a hydraulic hybrid
   vehicle. The control challenge comes from the inertia of the dynamometer
   being only 3\% of that of the actual vehicle so that the dynamometer
   must apply, in addition to any drag torques, acceleration/deceleration
   torques related to the difference in inertias. To avoid estimating the
   acceleration which would be a non-causal operation, a virtual vehicle
   concept is introduced. The virtual vehicle model generates a reference
   speed profile which represents the behavior of the actual vehicle if
   driven on the road. The dynamometer control problem becomes one of
   enabling the actual vehicle-dyno shaft to track the speed of the virtual
   vehicle, instead of directly applying a desired torque. A
   feedback/feedforward controller was designed based upon an
   experimentally validated dynamic model of the dynamometer. The approach
   was successfully tested on a power-split hydraulic hybrid vehicle with
   acceptable speed and torque tracking performance.}},

Abstract = {{A Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) test-bed has been developed to
   experimentally demonstrate the energy storage concept proposed in {[}1]
   for offshore wind turbines. The design of the testbed has been adapted

   components of the system consist of an open accumulator, a hydraulic
   pumpmotor, air compressor/expander, an electrical generator and load, a
   differential gearbox and a hydraulic control valve. These components are
   first characterized and then a dynamic model of the system has been
   developed. The objective is to regulate the output current/voltage of
   the generator while maintaining a constant accumulator pressure in the
   presence of input and demand power variations in the system. This is
   achieved by Proportional-Integrator (PI) control of pumpmotor
   displacement and field current of the generator. The stability of these
   controllers has been proved using an energy-based Lyapunov function.

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the variable interval sampling based

   a varying interval sampling approach is presented to optimize the
   angular sampling interval for the reference profile, while maintaining
   the same total number of sampling points. The tracking performance is
   improved by considering the tracking errors between the sampling points
   in selecting the optimal sampling intervals. Experimental results from a
   time-varying internal model based camless engine valve actuation system
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. A quantitative
   analysis helps to highlight the strength of the variable interval
   sampling on less computational complexity and better tracking

Abstract = {{Previously, the authors have designed and implemented an active motion
   control ``virtual crankshaft{''} for a free piston engine, which enables
   precise piston tracking of desired trajectories. With this mechanism,
   the volume of the combustion chamber can be regulated, and therefore the
   pressure, temperature and species concentrations of in-cylinder gas can
   be adjusted in real-time which affect the combustion process directly
   This new degree of freedom enables us to conduct trajectory-based
   combustion control. In this paper a model of the free piston engine
   running homogeneous charge compression ignition combustion under variant
   piston trajectories is presented. The variant piston trajectories have
   the ability to change the compression ratio and accommodate different
   piston motion patterns between the top dead center and the bottom dead
   center The Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory reduced n-heptane
   reaction mechanism is employed in the model in order to describe the
   chemical kinetics under various piston trajectories. Analysis of the
   simulation results is then presented which reveals the piston trajectory
   effects on the combustion phenomena in terms of in-cylinder gas

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the influence of noise and vibration on
   auscultation with a digital stethoscope. Two types of vibrations, namely
   inputs through the patient chest and disturbances from the physician,
   influence the auscultation signal. The goal of this work is to reduce
   the influence of disturbances from the physician on the stethoscope's
   digital signal without effectively reducing the coupling between the
   transducer and the patient's chest.
   A multi-DOF rigid body vibration model consisting of discrete connected
   components is developed for a digital stethoscope. The model is
   experimentally validated and its parameters identified by using a thorax
   simulator and vibration shaker. The introduction of vibration isolation
   so as to reduce the influence of physician noise on the transducer is
   then pursued. It is shown that directly introducing soft foam vibration
   isolation between the transducer and the rest of the stethoscope
   structure leads to a reduction in coupling with the patient's chest. On
   the other hand, if the vibration isolation is introduced between the
   heavy transducer housing above the transducer and the rest of the
   stethoscope, then vibration isolation from the physician is achieved
   with a much less reduction in patient coupling. Experimental results are
   presented to study the influence of the proposed design changes.}},

Abstract = {{The efficiency of solar thermochemical cycles to split water and carbon
   dioxide depends in large part on highly effective gas phase heat
   recovery. Heat recovery is imperative for approaches that rely on an
   inert sweep gas to reach low partial pressures of oxygen during thermal
   reduction and/or use excess oxidizer to provide a higher thermodynamic
   driving potential for fuel production. In this paper, we analyze heat
   transfer and pressure drop of a tube-in-tube ceramic heat exchanger for
   the operating conditions expected in a prototype solar reactor for
   isothermal cycling of ceria. The ceramic tubes are filled with
   reticulated porous ceramic (RPC). The impacts of the selection of the
   composition and morphology of the RPC on heat transfer and pressure drop
   are explored via computational analysis. Results indicate a 10 pore per
   inch (ppi), 80-85\% porous alumina RPC yields effectiveness from 85 to
   90 percent.}},

Abstract = {{Solar hot water and space heating systems constructed of commodity
   polymers have the potential to significantly reduce the initial cost of
   solar thermal systems. However, a polymer absorber must be prevented
   from exceeding its maximum service temperature during stagnation. Here
   we consider the addition of a thermotropic material to the surface of
   the absorber. The thermotropic layer provides passive overheat
   protection by switching from high transmittance during normal operation
   to high reflectance if the temperature of the absorber becomes too high.
   In this paper, a one dimensional model of a glazed, flat-plate collector
   with a polymer absorber and thermotropic material is used to determine
   the effects of the optical properties of a thermotropic material on
   optical efficiency and stagnation temperature of the collector. A key
   result is identification of the reflectance in the translucent state
   required to provide overheat protection for potential polymer absorber
   materials. For example, the reflectance of a thermotropic material in
   the translucent state should be greater than or equal to 51\% for a
   polypropylene absorber which has a maximum service temperature of 115
   degrees C.}},

Abstract = {{Arterial disease occurs when plaque builds up in the arteries and limits
   flow of oxygen-rich blood to organs and other parts of the body reducing
   organ function. Atherectomy is a mechanical process in which plaque is
   removed from artery walls or modified to change vessel compliance.
   Various types of atherectomy systems exist to remove or modify plaque
   depending on plaque morphology. Orbital atherectomy (Diamondback 360 (R)
   Orbital Atherectomy System) is a sanding process utilizing a diamond
   abrasive crown mounted eccentrically to a flexible drive shaft.
   The effects of rotational speed, crown size, centrifugal forces and run
   time were evaluated. Finite element modeling and bench testing using
   carbon as a calcified plaque surrogate material were used.
   The crown-simulated vessel wall force was calculated using a finite
   element model that included a rigid vessel wall and a rotating crown.
   Results show a small force when the crown begins to rotate at lower
   speeds, that increases to a peak force at maximum speed, and decreases
   as the orbit diameter increases with material removal.
   A design of experiments plan was created and used to quantify the
   effects of crown size rotation speed and number of treatment passes on
   lumen diameter. Increasing the crown diameter increased lumen diameter
   nonlinearly at an increasing rate with crown rotation speed in the
   carbon model.
   Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis of the particulate material
   removed in the bench test demonstrated brittle fracture as the mode of
   material removal of the carbon surrogate.}},

Abstract = {{Centralized cloud infrastructures have become the de-facto platform for
   data-intensive computing today. However, they suffer from inefficient
   data mobility due to the centralization of cloud resources, and hence,
   are highly unsuited for dispersed-data-intensive applications, where the
   data may be spread at multiple geographical locations. In this paper, we
   present Nebula: a dispersed cloud infrastructure that uses voluntary
   edge resources for both computation and data storage. We describe the
   lightweight Nebula architecture that enables distributed data-intensive
   computing through a number of optimizations including location-aware
   data and computation placement, replication, and recovery. We evaluate
   Nebula's performance on an emulated volunteer platform that spans over
   50 PlanetLab nodes distributed across Europe, and show how a common
   data-intensive computing framework, MapReduce, can be easily deployed
   and run on Nebula. We show Nebula MapReduce is robust to a wide array of
   failures and substantially outperforms other wide-area versions based on
   a BOINC like model.}},

Abstract = {{To manage design complexity and provide verification tractability,
   models of complex cyber-physical systems are typically hierarchically
   organized into multiple abstraction layers. Formal reasoning about such
   systems, therefore, usually involves multiple modeling formalisms,
   verification paradigms, and associated tools. System properties verified
   using an abstract component specification in one paradigm must be shown
   to logically follow from properties verified possibly using a different
   paradigm on a more concrete component description. As component
   specifications at one layer of abstraction get elaborated into more
   concrete component descriptions at the next lower level, abstraction
   induced differences come to the fore; differences that have to be
   reconciled. In this paper, we present an approach to tie together
   distinct verification paradigms and reconcile these abstraction induced
   differences using a medical device cyber-physical system as an example.
   While the specifics are particular to the example at hand, we believe
   the techniques are applicable in similar situations for verifying
   cyber-physical system properties.}},

Abstract = {{Diesel engines running in a dual-fuel fumigation mode using injection of
   a high volatility fuel into the intake air and direct injection of
   diesel fuel can reduce NOX and particulate matter emissions. Fuels such
   as methanol, hydrogen, gasoline, and anhydrous ethanol have been studied
   as fumigants; however there has been less published regarding the use of
   high water content hydrous ethanol. Current production of ethanol yields
   anhydrous (200 proof) ethanol with no water content. The distillation
   and dehydration processes used to remove excess water from fermented
   starches during production require large amounts of input energy,
   reducing the renewability of the resulting fuel. This paper describes an
   experimental investigation of an aftermarket fumigation system provided
   by CleanFlex Power Systems, LLC. Experiments to measure gaseous and
   particulate emissions were conducted using 120 proof hydrous ethanol and
   non-oxygenated ultra-low sulfur diesel fuel. A John Deere 4045HF475 Tier
   2 engine was modified to incorporate the fumigation system in the intake
   plumbing downstream of the charge-air cooler, just prior to the intake
   manifold. Data was collected for dual fuel fumigation combustion and
   compared to diesel only combustion. This study shows that the fumigation
   system achieved lower levels of NOX and soot proportional to the
   fumigant energy fraction (FEF), but increased CO and hydrocarbon levels
   as compared to diesel-only combustion modes. The results suggest that
   increasing the FEF by using lower water content or better mixing through
   port-injection may increase the emissions reduction potential of hydrous
   ethanol fumigation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, radiative characterization of a packed bed of novel
   three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) ceria particles is
   performed in the spectral range relevant to solar thermochemical
   processes, 0.35-2.2 mu m. Normal hemispherical transmittance and
   reflectance of three samples of various thicknesses are measured. Monte
   Carlo ray-tracing and discrete ordinate methods are employed to identify
   transport scattering albedo and transport extinction coefficient in the
   spectral range corresponding to weak absorption in the semi-transparency
   band of ceria. 3DOM ceria particles are characterized by weaker
   scattering in comparison to sintered ceria ceramics, and increased
   transparency in the near-infrared spectral range 0.7-2 lam. The ordered
   pore-morphology of the 3DOM ceria after thermochemical redox cycling
   between temperatures 1373 K and 1073 K is altered due to sintering of
   walls of the 3DOM structure. The absorption coefficient of the packed
   bed is found to be practically independent of morphology. Radiative
   characterization of 3DOM ceria ceramics before and after thermochemical
   cycling suggests that preserving the 3DOM structure can lead to
   scattering characteristics that permit longer attenuation path lengths
   of incident concentrated solar radiation in the material, as well as be
   favorable for confinement of the near-infrared radiation during
   thermochemical cycling leading to favorable thermochemical conditions

Abstract = {{A thermotropic material is modeled as an absorbing, thin slab containing
   anisotropic scattering, monodisperse, spherical particles. Monte Carlo
   ray tracing is used to solve the governing equation of radiative
   transfer. Predicted results are validated by comparison to the measured
   normal-hemispherical reflectance and transmittance of samples with
   various volume fraction and relative index of refraction. A parametric
   study elucidates the effects of particle size parameter, scattering
   albedo, and optical thickness on the normal-hemispherical transmittance,
   reflectance, and absorptance. The results are interpreted for a
   thermotropic material used for overheat protection of a polymer solar
   absorber. For the preferred particle size parameter of 2, the optical
   thickness should be less than 0.3 to ensure high transmittance in the
   clear state. To significantly reduce the transmittance and increase the
   reflectance in the translucent state, the optical thickness should be
   greater than 2.5 and the scattering albedo should be greater than 0.995.
   For optical thickness greater than 5, the reflectance is asymptotic and
   any further reduction in transmittance is through increased absorptance.
   A case study is used to illustrate how the parametric study can be used
   to guide the design of thermotropic materials. Low molecular weighted
   polyethylene in poly(methyl methacrylate) is identified as a potential
   thermotropic material. For this material and a particle radius of 200
   nm, it is determined that the volume fraction and thickness should equal
   10\% and 1 mm, respectively.}},

   surrounding during the compression. One way to increase heat transfer is
   to implement an optimal compression trajectory, i.e., a unique
   trajectory maximizing the compression efficiency for a given compression
   time and compression ratio. The main part of the heat transfer model is
   the convective heat transfer coefficient (h) which in general is a
   function of local air velocity, air density and air temperature.
   Depending on the model used for heat transfer, different optimal
   compression profiles can be achieved. Hence, a good understanding of
   real heat transfer between air and its surrounding wall inside the
   compression chamber is essential in order to calculate the correct
   optimal profile. A numerical optimization approach has been proposed in
   previous works to calculate the optimal compression profile for a
   general heat transfer model. While the results show a good improvement
   both in the lumped air model as well as Fluent CFD analysis, they have
   never been experimentally proved. In this work, we have implemented
   these optimal compression profiles in an experimental setup that
   contains a compression chamber with a liquid piston driven by a water
   pump through a flow control valve. The optimal trajectories are found
   and experimented for different compression times. The actual value of
   heat transfer coefficient is unknown in the experiment. Therefore, an
   iterative procedure is employed to obtain h corresponding to each
   compression time. The resulted efficiency versus power density of
   optimal profiles is then compared with ad-hoc constant flow rate
   profiles showing up to \%4 higher efficiency in a same power density or
   \%30 higher power density in a same efficiency in the experiment.}},

Abstract = {{A major limitation of most methods exploiting sparse signal or spectral
   models for the purpose of estimating directions-of-arrival stems from
   the fixed model dictionary that is formed by array response vectors over
   a discrete search grid of possible directions. In general, the array
   responses to actual DoAs will most likely not be members of such a
   dictionary. In this work, the sparse spectral signal model with
   uncertainty of linearized dictionary parameter mismatch is considered,
   and the dictionary matrix is reformulated into a multiplication of a
   fixed base dictionary and a sparse matrix. Based on this double-sparsity
   model, an alternating dictionary learning-sparse spectral model fitting
   approach is proposed to reduce the estimation errors of DoAs and their
   powers. Group-sparsity estimator and Lasso-based Least Squares are
   utilized in the formulation of the associated optimization problem. The
   performance of the proposed methods are demonstrated by numerical
   simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer coefficients in a set of three symmetrically heated narrow
   gap channels arranged in line are reported at watt densities of 1
   kW/cm(3). This experimental configuration emulates an electronics system
   wherein power dissipation can vary across an array of processors, memory
   chips, or other components. Three pairs of parallel ceramic resistance
   heaters in a nearly adiabatic housing form the flow passage, and
   length-to-gap ratios for each pair of heaters is 34.1 at a gap of 0.36
   mm. Novec (TM) 7200 and 7300 are used as the heat transfer fluids.
   Non-uniform longitudinal power distributions are designed with the
   center heater pair at 1.5X and 2X the level of the first and third
   heater pairs. At all levels of inlet sub-cooling, single-phase heat
   transfer dominates heat transfer over the first two heater pairs, while
   the third pair exhibits significant increases because of the presence of
   flow boiling. Reynolds numbers range from 250 to 1200, Weber numbers
   from 2 to 15, and boiling numbers from O(10(-4)) to O(10(-3)). Exit
   quality can reach 30 percent in some cases. Overall heat transfer
   coefficients of 40 kW/m(2)K are obtained. Pressure drops for both Novec
   (TM) heat transfer fluids are approximately equal at a given mass flux,
   and a high coefficient of performance is obtained. With a mass flux of
   250 kg/m(2)s, heater temperatures can exceed 95 degrees C, which is the
   acceptable limit of steady operation for contemporary high performance
   electronics. Thus, an optimal operating point involving power density,
   power distribution, mass flux, and inlet sub-cooling is suggested by the
   data set for this benchmark multi-heater configuration.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic jets, known as zero-net mass-flux (ZNMF) devices, have been
   widely used for cooling electronics. A synthetic jet is generally
   composed of a cavity with an orifice on one side and an oscillating
   diagram on the other side. The vibration of the diaphragm will generate
   a periodically impinging flow through the orifice which is found to be
   effective in enhancing heat transfer. The thermal performance of the
   synthetic jet is highly dependent on the peak velocity of the synthetic
   jet is able to generate. The orifice shape, orifice thickness, and the
   number of the orifices are the factors which affect the vibration
   condition of the diaphragm and thus to affect the performance of the
   synthetic jet. This study will use both experimental and computational
   methods to find out the optimal design of synthetic jet and how these
   factors affect synthetic jet performance. The synthetic jet arrays are
   driven by a piezoelectric stack actuator which is vibrating at around
   720 Hz and the mean-to-peak amplitude is around 0.2 mm. The jet
   diaphragm (120 mm x 15 mm) is designed using a composite structure
   composed of a carbon fiber beam, a carbon fiber frame, and a jet frame
   fabricated by polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Four different orifice
   shapes (square, single slot, double slot, and triangle) with the same
   area have been designed and the square orifice has the highest velocity.
   The effect of the orifice thickness is also studied by testing four
   kinds of PM:MA films with different thicknesses (1.5 mm, 2 mm, 3 mm, and
   4.5 mm) and the case with 4.5 nun thick orifice has the best
   performance. The numerical simulation is conducted using the CFD
   software ANSYS Fluent to support the experimental results. The vibrating
   of the diaphragm is defined as a moving wall using a user defined
   function. The fluid power consumed by the diaphragm is used to determine
   the performances of different designs. The same trend with orifice
   thickness has been found and the reason has been demonstrated}},

Abstract = {{A One-Dimensional (One-D) numerical model to calculate transient
   temperature distributions in a liquid-piston compressor with porous
   inserts is presented. The liquid-piston compressor is used for
   Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES), and the inserted porous media
   serve the purpose of reducing temperature rise during compression. The
   One-D model considers heat transfer by convection in both the fluids
   (gas and liquid) and convective heat exchange with the solid. The Volume
   of Fluid (VOF) method is used in the model to deal with the moving
   liquid-gas interface. Solutions of the One-D model are validated against
   full CFD solutions of the same problem but within a two-dimensional
   computation domain, and against another study given in the literature.
   The model is used to optimize the porosity distribution, in the axial
   direction, of the porous insert. The objective is to minimize the
   compression work input for a given piston speed and a given overall
   pressure compression ratio. The model equations are discretized and
   solved by a finite difference method. The optimization method is based
   on sensitivity calculations in an iterative procedure. The sensitivity
   is the partial derivative of compression work with respect to the
   porosity value at each optimization node. In each optimization round,
   the One-D model is solved as many times as there are optimization nodes,
   and each time the porosity value at a single optimization node is
   changed by a small amount. From these calculations, the sensitivity of
   changing the porosity distribution to the total work input (objective)
   is obtained. Based on this, the porosity distribution is updated in the
   direction that favors the objective. Then, the optimization procedure
   marches to the next round and the same calculations are completed
   iteratively until an optimum solution is reached. The optimization shows
   that porous media with high porosity should be used in the lower part of
   the chamber and porous media with low porosity should be used in the
   upper part of the chamber. An optimal distribution of porosity over the
   chamber is obtained.}},

Abstract = {{The present. study presents CFD simulations of a liquid-piston
   compressor with metal foam inserts. The term ``liquid-piston{''} implies
   that the compression of the gas is done with a rising liquid-gas
   interface created by pumping liquid into the lower section of the
   compression chamber. The liquid-piston compressor is an essential part
   of a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system. The reason for
   inserting metal foam in the compressor is to reduce the temperature rise
   of the gas during compression, since a higher temperature rise leads to
   more input work being converted into internal energy, which is wasted
   during the storage period as the compressed gas cools.
   Liquid, gas, and solid coexist in the compression chamber. The
   two-energy equation model is used; the energy equations of the fluid
   mixture and the solid are coupled through an interfacial heat transfer
   term. The fluid mixture, which includes both the gas phase and the
   liquid phase, is modeled using the Volume of Fluid (VOF) method.
   Commercial CFD software, ANSYS FLUENT, is used, by applying its default
   VOF code, with user-defined functions to incorporate the two-energy
   equation formulation for porous media.
   The CFD simulation requires modeling of a negative momentum source term
   (drag), and an interfacial heat transfer term. The first one is the
   pressure drop due to the metal foam, which is obtained from experimental
   measurements. To obtain the interfacial heat transfer term, a
   compression experiment is done, which provides instantaneous pressure
   and volume data. These data are compared to solutions of a
   zero-dimensional compression model based on different heat transfer
   correlations from published references. By this comparison, a heat
   transfer correlation which is most suitable for the present study is
   chosen for use in the CFD simulation.
   The CFD simulations investigate two types of metal foam inserts, two
   different layouts of the insert (partial vs. full), and two different
   liquid piston speeds. The results show the influence of the metal foam
   inserts on secondary flows and temperature distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Heat transfer coefficients in sub-cooled flow boiling in symmetrically
   heated narrow gap channels are reported at power densities of 1 kW/cm(3)
   and greater. A pair of parallel ceramic resistance heaters in a nearly
   adiabatic housing forms the flow passage with length-to-gap ratios of
   16:1 and 34:1. Water, NovecTM 7200 and 7300 are used as the heat
   transfer fluids at a mass flux of 100 to 1000 kg/m(2)s. Reynolds numbers
   range from similar to 200 to similar to 5600, Weber numbers range from
   similar to 0.75 to similar to 173, and boiling numbers from O(10(-4))o
   O(10(-2)). Flow regimes span single-phase convection to nucleate flow
   boiling depending on mass flux and inlet sub-cooling, and exit quality
   can reach 40\% in some cases. Results include overall two-phase heat
   transfer coefficients, wall temperature, exit quality and coefficient of
   performance. The initiation of flow boiling demonstrates that mean
   heater temperatures can be maintained below 95 degrees C over a wide
   range of power density and up to and exceeding 1 kW/cm(3). A super
   position principle is suggested as an analytical framework to estimate
   exit quality and heat transfer coefficients. Highly favorable
   coefficients of performance across the data set indicate that the
   pumping power penalty within the heated zone is very small. Thus
   convective boiling in which the mechanism is nucleate boiling appears to
   hold the greatest potential to increase heat transfer coefficients,
   especially in small scale, inter-chip cooling strategies.}},

Abstract = {{An efficient and sufficiently power dense air compressor/expander is the
   key element in a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) approach.
   Efficiency can be increased by improving the heat transfer between air
   and its surrounding materials. One effective and practical method to
   achieve this goal is to use water droplets spray inside the chamber when
   air is compressing or expanding. In this paper, the air compression
   cycle is modeled by considering one-dimensional droplet properties in a
   lumped air model. While it is possible to inject water droplets into the
   compressing air at any time, optimal spray profile can result in maximum
   efficiency improvement for a given water to air mass ratio. The
   corresponding optimization problem is then defined based on the stored
   energy in the compressed air and the required input works. Finally,
   optimal spray profile has been determined for various water to air mass
   ratio using a general numerical approach to solve the optimization
   problem. Results show the potential improvement by acquiring the optimal
   spray profile instead of conventional constant spray flow rate. For the
   specific compression chamber geometry and desired pressure ratio and
   final time used in this work, the efficiency can be improved up to 4\%.}},

Abstract = {{In the Compressed Air Energy Storage (CABS) approach, air is compressed
   to high pressure, stored, and expanded to output work when needed. The
   temperature of air tends to rise during compression, and the rise in the
   air internal energy is wasted during the later storage period as the
   compressed air cools back to ambient temperature.
   The present study focuses on designing an interrupted-plate heat
   exchanger used in a liquid-piston compression chamber for CABS. The
   exchanger features layers of thin plates stacked in an interrupted
   pattern. Twenty-seven exchangers featuring different combinations of
   shape parameters are analyzed. The exchangers are modeled as porous
   media. As such, for each exchanger shape, a Representative Elementary
   Volume (REV), which represents a unit cell of the exchanger, is
   developed. The flow through the REV is simulated with periodic velocity
   and thermal boundary conditions, using the commercial CFD software ANSYS
   FLUENT. Simulations of the REVs for the various exchangers characterize
   the various shape parameter effects on values of pressure drop and heat
   transfer coefficient between solid surfaces and fluid. For an
   experimental validation of the numerical solution, two different
   exchanger models made by rapid prototyping, are tested for pressure drop
   and heat transfer. Good agreement is found between numerical and
   experimental results. Nusselt number vs. Reynolds number relations are
   developed on the basis of pore size and on hydraulic diameter.
   To analyze performance of exchangers with different shapes, a simplified
   zero-dimensional thermodynamic model for the compression chamber with
   the inserted heat exchange elements is developed. This model, valuable
   for system optimization and control simulations, is a set of ordinary
   differential equations. They are solved numerically for each exchanger
   insert shape to determine the geometries of best compression efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Fan-driven throughflow is frequently used for convective cooling of
   electronics. Channels with walls behaving like fins are common. In the
   present study, the flow inside the channels is agitated by means of
   translationally oscillating plates called agitators. Effectiveness of
   agitation by oscillating blades is found to be dependent on the channel
   width, a parameter studied herein. Heat sinks having narrower channels
   have a greater number of channels in total for the fixed size of heat
   sink and therefore greater heat transfer area than heat sinks with wider
   channels. Thus, with the same channel height, as the aspect ratio
   increases, channel width decreases, and it is found that opportunities
   for agitation are reduced and the generated turbulence is more strongly
   damped, thus reducing heat transfer coefficients. A study was carried
   out to find direction toward an optimal number of channels for a given
   heat sink using the agitation strategy. As part of the study, fluid
   damping and power consumption to drive the agitator assembly were
   addressed. The study was done numerically using ANSYS FLUENT on a
   representative single channel of the heat sink and the results were
   extended to the full size, multiple-channel heat sink system.
   Recommendations for moving toward an optimum geometry, based on thermal
   performance and agitator power are made.}},

Abstract = {{Rising thermal dissipation from modern electronics has increased the
   challenge of cooling using conventional heat sinks. In addition to fans
   and blowers, focus is turning to active cooling devices for augmenting
   performance. A piezoelectrically-actuated synthetic jet array is one
   under consideration. Synthetic jets are zero-net mass-flow jets realized
   by a cavity with an oscillating diaphragm on one side and an orifice or
   multiple orifices on the other side. They generate highly unsteady
   jetting flows that can impinge upon heated surfaces and enhance cooling.
   However, the synthetic jet actuation components might interfere with
   other components of the electronics module, such as the fan, requiring a
   displacement of the cavity center from the jet array center. Herein,
   heat transfer enhancement by an inclined piezoelectrically-actuated
   synthetic jet arrangement in a heat sink for electronics cooling has
   been experimentally and numerically studied. A wedge-shaped platform is
   designed to introduce the jets with an inclined configuration into the
   finned channels of the heat sink. The unit is inclined to avoid
   interference with other components of the module. The penalty is
   described in terms of velocities of jets emerging from this wedge-shaped
   platform, compared to those from an aligned cavity-orifice design.
   Effects on heat transfer performance for the heat sink are documented.
   The jets are arranged as wall jets passing over heat sink fins. The
   experimental study is complemented with a numerical analysis of flow
   within the synthetic jet cavity. Optimization is done on the number of
   jets against the penalty on jet velocity for obtaining maximum cooling
   performance. The jets are driven by piezoelectric actuators operating at
   resonance frequencies of 700-800 Hz resulting in peak jet velocities of
   approximately 35m/s from 92, 0.9 mm x 0.9 mm orifices. The results give
   guidance to those who face a similar interference problem and are
   considering displacement of the synthetic jet assembly.}},

Abstract = {{Thermal stratification of solar water storage tanks improves collector
   efficiency and provides higher quality energy to the user. A crucial
   aspect of maintaining stratification is preventing mixing in the tank,

   simple approach to flow control is an internal stratification manifold.
   In this paper, the performance of the rigid porous manifold, which
   consists of a series of vertical hydraulic resistance elements placed
   within a perforated tube, is considered for charging operation. A 1-D
   model of the governing mass, momentum, and energy conservation equations
   is used to illustrate the procedure for designing a manifold and to
   explore its performance over a broad range of operating conditions
   expected in solar water storage tanks. A manifold performance indicator
   (MPI) is used to evaluate the effectiveness of the manifold relative to
   an inlet pipe positioned at the top of the tank. The rigid porous
   manifold improves the stratification in the tank over a wide range of
   operating conditions unless the inlet flow rate is significantly reduced
   from the design point.}},

Abstract = {{This article presents a hybrid validation technique to test mathematical
   models and control systems for a High Speed Supercavitating Vehicle
   HSSV. The test method combines simulation of the vehicle motion,
   real-time experimental measurements of hydrodynamic forces acting at the
   vehicle wetted areas, and vehicle flight computer to evaluate the HSSV
   performance subject to steady and unsteady flows. The proposed
   validation platform is deployed in the high speed water tunnel located
   at the University of Minnesota Saint Anthony Falls Laboratory SAFL. The
   supercavitating test vehicle, operated with ventilation, consists of an
   actuated disk cavitator and two actuated lateral wedge fins. The model

Abstract = {{Frequently, to assess the life expectancy of Brazilian reservoirs,
   bedload flux has been estimated by using formulas (e.g. the Einstein
   equations) or by assuming that bedload represents a fixed percentage of
   the suspended load. This study was carried out to characterize the
   bedload flux on the basalt scarps of southern Brazil. The bedload was
   measured over the course of 12 stormflows. The results demonstrated that
   the bedload flux streamflow relationship was adequately described by a
   potential mathematical function. Bedload flux selectively transported
   particles smaller than Dse surface and subsurface bedstream sediments.
   When considering the bedload flux streamfiow relationship, the flux
   ranged from a minimum of 0.24 g m(-1) s(-1) for a strealuflow of 0.53
   m(3) s(-1) to a maximum of 44 g m(-1) s(-1) for a streamflow of 1.3 m(3)
   s(-1). The percentage of bedload/suspended load varied between <1\% up
   to 60\%, and this variation was strongly associated with peak flow.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents Mercury; a system for real-time support of top-k
   spatio-temporal queries on microblogs, where users are able to browse
   recent microblogs near their locations. With high arrival rates of
   microblogs, Mercury ensures real-time query response within a tight
   memory-constrained environment. Mercury bounds its search space to
   include only those microblogs that have arrived within certain spatial
   and temporal boundaries, in which only the top-k microblogs, according
   to a spatio-temporal ranking function, are returned in the search
   results. Mercury employs: (a) a scalable dynamic in-memory index
   structure that is capable of digesting all incoming microblogs, (b) an
   efficient query processor that exploits the in-memory index through
   spatio-temporal pruning techniques that reduce the number of visited
   microblogs to return the final answer, (c) an index size tuning module
   that dynamically finds and adjusts the minimum index size to ensure that
   incoming queries will be answered accurately, and (d) a load shedding
   technique that trades slight decrease in query accuracy for significant
   storage savings. Extensive experimental results based on a real-time
   Twitter Firehose feed and actual locations of Bing search queries show
   that Mercury supports high arrival rates of up to 64K microblogs/second
   and average query latency of 4 msec.}},

Abstract = {{The All-Pairs similarity search, or self-similarity join problem, finds
   all pairs of vectors in a high dimensional sparse dataset with a
   similarity value higher than a given threshold. The problem has been
   classically solved using a dynamically built inverted index. The search
   time is reduced by early pruning of candidates using size and
   value-based bounds on the similarity. In the context of cosine
   similarity and weighted vectors, leveraging the Cauchy-Schwarz
   inequality, we propose new l(2)-norm bounds for reducing the inverted
   index size, candidate pool size, and the number of full dot-product
   computations. We tighten previous candidate generation and verification
   bounds and introduce several new ones to further improve our algorithm's
   performance. Our new pruning strategies enable significant speedups over
   baseline approaches, most times outperforming even approximate
   solutions. We perform an extensive evaluation of our algorithm, L2AP,
   and compare against state-of-the-art exact and approximate methods,
   AllPairs, MMJoin, and BayesLSH, across a variety of real-world datasets

Abstract = {{Mars demonstration exploits the microblogs location information to
   support a wide variety of important spatiotemporal queries on
   microblogs. Supported queries include range, nearest-neighbor, and
   aggregate queries. Mars works under a challenging environment where
   streams of microblogs are arriving with high arrival rates. Mars
   distinguishes itself with three novel contributions: (1) Efficient
   in-memory digestion/expiration techniques that can handle microblogs of
   high arrival rates up to 64,000 microblog/sec. This also includes highly
   accurate and efficient hopping-window based aggregation for incoming
   microblogs keywords. (2) Smart memory optimization and load shedding
   techniques that adjust in-memory contents based on the expected query
   load to trade off a significant storage savings with a slight and
   bounded accuracy loss. (3) Scalable real-time query processing,
   exploiting Zipf distributed microblogs data for efficient top-k
   aggregate query processing. In addition, Mars employs a scalable
   real-time nearest neighbor and range query processing module that
   employs various pruning techniques so that it serves heavy query
   workloads in real time. Mars is demonstrated using a stream of real
   tweets obtained from Twitter firehose with a production query workload
   obtained from Bing web search. We show that Mars serves incoming queries
   with an average latency of less than 4 msec and with 99\% answer
   accuracy while saving up to 70\% of storage overhead for different query
   loads.}},

   use high level languages, such as Pig Latin, to deal with Hadoop for
   simplicity. Unfortunately, these languages are designed for primitive
   non-spatial data and have no support for spatial data types or
   functions. This demonstration presents Pigeon, a spatial extension to
   Pig which provides spatial functionality in Pig. Pigeon is implemented
   through user defined functions (UDFs) making it easy to use and
   compatible with all recent versions of Pig. This also allows it to
   integrate smoothly with existing non-spatial functions and operations
   such as Filter, Join and Group By. Pigeon is compatible with the Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standard which makes it easy to learn and
   use for users who are familiar with existing OGC-compliant tools such as
   PostGIS. This demonstrations shows to audience how to work with Pigeon
   through some interesting applications running on large scale real
   datasets extracted from OpenStreetMap.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time electricity pricing strategies for demand response in smart
   grids are proposed. By accounting for individual consumers'
   responsiveness to prices, adjustments are made so as to induce desirable
   usage behavior and reduce peaks in load curves. An online convex
   optimization framework is adopted, which provides performance guarantees
   with minimal assumptions on the dynamics of load levels and consumer
   responsiveness. Two feedback structures are considered: a full
   information setup, where aggregate load levels as well as individual
   price elasticity parameters are directly available; and a partial
   information ( bandit) case, where only the load levels are revealed.
   Fairness and sparsity constraints are also incorporated. Numerical tests
   verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

   These observations have led to a number of more sophisticated models

Abstract = {{A divide-and-conquer based approach for computing the Moore-Penrose
   pseudo-inverse of the combinatorial Laplacian matrix (L+) of a simple,
   undirected graph is proposed. The nature of the underlying sub-problems
   is studied in detail by means of an elegant interplay between L+ and the
   effective resistance distance (Omega). Closed forms are provided for a
   novel two-stage process that helps compute the pseudoinverse
   incrementally. Analogous scalar forms are obtained for the converse
   case, that of structural regress, which entails the breaking up of a
   graph into disjoint components through successive edge deletions. The
   scalar forms in both cases, show absolute element-wise independence at
   all stages, thus suggesting potential parallelizability. Analytical and
   experimental results are presented for dynamic (time-evolving) graphs as
   well as large graphs in general (representing real-world networks). An
   order of magnitude reduction in computational time is achieved for
   dynamic graphs; while in the general case, our approach performs better
   in practice than the standard methods, even though the worst case
   theoretical complexities may remain the same: an important contribution
   with consequences to the study of online social networks.}},

Abstract = {{Spintronic memory (STT-MRAM) is an attractive alternative technology to
   CMOS since it offers higher density and virtually no leakage current.
   Spintronic memory continues to require higher write energy, however,
   presenting a challenge to memory hierarchy design when energy
   consumption is a concern. Various techniques for reducing write energy
   have been studied in the past for a single processor, typically focusing
   on the last-level caches while keeping the first level caches in CMOS to
   avoid the write latency. In this work, use of STT-MRAM for the first
   level caches of a multicore processor is motivated by showing that the
   impact on throughput due to increased write latency is offset in many
   cases by increased cache size due to higher density. The Parsec
   benchmark suite is run on a modern multicore platform simulator,
   comparing performance and energy consumption of the spintronic cache
   system to a CMOS design. A small, fully-associative level-0 cache is
   then introduced (on the order of 8-64 cache lines), and shown to
   effectively hide the STT-MRAM write latency. Performance degradation due
   to write latency is restored or slightly improved, while cache energy
   consumption is reduced by 30-50\% for 12 of the 13 benchmarks.}},

Pages = {{461-475}},
Abstract = {{Domesticated wheat is very complex genetically due to its origins in an
   ancestral diploid species, which underwent a process of natural
   hybridization and subsequent polyploidization. All cultivated wheat
   varieties and their wild relatives contain epitopes, which are toxic in
   relation to celiac disease ( CD). RNAi is an excellent tool for
   silencing single genes or groups of them. Combining this technology with
   genetic manipulation the authors have down-regulated the toxic epitopes
   present in. omega-, gamma-, and alpha-gliadins of bread wheat.
   Monoclonal antibodies showed a decrease of almost 98\% in the presence
   of toxic gluten. Protein extracts from those lines were assayed using
   specific T lymphocytes for DQ2 and DQ8 epitopes, showing that the new
   wheat lines were 100 times less reactive than their parental genotypes.
   These results represent a major breakthrough in achieving wheat types
   suitable for CD patients. The silencing of gliadins is a new breeding
   trait and can be transferred by crossbreeding with elite wheat
   varieties. A daily intake between 10 and 50 mg of gluten could be safe
   for most CD patients, suggesting that the transgenic lines reported here
   could be used in foodstuffs tolerated by many CD patients. Moreover,
   these lines could serve as a basis for treating other gluten pathologies
   such as wheat-dependent exercise-induced anaphylaxis and gluten
   sensitivity.}},

   resonator of 100 mu m thickness. Here we describe the implementation of
   this method for the design of a thin film ultrasound detector. By

Abstract = {{Displacement estimation in ultrasound is a common yet important task for
   various applications, including tissue/blood motion estimation,
   elastography imaging, temperature estimation, etc. Accuracy of
   displacement estimation in the lateral direction is primarily limited by
   the coarse image resolution in this direction. Therefore, large lateral
   interpolation factors are needed to achieve fine sub-sample displacement
   estimation. In this paper, a zero phase crossing method is presented
   based on two dimensional complex normalized cross correlations (NCCs).
   Due to the fact that there is no analytic signal in the lateral
   direction, the phase of complex cross correlation is not necessarily
   linear. However, the subsample of maximum magnitude of complex
   correlation still lies on the zero phase line. Therefore, 2D
   displacement can be estimated by the intersection point of two zero
   phase lines, one from Hilbert transformation in the axial direction and
   the other one from Hilbert transformation in the lateral direction. We
   present 2D displacement estimation results, both simulations and
   experimental, to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over
   existing estimators.}},

Abstract = {{Bubble activity during the high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU)
   application could create overexposed lesion in very short period of time
   due to the increase in acoustic absorption. This process, however, can
   be utilized to drastically reduce the lesion formation time if the
   bubble activities can be reliably monitored and controlled. Furthermore,
   a phased array system could be used to reduce the volume lesion
   formation time by simultaneously invoking bubble activity at multiple
   focus locations, and independently adjust the intensity at each location
   based on the monitoring feedback. We present the results from an
   ultrasound-guided focused ultrasound platform designed to perform
   real-time monitoring and control of lesion formation using
   multiple-focus patterns. A dual-mode ultrasound array (DMUA) is used for
   both lesion formation and bubble activity monitoring with single
   transmit focusing (STF) imaging. The beam sequencing is designed to
   maintain spatial and temporal synchronization between therapy and
   imaging pulse, this ensures optimum STF imaging performance during the
   respective therapy application for reliable bubble activity detection.
   The DMUA is driven by a custom designed 32-channel arbitrary waveform
   generator and linear power amplifier. Use of arbitrary waveform and
   linear output allows optimum synthesis of multiple-focus pattern with
   minimum pre-focal artifacts. The beamformed RF data has been shown to be
   very sensitive to cavitation activity in response to HIFU in a variety
   of modes (e. g. boiling cavitation), which is characterized by sudden
   increase in echogenicity that could occur within milliseconds of the
   HIFU application. The STF beamforming and the signal processing chain
   are implemented on a multi-GPU platform and frame rate in excess of 500
   fps can be achieved. We present results from a series of experiments in
   bovine cardiac tissue demonstrating the robustness and increased speed
   of volumetric lesion formation. Results from our experiments demonstrate
   the feasibility of producing spatial and temporal modulations of
   multiple-focus DMUA patterns based on STF imaging feedback with
   millisecond resolution. This fine temporal and spatial control allows
   for achieving significant acceleration of volumetric coagulation rates
   within the target volume without overexposure to the tissue in the
   prefocal region.}},

Abstract = {{Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been proposed for a variety of transcranial
   applications, including neuromodulation, tumor ablation, blood brain
   barrier opening. A flurry of activity in recent years have generated
   encouraging results demonstrating its feasibility in these and other
   applications. To date, monitoring of FUS beams have been primarily
   accomplished using MR guidance, where both MR thermography and
   elastography have been used. With the use of dual-mode ultrasound array
   (DMUA) systems with real-time imaging capability, it is possible to
   localize sub-therapeutic and therapeutic transcranial FUS (tFUS) beams
   using ultrasound. We have designed and implemented a 64-channel DMUA
   system with real-time GPU-based beamformer capable of supporting single
   transmit focus (STF) imaging at frame rates in excess of 500 fps. A
   3.5-MHz, concave (40-mm roc), 32-element DMUA transducer was used to
   produce sub therapeutic tFUS while simultaneously imaging a decapitated
   head of a Copenhagen rat. A 150-mu m needle thermocouple was placed at
   the center of the brain to measure the tFUS induced temperature. DMUA
   imaging was used to localize the T/C needle and place the tFUS beam near
   the T/C junction. A number of sub-therapeutic tFUS beams with varying
   power were then generated while T/C measurements were recorded
   synchronously with the STF frames. Speckle tracking of echo data from
   the tFUS beam location within the brain was used to produce transcranial
   images of temperature change. We have also characterized the distortion
   to the array psf due to the skull using images of a 50-mu m wire at the
   center of the brain. The results show that, while the DMUA focus is
   degraded due to the propagation through the skull, it still produces
   localized heating effects within sub-millimeter volume. In addition,
   DMUA transcranial echo data from brain tissue allow for reliable
   estimation of temperature change through speckle tracking.}},

Abstract = {{The analytic nature of pulse-echo ultrasound allows for displacement
   tracking with fine axial resolution and strain estimations in tissue
   (elastography). The use of differential operators in strain
   calculations, however, can result in noise amplification and loss of
   specificity. In this paper a new method for direct estimation of Carotid
   artery wall strain parameters is presented. This method directly
   estimates the normal (e(xx), e(zz)) and shear strains (e(xz), e(zx)) on
   the anterior and posterior walls of human common carotid artery.
   This method utilizes the properties of local autocorrelation and the
   relationship between autocorrelation and power spectral density of the
   analytic RF echo signals. It is also shown that normal and shear strains
   can be estimated as parameters of an affine transformation. The steps of
   this new algorithm are based on properties of 2D autocorrelation
   function of the speckle region undergoing deformation. In vivo results
   from Carotid arteries of healthy human subjects show consistency over
   heart cycles.}},

Abstract = {{A model based technique for echo shift-based ultrasound temperature
   estimation is presented. First, the dynamic model is derived from direct
   discretization of the Pennes' bioheat equation. This model is then used
   in a Kalman filter setting for temperature tracking using the
   incremental temperature changes acquired at each discrete grid point as
   the measurements. In addition to tissue heterogeneity, natural motions
   and deformations during in vivo ultrasound thermography play a
   significant role in degrading the performance of the ultrasound
   thermography. Using the model based approach, we present the results of
   temperature estimation during sub-therapeutic high intensity focus
   ultrasound (HIFU) shots in the hind limb of Copenhagen rats in vivo. The
   results show continuous tracking of the temperature via pure prediction
   during significant error cycles or displacement tracking failure. These
   results represent an early validation of a fully adaptive
   spatial-temporal filtering of thermography data to compensate for tissue
   motions and deformations in vivo.}},

   MIC co-processors. We present the code structure that we developed in
   this work, beginning with its parallel implementation using
   heterogeneous MPI processes and proceeding to its parallel

   utilize high definition tDCS, a more spatially localized version of
   tDCS, to investigate the effect of anodal stimulation on human motor
   imagery performance. In parallel, we model this stimulation using a
   finite element model to calculate stimulation area and electrical field
   amplitude within the brain in the motor cortex and non-stimulated
   frontal and parietal regions. Overall, we found a delayed increase in

   two groups of subjects: five patients with intractable focal epilepsy,
   and ten healthy volunteers performing motor tasks. Spatial independent
   component analysis (ICA) was performed on the fMRI alone data and a set
   of independent component (IC) selection criteria was developed to
   identify epilepsy related ICs. The method was then evaluated in the
   healthy group with motor tasks. In all five surgery patients, there was
   at least one identified IC concordant with surgical resection. In the
   motor task study of healthy subjects, our method revealed components
   with concordant spatial and temporal features as expected from the
   unilateral motor tasks. These results suggest the lateralization and
   localization value of fMRI alone in presurgical evaluation for patients
   with intractable unilateral focal epilepsy. The proposed method is
   noninvasive in nature and easy to implement. It has the potential to be

Abstract = {{Current EEG based brain computer interface (BCI) systems have achieved
   successful control in up to 3 dimensions; however the current paradigm
   may be unnatural for many rehabilitative and recreational applications.
   Therefore there is a great need to find motor imagination (MI) tasks
   that are realistic for output device control. In this paper we present
   our results on classifying hand gesture MI tasks, including right hand
   flexion, extension, supination and pronation using a novel EEG inverse
   imaging approach. By using both temporal and spatial specificity in the
   source domain we were able to separate MI tasks with up to 95\% accuracy
   for binary classification of any two tasks compared to a maximum of only
   79\% in the sensor domain.}},

Abstract = {{Intermittent vagal nerve stimulation (VNS) has emerged as a potential
   therapy to treat cardiovascular diseases by delivering electrical
   stimulation to the vagus nerves. The purpose of this study was to
   investigate the electrophysiological changes in the atrium resulting
   from long-term intermittent VNS therapy in the chronic myocardial
   infarction (MI) rat model. MI was induced via left anterior descending
   coronary artery (LAD) ligation in male Sprague-Dawley rats, randomized
   into two groups: MI (implanted with nonfunctional VNS stimulators) and
   MI-VNS (implanted with functional VNS stimulators and received chronic
   intermittent VNS treatment) groups. Further, a sham group was used as
   control in which MI was not performed and received nonfunctional VNS
   stimulators. At 12 weeks, optical mapping of right atrium (RA) of sinus
   rhythm was performed. Our results demonstrated that chronic MI changed
   the electrical properties of the atrium action potentials and resulted
   in reduced action potential duration at 50\% (APD50) and 80\% (APD80)
   repolarization. Chronic right cervical VNS restored the APD back to
   healthy heart APD values. Additionally, APD heterogeneity index
   increased as a result of the chronic MI. Chronic VNS was not found to
   alter this increase. By calculating PR intervals from weekly ECG
   recordings of anaesthetized rats, we demonstrated that chronic MI and
   intermittent VNS did not affect the AV conduction time from the atria to
   the ventricles. From our study, we conclude the MI decreased the APD and
   increased APD spatial dispersion. VNS increased the APD back to healthy
   normal values but did change the APD spatial dispersion and the
   electrical conduction in the RA.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) coated with Protein-G have been a model
   system to be used in different antibodies binding study. It is highly
   desirable to use a substrate-free biosensing system to detect antibodies
   binding in real-time. In this paper, we developed and applied a MNPs and
   search-coils integrated detection system, which is not only sensitive to
   the hydrodynamic volume of MNPs but also sensitive to the environment of
   MNPs, such as viscosity and temperature of the solution. We demonstrated
   that the viscosity effect influenced the amplitudes and phases of the
   3rd (fH +/- 2fL) and 5th (fH +/- 4fL) harmonics for the mixed frequency
   testing scheme. The binding between antibodies and Protein-G on MNPs
   increased hydrodynamic volume of particles, as a result, it also changed
   the amplitudes and phases of harmonics, which are the object signals we
   need to analyze. We demonstrated that the viscosity of antibody solution
   is lower than that of MNP solution, and the antibody binding effect
   could be shielded by the viscosity effect to certain extent.}},

   comprehensive 64-channel receive beamformer with full dynamic focusing
   is embedded in the Altera Arria V FPGA chip. To improve spatial and
   contrast resolution, full dynamic beamforming is implemented by a novel
   method with resource optimization. This was conceived using the
   implementation of the delay summation through a bulk (coarse) delay and
   fractional (fine) delay. The sampling frequency is 40 MHz and the
   beamformer includes a 240 MHz polyphase filter that enhances the
   temporal resolution of the system while relaxing the Analog-to-Digital
   converter (ADC) bandwidth requirement. The results indicate that our
   64-channel dynamic beamformer architecture is amenable for a low power

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel patient-specific algorithm for detection of
   seizures in epileptic patients from a single-channel intra-cranial
   electroencephaolograph (iEEG) recording. Instead of extracting features
   from the EEG signal, first the EEG signal is filtered by a prediction
   error filter (PEF) to compute a prediction error signal. A two-level
   wavelet decomposition of the prediction error signal leads to two detail
   signals and one approximate signal. Eight features are extracted every
   one second using a 2-second window with a 50\% overlap. These features
   are input to two different types of classifiers: a linear support vector
   machine (SVM) classifier and an AdaBoost classifier. The algorithm is
   tested using the intra-cranial EEG (iEEG) from the Freiburg database. It
   is shown that the proposed algorithm can achieve a sensitivity of 95.0\%
   and an average false positive rate (FPR) of 0.124 per hour, using the
   linear SVM classifier. The AdaBoost classifier achieves a sensitivity of
   98.75\% and an average FPR of 0.075 per hour. These results are obtained
   with leave-one-out cross-validation. In addition, for 13 out of 18
   patients, the AdaBoost classifier requires only one feature, while it
   requires 4 features for the remaining 5 patients.}},

Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a serious mental illness that
   can cause significant suffering and carries a risk of suicide. Assigning
   an accurate diagnosis is critical to guide treatment. Currently, the
   diagnosis of BPD is made exclusively through the use of clinical
   assessment; no objective test is available to assist with its diagnosis.
   Thus, it is highly desirable to explore quantitative biomarkers to
   better characterize this illness. In this study, we extract spectral
   power features from the power spectral density and cross spectral
   density of resting-state fMRI data, covering 20 brain regions and 5
   frequency bands. Machine learning approaches are employed to select the
   most discriminating features to identify BPD. Following a leave-one-out
   cross validation procedure, the proposed approach achieves 93.55\%
   accuracy (100\% specificity and 90.48\% sensitivity) in classifying 21
   BPD patients from 10 healthy controls based on the top ranked features.
   The most discriminating features are selected from the 0.1 similar to
   0.15Hz frequency band, and are located at the left medial orbitofrontal
   cortex, the left thalamus, and the right rostral anterior cingulate
   cortex. The high classification accuracy indicates the discriminating
   power of the spectral power features in BPD identification. The proposed
   machine learning approach may be used as an objective test to assist
   clinical diagnosis of BPD.}},

Title = {{Day-of-Year Scaling Factors and Design Considerations for Nonmotorized
   Traffic Monitoring Programs}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2468}},
Pages = {{64-73}},
Abstract = {{General procedures, including the estimation of annual average daily
   traffic (AADT) from short-duration counts, have not been established for
   nonmotorized traffic monitoring programs. Continuous counts of
   nonmotorized traffic were collected at six locations on the off-street
   trail network in Minneapolis, Minnesota, in 2011. A new approach for
   estimating AADT values from short-duration counts, the use of
   day-of-year factors, is demonstrated. Analyses of variability in count
   data can be used to design a monitoring program that uses both
   continuous and short-duration counts of nonmotorized traffic. Five core
   conclusions may be useful for developing nonmotorized monitoring
   programs: (a) day-of-year scaling factors have smaller error than does
   the standard (day-of-week and month-of-year) method of AADT estimation,
   especially from short-duration counts (<1 week); (b) extrapolation error
   decreases with short-duration-count length, with only marginal gains in
   accuracy for counts longer than 1 week; (c) errors in estimating AADT
   values are lowest when short-duration counts are taken in summer (or
   spring, summer, and fall) months (April through October); (d) the impact
   of sampling on consecutive (successive) versus nonconsecutive (separate)
   days on AADT estimation is minimal but may reduce labor requirements;
   and (e) the design of a traffic monitoring program depends on the
   acceptable error, equipment availability, and monitoring period
   duration. Trade-offs in short-duration-count lengths and estimate
   accuracy will depend on resource constraints. Analysts can use
   day-of-year factors to improve the accuracy of AADT estimation. Analyses
   of variability in traffic counts can strengthen the design of monitoring
   programs.}},

Abstract = {{Planners are increasingly promoting active travel as a strategy to
   reduce auto dependence and encourage physical activity. That rail
   transit promotes walking to the extent that passengers typically access
   stations by walking is evident. However, few studies focus on the
   carryover effect of light rail and associated built environment features
   on additional pedestrian travel. This study explored the effects of
   light rail and the built environment on the frequency of utilitarian
   walking (shopping trips) and recreational walking (strolling) from 1,303
   randomly surveyed residents in five corridors in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
   Results from two negative binomial regression models showed that after
   controlling for demographics, travel attitudes, and residential
   preferences, walking to the store was significantly associated with
   population density, proximity to conunercial land use, and street
   network interruptions (cul-de-sacs and dead-end streets). Strolling was
   also associated with street network interruptions. The findings carry
   important implications for planners to capitalize on built environment
   iinprovements around new light rail projects to increase rates of
   walking.}},

Abstract = {{Instructors of both undergraduate and graduate courses of materials
   science with a laboratory section employ hands-on sessions to further
   students' understanding of key materials behavior principles. A typical
   solid mechanics laboratory session exposes students to topics such as:
   tensile, torsion, hardness, fatigue, and fracture testing procedures as
   well as associated properties and the like. Even though observing the
   different modes of material deformation and rupture response first-hand
   fosters a better mastery of the course content, limitations in available
   ``face time{''} with students, course budget, availability of test
   devices, etc., are obstacles. Integrating software tools that simulate
   mechanical testing represents an alternative approach that can
   potentially transform and enhance the students learning outcomes. The
   identical graphical user interface is used for conducting both virtual
   and physical testing of materials. The software tools will aid in the
   classroom, laboratory, and student self-study for the subjects of a
   material's plastic yielding, stress-strain relationships, fatigue, crack
   growth, and fracture. These same tools are then used in the laboratory
   to perform physical testing. This integrated virtual/physical curriculum
   prepares the student in test setup, execution and data analysis and
   makes the laboratory experience more efficient. It is also instructive
   for gaining an understanding of the value and limitations of modeling
   approaches in describing material behavior.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the size effect on the
   fracture properties (fracture toughness, tensile and flexural strengths,
   and their statistical characteristics) of nuclear graphite through
   numerical modeling. The continuum damage mechanics (CDM) model was used
   to simulate the fracture of nuclear graphite under different loading
   conditions. The damage behavior of nuclear graphite was considered
   through a traction-separation relationship. Three fracture tests were
   simulated-bars under tension, un-notched beams under three-point
   bending, and single-edge-notched beams under three-point bending-with
   each test including specimens of different sizes. The microstructural
   heterogeneity of nuclear graphite was modeled by assigning the elements
   with properties randomly created with a Weibull distribution. Using the
   maximum loads obtained from the simulated load-displacement curves, the
   strength and fracture toughness were predicted according to beam theory
   and fracture mechanics theory, respectively. Monte Carlo analyses were
   conducted to predict the statistical characteristics of the predicted
   fracture properties. The numerical predictions were compared with
   experiments, including those performed by the authors. Most of the
   predicted fracture properties showed size effects. For the range of
   specimen sizes considered, with an increase in specimen size, (1) the
   mean tensile strength remained almost constant, (2) the mean bend
   strength decreased, and (3) the fracture toughness increased. Besides
   the mean values, the variations of the fracture properties caused by the
   inherent heterogeneity of the material also showed a size effect: the
   smaller the specimen size, the bigger the scatter in the predicted
   values. These simulated results were mostly consistent with experimental
   data. By combining the effect of material damage and microstructural
   heterogeneity, one can correctly simulate the size effect seen in the
   fracture properties, the mean values and the variations, of nuclear
   graphite. This method can be used to understand the complex fracture
   behaviors of different nuclear graphite grades under different loading
   conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a pervasive theme of
   multi-disciplinary research. Focused on circuit-theoretic applications,
   in this paper, we derive sufficient conditions for global asymptotic
   synchronization in a system of identical nonlinear circuits coupled
   through linear time-invariant (LTI) electrical networks. The nonlinear
   circuits are composed of a parallel combination of passive LTI circuit
   elements and a nonlinear voltage-dependent current source with finite
   gain. The terminals of the nonlinear circuits are coupled through LTI
   networks characterized by either identical per-unit-length impedances or
   identical effective impedances between any two terminals. This setup is
   motivated by a recently proposed control strategy for inverters in
   microgrids. We analyze synchronization by means of an input-output
   analysis of a coordinate-transformed system that emphasizes signal
   differences. To apply the synchronization analysis to a broad class of
   networks, we leverage recent results on Kron reduction-a circuit
   reduction and transformation procedure that reveals the interactions of
   the nonlinear circuits. We illustrate our results with simulations in
   networks of coupled Chua's circuits.}},

Abstract = {{In multi-robot systems, efficiently navigating in a a partially-known
   environment is an ubiquitous but challenging task, as each robot must
   account for the uncertainty introduced, for example, by other moving
   robots. This uncertainty makes pre-computed plans not always applicable,
   and often hinders the desired efficient use of the robot's resources. In
   this work, we present a local anytime approach for robot motion planning
   that accounts for the uncertainty of the environment by generating
   `snapshots' of possible future scenarios. Our approach adapts the
   Hindsight optimization technique to allow robots to plan their immediate
   motion based on long-term efficiency. We validate our approach by
   comparing the efficiency on the paths executed against a state-of-the
   art navigation technique in a variety of scenarios, and show that by
   accounting for the uncertainty in the environment, agents can improve
   their time- and energy-efficient motions.}},

Abstract = {{We study the lion-and-man game in which a group of lions (the pursuers)
   try to capture a man (the evader). The players have equal speed. They

   planar domains such as polygons, very little is known about its
   properties in higher dimensions. In this paper, we study the lion and
   man game when played on the surface of a genus-zero polyhedron with
   boundary. We show that three lions with non-zero capture distance delta
   can capture the man in time O((A/delta(2) + L/delta)(2) delta/2) where A
   is the area of the surface, and L is the total edge length of the

Abstract = {{Given the rise in surgeries performed with surgical robots and
   associated robotics research efforts, tool tracking methods have the
   potential to provide quantitative feedback concerning surgical
   performance and establish absolute tool tracking to help advance
   surgical robotics research. We have created a platform-agnostic method
   for low-cost tracking of surgical tool shafts in Cartesian space in near
   real time. We employ a joint Hough Transform - Geometric Constraint
   approach to locate the tool tips in the stereo camera channels
   independently. Cartesian coordinates are registered using a custom
   polynomial depth - disparity model.
   The algorithm was developed using a low-cost experimental webcam setup
   and evaluated using a da Vinci surgical endoscope. The algorithm was
   benchmarked for 3D tracking accuracy and computational speed. The system
   can locate the tool tip in 3D space with an average accuracy of 3.05 mm
   at 25.86 frames per second using the webcam setup. For the endoscope
   setup this algorithm has an average tracking accuracy of 8.68 mm in 3D
   and 1.88 mm in 2D with an average frame rate of 26.9 FPS. The algorithm
   also demonstrated successful tracking of tools using captured video from
   a real surgical procedure.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of tracking mobile targets using a team of aerial
   robots. Each robot carries a camera to detect targets moving on the
   ground. The overall goal is to plan for the trajectories of the robots
   in order to track the most number of targets, and accurately estimate
   the target locations using the images. The two objectives can conflict
   since a robot may fly to a higher altitude and potentially cover a
   larger number of targets at the expense of accuracy.
   We start by showing that k >= 3 robots may not be able to track all n
   targets while maintaining a constant factor approximation of the optimal
   quality of tracking at all times. Next, we study the problem of choosing
   robot trajectories to maximize either the number of targets tracked or
   the quality of tracking. We formulate this problem as the weighted
   version of a combinatorial optimization problem known as the Maximum
   Group Coverage (MGC) problem. A greedy algorithm yields a 1/2
   approximation for the weighted MGC problem. Finally, we evaluate the
   algorithm and the sensing model through simulations and preliminary
   experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the problem of searching for an unknown moving target
   in a bounded two-dimensional convex area with a mobile robot. A key
   component of designing a search strategy is the target motion model,
   which is often unknown in practical scenarios. When designing search
   strategies, researchers either (1) ignore the target motion and treat
   the target as a stationary object with unknown location, (2) treat the
   target as an adversary and model the search task as a game, or (3) use a
   stochastic model such as a random walk. For each of these models we
   analyze possible search paths with the objective of minimizing the
   expected capture time. Our intent is to investigate how the choice of
   the model influences the choice of the strategy and consequently how the
   capture time will depend on this choice. In addition to a theoretical
   analysis, we compare the strategies in simulation.}},

Abstract = {{A large class of human movements rely on the so-called hand-eye
   coordination for precise and versatile performance. Teleoperation of
   agile robotic systems in three dimensional environments would benefit
   from a detailed understanding of the perceptual control mechanisms used
   by the operator both for the design of operator interfaces and
   potentially for the use of gaze information as part of the control
   mechanism. The objective of this work is to model the role and
   contribution of the operator's gaze motion in remote control operation
   of an agile vehicle. The experiments were conducted using a miniature
   remote controlled helicopter. The overall human-machine system is
   described using a multi-loop manual control model. Experiments were
   designed and conducted to exercise different aspects of this control
   hierarchy, encompassing stabilization and regulation as well as
   trajectory tracking and goal directed guidance. The sensing requirements
   for each loop are established by investigating the relationship between
   the operator's visual gaze trajectories, the vehicle trajectories, and
   the control actions. Visual gaze data is classified according to the
   typical smooth pursuit, saccades and fixations and then incorporated
   into an estimation strategy.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, we developed a skin-like tactile sensor array to
   measure the contact pressure of curved surfaces. The sensor array is
   laminated into a thin film with 3mm in thickness and can easily be
   wrapped around a pencil without damaging its skin-like structure. So far
   we have achieved the array containing 8 x16 sensor elements. Its spatial
   resolution is 1 element per 9mm(2) area and it can measure the pressure
   up to 360kPa. The sensor-array patch contains three layers. The upper
   and lower layers are polyclimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin films embedded
   with conductor strips formed by PDMS-based silver nanowires (AgNAVs)
   networks. The middle layer is formed by the mixing of nickel powder with
   liquid PDMS for contact force measurement. Experimental tests have
   demonstrated that conductor strips on the upper layer can maintain their
   resistances around 23 Omega with less than 4 Omega increase when the
   tensile strain is up to 50\%. Noted is that conductors made with carbon
   nanotubes can keep its conductivity unchanged for up to only 40\%
   tensile strain. Through fatigue tests, it is observed that the measured
   AgNWs/PDMS conductor strip exhibits low and stable resistances. This is
   one of the desired behaviors of the stretchable interconnects for signal
   transmission. The integrated sensor system can successfully measure the
   contact pressure induced by objects of different shapes. It can be
   applied on curved or non-planar surfaces in robots or medical devices
   for force detection and feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Model-based fault detection methods can be used to reduce the size,
   weight, and cost of safety-critical aerospace systems. However, the
   implementation of these methods is based on models. Therefore,
   disturbance and model uncertainty must be considered in order to certify
   the fault detection system. This paper considers the worst-case false
   alarm probability over a class of stochastic disturbances and model
   uncertainty. This is one analysis needed to assess the overall system
   reliability. The single step, worst-case false alarm probability is
   shown to be equivalent to a robust H2 analysis problem. Hence known
   results from the robust H2 literature can be used to upper bound this
   worst-case probability. Next, bounds are derived for the worst-case
   false alarm probability over multiple time steps. The multi-step
   analysis is important because reliability requirements for aerospace

Abstract = {{Existing low-cost unmanned aerospace systems are unreliable, and
   engineers must blend reliability analysis with fault-tolerant control in
   novel ways. This paper performs a conventional failure modes and effects
   analysis for a small unmanned aerial vehicle and extends the analysis by
   examining nonlinear and linear system properties. Failure likelihood,
   severity, and risk are qualitatively assessed for several effector
   failure modes. Vehicle tolerance of elevator actuator failures is
   studied further using high-fidelity simulations, and the achievable
   steady, wings-level flight envelope is determined for the healthy and

Abstract = {{Wind turbines are typically operated to maximize their own performance
   without considering the impact of wake effects on nearby turbines. There
   is the potential to increase total power and reduce structural loads by
   properly coordinating the individual turbines in a wind farm. The
   effective design and analysis of such coordinated controllers requires
   turbine wake models of sufficient accuracy but low computational
   complexity. This paper first formulates a coordinated control problem
   for a two-turbine array. Next, the paper reviews several existing
   simulation tools that range from low-fidelity, quasi-static models to
   high-fidelity, computational fluid dynamic models. These tools are
   compared by evaluating the power, loads, and flow characteristics for
   the coordinated two-turbine array. The results in this paper highlight
   the advantages and disadvantages of existing wake models for design and
   analysis of coordinated wind farm controllers.}},

   we seek solutions to the l(1) regularized version of the standard H-2

   optimization to create an uncertainty model, for the purpose of
   synthesizing a robust controller, from a set of experimental frequency

   uncertainty model for the dual-stage actuator are described. The
   proposed method is applied to a set of frequency response data of
   dual-stage actuators from numerous hard disk drives to create an
   uncertainty model of the actuator. Then the uncertainty model is used to
   synthesize a robust control law, which is implemented and experimentally

   track following (head position control) on hard disk drive spin stand

   linearization, a high-bandwidth feedback controller, an adaptive
   feedforward controller, and the Zero acceleration path technique.
   Experiments with a Seagate disk with track width of 77 nm showed that
   the servo control system could reduce the three-sigma (standard
   deviation) of the repeatable head position error to similar to 2.7 nm
   and the three-sigma of the non-repeatable error to similar to 2.2 nm. At
   the end it is demonstrated that with the track following ability, the
   head can coherently write and read data to and from the disk even with
   the presence of internal and external disturbances to the head.}},

   testbed within the Center for Compact and Efficient Fluid Power. In this
   paper, the design and experimental implementation of a three-level

   hardware are presented. This control strategy segregates the tasks of
   the drive-train into three layers that respectively 1) manages the
   accumulator energy storage (high level); 2) performs vehicle level
   optimization (mid-level); and 3) attains the desired vehicle operating
   condition (low level). Different high level energy management strategies
   can be employed without affecting the mid and low level controllers. Two
   ``high level{''} energy management strategies have been implemented and
   experimentally tested initially, a continuously variable transmission
   (CVT) strategy used as a baseline for comparison, and a rule based
   hybrid strategy. Results illustrate that the mid and low level
   power-train control satisfy the driver's demand and the efficiency is

Abstract = {{Underwater vehicles traveling inside a bubble or supercavity enable the
   reduction of drag and increase of speed; however, planing forces
   generated when the vehicle aft end pierces the bubble can lead to
   oscillatory motion and instability. In this paper, a framework for the
   synthesis of planing avoidance controllers is presented and the
   trade-off between tracking performance and planing avoidance is
   investigated. We propose mathematical models of the supercavity and
   planing forces, based on experimental data, that are used to construct a
   nonlinear model of the vehicle dynamics and a simplified version
   suitable for analysis and controller synthesis. A planing metric, based
   on the simplified vehicle dynamics, is used within the controller
   synthesis to avoid planing. Simulations of vehicle maneuvers demonstrate
   that including planing avoidance as a control objective, reduces planing
   and increases the bounds of tracking commands for which the vehicle
   remains stable.}},

Abstract = {{A high-level supervisory controller is developed for a Compressed Air
   Energy Storage (CAES) system integrated with a wind turbine.
   Complementary to the low-level controllers in our previous works to
   track generator power and pressure, this controller coordinates
   different subsystems to optimize the system performance. The control
   strategy is obtained by solving an optimal storage/ regeneration problem
   in order to maximize the achievable total revenue from selling
   electricity to the electric grid. Dynamic Programming (DP) approach is
   used to solve the corresponding optimal control problem that accounts
   for all the major losses in the CAES system as well as its nonlinear
   dynamics. Results show that an increase of 51\% in total revenue is
   achievable by using the CAES system for a conventional wind turbine.
   Furthermore, a case study has been conducted to investigate the effect
   of storage system sizing on the maximum revenue.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the nonlinear identification and the robust position
   tracking control of a camless engine valve actuator in frequency domain.
   If a periodic signal excites a nonlinear system, it turns out to
   generate output spectrum at multiple harmonic frequencies other than
   that of the excitation. Therefore, such nonlinear features should be
   taken account in tracking control system design to improve tracking
   performance. First, nonlinear identification with a Volterra series
   representation is proposed to capture nonlinearities. Then, robust
   tracking control of an uncertain Volterra system based on the internal
   model principle is addressed. It argues that an internal model unit
   should embed the extended generating dynamics to suppress tracking error
   occurring at multiple harmonics. To validate the control design method,
   the tracking results of two different generating dynamics are compared.
   From the comparison, tracking performance advances through the extended
   generating dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Second-order statistics of turbulent flows can be obtained either
   experimentally or via high fidelity numerical simulations. The
   statistics are relevant in understanding fundamental flow physics and
   for the development of low-complexity models. For example, such models
   can be used for control design in order to suppress or promote
   turbulence. Due to experimental or numerical limitations it is often the
   case that only partial flow statistics are known. In other words, only
   certain correlations between a limited number of flow field components
   are available. Thus, it is of interest to complete the statistical
   signature of the flow field in a way that is consistent with the known
   dynamics. Our approach to this inverse problem relies on a model
   governed by stochastically forced linearized Navier-Stokes equations. In
   this, the statistics of forcing are unknown and sought to explain the
   given correlations. Identifying suitable stochastic forcing allows us to
   complete the correlation data of the velocity field. While the system
   dynamics impose a linear constraint on the admissible correlations, such
   an inverse problem admits many solutions for the forcing correlations.
   We use nuclear norm minimization to obtain correlation structures of low
   complexity. This complexity translates into dimensionality of
   spatio-temporal filters that can be used to generate the identified
   forcing statistics.}},

Abstract = {{The performance of a hydraulic motor is strongly influenced by the
   timing, leakage, and friction of the valves connecting to the pressure
   and tank ports. For the application of a linkage-based hydraulic piston
   motor, a novel clearance sealed cylindrical rotary valve is introduced.
   A model of the cylinder pressure dynamics is formulated from the bulk
   modulus definition and solved using a variable-step Runge-Kutta stiff
   solver. Energy loss equations are developed and used to aid the creation
   of objective functions. A geometric optimization of the motoring
   efficiency is conducted based on coupled relationships: including
   throttling across the transitioning and fully open valve ports, viscous
   friction, and leakage, but excluding piston related losses. A simple
   genetic algorithm is used to obtain the optimized geometry, and a
   theoretical system efficiency greater than 97\% is achieved. A
   multi-objective sub-population genetic algorithm is then used to
   generate Pareto Optimal solutions for different combinations of
   efficiency and output power. A sensitivity study of the valve timing and
   rotational frequency shows the starting angle of the pressure port and
   the width of the rotor orifice dominate the performance while the system
   frequency has negligible effects.}},

Abstract = {{A novel pressure-controlled hydro-mechanical transmission (PHMT) is
   studied in this paper. The PHMT consists of a pressure-controlled
   hydraulic transmission (PCT) and a variable displacement hydraulic
   motor. The PCT functions like a conventional hydrostatic transmission
   (HST) but has a different form. It uses a double-acting vane pump with a
   floating ring. By coupling the floating ring to an output shaft, the
   vane pump becomes a hydraulic transmission. The PCT combines the pumping
   and motoring functions in one unit, making it much simpler than a
   conventional HST. By controlling the pressure in the PCT, the output
   shaft torque and speed can be adjusted. By feeding the PCT control flow
   to a variable displacement motor coupled to the PCT output shaft, a PHMT
   is constituted. In this paper, the fundamental principle of the PHMT is
   studied. To demonstrate its advantage, the PHMT is applied to a fan
   drive system and the transmission efficiency is compared to a
   conventional HST. Preliminary experimental results show that the input
   power of the fan drive system with a PHMT is lower than that with an HST
   given the same output fan speed and torque.}},

Abstract = {{To enable simulation of tiny hydraulic systems, including predicting
   system efficiency, it is necessary to determine the effect of the
   hydraulic cylinder piston seal. For tiny cylinders whose bore is less
   than 10 mm, O-ring seals are convenient. Simplified models for the
   O-ring were used to describe piston leakage and friction and based on
   the models, the force and volumetric efficiencies for tiny cylinders
   were predicted for a range of steady state operating conditions. To
   validate the models, a test stand was constructed to collect
   experimental data for 4, 6 and 9 mm bore cylinders, which were in the
   form of a vertical ram with a single O-ring seal. The ram was fully
   extended and put under load. A needle valve was then cracked to cause
   the ram to descend at different speeds. Pressure, load and velocity were
   recorded and the data used to calculate cylinder efficiencies, which
   were then compared to model predictions. The model and the experiment
   showed essentially zero leakage. The experimental force efficiency had
   good agreement with the model over a range of operating conditions. The
   study showed that simple O-ring models for tiny hydraulic cylinders
   suffice for building system level simulation models.}},

Abstract = {{The technical performance of a hybrid `solar window' that provides

   into the interior space. The optical performance of the CPC/selective
   film is predicted using a Monte Carlo Ray-Tracing model. An adaptive
   concentrator geometry based on asymmetrical truncation of CPCs is
   analyzed for vertical windows. The predicted visible transmittance is
   0.61 to 0.67 for double glazed windows. The solar heat gain coefficient
   and the U-factor are comparable to existing glazing technology. The
