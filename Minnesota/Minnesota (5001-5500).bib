Abstract = {{The purpose of this article is to examine some of the models commonly
   used to represent fading as well as the information-theoretic metrics
   most commonly used to evaluate performance over those models. We raise
   the question of whether these models and metrics remain meaningful in
   light of the advances that wireless systems have undergone over the last
   two decades. A number of weaknesses are pointed out, and ideas on
   possible fixes are put forth. Some of the identified weaknesses have to
   do with models that, over time, have become grossly inadequate. Other
   weaknesses have to do with changes in the operating conditions of
   wireless systems, and others with the coarse and asymptotic nature of
   some of the most popular performance metrics ({''}diversity{''} and
   ``multiplexing{''}).}},

Abstract = {{A new plasmonic device architecture based on ultrasmooth metallic
   surfaces with buried plasmonic nanostructures is presented. Using
   template-stripping techniques, ultrathin gold films with less than 5
   angstrom surface roughness are optically coupled to an arbitrary
   arrangement of buried metallic gratings, rings, and nanodots. As a
   prototypical example, linear plasmonic gratings buried under an
   ultrasmooth 20 nm thick gold surface for biosensing are presented. The
   optical illumination and collection are completely decoupled from the
   microfluidic delivery of liquid samples due to the backside,
   reflection-mode geometry. This allows for sensing with opaque or highly
   scattering liquids. With the buried nanostructure design, high
   sensitivity and decoupled backside (reflective) optical access are
   maintained, as with traditional prism-based surface plasmon resonance
   (SPR) sensors. In addition, the benefits offered by nanoplasmonic
   sensors such as spectral tunability and high-resolution, wide-field SPR
   imaging with normal-incidence epi-illumination that is simple to
   construct and align are gained as well. Beyond sensing, the buried
   plasmonic nanostructures with ultrasmooth metallic surfaces can benefit
   nanophotonic waveguides, surface-enhanced spectroscopy, nanolithography,
   and optical trapping.}},

Abstract = {{Diesel exhaust emissions have been reported for a number of engine
   operating strategies, after treatment technologies; and fuels; However,
   information is limited regarding emissions of many pollutants during
   idling and when biodiesel fuels are used This study investigates
   regulated and unregulated emissions from both light duty passenger car
   (1.7 L) and medium duty (6.4 L) diesel engines at idle and load and
   compares a biodiesel blend (B20) to conventional ultralow sulfur diesel
   (ULSD) fuel. Exhaust aftertreatment devices included a diesel oxidation
   catalyst (DOC) and a diesel particle filter (DPF). For the 1.7 L engine
   under load without a DOC, B20 reduced brake-specific emissions of
   particulate matter (PM), elemental carbon (EC), nonmethane hydrocarbons
   (NMHCs), and most volatile organic compounds (VOCs) compared to ULSD;
   however, formaldehyde brake-specific emissions increased. With a DOC and
   high load, B20 increased brake-specific emissions of NMHC, nitrogen
   oxides (NOx), formaldehyde, naphthalene, and Several other VOCs. For.
   the 64 L engine under load, B20 reduced brake specific emissions of
   PM2.5, BC, formaldehyde, and most VOCs; however, NOx brake specific
   emissions increased. When idling,:the effects of fuel type were
   different: B20 increased NMHC, PM2.5, EC, formaldehyde, benzene, and
   other VOC emission rates from both engines, and changes were sometimes
   large, e.g., PM2.5 increased by 60\% for the 6.4 L/2004 calibration
   engine, and benzene by 40\% for the L engine with the DOC, possibly
   reflecting incomplete combustion and unburned fuel. Diesel exhaust
   emissions depended on the fuel type and engine load (idle versus
   loaded):. The higher emissions found when using B20 are especially
   important given the recent attention to exposures from idling vehicles
   and the health significance of PM2.5. The emission profiles demonstrate
   the effects of fuel type, engine calibration, and emission,control
   system, and they can be used as source profiles for apportionment,
   inventory, and exposure purposes.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon is cycled to and from large reservoirs in the atmosphere, on
   land, and in the ocean. Movement of organic carbon from the terrestrial
   reservoir to the ocean plays an important role in the global cycling of
   carbon. The transition from natural to agricultural vegetation can
   change the storage and movement of organic carbon in and from a
   watershed. Samples were collected from 13 streams located in
   hydrologically and agriculturally diverse watersheds, to better
   understand the variability in the concentrations and loads of dissolved
   organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) in the
   streams, and the variability in watershed yields. The overall annual
   median concentrations of DOG and POC were 4.9 (range: 2.1-6.8) and 1.1
   (range: 0.4-3.8) mg C L-1, respectively. The mean DOG watershed yield
   (+/- SE) was 25 +/- 6.8 kg C ha(-1) yr(-1). The yields of DOC from these
   agricultural watersheds were not substantially different than the DOG
   yield from naturally vegetated watersheds in equivalent biomes, but were
   at the low end of the range for most biomes. Total organic carbon (DOC +
   POC) annually exported from the agricultural watersheds was found to
   average 0.03\% of the organic carbon that is contained in the labile
   plant matter and top 1 m of soil in the watershed. Since the total
   organic carbon exported from agricultural watersheds is a relatively
   small portion of the sequestered carbon within the watershed, there is
   the great potential to store additional carbon in plants and soils of
   the watershed, offsetting some anthropogenic CO2 emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Trajectory conformance monitoring checks whether an aircraft is likely
   to deviate significantly from its contract trajectory in the near
   future. This paper presents a systematic procedure for the design and
   evaluation of probabilistic trajectory conformance monitoring
   algorithms. Basic components of a conformance monitoring system are
   decomposed into trajectory prediction, calculation of deviation metrics,
   and decision logics for declaring nonconformances. Likely causes of
   nonconformances are categorized and stochastic kinematic trajectory
   predictions are used. The deviation metric is defined as the probability
   with which predicted trajectories exceed a containment region around the
   contract trajectory. An algorithm is presented that can estimate the
   nonconformance probability over time for uncertainties with arbitrary
   probabilistic distributions. When this nonconformance probability
   reaches a predefined threshold within the decision interval, a
   nonconformance is declared. In this paper, performances of conformance
   monitoring algorithms are evaluated in terms of rates of false alarm,
   missed detection, correct detection of nonconformance, and correct
   confirmation of conformance. In addition, the advance time from
   detection to occurrence of a nonconformance is also used to measure the
   timeliness of an alert in correct detections. Monte Carlo simulations of
   aircraft level turns are used to systematically study the effects of
   various algorithm parameters on conformance monitoring system
   performances.}},

Abstract = {{Catalytic hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of lignin-derived phenols which are
   the lowest reactive chemical compounds in biomass pyrolysis oils has
   been reviewed. The hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) catalysts have been
   discussed including traditional HDO catalysts such as CoMo/Al2O3 and
   NiMo/Al2O3 catalysts and transition metal catalysts (noble metals). The
   mechanism of HDO of lignin-derived phenols was analyzed on the basis of
   different model compounds. The kinetics of HDO of different
   lignin-derived model compounds has been investigated. The diversity of
   bio-oils leads to the complexities of HDO kinetics. The techno-economic
   analysis indicates that a series of major technical and economical
   efforts still have to be investigated in details before scaling up the
   HDO of lignin-derived phenols in existed refinery infrastructure.
   Examples of future investigation of HDO include significant challenges
   of improving catalysts and optimum operation conditions, further
   understanding of kinetics of complex bio-oils, and the availability of
   sustainable and cost-effective hydrogen source. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A detection scheme for hydrodynamic size distribution of magnetic
   nanoparticles (MNPs) is demonstrated by a mixing-frequency method in
   this paper. MNPs are driven into the saturation region by a low
   frequency sinusoidal magnetic field. A multi-tone high frequency
   sinusoidal magnetic field is then applied to generate mixing-frequency
   signals that are highly specific to the Brownian relaxation of MNPs.
   These highly sensitive mixing-frequency signals from MNPs are picked up
   by a pair of balanced built-in detection coils. The relation between
   MNPs' hydrodynamic size distribution and phase delays of the
   mixing-frequency signals behind the applied field are derived, and are
   experimentally verified. Iron oxide MNPs with the core diameter of 30 nm
   are used for the measurement of Brownian relaxation. The results are
   fitted well with Debye model. This study provides a volume-based
   magnetic sensing scheme for the real-time measurement of MNPs
   hydrodynamic size distribution.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the instantaneous rate maximization and the weighted
   sum delay minimization problems over a K-user multicast channel, where
   multiple antennas are available at the transmitter as well as at all the
   receivers. Motivated by the degree of freedom optimality and the
   simplicity offered by linear precoding schemes, we consider the design
   of linear precoders using the aforementioned two criteria. We first
   consider the scenario wherein the linear precoder can be any
   complex-valued matrix subject to rank and power constraints. We propose
   cyclic alternating ascent based precoder design algorithms and establish
   their convergence to respective stationary points. Simulation results
   reveal that our proposed algorithms considerably outperform known
   competing solutions. We then consider a scenario in which the linear
   precoder can be formed by selecting and concatenating precoders from a
   given finite codebook of precoding matrices, subject to rank and power
   constraints. We show that under this scenario, the instantaneous rate
   maximization problem is equivalent to a robust submodular maximization
   problem which is strongly NP hard. We propose a deterministic
   approximation algorithm and show that it yields a bicriteria
   approximation. For the weighted sum delay minimization problem we
   propose a simple deterministic greedy algorithm, which at each step
   entails approximately maximizing a submodular set function subject to
   multiple knapsack constraints, and establish its performance guarantee.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen and fibrin are important extracellular matrix (ECM) components
   in the body, providing structural integrity to various tissues. These
   biopolymers are also common scaffolds used in tissue engineering. This
   study investigated how co-gelation of collagen and fibrin affected the
   properties of each individual protein network. Collagen-fibrin co-gels
   were cast and subsequently digested using either plasmin or collagenase;
   the microstructure and mechanical behavior of the resulting networks
   were then compared with the respective pure collagen or fibrin gels of
   the same protein concentration. The morphologies of the collagen
   networks were further analyzed via three-dimensional network
   reconstruction from confocal image z-stacks. Both collagen and fibrin
   exhibited a decrease in mean fiber diameter when formed in co-gels
   compared with the pure gels. This microstructural change was accompanied
   by an increased failure strain and decreased tangent modulus for both
   collagen and fibrin following selective digestion of the co-gels. In
   addition, analysis of the reconstructed collagen networks indicated the
   presence of very long fibers and the clustering of fibrils, resulting in
   very high connectivities for collagen networks formed in co-gels. (C)

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the feasibility of using noninvasive EEG
   source imaging approach to image continuous seizure activity in
   pediatric epilepsy patients.
   Methods: Nine pediatric patients with medically intractable epilepsy
   were included in this study. Eight of the patients had extratemporal
   lobe epilepsy and one had temporal lobe epilepsy. All of the patients
   underwent resective surgery and seven of them underwent intracranial EEG
   (iEEG) monitoring. The ictal EEG was analyzed using a noninvasive
   dynamic seizure imaging (DSI) approach. The DSI approach separates scalp
   EEGs into independent components and extracts the spatio-temporal ictal
   features to achieve dynamic imaging of seizure sources. Surgical
   resection and intracranial recordings were used to validate the
   noninvasive imaging results.
   Results: The DSI determined seizure onset zones (SOZs) in these patients
   were localized within or in close vicinity to the surgically resected
   region. In the seven patients with intracranial monitoring, the
   estimated seizure onset sources were concordant with the seizure onset
   zones of iEEG. The DSI also localized the multiple foci involved in the
   later seizure propagation, which were confirmed by the iEEG recordings.
   Conclusions: Dynamic seizure imaging can noninvasively image the seizure
   activations in pediatric patients with both temporal and extratemporal
   lobe epilepsy.
   Significance: EEG seizure imaging can potentially be used to
   noninvasively image the SOZs and aid the pre-surgical planning in
   pediatric epilepsy patients. (C) 2012 International Federation of

Abstract = {{To account for the randomness of propagation channels and interference
   levels in hierarchical spectrum sharing, a novel approach to multihop
   routing is introduced for cognitive random access networks, whereby
   packets are randomly routed according to outage probabilities.
   Leveraging channel and interference level statistics, the resultant
   cross-layer optimization framework provides optimal routes, transmission
   probabilities, and transmit-powers, thus enabling cognizant adaptation
   of routing, medium access, and physical layer parameters to the
   propagation environment. The associated optimization problem is
   non-convex, and hence hard to solve in general. Nevertheless, a
   successive convex approximation approach is adopted to efficiently find
   a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker solution. Augmented Lagrangian and primal
   decomposition methods are employed to develop a distributed algorithm,
   which also lends itself to online implementation. Enticingly, the fresh
   look advocated here permeates benefits also to conventional multihop

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Fast and accurate unveiling of power-line outages is of paramount
   importance not only for preventing faults that may lead to blackouts,
   but also for routine monitoring and control tasks of the smart grid,
   including state estimation and optimal power flow. Existing approaches
   are either challenged by the combinatorial complexity issues involved
   and are thus limited to identifying single and double line-outages or
   they invoke less pragmatic assumptions such as conditionally independent
   phasor angle measurements available across the grid. Using only a subset
   of voltage phasor angle data, the present paper develops a near
   real-time algorithm for identifying multiple line outages at the
   affordable complexity of solving a sparse signal reconstruction problem
   via either greedy steps or coordinate descent iterations. Recognizing
   that the number of line outages is a small fraction of the total number
   of lines, the novel approach relies on reformulating the DC linear power
   flow model as a sparse overcomplete expansion and lever-aging
   contemporary advances in compressive sampling and variable selection.
   This sparse representation can also be extended to incorporate available
   information on the internal system and more general line-parameter
   faults. Analysis and simulated tests on 118-, 300-, and 2383-bus systems
   confirm the effectiveness of identifying sparse power line outages.}},

Abstract = {{The kinetics of ammonia absorption into magnesium chloride is measured
   as ammonia pressure change in the temperature range 170-430 degrees C.
   The actual pressure minus that at equilibrium drops quickly, with a half
   life of less than a minute. It varies with the square-root of time,
   suggesting diffusion limited absorption. The diffusion coefficient of
   ammonia in solid magnesium chloride inferred from these data is on the
   order 10-11-10-13 cm2/s, considerably faster than many solid-phase
   diffusivities. While optical microscopy and BET surface area experiments
   indicate recrystallization and agglomeration of the absorbent at ammonia
   synthesis temperatures, the absorption rate remains high. The dependence
   of absorption rate on temperature, particle size and the presence of a
   silica support is also investigated. The results suggest both improved
   ammonia separation and ways to develop high-conversion, small-scale,
   multifunctional ammonia synthesis reactors. (c) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{One of the challenges in the study of cocontinuous blends is to relate
   their rheological behavior with their morphology. This is due to the
   inherent instability of cocontinuous structures. We have studied the
   morphological and rheological time evolution of cocontinuous blends with
   different interfacial tension and viscosity ratio during annealing. In
   general, the presence of an interface generates an extra contribution to
   the elastic modulus, G'(int). We have found that both the initial value
   of G'(int) and its rate of evolution during coarsening are proportional
   to the ratio between interfacial tension and blend viscosity. We have
   related time evolution of the elastic modulus to that of the interfacial
   area via a simplification of Doi-Ohta model for the case of small
   amplitude oscillatory shear flow. This simplification is based on the
   experimental evidence that the degree of anisotropy generated during
   small amplitude oscillations is negligible {[}Lopez-Barron and Macosko,
   Langmuir 26, 14284-14293 (2010b)]. The simplification gives a linear
   relation between the characteristic size and time and an asymptotic
   decrease of the elastic modulus with a limit behavior at long times:
   G'vertical bar(t ->infinity) proportional to t(-1). This behavior was
   observed on blends with low interfacial tension. However, blends with
   high interfacial tension underwent a transition toward a decrease in the
   rate of coarsening, which is accompanied by a slower decrease of the
   elastic modulus. Doi-Ohta model is not sensitive to this transition and
   fails in predicting the time evolution of the characteristic length and
   elasticity of high interfacial tension blends. (C) 2012 The Society of

Abstract = {{Microwave-Assisted Pyrolysis (MAP) is a highly scalable process that has
   the potential to realize the Distributed Biomass Energy Production
   System (DBEPS) concept. This study was to illustrate the heating
   properties of MAP when applied to biomass, and to demonstrate the
   feasibility of manipulating the heating operation to fully utilize
   exothermic reactions as a means to save energy. Alternate microwave
   heating of corn stover revealed exothermic reactions occurring in
   temperature ranges of 188.4-224.0 degrees C and 367.0-387.0 degrees C.
   These exothermic reactions can potentially sustain the pyrolysis
   reactions in the absence of external heat sources, indicating that
   alternative dielectric heating is a practical energy-saving operation
   mode for MAP. Analysis of the liquid products obtained from different
   heating intervals suggests that it is possible to selectively extract
   the primary pyrolysis products by collecting the condensables at
   specific heating times. The solid chars produced during MAP have
   desirable microwave absorbent properties and could be recycled in the

Abstract = {{For linear models, compressed sensing theory and methods enable recovery
   of sparse signals of interest from few measurements-in the order of the
   number of nonzero entries as opposed to the length of the signal of
   interest. Results of similar flavor have more recently emerged for
   bilinear models, but no results are available for multilinear models of
   tensor data. In this contribution, we consider compressed sensing for
   sparse and low-rank tensors. More specifically, we consider low-rank
   tensors synthesized as sums of outer products of sparse loading vectors,
   and a special class of linear dimensionality-reducing transformations
   that reduce each mode individually. We prove interesting ``oracle{''}
   properties showing that it is possible to identify the uncompressed
   sparse loadings directly from the compressed tensor data. The proofs
   naturally suggest a two-step recovery process: fitting a low-rank model
   in compressed domain, followed by per-mode l(0)/l(1) decompression. This
   two-step process is also appealing from a computational complexity and
   memory capacity point of view, especially for big tensor datasets.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the implementation of Boolean functions by lattices
   of four-terminal switches. Each switch is controlled by a Boolean
   literal. If the literal takes the value 1, the corresponding switch is
   connected to its four neighbors; else it is not connected. A Boolean
   function is implemented in terms of connectivity across the lattice: it
   evaluates to 1 iff there exists a connected path between two opposing
   edges of the lattice. The paper addresses the following synthesis
   problem: how should one assign literals to switches in a lattice in
   order to implement a given target Boolean function? The goal is to
   minimize the lattice size, measured in terms of the number of switches.
   An efficient algorithm for this task is presented-one that does not
   exhaustively enumerate paths but rather exploits the concept of Boolean
   function duality. The algorithm produces lattices with a size that grows
   linearly with the number of products of the target Boolean function in
   ISOP form. It runs in time that grows polynomially. Synthesis trials are
   performed on standard benchmark circuits. The synthesis results are
   compared to a lower-bound calculation on the lattice size.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning techniques for computer vision applications like object
   recognition, scene classification, etc., require a large number of
   training samples for satisfactory performance. Especially when
   classification is to be performed over many categories, providing enough
   training samples for each category is infeasible. This paper describes
   new ideas in multiclass active learning to deal with the training
   bottleneck, making it easier to train large multiclass image
   classification systems. First, we propose a new interaction modality for
   training which requires only yes-no type binary feedback instead of a
   precise category label. The modality is especially powerful in the
   presence of hundreds of categories. For the proposed modality, we
   develop a Value-of-Information (VOI) algorithm that chooses informative
   queries while also considering user annotation cost. Second, we propose
   an active selection measure that works with many categories and is
   extremely fast to compute. This measure is employed to perform a fast
   seed search before computing VOI, resulting in an algorithm that scales
   linearly with dataset size. Third, we use locality sensitive hashing to
   provide a very fast approximation to active learning, which gives
   sublinear time scaling, allowing application to very large datasets. The
   approximation provides up to two orders of magnitude speedups with
   little loss in accuracy. Thorough empirical evaluation of classification
   accuracy, noise sensitivity, imbalanced data, and computational
   performance on a diverse set of image datasets demonstrates the
   strengths of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Gate oxide breakdown is an important reliability issue that has been
   widely studied at the individual transistor level, but has seen very
   little work at the circuit level. We first develop an analytic
   closed-form model for the failure probability (FP) of a large digital
   circuit due to this phenomenon. The new approach accounts for the fact
   that not every breakdown leads to circuit failure, and shows a 4.8-6.2x
   relaxation of the predicted lifetime with respect to the pessimistic
   area-scaling method for nominal process parameters. Next, we extend the
   failure analysis to include the effect of process variations, and derive
   that the circuit FP at a specified time instant has a lognormal
   distribution due to process variations. Circuits with variations show
   19\%-24\% lifetime degradation against nominal analysis and 4.7-5.9x
   life-time relaxation against area-scaling method under variations. Both
   parts of our work are verified by extensive simulations and proved to be
   effective, accurate and scalable.}},

Abstract = {{State-of-the-art timing tools are built around the use of current source
   models (CSMs), which have proven to be fast and accurate in enabling the
   analysis of large circuits. As circuits become increasingly exposed to
   process and temperature variations, there is a strong need to augment
   these models to account for thermal effects and for the impact of
   adaptive body biasing, a compensatory technique that is used to overcome
   on-chip variations. However, a straightforward extension of CSMs to
   incorporate timing analysis at multiple body biases and temperatures
   results in unreasonably large characterization tables for each cell. We
   propose a new approach to compactly capture body bias and temperature
   effects within a mainstream CSM framework. Our approach features a table
   reduction method for compaction of tables and a fast and novel waveform
   sensitivity method for timing evaluation under any body bias and
   temperature condition. On a 45-nm technology, we demonstrate high
   accuracy, with mean errors of under 4\% in both slew and delay as
   compared to HSPICE. We show a speedup of over five orders of magnitude
   over HSPICE and a speedup of about 92x over conventional CSMs.}},

Abstract = {{A popular grade of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) exhibits excellent
   tabletability, but marginal flowability for high-speed tableting
   operations. Accordingly, an enhancement in flowability, while preserving
   its tabletability, will make it a more useful excipient in
   pharmaceutical tablet formulations, especially for the direct
   compression process. In this work, we show that surface coating by
   silica nanoparticles, using either a dry comilling process or simple
   mechanical blending, is a valid strategy for achieving the goal. The
   effects of milling intensity, either the number of comilling cycles or
   blending time, and silica loading level have been evaluated. Results
   show that surface deposition of 0.1\% silica nanoparticles substantially
   improves the flowability of this grade of MCC while preserving a
   significant portion of its tabletability. Higher silica loading leads to
   better flowability, but at the cost of reduced tabletability. However,
   even up to 2.0\% silica deposition, its tabletability remains superior.

Abstract = {{Robust cut-cell algorithms are detailed for general multi-level
   Cartesian grid direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) implementations.
   Different approaches for each component of the cut-cell algorithms are
   elaborated and compared, based on time efficiency, robustness, and ease
   of implementation. Special situations that arise in sorting the surface
   triangles, calculating the cut-cell volume, and identifying multiple
   cut-volumes contained in a single Cartesian cell, are handled by the
   algorithms, and their effects on the overall simulation results are
   analyzed using test cases. Three-dimensional DSMC simulations are
   conducted for a Mach number 20.2 N-2 gas flowing over a Planetary Probe
   geometry showing good agreement with experimental heat flux
   measurements. Rarefied flow over a geometry resembling the MIR Space
   Station is also conducted, to demonstrate the ability of the proposed
   cut-cell algorithms to handle complex geometries. The time required to
   cut the surface meshes from the background Cartesian grids and to
   calculate the volume of the resulting cut-cells is found to be
   comparable to the time cost for one DSMC simulation time step for cases
   considered. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Identification of the biogenic compounds responsible for size-dependent
   nanoparticle growth}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},
Month = {{OCT 30}},
Abstract = {{The probability that freshly nucleated nanoparticles can survive to
   become cloud condensation nuclei is highly sensitive to particle growth
   rates. Much of the growth of newly formed ambient nanoparticles can be
   attributed to oxidized organic vapors originating from biogenic
   precursor gases. In this study we investigated the chemical composition
   of size-selected biogenic nanoparticles in the size range from 10 to 40
   nm. Particles were formed in a flow tube reactor by ozonolysis of
   a-pinene and analyzed with a Thermal Desorption Chemical Ionization Mass
   Spectrometer. While we found similar composition in 10 and 20 nm
   particles, the relative amounts of individual species varied
   significantly when compared to 40 nm particles. Smaller particles (10
   and 20 nm) were characterized by enhancements in carboxylic acids and
   larger particles (40 nm) showed higher concentrations of
   carbonyl-containing compounds and low molecular weight organic acids.
   This composition change from smaller to larger size particles reflects a
   vapor pressure increase of the condensing vapors by 1-2 orders of
   magnitude indicating that the Kelvin effect plays a decisive role in the
   growth of biogenic nanoparticles. Citation: Winkler, P. M., J. Ortega,

Title = {{Coupled dynamics of the co-evolution of gravel bed topography, flow
   turbulence and sediment transport in an experimental channel}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{OCT 27}},
Abstract = {{A series of flume experiments were conducted in a large experimental
   channel at the St. Anthony Falls Laboratory to understand the coupled
   dynamics of flow and bed forms above the sediment-water interface.
   Simultaneous high resolution measurements of velocity fluctuations, bed
   elevations and sediment flux at the downstream end of the channel, were
   made for a range of discharges. The probability density functions (pdfs)
   of bed elevation increments and instantaneous Reynolds stress reveal a
   power law tail behavior and a wavelet cross-correlation analysis depicts
   a strong dependence of these series across a range of scales, indicating
   a feedback between bed form dynamics and near-bed turbulence. These
   results complement our previous findings in which the signature of bed
   form evolution on the near-bed velocity fluctuations was confirmed via
   the presence of a spectral gap and two distinct power law scaling
   regimes in the spectral density of velocity fluctuations. We report
   herein a strong asymmetry in the probability distribution of bed
   elevation increments and instantaneous Reynolds stresses, the latter
   being further analyzed and interpreted via a quadrant analysis of
   velocity fluctuations in the longitudinal and vertical directions. We
   also report the presence of intermittency (multifractality) in bed
   elevation increments and interpret it, in view of the asymmetric nature
   of the pdfs, as the result of scale coupling. In other words, the
   geometric asymmetry at the bed form scale gets transferred down to a
   probabilistic asymmetry at all smaller scales indicating a local
   anisotropy in the energy transfer. Finally, we propose a predictive
   relationship between bed form averaged sediment transport rates and bed
   form averaged instantaneous Reynolds stress and validate it using our
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) are
   programmable nucleases that join FokI endonuclease with the modular
   DNA-binding domain of TALEs. Although zinc-finger nucleases enable a
   variety of genome modifications, their application to genetic
   engineering of livestock has been slowed by technical limitations of
   embryo-injection, culture of primary cells, and difficulty in producing
   reliable reagents with a limited budget. In contrast, we found that
   TALENs could easily be manufactured and that over half (23/36, 64\%)
   demonstrate high activity in primary cells. Cytoplasmic injections of
   TALEN mRNAs into livestock zygotes were capable of inducing gene KO in
   up to 75\% of embryos analyzed, a portion of which harbored biallelic
   modification. We also developed a simple transposon coselection strategy
   for TALEN-mediated gene modification in primary fibroblasts that enabled
   both enrichment for modified cells and efficient isolation of modified
   colonies. Coselection after treatment with a single TALEN-pair enabled
   isolation of colonies with mono-and biallelic modification in up to 54\%
   and 17\% of colonies, respectively. Coselection after treatment with two
   TALEN-pairs directed against the same chromosome enabled the isolation
   of colonies harboring large chromosomal deletions and inversions (10\%
   and 4\% of colonies, respectively). TALEN-modified Ossabaw swine fetal
   fibroblasts were effective nuclear donors for cloning, resulting in the
   creation of miniature swine containing mono-and biallelic mutations of
   the LDL receptor gene as models of familial hypercholesterolemia. TALENs
   thus appear to represent a highly facile platform for the modification
   of livestock genomes for both biomedical and agricultural applications.}},

   Ovalbumin 323-339}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 23}},
Abstract = {{T cell activation requires formation of a tri-molecular interaction
   between a major histocompatibility complex (MHC), peptide, and T cell
   receptor. In a common model system, the ovalbumin epitope 323-339 binds
   the murine class II MHC, I-A(d), in at least three distinct registers.
   The DO11.10 T cell recognizes the least stable of these, as determined
   by peptide-MHC dissociation rates. Using exogenous peptides and peptide
   insertions into a carrier protein in combination with IL-2 secretion
   assays, we show that the alternate registers do not competitively
   inhibit display of the active register four. In contrast, this weakly
   binding register is stabilized by the presence of N-terminal flanking
   residues active in MHC binding. The DO11.10 hybridoma is sensitive to
   the presence of specific wild-type residues extending to at least the
   P-3 peptide position. Transfer of the P-4 to P-2 flanking residues to a
   hen egg lysozyme epitope also presented by I-A(d) increases the activity
   of that epitope substantially. These results illustrate the inherent
   complexity in delineating the interaction of multiple registers based on
   traditional thermodynamic measurements and demonstrate the potential of
   flanking residue modification for increasing the activity of weakly
   bound epitopes. The latter technique represents an alternative to
   substitution of anchor residues within a weakly bound register, which we
   show can significantly decrease the activity of the epitope to a
   responding T cell.}},

Title = {{Role of electronic localization in the phosphorescence of iridium
   sensitizing dyes}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},

Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{In this work we present a systematic study of three representative
   iridium dyes, namely, Ir(ppy)(3), FIrpic, and PQIr, which are commonly
   used as sensitizers in organic optoelectronic devices. We show that
   electronic correlations play a crucial role in determining the
   excited-state energies in these systems, due to localization of
   electrons on Ir d orbitals. Electronic localization is captured by
   employing hybrid functionals within time-dependent density-functional
   theory and with Hubbard-model corrections within the Delta-SCF approach.
   The performance of both methods are studied comparatively and shown to
   be in good agreement with experiment. The Hubbard-corrected functionals
   provide further insight into the localization of electrons and on the
   charge-transfer character of excited-states. The gained insight allows
   us to comment on envisioned functionalization strategies to improve the
   performance of these systems. Complementary discussions on the Delta-SCF
   method are also presented in order to fill some of the gaps in the
   literature. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{The environmental health impacts of transportation depend in part on
   where and when emissions occur during fuel production and combustion.
   Here we describe spatially and temporally explicit life cycle
   inventories (LCI) of air pollutants from gasoline, ethanol derived from
   corn grain, and ethanol from corn stover. Previous modeling for the U.S.
   by Argonne National Laboratory (GREET: Greenhouse Gases, Regulated
   Emissions, and Energy Use in Transportation) suggested that life cycle
   emissions are generally higher for ethanol from corn grain or corn
   stover than for gasoline. Our results show that for ethanol, emissions
   are concentrated in the Midwestern ``Corn Belt{''}. We find that life
   cycle emissions from ethanol exhibit different temporal patterns than
   from gasoline, reflecting seasonal aspects of farming activities.
   Enhanced chemical speciation beyond current GREET model capabilities is
   also described. Life cycle fine particulate matter emissions are higher
   for ethanol from corn grain than for ethanol from corn stover; for black
   carbon, the reverse holds. Overall, our results add to existing
   state-of-the-science transportation fuel LCI by providing spatial and
   temporal disaggregation and enhanced chemical speciation, thereby
   offering greater understanding of the impacts of transportation fuels on
   human health and opening the door to advanced air dispersion modeling of
   fuel life cycles.}},

Abstract = {{Of the 20 amino acids, the precise function of methionine (Met) remains
   among the least well understood. To establish a determining
   characteristic of methionine that fundamentally differentiates it from
   purely hydrophobic residues, we have used in vitro cellular experiments,
   molecular simulations, quantum calculations, and a bioinformatics screen
   of the Protein Data Bank. We show that approximately one-third of all
   known protein structures contain an energetically stabilizing
   Met-aromatic motif and, remarkably, that greater than 10,000 structures
   contain this motif more than 10 times. Critically, we show that as
   compared with a purely hydrophobic interaction, the Metaromatic motif
   yields an additional stabilization of 1-1.5 kcal/mol. To highlight its
   importance and to dissect the energetic underpinnings of this motif, we
   have studied two clinically relevant TNF ligand-receptor complexes,
   namely TRAIL-DR5 and LT alpha-TNFR1. In both cases, we show that the
   motif is necessary for high affinity ligand binding as well as function.
   Additionally, we highlight previously overlooked instances of the motif
   in several disease-related Met mutations. Our results strongly suggest
   that the Met-aromatic motif should be exploited in the rational design
   of therapeutics targeting a range of proteins.}},

Abstract = {{In situ intercalative polymerization is an environmentally-friendly
   process to produce polymer-clay nanocomposites with good clay
   dispersion. In this work, quaternary ammonium salts with tertiary amine
   groups were synthesized to modify clay as catalytically active modifiers

   vermiculites were prepared by ultrasonication and examined by X-ray
   scattering and rheology. In the polyurethane elastomers synthesized from
   the above dispersions in a solvent-free process, X-ray scattering showed
   that the clay was highly intercalated/exfoliated without noticeable
   peaks for d < 9 nm, and TEM images revealed that the local dispersion of
   clay sheets was affected by the structure of the modifier. Addition of
   the modified clay to the polyurethane elastomers had only a small effect
   on the phase separation between hard and soft segments as deduced from
   DSC, FT-IR and DMA results. Thermo-mechanical and barrier properties of
   the composites were evaluated, and with one modifier, the nanocomposites
   showed a 390\% increase in tensile modulus at 25 degrees C and a 40\%
   reduction in CO2 permeability at a loading of 5.3 wt\% of

Abstract = {{We used top-down fabrication techniques to create both an ordered

   of lambda DNA in each of the arrays were obtained as a function of the
   electric field using ensembles of DNA molecules in a double channel
   device that minimizes experimental artifacts. To deepen our
   understanding of the transport, we also used fluorescence microscopy to
   examine the dynamics of single DNA molecules as they interact with the
   arrays at a fixed value of the electric field. Based on the results of
   these two types of experiments, we conclude that the electrophoretic
   mobility is not dependent on the array order but that band broadening in
   the device is greater in the disordered array.}},

Abstract = {{The input and output formats, and the structure of Rule Input Network
   Generator (RING), a computational tool for generation and analysis of
   complex reaction networks, are described with reference to the
   underlying algorithms from Cheminformatics and graph theory. RING
   consists of three modules: (a) a compiler that translates inputs written
   as a program in an English-like reaction language into internal
   representations and instructions, (b) a network generator that
   constructs an exhaustive reaction network from reaction rules and
   initial reactants specified, and (c) a post-processing module that can
   extract pathways, mechanisms, or lumps from the network based on
   user-specified instructions. RING can be used, in a rule-based manner,
   for constructing a large and complex reaction network from a set of
   elementary/overall reaction rules, and for elucidating transformations
   occurring in these networks through identifying pathways and mechanisms
   to specified products. RING is available open under GNU Lesser GPL. (C)

Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{We used an immortalized arachnoid cell line to test the arachnoid
   barrier properties and paracellular transport. The permeabilities of
   urea, mannitol, and inulin through monolayers were 2.9 +/- 1.1 x 10(-6),
   0.8 +/- .18 x 10(-6), 1.0 +/- .29 x 10(-6) cm/s. Size differential
   permeability testing with dextran clarified the arachnoidal
   blood-cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) barrier limit and established a rate of
   transcellular transport to be about two orders of magnitude slower than
   paracellular transport in a polyester membrane diffusion chamber. The
   theoretical pore size for paracellular space is 11 angstrom and the
   occupancy to length ratio is 0.8 and 0.72 cm(-1) for urea and mannitol
   respectively. The permeability of the monolayer was not significantly
   different from apical to basal and vice versa. Gap junctions may have a
   role in contributing to barrier formation. Although the upregulation of
   claudin by dexamethasone did not significantly alter paracellular
   transport, increasing intracellular cAMP decreased mannitol
   permeability. Calcium modulated paracellular transport, but only
   selectively with the ion chelator, EDTA, and with disruption of
   intracellular stores. The blood-CSF barrier at the arachnoid is
   anatomically and physiologically different from the vascular-based
   blood-brain barrier, but is similarly subject to modulation. We describe
   the basic paracellular transport characteristics of this CSF ``sink{''}
   of the brain which will allow for a better description of mass and
   constitutive balance within the intracranial compartment. Published by

Title = {{Increasing Cropping System Diversity Balances Productivity,
   Profitability and Environmental Health}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT 10}},
Abstract = {{Balancing productivity, profitability, and environmental health is a key
   challenge for agricultural sustainability. Most crop production systems
   in the United States are characterized by low species and management
   diversity, high use of fossil energy and agrichemicals, and large
   negative impacts on the environment. We hypothesized that cropping
   system diversification would promote ecosystem services that would
   supplement, and eventually displace, synthetic external inputs used to
   maintain crop productivity. To test this, we conducted a field study
   from 2003-2011 in Iowa that included three contrasting systems varying
   in length of crop sequence and inputs. We compared a conventionally
   managed 2-yr rotation (maize-soybean) that received fertilizers and
   herbicides at rates comparable to those used on nearby farms with two
   more diverse cropping systems: a 3-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small
   grain + red clover) and a 4-yr rotation (maize-soybean-small grain +
   alfalfa-alfalfa) managed with lower synthetic N fertilizer and herbicide
   inputs and periodic applications of cattle manure. Grain yields, mass of
   harvested products, and profit in the more diverse systems were similar
   to, or greater than, those in the conventional system, despite
   reductions of agrichemical inputs. Weeds were suppressed effectively in
   all systems, but freshwater toxicity of the more diverse systems was two
   orders of magnitude lower than in the conventional system. Results of
   our study indicate that more diverse cropping systems can use small
   amounts of synthetic agrichemical inputs as powerful tools with which to
   tune, rather than drive, agroecosystem performance, while meeting or
   exceeding the performance of less diverse systems.}},

Journal = {{MACROMOLECULES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{45}},
Number = {{19}},
Pages = {{7778-7782}},
Month = {{OCT 9}},
Abstract = {{A heterogeneous Pt-Re/SiO2 catalyst was used to perform H-D exchange
   reactions on the linear saturated polyolefins poly(ethylene),
   poly(ethylene-alt-propylene), and isotactic poly(propylene) in the
   saturated hydrocarbon solvents decalin, decane, heptane, and isooctane.
   Exchange reactions using deuterium gas were selective toward the polymer
   in the case of linear and branched alkane solvents for poly(ethylene)
   and poly(ethylene-alt-propylene), whereas reactions conducted in decalin
   result in virtually no isotope exchange with the polymer. Essentially,
   no exchange occurred with poly(propylene) in either linear (decane) or
   branched (isooctane) solvents. In all cases, polymer backbone bonds were
   unperturbed, preserving the molecular weight distribution. These results
   suggest that competitive adsorption between the polymer and solvent
   plays a significant role in heterogeneous catalysis of polymers.
   Furthermore, this strategy provides a simple and efficient method for
   postsynthesis labeling selected polyolefins with deuterium, for example,
   for use in small-angle neutron scattering.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple studies have indicated that the TET oxidases and, more
   controversially, the activation-induced cytidine deaminase/APOBEC
   deaminases have the capacity to convert genomic DNA5-methylcytosine
   (MeC) into altered nucleobases that provoke excision repair and
   culminate in the replacement of the original MeC with a normal cytosine
   (C). We show that human APOBEC3A (A3A) efficiently deaminates both MeC
   to thymine (T) and normal C to uracil (U) in single-stranded DNA
   substrates. In comparison, the related enzyme APOBEC3G (A3G) has
   undetectable MeC to T activity and 10-fold less C to U activity. Upon
   100-fold induction of endogenous A3A by interferon, the MeC status of
   bulk chromosomal DNA is unaltered, whereas both MeC and C nucleobases in
   transfected plasmid DNA substrates are highly susceptible to editing.
   Knockdown experiments show that endogenous A3A is the source of both of
   these cellular DNA deaminase activities. This is the first evidence for
   nonchromosomal DNA MeC to T editing in human cells. These biochemical
   and cellular data combine to suggest a model in which the expanded
   substrate versatility of A3A may be an evolutionary adaptation that
   occurred to fortify its innate immune function in foreign DNA clearance
   by myeloid lineage cell types.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the long-term environmental stability of the
   photoluminescent (PL) properties of silicon nanocrystals (SiNCs). We
   prepared sulfur hexafluoride. (SF6) etched SiNCs in a two-stage plasma
   reactor and investigated their PL stability against UV irradiation in
   air. Unlike SiNCs with hydrogen-passivated surfaces, the SF6-etched
   SiNCs exhibit no photobleaching upon extended UV irradiation despite
   surface oxidation. Furthermore, the PL quantum yield also remains stable
   upon heating the SF6-etched SiNCs up to 160 degrees C. The observed
   thermal and UV stability of SF6-etched SiNCs combined with their PL
   quantum yields of up to similar to 50\% make them attractive candidates
   for UV downshifting to enhance the efficiency of solar cells. Electron
   paramagnetic spin resonance indicates that the SF6-etched SiNCs have a
   lowered density of defect states, both as-formed and after room
   temperature oxidation in air.}},

Abstract = {{The topological effect of noncrossability of long flexible
   macromolecules is effectively described by a slip-spring model, which
   represents entanglements by local, pairwise, translationally invariant
   interactions that do not alter any equilibrium properties. We
   demonstrate that the model correctly describes many aspects of the
   dynamical and rheological behavior of entangled polymer liquids, such as
   segmental mean-square displacements and shear thinning, in a
   computationally efficient manner. Furthermore, the model can account for
   the reduction of entanglements under shear.}},

Abstract = {{Lipid bilayer membranes found in nature are heterogeneous mixtures of
   lipids and proteins. Model systems, such as supported lipid bilayers
   (SLBs), are often employed to simplify experimental systems while
   mimicking the properties of natural lipid bilayers. Here, we demonstrate
   a new method to form SLB arrays by first forming spherical supported
   lipid bilayers (SSLBs) on submicrometer-diameter SiO2 beads. The SSLBs
   are then arrayed into microwells using a simple physical assembly method
   that requires no chemical modification of the substrate nor modification
   of the lipid membrane with recognition moieties. The resulting arrays
   have submicrometer SSLBs with 3 mu m periodicity where >75\% of the
   microwells are occupied by an individual SSLB. Because the arrays have
   high density, fluorescence from >1000 discrete SSLBs can be acquired
   with a single image capture. We show that 2-component random arrays can
   be formed, and we also use the arrays to determine the equilibrium
   dissociation constant for cholera toxin binding to ganglioside GM1. SSLB
   arrays are robust and are stable for at least one week in buffer.}},

Title = {{Multichannel cavity optomechanics for all-optical amplification of radio
   frequency signals}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{3}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Optomechanical phenomena in photonic devices provide a new means of
   light-light interaction mediated by optical force actuated mechanical
   motion. In cavity optomechanics, this interaction can be enhanced
   significantly to achieve strong interaction between optical signals in
   chip-scale systems, enabling all-optical signal processing without
   resorting to electro-optical conversion or nonlinear materials. However,
   current implementation of cavity optomechanics achieves both excitation
   and detection only in a narrow band at the cavity resonance. This
   bandwidth limitation would hinder the prospect of integrating cavity
   optomechanical devices in broadband photonic systems. Here we
   demonstrate a new configuration of cavity optomechanics that includes
   two separate optical channels and allows broadband readout of
   optomechanical effects. The optomechanical interaction achieved in this
   device can induce strong but controllable nonlinear effects, which can
   completely dominate the device's intrinsic mechanical properties.
   Utilizing the device's strong optomechanical interaction and its
   multichannel configuration, we further demonstrate all-optical,
   wavelength-multiplexed amplification of radio-frequency signals.}},

Abstract = {{The effects effects of deep brain stimulation (DBS) on motor cortex
   circuitry in Essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) patients
   are not well understood, in part, because most imaging modalities have
   difficulty capturing and localizing motor cortex dynamics on the same
   temporal scale as motor symptom expression. Here, we report on the use
   of magnetoencephalography (MEG) to characterize sources of postural
   tremor activity within the brain of an ET/PD patient and the effects of
   bilateral subthalamic nucleus DBS on these sources. Recordings were
   performed during unilateral and bilateral DBS at stimulation amplitudes
   of 0 V, 1 V, and 3 V corresponding to no therapy, subtherapeutic, and
   therapeutic configurations, respectively. Dipole source localization in
   reference to the postural tremor frequency recorded with
   electromyography (EMG) showed prominent sources in both right and left
   motor cortices when no therapy was provided. These sources dissipated as
   the amplitude of stimulation increased to a therapeutic level (P =
   0.0062). Coherence peaks between the EMG and MEG recordings were seen at
   both 4 Hz, postural tremor frequency, and at 8 Hz, twice the tremor
   frequency, with no therapy. Both peaks were reduced with therapeutic
   DBS. These results demonstrate the capabilities of MEG to record
   cortical dynamics of tremor during deep brain stimulation and suggest
   that MEG could be used to examine DBS in the context of motor symptoms
   of PD and of ET. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we have designed, fabricated, and tested an all-optical
   ultrasound transducer by integrating a photoabsorptive polyimide thin
   film into a Fabry-Perot (etalon) high-frequency receiver. A 5-ns UV
   pulse was used for thermoelastic ultrasound generation in the polyimide
   film, and the transmission had a maximum amplitude of 4.3 MPa centered
   at 27 MHz with a fractional bandwidth of 107\%. The device attained a
   noise-equivalent pressure of 1.3 Pa/root Hz in receive-only mode. When
   used in pulse-echo mode, the -6-dB upper cutoff frequency of the
   transmit/receive response reached 47 MHz. Basic imaging capabilities
   were also investigated by scanning the near-infrared probe beam across
   the device to create a 2 x 2 mm synthetic aperture. The imaging of
   targets placed at depths of 1.8 and 5.2 mm yielded estimates of 71 and
   145 mu m, respectively, for the lateral resolution and 35 and 38 mu m,
   respectively, for the axial resolution. Finally, a design concept for a
   forward-viewing intravascular imager is presented that entails the
   coupling of light to a rotating, linear array of optical fibers on top
   of which are deposited polyimideetalon transducers. Such a design would
   allow for a flexible and compact high-resolution imager well-suited for
   intravascular applications, such as guidance of treatment in the case of
   chronic total occlusion.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer Bragg grating waveguides (BGWs) are demonstrated as ultrasound
   detectors. The device is fabricated by a direct electron beam
   lithography technique using an epoxy-based photoresist as the core
   material, with grating features fabricated on the side walls of the rib

   the device, which can be used in a linear array, facilitating
   high-frequency ultrasound imaging. The fabricated BGW device has a
   cross-sectional area of 1.5 x 1.5 mu m and the grating length is 500 mu
   m. The optical resonance spectrum is measured and compared with a
   theoretical model. The BGW device is experimentally demonstrated for the
   detection of ultrasound waves emitted by a 25-MHz transducer. Detection
   sensitivity depends on optimal grating design for a steep resonance. The
   extension of a single-element BGW device to a linear array using optical
   wavelength division multiplexing is presented. The results demonstrate

Title = {{Molecular dynamics simulation of rotational relaxation in nitrogen:
   Implications for rotational collision number models}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Abstract = {{We study the rotational relaxation process in nitrogen using all-atom
   molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and direct simulation Monte Carlo
   (DSMC). The intermolecular model used in the MD simulations is shown to
   (i) reproduce very well the shear viscosity of nitrogen over a wide
   range of temperatures, (ii) predict the near-equilibrium rotational
   collision number in good agreement with published trajectory
   calculations done on ab initio potential energy surfaces, and (iii)
   produce shock wave profiles in excellent accordance with the
   experimental measurements. We find that the rotational relaxation
   process is dependent not only on the near-equilibrium temperature (i.
   e., when systems relax to equilibrium after a small perturbation), but
   more importantly on both the magnitude and direction of the initial
   deviation from the equilibrium state. The comparison between MD and
   DSMC, based on the Borgnakke-Larsen model, for shock waves (both at low
   and high temperatures) and one-dimensional expansions shows that a
   judicious choice of a constant Z(rot) can produce DSMC results which are
   in relatively good agreement with MD. However, the selection of the
   rotational collision number is case-specific, depending not only on the
   temperature range, but more importantly on the type of flow (compression
   or expansion), with significant limitations for more complex simulations
   characterized both by expansion and compression zones. Parker's model,
   parametrized for nitrogen, overpredicts Z(rot) for temperatures above
   about 300 K. It is also unable to describe the dependence of the
   relaxation process on the direction to equilibrium. Finally, we present
   a demonstrative cell-based formulation of a rotational relaxation model
   to illustrate how, by including the key physics obtained from the MD
   data (dependence of the relaxation process on both the rotational and
   the translational state of the gas), the agreement between MD and DSMC
   solutions is drastically improved. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{Temporal lobe seizures have a significant chance to induce impairment of
   normal brain functions. Even after the termination of ictal discharges,
   during the post-ictal period, loss of consciousness, decreased
   responsiveness or other cognitive dysfunctions can persist. Previous
   studies have found various anatomical and functional abnormalities
   accompanying temporal lobe seizures, including an abnormal elevation of
   cortical slow waves. Intracranial electroencephalography studies have
   shown a prominent increase of lower frequency components during and
   following seizures that impair (complex partial seizures) but not those
   that preserve (simple partial seizures) normal consciousness and
   responsiveness. However, due to the limited spatial coverage of
   intracranial electroencephalography, the investigation of cortical slow
   waves cannot be easily extended to the whole brain. In this study, we
   used scalp electroencephalography to study the spectral features and
   spatial distribution of post-ictal slow waves with comprehensive spatial
   coverage. We studied simple partial, complex partial and secondarily
   generalized seizures in 28 patients with temporal lobe seizures. We used
   dense-array electroencephalography and source imaging to reconstruct the
   post-ictal slow-wave distribution. In the studied cohort, we found that
   a `global' spectral power shift to lower frequencies accompanied the
   increased severity of seizures. The delta spectral power relative to
   higher frequency bands was highest for secondarily generalized seizures,
   followed by complex partial seizures and lastly simple partial seizures.
   In addition to this `global' spectral shift, we found a `regional'
   spatial shift in slow-wave activity. Secondarily generalized seizures
   and complex partial seizures exhibited increased slow waves distributed
   to frontal areas with spread to contralateral temporal and parietal
   regions than in simple partial seizures. These results revealed that a
   widespread cortical network including temporal and fronto-parietal
   cortex is involved in abnormal slow-wave activity following temporal
   lobe seizures. The differential spectral and spatial shifts of
   post-ictal electroencephalography activity in simple partial, complex
   partial and secondarily generalized seizures suggest a possible
   connection between cortical slow waves and behavioural and cognitive
   changes in a human epilepsy model.}},

Abstract = {{The photoselective vaporization of prostate (PVP) green light (532 nm)
   laser is increasingly being used as an alternative to the transurethral
   resection of prostate (TURP) for treatment of benign prostatic
   hyperplasia (BPH) in older patients and those who are poor surgical
   candidates. In order to achieve the goals of increased tissue removal
   volume (i.e., ``ablation{''} in the engineering sense) and reduced
   collateral thermal damage during the PVP green light treatment, a two
   dimensional computational model for laser tissue ablation based on
   available parameters in the literature has been developed and compared
   to experiments. The model is based on the control volume finite
   difference and the enthalpy method with a mechanistically defined energy
   necessary to ablate (i.e., physically remove) a volume of tissue (i.e.,
   energy of ablation E-ab). The model was able to capture the general
   trends experimentally observed in terms of ablation and coagulation
   areas, their ratio (therapeutic index (TI)), and the ablation rate (AR)
   (mm(3)/s). The model and experiment were in good agreement at a smaller
   working distance (WD) (distance from the tissue in mm) and a larger
   scanning speed (SS) (laser scan speed in mm/s). However, the model and
   experiment deviated somewhat with a larger WD and a smaller SS; this is
   most likely due to optical shielding and heat diffusion in the laser
   scanning direction, which are neglected in the model. This model is a
   useful first step in the mechanistic prediction of PVP based BPH laser
   tissue ablation. Future modeling efforts should focus on optical
   shielding, heat diffusion in the laser scanning direction (i.e.,
   including 3D effects), convective heat losses at the tissue boundary,
   and the dynamic optical, thermal, and coagulation properties of BPH
   tissue. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007452]}},

Abstract = {{An energy-bin-based coupling model for recombination is derived for
   high-enthalpy nozzle flows using oxygen as the test gas. The coupling
   between vibrational and rotational modes is taken into account by the
   use of energy bins. A prior recombination distribution of molecules,
   dependent on the total energy available to a recombining system, is
   obtained using information theory. The low-lying electronically excited
   states of oxygen are also considered. The energy levels are obtained
   assuming the oxygen molecules behave as Morse oscillators. The results
   from a state-specific model are used to compare with the energy-bin
   approach. The energy-bin approach using only the ground state of the
   oxygen molecule predicts similar conditions at the nozzle test section
   as the state-specific model. The inclusion of the excited electronic
   states in the energy-bin approach calculations produces test section
   conditions with significant chemical nonequilibrium and also predicts
   nontrivial concentrations of the electronically excited states. The
   effect of energy bias in the initial recombination distribution and the
   sensitivity of the test section conditions to the interbin rate
   constants are also investigated.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the categorization of human diseases is critical for
   reliably identifying disease causal genes. Recently, genome-wide studies
   of abnormal chromosomal locations related to diseases have mapped > 2000
   phenotype-gene relations, which provide valuable information for
   classifying diseases and identifying candidate genes as drug targets. In
   this article, a regularized non-negative matrix tri-factorization
   (R-NMTF) algorithm is introduced to co-cluster phenotypes and genes, and
   simultaneously detect associations between the detected phenotype
   clusters and gene clusters. The R-NMTF algorithm factorizes the
   phenotype-gene association matrix under the prior knowledge from
   phenotype similarity network and protein-protein interaction network,
   supervised by the label information from known disease classes and
   biological pathways. In the experiments on disease phenotype-gene
   associations in OMIM and KEGG disease pathways, R-NMTF significantly
   improved the classification of disease phenotypes and disease pathway
   genes compared with support vector machines and Label Propagation in
   cross-validation on the annotated phenotypes and genes. The newly
   predicted phenotypes in each disease class are highly consistent with
   human phenotype ontology annotations. The roles of the new member genes
   in the disease pathways are examined and validated in the
   protein-protein interaction subnetworks. Extensive literature review
   also confirmed many new members of the disease classes and pathways as
   well as the predicted associations between disease phenotype classes and
   pathways.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},

Number = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The accepted wisdom is that combinational circuits must have acyclic
   (i.e., feed-forward) topologies. Yet simple examples suggest that this
   is incorrect. In fact, introducing cycles (i.e., feedback) into
   combinational designs can lead to significant savings in area and in
   delay. Prior work described methodologies for synthesizing cyclic
   circuits with Sum-Of-Product (SOP) and Binary-Decision Diagram
   (BDD)-based formulations. Recently, techniques for analyzing and mapping
   cyclic circuits based on Boolean satisfiability (SAT) were proposed.
   This article presents a SAT-based methodology for synthesizing cyclic
   dependencies. The strategy is to generate cyclic functional dependencies
   through a technique called Craig interpolation. Given a choice of
   different functional dependencies, a branch-and-bound search is
   performed to pick the best one. Experiments on benchmark circuits
   demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{With a template-stripping fabrication technique, we demonstrate the mass

   reprodudble single-molecule imaging with sub-20-nm spatial resolution
   and an enhancement in the detected fluorescence signal of up to 200.
   Similar results are obtained for TERS imaging of carbon nanotubes. We
   show that the large apex angle (70.5 degrees) of our pyramidal tip is
   well suited to scatter the near-field optical signal into the far-field,
   leading to larger emission enhancement and hen:e to a larger quantum
   yield. Each gold or silver pyramidal probe is used on-demand, one at a
   time, and the unused tips can be stored for extended times without
   degradation or contamination. The high yield (> 95\%), reproducibility,
   durability, and massively parallel fabrication (15 million identical

Abstract = {{Understanding how the mechanical behaviour of materials deviates at the
   nanoscale from the macroscopically established concepts is a key
   challenge of particular importance for graphene, given the complex
   interplay between its nanoscale morphology and electronic
   properties(1-5). In this work, the (sub) nanometre-wavelength periodic
   rippling of suspended graphene nanomembranes has been realized by
   thermal strain engineering and investigated using scanning tunnelling
   microscopy. This allows us to explore the rippling of a crystalline
   membrane with wavelengths comparable to its lattice constant. The
   observed nanorippling mode violates the predictions of the continuum
   model(6), and evidences the breakdown of the plate idealization(7) of
   the graphene monolayer. Nevertheless, microscopic simulations based on a
   quantum mechanical description of the chemical binding accurately
   describe the observed rippling mode and elucidate the origin of the
   continuum model breakdown. Spatially resolved tunnelling spectroscopy
   measurements indicate a substantial influence of the nanoripples on the
   local electronic structure of graphene and reveal the formation of
   one-dimensional electronic superlattices.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{In the past, applying formal analysis, such as model checking, to
   industrial problems required a team of formal methods experts and a
   great deal of effort. Model checking has become popular, because model
   checkers have evolved to allow domain-experts, who lack model checking
   expertise, to analyze their systems. What made this shift possible and
   what roles did models play in this? That is the main question we
   consider here. We survey approaches that transform domain-specific input
   models into alternative forms that are invisible to the user and which
   are amenable to model checking using existing techniques-we refer to
   these as hidden models. We observe that keeping these models hidden from
   the user is in fact paramount to the success of the domain-specific
   model checker. We illustrate the value of hidden models by surveying
   successful examples of their use in different areas of model checking
   (hardware and software) and how a lack of suitable models hamper a new
   area (biological systems).}},

Abstract = {{Using increased proportions of Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement (RAP) in
   asphalt pavements construction has become a top priority due to
   significant economic and environmental benefits. A similar trend has
   also emerged in Recycled Asphalt Shingles (RAS), which represent the
   main roofing Material in US. In this paper, the effect of adding RAP and
   RAS on low temperature properties of asphalt mixtures is investigated
   using microstructural analysis and modeling of rheological data obtained
   on eight asphalt mixtures. Detailed information on internal
   microstructure of asphalt mixtures is obtained from digital images of
   asphalt mixtures beams and numerical estimations of spatial correlation
   functions. It is found that that microstructure spatial distribution is
   not affected by RAP and RAS addition. Mechanical analog (Sharpe, 2008
   {[}18]) and semi empirical models are used to back-calculate binder
   creep stiffness from mixture experimental data. Differences between
   back-calculated results and experimental data suggest blending between
   new and old binder may be only partial. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Journal = {{FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{498-512}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Working as an ensemble method that establishes a committee of
   classifiers first and then aggregates their outcomes through majority
   voting, bagging has attracted considerable research interest and been
   applied in various application domains. It has demonstrated several
   advantages, but in its present form, bagging has been found to be less
   accurate than some other ensemble methods. To unlock its power and
   expand its user base, we propose an approach that improves bagging
   through the use of multi-algorithm ensembles. In a multi-algorithm
   ensemble, multiple classification algorithms are employed. Starting from
   a study of the nature of diversity, we show that compared to using
   different training sets alone, using heterogeneous algorithms together
   with different training sets increases diversity in ensembles, and hence
   we provide a fundamental explanation for research utilizing
   heterogeneous algorithms. In addition, we partially address the problem
   of the relationship between diversity and accuracy by providing a
   non-linear function that describes the relationship between diversity
   and correlation. Furthermore, after realizing that the bootstrap
   procedure is the exclusive source of diversity in bagging, we use
   heterogeneity as another source of diversity and propose an approach
   utilizing heterogeneous algorithms in bagging. For evaluation, we
   consider several benchmark data sets from various application domains.
   The results indicate that, in terms of F1-measure, our approach
   outperforms most of the other state-of-the-art ensemble methods
   considered in experiments and, in terms of mean margin, our approach is
   superior to all the others considered in experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Timing compensation between the clock period and datapath delay in the
   presence of resonant supply noise has drawn a great deal of attention
   from the circuit design community. This effect, which is often referred
   to as the clock data compensation effect, manifests itself as an
   increase in maximum operating frequency for high performance
   microprocessors. In this work, we propose an adaptive phase-shifting PLL
   that can achieve optimal clock data compensation by digitally
   programming the supply noise sensitivity and the phase shift of the PLL
   clock period. Measurement results from a 1.2 V, 65 nm test chip
   demonstrate a 3.4-7.3\% improvement in the maximum operating frequency
   across different clock distribution designs and resonant frequencies. A
   mathematical framework for simulating the performance of the adaptive
   phase-shifting PLL is presented for better insight on how the proposed
   PLL performs when used in different clock network configurations. In
   addition, the impact of the proposed technique on PLL stability as well
   as its effectiveness in a 32 nm process has been explored.}},

Abstract = {{We present a mobile multi-touch interface for selecting, querying, and
   visually exploring data visualized on large, high-resolution displays.
   Although emerging large (e.g., similar to 10 m wide), high-resolution
   displays provide great potential for visualizing dense, complex
   datasets, their utility is often limited by a fundamental interaction
   problem - the need to interact with data from multiple positions around
   a large room. Our solution is a selection and querying interface that
   combines a hand-held multi-touch device with 6 degree-of-freedom
   tracking in the physical space that surrounds the large display. The
   interface leverages context from both the user's physical position in
   the room and the current data being visualized in order to interpret
   multi-touch gestures. It also utilizes progressive refinement, favoring
   several quick approximate gestures as opposed to a single complex input
   in order to most effectively map the small mobile multi-touch input
   space to the large display wall. The approach is evaluated through two
   interdisciplinary visualization applications: a multi-variate data
   visualization for social scientists, and a visual database querying tool
   for biochemistry. The interface was effective in both scenarios, leading
   to new domain-specific insights and suggesting valuable guidance for
   future developers. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{PLASMA SOURCES SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Sectional models of the dynamics of aerosol populations are well
   established in the aerosol literature but have received relatively less
   attention in numerical models of dusty plasmas, where most modeling
   studies have assumed the existence of monodisperse dust particles. In
   the case of plasmas in which nanoparticles nucleate and grow,
   significant polydispersity can exist in particle size distributions, and
   stochastic charging can cause particles of given size to have a broad
   distribution of charge states. Sectional models, while computationally
   expensive, are well suited to treating such distributions. This paper
   presents an overview of sectional modeling of nanodusty plasmas, and

Abstract = {{A small-scale Mach 5 blowdown wind tunnel has been developed to generate
   steady-state nonequilibrium flows. The wind tunnel uses transverse
   nanosecond pulse discharge, overlapped with transverse dc discharge, to
   load internal energy modes of N-2 and O-2 in plenum. The stable
   discharge is operated at high plenum pressures, at energy loadings of up
   to similar to 0.1 e V/molecu le in nitrogen, generating nonequilibrium
   nitrogen and airflows with run time of 5-10 s, translational/rotational
   temperature of T-0 similar to 300-400 K, and N-2 vibrational temperature
   of up to T-v0 similar to 2000 K. Internal energy-mode disequilibrium is
   controlled by injecting O-2, NO, H-2, or CO2 into the subsonic flow
   between the discharge and the nozzle throat. Flow over a cylinder model
   in a Mach 5 test section is visualized by schlieren imaging and NO
   planar laser-induced fluorescence imaging, using a burst-mode laser
   operated near 226 nm, at a pulse-repetition rate of 10-20 kHz. NO planar
   laser-induced fluorescence images on two single-line NO(X, v' = 0 -> A,
   v `' = 0) transitions are used to infer rotational temperature
   distributions in NO-seeded nitrogen flows in the supersonic section,
   with and without discharge. Single-line NO planar laser-induced
   fluorescence images on a NO(X, v' = 1 -> A, v `' = 1) transition are
   used to infer the NO vibrational temperature in a nitrogen Mach 5 flow
   excited by the discharge and seeded with NO. The results are compared to
   three-dimensional nonequilbrium flow modeling calculations, showing good
   agreement.}},

Abstract = {{Tomographic particle image velocimetry (PIV) is a recently developed
   method to measure three components of velocity within a volumetric
   space. We present a visual hull technique that automates identification
   and masking of discrete objects within the measurement volume, and we
   apply existing tomographic PIV reconstruction software to measure the
   velocity surrounding the objects. The technique is demonstrated by
   considering flow around falling bodies of different shape with Reynolds
   number similar to 1,000. Acquired image sets are processed using
   separate routines to reconstruct both the volumetric mask around the
   object and the surrounding tracer particles. After particle
   reconstruction, the reconstructed object mask is used to remove any
   ghost particles that otherwise appear within the object volume. Velocity
   vectors corresponding with fluid motion can then be determined up to the
   boundary of the visual hull without being contaminated or affected by
   the neighboring object velocity. Although the visual hull method is not
   meant for precise tracking of objects, the reconstructed object volumes
   nevertheless can be used to estimate the object location and orientation
   at each time step.}},

Abstract = {{While collagen is recognized as the predominant mechanical component of
   soft connective tissues, the role of the non-fibrillar matrix (NFM) is
   less well understood. Even model systems, such as the collagen-agarose
   co-gel, can exhibit complex behavior, making it difficult to identify
   relative contributions of specific tissue constituents. In the present
   study, we developed a two-component microscale model of collagen-agarose
   tissue analogs and used it to elucidate the interaction between collagen
   and NFM in uniaxial tension. Collagen fibers were represented with
   Voronoi networks, and the NFM was modeled as a neo-Hookean solid. Model
   predictions of total normal stress and Poisson's ratio matched
   experimental observations well (including high Poisson's values of
   similar to 3), and the addition of NFM led to composition-dependent
   decreases in volume change and increases in fiber stretch. Because the
   NFM was more resistant to volume change than the fiber network,
   extension of the composite led to pressurization of the NFM. Within a
   specific range of parameter values (low shear modulus and moderate
   Poisson's ratio), the magnitude of the reaction force decreased relative
   to this pressurization component resulting in a negative (compressive)
   NFM stress in the loading direction, even though the composite tissue
   was in tension.}},

Abstract = {{The discovery of spin crossovers in iron under pressure in
   ferropericlase and iron-bearing magnesium silicate perovskite, the major
   mineral phases of the Earth's lower mantle, ignited in the last eight
   years intense discussions on the nature of this phenomenon and potential
   effects on the state and evolution of the Earth's mantle and of the
   planet as a whole. The nature of spin crossover in ferropericlase is
   better understood, and consensus on the interpretation of experimental
   data has been essentially achieved. However, in perovskite numerous
   experiments and computations have been carried out, often giving
   different results or suggesting different interpretations. Perovskite is
   a much more challenging system to investigate for a couple of reasons:
   there are two types of iron, ferrous (Fe2+) and ferric (Fe3+), more than
   one site can be occupied by iron, the A and B perovskite sites (as in
   ABX(3)), and experiments do not probe the spin state unambiguously.
   Calculations are also especially difficult. This type of problem has
   challenged condensed matter theorists for decades. In addition, novel
   density functional theory + Hubbard U (DFT+U) electronic structure
   techniques, sometimes previously untested, are being used to address
   this type of problem. In summary, the challenge is multi-faceted. Here
   we review a series of calculations that have succeeded in reproducing
   experimental data and have been essential for their interpretation. They
   used the recently developed DFT+Usc method where the Hubbard U is
   obtained self-consistently by first principles. In particular, the
   electric field gradients (EFGs) at the nucleus of iron and thus
   quadrupole splittings (QSs) have been successfully computed, making
   direct comparisons between measured (via Mossbauer spectroscopy) and
   computed QSs for various spin states possible. This strategy led to
   unexpected findings in (Mg1-xFex)SiO3 and in (Mg1-xFex)(Si1-xFex)O-3 (x
   = 0.125): in the pressure range of the lower mantle a) ferrous iron in
   the A site undergoes a site change, not a spin-state change and b) in
   ferric iron, spin crossover happens only in the B-site.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulation is used to increase the knowledge base for failure
   of instrumentation or control cables utilized in the nuclear power
   industry subjected to an industrial fire. The model used for the
   simulation includes the electrical core of the conductors, the

   cables in present use in the nuclear industry are investigated. The
   focus of the work is to determine the time at which a cable ceases to
   perform. That time is based on a definition provided by NUREG/CR-6931:
   Cable Response to Live Fire. It was found that the time to failure is
   well correlated with the thermal mass per unit length of the cable. The
   correlating equation, useful for interpolation is, Time to
   failure=(1376) (total thermal mass per unit length)+ 111. In this
   equation, the time to failure is in seconds, and the thermal mass per
   unit length, defined in Eq. (4), has units of kilojoules per degree
   Kelvin per meter. When comparing the numerical simulation to
   experimentation reported in NUREG/CR-6931: Cable Response to Live Fire,

Number = {{10}},

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis (PCA) is widely used for dimensionality
   reduction, with well-documented merits in various applications involving
   high-dimensional data, including computer vision, preference
   measurement, and bioinformatics. In this context, the fresh look
   advocated here permeates benefits from variable selection and
   compressive sampling, to robustify PCA against outliers. A least-trimmed
   squares estimator of a low-rank bilinear factor analysis model is shown
   closely related to that obtained from an -(pseudo) norm-regularized
   criterion encouraging sparsity in l(0)a matrix explicitly modeling the
   outliers. This connection suggests robust PCA schemes based on convex
   relaxation, which lead naturally to a family of robust estimators
   encompassing Huber's optimal M-class as a special case. Outliers are
   identified by tuning a regularization parameter, which amounts to
   controlling sparsity of the outlier matrix along the whole
   robustification path of (group) least-absolute shrinkage and selection
   operator (Lasso) solutions. Beyond its ties to robust statistics, the
   developed outlier-aware PCA framework is versatile to accommodate novel
   and scalable algorithms to: i) track the low-rank signal subspace
   robustly, as new data are acquired in real time; and ii) determine
   principal components robustly in (possibly) infinite-dimensional feature
   spaces. Synthetic and real data tests corroborate the effectiveness of
   the proposed robust PCA schemes, when used to identify aberrant
   responses in personality assessment surveys, as well as unveil
   communities in social networks, and intruders from video surveillance
   data.}},

Abstract = {{We examine in this work a model problem relevant to the liquid
   displacement that occurs in lithographic printing processes. The model
   problem consists of two stratified thin liquid films confined between
   parallel plates, one of which is chemically heterogeneous. The films are
   assumed to be thin enough so that intermolecular forces are important
   and the lubrication approximation can be invoked. Both linear stability
   analysis and nonlinear simulations are applied to a partial differential
   equation governing the behavior of the liquid-liquid interface. The
   results provide physical insights into and numerical estimates of the
   smallest and largest feature sizes that can be printed, as well as the
   minimum spacing between feature sizes that can be tolerated. The results
   also provide insight into experimental observations on a closely related
   process, wire-wound rod coating on chemically patterned surfaces. The
   work presented here has important implications for the production of
   electronic devices and displays by lithographic printing, as well as for
   other processes that rely on coating and printing on chemically

Abstract = {{Johnson and Prud'homme (2003. AICHE J 49:22642282) introduced the
   confined impingement jets (CIJ) mixer to prepare nanoparticles loaded
   with hydrophobic compounds (e.g., drugs, inks, fragrances, or
   pheromones) via flash nanoprecipitation (FNP). We have modified the
   original CIJ design to allow hand operation, eliminating the need for a
   syringe pump, and we added a second antisolvent dilution stage.
   Impingement mixing requires equal flow momentum from two opposing jets,
   one containing the drug in organic solvent and the other containing an
   antisolvent, typically water. The subsequent dilution step in the new
   design allows rapid quenching with high antisolvent concentration that
   enhances nanoparticle stability. This new CIJ with dilution (CIJ-D)
   mixer is a simple, cheap, and efficient device to produce nanoparticles.
   We have made 55?nm diameter beta-carotene nanoparticles using the CIJ-D
   mixer. They are stable and reproducible in terms of particle size and
   distribution. We have also compared the performance of our CIJ-D mixer
   with the vortex mixer, which can operate at unequal flow rates (Liu et
   al., 2008. Chem Eng Sci 63:28292842), to make beta-carotene-containing
   particles over a series of turbulent conditions. On the basis of dynamic
   light scattering measurements, the new CIJ-D mixer produces stable
   particles of a size similar to the vortex mixer. Our CIJ-D design
   requires less volume and provides an easily operated and inexpensive
   tool to produce nanoparticles via FNP and to evaluate new nanoparticle
   formulation. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the American

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus is
   an effective treatment for Parkinson disease. However, DBS is not
   responsive to an individual's disease state, and programming parameters,
   once established, do not change to reflect disease state. Local field
   potentials (LFPs) recorded from DBS electrodes are being investigated as
   potential biomarkers for the Parkinson disease state. However, no
   patient data exist about what happens to LFPs over the lifetime of the
   implant.
   OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether LFP amplitude and response to limb
   movement differed between patients implanted acutely with subthalamic
   nucleus DBS electrodes and patients implanted 2 to 7 years previously.
   METHODS: We recorded LFPs at DBS surgery time (9 subjects), 3 weeks
   after initial placement (9 subjects), and 2 to 7 years (median: 3.5)
   later during implanted programmable generator replacement (11 sides).
   LFP power-frequency spectra for each of 3 bipolar electrode derivations
   of adjacent contacts were calculated over 5-minute resting and 30-second
   movement epochs. Monopolar impedance data were used to evaluate trends
   over time.
   RESULTS: There was no significant difference in beta-band LFP amplitude
   between initial electrode implantation (OR) and 3-week post-OR times (P
   = .94). However, beta-band amplitude was lower at implanted programmable
   generator replacement times than in OR (P = .008) and post-OR recordings
   (P = .039). Impedance measurements declined over time (P < .001).
   CONCLUSION: Postoperative LFP activity can be recorded years after DBS
   implantation and demonstrates a similar profile in response to movement
   as during acute recordings, although amplitude may decrease. These
   results support the feasibility of constructing a closed-loop,
   patient-responsive DBS device based on LFP activity.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents layer-by-layer (LbL) self-assembly of single-walled
   carbon nanotube (SWNT)/polymer membranes with a well-dispersed
   wide-range tunable volume fraction of functionalized SWNTs. The surface
   morphology of the SWNT/polymer membranes shows a high strength, dense
   and random network structures. The quartz crystal microbalance (QCM)
   characterization illustrates that the deposition thickness and the SWNT
   loading fraction in SWNT nanocomposites can be controlled in a large
   range based on LbL sequential deposition process. The Young's modulus of
   the self-assembled SWNT/polymer composite membranes is characterized by
   a combinative approach of piezoelectric excitation and laser vibrometer
   measurement. The Young's modulus of SWNT/polymer nanocomposites is
   tunable from hundreds to tens of GPa, as a function of the SWNT volume
   fraction. Such significant enhancement of LbL self-assembled SWNTs
   offers a way in which the embedded SWNTs can realize the true potential
   to strengthen SWNT/polymer nanocomposites. Conventional mixture models
   such as rule-of-mixture model and Halpin-Tsai model fail to explain the
   structure-property regime in nanoscale at a high SWNT fraction ratio.
   This observed tunability can serve as a benchmark to tailor the design
   of nanocomposite thin films for potential applications to MEMS and NEMS
   devices. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Solid tumors such as hepatocellular carcinoma are very often not
   amenable to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Local ablation methods,
   including chemical ablation with absolute ethanol, are therefore an
   option for treatment but lack of information about the mechanism of
   devitalization leading to cell death is a hindrance to further adoption.
   Systemic toxicity also has limited the amount of ethanol that can be
   used in a single treatment session. Therefore we evaluated the mechanism
   of urea, a denaturant with little or no systemic toxicity, for potential
   use in chemical ablation. In this study we report on the use of three
   methods to analyze the effects in cell culture with a view towards
   eventual clinical application. Human hepatoma HuH-7 cells were analyzed
   at several time points after treatment using FTIR, DSC, and Raman
   microspectroscopy based on MTT and Pl-exclusion viability assays. Time
   course fractional denaturation data plotted against viability show that
   a 50\% viability drop occurs after only a 10-20\% drop in overall
   protein denaturation. Other methods of cell death such as apoptosis may
   also be operative, but this result implies that protein denaturation is
   one of the major mechanisms of cell death. This is in line with what has
   been previously suggested for purely thermal methods, and opens the way
   to mechanism-based improvements in chemical ablation of solid tumors.}},

Abstract = {{The network that controls chemotaxis in Escherichia coli is one of the
   most completely characterized signal transduction systems to date.
   Receptor clustering accounts for characteristics such as high
   sensitivity, precise adaptation over a wide dynamic range of ligand
   concentrations, and robustness to variations in the amounts of
   intracellular proteins. To gain insights into the structure-function
   relationship of receptor clusters and understand the mechanism behind
   the high-performance signaling, we develop and analyze a model for a
   single trimer of dimers. This new model extends an earlier model (Spiro
   et al. in Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 94:7263-7268, 1997) to incorporate the
   recent experimental findings that the core structure of receptor
   clusters is the trimer of receptor dimers. We show that the model can
   reproduce most of the experimentally-observed behaviors, including
   excitation, adaptation, high sensitivity, and robustness to parameter
   variations. In addition, the model makes a number of new predictions as
   to how the adaptation time varies with the expression level of various
   proteins involved in signal transduction. Our results provide a more
   mechanistically-based description of the structure-function relationship
   for the signaling system, and show the key role of the interaction among
   dimer members of the trimer in the chemotactic response of cells.}},

Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{Melt blowing combines extrusion of molten polymer through small orifices
   with stretching of the hot extrudate by hot air jets to create long,
   small diameter, fibers. Simulations and experiments were performed to
   examine: (1) the influence of increasing air pressure inside the melt
   blowing die (P-inlet) on the air jet in a typical melt blowing process
   and (2) the influence of a Laval nozzle (a converging-diverging nozzle)
   on the air jet. The baseline case without a nozzle was simulated and
   examined based on the y-component of the air velocity profile, v(y)(y),
   at the centerline as a function of P-inlet, As P-inlet increases: (1)
   the air flow goes from subsonic to supersonic and (2) the maximum value
   of v(y)(y) increases with increasing P-inlet, then starts to oscillate
   with the formation of compression waves in the supersonic region,
   P-inlet, >= 15 psig. Simulation also showed that a Laval nozzle
   influences the air flow field by increasing the maximum value of vy(y)
   and eliminating the compression wave at a predictable value of P-inlet.
   Actual density oscillations in the supersonic flow field exiting a melt
   blowing die, with and without a Laval nozzle, were captured using a
   Schlieren visualization technique. In both limits the experimental
   results are in good agreement with the density oscillation in the
   supersonic flow field of the air jet anticipated by the simulations. (C)

Abstract = {{The vertical diffusional mass (solute) transfer through a suspended
   sediment layer, e.g. at the bottom of a lake, reservoir or estuary, by
   the propagation of velocity fluctuations from above was investigated.
   The attenuation of the velocity fluctuations in the suspension layer and
   the associated effect on solute transfer through the suspension layer
   was simulated. To represent large eddies traveling downstream in water
   over a high-concentration suspended sediment layer, a streamwise
   velocity fluctuation moving in downstream direction was imposed along
   the upper boundary of the suspension layer. Velocity fluctuations and
   downstream velocity were normalized by the shearvelocity (U-{*}) at the
   top of the suspension layer. Streamwise and vertical velocity components
   inside the suspension layer, were obtained from the 2-D continuity and
   the Navier-Stokes equations. The persistence of turbulence with depth-as
   it penetrates from the overlying water into the suspension layer-was
   found to depend on its amplitude, its period, and on the apparent
   viscosity of the suspension. The turbulence was found to propagate
   efficiently into the suspension layer when its frequency is low, and the
   apparent viscosity of the suspension is high. Effects on vertical mass
   transfer were parameterized by penetration depth and effective diffusion
   coefficient, and related to apparent viscosity of the suspension,
   Schmidt number and shear velocity on top of the suspension layer. The
   enhancement of turbulence penetration by viscosity is similar to the
   flow near an oscillating flat plate (Stokes' second problem), but is
   opposite to turbulence penetration into a stationary porous and
   permeable sediment bed. The information is applicable to water quality
   modeling mear the sediment/water interface of lakes, river impoundments
   and estuaries.}},

Abstract = {{This study focusses on the assimilation of carbon in concentrated
   municipal wastewater rich in organic carbon using the mixotrophic
   microalga Auxenochlorella protothecoides UMN280 with the addition of
   supplemental CO2. The entire growth period of A. protothecoides UMN280
   can be characterized by three phases: first, a phase where algae grew in
   a mixotrophic-dominated mode; second, a transition phase; and last, a
   phase where algae grew in a photoautotrophic-dominated mode. In this
   study, it was found that light intensity had a strong effect on algal
   biomass production; the culture system would transfer from a
   mixotrophic-dominated mode to a photoautotrophic-dominated mode quicker
   under higher light intensities. The addition of CO2 exhibited an
   important role in the photoautotrophic-dominated cultivation stage. At
   certain level of irradiance and certain range of CO2 injection rate,
   higher CO2 injection rate would result in a higher level of carbon
   fixation. It is clearly beneficial to inject exogenous CO2 in the
   mixotrophic wastewater algae production system when a light source is
   available, such as during daylight hours.}},

Title = {{Spatiotemporal neural interactions underlying continuous drawing
   movements as revealed by magnetoencephalography}},
Journal = {{EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{222}},
Number = {{1-2}},
Pages = {{159-171}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Continuous and sequential movements are controlled by widely distributed
   brain regions. A series of studies have contributed to understanding the
   functional role of these regions in a variety of visuomotor tasks.
   However, little is known about the neural interactions underpinning
   continuous movements. In the current study, we examine the
   spatiotemporal neural interactions underlying continuous drawing
   movements and the association of them with behavioral components. We
   conducted an experiment in which subjects copied a pentagon continuously
   for similar to 45 s using an XY joystick, while neuromagnetic fluxes
   were recorded from their head using a 248-sensor whole-head
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) device. Each sensor time series was
   rendered stationary and non-autocorrelated by applying an autoregressive
   integrated moving average model and taking the residuals. We used the
   directional variability of the movement as a behavioral measure of the
   controls generated. The main objective of this study was to assess the
   relation between neural interactions and the variability of movement
   direction. That is, we divided the continuous recordings into
   consecutive periods (i.e., time-bins) of 51 steps duration and computed
   the pairwise cross-correlations between the prewhitened time series in
   each time-bin. The circular standard deviation of the movement direction
   within each time-bin provides an estimate of the directional variability
   of the 51-ms trajectory segment. We looked at the association between
   neural interactions and variability of movement direction, separately
   for each pair of sensors, by running a cross-correlation analysis
   between the strength of the MEG pairwise cross-correlations and the
   circular standard deviations. We identified two types of neuronal
   networks: in one, the neural interactions are correlated with the
   directional variability of the movement at negative time-lags
   (feedforward), and in the other, the neural interactions are correlated
   with the directional variability of the movement at positive time-lags
   (feedback). Sensors associated mostly with feedforward processes are
   distributed in the left hemisphere and the right occipital-temporal
   junction, whereas sensors related to feedback processes are distributed
   in the right hemisphere and the left cerebellar hemisphere. These
   results are in line with findings from a series of previous studies
   showing that specific brain regions are involved in feedforward and
   feedback control processes to plan, perform, and correct movements.
   Additionally, we looked at whether changes in movement direction
   modulate the neural interactions. Interestingly, we found a
   preponderance of sensors associated with changes in movement direction
   over the right hemisphere-ipsilateral to the moving hand. These sensors
   exhibit stronger coupling with the rest of the sensors for trajectory
   segments with high rather than low directional movement variability. We
   interpret these results as evidence that ipsilateral cortical regions
   are recruited for continuous movements when the curvature of the
   trajectory increases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study that shows how neural interactions are associated with a
   behavioral control parameter in continuous and sequential movements.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulation of recombinant Escherichia coli cells expressing a
   biocatalyst has the potential to produce stable, long-lasting enzyme
   activity that can be used for numerous applications. The current study
   describes the use of this technology with recombinant E. coli cells
   expressing the atrazine-dechlorinating enzyme AtzA in a silica/polymer
   porous gel. This novel recombinant enzyme-based method utilizes both
   adsorption and degradation to remove atrazine from water. A combination
   of silica nanoparticles (Ludox TM40), alkoxides, and an organic polymer
   was used to synthesize a porous gel. Gel curing temperatures of 23 or 45
   A degrees C were used either to maintain cell viability or to render the
   cells non-viable, respectively. The enzymatic activity of the
   encapsulated viable and non-viable cells was high and extremely stable
   over the time period analyzed. At room temperature, the encapsulated
   non-viable cells maintained a specific activity between (0.44 A +/-
   0.06) mu mol/g/min and (0.66 A +/- 0.12) mu mol/g/min for up to 4
   months, comparing well with free, viable cell-specific activities (0.61
   A +/- 0.04 mu mol/g/min). Gels cured at 45 A degrees C had excellent
   structural rigidity and contained few viable cells, making these gels
   potentially compatible with water treatment facility applications. When
   encapsulated, non-viable cells were assayed at 4 A degrees C, the
   activity increased threefold over free cells, potentially due to
   differences in lipid membranes as shown by FTIR spectroscopy and
   electron microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{We present Interactive Slice World-in-Miniature (WIM), a framework for
   navigating and interrogating volumetric data sets using an interface
   enabled by a virtual reality environment made of two display surfaces:
   an interactive multitouch table, and a stereoscopic display wall. The
   framework addresses two current challenges in immersive visualization:
   1) providing an appropriate overview+detail style of visualization while
   navigating through volume data, and 2) supporting interactive querying
   and data exploration, i.e., interrogating volume data. The approach
   extends the WIM metaphor, simultaneously displaying a large-scale
   detailed data visualization and an interactive miniature. Leveraging the
   table+wall hardware, horizontal slices are projected (like a shadow)
   down onto the table surface, providing a useful 2D data overview to
   complement the 3D views as well as a data context for interpreting 2D
   multitouch gestures made on the table. In addition to enabling effective
   navigation through complex geometries, extensions to the core Slice WIM
   technique support interacting with a set of multiple slices that persist
   on the table even as the user navigates around a scene and annotating
   and measuring data via points, paths, and volumes specified using
   interactive slices. Applications of the interface to two volume data
   sets are presented, and design decisions, limitations, and user feedback

Abstract = {{Biobased polymeric materials are gaining increasing attention in
   biomedical areas. Here, we report a new class of biocompatible
   polyurethanes prepared from soybean oil-based polyol that was
   synthesized by ring-opening reaction of epoxidized monoglyceride (EMG)
   with lactic acid. By adjusting the molar ratio of hydroxyl to isocyanate
   group and the content of chain extender, soybean oil-based polyurethanes
   with tensile strength of 9.3027.1?MPa and elongation at break of
   74.1110.7\% were prepared, while usual lipid-based polyurethanes with
   the same 1,6-diisocyanatohexane as reactant hardly have tensile strength
   higher than 5?MPa. Mouse fibroblast cells (L-929) showed good adhesion
   and growth behavior on the polyurethane samples with more hydrophilic
   surfaces, and the cell viabilities of more than 50\% were achieved with
   commercial tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) disk as control. The good
   mechanical property and biocompatibility of the soybean oil-based
   polyurethanes will make them suitable for wide range of potential
   biomedical applications. Practical applications: The synthesized soybean
   oil-based polyurethanes have adjustable tensile strengths from
   9.3027.1?MPa and elongation at break of 74.1110.7\%. Along with their
   good biocompatibility, the polyurethanes can potentially replace wide
   range of part of petroleum-based polymeric materials, particularly as

Abstract = {{Biobased polymeric materials are gaining increasing attention in
   biomedical areas. Here, we report a new class of biocompatible
   polyurethanes prepared from soybean oil-based polyol that was
   synthesized by ring-opening reaction of epoxidized monoglyceride (EMG)
   with lactic acid. By adjusting the molar ratio of hydroxyl to isocyanate
   group and the content of chain extender, soybean oil-based polyurethanes
   with tensile strength of 9.30-27.1 MPa and elongation at break of
   74.1-110.7\% were prepared, while usual lipid-based polyurethanes with
   the same 1,6-diisocyanatohexane as reactant hardly have tensile strength
   higher than 5 MPa. Mouse fibroblast cells (L-929) showed good adhesion
   and growth behavior on the polyurethane samples with more hydrophilic
   surfaces, and the cell viabilities of more than 50\% were achieved with
   commercial tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) disk as control. The good
   mechanical property and biocompatibility of the soybean oil-based
   polyurethanes will make them suitable for wide range of potential

Abstract = {{The dynamics, operability limits, and tuning of a proportional-integral
   feedback controller to stabilize detached vertical Bridgman crystal
   growth are analyzed using a capillary model of shape stability. The
   manipulated variable is the pressure difference between upper and lower
   vapor spaces, and the controlled variable is the gap width at the
   triple-phase line. Open and closed loop dynamics of step changes in
   these state variables are analyzed under both shape stable and shape
   unstable growth conditions. Effects of step changes in static contact
   angle and growth angle are also studied. Proportional and
   proportional-integral control can stabilize unstable growth, but only
   within tight operability limits imposed by the narrow range of allowed
   meniscus shapes. These limits are used to establish safe operating
   ranges of controller gain. Strong nonlinearity of the capillary model
   restricts the range of perturbations that can be stabilized, and under
   some circumstances, stabilizes a spurious operating state far from the
   set point. Stabilizing detachment at low growth angle proves difficult
   and becomes impossible at zero growth angle. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Using wastewater to grow algae is probably the most promising route to
   reduce production costs associated with nutrients and water. In this
   study, a newly isolated facultative heterotrophic freshwater microalgae
   strain, Auxenochlorella protothecoides UMN280, was examined for algal
   growth, wastewater nutrient removal efficiency, and lipid accumulation
   in batch and semi-continuous cultivation with various hydraulic
   retention time using concentrated municipal wastewater (CMW) as
   cultivation media. The results of the 6 day batch cultivation showed
   that the maximal removal efficiencies for total nitrogen, total
   phosphorus, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total organic carbon (TOC)
   were over 59\%, 81\%, 88\% and 96\%, respectively, with high growth rate
   (0.490 d(-1)), high biomass productivity (269 mg L-1 d(-1)) and high
   lipid productivity (78 mg L-1 d(-1)). Further fatty acid methyl ester
   (FAME) analysis showed that the microalgal lipids were mainly composed
   of C16/C18 fatty acids (accounting for over 94\% of total fatty acid),
   which are suitable for high-quality biodiesel production. The system
   could be scaled up from 100 mL flasks to 25 L BIOCOIL reactors, and
   semi-continuously operated at hydraulic retention time of 3 days with a
   net biomass productivity of 1.51 g L-1 d(-1) of dried algae. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{This paper proposes Trajectory-based Statistical Forwarding (TSF)
   scheme, tailored for the multihop data delivery from infrastructure
   nodes (e. g., Internet access points) to moving vehicles in vehicular ad
   hoc networks. To our knowledge, this paper presents the first attempt to
   investigate how to effectively utilize the packet destination vehicle's
   trajectory for such an infrastructure-to-vehicle data delivery. This
   data delivery is performed through the computation of a target point
   based on the destination vehicle's trajectory that is an optimal
   rendezvous point of the packet and the destination vehicle. TSF forwards
   packets over multihop to a selected target point where the vehicle is
   expected to pass by. Such a target point is selected optimally to
   minimize the packet delivery delay while satisfying the required packet
   delivery probability. The optimality is achieved analytically by
   utilizing the packet's delivery delay distribution and the destination
   vehicle's travel delay distribution. Through theoretical analysis and
   extensive simulation, it is shown that our design provides an efficient
   data forwarding under a variety of vehicular traffic conditions.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1791-1813}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The focus of this study is the sustained body force (the so-called
   acoustic radiation force) in homogeneous tissue-like solids generated by
   an elevated-intensity, focused ultrasound field (Mach number =
   O(10(-3))) in situations when the latter is modulated by a low-frequency
   signal. This intermediate-asymptotics problem, which bears relevance to
   a number of emerging biomedical applications, is characterized by a
   number of small (but non-vanishing) parameters including the Mach
   number, the ratio between the modulation and ultrasound frequency, the
   ratio of the shear to bulk modulus, and the dimensionless attenuation
   coefficient. On approximating the response of soft tissues as that of a
   nonlinear viscoelastic solid with heat conduction, the featured
   second-order problem is tackled via a scaling paradigm wherein the
   transverse coordinates are scaled by the width of the focal region,
   while the axial and temporal coordinate are each split into a ``fast{''}
   and ``slow{''} component with the twin aim of: (i) canceling the linear
   terms from the field equations governing the propagation of
   elevated-intensity ultrasound, and (ii) accounting for the effect of
   ultrasound modulation. In the context of the focused ultrasound
   analyses, the key feature of the proposed study revolves around the
   dual-time-scale treatment of the temporal variable, which allows one to
   parse out the contribution of ultrasound and its modulation in the
   nonlinear solution. In this way the acoustic radiation force (ARF),
   giving rise to the mean tissue motion, is exacted by computing the
   ``fast{''} time average of the germane field equations. A comparison
   with the existing theory reveals a number of key features that are
   brought to light by the new formulation, including the contributions to
   the ARF of ultrasound modulation and thermal expansion, as well as the
   precise role of constitutive nonlinearities in generating the sustained
   body force in tissue-like solids by a focused ultrasound beam. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{An efficient sparse modeling pipeline for the classification of human

   followed by the learning of a class-structured dictionary encoding the

   reconstruction, where the label assigned to each video comes from the
   optimal sparse linear combination of the learned basis vectors (action
   primitives) representing the actions. A low computational cost
   deep-layer model learning the inter-class correlations of the data is
   added for increasing discriminative power. In spite of its simplicity
   and low computational cost, the method outperforms previously reported

Abstract = {{We report the reversible photoinduced self-assembly of a diblock
   copolymer in a typical hydrophobic ionic liquid,
   1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ({[}C(4)mim]PF6). A
   series of random copolymers consisting of 4-phenylazophenyl methacrylate
   and N-isopropylacrylamide (P(AzoMA-r-NIPAm)) show both photoresponsive
   solubility changes and upper critical solution temperature (UCST) phase
   transitions in {[}C(4)mim]PF6. The UCST phase transition temperature of
   the random copolymer depends strongly on the composition of AzoMA as
   well as on the photo-isomerization state of the azobenzene moiety. The
   phase transition temperature of P(trans-AzoMA-r-NIPAm) in the dark is
   lower than that of P(cis-AzoMA-r-NIPAm) under UV-light irradiation.
   Reversible solubility changes by changing the wavelength of incident
   light were demonstrated by using the difference between the phase
   transition temperatures. On the basis of the results, we apply the
   thermo- and photoresponsive property of the random copolymer to a block
   copolymer system. A well-defined diblock copolymer
   (PEO-b-P(AzoMA-r-NIPAm)) was successfully prepared by combining anionic
   ring-opening polymerization of ethylene oxide (EO) and reversible
   addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization of AzoMA and
   NIPAm. A PEO-b-P(AzoMA-r-NIPAm) diblock copolymer is found to exhibit
   low-temperature micelle and high-temperature unimer (upper critical
   micellization temperature (UCMT)) transition in {[}C(4)mim]PF6 from
   dynamic light scattering (DLS) measurements. The aggregation temperature
   of the diblock copolymer depends on the photo-isomerization state of
   azobenzene, as expected. We demonstrated photoinduced self-assembly of
   the diblock copolymer in {[}C(4)mim]PF6 at a ``bistable{''} temperature.
   Reversibility of the micelle formation and dissolution into single
   polymer chains was also demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules (MTs) polymerize via net addition of GTP-tubulin subunits
   to the MT plus end, which subsequently hydrolyze to GDP-tubulin in the
   MT lattice. Relatively stable GTP-tubulin subunits create a ``GTP
   cap{''} at the growing MT plus end that suppresses catastrophe. To
   understand MT assembly regulation, we need to understand GTP hydrolysis
   reaction kinetics and the GTP cap size. In vitro, the GTP cap has been
   estimated to be as small as one layer {[}1-3] (13 subunits) or as large
   as 100-200 subunits {[}4]. GTP cap size estimates in vivo have not yet
   been reported. Using EB1-EGFP as a marker for GTP-tubulin in epithelial
   cells, we find on average (1) 270 EB1 dimers bound to growing MT plus
   ends, and (2) a GTP cap size of similar to 750 tubulin subunits. Thus,
   in vivo, the GTP cap is far larger than previous estimates in vitro, and
   similar to 60-fold larger than a single layer cap. We also find that the
   tail of a large GTP cap promotes MT rescue and suppresses shortening. We
   speculate that a large GTP cap provides a locally concentrated scaffold
   for tip-tracking proteins and confers persistence to assembly in the
   face of physical barriers such as the cell cortex.}},

Title = {{Model-based design of transverse wall oscillations for turbulent drag
   reduction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{707}},
Pages = {{205-240}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Over the last two decades, both experiments and simulations have
   demonstrated that transverse wall oscillations with properly selected
   amplitude and frequency can reduce turbulent drag by as much as 40\%. In
   this paper, we develop a model-based approach for designing oscillations
   that suppress turbulence in a channel flow. We utilize
   eddy-viscosity-enhanced linearization of the turbulent flow with control
   in conjunction with turbulence modelling to determine skin-friction drag
   in a simulation-free manner. The Boussinesq eddy viscosity hypothesis is
   used to quantify the effect of fluctuations on the mean velocity in flow
   subject to control. In contrast to the traditional approach that relies
   on numerical simulations, we determine the turbulent viscosity from the
   second-order statistics of the linearized model driven by white-in-time
   stochastic forcing. The spatial power spectrum of the forcing is
   selected to ensure that the linearized model for uncontrolled flow
   reproduces the turbulent energy spectrum. The resulting correction to
   the turbulent mean velocity induced by small-amplitude wall movements is
   then used to identify the optimal frequency of drag-reducing
   oscillations. In addition, the control net efficiency and the turbulent
   flow structures that we obtain agree well with the results of numerical
   simulations and experiments. This demonstrates the predictive power of
   our model-based approach to controlling turbulent flows and is expected
   to pave the way for successful flow control at higher Reynolds numbers
   than currently possible.}},

Title = {{Delaying the onset of dynamic wetting failure through meniscus
   confinement}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{707}},
Pages = {{496-520}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic wetting is crucial to processes where liquid displaces another
   fluid along a solid surface, such as the deposition of a coating liquid
   onto a moving substrate. Numerous studies report the failure of dynamic
   wetting past some critical process speed. However, the hydrodynamic
   factors that influence the transition to wetting failure remain poorly
   understood from an empirical and theoretical perspective. The objective
   of this investigation is to determine the effect of meniscus confinement
   on the onset of dynamic wetting failure. A novel experimental system is
   designed to simultaneously view confined and unconfined wetting systems
   as they approach wetting failure. The experimental apparatus consists of
   a scraped steel roll that rotates into a bath of glycerol. Confinement
   is imposed via a gap formed between a coating die and the roll surface.
   Flow visualization is used to record the critical roll speed at which
   wetting failure occurs. Comparison of the confined and unconfined data
   shows a clear increase in the relative critical speed as the meniscus
   becomes more confined. A hydrodynamic model for wetting failure is
   developed and analysed with (i) lubrication theory and (ii) a
   two-dimensional finite-element method (FEM). Both approaches do a
   remarkable job of matching the observed confinement trend, but only the
   two-dimensional model yields accurate estimates of the absolute values
   of the critical speeds due to the highly two-dimensional nature of the
   stress field in the displacing liquid. The overall success of the
   hydrodynamic model suggests a wetting failure mechanism primarily
   related to viscous bending of the meniscus.}},

Title = {{The dynamics of three-dimensional liquid bridges with pinned and moving
   contact lines}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{707}},
Pages = {{521-540}},
Month = {{SEP 25}},
Abstract = {{Liquid bridges with moving contact lines are relevant in a variety of
   natural and industrial settings, ranging from printing processes to the
   feeding of birds. While it is often assumed that the liquid bridge is
   two-dimensional in nature, there are many applications where either the
   stretching motion or the presence of a feature on a bounding surface
   lead to three-dimensional effects. To investigate this we solve Stokes
   equations using the finite-element method for the stretching of a
   three-dimensional liquid bridge between two flat surfaces, one
   stationary and one moving. We first consider an initially cylindrical
   liquid bridge that is stretched using either a combination of extension
   and shear or extension and rotation, while keeping the contact lines
   pinned in place. We find that whereas a shearing motion does not alter
   the distribution of liquid between the two plates, rotation leads to an
   increase in the amount of liquid resting on the stationary plate as
   breakup is approached. This suggests that a relative rotation of one
   surface can be used to improve liquid transfer to the other surface. We
   then consider the extension of non-cylindrical bridges with moving
   contact lines. We find that dynamic wetting, characterized through a
   contact line friction parameter, plays a key role in preventing the
   contact line from deviating significantly from its original shape as
   breakup is approached. By adjusting the friction on both plates it is
   possible to drastically improve the amount of liquid transferred to one
   surface while maintaining the fidelity of the liquid pattern.}},

Title = {{Targeting G with TAL Effectors: A Comparison of Activities of TALENs
   Constructed with NN and NK Repeat Variable Di-Residues}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP 24}},
Abstract = {{The DNA binding domain of Transcription Activator-Like (TAL) effectors
   can easily be engineered to have new DNA sequence specificities.
   Consequently, engineered TAL effector proteins have become important
   reagents for manipulating genomes in vivo. DNA binding by TAL effectors
   is mediated by arrays of 34 amino acid repeats. In each repeat, one of
   two amino acids (repeat variable di-residues, RVDs) contacts a base in
   the DNA target. RVDs with specificity for C, T and A have been
   described; however, among RVDs that target G, the RVD NN also binds A,
   and NK is rare among naturally occurring TAL effectors. Here we show
   that TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) made with NK to specify G have less
   activity than their NN-containing counterparts: fourteen of fifteen
   TALEN pairs made with NN showed more activity in a yeast recombination
   assay than otherwise identical TALENs made with NK. Activity was assayed
   for three of these TALEN pairs in human cells, and the results
   paralleled the yeast data. The in vivo data is explained by in vitro
   measurements of binding affinity demonstrating that NK-containing TAL
   effectors have less affinity for targets with G than their NN-containing
   counterparts. On targets for which G was substituted with A, higher
   G-specificity was observed for NK-containing TALENs. TALENs with
   different N- and C-terminal truncations were also tested on targets that
   differed in the length of the spacer between the two TALEN binding
   sites. TALENs with C-termini of either 63 or 231 amino acids after the
   repeat array cleaved targets across a broad range of spacer lengths -
   from 14 to 33 bp. TALENs with only 18 aa after the repeat array,
   however, showed a clear optimum for spacers of 13 to 16 bp. The data
   presented here provide useful guidelines for increasing the specificity
   and activity of engineered TAL effector proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Total cavopulmonary connection is the result of a series of palliative
   surgical repairs performed on patients with single ventricle heart
   defects. The resulting anatomy has complex and unsteady hemodynamics
   characterized by flow mixing and flow separation. Although varying
   degrees of flow pulsatility have been observed in vivo, non-pulsatile
   (time-averaged) boundary conditions have traditionally been assumed in
   hemodynamic modeling, and only recently have pulsatile conditions been
   incorporated without completely characterizing their effect or
   importance. In this study, 3D numerical simulations with both pulsatile
   and non-pulsatile boundary conditions were performed for 24 patients
   with different anatomies and flow boundary conditions from Georgia Tech
   database. Flow structures, energy dissipation rates and pressure drops
   were compared under rest and simulated exercise conditions. It was found
   that flow pulsatility is the primary factor in determining the
   appropriate choice of boundary conditions, whereas the anatomic
   configuration and cardiac output had secondary effects. Results show
   that the hemodynamics can be strongly influenced by the presence of
   pulsatile flow. However, there was a minimum pulsatility threshold,
   identified by defining a weighted pulsatility index (wPI), above which
   the influence was significant. It was shown that when wPI < 30\%, the
   relative error in hemodynamic predictions using time-averaged boundary
   conditions was less than 10\% compared to pulsatile simulations. In
   addition, when wPI < 50, the relative error was less than 20\%. A
   correlation was introduced to relate wPI to the relative error in
   predicting the flow metrics with non-pulsatile flow conditions. (c) 2012

Abstract = {{Impaired control of mediolateral body motion during walking is an
   important health concern. Developing treatments to improve mediolateral
   control is challenging, partly because the mechanisms by which muscles
   modulate mediolateral ground reaction force (and thereby modulate
   mediolateral acceleration of the body mass center) during unimpaired
   walking are poorly understood. To investigate this, we examined
   mediolateral ground reaction forces in eight unimpaired subjects walking
   at four speeds and determined the contributions of muscles, gravity, and
   velocity-related forces to the mediolateral ground reaction force by
   analyzing muscle-driven simulations of these subjects. During early
   stance (0-6\% gait cycle), peak ground reaction force on the leading
   foot was directed laterally and increased significantly (p < 0.05) with
   walking speed. During early single support (14-30\% gait cycle), peak
   ground reaction force on the stance foot was directed medially and
   increased significantly (p < 0.01) with speed. Muscles accounted for
   more than 92\% of the mediolateral ground reaction force over all
   walking speeds, whereas gravity and velocity-related forces made
   relatively small contributions. Muscles coordinate mediolateral
   acceleration via an interplay between the medial ground reaction force
   contributed by the abductors and the lateral ground reaction forces
   contributed by the knee extensors, plantarflexors, and adductors. Our
   findings show how muscles that contribute to forward progression and
   body-weight support also modulate mediolateral acceleration of the body
   mass center while weight is transferred from one leg to another during
   double support. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present a detailed study of the inter-nanohole distance that governs
   the self-imaging phenomenon created by the three-dimensional propagation
   of light through periodic nanohole arrays on plasmonic substrates. We
   used scanning near-field optical microscopy (SNOM) to map the light
   intensity distributions at various heights above 10 x 10 nanohole arrays
   of varying pitch sizes on silver films. Our results suggest the
   interhole spacing has to be greater than the wavelength of the incident
   light to create the self-imaging phenomenon. We also present
   finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations which show qualitative
   corroboration of our experimental results. Both our experimental and
   FDTD results show that the self-imaging phenomenon is more pronounced
   for structures with larger pitch sizes. We believe this self-imaging
   phenomenon is related to the Talbot imaging effect that has also been
   modified by a plasmonic component and can potentially be used to provide
   the basis for a new class of optical microscopes.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study is to demonstrate a convenient numerical
   approach for simulating nanoparticle diffusion using commercial
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. It uses the Eluerian
   approach and solves the convective diffusion equation. The advantage is
   that it does not require defining user codes. We demonstrated the
   application of this approach by modeling nanoparticle capture by
   personal protective garments, both woven and non-woven. Such process
   usually has low face velocity, causing the primary capture mechanism to
   be diffusion. Simulation results for the woven media show satisfactory
   agreement with the classical filtration theory when the Peclet number
   lies between 0.1 and 100. Results for non-woven media also agree with
   experimental measurements within the range of concern. This work
   demonstrates a simple modeling approach for the design and selection of
   personal protective media against dermal exposure of nanoparticles in

Abstract = {{Biodegradable organic carbon is often added to aquifers to stimulate
   microbial reduction of oxidized contaminants. This carbon also
   stimulates fermenters, which generate important metabolites that can
   fuel contaminant reduction and may enhance dissolution of hydrophobic
   compounds. Therefore, understanding how different methods of carbon
   addition affect the fermentative community will enable design of more
   effective remediation strategies. Our research objective was to evaluate
   the microbial communities that developed in model aquifer columns in
   response to pulsed or continuous molasses input. Results indicated that
   the continuously fed column produced relatively low concentrations of
   metabolic intermediates and had a greater proportion of Bacteria and
   methanogens, as measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction, near
   the column inlet. In contrast, the pulsed-fed column generated periodic
   high concentrations of metabolic intermediates, with Bacteria and
   methanogens distributed throughout the length of the column. The
   community structures of Bacteria and Archaea, measured via automated
   ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis, in the pulsed-fed column were
   significantly different from those in the control column (not fed). The
   microbial community composition of the continuously fed column, however,
   became increasingly similar to the control column along the column
   length. These results demonstrate that a strategy of pulsed carbon
   addition leads to activity that is associated with functional
   instability, in terms of the production of periodic pulses of
   fermentation products and changing carbon concentration, and may be
   advantageous for remediation by producing large quantities of beneficial
   intermediates and resulting in more homogenously distributed biomass.}},

Abstract = {{Traffic counts and models for describing use of non-motorized facilities
   such as sidewalks, trails, and bike lanes are generally unavailable.
   Because officials lack the data and tools needed to estimate use of
   facilities, their ability to make evidence-based choices among
   investment alternatives is limited. This paper (1) summarizes counts of
   cyclists and pedestrians between 2007 and 2010 at 259 locations in the
   city of Minneapolis, MN, (2) develops scaling factors for estimating
   12-h (6:30 am-6:30 pm) ``daily{''} counts from hourly counts, (3)
   presents models for estimating non-motorized traffic using ordinary
   least squares and negative binomial regressions, (4) validates each
   model using bicycle and pedestrian counts for 85 locations, and (5)
   estimates non-motorized traffic for every street in Minneapolis, MN.
   Across all locations, mean pedestrian traffic (51/h) exceeded mean
   bicycle traffic (38/h) by 35\%. One-hour counts were highly correlated
   with 12-h ``daily{''} counts suggesting that planners may focus on short
   time scales without compromising data quality. Significant correlates of
   non-motorized traffic vary by mode and model and include weather
   (temperature, precipitation), neighborhood socio-demographics (household
   income, education), built environment characteristics (land use mix),
   and street (or bicycle facility) type. When controlling for these
   factors, bicycle traffic increased over time and was higher on streets
   with bicycle facilities than without (and highest on off-street
   facilities). Our models can be used by policy-makers to estimate
   non-motorized traffic for streets where counts are unavailable or to
   estimate changes in non-motorized traffic associated with other changes
   in the built environment (e.g., adding bicycle lanes or changing land
   use). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel, bell-curve furnace temperature profile is presented and
   predicted to achieve macroscopically convex solid-liquid interface
   shapes during melt growth of CZT in an EDG furnace. A strategy is also
   presented to dynamically adapt this furnace profile so that uniform,
   convex interface shapes are maintained through an entire growth run.
   This approach represents a significant advance over traditional
   gradient-freeze profiles, which always yield concave interface shapes,
   and static heat transfer designs, such as pedestal design, that achieve
   convex interfaces over only a small portion of the growth run.
   Importantly, this strategy may be applied to any Bridgman configuration
   that utilizes multiple, controllable heating zones. Realizing a convex
   solidification interface via this adaptive bell-curve furnace profile is
   postulated to result in better crystallinity and higher yields than
   conventional CZT growth techniques. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{A thermal-capillary, finite-element model is developed for the
   Horizontal Ribbon Growth (HRG) system to study the characteristics of
   the process and to assess its feasibility to grow silicon sheets. The
   mathematical model formulation rigorously accounts for mass, energy, and
   momentum conservation while simultaneously representing capillary
   physics of the menisci, tracking of the solidification front, and
   self-consistent determination of ribbon thickness. Model results show
   the potential, with suitable heat transfer design, for the HRG process
   to achieve the formation of an extended, wedge-shaped interface with
   latent heat dissipation primarily in a direction perpendicular to the
   pulling direction. These attributes allow the HRG system to achieve
   higher pull rates under lower thermal gradients than vertical ribbon
   growth systems. Crystal thickness is predicted to decrease with
   increasing pull rate; however, contrary to prior analyses, pull rate
   limits are identified as limit-point bifurcations to quasi-steady
   solutions. Multiple solution branches correspond to stable and unstable
   operating states, exhibiting dramatically different interfacial shapes
   that identify possible failure mechanisms. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Multi-view learning via probabilistic latent semantic analysis}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{20-30}},
Month = {{SEP 15}},
Abstract = {{Multi-view learning arouses vast amount of interest in the past decades
   with numerous real-world applications in web page analysis,
   bioinformatics, image processing and so on. Unlike the most previous
   works following the idea of co-training, in this paper we propose a new
   generative model for Multi-view Learning via Probabilistic Latent
   Semantic Analysis, called MVPLSA. In this model, we jointly model the
   co-occurrences of features and documents from different views.
   Specifically, in the model there are two latent variables y for the
   latent topic and z for the document cluster, and three visible variables
   d for the document, for the feature, and nu for the view label. The
   conditional probability p(z vertical bar d), which is independent of nu,
   is used as the bridge to share knowledge among multiple views. Also, we
   have p(y vertical bar z, nu) and p(J vertical bar y, nu), which are
   dependent of nu, to capture the specifical structures inside each view.
   Experiments are conducted on four real-world data sets to demonstrate
   the effectiveness and superiority of our model. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {{The role of zeolite topology in the stepwise methylation of ethene by
   surface methoxides was investigated. Density functional theory was
   employed in the determination of reaction mechanisms and energy
   barriers. Elementary steps were studied across multiple frameworks
   (i.e., BEA, CHA, FER, MFI, and MOR) constituting a wide variety of
   confinement environments. Surface methoxides were found to react with
   ethene through a transition state containing planar CH3 species, which
   was best stabilized at the intersection of the 10-membered ring channels
   of MFI. A cyclopropane reaction intermediate was found in all cases; its
   decomposition necessitated a transition state containing a primary
   carbocation, which was best stabilized within the 8-membered ring side
   pockets of MOR. The activation energies corresponding to each transition
   state geometry depend upon different aspects of the local pore topology,
   implying that confinement effects can not be simply correlated to pore
   size.}},

Abstract = {{While the transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom
   (TraPPE-UA) force field has generally been successful at providing
   parameters that are highly transferable between different molecules, the
   polarity and polarizability of a given functional group can be
   significantly perturbed in small cyclic structures, which limits the
   transferability of parameters obtained for linear molecules. This has
   motivated us to develop a version of the TraPPE-UA force field
   specifically for five- and six-membered cyclic alkanes and ethers. The
   Lennard-Jones parameters for the methylene group obtained from cyclic
   alkanes are transferred to the ethers for each ring size, and those for
   the oxygen atom are common to all compounds for a given ring size.
   However, the partial charges are molecule specific and parametrized
   using liquid-phase dielectric constants. This model yields accurate
   saturated liquid densities and vapor pressures, critical temperatures
   and densities, normal boiling points, heat capacities, and isothermal
   compressibilities for the following molecules: cyclopentane,
   tetrahydrofuran, 1,3-dioxolane, c-yclohexane, oxane, 1,4-dioxane,
   1,3-dioxane, and 1,3,5-trioxane. The azeotropic behavior and separation
   factor for the binary mixtures of 1,3-dioxolane/cyclohexane and
   ethanol/1,4-dioxane are qualitively reproduced.}},

Abstract = {{A novel series of naphthalene-based poly(arylene ether ketone)
   copolymers containing methoxy groups and hexafluoroisopropylidene
   diphenyl moieties (6F-MNPAEK5) were successfully synthesized by aromatic
   nucleophilic polycondensation. Chain-type fluorinated and sulfonated
   naphthalene-based poly(arylene ether ketone) copolymers (6F-SNPAEKs)
   were subsequently synthesized by demethylation and sulfobutylation. The
   chemical structures of 6F-SNPAEKs were confirmed by H-1 NMR. The
   6F-SNPAEKs in acid form showed excellent thermal stability at elevated
   temperatures. The 6F-SNPAEK membranes were easily obtained by solution
   casting and properties for fuel cells were investigated in detail. The
   water uptake, swelling ratio and proton conductivity increased with
   degree of sulfonation (DS) and temperature. 6F-SNPAEK-90 showed the
   highest conductivity of 0.181 S cm(-1) at 80 degrees C. The methanol
   permeability of the membranes was in the range of 0.238-6.49 x 10(-7)
   cm(2) s(-1), compared to 1.55 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1) for Nation 117. The
   membranes also showed excellent mechanical properties: the elongation at
   break was greater than 15\%. These results indicate that the 6F-SNPAEK
   membranes are a promising candidate for use in direct methanol fuel cell
   (DMFC) applications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   (DMS) and variable temperature small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS),
   leading to a mean-field expression for the segment-segment interaction
   parameter, chi = (41.2 +/- 0.9)/T - (0.044 +/- 0.002). This material is
   characterized by a larger value of chi, and much greater temperature
   sensitivity, than polystyrene-b-PMMA, providing access to tunable
   lamellar periods (pitch) down to 14 nm at technologically relevant
   temperatures. Nucleation and growth of lamellae, following cooling from
   the disordered state, was characterized by SAXS well above the glass
   transition temperature (T-g approximate to 130 degrees C) and
   extrapolated to lower processing temperatures based on polymer chain
   relaxation times extracted from time-temperature superposed DMS data.

Abstract = {{To fully utilize graphene's remarkable optical properties for
   optoelectronic applications, it needs to be integrated in planar
   photonic systems. Here, we demonstrate integration of graphene on
   silicon photonic circuits and precise measurement of the optical
   absorption coefficient in a graphene/waveguide hybrid structure. A
   method based on Mach-Zehnder interferometry is employed to achieve high
   measurement precision and consistency, yielding a maximal value of
   absorption coefficient of 0.2 dB/mu m when graphene is located directly
   on top of the waveguide. The averaged results obtained from a large
   number of samples agree with theoretical model utilizing the universal
   ac conductivity in graphene. Our work provides an important guide for
   the design and optimization of integrated graphene optoelectronic
   devices. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Coastline shape is among the basic geometric properties of the Earth's
   surface, yet defining and quantifying coastline shape precisely remains
   challenging. Here we propose new methods, based on the dilation and
   erosion operators of mathematical morphology (MM), for the
   characterization of delta shorelines, a class of open coasts. We
   demonstrate the suitability of MM-based methods for noise removal and
   shoreline identification from digital images of river deltas of varying
   geometric complexity. We also show that a global, a regional and a local
   shoreline parameter provide a first step in distinguishing among river,
   wave, and tidal dominated delta shapes. Citation: Geleynse, N., V. R.

Abstract = {{Single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) spectra from liquids having low

   During SBSL from aqueous sulfuric acid containing dissolved neon,
   rovibronic emission spectra reveal vibrationally hot sulfur monoxide
   (SO; T-v = 2100 K) that is also rotationally cold (T-r = 290 K). In
   addition to SO, excited neon atom emission gives an estimated
   temperature, for neon, of several thousand Kelvin. This nonequilibrated
   temperature is consistent with dynamically constrained SO formation at
   the liquid-vapor interface of the collapsing bubble. Formation occurs
   via collisions of fast neon atoms (generated within the collapsing
   bubble) with liquid-phase molecular species in the interfacial region,
   thus allowing for a mechanistic understanding of the processes leading

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{SEP 6}},
Abstract = {{We used a mobility edge transport model and solved the drift-diffusion
   equation to characterize the space-charge-limited current of a rubrene
   single-crystal hole-only diode. The current-voltage characteristics
   suggest that current is injection-limited at high voltage when holes are
   injected from the bottom contact (reverse bias). In contrast, the
   low-voltage regime shows that the current is higher when holes are
   injected from the bottom contact as compared to hole injection from the
   top contact (forward bias), which does not exhibit injection-limited
   current in the measured voltage range. This behavior is attributed to an
   asymmetric distribution of trap states in the semiconductor,
   specifically, a distribution of traps located near the top contact.
   Accounting for a localized trap distribution near the contact allows us
   to reproduce the temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics
   in forward and reverse bias simultaneously, i.e., with a single set of
   model parameters. We estimated that the local trap distribution contains
   1.19 x 10(11) cm(-2) states and decays as exp (-x/32.3 nm) away from the
   semiconductor-contact interface. The local trap distribution near one
   contact mainly affects injection from the same contact, hence breaking
   the symmetry in the charge transport. The model also provides
   information of the band mobility, energy barrier at the contacts, and
   bulk trap distribution with their corresponding confidence intervals.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing numbers of people are managing their social networks on
   mobile information and communication technology (ICT) platforms. This
   study materializes these social relationships by leveraging spatial and
   networked information for sharing excess capacity to reduce the
   environmental impacts associated with ``last-mile{''} package delivery
   systems from online purchases, particularly in low population density
   settings. Alternative package pickup location systems (PLS), such as a
   kiosk on a public transit platform or in a grocery store, have been
   suggested as effective strategies for reducing package travel miles and
   greenhouse gas emissions, compared to current door-to-door delivery
   models (CDS). However, our results suggest that a pickup location
   delivery system operating in a suburban setting may actually increase
   travel miles and emissions. Only once a social network is employed to
   assist in package pickup (SPLS) are significant reductions in the
   last-mile delivery distance and carbon emissions observed across both
   urban and suburban settings. Implications for logistics management's
   decades-long focus on improving efficiencies of dedicated distribution
   systems through specialization, as well as for public policy targeting
   carbon emissions of the transport sector are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Polymersomes, polymeric vesicles that self-assemble in aqueous solutions
   from block copolymers, have been avidly investigated in recent years as
   potential drug delivery agents. Past work has highlighted
   peptide-functionalized polymersomes as a highly promising targeted
   delivery system. However, few reports have investigated the ability of
   polymersomes to operate as gene delivery agents. In this study, we
   report on the encapsulation and delivery of siRNA inside of
   peptide-functionalized polymersomes composed of
   poly(1,2-butadiene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide). In particular, PR\_b
   peptide-functionalized polymer vesicles are shown to be a promising
   system for siRNA delivery. PR\_b is a fibronectin mimetic peptide
   targeting specifically the alpha(5)beta(1) integrin. The Orai3 gene was
   targeted for siRNA knockdown, and PR\_b-functionalized polymer vesicles
   encapsulating siRNA were found to specifically decrease cell viability
   of T47D breast cancer cells to a certain extent, while preserving
   viability of noncancerous MCF10A breast cells. siRNA delivery by
   PR\_b-functionalized polymer vesicles was compared to that of a current
   commercial siRNA transfection agent, and produced less dramatic
   decreases in cancer cell viability, but compared favorably in regards to
   the relative toxicity of the delivery systems. Finally, delivery and
   vesicle release of a fluorescent encapsulate by PR\_b-functionalized
   polymer vesicles was visualized by confocal microscopy, and
   colocalization with cellular endosomes and lysosomes was assessed by
   organelle staining. Polymersomes were observed to primarily release
   their encapsulate in the early endosomal intracellular compartments, and
   data may suggest some escape to the cytosol. These results represent a
   promising first generation model system for targeted delivery of siRNA.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Month = {{SEP 3}},
Abstract = {{Flexible microelectronics has shown tremendous promise in a broad
   spectrum of applications, especially those that cannot be addressed by
   conventional microelectronics in rigid materials and constructions.
   These unconventional yet important applications range from flexible
   consumer electronics to conformal sensor arrays and biomedical devices.
   A recent paradigm shift in implementing flexible electronics is to
   physically transfer highly integrated devices made in high-quality,
   crystalline semiconductors on to plastic substrates. Here we demonstrate
   a flexible form of silicon photonics using the transfer-and-bond
   fabrication method. Photonic circuits including interferometers and
   resonators have been transferred onto flexible plastic substrates with
   preserved functionalities and performance. By mechanically deforming,
   the optical characteristics of the devices can be tuned reversibly over
   a remarkably large range. The demonstration of the new flexible photonic
   systems based on the silicon-on-plastic (SOP) platform could open the
   door to many future applications, including tunable photonics,
   optomechanical sensors and biomechanical and bio-photonic probes.}},

Abstract = {{Adaptive control has the potential to improve the performance and
   reliability of aircraft systems. Implementation of adaptive control on
   commercial and military aircraft requires the flight control system to
   be verified and validated with respect to modeling error, uncertainty,
   and time delay. Currently, there is a lack of tools available to
   rigorously analyze the robustness of adaptive controllers due to their
   inherently nonlinear dynamics. Newly proposed nonlinear robustness
   analysis tools are applied to adaptive flight control in this paper. A
   standard model reference adaptive controller with sigma modification is
   designed for a linear short-period aircraft model. The resulting
   nonlinear closed-loop system is governed by polynomial dynamics. The
   nonlinear analysis algorithms rely on sum-of-squares polynomial
   optimization to assess the robustness of the adaptive closed-loop system
   with respect to a time delay. Time-delay margins are computed for
   various combinations of design parameters in the adaptive control law,
   as well as in the presence of parametric model uncertainty. Advantages
   and limitations of the proposed sum-of-squares-based robustness analysis
   are presented. Analysis results show a significant promise in the
   context of recent development in nonlinear robustness analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Several tests are used for the characterization of unbound materials for
   pavement applications. The resilient modulus has been one of the most
   common tests for design specification of unbound materials. The
   California bearing ratio (CBR) is another laboratory test that is
   frequently used. The dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) test is a more
   common test for in situ quality assessment/quality control of unbound
   materials. For better connection between design and quality assurance
   (QA)/quality control (QC), it would be helpful to have a reliable,
   mechanistic method for correlating test results. This is particularly
   true for the use of new materials, for which there is not an extensive
   body of data to empirically draw such connections. This paper presents a
   framework for a unified approach for modeling these tests. A
   discrete-element method (DEM) is used to simulate the CBR test, the DCP
   test, and the resilient modulus test. An initial evaluation demonstrated
   that the simulations can account for the effect of aggregate shape,
   size, gradation, friction, and stiffness. As such, this methodology
   shows promise for the development of mechanistic-based correlation
   between test results. These results are presented, along with some
   limitations of the current model and challenges for the future. DOI:

Abstract = {{An illustrative fracture mechanics-based design paradigm is proposed for
   unbonded concrete overlays (UBCOs), an increasingly popular pavement
   rehabilitation system, with the ultimate goal of establishing a more
   rational design procedure than those currently available. To illustrate
   the advantages of the fracture mechanics-based approach to design,
   specific attention is paid to one type of failure associated with
   pavement structures, reflection cracking. The design formulas derived
   from the results of a large number of crack propagation simulations of
   both the UBCO composite and a reference single-layer new pavement
   quantify the dependence of the required overlay thickness and
   load-carrying capacity on all relevant material and geometric
   parameters. Preliminary comparisons of the results with field
   observations suggest that the fracture mechanics paradigm offers a
   promising procedure for improved design of UBCOs. DOI:

Abstract = {{North-central Iowa is an agriculturally intensive area comprising the
   southeastern portion of the Prairie Pothole Region, a landscape
   containing a high density of enclosed topographical depressions.
   Artificial drainage practices have been implemented throughout the area
   to facilitate agricultural production. Vertical surface drains are
   utilized to drain the topographical depressions that accumulate water
   This study focuses on the hydrology of a drained topographical
   depression located in a 39.5 ha agricultural field. To assess the
   hydrology of the drained depression, a water balance was constructed for
   11 ponding events during the 2008 growing season. Continuous pond and
   groundwater level data were obtained with pressure transducers. Flows
   into the vertical surface drain were calculated based on pond depth.
   Precipitation inflows and evaporative outflows of the ponds were
   calculated using climatic data. Groundwater levels were used to assess
   groundwater/pond interactions. Results of the water balances show
   distinct differences between the inflows to and outflows from the
   depression based on antecedent conditions. In wet conditions,
   groundwater inflow sustained the ponds. The ponds receded only after the
   groundwater level declined to below the land surface. In drier
   conditions, groundwater was not a source of water to the depression.
   During these drier conditions, infiltration comprised 30\% of the
   outflows from the depression during declining pond stages. Over the
   entire study period, the surface drain, delivering water to the stream,
   was the largest outflow from the pond, accounting for 97\% of the
   oufflow, while evapotranspiration was just 2\%. Precipitation onto the
   pond surface proved to be a minor component, accounting for 4\% of the
   total inflows.}},

Title = {{Mechanics and kinematics of soft tissue under indentation are determined

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{25-35}},

Abstract = {{While several studies have evaluated how the degree of collagen
   alignment affects the response of soft tissues to tensile loading, the
   role of fibrillar organization in indentation is less understood.
   Collagen-based tissue-equivalents (TEs) provide a convenient model
   system to explore structure-function relationships since their
   microstructural properties can be easily controlled during fabrication.
   The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of initial collagen
   alignment on the mechanical and structural behavior of soft tissues
   subjected to indentation using TEs as a model system. Cell-compacted TEs
   with either isotropic or highly anisotropic fiber alignment were
   subjected to four-step incremental stress-relaxation indentation tests.
   The mechanical properties, collagen reorganization and 2D strain
   patterns were quantified at each indentation step and compared between
   groups. While no differences were seen in the peak force response,
   significant differences were seen in relaxation behavior, fiber
   kinematics and tissue strain. Specifically, highly aligned samples
   exhibited a slower relaxation rate, smaller changes in collagen fiber
   orientation, larger changes in strength of alignment, and larger strain
   magnitudes compared to isotropic samples. Results demonstrate the
   significant role that microstructural organization plays in mediating
   the response of soft tissues to a non-tensile (i.e., indentation)
   mechanical stimulus. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{How to characterize the relationship between science and technology has
   been a sensitive issue for historians of technology. This essay uses a
   recent and controversial piece by Paul Forman as a springboard for
   reexamining the concept of applied science and asks whether ``applied

   science{''} to mean the subordination of technological knowledge to
   scientific knowledge-and thus the subordination of history of technology
   to history of science. This essay argues that the historical moment for
   sensitivity on the subject of applied science has passed, that even in
   instances where technology can accurately be described as subordinate to
   science it need not follow that its history is subordinate, and that the
   concept can be useful in addressing issues in the history and

Abstract = {{We consider Markov decision processes with unknown transition
   probabilities and unknown single-period expected cost functions, and we
   study a method for estimating these quantities from historical or
   simulated data. The method requires knowledge of the system equations
   that govern state transitions as well as the single-period cost
   functions (but not the single-period expected cost functions). The
   estimation procedure is based upon taking expectations with respect to
   the empirical distribution functions of such data. Once the estimates
   are in place, the method computes a policy by solving the obtained
   ``empirical{''} Markov decision process as if the estimates were
   correct. For MDPs that satisfy some conditions, we provide explicit,
   easily computed expressions for the probability that the procedure will
   produce a policy whose true expected cost is within any specified
   absolute distance of the actual optimal expected cost of the true Markov
   decision process. We also provide expressions for the number of
   historical or simulated data values that is sufficient for the procedure
   to produce a policy whose true expected cost is, with a prescribed
   probability, within a prescribed absolute distance of the actual optimal
   expected cost of the true Markov decision process. We apply our results
   to multiperiod inventory models. In addition, we provide a specialized
   analysis of such inventory models that also yields relative, rather than
   absolute, accuracy guarantees. We make comparisons with related results
   that have recently appeared, and we provide numerical examples.}},

Volume = {{12}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Nanocrystals of alpha,omega-alkanedicarboxylic acids
   (HO2C(CH2)(n-2)CO2H, n = 3-13, odd) grown in aligned nanometer-scale
   cylindrical pores of nanoporous poly(cyclohexylethylene) monoliths
   (p-PCHE) adopt preferred orientations relative to the pore direction.
   X-ray diffraction reveals that nanocrystals of malonic acid (n = 3)
   grown in 14, 30, and 40 nm diameter pores adopted two preferred mutually
   perpendicular orientations simultaneously, each orientation coinciding
   with the direction of hydrogen-bonded chains in the solid state.
   Nanocrystals of glutaric acid (n = 5) embedded within 30 and 40 nm pores
   adopted orientations with hydrogen-bonded chains coincident with the
   pore direction, but the chains were perpendicular to the pore direction
   in 14 nm pores. Pimelic acid (n = 7) nanocrystals were oriented with
   their hydrogen-bonded chains parallel to the pore direction, but
   nanocrystals of longer alkane dicarboxylic acids (n = 9, 11, or 13)
   adopted orientations in which the their hydrogen-bonded chains
   progressively tilted away from the pore direction as the alkane length
   was increased. This behavior can be attributed to increasingly strong
   dispersive interactions between the alkane chains, which alter the
   ranking of the fast growing crystal directions. The appearance of
   preferred orientations for embedded nanocrystals argues that critical
   size effects and surface energy considerations favor precritical nuclei
   that are oriented with their fast growth axis aligned with the pore
   direction. This condition permits the nuclei to achieve critical size
   more readily while minimizing the area of planes with high surface
   energies, thereby providing a competitive advantage over other
   orientations during nucleation. The observation in some cases of two
   orientations simultaneously and size-dependent orientations reveals the
   delicate balance of free energies among differently oriented nuclei.
   Collectively, these observations demonstrate the utility of nanoscale
   confinement for investigating the earliest stages of crystal growth.}},

Abstract = {{The three-dimensional cardiac electrical imaging (3DCEI) technique was
   previously developed to estimate the initiation site(s) of cardiac
   activation and activation sequence from the noninvasively measured body
   surface potential maps (BSPMs). The aim of this study was to develop and
   evaluate the capability of 3DCEI in mapping the transmural distribution
   of extracellular potentials and localizing initiation sites of
   ventricular activation in an in vivo animal model. A control swine model
   (n = 10) was employed in this study. The heart-torso volume conductor
   model and the excitable heart model were constructed based on each
   animal's preoperative MR images and a priori known physiological
   knowledge. Body surface potential mapping and intracavitary noncontact
   mapping (NCM) were simultaneously conducted during acute ventricular
   pacing. The 3DCEI analysis was then applied on the recorded BSPMs. The
   estimated initiation sites were compared to the precise pacing sites; as
   a subset of the mapped transmural potentials by 3DCEI, the electrograms
   on the left ventricular endocardium were compared to the corresponding
   output of the NCM system. Over the 16 LV and 48 RV pacing studies, the
   averaged localization error was 6.1 +/- 2.3 mm, and the averaged
   correlation coefficient between the estimated endocardial electrograms
   by 3DCEI and from the NCM system was. The results demonstrate that the
   3DCEI approach can well localize the sites of initiation of ectopic
   beats and can obtain physiologically reasonable transmural potentials in
   an in vivo setting during focal ectopic beats. This study suggests the
   feasibility of tomographic mapping of 3D ventricular electrograms from
   the body surface recordings.}},

Abstract = {{Concentrically braced frames are stiff, strong systems frequently used
   to resist wind and seismic loading; in regions of high seismicity in the
   US special concentrically braced frames (SCBFs) are used. CBF
   configurations vary, but in low rise or other structures with modest
   levels of demands single-story, X-configured braced frames (X-braced)
   are commonly used. The brace sections used also vary but hollow
   structural sections (HSS) are the most common in the U.S. Although
   important, in part because low-rise structures sustain large demands,
   few research programs have focused on the single-story X-brace
   configuration. A large research program was undertaken to understand and
   improve the response of SCBFs with selected testing on single-story X
   braced SCBFs. The test matrix consisted of two, full-scale planar
   X-braced frame experiments and one nearly-full-scale three-dimensional
   X-braced frame. The tests were designed using a new design and detailing
   philosophy, called the Balanced Design Method. In this paper,
   application of this design method to the frame is investigated, with a
   focus on the center-splice connection. The results show that the
   ultimate inelastic deformation capacity of the system is less dependent
   on the specific design detail at this splice. Additionally, the
   bi-directional load testing indicated that the out-of-plane demands did
   not impact the system performance.}},

Title = {{Dynamically Dispatching Speculative Threads to Improve Sequential
   Execution}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON ARCHITECTURE AND CODE OPTIMIZATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Efficiently utilizing multicore processors to improve their performance
   potentials demands extracting thread-level parallelism from the
   applications. Various novel and sophisticated execution models have been
   proposed to extract thread-level parallelism from sequential programs.
   One such execution model, Thread-Level Speculation (TLS), allows
   potentially dependent threads to execute speculatively in parallel.
   However, TLS execution is inherently unpredictable, and consequently
   incorrect speculation could degrade performance for the multicore
   systems. Existing approaches have focused on using the compilers to
   select sequential program regions to apply TLS. Our research shows that
   even the state-of-the-art compiler makes suboptimal decisions, due to
   the unpredictability of TLS execution. Thus, we propose to dynamically
   optimize TLS performance.
   This article describes the design, implementation, and evaluation of a
   runtime thread dispatching mechanism that adjusts the behaviors of
   speculative threads based on their efficiency. In the proposed system,
   speculative threads are monitored by hardware-based performance counters
   and their performance impact is evaluated with a novel methodology that
   takes into account various unique TLS characteristics. Thread
   dispatching policies are devised to adjust the behaviors of speculative
   threads accordingly.
   With the help of the runtime evaluation, where and how to create
   speculative threads is better determined. Evaluated with all the SPEC
   CPU2000 benchmark programs written in C, the dynamic dispatching system
   outperforms the state-of-the-art compiler-based thread management
   techniques by 9.4\% on average. Comparing to sequential execution, we
   achieve 1.37X performance improvement on a four-core CMP-based system.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON EMBEDDED COMPUTING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Event-driven localization has been proposed as a low-cost solution for
   node positioning in wireless sensor networks. In order to eliminate the
   costly requirement for accurate event control in existing methods, we
   present a practical design using uncontrolled events. The main idea is
   to estimate both event generation parameters and the location of sensor
   nodes simultaneously, by processing node sequences that can be easily
   obtained from event detections. Besides the basic design, we proposed
   two enhancements to further extract information embedded in node
   orderings for two scenarios: (i) node density is high; and (ii) abundant
   events are available. To demonstrate the generality of our design, both
   straight-line scan and circular wave propagation events are addressed in
   the article, and we evaluated the design with extensive simulation as
   well as a testbed implementation with 41 MICAz motes. Results show that
   with only randomly generated events, our design can effectively localize
   nodes with great flexibility while adding little extra cost at the
   resource constrained sensor node side. In addition, localization via
   uncontrolled events provides a potential option of achieving node
   positioning through long-term ambient events.}},

Title = {{Reactive sputter deposition of pyrite structure transition metal
   disulfide thin films: Microstructure, transport, and magnetism}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{112}},

Month = {{SEP 1}},
Abstract = {{Transition metal disulfides crystallizing in the pyrite structure (e.
   g., TMS2, with TM = Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu) are a class of materials that
   display a remarkably diverse array of functional properties. These
   properties include highly spin-polarized ferromagnetism (in Co1-xFexS2),
   superconductivity (in CuS2), an antiferromagnetic Mott insulating ground
   state (in NiS2), and semiconduction with close to optimal parameters for
   solar absorber applications (in FeS2). Exploitation of these properties
   in heterostructured devices requires the development of reliable and
   reproducible methods for the deposition of high quality pyrite structure
   thin films. In this manuscript, we report on the suitability of reactive
   sputter deposition from metallic targets in an Ar/H2S environment as a
   method to achieve exactly this. Optimization of deposition temperature,
   Ar/H2S pressure ratio, and total working gas pressure, assisted by
   plasma optical emission spectroscopy, reveals significant windows over
   which deposition of single-phase, polycrystalline, low roughness pyrite
   films can be achieved. This is illustrated for the test cases of the
   ferromagnetic metal CoS2 and the diamagnetic semiconductor FeS2, for
   which detailed magnetic and transport characterization are provided. The
   results indicate significant improvements over alternative deposition
   techniques such as ex situ sulfidation of metal films, opening up
   exciting possibilities for all-sulfide heterostructured devices. In
   particular, in the FeS2 case it is suggested that fine-tuning of the
   sputtering conditions provides a potential means to manipulate doping
   levels and conduction mechanisms, critical issues in solar cell
   applications. Parenthetically, we note that conditions for synthesis of
   phase-pure monosulfides and thiospinels are also identified. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Thermodynamic analysis of an ideal solar-driven cycle for the capture of
   carbon dioxide using a CaO-based carbonation/calcination cycle is
   performed for gas mixtures with compositions corresponding to those of
   atmospheric air and power plant flue gases. Solar energy input
   requirements are examined as a function of CO2 molar fraction in the
   input gas, gas phase heat recovery, solid phase heat recovery, and
   carbonation and calcination temperatures. Gas phase heat recovery can
   reduce the solar energy input requirements by 22-99\%, with the largest
   gains occurring at lower CO2 molar fractions. Solid phase heat recovery
   can reduce the solar energy input requirements by 0.1-26\%, with the
   largest gains occurring at higher CO2 molar fractions. For a carbonation
   temperature of 673 K and a calcination temperature of 1273 K, over 45 MJ
   per mol of CO2 captured is required for a CO2 concentration of 300 ppm
   with no heat recovery. The minimum solar energy input required with

Abstract = {{Microwave torrefaction of Douglas fir pellets was investigated and the
   effects of process conditions on the yields of products were determined.
   The reaction temperature and time significantly influenced the yields of
   torrefied biomass, bio-oil, and noncondensable gases. Three linear
   models were developed to predict the product yield, as a function of
   reaction temperature and time. Gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy
   (GC/MS) analysis for bio-oils showed that the bio-oils were mainly
   composed of furans, phenolics, sugars, ketones/aldehydes, and organic
   acids. The amounts of each compound varied with the reaction conditions.
   Over the reaction temperature of 275 degrees C, noncondensable gases
   were mainly composed of CO2 and CO and its yields and compositions were
   significantly influenced by the temperature. Higher heating values
   (HHVs) of torrefied biomass were 20.90-25.07 MJ/kg which is an similar
   to 6\%-31\% increase, compared to the HHV of raw biomass. The energy
   yields of torrefied biomass, 67.03\%-90.06\%, implied that most energy
   was retained in the torrefied biomass. One linear model as a function of
   reaction temperature and time was developed to predict the energy yield.
   Mass and energy balance analysis showed that the total energy recovery
   was, similar to 79\%-88\%, implying that the microwave torrefaction of

Abstract = {{In a multiple transmit antenna, single antenna per receiver downlink
   channel with limited channel state feedback, we consider the following
   question: given a constraint on the total system-wide feedback load, is
   it preferable to get low-rate/coarse channel feedback from a large
   number of receivers or high-rate/high-quality feedback from a smaller
   number of receivers? Acquiring feedback from many receivers allows
   multi-user diversity to be exploited, while high-rate feedback allows
   for very precise selection of beamforming directions. We show that there
   is a strong preference for obtaining high-quality feedback, and that
   obtaining near-perfect channel information from as many receivers as
   possible provides a significantly larger sum rate than collecting a few
   feedback bits from a large number of users. In terms of system design,
   this corresponds to a preference for acquiring high-quality feedback

   coarse feedback from many users on each block.}},

Abstract = {{Energy is the most precious resource in sensor networks. The ability to
   move energy around makes it feasible to build distributed energy storage

   energy storage and routing devices) and related energy access and
   network protocols. In a nutshell, energy routers exchange energy sharing
   control information using their data network while sharing energy freely
   among connected embedded sensor devices using their energy network. To
   improve sharing efficiency subject to energy leakage, we develop an
   effective energy charging and discharging mechanism using an array of
   ultra-capacitors as the main component of an energy router. We
   extensively evaluate our system under seven real-world settings. Results
   indicate our charging and discharging control can effectively minimize
   the energy leaked away. Moreover, the energy sharing protocol can

Abstract = {{In this study, 97 microalgal strains purchased from algae bank and 50
   microalgal strains isolated from local waters in Minnesota were screened
   for their adaptability growing on a 20-fold diluted digested swine
   manure wastewater (DSMW). A pool of candidate strains well adapted to
   the DSMW was established through a high-throughput screening process.
   Two top-performing facultative heterotrophic strains with high growth
   rate (0.536 day(-1) for UMN 271 and 0.433 day(-1) for UMN 231) and one
   strain with high omega-3 unsaturated fatty acid (EPA, 3.75 \% of total
   fatty acids for UMN 231) were selected. Subsequently, a sequential
   two-stage mixo-photoautotrophic culture strategy was developed for
   biofuel and animal feed production as well as simultaneous swine
   wastewater treatment using above two strains. The maximal biomass
   concentration and lipid content at the first and second stages reached
   2.03 g/L and 23.0 \%, and 0.83 g/L and 19.0 \% for UMN 271 and UMN 231,
   respectively. The maximal nutrient removals for total phosphorus and
   ammonia after second-stage cultivation were 100 and 89.46 \%,
   respectively. The experiments showed that this sequential two-stage
   cultivation process has great potential for economically viable and
   environmentally friendly production of both renewable biofuel and
   high-value animal feed and at the same time for animal wastewater
   treatment.}},

Abstract = {{Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are naturally-occurring molecules that
   exhibit strong antibiotic properties against numerous infectious
   bacterial strains. Because of their unique mechanism of action, they
   have been touted as a potential source for novel antibiotic drugs. We
   present a summary of computational investigations in our lab aimed at
   understanding this unique mechanism of action, in particular the
   development of models that provide a quantitative connection between
   molecular-level biophysical phenomena and relevant biological effects.
   Our work is focused on protegrins, a potent class of AMPs that attack
   bacteria by associating with the bacterial membrane and forming
   transmembrane pores that facilitate the unrestricted transport of ions.
   Using fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have computed
   the thermodynamics of peptide-membrane association and insertion, as
   well as peptide aggregation. We also present a multi-scale analysis of
   the ion transport properties of protegrin pores, ranging from atomistic
   molecular dynamics simulations to mesoscale continuum models of
   single-pore electrodiffusion to models of transient ion transport from
   bacterial cells. Overall, this work provides a quantitative mechanistic
   description of the mechanism of action of protegrin antimicrobial
   peptides across multiple length and time scales.}},

   10.1152/japplphysiol.00163.2012.-Functional values of LogSD of the
   ventilation distribution (sigma((V) over dot)) have been reported
   previously, but functional values of LogSD of the perfusion distribution
   (sigma((q) over dot)) and the coefficient of correlation between
   ventilation and perfusion (rho) have not been measured in humans. Here,
   we report values for sigma((V) over dot)., sigma((q) over dot), and rho
   obtained from wash-in data for three gases, helium and two soluble
   gases, acetylene and dimethyl ether. Normal subjects inspired gas
   containing the test gases, and the concentrations of the gases at
   end-expiration during the first 10 breaths were measured with the
   subjects at rest and at increasing levels of exercise. The regional
   distribution of ventilation and perfusion was described by a bivariate
   log-normal distribution with parameters sigma((V) over dot), sigma((q)
   over dot), and rho, and these parameters were evaluated by matching the
   values of expired gas concentrations calculated for this distribution to
   the measured values. Values of cardiac output and LogSD
   ventilation/perfusion ((V) over dotA/(Q) over dot) were obtained. At
   rest, sigma((q) over dot) is high (1.08 +/- 0.12). With the onset of
   ventilation, sigma((q) over dot) decreases to 0.85 +/- 0.09 but remains
   higher than sigma((V) over dot) (0.43 +/- 0.09) at all exercise levels.
   Rho increases to 0.87 +/- 0.07, and the value of LogSD (V) over dotA/(Q)
   over dot for light and moderate exercise is primarily the result of the
   difference between the magnitudes of sigma((q) over dot) and sigma((V)
   over dot). With known values for the parameters, the bivariate
   distribution describes the comprehensive distribution of ventilation and
   perfusion that underlies the distribution of the (V) over dotA/(Q) over
   dot ratio.}},

Title = {{Effect of Inlet Skew on Heat/Mass Transfer From a Simulated Turbine
   Blade}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF TURBOMACHINERY-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Heat (mass) transfer experiments are conducted to study the effect of an
   inlet skew on a simulated gas-turbine blade placed in a linear cascade.
   The inlet skew simulates the relative motion between rotor and stator
   endwalls in a single turbine stage. The transverse motion of a belt,
   placed parallel to and upstream of the turbine cascade, generates the
   inlet skew. With the freestream velocity constant at approximately 16
   m/s, which results in a Reynolds number (based on the blade chord length
   of 0.184 m) of 1.8 x 10(5), a parametric study was conducted for three
   belt-to-freestream velocity ratios. The distribution of the Sherwood
   number on the suction surface of the blade shows that the inlet skew
   intensifies the generation of the horseshoe vortex close to the endwall
   region. This is associated with the development of a stronger passage
   vortex for a higher velocity ratio, which causes an earlier transition
   to turbulence. Corresponding higher mass transfer coefficients are
   measured between the midheight of the blade and the endwall, at a
   mid-chord downstream location. However, a negligible variation in
   transport properties is measured above the two-dimensional region of the
   blade at the higher velocity ratios. In contrast, the inlet skew has a
   negligible effect on the distribution of the Sherwood number on the
   entire pressure surface of the blade. This is mainly because the skew is
   directed along the passage vortex, which is from the pressure surface of
   the airfoil to the suction surface of the adjacent airfoil. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{We consider settings in which a revenue manager controls bookings over a
   sequence of flights. The revenue manager uses a buy-up model to select
   booking limits and updates estimates of the model parameters as data are
   accumulated. The buy-up model we consider is based upon a simple model
   of customer choice, wherein each low-fare customer who is not able to
   purchase a low-fare ticket will, with a fixed probability, buy up to the
   high fare, independent of everything else. We analyze the evolution of
   the parameter estimates (e.g., the buy-up probability) and chosen
   booking limits in situations where the buy-up model is misspecified,
   that is, in situations where there is no setting of its parameters for
   which its objective function gives an accurate representation of
   expected revenue as a function of the booking limit. The analysis is
   motivated by the common situation in which a revenue manager does not
   know precisely how customers behave but nevertheless uses a parametric
   model to make decisions. Under some assumptions, we prove that the
   booking limits and parameter estimates converge and we compare the
   actual expected revenue at the limiting values with that associated with
   the booking limits that would be chosen if the revenue manager knew the
   actual behavior of customers. The analysis shows that the buy-up model
   often works reasonably well even when it is misspecified, and also
   reveals the importance of understanding how parameter estimates of
   misspecified models vary as functions of decisions.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and elasticity of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) have been
   experimentally and theoretically studied. From high-pressure X-ray
   diffraction experiments, the bulk modulus of 102(6) and 110(3) GPa were
   obtained by fitting second- and third-order finite strain equation of
   state, respectively. First-principles calculations with a generalized
   gradient approximation gave an isotropic bulk modulus of 102.1 GPa and
   an isothermal bulk modulus of 106.0 GPa. The static calculations using
   the exchange-correlation functional show an excellent agreement with the
   experimental measurements. Based on the agreement, accurate elastic
   constants and other elastic moduli were computed. The slight difference
   of behavior at high pressure can be explained by the infiltration of
   pressure-transmitting silicone oil into structural holes in C3A. The
   computed elastic and mechanical properties will be useful in
   understanding structural and mechanical properties of cementitious
   materials, particularly with the increasing interest in the advanced
   applications at the nanoscale.}},

   of adsorbed pyridine and temperature programmed desorption (TPD) of
   2-propanamine, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, and 2-methyl-2-propanol,
   together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Following
   room-temperature adsorption and evacuation, the surface coverages of the
   adsorbed alcohols were between 2 and 3.2 x 10(18) molecules/m(2). For
   each of the adsorbed alcohols, reaction to olefin and water products
   occurred in a narrow peak that indicated reaction is a first-order
   process with a well-defined activation energy, which in turn depended
   strongly on the particular alcohol. DFT calculations on an Al8O12
   cluster are in excellent agreement with the experimental observations
   and show that the transition states for dehydration had carbenium-ion
   character. The carbenium ion stability in terms of proton affinity (of
   alkenes) matches well with the activation energy of the dehydration
   reaction. Adsorption of water on the gamma-Al2O3, followed by evacuation
   at 373 K, demonstrated that water simply blocks sites for the alcohols
   without affecting the reaction activation energy. There was no evidence
   for Bronsted sites on the gamma-Al2O3 based on FTIR of pyridine or TPD
   of 2-propanamine.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive tissue-level forces communicated to the microstructure and
   extracellular matrix of soft tissues can lead to damage and failure
   through poorly understood physical processes that are multiscale in
   nature. In this work, we propose a multiscale mechanical model for the
   failure of collagenous soft tissues that incorporates spatial
   heterogeneity in the microstructure and links the failure of discrete
   collagen fibers to the material response of the tissue. The model, which
   is based on experimental failure data derived from different collagen
   gel geometries, was able to predict the mechanical response and failure
   of type I collagen gels, and it demonstrated that a fiber-based rule (at
   the micrometer scale) for discrete failure can strongly shape the
   macroscale failure response of the gel (at the millimeter scale). The
   model may be a useful tool in predicting the macroscale failure
   conditions for soft tissues and engineered tissue analogs. In addition,
   the multiscale model provides a framework for the study of failure in
   complex fiber-based mechanical systems in general. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{The self-consistent method of lattice dynamics (SCLD) is used to obtain
   an analytical solution for the free energy of a periodic,

   anharmonic effects. For nearest-neighbor interactions, a closed-form
   analytical solution is obtained. In the case where more distant
   interactions are considered, a system of coupled nonlinear algebraic
   equations is obtained (as in the standard SCLD method) however with the
   number of equations dramatically reduced. The analytical SCLD solutions
   are compared with a numerical evaluation of the exact solution for
   simple cases and with molecular dynamics simulation results for a large
   system. The advantages of SCLD over methods based on the harmonic
   approximation are discussed as well as some limitations of the approach.}},

Abstract = {{To understand the effect of processing and co-monomer content on
   interfacial adhesion, we quantified adhesion levels of bilayers of a
   polyethylene (PE) with various polypropylenes (PPs) prepared using
   bilayer co-extrusion and lamination processes. We tested adhesion
   between a medium-density PE (MDPE) with different types of PPs,
   including impact-modified PP (with various amount of ethylene),
   isotactic PP and ethylene-propylene random copolymers. Increasing the
   concentration of ethylene or ethylene-propylene rubber gave rise to
   increased adhesion. The impact-modified PP with 20 wt\% ethylene content
   exhibited adhesion with MDPE almost two orders of magnitude higher
   compared with other PPs. Although lamination and co-extrusion processes
   showed good agreement in these trends with ethylene content, the
   operation parameters are critical for adhesion control. For lamination,
   ice-water cooling generated a stronger adhesion than that with air
   cooling. Faster cooling rates in co-extrusion also gave rise to stronger
   adhesion. Increasing draw down ratio and varying flow rate to put the
   interface near the wall resulted in stronger adhesion. Fast quenching
   rate and increased crystallinity induced by drawing down are believed to
   be the causes. Both atomic force microscopy and transmission electron
   microscopic images exhibited roughened interfaces for samples with
   strong adhesion. Polymer Journal (2012) 44, 939-945;

Abstract = {{Microalgae can be converted to an energy-dense bio-oil via pyrolysis;
   however, the relatively high nitrogen content of this bio-oil presents a
   challenge for its direct use as fuels. Therefore, hydrothermal
   pretreatment was employed to reduce the N content in Nannochloropsis
   oculata feedstock by removing proteins without requiring significant
   energy inputs. The effects of reaction conditions on the yield and
   composition of pretreated algae were investigated by varying the
   temperature (150-225 degrees C) and reaction time (10-60 min). Compared
   with untreated algae, pretreated samples had higher carbon contents and
   enhanced heating values under all reaction conditions and 6-42\% lower N
   contents at 200-225 degrees C for 30-60 min. The pyrolytic bio-oil from
   pretreated algae contained less N-containing compounds than that from
   untreated samples and the bio-oil contained mainly (44.9\% GC-MS peak
   area) long-chain fatty acids (C14-C18) which can be more readily
   converted into hydrocarbon fuels in the presence of simple catalysts.

Abstract = {{We consider the design of optimal localized feedback gains for
   one-dimensional formations in which vehicles only use information from
   their immediate neighbors. The control objective is to enhance coherence
   of the formation by making it behave like a rigid lattice. For the
   single-integrator model with symmetric gains, we establish convexity,
   implying that the globally optimal controller can be computed
   efficiently. We also identify a class of convex problems for
   double-integrators by restricting the controller to symmetric position
   and uniform diagonal velocity gains. To obtain the optimal non-symmetric
   gains for both the single- and the double-integrator models, we solve a
   parameterized family of optimal control problems ranging from an easily
   solvable problem to the problem of interest as the underlying parameter
   increases. When this parameter is kept small, we employ perturbation
   analysis to decouple the matrix equations that result from the
   optimality conditions, thereby rendering the unique optimal feedback
   gain. This solution is used to initialize a homotopy-based Newton's
   method to find the optimal localized gain. To investigate the
   performance of localized controllers, we examine how the coherence of
   large-scale stochastically forced formations scales with the number of
   vehicles. We establish several explicit scaling relationships and show
   that the best performance is achieved by a localized controller that is
   both non-symmetric and spatially-varying.}},

Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{2235-2249}},

Abstract = {{We consider distributed consensus and vehicular formation control
   problems. Specifically we address the question of whether local feedback
   is sufficient to maintain coherence in large-scale networks subject to
   stochastic disturbances. We define macroscopic performance measures
   which are global quantities that capture the notion of coherence; a
   notion of global order that quantifies how closely the formation
   resembles a solid object. We consider how these measures scale
   asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices
   in 1, 2, and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to
   the 1-D case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial
   dimension implies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a
   dimensions of 3 being necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and
   vehicular formations under certain conditions. In particular, we show
   that it is impossible to have large coherent 1-D vehicular platoons with
   only local feedback. We analyze these effects in terms of the underlying
   energetic modes of motion, showing that they take the form of large
   temporal and spatial scales resulting in an accordion-like motion of
   formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in low spatial dimensions,
   local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale disturbances, but it
   can in higher spatial dimensions. This phenomenon is distinct from, and
   unrelated to string instability issues which are commonly encountered in
   control problems for automated highways.}},

Abstract = {{Sparse data models, where data is assumed to be well represented as a
   linear combination of a few elements from a dictionary, have gained
   considerable attention in recent years, and their use has led to
   state-of-the-art results in many signal and image processing tasks. It
   is now well understood that the choice of the sparsity regularization
   term is critical in the success of such models. Based on a codelength
   minimization interpretation of sparse coding, and using tools from
   universal coding theory, we propose a framework for designing sparsity
   regularization terms which have theoretical and practical advantages
   when compared with the more standard l(0) or l(1) ones. The presentation
   of the framework and theoretical foundations is complemented with
   examples that show its practical advantages in image denoising, zooming
   and classification.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents a new problem along with our new algorithm for a
   multi-robot formation with minimally controlled conditions. For
   multi-robot cooperation, there have traditionally been prevailing
   assumptions in order to collect the necessary information. These
   assumptions include the existence of communication systems among the
   robots or the use of specialized sensors such as laser scanners or
   omnidirectional cameras. However, they are not always valid, especially
   in emergency situations or with miniature robots. We, therefore, need to
   deal with the conditions that have received less attention in research
   regarding a multi-robot formation. There are several challenges: (1)
   less information is available than the well-known formation algorithms
   assume, (2) following strategies for deformable shapes in a formation
   with only local information available are needed, and (3) target
   segmentation without any markers is required. This work presents a
   formation algorithm based on a visual tracking algorithm, including how
   to process the image measurements provided by a single monocular camera.
   Through several experiments with real robots (developed at the
   University of Minnesota), we show that the proposed algorithms work well
   with minimal sensing information.}},

Abstract = {{Technology foresight is a process that identifies the critical
   technologies a country or industry needs to develop in order to shape a
   desired future. In this paper, a two-stage technology foresight approach
   is proposed. During the first stage, critical technologies are
   identified and evaluated by nationwide experts through Delphi surveys.
   In the second stage, a system dynamics simulation model is used to
   estimate how critical parameter values are likely to impact the
   attainment of foresight goals. A detailed illustration of this two-stage
   process is provided by a technology foresight case study in the Chinese
   information and communication technologies (ICT) industry. Because it
   was identified by the first-stage Delphi method as a critical
   technology, the diffusion of 4th generation wireless telecommunication
   technology (4G) was simulated, and experimentation was conducted.
   Suggestions are provided regarding how the Chinese information industry
   would need to expand the IP network infrastructure in order to support
   technology foresight goals under different scenarios. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Due to high vehicle velocities rural intersections have a
   disproportionately high rate of fatalities. The current study examines
   the transition from an infrastructure-based rural intersection crossing
   assist system to one located inside a vehicle. Moreover, we investigate
   the efficacy of the in-vehicle system. Three different designs of the
   assist system were examined regarding their impact on driving
   performance and applicability to varying age groups and visibility
   conditions. These designs differed in terms of their complexity based on
   the amount of information that drivers received about the intersection
   traffic. Seventy-two older and younger participants divided into the
   three design groups crossed a busy rural intersection in a simulated
   environment. Drivers completed four blocks of trials in which the
   presence of the assist system and visibility conditions (limited, clear)
   were counterbalanced. When presented with the assist system drivers were
   less likely to accept a smaller gap, especially under low-visibility
   conditions. The design of the assist system that resulted in the best
   overall intersection crossing performance was also the most informative
   about the traffic. Older drivers exhibited some benefits from the
   presence of the assist system, although not to the same extent as the
   younger drivers. The results suggest that some infrastructure-based
   assist or information display systems could successfully be transitioned
   to inside a vehicle. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, the effect of light intensity on biomass accumulation,
   wastewater nutrient removal through algae cultivation, and biodiesel
   productivity was investigated with algae species Chlorella kessleri and
   Chlorella protothecoide. The light intensities studied were 0, 15, 30,
   60, 120, and 200?mu mol?m-2?s-1. The results showed that light intensity
   had profound impact on tested responses for both strains, and the
   dependence of these responses on light intensity varied with different
   algae strains. For C. kessleri, the optimum light intensity was 120?mu
   mol?m-2?S-1 for all responses except for COD removal. For C.
   protothecoide, the optimum light intensity was 30?mu mol?m-2?S-1. The
   major components of the biodiesel produced from algae biomass were 16-C
   and 18-C FAME, and the highest biodiesel contents were 24.19\% and
   19.48\% of dried biomass for C. kessleri and C. protothecoide,
   respectively. Both species were capable of wastewater nutrients removal
   under all lighting conditions with high removal efficiencies.

Abstract = {{Cells are routinely cryopreserved for investigative and therapeutic
   applications. The most common cryoprotective agent (CPA), dimethyl
   sulfoxide (DMSO), is toxic, and must be removed before cells can be
   used. This study uses a microfluidic device in which three streams flow
   vertically in parallel through a rectangular channel 500?mu m in depth.
   Two wash streams flow on either side of a DMSO-laden cell stream,
   allowing DMSO to diffuse into the wash and be removed, and the washed
   sample to be collected. The ability of the device to extract DMSO from a
   cell stream was investigated for sample flow rates from 0.5 to
   4.0?mL/min (Pe?=?1,26310,100). Recovery of cells from the device was
   investigated using Jurkat cells (lymphoblasts) in suspensions ranging
   from 0.5\% to 15\% cells by volume. Cell recovery was >95\% for all
   conditions investigated, while DMSO removal comparable to a previously
   developed two-stream device was achieved in either one-quarter the
   device length, or at four times the flow rate. The high cell recovery is
   a similar to 25\% improvement over standard cell washing techniques, and
   high flow rates achieved are uncommon among microfluidic devices,
   allowing for processing of clinically relevant cell populations.

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider using actors to maintain the quality of
   sensing in the wireless sensor networks. Due to factors such as battery
   drainage or physical malfunctions, the number of available sensors
   normally decreases over time after initial deployment, resulting in
   performance degradation. To maintain the quality of sensing in the
   network, actors can be used to allocate spare sensors to
   sensor-deficient regions (sensor allocation) or to relocate sensors from
   sensor-abundant regions to sensor-deficient regions (sensor relocation).
   We first focus on the sensor allocation problem. We introduce a baseline
   centralized greedy algorithm (GA) for sensor allocation, where global
   sensor information is communicated to obtain the optimal solution. As GA
   is only efficient for small networks, we proceed to design a distributed
   patrolling algorithm for achieving global optimization (DPAG) by using
   only local information. We then extend our work to the application
   scenario of sensor relocation by proposing a modified GA and DPAG (M-GA
   and M-DPAG), respectively. Extensive simulation results are provided to
   demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{We study the formation of the mitral vortex ring during early diastolic
   filling in a patient-specific left ventricle using direct numerical
   simulation. The geometry of the left ventricle is reconstructed from
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). The heart wall motion is modeled by a
   cell-based activation methodology, which yields physiologic kinematics
   with heart rate equal to 52 beats per minute. We show that the structure
   of the mitral vortex ring consists of the main vortex ring and trailing
   vortex tubes, which originate at the heart wall. The trailing vortex
   tubes play an important role in exciting twisting circumferential
   instability modes of the mitral vortex ring. At the end of diastole, the
   vortex ring impinges on the wall and the intraventricular flow
   transitions to a weak turbulent state. Our results can be used to help
   interpret and analyze three-dimensional in-vivo flow measurements
   obtained with MRI. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The slip correction parameter measured by Kim et al. (2005) is
   re-evaluated with the newly issued current smallest standard reference
   material SRM (R) 1964 (PSL 60.39 nm). The same experimental method
   utilizing the electrical mobility technique under low pressure condition
   is used. From the measured peak voltages at low pressures down to 8.63
   kPa (Kn=81), slip correction factor (C) is calculated, and then the slip
   correction parameter (A) is obtained by nonlinear curve fitting. The
   parameter A is 1.165 + 0.480 exp(-1.001/Kn) with the asymptotic value of
   1.645 for the free molecular regime, which corresponds to a diffuse
   reflection fraction of 0.873. The value of A is at most 0.1\% different
   from the value reported by Kim et al. (2005) 1.165 + 0.483
   exp(-0.997/Kn) and the uncertainty is reduced by about 0.5\% to a value
   of about 1.5\%. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this work was to study in silico how iris root rotation
   due to spontaneous blinking alters the iris contour. An axisymmetric
   finite-element model of the anterior segment was developed that included
   changes in the iris contour and the aqueous humor flow. The model
   geometry was based on average values of ocular dimensions. Blinking was
   modeled by rotating the iris root posteriorly and returning it back to
   the anterior. Simulations with maximum rotations of 2 degrees, 4
   degrees, 6 degrees, and 8 degrees were performed. The iris-lens contact
   distance and the pressure difference between the posterior and anterior
   chambers were calculated. When the peak iris root rotation was 2
   degrees, the maximum iris-lens contact increased gradually from 0.28 to
   0.34 mm within eight blinks. When the iris root was rotated by 6 degrees
   and 8 degrees, the pressure difference between the posterior and
   anterior chambers dropped from a positive value (1.23 Pa) to negative
   values (-0.86 and -1.93 Pa) indicating the presence of reverse pupillary
   block. Apparent iris-lens contact increased with steady blinking, and
   the increase became more pronounced as posterior rotation increased. We
   conclude that repeated iris root rotation caused by blinking could
   maintain the iris in a posterior position under normal circumstances,
   which would then lead to the clinically observed anterior drift of the
   iris when blinking is prevented. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Measuring Ambiguity in HLA Typing Methods}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 29}},
Abstract = {{In hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, donor selection is based
   primarily on matching donor and patient HLA genes. These genes are
   highly polymorphic and their typing can result in exact allele
   assignment at each gene (the resolution at which patients and donors are
   matched), but it can also result in a set of ambiguous assignments,
   depending on the typing methodology used. To facilitate rapid
   identification of matched donors, registries employ statistical
   algorithms to infer HLA alleles from ambiguous genotypes. Linkage
   disequilibrium information encapsulated in haplotype frequencies is used
   to facilitate prediction of the most likely haplotype assignment. An HLA
   typing with less ambiguity produces fewer high-probability haplotypes
   and a more reliable prediction. We estimated ambiguity for several HLA
   typing methods across four continental populations using an information
   theory-based measure, Shannon's entropy. We used allele and haplotype
   frequencies to calculate entropy for different sets of 1,000 subjects
   with simulated HLA typing. Using allele frequencies we calculated an
   average entropy in Caucasians of 1.65 for serology, 1.06 for allele
   family level, 0.49 for a 2002-era SSO kit, and 0.076 for single-pass
   SBT. When using haplotype frequencies in entropy calculations, we found
   average entropies of 0.72 for serology, 0.73 for allele family level,
   0.05 for SSO, and 0.002 for single-pass SBT. Application of haplotype
   frequencies further reduces HLA typing ambiguity. We also estimated
   expected confirmatory typing mismatch rates for simulated subjects. In a
   hypothetical registry with all donors typed using the same method, the
   entropy values based on haplotype frequencies correspond to confirmatory
   typing mismatch rates of 1.31\% for SSO versus only 0.08\% for SBT.
   Intermediate-resolution single-pass SBT contains the least ambiguity of
   the methods we evaluated and therefore the most certainty in allele
   prediction. The presented measure objectively evaluates HLA typing
   methods and can help define acceptable HLA typing for donor recruitment.}},

Abstract = {{The use of colloidal crystals with various primary particle sizes as
   templates leads to the formation of three-dimensionally ordered
   mesoporous (3DOm) carbons containing spherical pores with tailorable
   pore size and extremely high pore volumes. We present a comprehensive
   structural characterization of these novel carbons by using nitrogen
   (774 K) and, argon (87.3 K) adsorption coupled with the application of
   novel, dedicated quenched solid density functional theory (QSDFT)
   methods which assume correctly the underlying spherical pore geometry
   and also the underlying adsorption mechanism. The observed adsorption
   isotherms are of Type IV with Type Hi like hysteresis, despite the fact
   that pore blocking affects the position of the desorption branch. This
   follows also from detailed, advanced scanning hysteresis experiments
   which not only allow one to identify the underlying mechanisms of
   hysteresis, but also provide complementary information about the texture
   of these unique porous materials. This work addresses the problem of
   pore size analysis of novel, ordered porous carbons and highlights the
   importance of hysteresis scanning experiments for textural analysis of
   the pore network.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental switching energy limitations for waveguide coupled
   graphene-on-graphene optical modulators are described. The minimum
   energy is calculated under the constraints of fixed insertion loss and
   extinction ratio. Analytical relations for the switching energy both for
   realistic structures and in the quantum capacitance limit are derived
   and compared with numerical simulations. The results show that
   sub-femtojoule per bit switching energies and peak-to-peak voltages less
   than 0.1 V are achievable in graphene-on-graphene optical modulators
   using the constraint of 3 dB extinction ratio and 3 dB insertion loss.
   The quantum-capacitance limited switching energy for a single TE-mode
   modulator geometry is found to be < 0.5 fJ/bit at lambda = 1.55 mu m,
   and the dependences of the minimum energy on the waveguide geometry,
   wavelength, and graphene location are investigated. The low switching
   energy is a result of the very strong optical absorption in graphene,
   and the extremely-small operating voltages needed as the device
   approaches the quantum capacitance regime. (C) 2012 Optical Society of

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{109}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Although pinning of domain walls in ferromagnets is ubiquitous, the
   absence of an appropriate characterization tool has limited the ability
   to correlate the physical and magnetic microstructures of ferromagnetic
   films with specific pinning mechanisms. Here, we show that the pinning
   of a magnetic vortex, the simplest possible domain structure in soft
   ferromagnets, is strongly correlated with surface roughness, and we make
   a quantitative comparison of the pinning energy and spatial range in
   films of various thickness. The results demonstrate that thickness
   fluctuations on the lateral length scale of the vortex core diameter,

   ability to produce large amounts of defect-free Si NCs by means of a

   rf plasma-assisted decomposition of silane with additional hydrogen gas
   injected into the afterglow region of the plasma exhibit immediately
   after synthesis the lowest reported defect density, corresponding to a
   value of only about 0.002-0.005 defects per NC for Si NCs of 4 nm size.
   In addition, the virtually perfect hydrogen termination of these Si NCs
   yields an enhanced resistance against natural oxidation in comparison to
   Si NCs with nearly one order of magnitude larger initial defect density.}},

Title = {{TNFR1 Signaling Is Associated with Backbone Conformational Changes of
   Receptor Dimers Consistent with Overactivation in the R92Q TRAPS Mutant}},
Journal = {{BIOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Number = {{33}},
Pages = {{6545-6555}},

Abstract = {{The widely accepted model for tumor necrosis factor 1 (TNFR1) signaling
   is that ligand binding causes receptor trimerization, which triggers a
   reorganization of cytosolic domains and thus initiates intracellular
   signaling. This model of stoichiometrically driven receptor activation
   does not account for the occurrence of ligand independent signaling in
   overexpressed systems, nor does it explain the constitutive activity of
   the R92Q mutant associated with TRAPS. More recently, ligand binding has
   been shown to result in the formation of high molecular weight,
   oligomeric networks. Although the dimer, shown to be the preligand
   structure, is thought to remain present within ligand-receptor networks,
   it is unknown whether network formation or ligand-induced structural
   change to the dimer itself is the trigger for TNFR1 signaling. In the
   present study, we investigate the available crystal structures of TNFR1
   to explore backbone dynamics and infer conformational transitions
   associated with ligand binding. Using normal-mode analysis, we
   characterize the dynamic coupling between the TNFR1 ligand binding and
   membrane proximal domains and suggest a mechanism for ligand-induced
   activation. Furthermore, our data are supported experimentally by FRET
   showing that the constitutively active R92Q mutant adopts an altered
   conformation compared to wild-type. Collectively, our results suggest
   that the signaling competent architecture is the receptor dimer and that
   ligand binding modifies domain mobilities intrinsic to the receptor
   structure, allowing it to sample a separate, active conformation
   mediated by network formation.}},

Volume = {{162}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{Drug nanocarrier clearance by the immune system must be minimized to
   achieve targeted delivery to pathological tissues. There is considerable
   interest in finding in vitro tests that can predict in vivo clearance
   outcomes. In this work, we produce nanocarriers with dense PEG layers
   resulting fromblock copolymer-directed assembly during rapid
   precipitation. Nanocarriers are formed using block copolymers with
   hydrophobic blocks of polystyrene (PS), poly-epsilon-caprolactone (PCL),
   poly-D, L-lactide (PLA), or poly-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA), and
   hydrophilic blocks of polyethylene glycol (PEG) with molecular weights
   from 1kg/mol to 9kg/mol. Nanocarriers with paclitaxel prodrugs are
   evaluated in vivo in Foxn1(nu) mice to determine relative rates of
   clearance. The amount of nanocarrier in circulation after 4h varies from
   10\% to 85\% of initial dose, depending on the block copolymer. In vitro
   complement activation assays are conducted to correlate in vivo
   circulation to the protection of the nanocarrier surface from complement
   binding and activation. Guidelines for optimizing block copolymer
   structure to maximize circulation of nanocarriers formed by rapid
   precipitation and directed assembly are proposed, relating to the
   relative sizes of the hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, the
   hydrophobicity of the anchoring block, the absolute size of the PEG
   block, and polymer crystallinity. The in vitro results distinguish
   between the poorly circulating PEG(5k)-PCL9k and the better circulating
   nanocarriers, but could not rank the better circulating nanocarriers in
   order of circulation time. Analysis of PEG surface packing on
   monodisperse 200 nm latex spheres indicates that the size of the
   hydrophobic PCL, PS, and PLA blocks are correlated with the PEG blob
   size. Suggestions for next steps for in vitro measurements are made. (C)

Abstract = {{Cobalt doped/un-doped manganese oxides materials were synthesized at
   various doping rates by soft chemical reactions, oxidation-reduction
   method, which allows generating a metal-mixed oxide. The synthesized
   materials were characterized using several techniques including chemical
   analysis, X-rays diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM),
   thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and vibrating sample magnetometer
   (VSM). The chemical analysis confirmed the presence of cobalt in the
   samples. XRD patterns reveal mainly a spinel-like structure and SEM
   micrographs exhibited morphology with fine aggregate of particles. TGA
   profiles showed weight loss due to loss of water in a first step,
   followed by a loss of oxygen from the lattice associated with partial
   reduction of Mn4+ to Mn3+. VSM was used to measure the magnetization as
   a function of the applied magnetic field at temperatures T=50 and 300 K.
   Different magnetic behaviors were observed when cobalt percentage
   changed in the samples. These behaviors are considered to be related to
   the size of the particles and composition of the materials. Higher
   coercive field and lesser magnetization were observed for the sample
   with higher cobalt content. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Krylov subspace methods for computing hydrodynamic interactions in
   Brownian dynamics simulations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},

Abstract = {{Hydrodynamic interactions play an important role in the dynamics of
   macromolecules. The most common way to take into account hydrodynamic
   effects in molecular simulations is in the context of a Brownian
   dynamics simulation. However, the calculation of correlated Brownian
   noise vectors in these simulations is computationally very demanding and
   alternative methods are desirable. This paper studies methods based on
   Krylov subspaces for computing Brownian noise vectors. These methods are
   related to Chebyshev polynomial approximations, but do not require
   eigenvalue estimates. We show that only low accuracy is required in the
   Brownian noise vectors to accurately compute values of dynamic and
   static properties of polymer and monodisperse suspension models. With
   this level of accuracy, the computational time of Krylov subspace
   methods scales very nearly as O(N-2) for the number of particles N up to
   10 000, which was the limit tested. The performance of the Krylov
   subspace methods, especially the ``block{''} version, is slightly better
   than that of the Chebyshev method, even without taking into account the
   additional cost of eigenvalue estimates required by the latter.
   Furthermore, at N = 10000, the Krylov subspace method is 13 times faster
   than the exact Cholesky method. Thus, Krylov subspace methods are
   recommended for performing large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations
   with hydrodynamic interactions. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Nanoparticle collisions in the gas phase in the presence of singular
   contact potentials}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{AUG 14}},
Abstract = {{Collisional growth and ionization is commonplace for gas phase
   nanoparticles (i.e., in aerosols). Nanoparticle collisions in
   atmospheric pressure environments occur in the mass transfer transition
   regime, and further attractive singular contact potentials (which arise
   when modeling nanoparticles as condensed matter and for which the
   potential energy approaches -infinity when two entities contact) often
   have a non-negligible influence on collision processes. For these
   reasons collision rate calculations for nanoparticles in the gas phase
   are not straightforward. We use mean first passage time calculations to
   develop a simple relationship to determine the collision rate in the gas
   phase, accounting for the influences of both the transition regime and
   singular contact potentials (specifically the non-retarded van der Waals
   and image potentials). In the presented analysis, methods to determine
   the degree of enhancement in collision rate due to attractive singular
   potentials in the continuum (diffusive) regime, eta(C), and the degree
   of enhancement in the free molecular (ballistic) regime, eta(FM), are
   first reviewed. Accounting for these enhancement factors, with mean
   first passage time calculations it is found that the collision rate for
   gas phase nanoparticles with other gas phase entities can be determined
   from a relationship between the dimensionless collision rate
   coefficient, H, and the diffusive Knudsen number, Kn(D), i.e., the ratio
   of the mean collision persistence distance to the collision length
   scale. This coincides with the H(Kn(D)) relationship found to
   appropriately describe collisions between entities interacting via a
   hard-sphere potential, but with eta(C) and eta(FM) incorporated into the
   definitions of both H and Kn(D), respectively. The H(Kn(D)) relationship
   is compared to the predictions of flux matching theory, used prevalently
   in prior work for collision rate calculation, and through this
   comparison it is found that at high potential energy to thermal energy
   ratios, flux matching theory predictions underestimate the true
   collision rate. Finally, a series of experimental measurements of
   nanoparticle-nanoparticle collision rates are compared to the determined
   H(Kn(D)) expression, considering that nanoparticles interact via
   non-retarded van der Waals potentials. Very good agreement is found with
   collision rates inferred from experiments, with almost all measured
   values from four separate studies within 25\% of model predictions. (C)

Abstract = {{The design of a porous membrane support layer derived from cocontinuous
   polymer blends is presented. We investigate the effect of blend
   composition, shear rate, residence time, and annealing time on the
   cocontinuous morphology of polyethylene (PE)/poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
   blends. Porous PE sheets were generated by water extraction of PEO and
   used as a support layer for gas separation membranes. The PE/PEO blends
   using nonfunctional and maleic anhydride functional PE (PE-g-MA) were
   mixed in a batch microcompounder and in a pilot plant scale corotating
   twin-screw extruder. Using PE-g-MA resulted in pore size reduction from
   10 to 2 pm and suppression of coarsening of the morphology during
   further annealing of the blends due to formation of PE-PEO graft
   copolymers. Equilibrium interfacial tension, estimated by fitting the
   rheology of droplet blends to the Palierne viscoelastic droplet model,
   was 3 and 0.4 mN/m for PE/PEO and PE-g-MA/PEO systems, respectively. The
   specific interfacial area and phase size distribution were calculated
   from 3D images acquired by laser scanning electron microscopy (LSCM). We
   prepared gas separation membranes by solvent casting an acetone solution
   of ionic gel into porous PE sheets and discussed the effect of type of
   processing, average pore size, pore size distribution, and pore wall
   functionality on their performance.}},

Abstract = {{The DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) is capable of blocking
   retrovirus replication by editing viral cDNA and impairing reverse
   transcription. However, the biophysical details of this host-pathogen
   interaction are unclear. We applied atomic force microscopy (AFM) and
   hybrid DNA substrates to investigate properties of A3G bound to
   single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Hybrid DNA substrates included ssDNA with
   5' or 3' ends attached to DNA duplexes (tail-DNA) and gap-DNA
   substrates, in which ssDNA is flanked by two double-stranded fragments.
   We found that A3G binds with similar efficiency to the 5' and 3'
   substrates, suggesting that ssDNA polarity is not an important factor.
   Additionally, we observed that A3G binds the single-stranded region of
   the gap-DNA substrates with the same efficiency as tail-DNA. These
   results demonstrate that single-stranded DNA ends are not needed for A3G
   binding. The protein stoichiometry does not depend on the ssDNA
   substrate type, but the ssDNA length modulates the stoichiometry of A3G
   in the complex. We applied single-molecule high-speed AFM to directly
   visualize the dynamics of A3G in the complexes. We were able to
   visualize A3G sliding and protein association-dissociation events.
   During sliding, A3G translocated over a 69-nucleotide ssDNA segment in
   <1 s. Association-dissociation events were more complex, as dimeric A3G
   could dissociate from the template as a whole or undergo a two-step
   process with monomers capable of sequential dissociation. We conclude
   that A3G monomers, dimers, and higher-order oligomers can bind ssDNA
   substrates in a manner independent of strand polarity and availability
   of free ssDNA ends.}},

Volume = {{704}},
Pages = {{61-88}},
Month = {{AUG 10}},
Abstract = {{Propeller crashback is an off-design operating condition where a
   propeller rotates in the reverse direction. Experiments (Bridges 2004, T
   e c h R e p. MSSU-ASE-04-1, Department of Aerospace Engineering,
   Mississippi State University) have shown that the presence of an
   upstream hull significantly increases the side force on a propeller in
   crashback below an advance ratio of J = -0.7. Large-eddy simulation
   (LES) is performed for a propeller with and without a hull at two
   advance ratios, J = -1.0 and J = -0.5. LES reproduces the experimentally
   observed behaviour and shows good quantitative agreement. Time-averaged
   flow fields are investigated for a qualitative understanding of the
   complex flow resulting from the interaction of the upstream hull with
   the propeller blades. At J = -1.0, two noticeable flow features are
   found for the case with the hull - a recirculation zone upstream in the
   vicinity of the propeller and a vortex ring much closer to the
   propeller. In contrast, at J = -0.5, there is a much smaller
   recirculation zone which is further upstream due to the increased
   reverse flow. As a result, the hull does not make much difference in the
   immediate vicinity of the propeller at J = -0.5. For both advance
   ratios, side force is mainly generated from the leading-edge separation
   on the suction side. However, high levels of side force are also
   generated from trailing-edge separation on the suction side at J = 1.0.}},

   6-OH-PBDE 99, 6'-OH-PBDE 100, and 6'-OH-PBDE 118. Of special interest
   was 6'-OH-PBDE 118, a potential transformation product of PBDE 153 that
   is capable of photochemically generating
   2,3,7,8-tetrabromodibenzo-p-dioxin, the most toxic brominated dioxin
   congener. Photolysis experiments were conducted at two different pH
   values to assess the photochemical behavior of both the phenol and
   phenolate form of the compounds. The percent conversion to dioxin and
   other photoproducts was determined and the natural product, 6-OH-PBDE
   99, was found to have the highest conversion to dioxin (7\%). The
   reaction quantum yields ranged from 0.027 to 0.16 across all photolysis

Abstract = {{Polyurethane acrylate (PUA) are widely used as coating for automobile
   industry. Making these coatings electrically conductive would open up
   new applications. Using thermally reduced graphene (TRG) and in-situ
   polymerization we have created PUA nanocomposites with an ultralow
   percolation concentration of 0.15 wt\% (0.07 vol\%) graphene.
   Urethane-acrylate oligomer (UAO) was synthesized and diluted by
   tri-propyleneglycol diacrylate (TPGDA) to form flowable UAO/TPGDA
   mixture (UA). TRG was solvent-blended in UA to form uncured TRG/UA
   liquids and were polymerized by free radical polymerization with
   azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) initiator. Percolation concentrations of
   polymerized TRG/PUA nanocomposites occurred at 0.15 wt\% (0.07 vol\%),
   as determined by surface resistance measurements, bulk electrical
   conductivity, and modulus. TEM images revealed a homogeneous dispersion
   of TRG in PUA. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to
   monitor the polymerization of TRG/UA uncured liquids and thermal
   properties of polymerized TRG/PUA nanocomposites. Polymerization heat,
   glass transition temperature, and polymerization temperature are
   independent of TRG loading, though polymerization temperature is similar
   to 10 degrees C lower in the absence of TRG. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Instrumenting power networks with phasor measurement units (PMUs)
   facilitates several tasks including optimum power flow, system control,
   contingency analysis, visualization, and integration of renewable
   resources, thus enabling situational awareness-one of the key steps
   toward realizing the smart grid vision. The installation cost of PMUs
   currently prohibits their deployment on every bus, which in turn
   motivates their strategic placement across the power grid. As state
   estimation is at the core of grid monitoring, PMU deployment is
   optimized here based on estimation-theoretic criteria. Considering both
   voltage and incident current readings per PMU-instrumented bus and
   incorporating conventionally derived state estimates under the Bayesian
   framework, PMU placement is formulated as an optimal experimental design
   task. To bypass the combinatorial search involved, a convex relaxation
   is developed to obtain solutions with numerical optimality guarantees.
   In the tests performed on standard IEEE 14-, 30-, and 118-bus
   benchmarks, the proposed relaxation approaches and oftentimes attains
   the optimum PMU placement.}},

Abstract = {{Energy harvester based on piezoelectric nanowires, i.e., nanogenerator,
   is an innovative device to harvest the ubiquitous mechanical energy from
   the environment. The development of the nanogenerator has already shown
   promising result in powering electronics in small scale and it can
   potentially advance the renewable energy technology in large scale. In
   this review paper, we introduce briefly the mechanical-electric energy
   conversion process of piezoelectric materials. We then take an overview
   of recent research efforts on the nanogenerator based on wurtzite
   material, perovskite material, and piezoelectric polymer. The
   improvement of power output is critical and different scale-up
   techniques to integrate more functional units in a single nanogenerator
   are discussed. The integration of the nanogenerator with other
   electronic devices, such as pH sensor, UV sensor, LED, and LCD, is very
   encouraging. The research of nanogenerator may lead to a self-powered
   system, and the challenges are also noticed.}},

Abstract = {{The systematic investigation of 1-butene, trans-2-butene, cis-2-butene,
   and isobutene methylation with dimethyl ether (DME) over acidic zeolites
   FER, MFI, MOR, and BEA at low conversions (<0.1\%) and high DME:olefin
   ratios (>15:1) showed linear rate dependencies on butene pressure and no
   dependence on DME pressure. Such dependencies are consistent with the
   zeolite surface being predominantly covered by DME-derived species,
   which either directly reacts with butene species in the rate-determining
   step or through the formation and subsequent degradation of a coadsorbed
   complex. A comparison of rate constants for butene methylation across
   isomers over MFI and BEA shows that, in the absence of hydride shift, a
   10-fold increase is observed for reactants capable of forming more
   substituted carbenium ion-like transition states, as predicted for
   carbocation mediated mechanisms. High cis-2-butene pressure experiments
   over BEA show linear dependencies of the butene methylation rate on
   butene pressure for olefin to DME ratios as high as a similar to 1.5,
   indicating that surface-bound DME derived species react with butene in
   Eley-Rideal type kinetics at low temperatures. Titration with water
   after steady-state methylation of cis-2-butene over BEA results in
   DME-derived intermediates being removed as methanol in a 1:1 ratio with
   zeolite Al suggesting that surface methyl groups are involved in olefin
   methylation reactions.}},

   combination of measurement, simulation, and modeling to link this
   ``brightening{''} to a temporally enhanced quantum yield arising from

Abstract = {{Improper handling of animal manure generated from concentrated swine
   operations greatly deteriorates water ecosystems. In this study, a
   full-scale vermireactor using housefly larvae (Musca domestica) was
   designed to investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of swine manure
   reduction, and to explore the associated biochemical-biological
   mechanisms. The one-week larvae vermireactor resulted in a total weight
   reduction rate of 106 +/- 17 kg/(m(3) d) and moisture reduction of
   80.2\%. Microbial activities in manure decreased by 45\% after
   vermicomposting, while the activities of cellulose, proteases, and
   phosphatases in the vermicompost were significantly 69 times, 48\%, and
   82\% lower than those in raw manure, respectively. The vermicompost was
   exclusively dominated by Entomoplasma somnilux, Proteobacterium, and
   Clostridiaceae bacterium where the microbial diversity was decreased
   from 2.57 in raw manure to 1.77. Correlation coefficients statistic

Abstract = {{A model is developed and analyzed for type IV collagen turnover in the
   kidney glomerular basement membrane (GBM), which is the primary
   structural element in the glomerular capillary wall. The model
   incorporates strain dependence in both deposition and removal of the
   GBM, leading to an equilibrium tissue strain at which deposition and
   removal are balanced. The GBM thickening decreases tissue strain per
   unit of transcapillary pressure drop according to the law of Laplace,
   but increases the transcapillary pressure drop required to maintain
   glomerular filtration. The model results are in agreement with the
   observed GBM alterations in Alport syndrome and thin basement membrane
   disease, and the model-predicted linear relation between the inverse
   capillary radius and inverse capillary thickness at equilibrium is
   consistent with published data on different mammals. In addition, the
   model predicts a minimum achievable strain in the GBM based on the
   geometry, properties, and mechanical environment; that is, an infinitely
   thick GBM would still experience a finite strain. Although the model
   assumptions would be invalid for an extremely thick GBM, the minimum
   achievable strain could be significant in diseases, such as Alport
   syndrome, characterized by focal GBM thickening. Finally, an examination
   of reasonable values for the model parameters suggests that the oncotic
   pressure drop-the osmotic pressure difference between the plasma and the
   filtrate due to large molecules-plays an important role in setting the
   GBM strain and, thus, leakage of protein into the urine may be
   protective against some GBM damage. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4007098]}},

Title = {{A Lagrangian subgrid-scale model with dynamic estimation of Lagrangian
   time scale for large eddy simulation of complex flows}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The dynamic Lagrangian averaging approach for the dynamic Smagorinsky
   model for large eddy simulation is extended to an unstructured grid
   framework and applied to complex flows. The Lagrangian time scale is
   dynamically computed from the solution and does not need any adjustable
   parameter. The time scale used in the standard Lagrangian model contains
   an adjustable parameter theta. The dynamic time scale is computed based
   on a ``surrogate-correlation{''} of the Germano-identity error (GIE).
   Also, a simple material derivative relation is used to approximate GIE
   at different events along a pathline instead of Lagrangian tracking or
   multi-linear interpolation. Previously, the time scale for homogeneous
   flows was computed by averaging along directions of homogeneity. The
   present work proposes modifications for inhomogeneous flows. This
   development allows the Lagrangian averaged dynamic model to be applied
   to inhomogeneous flows without any adjustable parameter. The proposed
   model is applied to LES of turbulent channel flow on unstructured zonal
   grids at various Reynolds numbers. Improvement is observed when compared
   to other averaging procedures for the dynamic Smagorinsky model,
   especially at coarse resolutions. The model is also applied to flow over
   a cylinder at two Reynolds numbers and good agreement with previous
   computations and experiments is obtained. Noticeable improvement is
   obtained using the proposed model over the standard Lagrangian model.
   The improvement is attributed to a physically consistent Lagrangian time
   scale. The model also shows good performance when applied to flow past a
   marine propeller in an off-design condition; it regularizes the eddy
   viscosity and adjusts locally to the dominant flow features. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The zebrafish is a powerful experimental system for uncovering gene
   function in vertebrate organisms. Nevertheless, studies in the zebrafish
   have been limited by the approaches available for eliminating gene
   function. Here we present simple and efficient methods for inducing,
   detecting, and recovering mutations at virtually any locus in the
   zebrafish. Briefly, double-strand DNA breaks are induced at a locus of
   interest by synthetic nucleases, called TALENs. Subsequent host repair
   of the DNA lesions leads to the generation of insertion and deletion
   mutations at the targeted locus. To detect the induced DNA sequence
   alterations at targeted loci, genomes are examined using High Resolution
   Melt Analysis, an efficient and sensitive method for detecting the
   presence of newly arising sequence polymorphisms. As the DNA binding
   specificity of a TALEN is determined by a custom designed array of DNA
   recognition modules, each of which interacts with a single target
   nucleotide, TALENs with very high target sequence specificities can be
   easily generated. Using freely accessible reagents and Web-based
   software, and a very simple cloning strategy, a TALEN that uniquely
   recognizes a specific pre-determined locus in the zebrafish genome can
   be generated within days. Here we develop and test the activity of four
   TALENs directed at different target genes. Using the experimental
   approach described here, every embryo injected with RNA encoding a TALEN
   will acquire targeted mutations. Multiple independently arising
   mutations are produced in each growing embryo, and up to 50\% of the
   host genomes may acquire a targeted mutation. Upon reaching adulthood,
   approximately 90\% of these animals transmit targeted mutations to their
   progeny. Results presented here indicate the TALENs are highly
   sequence-specific and produce minimal off-target effects. In all, it
   takes about two weeks to create a target-specific TALEN and generate
   growing embryos that harbor an array of germ line mutations at a
   pre-specified locus.}},

Abstract = {{Inorganic quantum dots (QDs) have excellent optoelectronic properties.
   But, due in part to a lack of a suitable medium for dispersion, they
   have not been extensively used in optoelectronic devices. With the
   advent of organic semiconductors, the integration of quantum dots into
   optoelectronic devices has become possible. Such devices are termed as
   hybrid organic/inorganic quantum dot light emitting devices. In hybrid
   organic/inorganic quantum dot light emitting devices, the mechanisms of
   charge and/or energy transfer into the quantum dots include Forster
   energy transfer and direct charge injection. Forster energy transfer
   involves formation of excitons on organic semiconductors, followed by an
   energy transfer onto the inorganic quantum dots, where the exciton
   recombines resulting in emission of a photon. Direct charge injection is
   the mechanism in which the electrons and holes are directly injected
   into the quantum dots and they recombine on the quantum dots to result
   in a photon. Which mechanism is operating in a device has been a subject
   of contention. In this work, by using various device configurations, we
   show that both these mechanisms can operate independently to maximize
   the quantum dot light emission in such devices. (C) 2012 American

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MODELING AND COMPUTER SIMULATION}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{In this article we explain some connections between Lyapunov methods and
   subsolutions of an associated Isaacs equation for the design of
   efficient importance sampling schemes. As we shall see, subsolutions can
   be derived by taking an appropriate limit of an associated Lyapunov
   inequality. They have been recently proposed in several works of Dupuis,
   Wang, and others and applied to address several important problems in
   rare-event simulation. Lyapunov inequalities have been used for testing
   the efficiency of state-dependent importance sampling schemes in
   heavy-tailed or discrete settings in a variety of works by Blanchet,
   Glynn, and others. While subsolutions provide an analytic criterion for
   the construction of efficient samplers, Lyapunov inequalities are useful
   for finding more precise information, in the form of bounds, for the
   behavior of the coefficient of variation of the associated importance
   sampling estimator in the prelimit. In addition, Lyapunov inequalities
   provide insight into the various mollification procedures that are often
   required in constructing associated subsolutions. Our aim is to
   demonstrate that applying Lyapunov inequalities for verification of
   efficiency can help both guide the selection of various mollification
   parameters and sharpen the information on the efficiency gain induced by
   the sampler.}},

Abstract = {{The role of core block size dispersity on the rate of molecular exchange
   in spherical micelles formed from 1\% by volume
   poly(styrene-b-ethylenepropylene) (PS-PEP) diblock copolymers in
   squalane (C30H62) was investigated using time-resolved small-angle
   neutron scattering (TR-SANS). Separate copolymer solutions (total
   polymer 1\% by volume) containing either deuterium labeled (dPS) or
   normal (hPS) poly(styrene) core blocks were prepared and mixed at room
   temperature, below the core glass transition temperature. Each
   preparation (dPS or hPS) contained equal volume fractions of M-n = 26
   and 42 kg/mol (h-equivalent) poly(styrene) blocks. Heating to
   temperatures between 87 and 146 degrees C resulted in block copolymer
   exchange as evidenced by a systematic reduction in the SANS intensity;
   C30H62 and C30D62 were blended so as to contrast match the fully
   exchanged cores. Following a protocol established in a previous report,
   the time-dependent intensity data were shifted with respect to time and
   temperature, leading to a master curve covering nearly 7 orders of
   magnitude in reduced time. These results are quantitatively accounted
   for by summing the weighted relaxation functions obtained from the
   individual components, consistent with a previously published model that
   accounts for the dramatic sensitivity of the molecular exchange dynamics

Abstract = {{Three dipropenyl monomers were prepared for ruthenium-catalyzed acyclic
   diene metathesis (ADMET) polymerization. Homopolymerization afforded
   three poly(thienylene vinylene)s (PTVs) with distinct optoelectronic
   properties. Binary combinations of the monomers over a range of
   compositions gave three series of copolymer samples with tunable HOMO
   levels and band gaps. The utility of this method was further
   demonstrated by the preparation of a stoichiometric terpolymer. Polymers
   were characterized by 1H NMR spectroscopy, size-exclusion
   chromatography, ultravioletvisible spectroscopy, and cyclic voltammetry.
   This copolymerization approach effectively demonstrates the ability of
   ADMET polymerization to prepare conjugated copolymers with tuned
   optoelectronic properties that span a broad composition window.}},

Abstract = {{Wax esters are produced in certain bacteria as a potential carbon and
   energy storage compound. The final enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway
   responsible for wax ester production is the bifunctional wax ester
   synthase/acyl-coenzyme A (acyl-CoA):diacylglycerol acyltransferase
   (WS/DGAT), which utilizes a range of fatty alcohols and fatty acyl-CoAs
   to synthesize the corresponding wax ester. We report here the isolation
   and substrate range characterization for five WS/DGAT enzymes from four
   different bacteria: Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8, Acinetobacter baylyi,
   Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, and Psychrobacter cryohalolentis K5. The
   results from kinetic studies of isolated enzymes reveal a differential
   activity based on the order of substrate addition and reveal subtle
   differences between the substrate selectivity of the different enzymes.
   These in vitro results are compared to the wax ester and
   triacylglyceride product profiles obtained from each organism grown
   under neutral lipid accumulating conditions, providing potential
   insights into the role that the WS/DGAT enzyme plays in determining the
   final wax ester products that are produced under conditions of nutrient
   stress in each of these bacteria. Further, the analysis revealed that
   one enzyme in particular from M. aquaeolei VT8 showed the greatest
   potential for future study based on rapid purification and significantly
   higher activity than was found for the other isolated WS/DGAT enzymes.
   The results provide a framework to test prospective differences between
   these enzymes for potential biotechnological applications such as
   high-value petrochemicals and biofuel production.}},

Abstract = {{In the present work water soluble hemicellulosic polysaccharides HPW,
   2\% NaOH soluble hemicelluloses HP and HP, and 5\% KOH soluble fractions
   HP and HP, were classically separated from bamboo (Phyllostachys
   pubescens Mazel) aged one year. In addition to sugar composition
   analysis, the hemicelluloses were also elucidated by GPC, FTIR, NMR and
   AFM techniques. Xylose (33.70-74.09\%) and arabinose (25.03-59.04\%)
   were the main neutral sugar, with ratios of arabinose to xylose being
   between 0.34 and 1.70. GPC measurement showed that the fractions HPW, HP
   and HP precipitated in ethanol presented much broader molecular weight
   distribution. FTIR and NMR analysis suggested that the bamboo
   hemicelluloses could be mainly defined as arabinoxylans substituted by
   (1 -> 2)-linked 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronic aid and acetyl group as
   side chains. AFM images of HP revealed a distribution of both island and
   rod aggregations when 0.01 mg/mL sample in 0.1 M NH4Ac solution was
   deposited onto freshly cleared mica and air dried.}},

   Coactivation of different neurons within an isofrequency lamina of the
   inferior colliculus elicits enhanced auditory cortical activation. J
   Neurophysiol 108: 1199-1210, 2012. First published May 23, 2012;
   doi:10.1152/jn.00111.2012.-The phenomenal success of the cochlear
   implant (CI) is attributed to its ability to provide sufficient temporal
   and spectral cues for speech understanding. Unfortunately, the CI is
   ineffective for those without a functional auditory nerve or an
   implantable cochlea required for CI implementation. As an alternative,
   our group developed and implanted in deaf patients a new auditory
   midbrain implant (AMI) to stimulate the central nucleus of the inferior
   colliculus (ICC). Although the AMI can provide frequency cues, it
   appears to insufficiently transmit temporal cues for speech
   understanding. The three-dimensional ICC consists of two-dimensional
   isofrequency laminae. The single-shank AMI only stimulates one site in
   any given ICC lamina and does not exhibit enhanced activity (i.e.,
   louder percepts or lower thresholds) for repeated pulses on the same
   site with intervals <2-5 ms, as occurs for CI pulse or acoustic click
   stimulation. This enhanced activation, related to short-term temporal
   integration, is important for tracking the rapid temporal fluctuations
   of a speech signal. Therefore, we investigated the effects of
   coactivation of different regions within an ICC lamina on primary
   auditory cortex activity in ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs.
   Interestingly, our findings reveal an enhancement mechanism for
   integrating converging inputs from an ICC lamina on a fast scale (<6-ms
   window) that is compromised when stimulating just a single ICC location.
   Coactivation of two ICC regions also reduces the strong and long-term
   (>100 ms) suppressive effects induced by repeated stimulation of just a
   single location. Improving AMI performance may require at least two
   shanks implanted along the tonotopic gradient of the ICC that enables
   coactivation of multiple regions along an ICC lamina with the
   appropriate interstimulus delays.}},

Abstract = {{We examine the feasibility of the signal-to-interference-and-noise-ratio
   (SINR) guarantees for downlink transmissions in relay-enhanced OFDMA
   networks that feature stationary users. The constraints are as follows:
   (i) the SINR of every user exceeds a certain threshold and (ii) the
   transmit power for each transmission is less than a certain threshold.
   We first derive a set of necessary and sufficient feasibility conditions
   for the specific case in which a user i served by the relay station
   shares at most one subchannel with a user j served by the base station.
   These conditions are a function of the target SINR values and the
   channel gains, and derived using a property of an M-matrix. lithe
   geographical positions of the base station, the relay station, and the
   users are fixed, then our result determines the feasible SINR values for
   the users. Conversely, if these entities are not geographically fixed
   but the target SINR values are fixed, our result determines the
   geographical locations for these entities that ensure that the target
   SINR values are realized. We then extend these results to the case of
   networks featuring multiple base stations and multiple relays. Our
   conditions for checking the feasibility can be easily implemented in
   practice. Published by Elsevier Ltd}},

Abstract = {{Hepatocelltilar carcinoma (HCC) is sexually dimorphic in both rodents
   and humans, with significantly higher incidence in males, an effect that
   is dependent on sex hormones. The molecular mechanisms by which
   estrogens prevent and androgens promote liver cancer remain unclear.
   Here, we discover that sexually dimorphic HCC is completely reversed in
   Foxa1- and Foxa2-deficient mice after diethylnitrosamine-induced
   hepatocarcinogenesis. Coregulation of target genes by Foxa1/a2 and
   either the estrogen receptor (ER alpha) or the androgen receptor (AR)
   was increased during hepatocarcinogenesis in normal female or male mice,
   respectively, but was lost in Foxa1/2-deficient mice. Thus, both
   estrogen-dependent resistance to and androgen-mediated facilitation of
   HCC depend on Foxa1/2. Strikingly, single nucleotide polymorphisms at
   FOXA2 binding sites reduce binding of both FOXA2 and ER alpha to their
   targets in human liver and correlate with HCC development in women.
   Thus, Foxa factors and their targets are central for the sexual
   dimorphism of HCC. (C) 2012 European Association for the Study of the

Abstract = {{Theranostic nanoparticles (NPs) cannot reach their target tissue without
   first passing through blood; however, the influence of blood protein and
   blood cell interactions on NP biodistribution are not well understood.
   The current work shows that 30 nm PEGylated gold NPs (GNPs) interact not
   only with blood proteins as thought before but also with blood cells
   (especially platelets and monocytes) in vivo and that longer blood
   circulation correlates strongly with tumor uptake. Further, GNP surface
   properties such as negative charge or lyophilization had either a
   minimal (i.e., charge) or 15-fold increase (i.e., fresh vs lyophilized)
   in blood retention times and tumor uptake. Tumor accumulation was
   increased over 10-fold by use of a bioactive ligand (i.e., TNF) on the
   lyophilized GNP surface. Resident macrophages were primarily responsible
   for the bulk of GNP uptake in liver while spleen uptake was highly
   surface property dependent and appears to involve macrophages and
   cellular interaction between the red and white pulp. This study shows
   that the PEG layer and ligand on the surface of the NP are critical to
   blood interactions and eventual tumor and RES organ biodistribution in
   vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Apoptosis is one of the core signaling pathways disrupted in pancreatic
   ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Death receptor 5 (DR5) is a member of the
   tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-receptor superfamily that is expressed in
   cancer cells. Binding of TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)
   to DR5 is a potent trigger of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway, and
   numerous clinical trials are based on DR5-targeted therapies for cancer,
   including PDA. Human antigen R (HuR), an RNA-binding protein, regulates
   a select number of transcripts under stress conditions. Here we report
   that HuR translocates from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of PDA cells
   upon treatment with a DR5 agonist. High doses of DR5 agonist induce
   cleavage of both HuR and caspase 8. HuR binds to DR5 mRNA at the
   5'-untranslated region (UTR) in PDA cells in response to different
   cancer-associated stressors and subsequently represses DR5 protein
   expression; silencing HuR augments DR5 protein production by enabling
   its translation and thus enhances apoptosis. In PDA specimens (n = 53),
   negative HuR cytoplasmic expression correlated with elevated DR5
   expression (odds ratio 16.1, p < 0.0001). Together, these data
   demonstrate a feedback mechanism elicited by HuR-mediated repression of
   the key apoptotic membrane protein DR5.}},

Abstract = {{We recorded electrical activity from four developing embryonic brain
   cultures (4-40 days in vitro) using multielectrode arrays (MEAs) with 60
   embedded electrodes. Data were filtered for local field potentials
   (LFPs) and downsampled to 1 ms to yield a matrix of time series
   consisting of 60 electrode x 60 000 time samples per electrode per day
   per MEA. Each electrode time series was rendered stationary and
   nonautocorrelated by applying an ARIMA (25, 1, 1) model and taking the
   residuals (i.e. innovations). Two kinds of analyses were then performed.
   First, a pairwise crosscorrelation (CC) analysis (+/- 25 1 ms lags)
   revealed systematic changes in CC with lag, day in vitro (DIV), and
   inter-electrode distance. Specifically, (i) positive CCs were 1.76 x
   more prevalent and 1.44 x stronger (absolute value) than negative ones,
   and (ii) the strength of CC increased with DIV and decreased with lag
   and inter-electrode distance. Second, a network equilibrium analysis was
   based on the instantaneous (1 ms resolution) logratio of the number of
   electrodes that were above or below their mean, called simultaneous
   departure from equilibrium, SDE. This measure possesses a major
   computational advantage over the pairwise crosscorrelation approach
   because it is very simple and fast to calculate, an important factor for
   the analysis of large networks. The results obtained with SDE covaried
   highly with CC over DIV, which further validates the usefulness of this
   measure as a computationally effective tool for large scale network
   analysis.}},

Title = {{Improved spatial targeting with directionally segmented deep brain
   stimulation leads for treating essential tremor}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the ventral intermediate nucleus of
   thalamus (Vim) is known to exert a therapeutic effect on postural and
   kinetic tremor in patients with essential tremor (ET). For DBS leads
   implanted near the caudal border of Vim, however, there is an increased
   likelihood that one will also induce paresthesia side-effects by
   stimulating neurons within the sensory pathway of the ventral caudal
   (Vc) nucleus of thalamus. The aim of this computational study was to (1)
   investigate the neuronal pathways modulated by therapeutic,
   sub-therapeutic and paresthesia-inducing DBS settings in three patients
   with ET and (2) determine how much better an outcome could have been
   achieved had these patients been implanted with a DBS lead containing
   directionally segmented electrodes (dDBS). Multi-compartment neuron
   models of the thalamocortical, cerebellothalamic and medial lemniscal
   pathways were first simulated in the context of patient-specific
   anatomies, lead placements and programming parameters from three ET
   patients who had been implanted with Medtronic 3389 DBS leads. The
   models showed that in these patients, complete suppression of tremor was
   associated most closely with activating an average of 62\% of the
   cerebellothalamic afferent input into Vim (n = 10), while persistent
   paresthesias were associated with activating 35\% of the medial
   lemniscal tract input into Vc thalamus (n = 12). The dDBS lead design
   demonstrated superior targeting of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical
   pathway, especially in cases of misaligned DBS leads. Given the close
   proximity of Vim to Vc thalamus, the models suggest that dDBS will
   enable clinicians to more effectively sculpt current through and around
   thalamus in order to achieve a more consistent therapeutic effect
   without inducing side-effects.}},

Abstract = {{Multidimensional scaling (MDS) seeks an embedding of N objects in a p <
   N dimensional space such that inter-vector distances approximate
   pairwise object dissimilarities. Despite their popularity, MDS
   algorithms are sensitive to outliers, yielding grossly erroneous
   embeddings even if few outliers contaminate the available
   dissimilarities. This work introduces robust MDS approaches exploiting
   the degree of sparsity in the outliers present. Links with compressive
   sampling lead to robust MDS solvers capable of coping with unstructured
   and structured outliers. The novel algorithms rely on a
   majorization-minimization approach to minimize a regularized stress
   function, whereby iterative MDS solvers involving Lasso and sparse
   group-Lasso operators are obtained. The resulting schemes identify
   outliers and obtain the desired embedding at computational cost
   comparable to that of their nonrobust MDS alternatives. The robust
   structuredMDS algorithm considers outliers introduced by a sparse set of
   objects. In this case, two types of sparsity are exploited: i) sparsity
   of outliers in the dissimilarities; and ii) sparsity of the objects
   introducing outliers. Numerical tests on synthetic and real datasets
   illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Notwithstanding the popularity of conventional clustering algorithms
   such as K-means and probabilistic clustering, their clustering results
   are sensitive to the presence of outliers in the data. Even a few
   outliers can compromise the ability of these algorithms to identify
   meaningful hidden structures rendering their outcome unreliable. This
   paper develops robust clustering algorithms that not only aim to cluster
   the data, but also to identify the outliers. The novel approaches rely
   on the infrequent presence of outliers in the data, which translates to
   sparsity in a judiciously chosen domain. Leveraging sparsity in the
   outlier domain, outlier-aware robust K-means and probabilistic
   clustering approaches are proposed. Their novelty lies on identifying
   outliers while effecting sparsity in the outlier domain through
   carefully chosen regularization. A block coordinate descent approach is
   developed to obtain iterative algorithms with convergence guarantees and
   small excess computational complexity with respect to their non-robust
   counterparts. Kernelized versions of the robust clustering algorithms
   are also developed to efficiently handle high-dimensional data, identify
   nonlinearly separable clusters, or even cluster objects that are not
   represented by vectors. Numerical tests on both synthetic and real
   datasets validate the performance and applicability of the novel
   algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Probing signal waveforms play a central role in the signal processing
   performance of a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar. In
   practice, for a given desired beam pattern, we need to design a probing
   signal waveform whose beam pattern closely matches the desired one and
   whose autocorrelation and cross-correlation sidelobes are kept low. The
   latter properties are important to mitigate undesirable interference
   caused by multiple targets or scatterers. In this correspondence, we
   present an efficient optimization method to design a constant modulus
   probing signal which can synthesize a desired beam pattern while
   maximally suppressing both the autocorrelation and cross-correlation
   sidelobes at/between given spacial angles. We formulate this problem as
   an unconstrained minimization of a fourth order trigonometric polynomial
   and propose an efficient quasi-Newton iterative algorithm to solve it.
   Besides, we provide an analysis of the local minima of the fourth-order
   trigonometric polynomial and prove that any local minima is a
   1/2-approximation of its global optimal solution. Numerical examples
   show that the proposed approach compares favorably with the existing
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{Anti-arrhythmic drugs have narrow therapeutic ranges and typically can
   engender harmful side effects. The intrapericardial (IP) delivery of
   anti-arrhythmic agents proposes to achieve higher myocardial levels
   while minimizing plasma concentrations, thus diminishing systemic side
   effects. Furthermore, IP delivery enables concentrations at the target
   site to be more precisely controlled. Our study objective was to compare
   the relative cardiac effects of intrapericardial administration of
   metoprolol to standard intravenous (IV) delivery in a swine surgical
   model. In order to answer the question of how IP metoprolol affects
   sinus tachycardia, atrial electrophysiology, and pharmacokinetics
   compared with IV delivery, a medial sternotomy was performed on 21 swine
   that were divided into three groups: (1) After inducing sinus
   tachycardia, metoprolol boluses were delivered IP (n = 4) or IV (n = 4);
   (2) metoprolol was administered either IP (n = 3) or IV (n = 3) with
   saline controls (n = 3), and electrophysiologic data were collected; (3)
   metoprolol levels were tracked both in the blood (IV, n = 2) and
   pericardial (IP, n = 2) fluid. After either IP or IV delivery of
   metoprolol, heart rates were lowered significantly to 70\% and 73\% of
   control rate, respectively. The therapeutic effect of IV-administered
   metoprolol was considerably reduced after 1 h but was sustained longer
   in the IP group. Additionally, ventricular contractility and mean
   arterial pressure parameters were significantly lower in IV-treated
   animals but were nearly unaffected in IP-treated animals. With IP
   administration, the elimination half-life of metoprolol in pericardial
   fluid was 14.4 min with negligible accumulations in the plasma, whereas
   with IV delivery, the elimination half-life in plasma was 11.1 min with
   negligible amounts found in the pericardial fluid. The targeted
   intrapericardial delivery of metoprolol effectively lowers heart rates
   for sustained periods of time, with minimal effect on either ventricular
   contractility or mean arterial pressure. We did not observe dramatic
   changes in induced atrial fibrillation times or refractory periods using
   this model.}},

Abstract = {{A tonic-clonic seizure transitions from high frequency asynchronous
   activity to low frequency coherent oscillations, yet the mechanism of
   transition remains unknown. We propose a shift in network synchrony due
   to changes in cellular response. Here we use phase-response curves (PRC)
   from Morris-Lecar (M-L) model neurons with synaptic depression and
   gradually decrease input current to cells within a network simulation.
   This method effectively decreases firing rates resulting in a shift to
   greater network synchrony illustrating a possible mechanism of the
   transition phenomenon. PRCs are measured from the M-L conductance based
   model cell with a range of input currents within the limit cycle. A
   large network of 3000 excitatory neurons is simulated with a network
   topology generated from second-order statistics which allows a range of
   population synchrony. The population synchrony of the oscillating cells
   is measured with the Kuramoto order parameter, which reveals a
   transition from tonic to clonic phase exhibited by our model network.
   The cellular response shift mechanism for the tonic-clonic seizure
   transition reproduces the population behavior closely when compared to
   EEG data.}},

Journal = {{MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},

Volume = {{45}},

Abstract = {{Asphalt overlays provide an economical means for treating deteriorated
   pavements. Thin bonded overlay (TBO) systems have become popular options
   for pavement rehabilitation. In addition to functional improvements,
   these systems ensure a high degree of waterproofing benefits.
   Conventional asphalt concrete fracture tests were developed for
   pavements with homogeneous asphalt concrete mixtures, and typically
   their thicknesses exceed 50 mm (2 inch). The use of spray paver
   technology for construction of TBO leads to continuously varying asphalt
   binder content, up to approximately one-third of the layer thickness.
   Commonly utilized fracture test geometries for asphalt concrete include
   the single-edge notched beam, SEN{[}B], the disk-shaped compact tension,
   DC{[}T], and the semi-circular bend, SC{[}B]. The SEN{[}B] test geometry
   is not preferable for use in pavement systems due to difficulties in
   procuring beam samples from the field. Applications of the other
   established test geometries, the DC{[}T] and SC{[}B] tests, are limited
   because of the material nonhomogeneity caused by nonuniform distribution
   of asphalt binder and smaller as-constructed thicknesses of TBO, which
   are usually less than 25 mm (1 inch) for gap-graded and 50 mm (2 inch)
   for dense-graded hot mix asphalt (HMA) mixtures. Both the DC{[}T] and
   SC{[}B] tests simulate movement of the crack fronts in transverse or
   longitudinal directions in the pavement. Use of these tests on
   field-procured samples of TBO yields a crack front that encounters
   nonhomogeneous material through the specimen thickness. The crack moves
   perpendicular to the axis of material nonhomogeneity, which makes data
   interpretation and fundamental material fracture characterization
   challenging. In addition, the crack in the specimen is correlated to a
   crack channeling across the pavement width rather than a bottom-up or
   top-down direction, which is more desirable from the standpoint of
   coupling experimental results with currently available simulation
   models. This paper proposes a test procedure for fracture
   characterization of graded asphalt pavement systems that have
   significant material property gradients through their thicknesses.
   Suitable specimen geometry and testing procedures were developed using
   ASTM E399 and ASTM D7313-07b as a starting point. Laboratory tests were
   performed using an optimized compact tension, or C{[}T], test geometry
   for field cores as well as laboratory-fabricated composite specimens.
   Laboratory testing using the proposed procedure clearly showed
   distinction in the fracture characteristics for specimens prepared with
   varying material compositions. The capability of distinguishing
   different materials combined with stable crack growth makes the proposed
   testing procedure ideal for fracture characterization of thin and graded
   pavement systems. Statistical analysis of test data revealed that the
   proposed C{[}T] test procedure is capable of detecting differences in
   fracture energy results across a wide range of pavement systems and
   yields a low test variability. Finite element simulations of the test
   procedure further indicate the suitability of the test procedure as well
   as demonstrating a procedure for extraction of fundamental material
   properties.}},

Abstract = {{The symbiosis between rhizobial bacteria and legume plants has served as
   a model for investigating the genetics of nitrogen fixation and the
   evolution of facultative mutualism. We used deep sequence coverage
   (>100X) to characterize genomic diversity at the nucleotide level among
   12 Sinorhizobium medicae and 32 S. meliloti strains. Although these
   species are closely related and share host plants, based on the ratio of
   shared polymorphisms to fixed differences we found that horizontal gene
   transfer (HGT) between these species was confined almost exclusively to
   plasmid genes. Three multi-genic regions that show the strongest
   evidence of HGT harbor genes directly involved in establishing or
   maintaining the mutualism with host plants. In both species, nucleotide
   diversity is 1.5-2.5 times greater on the plasmids than chromosomes.
   Interestingly, nucleotide diversity in S. meliloti but not S. medicae is
   highly structured along the chromosome - with mean diversity (theta(pi))
   on one half of the chromosome five times greater than mean diversity on
   the other half. Based on the ratio of plasmid to chromosome diversity,
   this appears to be due to severely reduced diversity on the chromosome
   half with less diversity, which is consistent with extensive hitchhiking
   along with a selective sweep. Frequency-spectrum based tests identified
   82 genes with a signature of adaptive evolution in one species or
   another but none of the genes were identified in both species. Based
   upon available functional information, several genes identified as
   targets of selection are likely to alter the symbiosis with the host
   plant, making them attractive targets for further functional
   characterization.}},

Abstract = {{Relational descriptions have been used in formalizing diverse
   computational notions, including, for example, operational semantics,
   typing, and acceptance by non-deterministic machines. We therefore
   propose a (restricted) logical theory over relations as a language for
   specifying such notions. Our specification logic is further
   characterized by an ability to explicitly treat binding in object
   languages. Once such a logic is fixed, a natural next question is how we
   might prove theorems about specifications written in it. We propose to
   use a second logic, called a reasoning logic, for this purpose. A
   satisfactory reasoning logic should be able to completely encode the
   specification logic. Associated with the specification logic are various
   notions of binding: for quantifiers within formulas, for eigenvariables
   within sequents, and for abstractions within terms. To provide a natural
   treatment of these aspects, the reasoning logic must encode binding
   structures as well as their associated notions of scope, free and bound
   variables, and capture-avoiding substitution. Further, to support
   arguments about provability, the reasoning logic should possess strong
   mechanisms for constructing proofs by induction and co-induction. We
   provide these capabilities here by using a logic called which represents
   relations over lambda-terms via definitions of atomic judgments,
   contains inference rules for induction and co-induction, and includes a
   special generic quantifier. We show how provability in the specification
   logic can be transparently encoded in . We also describe an interactive
   theorem prover called Abella that implements and this two-level logic
   approach and we present several examples that demonstrate the efficacy
   of Abella in reasoning about computations.}},

Abstract = {{5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is an important intermediate chemical for
   producing valuable chemicals from biomass and can be synthesized with
   high yield from the dehydration of fructose in dimethyl sulfoxide

   DMSO for a cost effective recovery of the product from the reaction
   mixture that contains unreacted fructose. BP2000, Norit1240, BP1300,
   BP880 and XC72 were tested as sorbents. BP2000 and Norit1240 exhibit
   selectivity and capacity for HMF. Depending on relative concentrations.
   HMF/fructose separation factors up to 45 for BP2000 and 13 for Norit
   1240 were obtained. Under certain conditions, by increasing the
   concentration of fructose in the solution, HMF adsorption increased
   significantly. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The fabrication and evaluation of nanocomposites based on microbial
   cellulose and polyaniline (PANi) are described. Microbial cellulose, so
   called, bacterial cellulose (BC) was introduced to interfacial
   polymerization of aniline. Two different phases based on water and
   chloroform made it easy for nanosized PANi particles to be synthesized
   on BC. Without any help of a surfactant or templates, BC played a
   critical role of supporting the growth of PANi. As a function of aniline
   concentration, the corresponding PANi content and volume resistivity
   were checked. From morphological images observed by FE-SEM, PANi
   nanoparticles were densely arrayed along every fiber of BC. The
   conjugated backbone of PANi was thought to contribute to the
   improvements of thermal stability of PANi/BC composites. The stiffness
   and brittleness of PANi were compensated by more ductile BC, suggesting
   BC can be a promising substrate for it. By the simple and facile
   interfacial polymerization, the electrical conductivity of PANi/BC
   composites reached up to 3.8 x 10(-1) S/cm when 0.32 M of aniline was
   used. This PANi/BC nanocomposite can be useful in applications requiring
   biocompatibility and electrical conductivity such as biological and
   chemical sensors.}},

Abstract = {{Paper-based analytical devices are the subject of growing interest for
   the development of low-cost point-of-care diagnostics, environmental
   monitoring technologies, and research tools for limited-resource
   settings. However, there are limited chemistries available for the
   conjugation of. biomolecules to cellulose for use in biomedical
   applications. Herein, divinyl sulfone (DVS) chemistry was demonstrated
   to immobilize small molecules, proteins, and DNA covalently onto the
   hydroxyl groups of cellulose membranes through nucleophilic addition.
   Assays on modified cellulose using protein-carbohydrate and
   protein-glycoprotein interactions as well as oligonucleotide
   hybridization showed that the membrane's bioactivity was specific,
   dose-dependent, and stable over a long period of time. The use of an
   inkjet printer to form patterns of biomolecules on DVS-activated
   cellulose illustrates the adaptability of the DVS functionalization
   technique to pattern sophisticated designs, with potential applications
   in cellulose-based lateral flow devices.}},

Abstract = {{Encapsulating anticancer drugs in nanoparticles has proven to be an
   effective mechanism to alter the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
   profiles of the drugs, leading to clinically useful cancer therapeutics
   like Doxil and DaunoXome. Underdeveloped tumor vasculature and
   lymphatics allow these first-generation nanoparticles to passively
   accumulate within the tumor, but work to create the next-generation
   nanoparticles that actively participate in the tumor targeting process
   is underway. Lipid nanoparticles functionalized with targeting peptides
   are among the most often studied. The goal of this article is to review
   the recently published literature of targeted nanoparticles to highlight
   successful designs that improved in vivo tumor therapy, and to discuss
   the current challenges of designing these nanoparticles for effective in
   vivo performance.}},

Title = {{Exploring the role of organic matter accumulation on delta evolution}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{JUL 20}},
Abstract = {{We explore the role of plant matter accumulation in the sediment column
   in determining the response of fluvial-deltas to base-level rise and
   simple subsidence profiles. Making the assumption that delta building
   processes operate to preserve the geometry of the delta plain, we model
   organic sedimentation in terms of the plant matter accumulation and
   accommodation (space made for sediment deposition) rates. A spatial
   integration of the organic sedimentation, added to the known river
   sediment input, leads to a model of delta evolution that estimates the
   fraction of organic sediments preserved in the delta. The model predicts
   that the maximum organic fraction occurs when the organic matter
   accumulation rate matches the accommodation rate, a result consistent
   with field observations. The model also recovers the upper limit for
   coal accumulation previously reported in the coal literature. Further,
   when the model is extended to account for differences in plant matter
   accumulation between fresh and saline environments (i.e., methanogenesis
   versus sulfate reduction) we show that an abrupt shift in the location
   of the fresh-salt boundary can amplify the speed of shoreline retreat.}},

Abstract = {{Functionalized poly(propylene-co-ethylene) (PPE) made via reactive
   extrusion dramatically improved the performance of their blends with
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA). Adhesion, compatibility, modulus,
   hardness and scratch resistance were all increased for blends with
   functional PPEs compared to non-modified PPE, greatly expanding the
   applications of polyolefins. Three types of functional PPEs including
   maleic anhydride grafted PPE (PPE-MA), hydroxyl group grafted PPE
   (PPE-OH) and secondary amine group grafted PPE (PPE-NHR) were melt
   blended with PMMA at different compositions and with PMMA of different
   molecular weights. Compatibility of each functional PPE with PMMA was
   compared by investigating the binary blends using mechanical
   (nano-indentation, nano-scratch and tensile tests), morphological
   (scanning electron microscopy with image analysis, particle size
   analysis) and adhesion tests. Compatibility of functional PPEs with PMMA
   is confirmed consistently from various tests and ranked in a decreasing
   order as follows: PPE-NHR > PPE-OH > PPE-MA > PPE. We also drastically
   improved the compatibility and adhesion between PPE and PMMA by blending
   a small amount of PMMA grafted PPE copolymer. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The bilayer membrane permeability of block copolymer vesicles
   ({''}polymersomes{''}) with ionic liquid interiors dispersed in water is
   quantified using fluorescence quenching. Poly((1,2-butadiene)-b-ethylene
   oxide) (PB-PEO) block copolymer vesicles in water with their interiors
   filled with a common hydrophobic ionic liquid,
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide, were
   prepared containing a hydrophobic dye, Nile Red, by intact migration of
   dye-encapsulated vesicles from the ionic liquid to water at room
   temperature. A small quencher molecule, dichloroacetamide, was added to
   the aqueous solution of the dye-loaded vesicles, and the permeation of
   the quencher passing through the membrane into the interior was
   determined from the fluorescence quenching kinetics. Rapid permeation of
   the quencher across the nanoscale membrane was observed, consistent with
   the high fluidity of the liquid polybutadiene membrane. Two different
   PB-PEO copolymers were employed, in order to vary the thickness of the
   solvophobic membrane. A significant increase in membrane permeability
   was also observed with decreasing membrane thickness, which is
   tentatively attributable to differences in quencher solubility in the
   membranes. Quantitative migration of the vesicles from the aqueous phase
   back to an ionic liquid phase was achieved upon heating. These
   microscopically heterogeneous and thermoresponsive vesicles with
   permeable and robust membranes have potential as recyclable
   nanoreactors, in which the high viscosity and capital expense of an
   ionic liquid reaction medium can be mitigated, while retaining the
   desirable features of ionic liquids as reaction media, and facile
   catalyst recovery.}},

Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis is a progressive neurological disorder. that results
   in the degradation of myelin sheaths that insulate axons in the central
   nervous system. Therefore promotion of myelin repair is a major thrust
   of multiple sclerosis treatment research. Two mouse monoclonal natural
   autoantibodies, O1 and O4, promote myelin repair in several mouse models
   of multiple sclerosis. Natural autoantibodies are generally polyreactive
   and predominantly of the IgM isotype. The prevailing paradigm is that
   because they are polyreactive, these antibodies bind antigens with low
   affinities. Despite their wide use in neuroscience and glial cell
   research, however, the affinities and kinetic constants of O1 and O4
   antibodies have not been measured to date. In this work, we developed a
   membrane biosensing platform based on surface plasmon resonance in gold
   nanohole arrays with a series of surface modification techniques to form
   myelin mimicking lipid bilayer membranes to measure both the association
   and dissociation rate constants for O1 and O4 antibodies binding to
   their myelin lipid antigens. The ratio of rate constants shows that O1
   and O4 bind to galactocerebroside and sulfated galactocerebroside,
   respectively, with unusually small apparent dissociation constants (K-D
   approximate to 0.9 nM) for natural autoantibodies. This is approximately
   one to 2 orders of magnitude lower than typically observed for the
   highest affinity natural autoantibodies. We propose that the unusually
   high affinity of O1 and O4 to their targets in myelin contributes to the
   mechanism by which they signal oligodendrocytes and induce central
   nervous system repair.}},

Abstract = {{Nonuniformities, such as heavy edges or ``coffee rings{''}, frequently
   develop as particulate coatings dry. One idea for avoiding these
   nonuniformities is to engineer the substrate edges. In this work,
   monodisperse latex coatings were deposited on substrates with
   photoresist walls around their edges. Cryogenic scanning electron
   microscopy (cryoSEM) results show particle accumulation near the walls
   and at the free surface. The contact line, pinned at the wall, generates

Abstract = {{Through domestication, humans have substantially altered the morphology
   of Zea mays ssp. parviglumis ( teosinte) into the currently recognizable
   maize. This system serves as a model for studying adaptation, genome
   evolution, and the genetics and evolution of complex traits. To examine
   how domestication has reshaped the transcriptome of maize seedlings, we
   used expression profiling of 18,242 genes for 38 diverse maize genotypes
   and 24 teosinte genotypes. We detected evidence for more than 600 genes
   having significantly different expression levels in maize compared with
   teosinte. Moreover, more than 1,100 genes showed significantly altered
   coexpression profiles, reflective of substantial rewiring of the
   transcriptome since domestication. The genes with altered expression
   show a significant enrichment for genes previously identified through
   population genetic analyses as likely targets of selection during maize
   domestication and improvement; 46 genes previously identified as
   putative targets of selection also exhibit altered expression levels and
   coexpression relationships. We also identified 45 genes with altered,
   primarily higher, expression in inbred relative to outcrossed teosinte.
   These genes are enriched for functions related to biotic stress and may
   reflect responses to the effects of inbreeding. This study not only
   documents alterations in the maize transcriptome following
   domestication, identifying several genes that may have contributed to
   the evolution of maize, but highlights the complementary information
   that can be gained by combining gene expression with population genetic
   analyses.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we describe the performance of organic photovoltaic cells
   (OPVs) based on the electron donor-acceptor pairing of boron
   subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) and C-70. As an acceptor, C-70 is a
   promising alternative to C-60 due to its red-shifted absorption edge and
   large extinction coefficient, permitting increased photocurrent
   generation. In uniformly mixed OPVs based on SubPc: C-70, peak power
   conversion efficiency is realized in devices containing 80 wt.\% C-70.
   Further enhancement in device performance can be realized through the
   use of a continuously graded donor-acceptor heterojunction. The
   optimized graded heterojunction OPV shows a power conversion efficiency
   of eta(P) (5.4 +/- 0.2)\% under simulated AM1.5G solar illumination at
   100 mW/cm(2). This efficiency is significantly larger than the value of
   eta(P) (4.5 +/- 0.1)\% realized using C-60 due to a substantial increase
   in the short-circuit current density. (C) 2012 American Institute of

Abstract = {{The interior surfaces of three-dimensional open cell foams were coated
   by a combination of dip coating and spin coating. Glycerol/water
   solutions were used as model Newtonian liquids, and the coating
   processes were studied on open cell carbon foams with 10 or 30 pores per
   inch (PPI). The amount of liquid retained in the foam structures after
   dip coating increased with withdrawal speed and coating viscosity, as
   expected from the conventional understanding of dip coating onto
   nonporous substrates such as flat plates and rods. However, the liquid
   retention and hence average coating thickness increased with surface
   tension, a result counter to the observation with coating onto nonporous
   substrates. Pockets of liquid were observed after dip coating and
   results with coatings of alumina suspension showed that after drying,
   the trapped liquid can block pore windows. Spinning the foams after dip
   coating resulted in uniform liquid distribution and uniform coatings.
   Foams were placed in a special apparatus and rotated using a commercial
   spin coater. The liquid layer thickness decreased with spinning time and
   rotational speed, and increased with the liquid viscosity, results
   consistent with spin coating theory. The coating thickness after
   spinning was not affected by the initial dip coating procedure. The dip
   and spin process was also used to create gamma-alumina and zeolite
   coatings, which are of interest for catalysis applications.}},

Abstract = {{The optimum transition wavelength between high absorption and low
   emissivity for selective solar absorbers has been calculated in several
   prior treatises for an ideal system, where the emissivity is exactly
   zero in the infrared. However, no real coating can achieve such a low
   emissivity across the entire infrared with simultaneously high
   absorption in the visible. An emissivity of even a few percent radically
   changes the optimum wavelength separating the high and low absorption
   spectral bands. This behavior is described and calculated for AM0 and
   AM1.5 solar spectra with an infrared emissivity varying between 0 and
   5\%. With an emissivity of 5\%, solar concentration of 10 times the
   AM1.5 spectrum the optimum transition wavelength is found to be 1.28 mu
   m and have a 957K equilibrium temperature. To demonstrate typical
   absorptions in optimized solar selective coatings, a four-layer
   sputtered Mo and SiO2 coating with absorption of 5\% across the infrared
   is described experimentally and theoretically. (c) 2012 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Wind turbine use is expanding throughout the world as a means to provide
   electricity without contributing to the increase in global-warming
   gases. Most commonly, very large, horizontal-axis turbines are
   constructed in fleets that are connected to national-level electrical
   grid systems. More recently, there has been a desire for more local,
   small-scale power production that can be used to power very specific
   pieces of equipment or buildings. Some of the small-scale turbines are
   designed differently from their larger counterparts-they are driven by
   drag forces rather than by lift. Drag-driven turbines are typically
   called Savonius turbines. This paper, which presents a historical
   perspective on Savonius turbines, will illustrate their potential for
   providing local power. Finally, we will discuss recent developments in
   analysis methods which intend to optimize Savonius turbines for powering
   cellular communication towers in developing parts of the world. (C) 2012

Month = {{JUL-AUG}},
Abstract = {{A large portion of highway bridges in the United States are reaching or
   have reached their intended design lives. To avoid replacing a large
   number of bridges simultaneously, methodologies to safely extend their
   lives are important to help avoid high replacement costs and to schedule
   bridge replacement over a longer time window. This paper proposes an
   approach to extend the fatigue life of vulnerable steel bridges through
   a response modification apparatus, consisting of a mechanical amplifier
   and a response modification device, which provides supplemental
   stiffness and damping to the bridge. Because of the relatively small
   deflections encountered under typical service loads, the use of a
   mechanical amplifier allows for a smaller apparatus and enables a more
   efficient device to provide adequate response modification forces to the
   bridge. Herein, the use of a scissor jack as the mechanical amplifier is
   proposed for use in bridge applications, and its utility in concert with
   a passive stiffness device is demonstrated by application to a simple
   beam structure. Reductions in moment ranges of 37\% and safe life
   extensions of 300\% are achieved on a simple beam model with the
   proposed response modification apparatus. DOI:

Title = {{Computation of Probability Distribution of Strength of Quasibrittle
   Structures Failing at Macrocrack Initiation}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{138}},
Number = {{7}},
Pages = {{888-899}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Engineering structures must be designed for an extremely low failure
   probability, P-f < 10(-6). To determine the corresponding structural
   strength, a mechanics-based probability distribution model is required.
   Recent studies have shown that quasibrittle structures that fail at the
   macrocrack initiation from a single representative volume element (RVE)
   can be statistically modeled as a finite chain of RVEs. It has further
   been demonstrated that, based on atomistic fracture mechanics and a
   statistical multiscale transition model, the strength distribution of
   each RVE can be approximately described by a Gaussian distribution, onto
   which a Weibull tail is grafted at a point of the probability about
   10(-4) to 10(-3). The model implies that the strength distribution of
   quasibrittle structures depends on the structure size, varying gradually
   from the Gaussian distribution modified by a far-left Weibull tail
   applicable for small-size structures, to the Weibull distribution
   applicable for large-size structures. Compared with the classical
   Weibull strength distribution, which is limited to perfectly brittle
   structures, the grafted Weibull-Gaussian distribution of the RVE
   strength makes the computation of the strength distribution of
   quasibrittle structures inevitably more complicated. This paper presents
   two methods to facilitate this computation: (1) for structures with a
   simple stress field, an approximate closed-form expression for the
   strength distribution based on the Taylor series expansion of the
   grafted Weibull-Gaussian distribution; and (2) for structures with a
   complex stress field, a random RVE placing method based on the
   centroidal Voronoi tessellation. Numerical examples including
   three-point and four-point bend beams, and a two-dimensional analysis of
   the ill-fated Malpasset dam, show that Method 1 agrees well with Method
   2 as well as with the previously proposed nonlocal boundary method. DOI:

Abstract = {{Spandrel beams in precast concrete buildings are widely used to support
   double-tee deck beams, particularly in parking garages. Spandrel beams
   of deep cross-sections, resisting eccentric loads from double-tee beams,
   can be susceptible to excessive lateral deformations and serviceability
   failures before reaching their strength limits. However, closed-form
   solutions for estimating lateral deflections in such members are not
   available in the technical literature. In this paper, approximate
   analytical solutions for the deflection of beams with thin rectangular
   sections are derived from second-order elastic analysis, and they are
   proposed for use in estimating maximum lateral deflections in spandrel
   beams under eccentric and uniformly distributed loads. Continuous
   lateral support is provided at the elevation of the floor deck to the
   spandrel beams. Thus, two cases are considered: one for laterally
   restrained beams under typical service conditions, and a second for
   laterally unrestrained beams prior to the establishing the floor deck
   connections, or if those connections fail prematurely during service or
   under extreme loading. An equivalent loading method is proposed to
   obtain the approximate analytical solutions, in which the differential
   equations of equilibrium governing the problem are simplified by
   replacing the actual loading in the spandrel beams with a substitute
   loading. Numerical solutions are also obtained from three-dimensional
   finite element analyses and their results are found to be in close
   agreement with the analytical solutions for two of the three common
   types of load-bearing precast, prestressed concrete spandrel beams. DOI:

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL MECHANICS-THEORY AND EXPERIMENT}},
Year = {{2012}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Analysis of flow in fluidized beds, a common chemical reactor, is of
   much current interest due to its fundamental as well as industrial
   importance. Experimental data for the successive increments of the
   pressure fluctuations time series in a fluidized bed are analyzed by
   computing a multiscale probability density function (PDF) of the
   increments. The results demonstrate the evolution of the shape of the
   PDF from the short to long time scales. The deformation of the PDF
   across time scales may be modeled by the log-normal cascade model. The
   results are also in contrast to the previously proposed PDFs for the
   pressure fluctuations that include a Gaussian distribution and a PDF
   with a power-law tail. To understand better the properties of the
   pressure fluctuations, we also construct the shuffled and surrogate time
   series for the data and analyze them with the same method. It turns out
   that long-range correlations play an important role in the structure of
   the time series that represent the pressure fluctuation.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of turbulence on nanoparticle nucleation are studied using a
   combination of fully resolved and large-scale quantities from direct
   numerical simulations. Growth of these particles is considered by
   Brownian coagulation. Three simulations are performed using a single
   Reynolds number and vapor mass fraction. In addition to the direct
   numerical simulation, we perform hybrid simulations in which fluid,
   thermal, and scalar transport are fully resolved, while the
   thermo-chemical variables used in predicting nanoparticle nucleation are
   filtered. This allows us to elucidate the effects of the unresolved or
   sub-grid scale (SGS) scalars on the formation of metal particles. The
   results show that the saturation ratio-representative of the driving
   force towards particle nucleation-is over-predicted when the SGS
   interactions are neglected. This results in increased
   nucleation-particle formation occurs both further upstream and at
   greater rates. While the SGS interactions act to both increase and
   decrease particle formation, the tendency to decrease nucleation is
   dominant. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Gas to particle conversion in the form of nucleation within various flow
   systems plays a significant role in a variety of industrial and natural
   processes. Recently developed surface tension models offer increased
   accuracy in the modeling of metal particle nucleation. These models
   facilitate the probing of the effects of fluid, scalar, and thermal
   transport on nucleation in an accurate manner. In this work we
   investigate the formation of metal nanoparticles in laminar flows. The
   flows consist of metal vapor diluted in argon issuing into a cooler
   argon stream. The fluid, thermal, and chemical fields are obtained by
   solving the Navier Stokes, enthalpy, and mass-fraction transport
   equations while nucleation is simulated via a homogeneous nucleation
   model with size-dependent surface tension. This approach is attractive
   in that it promises to be more accurate than the classical nucleation
   theory (CNT) while maintaining much of its simplicity when coupling with
   fluid dynamics. The results show that the size-dependent surface tension
   nucleation model is more accurate than CNT and agrees well with physical
   data. Physically, the sensitivity of the saturation ratio to changes in
   temperature is shown to be greater than its sensitivity to mass
   fraction, highlighting the significance of differential molecular
   transport of energy and mass and the significance of non-unity Lewis
   numbers. More significantly, the size-dependent surface tension approach
   suggests that certain metals may have a maximum nucleation rate and
   further cooling-a strategy employed to increase particle nucleation
   rates-will actually decrease particle nucleation.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SERVICES COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{437-449}},
Month = {{JUL-SEP}},
Abstract = {{As the number of services and the size of data involved in workflows
   increases, centralized orchestration techniques are reaching the limits
   of scalability. When relying on web services without third-party data
   transfer, a standard orchestration model needs to pass all data through
   a centralized engine, which results in unnecessary data transfer and the
   engine to become a bottleneck to the execution of a workflow. As a
   solution, this paper presents and evaluates Circulate, an alternative
   service-oriented architecture which facilitates an orchestration model
   of central control in combination with a choreography model of optimized
   distributed data transport. Extensive performance analysis through the
   PlanetLab framework is conducted on a web service-based implementation
   over a range of Internet-scale configurations which mirror scientific
   workflow environments. Performance analysis concludes that our
   architecture's optimized model of data transport speeds up the execution
   time of workflows, consistently outperforms standard orchestration and
   scales with data and node size. Furthermore, Circulate is a
   less-intrusive solution as individual services do not have to be
   reconfigured in order to take part in a workflow.}},

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{In this study we present a procedure for the design and implementation
   of a control strategy to optimize energy use within a light weight
   hydraulic hybrid passenger vehicle. The hydraulic hybrid utilizes a high
   pressure accumulator for energy storage which has superior power density
   than conventional battery technology. This makes fluid power attractive
   for urban driving applications in which there are frequent starts and
   stops and large startup power demands. A dynamic model of a series
   hydraulic hybrid powertrain is presented along with the design of a
   model predictive control based energy management strategy. Model
   predictive control was chosen for this study because it uses no future
   information about the drive cycle in its design. This increases the
   flexibility of the controller allowing it to be directly applied to a
   variety of drive cycles. Using the model predictive framework, a
   holistic view of the powertrain was taken in the design of the control
   strategy, and the impact of each actuator's efficiency on overall
   efficiency was evaluated. A hardware-in-the-loop experiment using an
   electro-hydraulic powertrain testbed was then used to validate the
   dynamic model and control performance. Through a simulation study in
   which each actuator's efficiency was given varying levels of priority in
   the objective function, it was found that overall system efficiency
   could be improved by allowing for small sacrifices in individual
   component performance. In fact, the conventional wisdom of using the
   additional degrees of freedom within a hybrid powertrain to optimize
   engine efficiency was found to yield the lowest overall powertrain
   efficiency. In this work we present a rigorous framework for the design
   of an energy management strategy. The design method improves the
   powertrain's operational efficiency by finding the best balance between
   optimizing individual component efficiencies. Furthermore, since the
   design of the control strategy is built upon an analysis of individual
   components, it can be readily extended to other architectures employing
   different actuators. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006082]}},

Abstract = {{The genetic evolution from a benign neurofibroma to a malignant sarcoma
   in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) syndrome remains
   unclear. Schwann cells and/or their precursor cells are believed to be
   the primary pathogenic cell in neurofibromas because they harbor
   biallelic neurofibromin 1 (NF1) gene mutations. However, the phosphatase
   and tensin homolog (Pten) and neurofibromatosis 1 (Nf1) genes recently
   were found to be comutated in high-grade peripheral nerve sheath tumors
   (PNST) in mice. In this study, we created transgenic mice that lack both
   Pten and Nf1 in Schwann cells and Schwann cell precursor cells to
   validate the role of these two genes in PNST formation in vivo.
   Haploinsufficiency or complete loss of Pten dramatically accelerated
   neurofibroma development and led to the development of higher grade
   PNSTs in the context of Nf1 loss. Pten dosage, together with Nf1 loss,
   was sufficient for the progression from low-grade to high-grade PNSTs.
   Genetic analysis of human malignant PNSTs (MPNST) also revealed
   downregulation of PTEN expression, suggesting that Pten-regulated
   pathways are major tumor-suppressive barriers to neurofibroma
   progression. Together, our findings establish a novel mouse model that
   can rapidly recapitulate the onset of human neurofibroma tumorigenesis
   and the progression to MPNSTs. Cancer Res; 72(13); 3405-13. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The excitation of the steady-state precessions of magnetization opens a
   new way for nanoscale microwave oscillators by exploiting the transfer
   of spin angular momentum from a spin-polarized current to a ferromagnet,

   practical, however, their relatively low output power and their
   relatively large line width must be improved. Here we demonstrate that

   simultaneously narrow line width of 25 MHz can be generated from
   CoFeB-MgO-based magnetic tunnel junctions having an in-plane magnetized
   reference layer and a free layer with strong perpendicular anisotropy.
   Moreover, the generation efficiency is substantially higher than
   previously reported STNOs. The results will be of importance for the

Abstract = {{The implementation of a finite-rate catalytic-wall boundary condition
   easily incorporated into generic hypersonic flow solvers is described in
   detail. Simulations of hypersonic flow over a cylinder are presented
   using the finite-rate catalytic model parameterized with a test air
   silica chemical model comprising the gas surface reaction mechanisms and
   their associated rates. It is demonstrated that backward recombination
   rates should not be arbitrarily set but must be consistent with the
   gas-phase thermodynamics, otherwise a drift from the equilibrium state
   may occur. The heat flux predicted by the finite-rate model lies between
   noncatalytic and supercatalytic limits, depending on the surface
   temperature. It is found that, even for a constant surface temperature,
   the oxygen recombination efficiencies determined by the model are not
   only a function of temperature but also a function of the surface
   coverage, where recombination efficiencies are seen to rise as coverage
   decreases. Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis is performed to correlate
   the influence of individual mechanisms to the stagnation-point heat
   flux, and the expected progression of dominant mechanisms is found as
   the surface temperature is raised. Additionally, it is found that
   increased surface reactivity increases the chemical heat flux while also
   altering the boundary layer in a manner that decreases the conductive
   heat flux.}},

Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},

Abstract = {{The DNA deaminase APOBEC3G converts cytosines to uracils in retroviral
   cDNA, which are immortalized as genomic strand G-to-A hypermutations by
   reverse transcription. A single round of APOBEC3G-dependent mutagenesis
   can be catastrophic, but evidence suggests that sublethal levels
   contribute to viral genetic diversity and the associated problems of
   drug resistance and immune escape. APOBEC3G exhibits an intrinsic
   preference for the second cytosine in a 5'CC dinucleotide motif leading
   to 5'GG-to-AG mutations. However, an additional hypermutation signature
   is commonly observed in proviral sequences from HIV-1 infected patients,
   5'GA-to-AA, and it has been attributed controversially to one or more of
   the six other APOBEC3 deaminases. An unambiguous resolution of this
   problem has been difficult to achieve, in part due to dominant effects
   of protein over-expression. Here, we employ gene targeting to dissect
   the endogenous APOBEC3 contribution to Vif-deficient HIV-1 restriction
   and hypermutation in a nonpermissive T cell line CEM2n. We report that
   APOBEC3G-null cells, as predicted from previous studies, lose the
   capacity to inflict 5'GG-to-AG mutations. In contrast, APOBEC3F-null
   cells produced viruses with near-normal mutational patterns. Systematic
   knockdown of other APOBEC3 genes in an APOBEC3F-null background revealed
   a significant contribution from APOBEC3D in promoting 5'GA-to-AA
   hypermutations. Furthermore, Vif-deficient HIV-1 restriction was strong
   in parental CEM2n and APOBEC3D-knockdown cells, partially alleviated in
   APOBEC3G- or APOBEC3F-null cells, further alleviated in
   APOBEC3F-null/APOBEC3D-knockdown cells, and alleviated to the greatest
   extent in APOBEC3F-null/APOBEC3G-knockdown cells revealing clear
   redundancy in the HIV-1 restriction mechanism. We conclude that
   endogenous levels of APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, and APOBEC3G combine to
   restrict Vif-deficient HIV-1 and cause the hallmark dinucleotide
   hypermutation patterns in CEM2n. Primary T lymphocytes express a similar
   set of APOBEC3 genes suggesting that the same repertoire may be
   important in vivo.}},

Title = {{Structural Mechanism of Trimeric HIV-1 Envelope Glycoprotein Activation}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{HIV-1 infection begins with the binding of trimeric viral envelope
   glycoproteins (Env) to CD4 and a co-receptor on target T-cells.
   Understanding how these ligands influence the structure of Env is of
   fundamental interest for HIV vaccine development. Using cryo-electron
   microscopy, we describe the contrasting structural outcomes of trimeric
   Env binding to soluble CD4, to the broadly neutralizing, CD4-binding
   site antibodies VRC01, VRC03 and b12, or to the monoclonal antibody 17b,
   a co-receptor mimic. Binding of trimeric HIV-1 BaL Env to either soluble
   CD4 or 17b alone, is sufficient to trigger formation of the open
   quaternary conformation of Env. In contrast, VRC01 locks Env in the
   closed state, while b12 binding requires a partial opening in the
   quaternary structure of trimeric Env. Our results show that, despite
   general similarities in regions of the HIV-1 gp120 polypeptide that
   contact CD4, VRC01, VRC03 and b12, there are important differences in
   quaternary structures of the complexes these ligands form on native
   trimeric Env, and potentially explain differences in the neutralizing
   breadth and potency of antibodies with similar specificities. From
   cryo-electron microscopic analysis at similar to 9 angstrom resolution
   of a cleaved, soluble version of trimeric Env, we show that a structural
   signature of the open Env conformation is a three-helix motif composed
   of alpha-helical segments derived from highly conserved,
   non-glycosylated N-terminal regions of the gp41 trimer. The three
   N-terminal gp41 helices in this novel, activated Env conformation are
   held apart by their interactions with the rest of Env, and are less
   compactly packed than in the post-fusion, six-helix bundle state. These
   findings suggest a new structural template for designing immunogens that
   can elicit antibodies targeting HIV at a vulnerable, pre-entry stage.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc cadmium sulfide (ZnxCd1-xS) thin films grown through chemical bath
   deposition are used in chalcopyrite solar cells as the buffer layer
   between the n-type zinc oxide and the p-type light absorbing
   chalcopyrite film. To optimize energetic band alignment and optical
   absorption, advanced solar cell architectures require the ability to
   manipulate x as a function of distance from the absorber-ZnCdS
   interface. Herein, we investigate the fundamental factors that govern
   the evolution of the composition as a function of depth in the film. By
   changing the initial concentrations of Zn and Cd salts in the bath, the
   entire range of overall compositions ranging from primarily cubic ZnS to
   primarily hexagonal CdS could be deposited. However, films are
   inhomogeneous and x varies significantly as function of distance from
   the film-substrate interface. Films with high overall Zn concentration
   (x > 0.5) exhibit a Cd-rich layer near the film-substrate interface
   because Cd is more reactive than Zn. This layer is typically beneath a
   nearly pure ZnS film that, forms after the Cd-rich layers are deposited
   and Cd is depleted in the bath In films with high overall Cd
   concentration (x < 0.5), the Zn concentration rises towards the film's
   surface. Fortunately, these gradients are favorable for solar cells
   based on low band gap chalcopyrite films.}},

Abstract = {{Algorithms that jointly allocate resources across different layers are
   envisioned to boost the performance of wireless systems. Recent results
   have revealed that two of the most important parameters that critically
   affect the resulting cross-layer designs are channel- and queue-state
   information (QSI). Motivated by these results, this paper relies on
   stochastic convex optimization to develop optimal algorithms that use
   instantaneous fading and queue length information to allocate resources
   at the transport (flow-control), link, and physical layers. Focus is
   placed on a cellular system, where an access point exchanges information
   with different users over flat-fading orthogonal channels. Both uplink
   and downlink setups are considered. The allocation strategies are
   obtained as the solution of a constrained utility maximization problem
   that involves average performance metrics. It turns out that the optimal
   allocation at a given instant depends on the instantaneous channel-
   state information (CSI) and Lagrange multipliers, which are associated
   with the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements and the operating
   conditions of the system. The multipliers are estimated online using
   stochastic approximation tools and are linked with the window-averaged
   length of the queues. Capitalizing on those links, queue stability and
   average queuing delay of the developed algorithms are characterized, and
   a simple mechanism is devised to effect delay priorities among users.}},

Abstract = {{Transcription activator-like (TAL) effectors are repeat-containing
   proteins used by plant pathogenic bacteria to manipulate host gene
   expression. Repeats are polymorphic and individually specify single
   nucleotides in the DNA target, with some degeneracy. A TAL
   effector-nucleotide binding code that links repeat type to specified
   nucleotide enables prediction of genomic binding sites for TAL effectors
   and customization of TAL effectors for use in DNA targeting, in
   particular as custom transcription factors for engineered gene
   regulation and as site-specific nucleases for genome editing. We have
   developed a suite of web-based tools called TAL Effector-Nucleotide
   Targeter 2.0 (TALE-NT 2.0; https://boglab.plp.iastate.edu/) that enables
   design of custom TAL effector repeat arrays for desired targets and
   prediction of TAL effector binding sites, ranked by likelihood, in a
   genome, promoterome or other sequence of interest. Search parameters can
   be set by the user to work with any TAL effector or TAL effector
   nuclease architecture. Applications range from designing highly specific
   DNA targeting tools and identifying potential off-target sites to
   predicting effector targets important in plant disease.}},

   doi:10.1152/ajpheart.00017.2012.-Myocardial ischemia results in
   metabolic changes, which collapse the mitochondrial network, that
   increase the vulnerability of the heart to ventricular fibrillation
   (VF). It has been demonstrated at the single cell level that uncoupling
   the mitochondria using carbonyl cyanide
   p-(tri-fluoromethoxy)phenyl-hydrazone (FCCP) at low concentrations can
   be cardioprotective. The aim of our study was to investigate the effect
   of FCCP on arrhythmogenesis during ischemia in the whole rabbit heart.
   We performed optical mapping of isolated rabbit hearts (n = 33) during
   control and 20 min of global ischemia and reperfusion, both with and
   without pretreatment with the mitochondrial uncoupler FCCP at 100, 50,
   or 30 nM. No hearts went into VF during ischemia under the control
   condition, with or without the electromechanical uncoupler blebbistatin.
   We found that pretreatment with 100 (n = 4) and 50 (n = 6) nM FCCP, with
   or without blebbistatin, leads to VF during ischemia in all hearts,
   whereas pretreatment with 30 nM of FCCP led to three out of eight hearts
   going into VF during ischemia. We demonstrated that 30 nM of FCCP
   significantly increased interventricular (but not intraventricular)
   action potential duration and conduction velocity heterogeneity in the
   heart during ischemia, thus providing the substrate for VF. We showed
   that wavebreaks during VF occurred between the right and left
   ventricular junction. We also demonstrated that no VF occurred in the
   heart pretreated with 10 mu M glibenclamide, which is known to abolish
   interventricular heterogeneity. Our results indicate that low
   concentrations of FCCP, although cardioprotective at the single cell
   level, are arrhythmogenic at the whole heart level. This is due to the
   fact that FCCP induces different electrophysiological changes to the
   right and left ventricle, thus increasing interventricular heterogeneity
   and providing the substrate for VF.}},

Abstract = {{Because of the technology limitation and safety requirement, a large
   amount of air-mixed coal bed methane is released directly to the
   atmosphere. It leads to severe waste of resources and exacerbates the
   greenhouse effect. This work tries to alleviate this problem by
   separating CH4 from a mixture of CH4 and N-2 via hydrate separation
   method. Several experiments were systematically carried out in 6 mol \%
   tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution to separate CH4/N-2 gas mixtures
   containing 4.90 to 71.23 mol \% CH4. The results that THF can
   significantly reduce the formation pressure of CH4-N-2 hydrate
   materialize the possibility of separating CH4 and N-2 using hydrate
   separation technology in industrial scale. CH4 can be separated
   effectively from CH4/N-2 mixture and concentrated in hydrate phase with
   the presence of THF. The recovery of CH4 ranges from 34.06\% to 58.16\%
   and the separation factor is between 2.29 and 5.17. A two-stage
   separation process of 46.28 mol \% CH4/53.72 mol \% N-2 with recycle is
   designed to increase the recovery of CH4. The calculated results
   indicate that CH4 concentration in hydrate gas could reach 82.61 mol \%
   with a recovery yield of 47.28\%. Hydrate separation technology is an
   effective way to process and utilize the air-mixed coal bed methane.
   Multistage separation process does have wide application prospects.}},

Abstract = {{Primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) of the brain include
   medulloblastoma (MB) and central nervous system primitive
   neuroectodermal tumor (CNS PNET) subtypes, which share histological
   features yet differ at the genomic level and in clinical outcome.
   Delineation of the genetic anomalies between PNET subtypes is a current
   challenge for establishing effective targeted therapeutic strategies
   against these aggressive tumors. Current efforts have demonstrated that
   specific molecular pathways drive a subset of MB and CNS PNET, but the
   genetic basis for the deadliest forms of these tumors remains poorly
   understood and anecdotal. This is in part due to an overall lack of
   biologically relevant in vivo and in vitro model systems capable of
   direct comparison and identification of the genetic origins among PNET
   subtypes. Forward genetic, random muta genesis in mice is an effective
   phenotype-driven method to model the genetic origins of human disease
   including cancer. We have applied this method to PNET by developing a
   single Sleeping Beauty transposon insertional muta genesis mouse model
   that recapitulates the morphological similarities and genetic
   heterogeneity of MB and CNS PNET capable of identifying genetic drivers
   important for genesis of PNET. Importantly, this model has allowed new
   PNET phenotypes to be observed and is designed to reveal biologically
   relevant candidate oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes for MB and CNS
   PNET molecular subgroups in mice and humans. The ultimate goal of the
   approach we have taken is to uncover new understanding of the genetic
   basis for MB and CNS PNET development, how they are distinguished from
   each other, and offer potential targets for therapeutic testing to
   improve patient clinical outcome.}},

Abstract = {{The effect of geometry on the flow around a cylinder in crossflow is
   investigated in this study. Three different stepped-diameter circular
   cylinders (SDCC s) with varying step heights are used. Extensive flow
   visualization using the oil-lampblack and smoke-wire techniques and near
   wake velocity measurements using a hotwire anemometer reveal complex
   secondary flows on and around the SDCC. Six vortices are observed in the
   horseshoe vortex system near the cylinder endwall junction and six
   additional vortices are found in the step-induced vortex system on the
   step surface. Based on these experimental results, new secondary flow
   models are proposed. The step-induced vortices separate from the step
   surface at both sides and move toward the endwall, washing down the
   sides of the top/bottom larger diameter cylinders and interact with the
   separated shear layer and horseshoe vortices. In this process, they
   modify the near wake flow significantly: they produce an increase in
   velocity near the endwall region (below the step) and a decrease in
   velocity near the mid-span region, even altering the oscillatory
   behavior of the wake. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Johnson MD, Zhang J, Ghosh D, McIntyre CC, Vitek JL. Neural targets for
   relieving parkinsonian rigidity and bradykinesia with pallidal deep
   brain stimulation. J Neurophysiol 108: 567-577, 2012. First published
   April 18, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00039.2012.-Clinical evidence has
   suggested that subtle changes in deep brain stimulation (DBS) settings
   can have differential effects on bradykinesia and rigidity in patients
   with Parkinson's disease. In this study, we first investigated the
   degree of improvement in bradykinesia and rigidity during targeted
   globus pallidus DBS in three 1-methyl-4phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine
   (MPTP)-treated rhesus macaques. Behavioral outcomes of DBS were then
   coupled with detailed, subject-specific computational models of neurons
   in the globus pallidus internus (GPi), globus pallidus externus (GPe),
   and internal capsule (IC) to determine which neuronal pathways when
   modulated with high-frequency electrical stimulation best correlate with
   improvement in motor symptoms. The modeling results support the
   hypothesis that multiple neuronal pathways can underlie the therapeutic
   effect of DBS on parkinsonian bradykinesia and rigidity. Across all
   three subjects, improvements in rigidity correlated most strongly with
   spread of neuronal activation into IC, driving a small percentage of
   fibers within this tract (< 10\% on average). The most robust effect on
   bradykinesia resulted from stimulating a combination of sensorimotor
   axonal projections within the GP, specifically at the site of the medial
   medullary lamina. Thus the beneficial effects of pallidal DBS for
   parkinsonian symptoms may occur from multiple targets within and near
   the target nucleus.}},

Abstract = {{A wind tunnel experiment has been performed to quantify the Reynolds
   number dependence of turbulence statistics in the wake of a model wind
   turbine. A wind turbine was placed in a boundary layer flow developed
   over a smooth surface under thermally neutral conditions. Experiments
   considered Reynolds numbers on the basis of the turbine rotor diameter
   and the velocity at hub height, ranging from Re?=?1.66?x?104 to
   1.73?x?105. Results suggest that main flow statistics (mean velocity,
   turbulence intensity, kinematic shear stress and velocity skewness)
   become independent of Reynolds number starting from Re similar to
   9.3?x?104. In general, stronger Reynolds number dependence was observed
   in the near wake region where the flow is strongly affected by the
   aerodynamics of the wind turbine blades. In contrast, in the far wake
   region, where the boundary layer flow starts to modulate the dynamics of
   the wake, main statistics showed weak Reynolds dependence. These results
   will allow us to extrapolate wind tunnel and computational fluid dynamic
   simulations, which often are conducted at lower Reynolds numbers, to
   full-scale conditions. In particular, these findings motivates us to
   improve existing parameterizations for wind turbine wakes (e.g. velocity
   deficit, wake expansion, turbulence intensity) under neutral conditions
   and the predictive capabilities of atmospheric large eddy simulation
   models. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Junction temperature is an important issue for a semiconductor package,
   influencing the package's thermal, mechanical, and reliability
   performance. An accurate prediction of junction temperature provides
   informative guidance in design, development and operation of the
   package. A compact thermal resistor-capacitor (RC) network approach is
   presented in this paper to accurately predict transient junction
   temperatures. The thermal RC network in this approach is a nongrounded
   Foster network. This approach consists of extraction of the thermal
   Foster network and prediction of the transient junction temperature
   response to a given power input using the extracted network. The network
   extraction part is based on Kirchhoff's current law and Laplace
   transformation technique, and uses the Foster network to facilitate
   changes of the RC network structure. The temperature prediction part is
   a direct substitution-and-calculation process, and therefore is fast to
   carry out. Since Laplace transforms are directly or indirectly available
   for most power inputs, their transient temperatures may be predicted by
   the proposed approach. Superposition is employed in cases where the
   Laplace transform of a given power input is not directly found in
   Laplace tables, or where the junction temperature is affected by
   multiple heat sources. The proposed approach is demonstrated with a
   power amplifier (PA) module; predicted junction temperatures are
   accurate in both single and multiple heat source cases.}},

Abstract = {{To empower older consumers and improve health outcomes, a
   consumer-friendly personal health record (PHR) is needed. The purpose of
   this article was to evaluate PHR technology and content for older
   community-dwelling consumers. Specific aims were to: (a) develop a
   secure, web-based application for a PHR to enable interoperable
   exchanges of data between consumers and clinicians; (b) develop
   structured, evidence-based shared care plan content for the PHR using an
   interface terminology standard; and (c) validate the shared care plans
   with consumers. An interoperable web-based form was developed. The
   standardized PHR content was developed by expert panel consensus using
   the Omaha System problem list and care plans, and validated by consumer
   interviews. Evidence-based shared care plans for 21 problems common
   among community-dwelling older adults were developed and encoded with
   Omaha System terms for data capture in the PHR. An additional problem,
   Neighborhood-workplace safety, was identified by consumers and will be
   added to the care plans.}},

   time-series several notions of distance (divergences) have been proposed

   only recently began to receive any attention. In the paper, two classes
   of divergence measures inspired by classical prediction theory are
   introduced. These divergences naturally induce Riemannian metrics on the
   cone of multivariable densities. The metrics amount to the quadratic
   term in the divergence between ``infinitesimally close to each other{''}
   power spectra. For one of the two we provide explicit formulae for the
   corresponding geodesics and geodesic distance. A close connection
   between the geometry of power spectra and the geometry of the Fisher-Rao
   metric is noted.}},

Abstract = {{Determining interrelatedness structure of various entities from multiple
   time series data is of significant interest to many areas. Knowledge of
   such a structure can aid in identifying cause and effect relationships,
   clustering of similar entities, identification of representative
   elements and model reduction. The majority of existing results are based
   on correlation based indices which effectively assume a static
   relationship between the time series data and are not suitable for
   detecting interrelatedness when the time series are dynamically related
   or when the time series involve loops. In this paper, a methodology for
   identifying the interrelatedness structure of dynamically related time
   series data is presented that also allows for the presence of loops in
   the connectivity structure. A linear dynamic graph model is presented
   where it is assumed that each time series data is the sum of an
   independent stochastic noise source and a dynamically weighted sum of
   other time series data. A link is assumed to be present between two time
   series if the weight of a time series, which is a linear time-invariant
   filter, is nonzero in the formation of the other. Reconstruction of the
   link connectivity structure under various scenarios is considered. It is
   shown that when the linear dynamic graph is allowed to admit non-causal
   weights, then the links structure can be recovered with the possibility
   of identifying spurious connections. However, it is shown that the
   spurious links remain local, where, a spurious link is restricted to be
   within one hop of a true link. Furthermore, strategies for exact
   reconstruction of the link structure when the weights are restricted to
   be causal are developed. The main tools for determining the network
   topology are based on variations of Wiener filtering. A significant
   insight provided by the article is that, in the class of network models
   considered in the paper, the Wiener filter estimating a stochastic
   process based on other processes remains local in the sense that the
   Wiener filter utilizes only measurements local to the node being
   estimated.}},

Abstract = {{Catheters are routinely inserted via vessels to cavities of the heart
   during fluoroscopic image guided interventions for electrophysiology
   (EP) procedures such as ablation. During such interventions, the
   catheter undergoes nonrigid deformation due to physician interaction,
   patient's breathing, and cardiac motions. EP clinical applications can
   benefit from fast and accurate automatic catheter tracking in the
   fluoroscopic images. The typical low quality in fluoroscopic images and
   the presence of other medical instruments in the scene make the
   automatic detection and tracking of catheters in clinical environments
   very challenging. Toward the development of such an application, a
   robust and efficient method for detecting and tracking the catheter
   sheath is developed. The proposed approach exploits the clinical setup
   knowledge to constrain the search space while boosting both tracking
   speed and accuracy, and is based on a computationally efficient
   framework to trace the sheath and simultaneously detect one or multiple
   catheter tips. The algorithm is based on a modification of the fast
   marching weighted distance computation that efficiently calculates, on
   the fly, important geodesic properties in relevant regions of the image.
   This is followed by a cascade classifier for detecting the catheter
   tips. The proposed technique is validated on 1107 fluoroscopic images
   acquired on multiple patients across four different clinics, achieving
   multiple catheter tracking at a rate of 10 images/s with a very low
   false positive rate of 1.06.}},

Title = {{Physical descriptions of the bacterial nucleoid at large scales, and
   their biological implications}},
Journal = {{REPORTS ON PROGRESS IN PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{75}},
Number = {{7}},
Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Recent experimental and theoretical approaches have attempted to
   quantify the physical organization (compaction and geometry) of the
   bacterial chromosome with its complement of proteins (the nucleoid). The
   genomic DNA exists in a complex and dynamic protein-rich state, which is
   highly organized at various length scales. This has implications for
   modulating (when not directly enabling) the core biological processes of
   replication, transcription and segregation. We overview the progress in
   this area, driven in the last few years by new scientific ideas and new
   interdisciplinary experimental techniques, ranging from high space-and
   time-resolution microscopy to high-throughput genomics employing
   sequencing to map different aspects of the nucleoid-related interactome.
   The aim of this review is to present the wide spectrum of experimental
   and theoretical findings coherently, from a physics viewpoint. In
   particular, we highlight the role that statistical and soft condensed
   matter physics play in describing this system of fundamental biological
   importance, specifically reviewing classic and more modern tools from
   the theory of polymers. We also discuss some attempts toward unifying
   interpretations of the current results, pointing to possible directions
   for future investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Brown rot fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum and Postia placenta were used to
   degrade aspen, spruce, or corn stover over 16 weeks. Decayed residues
   were saccharified using commercial cellulases or brown rot fungal
   extracts, loaded at equal but low endoglucanase titers. Saccharification
   was then repeated for high-yield samples using full strength commercial
   cellulases. Overall, brown rot pretreatments enhanced yields up to
   threefold when using either cellulase preparation. In the best case,
   aspen degraded 2 weeks by G. trabeum yielded 72\%
   glucose-from-cellulose, a 51\% yield relative to original glucan. A
   follow-up trial with more frequent harvests showed similar patterns and
   demonstrated interplay between tissue modifications and
   saccharification. Hemicellulose and vanillic acid (G6) or vanillin (G4)
   lignin residues were good predictors of saccharification potential, the
   latter notable given lignin's potential active role in brown rot.
   Results show basic relationships over a brown rot time course and lend
   targets for controlling an applied bioconversion process. (C) 2012

Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{The recursive least-squares (RLS) algorithm has well-documented merits
   for reducing complexity and storage requirements, when it comes to
   online estimation of stationary signals as well as for tracking
   slowly-varying nonstationary processes. In this paper, a distributed
   recursive least-squares (D-RLS) algorithm is developed for cooperative
   estimation using ad hoc wireless sensor networks. Distributed iterations
   are obtained by minimizing a separable reformulation of the
   exponentially-weighted least-squares cost, using the
   alternating-minimization algorithm. Sensors carry out reduced-complexity
   tasks locally, and exchange messages with one-hop neighbors to consent
   on the network-wide estimates adaptively. A steady-state mean-square
   error (MSE) performance analysis of D-RLS is conducted, by studying a
   stochastically-driven `averaged' system that approximates the D-RLS
   dynamics asymptotically in time. For sensor observations that are
   linearly related to the time-invariant parameter vector sought, the
   simplifying independence setting assumptions facilitate deriving
   accurate closed-form expressions for the MSE steady-state values. The
   problems of mean-and MSE-sense stability of D-RLS are also investigated,
   and easily-checkable sufficient conditions are derived under which a
   steady-state is attained. Without resorting to diminishing step-sizes
   which compromise the tracking ability of D-RLS, stability ensures that
   per sensor estimates hover inside a ball of finite radius centered at
   the true parameter vector, with high-probability, even when inter-sensor
   communication links are noisy. Interestingly, computer simulations
   demonstrate that the theoretical findings are accurate also in the
   pragmatic settings whereby sensors acquire temporally-correlated data.}},

   It is only true for a non-cracked specimen. As the crack propagates, the

Title = {{A Numerical Investigation of Blood Damage in the Hinge Area of Aortic
   Bileaflet Mechanical Heart Valves During the Leakage Phase}},
Journal = {{ANNALS OF BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{7}},

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Previous experimental and numerical blood studies have shown that high
   shear stress levels, long exposure times to these shear stresses, and
   flow recirculation promote thromboembolism. Artificial heart valves, in
   particular bileaflet mechanical heart valves (BMHVs), are prone to
   developing thromboembolic complications. These complications often form
   at the hinge regions of BMHVs and the associated geometry has been shown
   to affect the local flow dynamics and the associated thrombus formation.
   However, to date no study has focused on simulating the motion of
   realistically modeled blood elements within the hinge region to
   numerically estimate the hinge-related blood damage. Consequently, this
   study aims at (a) simulating the motion of realistically modeled
   platelets during the leakage (mid-diastole) phase in different BMHV
   hinge designs placed in the aortic position and (b) quantitatively
   comparing the blood damage associated with different designs. Three
   designs are investigated to assess the effects of hinge geometry and
   dimensions: a 23 mm St. Jude Medical Regent (TM) valve hinge with two
   different gap distances between the leaflet ear and hinge recess; and a
   23 mm CarboMedics (CM) aortic valve hinge. The recently developed
   lattice-Boltzmann method with external boundary force method is used to
   simulate the hinge flow and capture the dynamics and surface shear
   stresses of individual platelets. A blood damage index (BDI) value is
   then estimated based on a linear shear stress-exposure time BDI model.
   The velocity boundary conditions are obtained from previous 3D
   large-scale simulations of the hinge flow fields. The trajectories of
   the blood elements in the hinge region are found to be qualitatively
   similar for all three hinges, but the shear stresses experienced by
   individual platelets are higher for the CM hinge design, leading to a
   higher BDI. The results of this study are also shown to be in good
   agreement with previous studies, thus validating the numerical method
   for future research in BMHV flows. This study provides a general
   numerical tool to optimize the hinge design based on both hemodynamic
   and thromboembolic performance.}},

Abstract = {{A collaborative convex framework for factoring a data matrix X into a
   nonnegative product AS, with a sparse coefficient matrix S, is proposed.
   We restrict the columns of the dictionary matrix A to coincide with
   certain columns of the data matrix X, thereby guaranteeing a physically
   meaningful dictionary and dimensionality reduction. We use l(1,infinity)
   regularization to select the dictionary from the data and show that this
   leads to an exact convex relaxation of l(0) in the case of distinct
   noise- free data. We also show how to relax the restriction-to-X
   constraint by initializing an alternating minimization approach with the
   solution of the convex model, obtaining a dictionary close to but not
   necessarily in X. We focus on applications of the proposed framework to
   hyperspectral endmember and abundance identification and also show an
   application to blind source separation of nuclear magnetic resonance
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Two novel methods for the measurement of the thermal conductivity of
   solids are described. One of the methods serves for high-conductivity
   media (all metals), while the second is appropriate for media of low
   conductivity (as low as that of air). Both of these methods are
   distinguished by the unique simplicity of their constituents, the low
   cost of the measurement apparatus, the easy-to-use operational protocol,
   and the inherent control of the level of accuracy. The method used for
   the measurement of high conductivity values is based on a quasi-steady
   model. Its experimental implementation demonstrated excellent agreement
   with literature values and indicated that insulation was not necessary
   to achieve high accuracy. In an enhanced form, it could be applied over
   a very wide range of temperatures. For low-conductivity media, in
   contrast to common practice, the experimental approach did not involve
   guard heating. Synergistic numerical simulation provided the conditions
   for optimal use of the measurement device. In particular, the accuracy
   of the measured conductivity values could be predicted without
   approximation, and guidance was provided for an experimental protocol
   according to which any desired accuracy could be obtained. Numerical
   simulation was also used to support the measurement technique for
   high-thermal-conductivity media. The synergistic use of experimentation
   and numerical simulation enabled highly accurate values for thermal
   conductivity to be obtained in the most simple, least costly, and
   easy-to-use device. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Analytical solution of dispersion in rapidly oscillating flows becomes
   infeasible in complex geometries. Simulation over long durations can be
   prohibitively expensive when there is a wide separation between the
   oscillation and dispersion time scales. Here, we present a methodology
   based on an implicit envelope-tracking scheme coupled with telescopic
   projections. A test problem, with a known analytical solution, was
   simulated, and the effect of Peclet number on the dispersivities was
   investigated. The solution was unaffected by the time steps for
   telescopic projections while increasing Peclet numbers introduced
   errors. The error was found to decrease with mesh refinement, but a
   small inherent error was observed. The method was also applied to a
   practical problem of interest to us: drug dispersion due to sloshing in
   the vitreous humor of the eye. Relative to single-scale solution, the
   method, when applied to the vitreous sloshing problem, produced speedup
   values of up to 100. (C) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Month = {{JUL}},
Abstract = {{Heat transfer coefficients and bubble motion characteristics are
   reported for two-phase water flow in an array of 13 equally spaced
   microchannels over an area of 1 cm(2). Each channel has D-h = 451 +/- 38
   mu m, W/H = 0.8, and L/D-h = 22.2. Uniform heat flux is applied through
   the base, and wall temperatures are determined from the thermocouple
   readings corrected for heat conduction effects. The upper surface is
   insulated and transparent. Single-phase heat transfer coefficients are
   in a good agreement with comparable trends of existing correlations for
   developing flow and heat transfer, although a difference is seen due to
   the insulated upper surface. Two-phase heat transfer coefficients and
   flow characteristics are determined for 221 < G < 466 kg/m(2) s and 250
   < q < 1780 kW/m(2). Heat transfer coefficients normalized with mass flux
   exhibit a trend comparable to that of available studies that use similar
   thermal boundary conditions. Flow visualization shows expanding vapor
   slug flow as the primary flow regime with nucleation and bubbly flow as
   the precursors. Analysis of bubble dynamics reveals similar to t(1/3)
   dependence for bubble growth. Flow reversal is observed and quantified,
   and different speeds of the vapor phase fronts are quantified at the
   leading and trailing edges of vapor slugs once the bubble diameter
   equals the channel width. Bubble formation, growth, coalescence, and
   detachment at the outlet of the array are best characterized by the
   Weber number. {[}DOI: 10.1115/1.4006097]}},

Abstract = {{To be fully exploitable in both formulation and manufacturing, a drug
   cocrystal needs to demonstrate simultaneous improvement of multiple key
   pharmaceutical properties over the pure drug crystal. The present work
   was aimed at investigating such feasibility with two model
   profen-nicotinamide cocrystals.
   Phase pure 1:1 ibuprofen-nicotinamide and flurbiprofen-nicotinamide
   cocrystals were prepared from solutions through rapid solvent removal
   using rotary evaporation,and characterized by DSC, PXRD, FTIR, phase
   solubility measurements, equilibrium moisture sorption analysis,
   dissolution testing and tabletability analysis.
   Temperature-composition phase diagrams constructed from DSC data for
   each profen and nicotinamide crystal revealed the characteristic melting
   point of the 1:1 cocrystal as well as the eutectic temperatures and
   compositions. Both cocrystals exhibited higher intrinsic dissolution
   rates than the corresponding profens. The cocrystals also sorbed less
   moisture and displayed considerably better tabletability than the
   individual profens and nicotinamide.
   Phase behaviors of 1:1 profen-nicotinamide cocrystal systems were
   delineated by constructing their temperature-composition phase diagrams.
   Cocrystallization with nicotinamide can simultaneously improve tableting
   behavior, hygroscopicity, and dissolution performance of ibuprofen and
   flurbiprofen. This could pave the way for further development of such
   cocrystal systems into consistent, stable, efficacious and readily
   manufacturable drug products.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To investigate the usage of a high-density EEG recording
   system and source imaging technique for localizing seizure activity in
   patients with medically intractable partial epilepsy.
   Methods: High-density, 76-channel scalp EEG signals were recorded in 10
   patients with partial epilepsy. The patients underwent routine clinical
   pre-surgical evaluation and all had resective surgery with seizure free
   outcome. After applying a FINE (first principle vectors) spatio-temporal
   source localization and DTF (directed transfer function) connectivity
   analysis approach, ictal sources were imaged. Effects of number of scalp
   EEG electrodes on the seizure localization were also assessed using 76,
   64, 48, 32, and 21 electrodes, respectively.
   Results: Surgical resections were used to assess the source imaging
   results. Results from the 76-channel EEG in the 10 patients showed high
   correlation with the surgically resected brain regions. The localization
   of seizure onset zone from 76-channel EEG showed improved source
   detection accuracy compared to other EEG configurations with fewer
   electrodes.
   Conclusions: FINE together with DTF was able to localize seizure onset
   zones of partial epilepsy patients. High-density EEG recording can help
   achieve improved seizure source imaging.
   Significance: The present results suggest the promise of high-density
   EEG and electrical source imaging for noninvasively localizing seizure
   onset zones. (C) 2011 International Federation of Clinical

Abstract = {{We have shown previously that it is possible to accurately reconstruct
   periodic motions in 3D from a single camera view, using periodicity as a
   physical constraint from which to perform geometric inference. In this
   paper we explore the suitability of the reconstruction techniques for
   real human motion. We examine the degree of periodicity of human gait
   empirically, and develop algorithmic tools to address some of the
   challenges arising from this type of motion, including reconstructing
   motions that deviate from pure periodicity, properly handling the
   trajectories of multiple points on an articulated body, and proposing a
   distance function for measuring the difference between two
   reconstructions. Importantly, we illustrate the usefulness of these
   techniques by applying them to the tasks of view-invariant activity
   classification, clinical gait analysis and person identification. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a method for identifying a set of dense subgraphs of
   a given sparse graph. Within the main applications of this ``dense
   subgraph problem,{''} the dense subgraphs are interpreted as
   communities, as in, e.g., social networks. The problem of identifying
   dense subgraphs helps analyze graph structures and complex networks and
   it is known to be challenging. It bears some similarities with the
   problem of reordering/blocking matrices in sparse matrix techniques. We
   exploit this link and adapt the idea of recognizing matrix column
   similarities, in order to compute a partial clustering of the vertices
   in a graph, where each cluster represents a dense subgraph. In contrast
   to existing subgraph extraction techniques which are based on a complete
   clustering of the graph nodes, the proposed algorithm takes into account
   the fact that not every participating node in the network needs to
   belong to a community. Another advantage is that the method does not
   require to specify the number of clusters; this number is usually not
   known in advance and is difficult to estimate. The computational process
   is very efficient, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is
   demonstrated in a few real-life examples.}},

Abstract = {{Hierarchical zeolites are a class of microporous catalysts and
   adsorbents that also contain mesopores, which allow for fast transport
   of bulky molecules and thereby enable improved performance in
   petrochemical and biomass processing. We used repetitive branching
   during one-step hydrothermal crystal growth to synthesize a new
   hierarchical zeolite made of orthogonally connected microporous
   nanosheets. The nanosheets are 2 nanometers thick and contain a network
   of 0.5-nanometer micropores. The house-of-cards arrangement of the
   nanosheets creates a permanent network of 2- to 7-nanometer mesopores,
   which, along with the high external surface area and reduced micropore
   diffusion length, account for higher reaction rates for bulky molecules
   relative to those of other mesoporous and conventional MFI zeolites.}},

Title = {{Three-dimensional brain reconstruction of in vivo electrode tracks for
   neuroscience and neural prosthetic applications}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 27}},
Abstract = {{The brain is a densely interconnected network that relies on populations
   of neurons within and across multiple nuclei to code for features
   leading to perception and action. However, the neurophysiology field is
   still dominated by the characterization of individual neurons, rather
   than simultaneous recordings across multiple regions, without consistent
   spatial reconstruction of their locations for comparisons across
   studies. There are sophisticated histological and imaging techniques for
   performing brain reconstructions. However, what is needed is a method
   that is relatively easy and inexpensive to implement in a typical
   neurophysiology lab and provides consistent identification of electrode
   locations to make it widely used for pooling data across studies and
   research groups. This paper presents our initial development of such an
   approach for reconstructing electrode tracks and site locations within
   the guinea pig inferior colliculus (IC) to identify its functional
   organization for frequency coding relevant for a new auditory midbrain
   implant (AMI). Encouragingly, the spatial error associated with
   different individuals reconstructing electrode tracks for the same
   midbrain was less than 65 mu m, corresponding to an error of similar to
   1.5\% relative to the entire IC structure (similar to 4-5 mm diameter
   sphere). Furthermore, the reconstructed frequency laminae of the IC were
   consistently aligned across three sampled midbrains, demonstrating the
   ability to use our method to combine location data across animals.
   Hopefully, through further improvements in our reconstruction method, it
   can be used as a standard protocol across neurophysiology labs to
   characterize neural data not only within the IC but also within other
   brain regions to help bridge the gap between cellular activity and
   network function. Clinically, correlating function with location within
   and across multiple brain regions can guide optimal placement of
   electrodes for the growing field of neural prosthetics.}},

   involving micellization at room temperature and gelation at elevated

   for clarity and thus providing guidance to the field by this special
   Review article, The 2012 Plasma Roadmap.
   Although roadmaps are common in the microelectronic industry and other
   fields of research and development, constructing a roadmap for the field
   of low-temperature plasmas is perhaps a unique undertaking. Realizing
   the difficulty of this task for any individual, the plasma section of
   the Journal of Physics D Board decided to meet the challenge of
   developing a roadmap through an unusual and novel concept. The roadmap
   was divided into 16 formalized short subsections each addressing a
   particular key topic. For each topic a renowned expert in the sub-field
   was invited to express his/her individual visions on the status, current
   and future challenges, and to identify advances in science and
   technology required to meet these challenges.
   Together these contributions form a detailed snapshot of the current
   state of the art which clearly shows the lifelines of the field and the
   challenges ahead. Novel technologies, fresh ideas and concepts, and new
   applications discussed by our authors demonstrate that the road to the
   future is wide and far reaching. We hope that this special plasma
   science and technology roadmap will provide guidance for colleagues,
   funding agencies and government institutions. If successful in doing so,
   the roadmap will be periodically updated to continue to help in guiding
   the field.}},

   delta-doped SrTiO3 layer that consisted of a 3-nm thickness of La-doped
   SrTiO3 with 6\% La embedded in a SrTiO3 film. Results are compared to a
   thick, uniformily doped La:SrTiO3 layer. We find no indication of a band
   offset for the delta-doped layer, but evidence of the presence of Ti3+
   in both the thick sample and the delta-layer, and indications of a
   density of states increase near the Fermi energy in the delta-doped
   layer. These results further demonstrate that HAXPES is a powerful tool
   for the non-destructive investigation of deeply buried doped layers. (C)

Abstract = {{The finite-element (FE) method is used for modeling geotechnical and
   pavement structures exhibiting significant non-homogeneity. Property
   gradients generated due to non-homogeneous distributions of moisture is
   one such example for geotechnical materials. Aging and
   temperature-induced property gradients are common sources of
   non-homogeneity for asphalt pavements. Investigation of time-dependent
   behavior combined with functionally graded property gradation can be
   accomplished by means of the non-homogeneous viscoelastic analysis
   procedure. This paper describes the development of a generalized
   isoparametric FE formulation to capture property gradients within
   elements, and a recursive formulation for solution of hereditary
   integral equations. The formulation is verified by comparison with
   analytical and numerical solutions. Two application examples are
   presented: the first describes stationary crack-tip fields for
   viscoelastic functionally graded materials, and the second example
   demonstrates the application of the proposed procedures for efficient
   and accurate simulations of interfaces between layers of flexible
   pavement. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Members of the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic
   polypeptide-like) protein family catalyze DNA cytosine deamination and
   underpin a variety of immune defenses. For instance, several family
   members, including APOBEC3B (A3B), elicit strong retrotransposon and
   retrovirus restriction activities. However, unlike the other proteins,
   A3B is the only family member with steady-state nuclear localization.
   Here, we show that A3B nuclear import is an active process requiring at
   least one amino acid (Val54) within an N-terminal motif analogous to the
   nuclear localization determinant of the antibody gene diversification
   enzyme AID (activation-induced cytosine deaminase). Mechanistic
   conservation with AID is further suggested by A3B's capacity to interact
   with the same subset of importin proteins. Despite these mechanistic
   similarities, enforced A3B expression cannot substitute for
   AID-dependent antibody gene diversification by class switch
   recombination. Regulatory differences between A3B and AID are also
   visible during cell cycle progression. Our studies suggest that the
   present-day A3B enzyme retained the nuclear import mechanism of an
   ancestral AID protein during the expansion of the APOBEC3 locus in
   primates. Our studies also highlight the likelihood that, after nuclear
   import, specialized mechanisms exist to guide these enzymes to their
   respective physiological substrates and prevent gratuitous chromosomal
   DNA damage. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Recent evidence suggests that TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand
   (TRAIL), a death-inducing cytokine with anti-tumor potential, initiates
   apoptosis by re-organizing TRAIL receptors into large clusters, although
   the structure of these clusters and the mechanism by which they assemble
   are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that TRAIL receptor 2 (DR5) forms
   receptor dimers in a ligand-dependent manner at endogenous receptor
   levels, and these receptor dimers exist within high molecular weight
   networks. Using mutational analysis, FRET, fluorescence microscopy,
   synthetic biochemistry, and molecular modeling, we find that receptor
   dimerization relies upon covalent and noncovalent interactions between
   membrane-proximal residues. Additionally, by using FRET, we show that
   the oligomeric structure of two functional isoforms of DR5 is
   indistinguishable. The resulting model of DR5 activation should revise
   the accepted architecture of the functioning units of DR5 and the
   structurally homologous TNF receptor superfamily members.}},

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory, we calculated the electronic structure,
   the lattice dynamics, and the Raman spectra of Cu2ZnSn(S1-xSex)(4),
   (CZTSSe) an emerging photovoltaic material for thinfilm solar cells. In
   particular, we investigated the effects of the local arrangement of S
   and Se within the unit cell on the electronic properties of these
   materials. We find that the S-to-Se ratio (e. g., x) and the spatial
   distribution of the anions in the unit cell can significantly alter the
   band structure. In particular, the S-to-Se ratio and anion distribution
   determine the energy splitting between the electronic states at the top
   of the valence band and the hole mobility in CZTSSe alloys and solar
   cells. Moreover, we find that x-ray diffraction patterns and phonon
   dispersion curves are sensitive to the local anion ordering. The
   predicted Raman scattering frequencies and their variation with x agree
   with experimentally determined values and trends. (C) 2012 American

Abstract = {{The effects of block copolymer molecular weight (MW) and composition on
   the critical micelle concentration (CMC) were studied using ionic
   liquids (ILs) as model solvents. Pyrene fluorescence was used to measure
   CMCs as a function of block MW for three polystyrene-poly(ethylene
   oxide) (PS-PEO) samples and three PS-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PS-PMMA)
   samples in 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide. The CMC decreased by a modest factor
   of 1.5 in the PS-PEO series, in which the solvophobic PS block MW
   remained unchanged (20 000) while the PEO block MW was decreased from 13
   000 to 5000. This result correlated reasonably well with calculations
   from self-consistent-field (SCF) theory. A greater decrease (factor of
   5) was seen in the PS-PMMA series, where the solvophobic PS block MW was
   varied from 3000 to 11 000 while maintaining a constant overall MW (ca.
   15 000). However, this decrease was much weaker than that predicted by
   SCF calculations. A compilation of literature CMC data for amphiphilic
   block copolymers in water generally reveals a strong dependence on
   solvophobic block degree of polymerization N for low N, but a much
   weaker dependence for longer solvophobic blocks. From master plots of
   the compiled data, a scaling parameter shift from CMC similar to
   exp(-cN) to CMC similar to exp(-cN(1/3)) was found above a critical
   solvophobic block N. The parameter c correlates with the x parameter
   between the solvophobic block and the solvent. The weaker N dependence
   was found to fit the IL data very well. While such a change in MW
   dependence has previously been attributed to the collapse of unimer
   solvophobic blocks, we also discuss the potential role of kinetic
   limitations.}},

Title = {{Stochastic simulations of a synthetic bacteria-yeast ecosystem}},
Journal = {{BMC SYSTEMS BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The field of synthetic biology has greatly evolved and
   numerous functions can now be implemented by artificially engineered
   cells carrying the appropriate genetic information. However, in order
   for the cells to robustly perform complex or multiple tasks,
   co-operation between them may be necessary. Therefore, various synthetic
   biological systems whose functionality requires cell-cell communication
   are being designed. These systems, microbial consortia, are composed of
   engineered cells and exhibit a wide range of behaviors. These include
   yeast cells whose growth is dependent on one another, or bacteria that
   kill or rescue each other, synchronize, behave as predator-prey
   ecosystems or invade cancer cells.
   Results: In this paper, we study a synthetic ecosystem comprising of
   bacteria and yeast that communicate with and benefit from each other
   using small diffusible molecules. We explore the behavior of this
   heterogeneous microbial consortium, composed of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
   and Escherichia coli cells, using stochastic modeling. The stochastic
   model captures the relevant intra-cellular and inter-cellular
   interactions taking place in and between the eukaryotic and prokaryotic
   cells. Integration of well-characterized molecular regulatory elements
   into these two microbes allows for communication through quorum sensing.
   A gene controlling growth in yeast is induced by bacteria via chemical
   signals and vice versa. Interesting dynamics that are common in natural
   ecosystems, such as obligatory and facultative mutualism, extinction,
   commensalism and predator-prey like dynamics are observed. We
   investigate and report on the conditions under which the two species can
   successfully communicate and rescue each other.
   Conclusions: This study explores the various behaviors exhibited by the
   cohabitation of engineered yeast and bacterial cells. The way that the
   model is built allows for studying the dynamics of any system consisting
   of two species communicating with one another via chemical signals.
   Therefore, key information acquired by our model may potentially drive
   the experimental design of various synthetic heterogeneous ecosystems.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{108}},
Number = {{23}},
Month = {{JUN 6}},
Abstract = {{Computer simulations are used to study composition fluctuations in

   Specifically, we test the random-phase approximation (RPA), which is
   based on a self-consistent field treatment of fluctuations, the
   Fredrickson-Helfand theory, which was designed to describe fluctuations
   near the order-disorder transition, and the relatively new renormalized
   one-loop (ROL) theory. The results confirm claims that the RPA is exact
   in the limit N -> infinity and that the ROL theory yields the dominant
   corrections to the RPA within a systematic expansion in powers of N-1/2,

Abstract = {{Gravimetric analysis is the regulatory method for diesel particulate
   mass measurement. Because of issues such as adsorption/volatilization
   artifacts, it faces obstacles in measuring ultra low level emissions
   from modern diesel engines. Alternative methods of suspended particle
   mass measurement have been developed that show improvements in time
   resolution, sensitivity, and accuracy. Three size-resolved methods were
   considered here. Two methods rely on converting number size
   distributions obtained using a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS).
   Conversion techniques were based on effective density measurements and
   the Lall-Friedlander aggregate model. The third method employs the
   Universal Nanoparticle Analyzer (UNPA) to measure the aggregate size
   distribution from which mass is calculated. Results were compared with
   mass concentrations obtained using gravimetric analysis. The effective
   density conversion resulted in mass concentrations that were highly
   correlated (R-2 >0.99) with filter mass. The ratios to filter mass
   concentration were found to be 0.99 +/- 0.04, 0.45 +/- 0.03, and 0.45
   +/- 0.19 for the effective density conversion, the Lall-Friedlander
   conversion, and the UNPA, respectively, for a wide range of engine
   operating conditions. In addition, the diesel aerosol mass distributions
   measured by the online techniques are in agreement to within 15-20\%
   with respect to the mass median diameter, while discrepancies were
   observed in the mass concentration.}},

   Reynolds-averaged turbulence models in a natural-like meandering channel}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{JUN 5}},
Abstract = {{The predictive capabilities of an isotropic, eddy viscosity turbulence
   model for closing the unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS)
   equations are systematically investigated by simulating turbulent flow
   through a field-scale meandering channel and comparing the computed
   results with the large-eddy simulation (LES) of the same flow recently
   reported by Kang and Sotiropoulos (2011). To facilitate the comparison
   of the two turbulence models, both RANS simulation and LES are carried
   on exactly the same grid with the same numerical method. The comparisons
   show that while the RANS model captures the curvature-driven secondary
   flow within the bend, it fails completely to predict other key flow
   features in the channel, which are predicted by the LES and also
   observed in flow visualization experiments. These features include the
   inner and outer bank shear layers, the outer bank secondary cell, and
   the inner bank horizontal recirculation zone. By analyzing the results
   of the LES, we conclusively show that flow features not predicted by the
   RANS calculation are located in regions of the flow with high levels of
   turbulence anisotropy. The extent of these regions and, consequently,
   the degree of disagreement between the RANS and LES predictions are
   shown to depend on the stream geometry and the flow rate. Our results
   underscore the major challenges confronting the computationally
   expedient, isotropic RANS models, which are widely used today in
   three-dimensional hydrodynamic and morphodynamic simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Results are reported for a study on the evaporation of water droplets
   from a highly viscoelastic acrylic polymer surface. These are contrasted
   with those collected for the same measurements carried out on
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS). For PDMS, the evaporation process involves
   the expected multistep process including constant drop area, constant
   contact angle, and finally a combination of these steps until the liquid
   is gone. In contrast, water evaporation from the acrylic polymer shows a
   constant drop area mode throughout. Furthermore, during the evaporation
   process, the drop area actually expands on the acrylic polymer. The
   single mode evaporation process is consistent with formation of wetting
   structures, which cannot be propagated by the capillary forces.
   Expansion of the drop area is attributed to the influence of the drop
   capillary pressure. Furthermore, the rate of drop area expansion is
   shown to be dependent on the thickness of the polymer film.}},

Title = {{Effect of neighboring perturbations on drop coalescence at an interface}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Coalescence at a quiescent silicone oil/water glycerine interface was
   investigated for water/glycerine drops with Bond number similar to 7 and
   Ohnesorge number = 0.01 using high-speed imaging and time-resolved
   tomographic particle image velocimetry. In addition to a single drop
   case, three perturbation cases were considered corresponding with a
   second drop, a solid particle wetted in oil, and a solid particle wetted
   in water/glycerine placed adjacent to the coalescing drop. Each
   perturbing object caused an initial tilting of the drop, influencing its
   rupture location and eventual collapse behavior. Once tilted, drops
   typically ruptured near their lowest vertical position which was located
   either toward or away from the perturbing object depending on the case.
   The initial retraction speed of the ruptured film was higher for drops
   initially tilted at significant angles, and the local variations in
   retraction speed correlated well with the expected variations in local
   film thickness. The drop fluid always collapsed away from the drop axis
   in the direction of the rupture location in all unperturbed or perturbed
   cases. In the case of a drop next to a particle wetted in
   water/glycerine, the collapsing fluid travelled away from the particle,
   and the downward propagating vortex ring which developed was similar to
   that resulting from an unperturbed drop rupture. By contrast, the drop
   fluid collapsed toward either a second drop or a particle wetted in oil.
   The resulting vortex rings were more asymmetric, and viscous interaction
   between the particle and collapsing fluid hindered the downward motion
   of the associated ring. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Title = {{Fast Poisson Solvers for Thermal Analysis}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON DESIGN AUTOMATION OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Accurate and efficient thermal analysis for a VLSI chip is crucial, both
   for sign-off reliability verification and for design-time circuit
   optimization. To determine an accurate temperature profile, it is
   important to simulate a die together with its thermal mounts: this
   requires solving Poisson's equation on a nonrectangular 3D domain. This
   article presents a class of eigendecomposition-based Fast Poisson
   Solvers (FPS) for chip-level thermal analysis. We start with a solver
   that solves a rectangular 3D domain with mixed boundary conditions in
   O(N. logN) time, where N is the dimension of the finite difference
   matrix. Then we reveal, for the first time in the literature, a strong
   relation between fast Poisson solvers and Green-function-based methods.
   Finally, we propose an FPS method that leverages the preconditioned
   conjugate gradient method to solve nonrectangular 3D domains
   efficiently. We demonstrate this approach on thermal analysis of an
   industrial microprocessor, showing accurate results verified by a
   commercial tool, and that it solves a system of dimension 4.54e6 in only
   13 conjugate gradient iterations, with a runtime of 65 seconds, a 15X
   speedup over the popular ICCG solver.}},

Abstract = {{Exploiting additional information to improve traditional inductive
   learning is an active research area in machine learning. In many
   supervised-learning applications, training data can be naturally
   separated into several groups, and incorporating this group information
   into learning may improve generalization. Recently, Vapnik proposed a
   general approach to formalizing such problems, known as ``learning with
   structured data{''} and its support vector machine (SVM) based
   optimization formulation called SVM+. Liang and Cherkassky showed the
   connection between SVM+ and multitask learning (MTL) approaches in
   machine learning, and proposed an SVM-based formulation for MTL called
   SVM+ MTL for classification. Training the SVM+ MTL classifier requires
   the solution of a large quadratic programming optimization problem which
   scales as O(n(3)) with sample size n. So there is a need to develop
   computationally efficient algorithms for implementing SVM+ MTL. This
   brief generalizes Platt's sequential minimal optimization (SMO)
   algorithm to the SVM+ MTL setting. Empirical results show that, for
   typical SVM+ MTL problems, the proposed generalized SMO achieves over
   100 times speed-up, in comparison with general-purpose optimization
   routines.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{114}},

Abstract = {{While current approaches have limitations for efficient and
   cost-effective microalgal biofuel production, new processes, which are
   financially economic, environmentally sustainable, and ecologically
   stable, are needed. Typically, microalgae cells are small and grow
   individually. Harvest of these cells is technically difficult and it
   contributes to 20-30\% of the total cost of biomass production. A new
   process of pelletized cell cultivation is described in this study to
   co-culture a filamentous fungal species with microalgae so that
   microalgae cells can be co-pelletized into fungal pellets for easier
   harvest. This new process can be applied to microalgae cultures in both
   autotrophic and heterotrophic conditions to allow microalgae cells
   attach to each other. The cell pellets, due to their large size, can be
   harvested through sieve, much easier than individual cells. This method
   has the potential to significantly decrease the processing cost for
   generating microagal biofuel or other products. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{We present a study of interactive virtual reality visualizations of
   scientific motions as found in biomechanics experiments. Our approach is
   threefold. First, we define a taxonomy of motion visualizations
   organized by the method (animation, interaction, or static presentation)
   used to depict both the spatial and temporal dimensions of the data.
   Second, we design and implement a set of eight example visualizations
   suggested by the taxonomy and evaluate their utility in a quantitative
   user study. Third, together with biomechanics collaborators, we conduct
   a qualitative evaluation of the eight example visualizations applied to
   a current study of human spinal kinematics. Results suggest that
   visualizations in this style that use interactive control for the time
   dimension of the data are preferable to others. Within this category,
   quantitative results support the utility of both animated and
   interactive depictions for space; however, qualitative feedback suggest
   that animated depictions for space should be avoided in biomechanics
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{The depletion of root-available Ca in northern forest soils exposed to
   decades of increased acid deposition adversely affects forest health and
   productivity. Laboratory studies indicated the potential of wood-decay
   fungi to restore lost Ca. This study presents changes in concentration
   of Ca, Mg, and K in sapwood of red spruce (Picea rubens Sarg.), red
   maple (Acer rubrum L.), eastern hemlock (Tsuga canadensis (L.)
   Carriere), and paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marshall) during the decay
   process at two experimental forests for 12 years and to compare
   concentrations of exchangeable Ca, Mg, and Al in decayed wood residues
   at 10 and 12 years with those in the forest floor. Significant loss of
   mass indicated by decreasing wood density occurred after 2-8 years in
   conifers and after only 2 years in hardwoods. A significant gain in wood
   K was observed at 2 years followed by a significant loss at 8 years. A
   negligible gain in Ca concentration occurred at 2 years and a
   substantial gain at 8 years. Observed changes in Mg concentration were
   variable. No significant difference in exchangeable Ca concentration was
   observed between decayed wood residue of spruce and maple and the forest
   floor. However, decayed wood residue had a much lower Al concentration
   and molar Al/Ca ratio, a condition characteristic of sites with high
   root-available Ca.}},

Abstract = {{Nowadays, chemometric applications in biology can readily deal with tens
   of thousands of variables, for instance, in omics and environmental
   analysis. Other areas of chemometrics also deal with distilling relevant
   information in highly information-rich data sets. Traditional tools such
   as the principal component analysis or hierarchical clustering are often
   not optimal for providing succinct and accurate information from high
   rank data sets. A relatively little known approach that has shown
   significant potential in other areas of research is coclustering, where
   a data matrix is simultaneously clustered in its rows and columns
   (objects and variables usually). Coclustering is the tool of choice when
   only a subset of variables is related to a specific grouping among
   objects. Hence, coclustering allows a select number of objects to share
   a particular behavior on a select number of variables. In this paper, we
   describe the basics of coclustering and use three different example data
   sets to show the advantages and shortcomings of coclustering. Copyright

Abstract = {{Aims: Nanoelectrodes are an emerging biomedical technology that can be
   used to record intracellular membrane potentials from neurons while
   causing minimal damage during membrane penetration. Current
   nanoelectrode designs, however, have low aspect ratios or large
   substrates and thus are not suitable for recording from neurons deep
   within complex natural structures, such as brain slices. Materials \&
   methods: We describe a novel nanoelectrode design that uses nanowires
   grown on the ends of microwire recording electrodes similar to those
   frequently used in vivo. Results \& discussion: We demonstrate that
   these nanowires can record intracellular action potentials in a rat
   brain slice preparation and in isolated leech ganglia. Conclusion:
   Nanoelectrodes have the potential to revolutionize intracellular
   recording methods in complex neural tissues, to enable new
   multielectrode array technologies and, ultimately, to be used to record
   intracellular signals in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating in-place volume associated with each well, leading to
   estimation of total reservoir in-place volume, is the cornerstone to any
   reservoir-management practice. Yet, conventional methods do not always
   lend themselves to routine applications, particularly when used in
   singular fashion. However, combining these methods on the same plot has
   considerable merit in that they converge to the same solution when
   material-balance (MB) -derived average-reservoir pressure is used in a
   volumetric system.
   This study presents a systematic procedure for estimating the
   gas-initially-in-place (GIIP) volume when real-time surveillance data of
   pressure, rate, and temperature are available at the wellhead.
   Specifically, we show that log-log diagnosis, followed by combined
   static- and dynamic-MB analysis and transient-productivity-index (PI)
   analysis, leads to consistent solutions. Thermodynamic behavior of
   fluids is also explored to ensure that converted pressures at the
   bottomhole and measured rates have consistency and accuracy for
   reservoir-engineering calculations.
   Layered systems were selected for this study because they represent most
   situations. Two synthetic cases probed issues pertaining to
   average-reservoir-pressure computation with the pseudosteady-state (PSS)
   approach, and two field examples validated the approach presented here.}},

Title = {{Tuning the selectivity of methanol-to-hydrocarbons conversion on H-ZSM-5
   by co-processing olefin or aromatic compounds}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{290}},
Pages = {{186-192}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The product selectivity of dimethyl ether (DME) conversion to
   hydrocarbons on H-ZSM-5 was systematically tuned by co-feeding small
   amounts of C-13-propene and C-13-toluene (4 kPa) with C-12-DME (70 kPa)
   under isoconversion conditions (20.8-22.7 C\%) at 548 K. The selectivity
   to ethene (14.5-18 C\%) and aromatics (7.1-33.7 C\%) increased while
   selectivity to C-4-C-7 aliphatics (42.8-16.9 C\%) decreased with
   increasing amounts of toluene (0-4 kPa) in the co-feed. Similar trends
   were also observed at lower conversions (4.6-5.1 C\%) at 548 K and at
   higher temperatures (623 K), showing that the olefin-to-aromatic ratio
   can be used as a parameter to propagate the olefin- and aromatic-based
   carbon pools to varying extents within the range of conditions studied
   in this work. The co-reaction of C-13-propene with C-12-DME showed that
   C-5-C-7 olefins are formed almost exclusively from methylation reactions
   while butenes are formed from both olefin cracking and methylation
   reactions. The high fraction of propene (55.1\%) with at least one C-12
   indicated that a large fraction of propene is a product of olefin
   cracking reactions. Under conditions in which the aromatic-based cycle
   is dominant (increasing amounts of toluene in the co-feed), both ethene
   and propene contained approximately 10\% C-13 atoms, showing that when
   the olefin-based cycle is suppressed, these light olefins primarily
   originate from the aromatic-based cycle. The C-13 content of toluene in
   the effluent was unchanged compared to that in the C-13-toluene feed,
   implying that toluene is not formed as a significant product.
   Additionally, at least 9.8\% of p-xylene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, and
   1,2,4,5-tetramethylbenzene isotopomers were entirely C-12-labeled, while
   less than 2\% of toluene and o-xylene isotopomers were entirely
   C-12-labeled, showing that under the conditions studied in this work,
   cyclization reactions occur predominantly for C8+ aliphatics to form
   p-xylene and larger aromatics. Because the olefin- and aromatic-based
   cycles are not isolated from one another, understanding communication
   between the two cycles is an important step in controlling selectivity
   of MTH on H-ZSM-5. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Steady-state reaction studies of acetic acid and ethanol were used to
   identify co-adsorbed acetic acid/ethanol dimers as surface intermediates

   dominating surface species, an inactive ethanol dimeric species adsorbed
   on Bronsted sites inhibiting ester formation and a co-adsorbed complex
   of acetic acid and ethanol on the active site reacting to produce ethyl
   acetate, is shown to describe the reaction rate as a function of
   temperature (323-383 K), acetic acid (0.5-6.0 kPa), and ethanol
   (5.0-13.0 kPa) partial pressure on proton-form BEA, FER, MFI, and MOR
   zeolites. Measured differences in rates as a function of zeolite
   structure and the rigorous interpretation of these differences in terms
   of esterification rate and equilibrium constants is presented to show
   that the intrinsic rate constant for the activation of the co-adsorbed

Abstract = {{The effects of storage conditions on the lipid deterioration in
   California almond nuts and sliced were studied. Natural whole almonds
   with or without polyethylene (PE) packaging and blanched whole almonds
   and sliced with PE packaging were stored in 10 different storage

   relative humidity levels. The peroxide values (PVs), iodine values
   (IVs), and free fatty acids (FFAs) were monitored during the storage.
   The PVs in the natural samples did not change noticeably whereas the
   blanched samples changed greatly, indicating that skins may have played
   a significant role. The IVs decreased slightly in the 1st 150 d of
   storage and then leveled off. The slightly faster changes in IVs in the
   blanched samples coincided with the greater changes in PVs in the
   blanched samples. The natural samples exhibited much higher FFA levels
   than the blanched samples after storage. In general, FFA increased with
   increasing storage time, temperature, and humidity. Highest levels of
   FFA were observed in the samples stored at high temperature and high
   humidity.}},

Abstract = {{Standard sumps (manholes) are common features of urban storm water
   collection systems, and there are anecdotes suggesting that standard
   sumps can improve storm water quality. However, no data on the
   effectiveness of sumps as treatment devices for suspended sediment
   removal and the associated required maintenance schedule of the sumps
   could be found. Such data could justify giving pollution prevention
   credit for the use of standard sumps to transportation departments of
   cities, counties, and state agencies. To assess the effectiveness of
   standard sumps as storm water treatment devices, a laboratory study was
   conducted. Three goals were achieved in this study: (1) sediment capture
   and sediment washout were measured in four configurations of a straight
   flow through standard sump; (2) performance functions for the efficiency
   of suspended sediment removal in a standard sump were developed; and (3)
   performance functions for sediment washout from a standard sump were
   developed. To determine whether they remove suspended sediment from
   storm water runoff, two standard sumps of different sizes were tested in
   a laboratory setting. Removal efficiency under low flow conditions and
   washout rates under high flow conditions were measured. The sumps did
   remove suspended sediment at low flows, but at high flows the washout
   rate was substantial. The data collected were used to develop two
   performance functions: one for suspended sediment removal (deposition)
   in a sump at low flow, and one for sediment washout from the sump at
   high flow. Four sump configurations were tested under a wide range of
   flow characteristics. The principal independent variables such as sump
   dimensions, sediment settling velocities, and hydraulic parameters were
   grouped into dimensionless numbers that were related to performance of
   all designs tested. These performance functions can be used to select
   appropriate designs and analyze the performance of existing standard
   sumps. Overall, the data collected show that standard sumps can be used
   as pretreatment devices for storm water if properly selected and
   maintained. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000544. (C) 2012 American

Title = {{Fabrication of Piezoresistive CNT/CNF Cementitious Composites with
   Superplasticizer as Dispersant}},

Abstract = {{Dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/carbon nanofibers (CNFs) in cement
   matrixes is one of the key problems for fabricating piezoresistive
   CNT/CNF cementitious composites. The use of existing dispersants such as
   sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate (NaDDBS),
   and methylcellulose to disperse CNTs/CNFs has negative effects on the
   hydration of cement and will cause decreases in the mechanical
   properties of cementitious composites. In this study, a
   superplasticizer, a commonly used component in cementitious composites,
   is found to be capable of effectively dispersing CNTs and CNFs in a
   cement matrix. This eliminates the need for additional dispersants for
   fabricating piezoresistive CNT/CNF cementitious composites and avoids
   the impairment of composite properties by additional dispersants. The
   dispersion of CNTs/CNFs in cement matrix is evaluated by observing the
   dispersion of CNTs/CNFs in the superplasticizer aqueous solution,
   examining the morphology of composites, and analyzing the discreteness
   of resistance of composites. The piezoresistive responses of the
   composites with different types and concentrations of CNTs and CNFs are
   also investigated. Experimental results show that the fabricated CNT/CNF
   cementitious composites have strong piezoresistive responses, and the
   piezoresistive response sensitivity depends heavily on the types and
   concentrations of CNTs and CNFs. These findings indicate that
   piezoresistive CNT/CNF cementitious composites can be developed only by
   using a typical component of cementitious materials (i.e.,
   superplasticizer) as dispersant and without adding any additional
   dispersants for CNTs/CNFs. DOI: 10.1061/(ASCE)MT.1943-5533.0000435. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on an investigation of transverse joint details with
   tight bend diameter U-bars for accelerated bridge construction. It
   presents the testing results of potential alternate reinforcing
   materials and joint details in two phases. Headed bar and U-bar
   {[}stainless steel and deformed wire reinforcement (DWR)] specimens with
   the same joint detail configuration were tested and compared in Phase I,
   followed by testing of U-bars (DWR) with varied concrete strength, bar
   spacing, and overlap length in Phase II. Test results were evaluated
   based on tension capacity, cracking at service loading and failure, and
   steel strain. A strut-and-tie model is proposed to predict the tension
   capacity of a transverse joint, which is capable of identifying the most
   critical parameters and yields safe and consistent predictions. Based on
   the experimental results, a No. 5 U-bar joint detail with no less than
   152 mm (6 in.) overlap length and No. 4 lacer bars was recommended. DOI:

Abstract = {{Nonbinary low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are of great interest
   due to their better performance cover binary ones when the code length
   is moderate. However, the cost of decoder implementation for these LDPC
   codes is still very high. In this paper, a low-complexity VLSI
   architecture for nonbinary LDPC decoders is presented. By exploiting the
   intrinsic shifting and symmetry properties of nonbinary quasi-cyclic
   LDPC (QC-LDPC) codes, significant reduction of memory size and routing
   complexity can be achieved. These unique features lead to two
   network-efficient decoder architectures for Class-I and Class-II
   nonbinary QC-LDPC codes, respectively. Comparison results with the
   state-of-the-art designs show that for the code example of the 64-ary
   (1260, 630) rate-0.5 Class-I code, the proposed scheme can save up to
   70.6\% hardware required by switch network, which demonstrates the
   efficiency of the proposed technique. The proposed design for the 32-ary
   (992, 496) rate-0.5 Class-II code can achieve a 93.8\% switch network
   complexity reduction compared with conventional approaches. Furthermore,
   with the help of a generator for possible solution sequences, both
   forward and backward steps can be eliminated to offer processing
   convenience of check node unit (CNU) blocks. Results show the proposed
   32-ary (992, 496) rate-0.5 Class-II decoder can achieve 4.47 Mb/s
   decoding throughput at a clock speed of 150 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{Mixtures of hydrogen and carbon monoxide were used to simulate the fuel
   component of synthesis gas and operate a single cylinder engine in
   homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode. The engine was
   originally an air-cooled direct injection (DI) compression ignition (CI)
   engine. The original diesel fuel injection system was removed and a port
   fuel injection (PFI) system with intake air heating was added. The
   engine speed was maintained at a constant 1800 RPM.
   Three synthesis gas fuel compositions were tested, which comprised of
   100\% H-2, 75/25 H-2/CO ratio, and 50/50 H-2/CO ratio, by volume. These
   compositions were investigated at an equivalence ratio (EQR) of 0.26 and
   0.30. In-cylinder pressure and H-2/CO emissions measurements were made
   at all conditions.
   To achieve peak indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP) at a given
   equivalence ratio, the intake air temperature had to be increased with
   increasing CO fraction in the synthesis gas mixture. For the EQR = 0.26
   conditions, the intake air temperature required for best IMEP was 78
   degrees C, 84 degrees C, and 98 degrees C, for 100\% H-2, 75/25 H-2/CO
   ratio, and 50/50 H-2/CO ratio, respectively. For the EQR = 0.30
   conditions, the intake air temperature requirements were 62 degrees C,
   71 degrees C, and 81 degrees C, for the same respective H-2/CO
   proportions. The peak in-cylinder temperatures for all conditions tested
   ranged from roughly 1200 K-1500 K depending on intake air temperature,
   mixture concentration, and fuel composition. The combustion event was
   short, with the rapid burn angle ranging from 9.5 CAD to 11.5 CAD for
   all conditions tested, and the synthesis gas mixture composition did not
   change this significantly. The combustion efficiency was between 83\%
   and 88\% for the peak IMEP conditions tested. Copyright (C) 2012,

Abstract = {{Fluctuation of impedance on defibrillator leads is highly suggestive of
   lead failure. A drop in impedance is associated with insulation defects
   while high impedance is suggestive of lead fracture. In this case
   report, we described a patient where electromagnetic interference from
   radiofrequency ablation near the site of superior vena cava coil caused
   the sensed impedance to fluctuate without uneventful outcomes and we
   discussed the possible mechanism. Both electromagnetic interference and
   defibrillator lead insulation defect can result in low threshold and
   inappropriate shocks. Sometimes electromagnetic interference may result
   in physical damage of the implanted system and may result in subsequent
   fluctuations in impedance. Awareness of electromagnetic interference
   that can cause fluctuating impedance without structural damage can help
   in making appropriate diagnosis and may avoid unnecessary procedures.

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The classic results of de Gennes and Odijk describe the mobility of a
   semiflexible chain confined in a nanochannel only in the limits of very
   weak and very strong confinement, respectively. Using Monte Carlo
   sampling of the Kirkwood diffusivity with full hydrodynamic
   interactions, we show that the mobility of a semiflexible chain exhibits
   a broad plateau as a function of extension before transitioning to an
   Odijk regime, and that the width of the plateau depends on the
   anisotropy of the monomers. For the particular case of DNA in a high
   ionic strength buffer, which has highly anisotropic monomers, we predict
   that this Rouse-like behavior will be observed over most of the
   measurable chain extensions seen in experiments.}},

Journal = {{WATER RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{46}},

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{The presence of micropollutants can be a concern for land application of
   biosolids. Of particular interest are nonylphenol diethoxylate (NP2EO),
   nonylphenol monoethoxylate (NP1EO), and nonylphenol (NP), collectively
   referred to as NPE, which accumulate in anaerobically digested biosolids
   and are subject to regulation based on the environmental risks
   associated with them. Because biosolids are a valuable nutrient
   resource, it is essential that we understand how various treatment
   processes impact the fate of NPE in biosolids. Thermal hydrolysis (TH)
   coupled with mesophilic anaerobic digestion (MAD) is an advanced
   digestion process that destroys pathogens in biosolids and increases
   methane yields and volatile solids destruction. We investigated the
   impact of thermal hydrolysis pretreatment on the subsequent
   biodegradation of NPE in digested biosolids. Biosolids were treated with
   TH, anaerobic digestion, and aerobic digestion in laboratory-scale
   reactors, and NPE were analyzed in the influent and effluent of the
   digesters. NP2EO and NP1EO have been observed to degrade to the more
   estrogenic NP under anaerobic conditions; therefore, changes in the
   ratio of NP:NPE were of interest. The increase in NP:NPE following MAD
   was 56\%; the average increase of this ratio in four sets of TH-MAD
   samples, however, was only 24.6 +/- 3.1\%. In addition, TH experiments
   performed in pure water verified that, during TH, the high temperature
   and pressure alone did not directly destroy NPE; TH experiments with NP
   added to sludge also showed that NP was not destroyed by the high
   temperature and pressure of TH when in a more complex sludge matrix. The
   post-aerobic digestion phases removed NPE, regardless of whether TH
   pretreatment occurred. This research indicates that changes in biosolids
   processing can have impacts beyond just gas production and solids
   destruction. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{3032-3042}},
Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Most treatment practices for urban runoff capture pollutants such as
   phosphorus by either settling or filtration while dissolved phosphorus,
   typically as phosphates, is untreated. Dissolved phosphorus, however,
   represents an average 45\% of total phosphorus in stormwater runoff and
   can be more than 95\%. In this study, a new stormwater treatment
   technology to capture phosphate, called the Minnesota Filter, is
   introduced. The filter comprises iron filings mixed with sand and is
   tested for phosphate removal from synthetic stormwater. Results indicate
   that sand mixed with 5\% iron filings captures an average of 88\%
   phosphate for at least 200 m of treated depth, which is significantly
   greater than a sand filter without iron filings. Neither incorporation
   of iron filings into a sand filter nor capture of phosphates onto iron
   filings in column experiments had a significant effect on the hydraulic
   conductivity of the filter at mixtures of 5\% or less iron by weight.
   Field applications with up to 10.7\% iron were operated over 1 year
   without detrimental effects upon hydraulic conductivity. A model is
   applied and fit to column studies to predict the field performance of
   iron-enhanced sand filters. The model predictions are verified through
   the predicted performance of the filters in removing phosphates in field
   applications.' Practical applications of the technology, both existing
   and proposed, are presented so stormwater managers can begin
   implementation. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a methodology based on multivariate data analysis
   for identifying input sources of perfluoroallkyl substances (PFASs)
   detected in 37 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) across more than 40
   cities in the state of Minnesota (USA). Exploratory analysis of data
   points has been carried out by unsupervised pattern recognition (cluster
   analysis), correlation analysis, ANOVA and per capita discharges in an
   attempt to discriminate sources of PFASs in WWTPs. Robust cluster
   solutions grouped the database according to the different PFAS profiles
   in WWTP influent. Significantly elevated levels of perfluorohexanoic
   acid (PFHxA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and/or perfluorooctane
   sulfonate (PFOS) in influent have been found in 18 out of 37 WWTPs
   (49\%). A substantial increase in the concentrations of PFHxA and/or
   PFOA from influent to effluent was observed in 59\% of the WWTPs
   surveyed, suggestive of high concentration inputs of precursors. The
   fate of one precursor (8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol) in WWTP was modeled
   based on fugacity analysis to understand the increasing effluent
   concentration. Furthermore, population-related emissions cannot wholly
   explain the occurrence and levels of PFASs in WWTPs. Unusually high
   influent levels of PFASs were observed in WWTPs located in specific
   industrial areas or where known contamination had taken place. Despite
   the restriction on the production/use of PFOA and PFOS, this paper
   demonstrates that wastewater from industrial activities is still a
   principal determinant of PFAS pollution in urban watersheds. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Objective: In the present study, we have developed a novel
   patient-specific rule-based seizure prediction system for focal
   neocortical epilepsy.
   Methods: Five univariate measures including correlation dimension,
   correlation entropy, noise level, Lempel-Ziv complexity, and largest
   Lyapunov exponent as well as one bivariate measure, nonlinear
   interdependence, were extracted from non-overlapping 10-s segments of
   intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) data recorded using electrodes
   implanted deep in the brain and/or placed on the cortical surface. The
   spatio-temporal information was then integrated by using rules
   established based on patient-specific changes observed in the period
   prior to a seizure sample for each patient. The system was tested on 316
   h of iEEG data containing 49 seizures recorded in 11 patients with
   medically intractable focal neocortical epilepsy.
   Results: For seizure occurrence periods of 30 and 50 min our method
   showed an average sensitivity of 79.9\% and 90.2\% with an average false
   prediction rate of 0.17 and 0.11/h, respectively. In terms of
   sensitivity and false prediction rate, the system showed superiority to
   random and periodical predictors.
   Conclusions: The nonlinear analysis of iEEG in the period prior to
   seizures revealed patient-specific spatio-temporal changes that were
   significantly different from those observed within baselines in the
   majority of the seizures analyzed in this study.
   Significance: The present results suggest that the patient specific
   rule-based approach may become a potentially useful approach for
   predicting seizures prior to onset. (C) 2012 International Federation of

Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The power of sparse signal modeling with learned overcomplete
   dictionaries has been demonstrated in a variety of applications and
   fields, from signal processing to statistical inference and machine
   learning. However, the statistical properties of these models, such as
   underfitting or overfitting given sets of data, are still not well
   characterized in the literature. As a result, the success of sparse
   modeling depends on hand-tuning critical parameters for each data and
   application. This work aims at addressing this by providing a practical
   and objective characterization of sparse models by means of the minimum
   description length (MDL) principle-a well-established
   information-theoretic approach to model selection in statistical
   inference. The resulting framework derives a family of efficient sparse
   coding and dictionary learning algorithms which, by virtue of the MDL
   principle, are completely parameter free. Furthermore, such framework
   allows to incorporate additional prior information to existing models,
   such as Markovian dependencies, or to define completely new problem
   formulations, including in the matrix analysis area, in a natural way.
   These virtues will be demonstrated with parameter-free algorithms for
   the classic image denoising and classification problems, and for
   low-rank matrix recovery in video applications. However, the framework
   is not limited to this imaging data, and can be applied to a wide range
   of signal and data types and tasks.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3308-3313}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Relative to batch alternatives, the recursive least-squares (RLS)
   algorithm has well-appreciated merits of reduced complexity and storage
   requirements for online processing of stationary signals, and also for
   tracking slowly-varying nonstationary signals. However, RLS is
   challenged when in addition to noise, outliers are also present in the
   data due to, e. g., impulsive disturbances. Existing robust RLS
   approaches are resilient to outliers, but require the nominal noise to
   be white-an assumption that may not hold in e. g., sensor networks where
   neighboring sensors are affected by correlated ambient noise.
   Prewhitening with the known noise covariance is not a viable option
   because it spreads the outliers to noncontaminated measurements, which
   leads to inefficient utilization of the available data and
   unsatisfactory performance. In this correspondence, a robust RLS
   algorithm is developed capable of handling outliers and correlated noise
   simultaneously. In the proposed method, outliers are treated as nuisance
   variables and estimated jointly with the wanted parameters.
   Identifiability is ensured by exploiting the sparsity of outliers, which
   is effected via regularizing the least-squares (LS) criterion with the
   l(1)-norm of the outlier vectors. This leads to an optimization problem
   whose solution yields the robust RLS estimates. For low-complexity
   real-time operation, a suboptimal online algorithm is proposed, which
   entails closed-form updates per time step in the spirit of RLS.
   Simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and improved performance of
   the proposed method in comparison with the nonrobust RLS, and its
   state-of-the-art robust renditions.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to develop parallel pipelined
   architectures for the fast Fourier transform (FFT). A formal procedure
   for designing FFT architectures using folding transformation and
   register minimization techniques is proposed. Novel parallel-pipelined
   architectures for the computation of complex and real valued fast
   Fourier transform are derived. For complex valued Fourier transform
   (CFFT), the proposed architecture takes advantage of under utilized
   hardware in the serial architecture to derive L-parallel architectures
   without increasing the hardware complexity by a factor of L. The
   operating frequency of the proposed architecture can be decreased which
   in turn reduces the power consumption. Further, this paper presents new
   parallel-pipelined architectures for the computation of real-valued fast
   Fourier transform (RFFT). The proposed architectures exploit redundancy
   in the computation of FFT samples to reduce the hardware complexity. A
   comparison is drawn between the proposed designs and the previous
   architectures. The power consumption can be reduced up to 37\% and 50\%
   in 2-parallel CFFT and RFFT architectures, respectively. The output
   samples are obtained in a scrambled order in the proposed architectures.
   Circuits to reorder these scrambled output sequences to a desired order

Abstract = {{Recently, diffusion tensor MRI has been utilized as a tool to
   reconstruct, with high resolution, the three-dimensional myofiber
   orientation of hearts ex vivo. However, because of limited availability
   of human hearts, it is common to recover specimens postmortem, after
   some degree of decomposition has occurred. In this study, we describe
   the ability to reconstruct local fiber orientation within a unique set
   of human hearts using diffusion tensor MRI; relative effects of specimen
   decomposition were also assessed. The mean diffusivity, fractional
   anisotropy, and principal eigenvalues (E1, E2, and E3) were measured in
   hearts with varying postmortem intervals from 0 to 27 days (n = 17), and
   local fiber orientations were reconstructed. Mean diffusivities and
   principal eigenvalues nonlinearly increased as a function of postmortem
   interval, while fractional anisotropies nonlinearly decreased. There
   were good correlations between postmortem intervals and changes in
   diffusion properties after linear transformation of the data (R2 > 0.7).
   Thus, we determined that there were regional discontinuities in the
   reconstruction of local fiber orientation in hearts where postmortem
   intervals were greater than 3 days. Therefore, any delay in tissue
   fixation after death (if not properly preserved using organ
   transplantation techniques) will compromise measurement of fiber
   orientation and delineation of diseased pathology, e.g., based, in part,
   on fractional anisotropy. Magn Reson Med, 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley

Abstract = {{This paper deals with load control in a multiple-residence setup. The
   utility company adopts a cost function representing the cost of
   providing energy to end-users. Each residential end-user has a base
   load, two types of adjustable loads, and possibly a storage device. The
   first load type must consume a specified amount of energy over the
   scheduling horizon, but the consumption can be adjusted across different
   slots. The second type does not entail a total energy requirement, but
   operation away from a user-specified level results in user
   dissatisfaction. The research issue amounts to minimizing the
   electricity provider cost plus the total user dissatisfaction, subject
   to the individual constraints of the loads. The problem can be solved by
   a distributed subgradient method. The utility company and the end-users
   exchange information through the Advanced Metering Infrastructure
   (AMI)-a two-way communication network-in order to converge to the
   optimal amount of electricity production and the optimal power
   consumption schedule. The algorithm finds near-optimal schedules even
   when AMI messages are lost, which can happen in the presence of
   malfunctions or noise in the communications network. The algorithm
   amounts to a subgradient iteration with outdated Lagrange multipliers,
   for which convergence results of wide scope are established.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses training-sequence-based joint timing

   estimates are obtained by maximum-likelihood estimation based on a

   the minimum mean squared error criterion is performed. The simulation
   results show that the proposed approach has excellent performance of
   timing synchronization in several channel models at low signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR) which is smaller than 1dB. Moreover, for a low-density
   parity-check coded 1x2 single-input multiple-output OFDM system with

Abstract = {{While copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) thin film solar cells with
   laboratory efficiencies exceeding 20\% have been reported, these high
   efficiencies may degrade with time as the devices are exposed to humid
   environments. Specifically, it is well known that water can diffuse to
   the CIGS-CdS-ZnO heterojunction. This penetration must be reduced or
   stopped to increase the solar cell lifetime. Herein, we show that tin
   dioxide layers deposited on top of completed CIGS solar cells can
   significantly increase the device lifetime by forming a barrier against
   water diffusion. Specifically, in accelerated damp-heat tests, our best
   results showed that initially 8-12\% efficient CIGS solar cells did not
   decay from this peak efficiency even after 240 h at 85 degrees C and
   85\% relative humidity. In comparison, under identical test conditions,
   the solar cells without the tin dioxide layer lost nearly 80\% of their
   initial efficiency, within 24 h after commencing the test. We deposited
   the tin dioxide films by radio frequency magnetron sputtering from tin
   dioxide targets at 5 mTorr. Semicrystalline SnO2 films deposited at room
   temperature had SnO2 nanocrystals embedded in amorphous SnO2 without
   grain boundaries. The semicrystalline films exhibited better damp-heat
   stability than crystalline films deposited at higher temperature. We
   infer from the slow open circuit voltage decay that water permeation to
   the p-n junction is reduced when semicrystalline SnO2 overlayers are
   used to protect the solar cell. We attribute this difference in damp
   heat stability to the lack of grain boundary water diffusion in
   semicrystalline SnO2 films. (C) 2012 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Fusegates are independent units held only by the gravity installed on
   the free spillway of existing dams in order to increase reservoir
   storage and/or discharge capacity. Increasing reservoir storage in many
   dams can partly sacrifice dam's reliabilities. So considering the
   failure risk of a dam together with the amount of increase in the
   reservoir capacity can prevent selecting fusegates which seriously
   endanger a dam safety. However, Lack of accurate information on various
   damage functions and difficulty in quantifying failure consequences are
   among principal limitations that hinder practical application of
   conventional approaches which account failure risk in real world
   hydrosystems problems. This study develops two effective multi-objective
   frameworks to optimize fusegates' configuration in order to eliminate
   the need for such hard-to-get mathematical damage functions and provide
   valuable information on the failure risk, total cost, and increased
   water volume of a reservoir. The proposed models find trade-off
   solutions between two sets of conflicting objectives. The first
   competing objectives is investment cost and water storage and the second
   conflicting goals are water storage and failure probability under the
   inherent and parameter hydrologic uncertainties. Complicated flood
   routing phenomenon within a reservoir equipped with fusegates is
   explicitly taken into account to attain a more cost-effective and
   reliable design without jeopardizing the dam safety. Applicability and
   performance of the developed optimization schemes are discussed and
   demonstrated on a real life case study. The multi-objective optimization
   results represented as an ensemble of diverse trade-off solutions
   provide decision makers with more insight and understanding of system
   behavior and different design alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Clutch shift control is critical for efficient and high-performance
   transmission designs, including automatic, dual clutch, and hybrid
   transmissions. To ensure a smooth clutch to clutch shift, appropriate
   controls for two consecutive processes are critical. One is the precise
   coordination between the on-coming and off-going clutches, which
   requires the on-coming clutch to be filled and ready for engagement at
   the predetermined time (clutch fill). The other is the proper torque
   control during clutch engagement. In this paper, we will investigate the
   closed-loop ``wet{''} clutch control enabled by a pressure sensor in the
   clutch chamber. The main challenges of the pressure-based ``wet{''}
   clutch control lie in the complex nonlinear dynamics due to the
   interactions between the fluid and the mechanical systems, the ON/OFF
   behavior of the clutch assembly, the time-varying clutch loading
   condition, the required short time duration for a precise and robust
   clutch shift, and the lack of the displacement information. To enable
   precise and robust pressure-based control, this paper focuses on the
   following three aspects. First, a clutch dynamic model is constructed
   and validated, which precisely captures the system dynamics in a wide
   pressure range. Second, a sliding-mode controller is designed to achieve
   robust pressure control while avoiding the chattering effect. Finally,
   an observer is constructed to estimate the clutch piston motion, which
   is not only a necessary term in the nonlinear controller design but also
   a diagnosis tool for the clutch fill process. To validate the proposed
   methods, a transmission clutch fixture has been designed and built in
   the laboratory. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
   and robustness of the proposed controller and observer.}},

Abstract = {{Clutch fill control is the key enabler for a smooth clutch-to-clutch
   shift, which is critical for the performance and fuel economy of both
   automatic and hybrid transmissions. While a precise and robust clutch
   fill is crucial, its control is very challenging as the traditional
   approach is still in the open-loop fashion due to the lack of a feedback
   sensor. To address this challenge, a new clutch actuation mechanism is
   proposed, which realizes an internal feedback structure without any
   sensor measurement. The proposed mechanism is novel as it embeds all the
   control elements in the orifice area regulation, which successfully
   solves the precise and robust control of the hydraulic system with
   nonlinear dynamics. In this paper, we first present the working
   principle of the new clutch actuation mechanism. Then, the mechanical
   system design is shown and the system dynamic model is built. To this
   end, the proposed internal feedback control mechanism is fabricated and
   validated in a transmission testing fixture. The new mechanism
   performance is finally presented through a series of simulation and
   experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) are finding increasing applications
   in various areas of industry and medicine. PSAs are a special class of
   viscoelastic polymers that form strong adhesive joints with substrates
   of varying chemical nature under application of light external bonding
   pressures (110 Pa) over short periods of time (15 s). To be a PSA, a
   polymer should possess both high fluidity under applied bonding
   pressure, to form good adhesive contact, and high cohesive strength and
   elasticity, which are necessary for resistance to debonding stresses and
   for dissipation of mechanical energy at the stage of adhesive bond
   failure under detaching force. For rational design of novel PSAs,
   molecular insight into mechanisms of their adhesive behavior is
   necessary. As shown in this review, strength of PSA adhesive joints is
   controlled by a combination of diffusion, viscoelastic, and relaxation
   mechanisms. At the molecular level, strong adhesion is the result of a
   narrow balance between two generally conflicting properties: high
   cohesive strength and large free volume. These conflicting properties
   are difficult to combine in a single polymer material. Individually,
   high cohesive interaction energy and large free volume are necessary but
   insufficient prerequisites for PSA strength. Evident correlations are
   observed between the adhesive bond strengths of different PSAs, and
   their relaxation behaviors are described by longer relaxation times.
   Innovative PSAs with tailored properties can be produced by physical
   mixing of nonadhesive long- and short-chain linear parent polymers, with
   groups at the two ends of the short chains complementary to the
   functional groups in the recurring units of the long chains. Although
   chemical composition and molecular structure of such innovative
   adhesives are unrelated to those of conventional PSAs, their mechanical
   properties and adhesive behaviors obey the same general laws, such as
   the Dahlquist's criterion of tack. (C) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J

Abstract = {{The hydrophilic nature of graphene oxide sheets can be tailored by
   varying the carbon to oxygen ratio. Depending on this ratio, the
   particles can be deposited at either a water air or a water-oil
   interface. Upon compression of thus-created Langmuir monolayers, the
   sheets cover the entire interface, assembling into a strong, compact
   layer of tiled graphene oxide sheets. With further compression, the
   particle layer forms wrinkles that are reversible upon expansion,
   resembling the behavior of an elastic membrane. In the present work, we
   investigate under which conditions the structure and properties of the
   interfacial layer are such that free-standing films can be obtained. The
   interfacial rheological properties of these films are investigated using
   both compressional experiments and shear rheometry. The role of surface
   rheology in potential applications of such tiled films is explored. The
   rheological properties are shown to be responsible for the efficiency of
   such layers in stabilizing water-oil emulsions. Moreover, because of the
   mechanical integrity, large-area monolayers can be deposited by, for
   example, Langmuir-Blodgett techniques using aqueous subphases. These
   films can be turned into transparent conductive films upon subsequent
   chemical reduction.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{MAY 23}},
Abstract = {{Field data and laboratory experiments suggest that bedrock wear from
   debris flows is largely due to particle-bed impacts, rather than solely
   due to abrasion by sliding, and that the associated bedrock erosion
   rates are dependent on the particle size distribution in the debris
   flow. Here we use Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations with an
   established contact mechanics model to explore grain-size influences on
   contact forces associated with particle-bed impacts in sheared granular
   mixtures. We first compare DEM simulations with experimental
   observations obtained from shallow granular flows in rotating drums of
   diameters 0.56 m and 4.0 m. Our simulations reproduce, without parameter
   tuning, experimentally measured segregation, boundary pressures, and
   height profiles. We perform additional simulations systematically
   varying particle size distributions in binary mixtures. We show that
   local time-averaged boundary pressures in thin flows are essentially the
   normal component of the weight of the flow, independent of particle size
   distribution. However, other statistical measures of boundary forces
   scale with mass-averaged particle size. We demonstrate that this is
   because individual particle-bed impacts, rather than impacts from
   multiple particle collisions, dominate the largest contact forces. We
   show that these largest impact forces vary as the square of grain size
   and the 1.2 power of impact velocity as predicted from the contact
   mechanics model underlying the DEM. These results support the particle
   size dependence of a recently proposed bedrock incision model and
   suggest that next steps for a predictive bedrock incision model require
   the statistics of the largest impact velocities.}},

Abstract = {{The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon mutagenesis system is a powerful
   tool that facilitates the discovery of mutations that accelerate
   tumorigenesis. In this study, we sought to identify mutations that
   cooperate with MYC, one of the most commonly dysregulated genes in human
   malignancy. We performed a forward genetic screen with a mouse model of
   MYC-induced liver cancer using SB-mediated mutagenesis. We sequenced
   insertions in 63 liver tumor nodules and identified at least 16
   genes/loci that contribute to accelerated tumor development.
   RNAi-mediated knockdown in a liver progenitor cell line further validate
   three of these genes, Ncoa2/Src-2, Zfx, and Dtnb, as tumor suppressors
   in liver cancer. Moreover, deletion of Ncoa2/Src-2 in mice predisposes
   to diethylnitrosamine-induced liver tumorigenesis. These findings reveal
   genes and pathways that functionally restrain MYC-mediated liver
   tumorigenesis and therefore may provide targets for cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The advantages of ultra-high magnetic field (7 Tesla) MRI for basic
   science research and neuroscience applications have proven invaluable.
   Structural and functional MR images of the human brain acquired at 7 T
   exhibit rich information content with potential utility for clinical
   applications. However, (1) substantial increases in susceptibility
   artifacts, and (2) geometrical distortions at 7 T would be detrimental
   for stereotactic surgeries such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), which
   typically use 1.5 T images for surgical planning. Here, we explore
   whether these issues can be addressed, making feasible the use of 7 T
   MRI to guide surgical planning. Twelve patients with Parkinson's
   disease, candidates for DBS, were scanned on a standard clinical 1.5 T
   MRI and a 7 T MRI scanner. Qualitative and quantitative assessments of
   global and regional distortion were evaluated based on anatomical
   landmarks and transformation matrix values. Our analyses show that
   distances between identical landmarks on 1.5 T vs. 7 T, in the mid-brain
   region, were less than one voxel, indicating a successful
   co-registration between the 1.5 T and 7 T images under these specific
   imaging parameter sets. On regional analysis, the central part of the
   brain showed minimal distortion, while inferior and frontal areas
   exhibited larger distortion due to proximity to air-filled cavities. We
   conclude that 7 T MR images of the central brain regions have comparable
   distortions to that observed on a 1.5 T MRI, and that clinical
   applications targeting structures such as the STN, are feasible with
   information-rich 7 T imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Undoped hematite nanowire arrays grown using plasma oxidation of iron
   foils show significant photoactivity (similar to 0.38 mA cm(-2) at 1.5 V
   versus reversible hydrogen electrode in 1 M KOH). In contrast, thermally
   oxidized nanowire arrays grown on iron exhibit no photoactivity due to
   the formation of a thick (> 7 mu m Fe1-xO) interfacial layer. An
   atmospheric plasma oxidation process required only a few minutes to
   synthesize hematite nanowire arrays with a 1-5 mu m interfacial layer of
   magnetite between the nanowire arrays and the iron substrate. An
   amorphous oxide surface layer on hematite nanowires, if present, is
   shown to decrease the resulting photoactivity of as-synthesized, plasma
   grown nanowire arrays. The photocurrent onset potential is improved
   after removing the amorphous surface on the nanowires using an acid
   etch. A two-step method involving high temperature nucleation followed
   by growth at low temperature is shown to produce a highly dense and

Abstract = {{Using density functional theory + Hubbard U (DFT + U) calculations, we
   investigate the spin states and nuclear hyperfine interactions of iron
   incorporated in magnesium silicate (MgSiO3) post-perovskite (Ppv), a
   major mineral phase in the Earth's D `' layer, where the pressure ranges
   from similar to 120 to 135 GPa. In this pressure range, ferrous iron
   (Fe2+) substituting for magnesium at the dodecahedral (A) site remains
   in the high-spin (HS) state; intermediate-spin (IS) and low-spin (IS)
   states are highly unfavorable. As to ferric iron (Fe3+), which
   substitutes magnesium at the A site and silicon at the octahedral (B)
   site to form (Mg,Fe)(Si,Fe)O-3 Ppv, we find the combination of HS Fe3+
   at the A site and IS Fe3+ at the B site the most favorable. Neither
   A-site nor B-site Fe3+ undergoes a spin-state crossover in the D `'
   pressure range. The computed iron quadrupole splittings are consistent
   with those observed in Mossbauer spectra. The effects of Fe2+ and Fe3+
   on the equation of state of Ppv are found nearly identical, expanding
   the unit cell volume while barely affecting the bulk modulus. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Perpendicular exchange coupled composite structures were prepared,
   utilizing L1(0)-FePt as the magnetic hard layer and {[}Co/Ni](N)
   multilayers as the soft layer. Sharp reduction of the switching field
   was observed with increasing periodic number N of {[}Co/Ni](N)
   multilayers. By inserting a thin Pt interlayer between L1(0)-FePt and
   {[}Co/Ni](N) layers, it is found that in order to get the best of
   exchange coupled composites, different interlayer coupling stiffness was
   required in the composites with different soft layer thickness.
   Furthermore, the angular variation of the coercivity and remanent
   coercivity shows high angular tolerance to applied field angle, and
   reveals the evolution of magnetization reversal from incoherent
   rotational mode to dominant wall motion with increasing thickness of
   soft layer. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{Genistein and daidzein are two estrogenic compounds derived from plants,
   especially legumes. This research begins to explore their environmental
   fate, focusing on direct and indirect photolysis. UV-visible spectra for
   both compounds at varying pH values were taken, the pK(a) values for
   both compounds were measured, and UV visible spectra for each
   protonation state were determined. The loss of both compounds in
   deionized water was observed upon exposure to natural sunlight, and the
   quantum yields were determined for each protonation state. In
   Mississippi River water, direct photolysis does not account for all of
   the loss of genistein and daidzein. The mechanism of indirect photolysis
   was probed using quenchers and sensitizers, and results suggest that
   daidzein is transformed mainly via direct photolysis and singlet
   oxygenation, while gcnistein is transformed mainly via reaction with
   triplet-state natural organic matter. The parameters determined in this
   study will allow for estimation of the concentration of genistein and
   daidzein in sunlit surface waters, which will allow for assessment of
   any risks posed to aquatic wildlife.}},

Title = {{A trust prediction framework in rating-based experience sharing social
   networks without a Web of Trust}},
Journal = {{INFORMATION SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{191}},

Abstract = {{As online experience sharing sites have become one of the popular
   collaborative online communities, people are easily able to share their
   good and bad experiences on various products and services with a large
   number of unknown people as well as their friends. These experience
   sharing communities try to encourage social interaction among people and
   facilitate experience sharing and dissemination with satisfaction. The
   social interactions among users in such online communities are
   constructed based on trust that is established from each user's
   subjective perspective on the experiences in the community. Since a
   robust trust system is vital in experience sharing online communities,
   we therefore propose a computational trust framework for predicting a
   degree of trust or trust-connection between a pair of users. The Web of
   Trust, which consists of explicit trust rating among users, is not
   always available and is typically sparse, so the proposed framework does
   not rely on a Web of Trust. The proposed trust system measures a degree
   of trust based on users' expertise and preferences regarding topics
   (i.e. categories), using users feedback rating data which are available
   and much denser than a Web of Trust. In order to derive a more
   personalized degree of trust, the expertise- and preference-based trust
   is refined with each user's subjective and direct experiences with
   community members as well as a target user. The empirical experiments
   show that our proposed trust framework is quite promising in
   ratings-based online experience sharing communities, even when there are
   not enough user feedback ratings to predict a degree of trust. (C) 2012

   plastically deform under uniaxial strain, unlike brittle PCHE. Both
   CECEC and CPCPC pentablock copolymers exhibited ductile tensile
   behavior, but the tensile properties of blends of these two pentablock
   copolymers show that the addition of crystallinity in the minority phase
   prevents strain softening after yielding and necking, which indicates
   that these samples deform only via crazing. On the other hand, the white
   gage region of CPCPC and the ability of CPCPC to neck indicate that high
   C content materials deform via shear yielding and crazing when the
   minority component is a rubbery material. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{Oxythermal habitat parameters and identifying cisco refuge lakes in

   periods}},
Journal = {{ECOLOGICAL MODELLING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{232}},
Pages = {{14-27}},

Abstract = {{Fish habitat in lakes is strongly constrained by water temperature (T)
   and available dissolved oxygen (DO). With climate warming both of these
   water quality parameters will change. A fish habitat simulation model
   was developed to calculate an oxythermal habitat variable, TDO3, i.e.
   water temperature at 3 mg/L of DO, from simulated daily T and DO
   profiles and used to determine potential refuge lakes for lake herring
   or cisco (Coregonus artedi) in Minnesota. Daily T and DO profiles were
   simulated using a deterministic, unsteady, one-dimensional (vertical)
   year-round lake water quality model (MINLAKE2010) that was developed
   specifically for transparent deep lakes. Profiles for thirty Minnesota
   cisco lakes were simulated with the MINLAKE2010 model using recorded
   (1961-2008) weather data or projected future climate scenarios (CGCM 3.1
   and MIROC 3.2) as model input. The average of daily TDO3 values (called
   ATDO3(VB)) over a 31-day sliding or variable benchmark period (VB), was
   first calculated from daily TDO3 values. The annual maximum of ATDO3(VB)
   was retained for each simulated lake and year, and the average of 47
   ATDO3(VB) values (called AvgATD3(VB)) obtained for the 1962-2008
   simulation period was compared to oxythermal stress criteria for cisco
   determined from the analysis of field data. Isopleths of AvgATD3(VB)
   were interpolated for the 30 simulated lakes on a plot of Secchi depth
   vs. lake geometry ratio used as indicators of trophic state and summer
   mixing conditions, respectively. Marking the 620 Minnesota lakes with
   identified cisco populations on the plot of AvgATD3(VB) allowed to
   partition the 620 lakes into the three tiers depending on where they
   fell between the isopleths: lakes with AvgATD3(VB) <= 11 degrees C (Tier
   1 lakes) were selected to be most suitable for cisco; lakes with 11
   degrees C < AvgATD3(VB) <= 17 degrees C (Tier 2 lakes) had suitable
   habitat for cisco; and non-refuge lakes with AvgATD3(VB) > 17 degrees C
   (Tier 3 lakes) would support cisco only at a reduced probability of
   occurrence or not at all. About 160 existing cisco lakes were thus
   projected to be suitable refuge lakes (Tier 1 plus Tier 2) under the two
   future climate scenarios. The remaining lakes were projected to loose
   their cisco supporting ability. The methodology to identify the refuge
   lakes was applied to a cisco kill that occurred in 18 cisco lakes in
   Minnesota in the hot summer of 2006, and was able to identify the
   majority of these lakes as non-refuge lakes. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

   domains containing an 0 core surrounded by a shell of S that screens
   unfavorable segment segment interactions with an I-rich matrix. TEM
   analysis reveals a QC morphology with 12-fold rotational symmetry but
   devoid of long-range translational order, along with locally coordinated

Abstract = {{In this work, we perform first-principles DFT calculations to
   investigate the interplay between magnetic and structural properties in
   Ni2MnGa. We demonstrate that the relative stability of austenite (cubic)
   and non-modulated martensite (tetragonal) phases depends critically on
   the magnetic interactions between Mn atoms. While standard approximate
   DFT functionals stabilize the latter phase, a more accurate treatment of
   electronic localization and magnetism, obtained with DFT + U, suppresses
   the non-modulated tetragonal structure for the stoichiometric compound,
   in better agreement with experiments. We show that the Anderson impurity
   model, with Mn atoms treated as magnetic impurities, can explain this
   observation and that the fine balance between super-exchange RKKY type
   interactions mediated by Ni d and Ga p orbitals determines the
   equilibrium structure of the crystal. The Anderson model is also
   demonstrated to capture the effect of the number of valence electrons
   per unit cell on the structural properties, often used as an empirical
   parameter to tune the behavior of Ni2MnGa based alloys. Finally, we show
   that off-stoichiometric compositions with excess Mn promote transitions
   to a non-modulated tetragonal structure, in agreement with experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Coke-oven gas (COG), a byproduct of the coking process, has a relatively
   large fraction of hydrogen (H-2). However, most COG is combusted away
   directly, resulting in serious waste of resources. Taking advantage of a
   separation gas mixture containing H-2, we used a hydrate separation
   method in this work to recover H-2 from COG. The formation conditions of
   COG hydrate were measured in 6 mol \% tetrahydrofuran (THF) solution,
   which could significantly reduce COG hydrate formation pressures and
   make it possible to realize the industrial application of the separation
   technology. On this basis, the separation experiments were conducted in
   THF solution and THF-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) solution,
   respectively. The experimental results of two-stage separation of COG
   via hydrate formation were obtained, and the effects of SDS on the
   reaction velocity were investigated as well. The results show that after
   one-stage separation, the content of H-2 in residual gas can be
   increased from 48.41 mol \% to about 65 mol \%, and the recovery of H-2
   ranges from 81\% to 96\%. After two-stage separation, the content of H-2
   in residual gas ranges from 76 mol \% to 84 mol \%, and the recovery of
   H-2 is between 72\% and 91\%. With the presence of SDS, the hydration
   reaction velocity is sped up to some extent, and the induction time and
   reaction time of hydrate formation are greatly shortened.}},

   Experts in Community Question Answering}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Community Question Answering (CQA) services enable their users to
   exchange knowledge in the form of questions and answers. These
   communities thrive as a result of a small number of highly active users,
   typically called experts, who provide a large number of high-quality
   useful answers. Expert identification techniques enable community
   managers to take measures to retain the experts in the community. There
   is further value in identifying the experts during the first few weeks
   of their participation as it would allow measures to nurture and retain
   them. In this article we address two problems: (a) How to identify
   current experts in CQA? and (b) How to identify users who have potential
   of becoming experts in future (potential experts)? In particular, we
   propose a probabilistic model that captures the selection preferences of
   users based on the questions they choose for answering. The
   probabilistic model allows us to run machine learning methods for
   identifying experts and potential experts. Our results over several
   popular CQA datasets indicate that experts differ considerably from
   ordinary users in their selection preferences; enabling us to predict
   experts with higher accuracy over several baseline models. We show that
   selection preferences can be combined with baseline measures to improve
   the predictive performance even further.}},

Title = {{Device model for electronic processes at organic/organic interfaces}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{111}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{MAY 1}},
Abstract = {{Interfaces between different organic materials can play a key role in
   determining organic semiconductor device characteristics. Here, we
   present a physics-based one-dimensional model with the goal of exploring
   critical processes at organic/organic interfaces. Specifically, we
   envision a simple bilayer structure consisting of an electron transport
   layer (ETL), a hole transport layer (HTL), and the interface between
   them. The model calculations focus on the following aspects: (1) the
   microscopic physical processes at the interface, such as exciton
   formation/dissociation, exciplex formation/dissociation, and
   geminate/nongeminate recombination; (2) the treatment of the interface
   parameters and the discretization method; and (3) the application of
   this model to different devices, such as organic light emitting diodes
   and photovoltaic cells. At the interface, an electron on an ETL molecule
   can interact with a hole on an adjacent HTL molecule and form an
   intermolecular excited state (exciplex). If either the electron or the
   hole transfers across the interface, an exciton can be formed. The
   exciton may subsequently diffuse into the relevant layer and relax to
   the ground state. A strong effective electric field at the interface can
   cause excitons or exciplexes to dissociate into electrons in the ETL and
   holes in the HTL. Geminate recombination may occur when the Coulomb
   interaction between the electron and the hole generated at the interface
   by exciton dissociation causes the formation of a correlated state that
   then relaxes to the ground state. The relative impacts of the different
   processes on measurable macroscopic device characteristics are explored
   in our calculations by varying the corresponding kinetic coefficients.
   As it is the aim of this work to investigate effects associated with the
   organic/organic interface, its treatment in the numerical calculations
   is of critical importance. We model the interface as a continuous but
   rather sharp transition from the ETL to the HTL. The model is applied to
   different devices where different microscopic processes dominate. We
   discuss the results for an organic light emitting device with exciton or
   exciplex emission and for a photovoltaic device with or without geminate
   recombination. In the examples, C-60 and tetracene parameters are used
   for the ETL and HTL materials, respectively. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{We have previously used cryo-electron tomography combined with
   sub-volume averaging and classification to obtain 3D structures of
   macromolecular assemblies in cases where a single dominant species was
   present, and applied these methods to the analysis of a variety of
   trimeric HIV-1 and Sly envelope glycoproteins (Env). Here, we extend
   these studies by demonstrating automated, iterative, missing
   wedge-corrected 3D image alignment and classification methods to
   distinguish multiple conformations that are present simultaneously. We
   present a method for measuring the spatial distribution of the vector
   elements representing distinct conformational states of Env. We identify
   data processing strategies that allow clear separation of the previously
   characterized closed and open conformations, as well as unliganded and
   antibody-liganded states of Env when they are present in mixtures. We
   show that identifying and removing spikes with the lowest
   signal-to-noise ratios improves the overall accuracy of alignment
   between individual Env sub-volumes, and that alignment accuracy, in
   turn, determines the success of image classification in assessing
   conformational heterogeneity in heterogeneous mixtures. We validate
   these procedures for computational separation by successfully separating
   and reconstructing distinct 3D structures for unliganded and
   antibody-liganded as well as open and closed conformations of Env

Abstract = {{A general framework for solving image inverse problems with piecewise
   linear estimations is introduced in this paper. The approach is based on
   Gaussian mixture models, which are estimated via a maximum a posteriori
   expectation-maximization algorithm. A dual mathematical interpretation
   of the proposed framework with a structured sparse estimation is
   described, which shows that the resulting piecewise linear estimate
   stabilizes the estimation when compared with traditional sparse inverse
   problem techniques. We demonstrate that, in a number of image inverse
   problems, including interpolation, zooming, and deblurring of narrow
   kernels, the same simple and computationally efficient algorithm yields
   results in the same ballpark as that of the state of the art.}},

Abstract = {{Insertional mutagenesis screens in mice are used to identify individual
   genes that drive tumor formation. In these screens, candidate cancer
   genes are identified if their genomic location is proximal to a common
   insertion site (CIS) defined by high rates of transposon or retroviral
   insertions in a given genomic window. In this article, we describe a new
   method for defining CISs based on a Poisson distribution, the Poisson
   Regression Insertion Model, and show that this new method is an
   improvement over previously described methods. We also describe a
   modification of the method that can identify pairs and higher orders of
   co-occurring common insertion sites. We apply these methods to two data
   sets, one generated in a transposon-based screen for gastrointestinal
   tract cancer genes and another based on the set of retroviral insertions
   in the Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database. We show that the new
   methods identify more relevant candidate genes and candidate gene pairs
   than found using previous methods. Identification of the biologically
   relevant set of mutations that occur in a single cell and cause tumor
   progression will aid in the rational design of single and combinatorial
   therapies in the upcoming age of personalized cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a new geometric robot-routing problem which arises in
   data-muling applications where a mobile robot is charged with collecting
   data from stationary sensors. The objective is to compute the robot's
   trajectory and download sequence so as to minimize the time to collect
   data from all of the sensors. The total data collection time has two
   components: the robot's travel time and the download time. The time to
   download data from a sensor s is a function of the location of the robot
   and s: if the robot is a distance r(in) away from s, it can download the
   sensor's data in T-in units of time. If the distance is greater than
   r(in) but less than r(out), the download time is T-out > T-in.
   Otherwise, the robot can not download the data from s. Here, r(in),
   r(out), T-in and T-out are input parameters. We refer to this model,
   which is based on recently developed experimental models for sensor
   network deployments, as the two-ring model, and the problem of
   downloading data from a given set of sensors in minimum amount of time
   under this model as the two-ring tour (TRT) problem.
   We present approximation algorithms for the general case which uses
   solutions to the traveling salesperson with neighborhoods (TSPN) Problem
   as subroutines. We also present efficient solutions to special, but
   practically important versions of the problem such as grid-based and
   sparse deployments. The approach is validated in outdoor experiments.}},

   waterways}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{40}},
Pages = {{23-36}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{We develop a numerical model capable of simulating three-dimensional,
   turbulent free surface flows in natural waterways. Free surface motion
   is captured by coupling the two-phase level set method and the
   sharp-interface curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method of Kang et
   al. {[}1]. The model solves the three-dimensional, incompressible,
   unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and continuity equations
   in generalized curvilinear coordinates using a fractional step method
   extended to handle multiphase flows. Turbulence is modeled by a
   two-equation RANS model implemented in the context of the CURVIB method.
   The accuracy of the level set method is verified by applying it to
   simulate two- and three-dimensional sloshing problems, and the potential
   of the model for simulating real life, turbulent free surface flows is
   demonstrated by applying it to carry out RANS simulation of flow past
   rock structures in a laboratory flume and flow in a field scale
   meandering channel. The simulations show that the method is able to
   accurately predict water surface elevation over complex hydraulic
   structures and bathymetry, and capture the transition between
   subcritical and supercritical flows without any special treatment. (C)

Abstract = {{Wind turbines operate in the surface layer of the atmospheric boundary
   layer, where they are subjected to strong wind shear and relatively high
   turbulence levels. These incoming boundary layer flow characteristics
   are expected to affect the structure of wind turbine wakes. The
   near-wake region is characterized by a complex coupled vortex system
   (including helicoidal tip vortices), unsteadiness and strong turbulence
   heterogeneity. Limited information about the spatial distribution of
   turbulence in the near wake, the vortex behavior and their influence on
   the downwind development of the far wake hinders our capability to
   predict wind turbine power production and fatigue loads in wind farms.
   This calls for a better understanding of the spatial distribution of the
   3D flow and coherent turbulence structures in the near wake. Systematic
   wind-tunnel experiments were designed and carried out to characterize
   the structure of the near-wake flow downwind of a model wind turbine
   placed in a neutral boundary layer flow. A horizontal-axis, three-blade
   wind turbine model, with a rotor diameter of 13 cm and the hub height at
   10.5 cm, occupied the lowest one-third of the boundary layer.
   High-resolution particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure
   velocities in multiple vertical stream-wise planes (x-z) and vertical
   span-wise planes (y-z). In particular, we identified localized regions
   of strong vorticity and swirling strength, which are the signature of
   helicoidal tip vortices. These vortices are most pronounced at the
   top-tip level and persist up to a distance of two to three rotor
   diameters downwind. The measurements also reveal strong flow rotation
   and a highly non-axisymmetric distribution of the mean flow and
   turbulence structure in the near wake. The results provide new insight
   into the physical mechanisms that govern the development of the near
   wake of a wind turbine immersed in a neutral boundary layer. They also
   serve as important data for the development and validation of numerical
   models.}},

Abstract = {{l The perfusion contribution to the total functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) signal was investigated using a rat model with mild
   hypercapnia at 9.4 T, and human subjects with visual stimulation at 4 T.
   It was found that the total fMRI signal change could be approximated as
   a linear superposition of `true' blood oxygenation level-dependent
   (BOLD; T-2/T-2{*} effect and the blood flow-related (T-1) effect. The
   latter effect was significantly enhanced by using short repetition time
   and large radiofrequency pulse flip angle and became comparable to the
   `true' BOLD signal in response to a mild hypercapnia in the rat brain,
   resulting in an improved contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Bipolar
   diffusion gradients suppressed the intravascular signals but had no
   significant effect on the flow-related signal. Similar results of
   enhanced fMRI signal were observed in the human study. The overall
   results suggest that the observed flow-related signal enhancement is
   likely originated from perfusion, and this enhancement can improve CNR
   and the spatial specificity for mapping brain activity and physiology
   changes. The nature of mixed BOLD and perfusion-related contributions in
   the total fMRI signal also has implication on BOLD quantification, in
   particular, the BOLD calibration model commonly used to estimate the
   change of cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen. Journal of Cerebral Blood

Title = {{Estimating future global per capita water availability based on changes
   in climate and population}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS \& GEOSCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{42}},
Pages = {{79-86}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Human populations are profoundly affected by water stress, or the lack
   of sufficient per capita available freshwater. Water stress can result
   from overuse of available freshwater resources or from a reduction in
   the amount of available water due to decreases in rainfall and stored
   water supplies. Analyzing the interrelationship between human
   populations and water availability is complicated by the uncertainties
   associated with climate change projections and population projections.
   We present a simple methodology developed to integrate disparate climate
   and population data sources and develop first-order per capita water
   availability projections at the global scale. Simulations from the
   coupled land-ocean-atmosphere Community Climate System Model version 3
   (CCSM3) forced with a range of hypothetical greenhouse gas emissions
   scenarios are used to project grid-based changes in precipitation minus
   evapotranspiration as proxies for changes in runoff, or fresh water
   supply. Population growth changes, according to Intergovernmental Panel
   on Climate Change (IPCC) storylines, are used as proxies for changes in
   fresh water demand by 2025, 2050 and 2100. These freshwater supply and
   demand projections are then combined to yield estimates of per capita
   water availability aggregated by watershed and political unit. Results
   suggest that important insights might be extracted from the use of the
   process developed here, notably including the identification of the
   globe's most vulnerable regions in need of more detailed analysis and
   the relative importance of population growth versus climate change in
   altering future freshwater supplies. However, these are only exemplary
   insights and, as such, could be considered hypotheses that should be
   rigorously tested with multiple climate models, multiple observational
   climate datasets, and more comprehensive population change storylines.

Abstract = {{Among 33 cytochrome P450s (CYPs) of Streptomyces avermitilis, CYP102D1
   encoded by the sav575 gene is naturally a unique and self-sufficient
   CYP. Since the native cyp102D1 gene could not be expressed well in
   Escherichia coli, its expression was attempted using codon-optimized
   synthetic DNA. The gene was successfully overexpressed and the
   recombinant CYP102D1 was functionally active, showing a Soret peak at
   450 nm in the reduced CO difference spectrum. FMN/FAD isolated from the
   reductase domain showed the same fluorescence in thin layer
   chromatography separation as the authentic standards. Characterization
   of the substrate specificity of CYP102D1 based on NADPH oxidation rate
   revealed that it catalysed the oxidation of saturated and unsaturated
   fatty acids with very good regioselectivity, similar to other CYP102A
   families depending on NADPH supply. In particular, CYP102D1 catalysed
   the rapid oxidation of myristoleic acid with a kcat/Km value of 453.4
   +/- 181.5 mu m-1.min-1. Homology models of CYP102D1 based on other
   members of the CYP102A family allowed us to alter substrate specificity
   to aromatic compounds such as daidzein. Interestingly, replacement of
   F96V/M246I in the active site increased catalytic activity for daidzein
   with a kcat/Km value of 100.9 +/- 10.4 mu m-1.min-1 (15-fold).}},

Abstract = {{Consider a multiple input-multiple output (MIMO) interference channel
   where each transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas.
   An effective approach to practically achieving high system throughput is
   to deploy linear transceivers (or beamformers) that can optimally
   exploit the spatial characteristics of the channel. The recent work of
   Cadambe and Jafar (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, vol. 54, no. 8) suggests
   that optimal beamformers should maximize the total degrees of freedom
   and achieve interference alignment in the high signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) regime. In this paper we first consider the interference alignment
   problem without channel extension and prove that the problem of
   maximizing the total achieved degrees of freedom for a given MIMO
   interference channel is NP-hard. Furthermore, we show that even checking
   the achievability of a given tuple of degrees of freedom for all
   receivers is NP-hard when each receiver is equipped with at least three
   antennas. Interestingly, the same problem becomes polynomial time
   solvable when each transmit/receive node is equipped with no more than
   two antennas. We also propose a distributed algorithm for transmit
   covariance matrix design that does not require the DoF tuple
   preassignment, under the assumption that each receiver uses a linear
   minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamformer. The simulation results show
   that the proposed algorithm outperforms the existing interference
   alignment algorithms in terms of system throughput.}},

   exhibit a saturation magnetization up to 2.68T at room temperature,

Abstract = {{Bit patterned media recording (BPMR) is a candidate technology proposed
   to extend the areal density growth capability of magnetic recording
   systems. In conventional granular magnetic recording (CGMR), bits of
   information are recorded onto a number of randomly distributed magnetic
   grains. The difficulty for the granular media approach is that due to
   the randomness of the grains, a certain minimum number of grains are
   required in order to maintain the media signal to noise ratio (SNR).
   This requires smaller grains as the bits are shrunk and we end up with
   either unstable, or unwriteable grains as per the well-known
   media-trilemma. In BPMR, instead of random positions, the ``grains{''}
   are ordered into a well-defined lattice of magnetic islands. Because of
   this ordering, the media SNR is no longer determined by the number of
   grains per bit as in CGMR, but is defined by the geometrical and
   magnetic distributions of the fabrication process of the media.
   Analytical models exist for BPMR, that flip grains in the media based on
   the switching field distribution (SFD) and the knowledge of the applied
   head field. On the other side, a statistical model for CGMR has been
   proposed that measures probabilities of grains flipping based on
   micromagnetic simulations, named the grain flipping probability (GFP)
   model. In this work, we adapt the GFP model for BPMR and perform a
   comparison between densities predicted via the analytical and GFP

Title = {{Scaling of Static Fracture of Quasi-Brittle Structures: Strength,
   Lifetime, and Fracture Kinetics}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED MECHANICS-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{79}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The paper reviews a recently developed finite chain model for the
   weakest-link statistics of strength, lifetime, and size effect of
   quasi-brittle structures, which are the structures in which the fracture
   process zone size is not negligible compared to the cross section size.
   The theory is based on the recognition that the failure probability is
   simple and clear only on the nanoscale since the probability and
   frequency of interatomic bond failures must be equal. The paper outlines
   how a small set of relatively plausible hypotheses about the failure
   probability tail at nanoscale and its transition from nano- to
   macroscale makes it possible to derive the distribution of structural
   strength, the static crack growth rate, and the lifetime distribution,
   including the size and geometry effects {[}while an extension to fatigue
   crack growth rate and lifetime, published elsewhere (Le and Bazcant,
   2011, ``Unified Nano-Mechanics Based Probabilistic Theory of
   Quasibrittle and Brittle Structures: II. Fatigue Crack Growth, Lifetime
   and Scaling,{''} J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 1322-1337), is left aside]. A
   salient practical aspect of the theory is that for quasi-brittle
   structures the chain model underlying the weakest-link statistics must
   be considered to have a finite number of links, which implies a major
   deviation from the Weibull distribution. Several new extensions of the
   theory are presented: (1) A derivation of the dependence of static crack
   growth rate on the structure size and geometry, (2) an approximate
   closed-form solution of the structural strength distribution, and (3) an
   effective method to determine the cumulative distribution functions
   (cdf's) of structural strength and lifetime based on the mean size
   effect curve. Finally, as an example, a probabilistic reassessment of
   the 1959 Malpasset Dam failure is demonstrated. {[}DOI:

Abstract = {{Despite the essential role of the brain energy generated from ATP
   hydrolysis in supporting cortical neuronal activity and brain function,
   it is challenging to noninvasively image and directly quantify the
   energy expenditure in the human brain. In this study, we applied an
   advanced in vivo P-31 MRS imaging approach to obtain regional cerebral
   metabolic rates of high-energy phosphate reactions catalyzed by ATPase
   (CMRATPase) and creatine kinase (CMRCK), and to determine CMRATPase and
   CMRCK in pure gray mater (GM) and white mater (WM), respectively. It was
   found that both ATPase and CK rates are three times higher in GM than
   WM; and CMRCK is seven times higher than CMRATPase, in GM and WM. Among
   the total brain ATP consumption in the human cortical GM and WM, 77\% of
   them are used by GM in which approximately 96\% is by neurons. A single
   cortical neuron utilizes approximately 4.7 billion ATPs per second in a
   resting human brain. This study demonstrates the unique utility of in
   vivo P-31 MRS imaging modality for direct imaging of brain energy
   generated from ATP hydrolysis, and provides new insights into the human
   brain energetics and its role in supporting neuronal activity and brain

Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{2408-2421}},

Abstract = {{Sparsity in the eigenvectors of signal covariance matrices is exploited
   in this paper for compression and denoising. Dimensionality reduction
   (DR) and quantization modules present in many practical compression
   schemes such as transform codecs, are designed to capitalize on this
   form of sparsity and achieve improved reconstruction performance
   compared to existing sparsity-agnostic codecs. Using training data that
   may be noisy a novel sparsity-aware linear DR scheme is developed to
   fully exploit sparsity in the covariance eigenvectors and form
   noise-resilient estimates of the principal covariance eigenbasis.
   Sparsity is effected via norm-one regularization, and the associated
   minimization problems are solved using computationally efficient
   coordinate descent iterations. The resulting eigenspace estimator is
   shown capable of identifying a subset of the unknown support of the
   eigenspace basis vectors even when the observation noise covariance
   matrix is unknown, as long as the noise power is sufficiently low. It is
   proved that the sparsity-aware estimator is asymptotically normal, and
   the probability to correctly identify the signal subspace basis support
   approaches one, as the number of training data grows large. Simulations
   using synthetic data and images, corroborate that the proposed
   algorithms achieve improved reconstruction quality relative to
   alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{Joint design of flow control, multipath routing, and random access
   control is considered for wireless multihop networks. Based on a network
   utility maximization formulation, Aloha persistence probabilities are
   optimized together with multicommodity end-to-end rates and per-link
   flow rates. Although the joint optimization of Aloha and flow control
   was previously tackled using a convex reformulation, adding the routing
   component renders the problem inherently nonconvex. To cope with this
   challenge, a successive convex approximation approach is taken to obtain
   a locally optimal solution efficiently. A parallelized distributed
   algorithm is developed, which scales well in the network size and
   exhibits low computational complexity. An online implementation is also
   proposed and tested. Numerical examples verify the novel design and
   highlight the performance advantage over state-of-the-art alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{The computation of some entries of a matrix inverse arises in several
   important applications in practice. This paper presents a probing method
   for determining the diagonal of the inverse of a sparse matrix in the
   common situation when its inverse exhibits a decay property, i.e. when
   many of the entries of the inverse are small. A few simple properties of

Abstract = {{In this paper, hemicelluloses from bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens
   Mazel) stem aged six months were sequentially extracted with hot water,
   2\% KOH, and 5\% NaOH. The water-soluble hemicelluloses HI, and four
   alkali-soluble hemicellulosic fractions H-2, H-3, H-4 and H-5 were
   obtained, achieving a total yield of 59.60\% based on the original
   hemicelluloses. Sugar composition analysis showed that the
   hemicelluloses were mainly composed of xylose (44.39-72.71\%), arabinose
   (26.36-51.87\%), ribose (0.93-2.72\%), and uronic acid (0.29-5.27\%).
   The structures of the hemicelluloses were determined to be mainly
   arabinoxylan, using the FT-IR and NMR techniques. The AFM images of
   fraction H-3 revealed a distribution of spherical nanoparticles with
   different sizes, while the fraction H-2 had helix rod and random coil
   feature. The SEM characterizations indicated that the fraction H-1
   displayed spherical particles while the fraction H-3 had mainly flat
   particles at high magnification. Thermal stability was also analyzed
   using TG-DTG method and first-order kinetics model. (c) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This survey attempts to provide a comprehensive and structured overview
   of the existing research for the problem of detecting anomalies in
   discrete/symbolic sequences. The objective is to provide a global
   understanding of the sequence anomaly detection problem and how existing
   techniques relate to each other. The key contribution of this survey is
   the classification of the existing research into three distinct
   categories, based on the problem formulation that they are trying to
   solve. These problem formulations are: 1) identifying anomalous
   sequences with respect to a database of normal sequences; 2) identifying
   an anomalous subsequence within a long sequence; and 3) identifying a
   pattern in a sequence whose frequency of occurrence is anomalous. We
   show how each of these problem formulations is characteristically
   distinct from each other and discuss their relevance in various
   application domains. We review techniques from many disparate and
   disconnected application domains that address each of these
   formulations. Within each problem formulation, we group techniques into
   categories based on the nature of the underlying algorithm. For each
   category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique, and show how
   the existing techniques are variants of the basic technique. This
   approach shows how different techniques within a category are related or
   different from each other. Our categorization reveals new variants and
   combinations that have not been investigated before for anomaly
   detection. We also provide a discussion of relative strengths and
   weaknesses of different techniques. We show how techniques developed for
   one problem formulation can be adapted to solve a different formulation,
   thereby providing several novel adaptations to solve the different
   problem formulations. We also highlight the applicability of the
   techniques that handle discrete sequences to other related areas such as
   online anomaly detection and time series anomaly detection.}},

Abstract = {{Cofactor analogs promise important applications in biosynthesis. The
   effect of chemical modification on the reactivity of NADH for redox
   reactions catalyzed by dehydrogenases was examined in this work.
   Compared with the native NADH, kinetics and molecular docking studies
   with 8-(6-aminohexyl)-amino-NADH showed that its binding with alcohol
   dehydrogenase (ADH) was not much affected or even enhanced by a factor
   of 4.9-fold with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), but complicated the
   binding of substrates to the enzymes. For ADH, the Michaelis constant
   for acetaldehyde decreased from 0.47 to 0.048 mM, while that of sodium
   pyruvate with LDH increased to 0.81 from 0.18 mM. On the other hand, the
   modified coenzyme showed a 19.3-fold decrease in turnover number
   (k(cat)) with ADH, while a slight increase with LDH. Molecular docking
   analysis showed that the hexanediamine arm on the modified coenzyme
   generated an extra hydrogen bond at the active site of ADH, as well as
   additional hydrophobic interactions with both ADH and LDH. It appeared
   that the apparently decreased reactivity of modified cofactor with ADH
   was caused mainly by the enhanced stability of ternary
   coenzyme-enzyme-substrate complex, while in the case of LDH, the reduced
   substrate binding as a result of the chemical modification of NADH led
   to a slight increase in the overall reaction reactivity. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Isomerization reactions starting with dihydroxyacetone (DHA), xylose,
   and glucose in water were catalyzed by Sn-MFI and Sn-BEA zeolites.
   Sn-SEA was more active than Sn-MFI for glucose, while both catalysts
   were able to isomerize dihydroxyacetone and xylose. After 210 min at 90
   degrees C, the yields of lactic acid, xylulose, and fructose using

   surface area all contribute to the strong activity of Sn-SEA for all

Abstract = {{DNA vaccination using cationic polymers as carriers has the potential to
   be a very powerful method of immunotherapy, but typical immune responses
   generated have been less than robust. To better understand the details
   of DNA vaccine delivery in vivo, we prepared polymer/DNA complexes using
   three structurally distinct cationic polymers and fluorescently labeled
   plasmid DNA and injected them intradermally into mice. We analyzed
   transgene expression (luciferase) and the local tissue distribution of
   the labeled plasmid at the injection site at various time points (from
   hours to days). Comparable numbers of luciferase expressing cells were
   observed in the skin of mice receiving naked plasmid or polyplexes one
   day after transfection. At day 4, however, the polyplexes appeared to
   result in more transfected skin cells than naked plasmid. Live animal
   imaging revealed that naked plasmid dispersed quickly in the skin of
   mice after injection and had a wider distribution than any of the three
   types of polyplexes. However, naked plasmid level dropped to below
   detection limit after 24 h, whereas polyplexes persisted for up to 2
   weeks. The PEGylated polyplexes had a significantly wider distribution
   in the tissue than the nonPEGylated polyplexes. PEGylated polyplexes
   also distributed more broadly among dermal fibroblasts and allowed
   greater interaction with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) (dendritic
   cells and macrophages) starting at around 24 h post-injection. By day 4,
   co-localization of polyplexes with APCs was observed at the injection
   site regardless of polymer structure, whereas small amounts of
   polyplexes were found in the draining lymph nodes. These in vivo
   findings demonstrate the superior stability of PEGylated polyplexes in
   physiological milieu and provide important insight on how cationic
   polymers could be optimized for DNA vaccine delivery. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{A fully evolved metabolic network can be described as a weighted sum of
   elementary modes where the usage probabilities of modes are distributed
   according to the Boltzmann distribution law (Srienc and Unrean, 2010).
   An organism presumably achieves the fully evolved state through adaptive
   changes in the kinetics of rate-controlling enzymes. Metabolic control
   analysis identifies reactions catalyzed by such enzymes. Comparison of
   the experimentally determined metabolic flux distributions of
   Thermoanaerobacterium saccharolyticum AS411 with the predicted flux
   distribution of a fully evolved metabolic network identified
   phosphoglucose isomerase (PGI) as the enzyme with the greatest flux
   control, the rate-controlling enzyme. The analysis predicts that an
   increased activity of PGI would enable the metabolic network to approach
   the fully evolved state and result in a faster specific growth rate. The
   prediction was confirmed by experimental results that showed an
   increased specific activity of PGI in a culture of strain AS411 that
   adaptively evolved over 280 generations. Sequencing of the gene
   confirmed the occurrence of a group of mutations clustered in the
   subunit binding domain of the dimeric enzyme. The results indicate that
   the evolutionary path is predictable as the strain AS411 adapted toward
   the fully evolved state by increasing the PGI activity. This
   experimental finding confirms that enzymes with predicted highest
   metabolic flux control are the targets of adaptive metabolic pathway
   evolution. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Small-angle neutron scattering study of magnetic ordering and

   Ni50-xCoxMn40Sn10 alloys}},

Abstract = {{The Heusler-derived multiferroic alloy Ni50-xCoxMn40Sn10 has recently
   been shown to exhibit, at just above room temperature, a highly
   reversible martensitic phase transformation with an unusually large
   magnetization change. In this work the nature of the magnetic ordering
   above and below this transformation has been studied in detail in the
   critical composition range x = 6-8 via temperature-dependent (5-600 K)
   magnetometry and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). We observe
   fairly typical paramagnetic to long-range-ordered ferromagnetic phase
   transitions on cooling to 420-430 K, with the expected critical spin
   fluctuations, followed by first-order martensitic phase transformations
   to a nonferromagnetic state below 360-390 K. The static magnetization
   reveals complex magnetism in this low-temperature nonferromagnetic
   phase, including a Langevin-like field dependence, distinct spin
   freezing near 60 K, and significant exchange bias effects, consistent
   with superparamagnetic blocking of ferromagnetic clusters of nanoscopic
   dimensions. We demonstrate that these spin clusters, whose existence has
   been hypothesized in a variety of martensitic alloys exhibiting
   competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic exchange
   interactions, can be directly observed by SANS. The scattering data are
   consistent with a liquidlike spatial distribution of interacting
   magnetic clusters with a mean center-to-center spacing of 12 nm.
   Considering the behavior of the superparmagnetism, cooling-field and
   temperature-dependent exchange bias, and magnetic SANS, we discuss in
   detail the physical form and origin of these spin clusters, their
   intercluster interactions, the nature of the ground-state magnetic
   ordering in the martensitic phase, and the implications for our
   understanding of such alloy systems.}},

Volume = {{53}},
Number = {{10}},
Pages = {{1992-2000}},

Abstract = {{We reported that well-defined polymer brushes could be prepared
   efficiently via the grafting-onto approach and the polymer brushes
   grafted with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), poly(epsilon-caprolactone)
   (PCL) and mixed PEO/PCL have been obtained. Firstly, poly(glycidyl
   methacrylate)s, PG(100) and PG(940), were prepared by controlled radical
   polymerization and their epoxy groups were reacted with sodium azide to
   introduce azido groups quantitatively. Then the PG derivatives bearing
   azido groups, poly(3-azido-2-hydroxypropyl methacrylate)(100)
   (PGA(100)), were reacted with the alkynyl terminated either PEO
   (ay-PEO113) or PCL (ay-PCL17) through copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne
   cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction under mild temperature. At a molar feed
   ratio of ay-PEO113:azido unit = 1:1, the coupling reaction with
   ay-PEO113 proceeded nearly quantitatively. At the same feed, the
   conversion of grafting ay-PCL17 dropped to ca. 80\%. Amphiphilic polymer
   brushes with randomly grafted PEO and PCL branches were also obtained by
   feeding the mixed ay-PEO and ay-PCL during CuAAC. By coupling ay-PEO113
   onto a long backbone PGA(940), wormlike PEO brushes with an average
   length of 140 nm were prepared as demonstrated by AFM. This molecular
   worm was further labeled with Rhodamine B and then was incubated with
   liver cancer cells HepG2. Preliminary results indicated that the
   wormlike brushes could be internalized by the cells easily, suggesting
   the potential application as advanced vehicles for delivery. (C) 2012

Title = {{A sub-grid scale closure for nonlinear hillslope sediment transport
   models}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{APR 24}},
Abstract = {{Hillslope sediment transport models express the sediment flux at a point
   as a function of some topographic attributes of the system, such as
   slope, curvature, soil thickness, etc., at that point only (referred
   here as ``local{''} transport models) or at an appropriately defined
   vicinity of that point (referred here as ``nonlocal{''} transport
   models). Typically, topographic attributes are computed from digital
   elevation data (DEMs) and thus their estimates depend on the DEM
   resolution (1 m, 10 m, 90 m, etc.) rendering any sediment flux
   computation scale-dependent. Often calibration compensates for this
   scale-dependence resulting in effective parameterizations with limited
   physical meaning. In this paper, we demonstrate the scale-dependence of
   local nonlinear hillslope sediment flux models and derive a subgrid
   scale closure via upscaling. We parameterize the subgrid scale closure
   in terms of the low resolution, resolved topographic attributes of the
   landscape, thus allowing the reliable computation of a scale-independent
   sediment flux from low resolution digital elevation data. We also show
   that the accuracy of the derived subgrid scale closure model depends on
   the dimensionless erosion rate and the dimensionless relief of any given
   basin. Finally, we present theoretical arguments and demonstrate that
   the recently proposed nonlocal sediment flux models are
   scale-independent. These concepts are demonstrated via an application on
   a small basin (MR1) of the central Oregon Coast Range using
   high-resolution lidar topographic data.}},

Abstract = {{We describe the LCST-type phase behavior of poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)
   dissolved in imidazolium-based tetrafluoroborate ionic liquids (ILs).
   Phase diagrams were determined by a combination of small-angle neutron
   scattering (SANS) and cloud point (CP) measurements. Unlike typical LCST
   phase diagrams of polymer solutions, the PEO/IL phase diagram is either
   roughly symmetric with a critical composition near 50\% polymer or
   asymmetric with a critical composition shifted to an even higher
   concentration of PEO. As the molecular weight decreases from 20 500 to
   4200 g/mol, the critical temperature (T-c) increases slightly (,similar
   to 10 degrees C). However, a larger increase in T-c (27 degrees C) was
   observed as the molecular weight decreases from 4200 to 2100 g/mol,
   likely due to the increasing importance of hydrogen bonds between the
   -OH end groups of PEO and the fluorine atoms of the anions. This
   inference is supported by the strong dependence of the phase diagram on
   the identity of the PEO end groups (hydroxy vs methoxy). Furthermore,
   replacing the most acidic proton of the imidazolium ring (in the C-2
   position) with a methyl group lowers the T-c, and changes the shape of
   the phase diagram significantly, suggesting that the hydrogen bonds
   between the H atoms on the C-2 position of the imidazolium ring and the
   O atoms of PEO play an important role in determining the LCST phase
   behavior of this system.}},

   organic light-emitting devices (AMOLEDs) by printed organic thin-film

   by extremely small transistor dimensions with respect to the OLED active
   area. A maximum brightness of similar to 900 cd m-2 is achieved at diode
   supply voltages near 4 V and pixel selector (gate) voltages below 1 V.
   The ratio of OLED to OET area is greater than 100:1 and the pixels may
   be switched at rates up to 100 Hz. Essential to this demonstration are
   the use of a high capacitance electrolyte as the gate dielectric layer
   in the OETs, which affords extremely large transistor transconductances,
   and novel graded emissive layer (G-EML) OLED architectures that exhibit
   low turn-on voltages and high luminescence efficiency. Collectively,

Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{APR 21}},
Abstract = {{Downscaling of remotely sensed precipitation images and outputs of
   general circulation models has been a subject of intense interest in
   hydrometeorology. The problem of downscaling is basically one of
   resolution enhancement, that is, appropriately adding details or high
   frequency features onto a low-resolution observation or simulated
   rainfall field. Invoking the property of rainfall self similarity, this
   mathematically ill-posed problem has been approached in the past within
   a stochastic framework resulting in ensemble of possible high-resolution
   realizations. In this work, we recast the rainfall downscaling into an
   ill-posed inverse problem and introduce a class of nonlinear estimators
   to properly regularize it and obtain the best high-resolution estimate
   in an optimal sense. This regularization capitalizes on two main
   observations: (1) precipitation fields are sparse when transformed into
   an appropriately chosen domain (e. g., wavelet), and (2) small-scale
   organized precipitation features tend to recur within and across
   different storm environments. We demonstrate the promise of the proposed
   methodology through downscaling and error analysis of level III
   precipitation reflectivity snapshots provided by the ground-based next
   generation Doppler weather radars in a ground validation sites of the
   Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the alternative of precombustion capture of
   carbon dioxide from integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) plants
   using membrane reactors equipped with H-2-selective zeolite membranes
   for the water gas shift reaction. Specifically, a one-dimensional and
   isothermal membrane reactor model is developed. This model is used for
   simulation and optimization studies considering cocurrent and
   countercurrent modes of reactor operation. The simulation results
   indicate successful countercurrent cases that satisfy all of the
   specified targets and constraints. With use of this developed model, a
   novel optimization problem is formulated and solved to guide the
   selection of the optimal reactor design among typical scenarios of
   operation. The optimization results suggest as optimal solution a
   reactor design with a preshift followed by a membrane reactor. The
   obtained optimal design enables a more efficient membrane use by placing
   it in the optimal location. This design also results in savings of as
   high as 25\% (in the range of 10-25\%) in terms of membrane material
   when compared to the original membrane reactor design. For the price
   range of zeolite membranes considered on the order of \$1000-10 000/m(2)
   and for large-scale applications, in which the membrane surface areas
   are on the order of 2000 m(2), 25\% of savings implies cost reductions
   on the order of millions of dollars (as high as \$5 000 000 in this
   case).}},

Abstract = {{Six conserved, charged amino acids within membrane spans in rice sucrose

   only a small fraction of sucrose uptake activity (2.3\% of that of the
   wild type), and R335H and E336Q also displayed a substantial decrease in
   transport activity. D329N functioned as well as wild-type OsSUT1. R188K
   did not transport sucrose but showed a H+ leak that was inhibited by
   sucrose, indicating that R188K had uncoupled sucrose and H+
   translocation. This demonstrates that charged amino acids within

Abstract = {{Microtubules undergo alternating periods of growth and shortening, known
   as dynamic instability. These dynamics allow microtubule plus ends to
   explore cellular space. The ``search and capture{''} model posits that
   selective anchoring of microtubule plus ends at the cell cortex may
   contribute to cell polarization, spindle orientation, or targeted
   trafficking to specific cellular domains {[}1-3]. Whereas cytoplasmic
   dynein is primarily known as a minus-end-directed microtubule motor for
   organelle transport, cortically localized dynein has been shown to
   capture and tether microtubules at the cell periphery in both dividing
   and interphase cells {[}3-7]. To explore the mechanism involved, we
   developed a minimal in vitro system, with dynein-bound beads positioned
   near microtubule plus ends using an optical trap. Dynein induced a
   significant reduction in the lateral diffusion of microtubule ends,
   distinct from the effects of other microtubule-associated proteins such
   as kinesin-1 and EB1. In assays with dynamic microtubules, dynein
   delayed barrier-induced catastrophe of microtubules. This effect was ATP
   dependent, indicating that dynein motor activity was required.
   Computational modeling suggests that dynein delays catastrophe by
   exerting tension on individual protofilaments, leading to microtubule
   stabilization. Thus, dynein-mediated capture and tethering of
   microtubules at the cortex can lead to enhanced stability of dynamic
   plus ends.}},

   stratigraphic record: Experiments and theory}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{117}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{Stratigraphy preserved in alluvial basins holds important information
   for reconstructing past environmental conditions via inversion
   methodologies. In this paper we explore, through the use of physical and
   numerical experiments, the forward problem, that is, we quantify how the
   probabilistic structure of the processes that govern the evolution of
   depositional systems relates to the probability distribution of the
   preserved bed thicknesses. We demonstrate that the extreme variability,
   as evidenced by heavy-tailed distribution of the surface elevation
   increments, largely cancels itself out in the resulting stratigraphy.
   Specifically, we show that bed thickness is well described by an
   exponential distribution even when erosional and depositional increments
   characterizing the surface evolution exhibit heavy-tailed statistics,
   i.e., large, infrequent events have a significant chance of occurrence.
   We attribute this finding to the symmetric nature of the distribution of
   elevation increments (both erosional and depositional events) and the
   additive nature of the stratigraphic filter. We also show that the
   variability of surface elevation increments, as measured by the
   interquartile range of their probability distribution, has a robust and
   well-defined relationship with the preserved mean bed thickness.}},

Abstract = {{Previous studies on the life-cycle environmental impacts of corn ethanol
   and gasoline focused almost exclusively on energy balance and greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions and largely overlooked the influence of regional
   differences in agricultural practices. This study compares the
   environmental impact of gasoline and E85 taking into consideration 12
   different environmental impacts and regional differences among 19
   corn-growing states. Results show that E85 does not outperform gasoline
   when a wide spectrum of impacts is considered. If the impacts are
   aggregated using weights developed by the National Institute of
   Standards and Technology (NIST), overall, E85 generates approximately
   6\% to 108\% (23\% on average) greater impact compared with gasoline,
   depending on where corn is produced, primarily because corn production
   induces significant eutrophication impacts and requires intensive
   irrigation. If GHG emissions from the indirect land use changes are
   considered, the differences increase to between 16\% and 118\% (33\% on
   average). Our study indicates that replacing gasoline with corn ethanol
   may only result in shifting the net environmental impacts primarily
   toward increased eutrophication and greater water scarcity. These
   results suggest that the environmental criteria used in the Energy
   Independence and Security Act (EISA) be re-evaluated to include
   additional categories of environmental impact beyond GHG emissions.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive operations engage neural generators oscillating at different
   frequencies distributed in time and space. Accordingly, oscillatory
   activity detected by magnetoencephalography (MEG)/electroencephalography
   (EEG) should be analyzed along frequency, time, and spatial dimensions.
   MEG data were obtained from 19 healthy individuals while performing a
   modified Sternberg paradigm. The stimuli were letters, which constituted
   words or pronounceable nonwords. We applied tridimensional analysis of
   oscillations and also computed event-related fields (ERFs) in areas
   where significant changes in oscillatory activity were observed. Verbal
   working memory for visual verbal stimuli was associated with oscillatory
   interplay between the bilateral occipital lobes and the left
   frontoparietotemporal areas. Spatially stable occipital desynchrony was
   noted during information encoding, while a left hemisphere
   desynchronization, increasing in amplitude and spatial extent over time,
   was observed during information encoding and maintenance. No ERF changes
   were detected during information maintenance. Oscillatory activity
   associated with verbal working memory is consistent with the above
   hypothesis. These findings underscore the importance of multidimensional
   evaluation of oscillations. The findings also indicate that combining
   electrophysiological methods increase the chance of signal detection.}},

Abstract = {{The treatment of anaerobically digested swine wastewater (ADSW) is
   problematic due to its high nutrient concentration. This study
   investigated the simultaneous sequestration of ammonium (N) and
   phosphate (P) from ADSW using nano-zeolites synthesized from fly ash
   (ZFA). The nanometer-scale crystalline structures plentiful of
   zeolite-NaP1 coating on ZFA particle increased the levels of specific
   surface area and cation exchange capacity at times of 40 and 104,
   compared to raw fly ash. Kinetic N and P sorption experiments with ZFA
   were well described by both the Langmuir and Freundlich models,
   suggesting the co-existence of homogeneous and heterogeneous sorption
   mechanisms. N and P removal efficiencies ranged from 41\% to 95\% and
   75\% to 98\%, respectively, across a range of ZFA doses (from 0.25 to 8
   g/100 ml). Collectively, application of the laboratory-synthesized ZFA
   can alleviate the nutrient loads in ADSW and therefore modify the ratio
   of N:P in wastewater beneficial for subsequent biological treatment.

Abstract = {{A hetero-photoautotrophic algal growth model was studied for improved
   wastewater treatment and low cost algal biofuel feedstock production.
   The microalga, Auxenochlorella protothecoides UMN280, was grown
   heterotrophically on concentrated municipal wastewater and then
   autotrophically with CO2 supplementation (air, 1\% and 5\%,
   respectively). Strain UMN280 was harvested by self-sedimentation after
   the heterotrophic stage and the supernatant was aerated with different
   levels of CO2 to facilitate autotrophic growth in the second stage. The
   maximal biomass concentration and lipid content at the first and second
   stages reached 1.12 g/L and 28.90\%, and 1.16 g/L and 33.22\%,
   respectively. The nutrient removal efficiencies for total phosphorus,
   ammonia, nitrogen and chemical oxygen demand at the end of the two-stage
   cultivation were 98.48\%, 100\%, 90.60\% and 79.10\%, respectively. The
   above process can be used to treat organic-rich wastewaters (e.g.
   industrial and animal manure wastewaters) to achieve the dual purpose of
   low-cost wastewater treatment and biofuel feedstock production. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{As technology advances, microprocessors that integrate multiple cores on
   a single chip are becoming increasingly common. How to use these
   processors to improve the performance of a single program has been a
   challenge. For general-purpose applications, it is especially difficult
   to create efficient parallel execution due to the complex control flow
   and ambiguous data dependences. Thread-level speculation and
   transactional memory provide two hardware mechanisms that are able to
   optimistically parallelize potentially dependent threads. However, a
   compiler that performs detailed performance trade-off analysis is
   essential for generating efficient parallel programs for these
   hardwares. This compiler must be able to take into consideration the
   cost of intra-thread as well as inter-thread value communication. On the
   other hand, the ubiquitous existence of complex, input-dependent control
   flow and data dependence patterns in general-purpose applications makes
   it impossible to have one technique optimize all program patterns. In
   this paper, we propose three optimization techniques to improve the
   thread performance: (i) scheduling instruction and generating recovery
   code to reduce the critical forwarding path introduced by synchronizing
   memory resident values; (ii) identifying reduction variables and
   transforming the code the minimize the serializing execution; and (iii)
   dynamically merging consecutive iterations of a loop to avoid stalls due
   to unbalanced workload. Detailed evaluation of the proposed mechanism
   shows that each optimization technique improves a subset but none
   improve all of the SPEC2000 benchmarks. On average, the proposed
   optimizations improve the performance by 7\% for the set of the SPEC2000
   benchmarks that have already been optimized for register-resident value
   communication.}},

Abstract = {{The spin torque switching behavior of perpendicular magnetic tunnel
   junctions consisting of a CoFeB free layer and a CoFeB/Ru/(Co/Pd)n
   exchanged coupled fixed layer is investigated. At first, the Ru and
   CoFeB layer thickness is tuned in the CoFeB/Ru/(Co/Pd) n structure to
   form a ferromagnetically exchange coupled structure with a strong PMA at
   an annealing treatment of 325 degrees C for 1 h. Then it is shown that
   that the CoFeB free layer thickness plays an important role in the
   switching current density. The switching current density decreases with
   the increase of the CoFeB free layer thickness. A minimum switching
   current density of 1.87 MA/cm(2) is achieved for a device with 60 nm
   diameter. The mechanism involved in the switching current reduction with
   the decrease of CoFeB free layer thickness is also studied. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this study, thin films of Fe83Ga17 (a giant magnetostrictive alloy)
   were grown on single-crystalline n-GaAs (001) and polycrystalline brass
   substrates via electrochemical synthesis from ferrous and gallium
   sulfate electrolytes. Extensive structural characterization using
   microdiffraction, high-resolution omega - 2 theta, and rocking-curve
   analysis revealed that the films grown on GaAs(001) are highly textured
   with < 001 > orientation along the substrate normal, and the texture
   improved further upon annealing at 300 degrees C for 2 h in N-2
   environment. On the contrary, films grown on brass substrates exhibited
   < 011 > preferred orientation. Rocking-curve analysis done on
   Fe83Ga17/GaAs structures further confirmed that the < 001 > texture in
   the Fe83Ga17 thin film is a result of epitaxial nucleation and growth.
   The non-linear current-voltage plot obtained for the Fe-Ga/GaAs Schottky
   contacts was characteristic of tunneling injection, and showed improved
   behavior with annealing. Thus, this study demonstrates the feasibility
   of fabricating spintronic devices that incorporate highly
   magnetostrictive Fe(1-x)Gax thin films grown epitaxially via
   electrochemistry. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In this work, magnetization reversal mechanisms in various 35 nm

   vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) equipped with vector coils, making
   it possible to monitor both x- and y-components of the sample moment
   during reversal. When reversal fields were applied in the low angular
   range (0-60 degrees), all nanowire structures, irrespective of Fe80Ga20
   or Cu aspect ratios, experienced reversal by nucleation and propagation
   of a vortex domain wall. However, when fields were applied in the high
   angular range of 60-90 degrees, reversal occurred by coherent rotation.
   Using vector-VSM, it was further shown that in structures with
   pancake-like Fe80Ga20 segments, the extent to which moments in adjacent
   segments rotate cooperatively decreased as the Cu thickness increased.

   paper, FePt based ECC bit patterned structures with 31 nm bit size and
   37 nm pitch size were fabricated using di-block copolymer lithography on
   3 inch wafer. Remanant states were tracked using magnetic force
   microscopy (MFM). DC demagnetization (DCD) curves were plotted by
   counting the reversed bits in the MFM images. Magnetic domains in which
   the magnetizations of the neighboring bits were aligned to the same
   direction were observed in the MFM patterns. Thermal decay measurement
   was performed for the samples to obtain the thermal stability and gain
   factor. The thermal barrier was found around 210 k(B)T with a gain
   factor up to 1.57 for the bit patterned structure FePt(4 nm)/Fe(4 nm).

Abstract = {{Ultrathin exchange coupled composite (ECC) FePt granular recording media
   with different soft layer anisotropy were fabricated by controlling the

   texture of ECC FePt thin films was improved, while the saturation
   magnetization (Ms) and the thermal stability factor were also increased.
   The effect of soft layer anisotropy field on the coercivity (Hc) and the
   remanent coercivity (Hcr) of ECC FePt thin films showed a ``V{''} shape
   relationship, with the minimums at T-Soft of 200 degrees C. These
   results are consistent with the theoretic predication based on domain
   wall assisted magnetization reversal mechanism. The ECC FePt thin film

   elemental mapping was that Cu atoms were rich in the inner part of
   Sm(Co, Cu)(5) grains (defined by Sm and Co concentrations), instead of
   the outer part of grains, such as grain boundaries. Cu served as an
   alloying element in Sm(Co, Cu)(5) grains, not as a doping element to
   form Cu-rich grain boundaries. A model of Sm(Co, Cu)(5) films with

Abstract = {{Three-dimensional (3D) silicon integration technologies have provided
   new opportunities for Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture design in
   Systems-on-Chip (SoCs). In this article, we consider the
   application-specific NoC architecture design problem in a 3D
   environment. We present an efficient floorplan-aware 3D NoC synthesis
   algorithm based on simulated allocation (SAL), a stochastic method for
   traffic flow routing, and accurate power and delay models for NoC
   components. We demonstrate that this method finds greatly improved
   solutions compared to a baseline algorithm reflecting prior work. To
   evaluate the SAL method, we compare its performance with the widely used
   simulated annealing (SA) method and show that SAL is much faster than SA
   for this application, while providing solutions of very similar quality.
   We then extend the approach from a single-path routing to a multipath
   routing scheme and explore the trade-off between power consumption and
   runtime for these two schemes. Finally, we study the impact of various
   factors on the network performance in 3D NoCs, including the TSV count
   and the number of 3D tiers. Our studies show that link power and delay
   can be significantly improved when moving from a 2D to a 3D
   implementation, but the improvement flattens out as the number of 3D
   tiers goes beyond a certain point.}},

Abstract = {{Crouch gait, a common walking pattern in individuals with cerebral
   palsy, is characterized by excessive flexion of the hip and knee. Many
   subjects with crouch gait experience knee pain, perhaps because of
   elevated muscle forces and joint loading. The goal of this study was to
   examine how muscle forces and compressive tibiofemoral force change with
   the increasing knee flexion associated with crouch gait. Muscle forces
   and tibiofemoral force were estimated for three unimpaired children and
   nine children with cerebral palsy who walked with varying degrees of
   knee flexion. We scaled a generic musculoskeletal model to each subject
   and used the model to estimate muscle forces and compressive
   tibiofemoral forces during walking. Mild crouch gait (minimum knee
   flexion 20-35 degrees) produced a peak compressive tibiofemoral force
   similar to unimpaired walking; however, severe crouch gait (minimum knee
   flexion > 50 degrees) increased the peak force to greater than 6 times
   body-weight, more than double the load experienced during unimpaired
   gait. This increase in compressive tibiofemoral force was primarily due
   to increases in quadriceps force during crouch gait, which increased
   quadratically with average stance phase knee flexion (i.e., crouch
   severity). Increased quadriceps force contributes to larger tibiofemoral
   and patellofemoral loading which may contribute to knee pain in
   individuals with crouch gait. (C) 2011 Elsevier BM. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a linear mathematical model of a supercavitating vehicle
   is developed to investigate some of the physical factors affecting
   stability and control. This model provides a link between the simulation
   dynamics and the assumed physical vehicle characteristics. In this
   paper, the static and dynamic stability of the pitch plane dynamics of
   the vehicle is considered and the effect of cavitator shapes, namely a
   disk cavitator, a 45 degrees cone, and a 15 degrees cone on the vehicle
   stability, is determined. All three cavitator shapes resulted in
   unstable vehicles when operating in nonplaning conditions, with the disk
   cavitator the least destabilizing. Neglecting the small tangential
   forces on the disk cavitator is confirmed to be reasonable, but in
   general, the vehicle static stability characteristics depend on the
   cavitator tangential forces. The vehicle mathematical model uses static
   experimental data of hydrodynamic coefficients for the disk cavitator.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we address the problem of estimating the intrinsic
   parameters of a 3D LIDAR while at the same time computing its extrinsic
   calibration with respect to a rigidly connected camera. Existing
   approaches to solve this nonlinear estimation problem are based on
   iterative minimization of nonlinear cost functions. In such cases, the
   accuracy of the resulting solution hinges on the availability of a
   precise initial estimate, which is often not available. In order to
   address this issue, we divide the problem into two least-squares
   sub-problems, and analytically solve each one to determine a precise
   initial estimate for the unknown parameters. We further increase the
   accuracy of these initial estimates by iteratively minimizing a batch
   nonlinear least-squares cost function. In addition, we provide the
   minimal identifiability conditions, under which it is possible to
   accurately estimate the unknown parameters. Experimental results
   consisting of photorealistic 3D reconstruction of indoor and outdoor
   scenes, as well as standard metrics of the calibration errors, are used
   to assess the validity of our approach.}},

Title = {{Bit/rock interface laws in directional drilling}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{81-90}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the formulation of global relationships between
   the forces and moments acting on a PDC drag bit and the kinematic
   variables describing the penetration of the tool into the rock. It
   considers the general situation where the bit penetration is
   characterized not only by an axial but also by lateral and angular
   components, as it is the case when drilling a deviated well with a bit
   tilted on the borehole axis. These interface laws serve as boundary
   conditions for the drillstring treated as a rod when modeling the
   propagation of the borehole. While the relationships between forces and
   penetrations assume the bit to be reduced to a point, determination of
   the parameters of the interface laws requires information about the bit
   geometry and the cutter characteristics, as well as knowledge about the
   local cutter/rock interaction. We show that it is actually possible to
   construct the interface laws by using the device of an equivalent blade,
   which embodies the properties and geometry of the bit. The use of this
   device eliminates the need to consider the interaction of each
   individual cutter with the rock during one revolution of the bit. The
   approach is illustrated for a cylindrical bit. In this case, the
   interface parameters and their dependence on the bit tilt can be
   determined in closed form. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation of 3D flow past a real-life marine hydrokinetic
   turbine}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{39}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{We simulate three-dimensional, turbulent flow past an axial-flow marine
   hydrokinetic (MHK) turbine mounted on the bed of a rectangular open
   channel by adapting a computational framework developed for carrying out
   high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) in arbitrarily complex
   domains involving moving or stationary boundaries. The complex turbine
   geometry, including the rotor and all stationary components, is handled
   by employing the curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method {[}1,2].
   Velocity boundary conditions near all solid surfaces are reconstructed
   using a wall model based on solving the simplified boundary layer
   equations {[}2]. To demonstrate the capabilities of the model we apply
   it to simulate the flow past a Gen4 axial flow MHK turbine developed by
   Verdant Power for the Roosevelt Island Tidal Energy (RITE) project in
   the East River in New York City, USA. We carry out systematic grid
   refinement studies, using grids with up to 185 million nodes, for only
   the turbine rotor placed in an infinite free stream to show that the
   computed torque converges to a grid insensitive value, which is in good
   agreement with field measurements. We also carry out LES for the
   complete turbine configuration, including the pylon, nacelle and rotor,
   mounted on the bed of a straight rectangular open channel. The computed
   results illustrate the complexity of the flow and show that the power
   output of the complete turbine is primarily dependent on the rotor
   geometry and tip speed ratio, and is not affected by the stationary
   components of the turbine and the presence of the channel bed. The
   complete turbine simulation also reveals that the downstream wake of the
   turbine consists of three main regions: (1) the outer layer with the
   spiral blade tip vortices rotating in the same direction as the blades;
   (2) the counter-rotating inner layer surrounded by the spiral tip
   vortices; and (3) the core layer co-rotating with respect to the tip
   vortices. This study is the first to report the three-dimensional wake
   structure of MHK turbines. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Hardware constraints, scanning time limitations, patient movement, and
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) considerations, restrict the slice-selection
   and the in-plane resolutions of MRI differently, generally resulting in
   anisotropic voxels. This nonuniform sampling can be problematic,
   especially in image segmentation and clinical examination. To alleviate
   this, the acquisition is divided into (two or) three separate scans,
   with higher in-plane resolutions and thick slices, yet orthogonal
   slice-selection directions. In this work, a noniterative wavelet-based
   approach for combining the three orthogonal scans is adopted, and its
   advantages compared with other existing methods, such as Fourier
   techniques, are discussed, including the consideration of the actual
   pulse response of the MRI scanner, and its lower computational
   complexity. Experimental results are shown on simulated and real 7 T MRI

Abstract = {{Since their introduction in the early 1990's, automated recommender
   systems have revolutionized the marketing and delivery of commerce and

   the user experience with the recommender. We show through examples that
   the embedding of the algorithm in the user experience dramatically
   affects the value to the user of the recommender. We argue that
   evaluating the user experience of a recommender requires a broader set
   of measures than have been commonly used, and suggest additional
   measures that have proven effective. Based on our analysis of the state
   of the field, we identify the most important open research problems, and

Abstract = {{Aims: To characterize the HAA-degrading bacteria in drinking water
   systems.
   Methods and Results: Haloacetic acid (HAA)-degrading bacteria were
   analysed in drinking water systems by cultivation and by a novel
   application of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism
   (tRFLP). Substantial similarities were observed among the tRFLP patterns
   of dehI and dehII gene fragments in drinking water samples obtained from
   three different cities (Minneapolis, MN; St Paul, MN; Bucharest,
   Romania) and from one biologically active granular activated carbon
   filter (Hershey, PA). The dominant fragment in the tRFLP profiles of
   dehI genes from the drinking water samples matched the pattern from an
   Afipia sp. that was previously isolated from drinking water. In
   contrast, the dominant fragment in the tRFLP profiles of dehII genes did
   not match any previously characterized dehII gene fragment. PCR cloning
   was used to characterize this gene fragment, which had < 65\% nucleotide
   sequence identity with any previously characterized dehII gene.
   Conclusions: Afipia spp. are an appropriate model organism for studying
   the biodegradation of HAAs in drinking water distribution systems as
   encoded by dehI genes; the organism that harbours the most prominent
   dehII gene in drinking water has yet to be cultivated and identified.
   Significance and Impact of the Study: The development of a novel
   application of tRFLP targeting dehI and dehII genes could be broadly
   useful in understanding HAA-degrading bacteria in numerous environments.}},

Journal = {{BIORESOURCE TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{7-12}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{An alkaline protease from Bacillus licheniformis, Protex 6L, was used
   for synthesis of sucrose monolaurate from sucrose and vinyl laurate in a
   tert-amyl alcohol/DMSO/water solvent mixture. Introducing sucrose as
   powder after mixing vinyl laurate with solvent mixture resulted in a
   higher reaction rate than when sucrose was added as a solution in DMSO.
   Response surface methodology (RSM) was applied to optimize the major
   reaction variables, water content, temperature and pH of the lyophilized
   enzyme. The optimal conditions derived from RSM (3.4\% water content, 43
   degrees C and pH of 10.1) provided a high initial reaction rate of 8.66
   +/- 0.3 mg/ml/h which agreed with the predicted value of 8.70 mg/ml/h.
   With 1.5 mg-enzyme/ml, 98.0\% of the added sucrose was
   region-selectively converted to 1'-O-lauroylsucrose after 9 h. Under the
   optimized conditions, Protex 6L exhibited a higher productivity for
   sucrose ester synthesis than Novozym 435 and three other commonly used

Journal = {{GENOME RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{704-713}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Ty1, the most abundant retrotransposon in Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
   integrates preferentially upstream of genes transcribed by RNA
   polymerase III (Pol III). Targeting is likely due to interactions
   between the Ty1 integration complex and a feature of chromatin
   characteristic of sites of Pal Ill transcription. To better understand
   Ty1 targeting determinants, >150,000 Ty1 insertions were mapped onto the
   S. cerevisiaegenome sequence. Logistic regression was used to assess
   relationships between patterns of Ty1 integration and various genomic
   features, including genome-wide data sets of histone modifications and
   transcription-factor binding sites. Nucleosomes were positively
   associated with Ty1 insertions, and fine-scale mapping of insertions
   upstream of genes transcribed by Pol III indicated that Ty1
   preferentially integrates into nucleosome-bound DNA near the H2A/H2B
   interface. Outside of genes transcribed by Pol III, Ty1 avoids coding
   sequences, a pattern that is not due to selection, but rather reflects a
   preference for nucleosome-rich sites flanking genes. Ty1 insertion sites
   were also mapped in four mutant lines that affect Ty1 transposition
   frequency or integration specificity (rrm3 Delta, hos2 Delta, rtt109
   Delta, and rad6 Delta). Patterns of integration were largely preserved
   in the mutants, although significantly more insertions into coding
   sequences were observed in the rad6 Delta strain, suggesting a loosening
   of target specificity in this mutant that lacks an enzyme involved in
   ubiquitinating H2A. Overall, our data suggest that nucleosomes are
   necessary for Ty1 integration, and that a secondary factor, likely a
   histone modification or nucleosome-bound factor enriched at sites of Pol
   III transcription, determines preferred target sites.}},

Abstract = {{A combinatorial genetic perturbation strategy was applied to interrogate
   the yeast kinome on a genome-wide scale. We assessed the global effects
   of gene overexpression or gene deletion to map an integrated genetic
   interaction network of synthetic dosage lethal (SDL) and
   loss-of-function genetic interactions (GIs) for 92 kinases, producing a
   meta-network of 8700 GIs enriched for pathways known to be regulated by
   cognate kinases. Kinases most sensitive to dosage perturbations had
   constitutive cell cycle or cell polarity functions under standard growth
   conditions. Condition-specific screens confirmed that the spectrum of
   kinase dosage interactions can be expanded substantially in activating
   conditions. An integrated network composed of systematic SDL, negative
   and positive loss-of-function GIs, and literature-curated
   kinase-substrate interactions revealed kinase-dependent regulatory
   motifs predictive of novel gene-specific phenotypes. Our study provides
   a valuable resource to unravel novel functional relationships and
   pathways regulated by kinases and outlines a general strategy for
   deciphering mutant phenotypes from large-scale GI networks.}},

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1571-1584}},

Abstract = {{Nonparametric methods are widely applicable to statistical inference
   problems, since they rely on a few modeling assumptions. In this
   context, the fresh look advocated here permeates benefits from variable
   selection and compressive sampling, to robustify nonparametric
   regression against outliers-that is, data markedly deviating from the
   postulated models. A variational counterpart to least-trimmed squares
   regression is shown closely related to an l(0)-(pseudo) norm-regularized
   estimator, that encourages sparsity in a vector explicitly modeling the
   outliers. This connection suggests efficient solvers based on convex
   relaxation, which lead naturally to a variational M-type estimator
   equivalent to the least-absolute shrinkage and selection operator
   (Lasso). Outliers are identified by judiciously tuning regularization
   parameters, which amounts to controlling the sparsity of the outlier
   vector along the whole robustification path of Lasso solutions. Reduced
   bias and enhanced generalization capability are attractive features of
   an improved estimator obtained after replacing the l(0)-(pseudo) norm
   with a nonconvex surrogate. The novel robust spline-based smoother is
   adopted to cleanse load curve data, a key task aiding operational
   decisions in the envisioned smart grid system. Computer simulations and
   tests on real load curve data corroborate the effectiveness of the novel
   sparsity-controlling robust estimators.}},

Abstract = {{Throughput-optimal multihop wireless network operation entails a key
   physical-layer optimization problem: maximizing a weighted sum of link
   rates, with weights given by the differential queue backlogs. This
   emerges in joint back-pressure routing and power control, which is
   central in cross-layer wireless networking. We begin by showing that the
   core problem is not only nonconvex, but also NP-hard. This is a negative
   result, which however comes with a positive flip side: drawing from
   related developments in the digital subscriber line (DSL) literature, we
   propose effective ways to approximate it. Exploiting quasi-periodicity
   of the power allocation in stable setups due to the push-pull nature of
   the solution, we derive two custom algorithms that offer excellent
   throughput performance at reasonable, worst-case polynomial complexity.
   Judicious simulations illustrate the merits of the proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in using recycled manure solids (RMS) as a bedding material for
   dairy cows has grown in the US Midwest. Cost of common bedding materials
   has increased in recent years and availability has decreased.
   Information regarding the composition of RMS and its use as a bedding
   material for dairy cows in the Midwest is very limited. The objectives
   of this study were to characterize RMS as a bedding material, observe
   bedding management practices, document methods of obtaining RMS, and
   describe housing facilities. We visited 38 Midwest dairy operations
   bedding freestalls with RMS to collect data. Methods of obtaining RMS
   for bedding included separation of anaerobic digested manure, separation
   of raw manure, and separation of raw manure followed by mechanical
   drum-composting for 18 to 24 h. Average bedding moisture of unused RMS
   was 72.4\% with a pH of 9.16. Unused samples contained (on a dry basis)
   1.4\% N, 44.9\% C, 32.7 C:N ratio, 0.44\% P, 0.70\% K, 76.5\% neutral
   detergent fiber, 9.4\% ash, 4.4\% nonfiber carbohydrates, and 1.1\% fat.
   Moisture was lowest for drum-composted solids before and after use as
   freestall bedding. After use in the stalls, digested solids had lower
   neutral detergent fiber content (70.5\%) than drum-composted (75.0\%)
   and separated raw (73.1\%) solids. Total N content was greater in
   digested solids (2.0\%) than in separated raw (1.7\%) solids. Total
   bacterial populations in unused bedding were greatest in separated raw
   manure solids but were similar between digested and drum-composted
   manure solids. Drum-composted manure solids had no coliform bacteria
   before use as freestall bedding. After use as bedding, digested manure
   solids had lower total bacteria counts compared with drum-composted and
   separated raw manure solids, which had similar counts. Used bedding
   samples of digested solids contained fewer environmental streptococci
   than drum-composted and separated raw solids and had reduced Bacillus
   counts compared with separated raw solids. Coliform counts were similar
   for all 3 bedding sources. Addition of a mechanical blower
   post-separation and use of a shelter for storage were associated with
   reduced fresh-bedding moisture but not associated with bacterial counts.
   This was the first survey of herds using RMS for bedding in the Midwest.
   We learned that RMS was being used successfully as a source of bedding
   for dairy cows. For most farms in the study, somatic cell count was
   comparable to the average in the region and not excessively high.}},

Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{99-109}},

Abstract = {{Compact piezoelectric actuators based on an oval loop shell structure
   were fabricated and their vibration characteristics were investigated.
   The actuators can successfully create a translational motion at a high
   frequency and a large displacement working distance at the second
   resonant mode of the shell structure. As a result of a shot peening
   process to harden the surface and increase the strength of the shell
   structures, fatigue limits were enhanced. The highest operating
   frequency of 1444 Hz was achieved with about 1.5 mm translational
   displacement under an applied voltage of 100 VAC. The largest amplified
   displacement of 2.1 mm was obtained at a resonant frequency of 961 Hz.
   Displacement amplification ratios between static and resonance
   conditions are presented and compared. A theoretical approach was
   provided to estimate the natural frequencies of the oval loop shell
   actuators. The estimated natural frequencies of the actuators agreed
   with experimental values to within 12\%. In addition, load bearing
   capacity and efficiency of one of the shell actuators was evaluated with
   an experimental method. The calculated actuator efficiency is around
   55\% when 3.1 g of mass is loaded to the actuator and an applied voltage
   of 140 V is applied. A possible application of the actuator, a cooling
   device, was demonstrated by providing its configuration and test
   results. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   applied to study MEG interictal spikes from five epilepsy patients.

Abstract = {{Walking is the most natural form of locomotion for humans, and real
   walking interfaces have demonstrated their benefits for several
   navigation tasks. With recently proposed redirection techniques it
   becomes possible to overcome space limitations as imposed by tracking
   sensors or laboratory setups, and, theoretically, it is now possible to
   walk through arbitrarily large virtual environments. However, walking as
   sole locomotion technique has drawbacks, in particular, for long
   distances, such that even in the real world we tend to support walking
   with passive or active transportation for longer-distance travel. In
   this article we show that concepts from the field of redirected walking
   can be applied to movements with transportation devices. We conducted
   psychophysical experiments to determine perceptual detection thresholds
   for redirected driving, and set these in relation to results from
   redirected walking. We show that redirected walking-and-driving
   approaches can easily be realized in immersive virtual reality
   laboratories, e. g., with electric wheelchairs, and show that such
   systems can combine advantages of real walking in confined spaces with
   benefits of using vehicle-based self-motion for longer-distance travel.}},

Title = {{Origin of Two Modes of Non-isothermal Crystallization of Glasses

Abstract = {{To mechanistically explain the origin of two distinct non-isothermal
   crystallization modes, single-peak (unimodal) and two-peak (bimodal), of
   organic glasses.
   Glasses of ten organic molecules were prepared by melt-quenching and
   cryogenic milling of crystals. Non-isothermal crystallization of glasses
   was monitored using differential scanning calorimetry and powder X-ray
   diffractometry.
   The non-isothermal crystallization of glass, generated by milling, is
   either unimodal or bimodal, while that of melt-quenched glass without
   being milled is always unimodal. The mode of crystallization of
   amorphous phase depends on the relative position of the crystallization
   onset (T (c) ) with respect to glass transition temperature (T (g) ),
   and can be explained by a surface crystallization model. Bimodal
   crystallization event is observed when T (c) is below or near T (g) ,
   due to the fast crystallization onset at milled glass surfaces. Unimodal
   crystallization is observed when T (c) is well above T (g) . We have
   verified this model by intentionally inducing flip between the two
   crystallization modes for several compounds through manipulating glass
   surface area and T (c) .
   The two modes of crystallization of organic glasses is a result of the
   combined effects of faster surface crystallization and variation in
   specific surface area by milling.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the effect of insulin supplementation and hypoxic culture
   (2\% vs. 20\% oxygen tension) on collagen deposition and mechanical
   properties of fibrin-based tubular tissue constructs seeded with
   neonatal human dermal fibroblasts. The results presented here
   demonstrate that constructs cultured under hypoxic conditions with
   insulin supplementation increased in collagen density by approximately
   five-fold and both the ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and modulus by
   more than three-fold compared with normoxic (20\% oxygen tension),
   noninsulin supplemented controls. In addition, collagen deposited on a
   per-cell basis increased by approximately four-fold. Interaction was
   demonstrated for hypoxia and insulin in combination in terms of UTS and
   collagen production on a per-cell basis. This interaction resulted from
   two distinct processes involved in collagen fibril formation. Western
   blot analysis showed that insulin supplementation alone increased Akt
   phosphorylation and the combined treatment increased collagen
   prolyl-4-hydroxylase. These molecules are distinct regulators of
   collagen deposition, having an impact at both the transcriptional and
   posttranslational modification stages of collagen fibril formation that,
   in turn, increase collagen density in the tissue constructs. These
   findings highlight the potential of utilizing insulin supplementation
   and hypoxic culture in combination to increase the mechanical strength
   and stiffness of fibrin-based engineered tissues.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactide is a bio-based and biodegradable polymer well-known for its
   renewable origins. Water sorption and clustering behavior in both a
   homopolymer polylactide and a graft copolymer of polylactide was studied
   using the quartz crystal microbalance/heat conduction calorimetry
   (QCM/HCC) technique. The graft copolymer,
   poly(1,5-cyclooctadiene-co-5-norbornene-2-methanol-graft-D,L-lactide),
   contained polylactide chains (95 wt.\%) grafted onto a hydrophobic
   rubbery backbone (5 wt.\%). Clustering is an important phenomenon in the
   study of water transport properties in polymers since the presence of
   water clusters can affect the water diffusivity. The HCC method using
   the thermal power signals and Van't Hoff's law were both employed to
   estimate the water sorption enthalpy. Sorption enthalpy of water in both
   polymers was determined to be approximately -40 kJ/mol for all water
   activity levels. Zimm-Lundberg analysis showed that water clusters start
   to form at a water activity of 0.4. The engaged species induced
   clustering (ENSIC) model was used to curve fit sorption isotherms and
   showed that the affinity among water molecules is higher than that
   between water molecules and polymer chains. All the methods used
   indicate that clustering of water molecules exists in both polymers. (C)

Abstract = {{Localization of wireless sensor nodes has long been regarded as a
   problem that is difficult to solve, especially when considering
   characteristics of real-world environments. This paper formally
   describes, designs, implements, and evaluates a novel localization
   system called Spotlight. The system uses spatiotemporal properties of
   well-controlled events in the network, light in this case, to obtain
   locations of sensor nodes. Performance of the system is evaluated
   through deployments of Mica2 and XSM motes in an outdoor environment,
   where 20 cm localization error is achieved. A sensor network consisting
   of any number of nodes deployed in a 2; 500 m(2) area can be localized
   in under 10 minutes. Submeter localization error in an outdoor
   environment is made possible without equipping the wireless sensor nodes
   with specialized ranging hardware.}},

Abstract = {{The RANS method with Saffman's turbulence model was employed to solve

   complete structures of the oscillating pipe flows and the averaged
   Nusselt numbers on the tube wall were provided by numerical simulations
   over wide ranges of the Reynolds number and the Keulegan-Carpenter

   laminar flow results to analytic solutions and turbulence flow results
   to published experimental data. The effects of the governing parameters
   on the velocity, temperature, and Nusselt number distributions are
   discussed. The enhancement of the heat transfer due to oscillating flows
   has also been presented. The optimal ratio of the tube diameter over the
   oscillation amplitude was obtained based on the existence of a nearly
   constant optimal Keulegan-Carpenter number. The potential application of
   the present results in sea water cooling is also discussed. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{The reformation of a body fundamentally involves the mapping of one
   natural reference configuration of it into another natural reference
   configuration. The mass and the constitutive properties of the material
   remain unaltered, but the overall shape of the reference configuration
   generally changes. If, when a natural reference configuration is
   distorted, there is a portion of the boundary of the body that is
   displacement controlled, then a reformation of the body must be such
   that the original displacement controlled part of the boundary and its
   reformation are identical. In common applications that involve
   reformation, the remainder of the boundary is traction-free and a
   reformation essentially involves a change of the morphology of this
   traction-free surface. For example, undulations are often a
   characteristic feature of the reformation of a free, plane boundary
   surface. Reformations are a result of a material instability and they
   may associate with a chemically induced diffusive processes in which
   particles of the body move into preferred places. Fundamentally, a
   reformation is generated in response to the drive to lower the total
   stored energy of the body. In this work we are not concerned with the
   physical processes that take place during reformation, but rather we are
   concerned with characterizing the onset of the instability. We develop a
   variational characterization of the reformation instability for a
   nonlinear elastic body and we include the effect of surface energy. As
   an example, we consider the axial deformation of a circular cylinder and
   argue that small scale nano-wires, for which the diameter-to-length
   ratio is sufficiently small, are expected to be stable with respect to
   spatial variations when extended. Moreover, we observe that if the
   surfacial energy function is sufficiently convex at the undistorted
   state such wires may also be stable with respect to spatial variations
   when compressed. We then show that such small scale nano-wires are
   unstable with respect to reformation when either extended or compressed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents two new, efficient solutions to the two-view,
   relative pose problem from three image point correspondences and one
   common reference direction. This three-plus-one problem can be used
   either as a substitute for the classic five-point algorithm, using a
   vanishing point for the reference direction, or to make use of an
   inertial measurement unit commonly available on robots and mobile
   devices where the gravity vector becomes the reference direction. We
   provide a simple, closed-form solution and a solution based on algebraic
   geometry which offers numerical advantages. In addition, we introduce a
   new method for computing visual odometry with RANSAC and four point
   correspondences per hypothesis. In a set of real experiments, we
   demonstrate the power of our approach by comparing it to the five-point
   method in a hypothesize-and-test visual odometry setting.}},

Abstract = {{Glass transition temperature (Tg) breadths are reported for polystyrene
   (PS) micelle cores in two series of micelle-forming block copolymers
   {[}PS-poly(ethylene oxide) and PS-poly(methyl methacrylate)] with an
   ionic liquid solvent (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium
   bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)amide). An increased level of fluorescent
   molecules was induced within the cores upon rapid cooling followed by
   aging. Using fluorescence to monitor dye release with relaxation of this
   state upon heating, transition onset and end-point temperatures were
   defined. The system with the lowest PS-block molecular weight showed no
   evidence of a transition above 25 degrees C; however, in every other
   case, transitions were observed beginning at similar to 40-45 degrees C
   and ending at similar to 60-85 degrees C. These temperatures closely
   match PS-block Tg results measured by differential scanning calorimetry
   in semidilute solutions of the same materials, suggesting that the
   transition temperature range correlates strongly to the transition of
   the cores from fully glassy to fully rubbery. Differences in transition
   end-points were related to PS-block molecular weights and relative
   copolymer fractions of PS. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Polym Sci

Title = {{Automatic geomorphic feature extraction from lidar in flat and
   engineered landscapes}},
Journal = {{WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{48}},
Month = {{MAR 29}},
Abstract = {{High-resolution topographic data derived from light detection and
   ranging (lidar) technology enables detailed geomorphic observations to
   be made on spatially extensive areas in a way that was previously not
   possible. Availability of this data provides new opportunities to study
   the spatial organization of landscapes and channel network features,
   increase the accuracy of environmental transport models, and inform
   decisions for targeting conservation practices. However, with the
   opportunity of increased resolution topographic data come formidable
   challenges in terms of automatic geomorphic feature extraction,
   analysis, and interpretation. Low-relief landscapes are particularly
   challenging because topographic gradients are low, and in many places
   both the landscape and the channel network have been heavily modified by
   humans. This is especially true for agricultural landscapes, which
   dominate the midwestern United States. The goal of this work is to
   address several issues related to feature extraction in flat lands by
   using GeoNet, a recently developed method based on nonlinear multiscale
   filtering and geodesic optimization for automatic extraction of
   geomorphic features (channel heads and channel networks) from
   high-resolution topographic data. Here we test the ability of GeoNet to
   extract channel networks in flat and human-impacted landscapes using 3 m
   lidar data for the Le Sueur River Basin, a 2880 km(2) subbasin of the
   Minnesota River Basin. We propose a curvature analysis to differentiate
   between channels and manmade structures that are not part of the river
   network, such as roads and bridges. We document that Laplacian curvature
   more effectively distinguishes channels in flat, human-impacted
   landscapes compared with geometric curvature. In addition, we develop a
   method for performing automated channel morphometric analysis including
   extraction of cross sections, detection of bank locations, and
   identification of geomorphic bankfull water surface elevation. Using the
   slope plotted along each channel-floodplain cross section, we
   demonstrate the ability to identify and measure the height of river
   banks and bluffs. Finally, we present an example that demonstrates how
   extracting such features automatically is important for modeling channel
   evolution, water and sediment transport, and channel-floodplain sediment
   exchange.}},

Abstract = {{Extinction spectra of colloidal germanium nanocrystals suspended in
   benzonitrile without the use of ligands were measured, and absolute
   absorption cross sections are reported. Comparison to cross sections
   calculated using the Mie solution to Maxwell's equations reveals that,
   as the mean nanocrystal size is reduced from 11 to 4 nm, the absorption
   features below 3.5 eV blueshift because of quantum confinement effects.
   The shifts are not, however, sufficiently large for the nanocrystal
   cores to produce the blue photoluminescence commonly observed from
   germanium nanocrystals. At energies greater than 3.5 eV the Mie and
   measured cross sections overlap, indicating a bulk-like band structure.
