Abstract = {{A wide-tuning range QVCO with a novel complimentary-coupling scheme is
   presented. Two NMOS-only VCOs are coupled via complimentary PMOS
   injection transistors. This shifts the injection current away from the
   zero-crossings of the output voltage, thereby reducing the sensitivity
   of the VCO to injection noise, which results in significant phase-noise
   improvement. Phase-shift is achieved without frequency-dependent
   phase-shifting networks, allowing robust coupling over a wide tuning
   range. As a proof-of-concept, a prototype is designed in TSMC 65nm
   process with 4-bits of discrete tuning spanning the frequency range
   4.6-7.8 GHz (52\% tuning range). The prototype operates from 0.5V
   supply, with a power consumption ranging from 7.4mW-11mW, while
   achieving a minimum figure-of-merit (FOM) of 181.6dBc/Hz, and a minimum
   figure-of-merit with tuning-range (FOMT) of 196dBc/Hz.}},

   transmission in the downlink of a wireless heterogeneous network
   (HetNet). The partial coordination is crucial in trading off system
   performance with backhaul overhead, and it is achieved through jointly
   optimizing the base station (BS) clustering and the downlink
   beamformers. Unlike many existing works, we focus on the practical
   scenario where the channel state information (CSI) is
   imperfect/incomplete at the transmitter. Mathematically, we formulate
   the problem into a penalized stochastic optimization problem, and
   propose an algorithm that converges almost surely to its stationary
   solution set. Interestingly, our method does not require any additional
   computational complexity or memory compared to the existing algorithms
   using perfect CSI. Effectiveness of our method is validated through
   numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This work investigates the problem of anomaly detection by means of an
   agnostic inference strategy based on the concepts of spatial saliency
   and data sparsity. Specifically, it addresses the implementation and
   experimental validation aspects of a salient feature extraction
   methodology that was recently proposed for laser-based diagnostics and
   leverages the wavefield spatial reconstruction capability offered by
   scanning laser vibrometers. The methodology consists of two steps. The
   first is a spatiotemporal windowing strategy designed to partition the
   structural domain in small sub-domains and replicate impinging wave
   conditions at each location. The second is the construction of a
   low-rank-plus-outlier model of the regional data set using principal
   component analysis. Regions are labeled salient when their behavior does
   not belong to a common low-dimensional subspace that successfully
   describes the typical behavior of the anomaly-free portion of the
   surrounding medium. The most attractive feature of this method is that
   it requires virtually no knowledge of the structural and material
   properties of the medium. This property makes it a powerful diagnostic
   tool for the inspection of media with pronounced heterogeneity or with
   unknown or unreliable material property distributions, e.g., as a result
   of severe material degradation over large portions of their domain.}},

Abstract = {{Foodborne diseases cause an estimated 48 million illnesses each year in
   the United States, including 9.4 million caused by known pathogens. Real
   time detection of cases and outbreak sources are important epidemic
   intelligence services that can decrease morbidity and mortality of
   foodborne illnesses, and allow optimal response to identify the causal
   pathways leading to contamination. For most outbreaks associated with
   fresh produce items, outbreak source detection typically occurs after
   the contaminated produce items have been consumed and are no longer in
   the marketplace. We developed a probabilistic model for real time
   outbreak source detection, prediction of outbreaks, and
   contaminationprone area mapping with the aim of developing a
   cyber-infrastructure to support this activity. The models inputs include
   environmental, trade and epidemiological dynamics. Because effective
   distance reliably predicts disease arrival times we estimate the
   distance of outbreak sources from spatio-temporal patterns of foodborne
   outbreaks. As a case study we consider the 2013 Cyclospora outbreaks in
   the USA that were related to contaminated fresh produce (cilantro and
   fresh salad mix) from Mexico. We are able to match case distributions
   related to both food commodities and determine their outbreak sources
   with an average accuracy of 0.93. Assuming a similar pattern of
   contamination for 2014, outbreak patterns can be similar or worse with
   an unchanged food trade that is likely. The study aims to provide a
   methodological framework to evaluate environmentally sensitive food
   contamination and assess interdependencies of socio-environmental
   factors causing contamination. We emphasize the linkage of patterns and
   processes, the positive role of uncertainty, and challenge the belief
   that information about the whole food supply chain is needed for
   traceback analysis to be useful for identifying likely sources. Our
   specific prediction strongly emphasizes the need for real-time
   surveillance to identify and respond to this pending outbreak.}},

   We show how origin tracking can be integrated into higher-order

   evaluation. Furthermore, we extend origins with additional information
   to track sub trees that correspond to the redex and contractum of

Abstract = {{Given emerging diverse spatio temporal network (STN) datasets, e.g., GPS
   tracks, temporally detailed roadmaps and traffic signal data, the aim is
   to develop a logical data-model which achieves a seamless integration of
   these datasets for diverse use-cases (queries) and supports efficient
   algorithms. This problem is important for travel itinerary comparison
   and navigation applications. However, this is challenging due to the
   conflicting requirements of expressive power and computational
   efficiency as well as the need to support ever more diverse STN
   datasets, which now record non-decomposable properties of n-ary
   relations. Examples include travel-time and fuel-use during a journey on
   a route with a sequence of coordinated traffic signals and turn delays.
   Current data models for STN datasets are limited to representing
   properties of only binary relations, e.g., distance on individual road
   segments. In contrast, the proposed logical data-model, Lagrangian
   Xgraphs can express properties of both binary and n-ary relations. Our
   initial study shows that Lagrangian Xgraphs are more convenient for
   representing diverse STN datasets and comparing candidate travel

Abstract = {{Cracking is a major distress mechanism in asphalt pavements. Thermal
   cracking is especially prevalent in Northern Minnesota and other areas
   with cold climates. Developing asphalt mix designs that are more
   resistant to cracking distresses is necessary to reduce maintenance and
   rehabilitation expenditures. The present study involves analysis of over
   32,000 asphalt mixes and approximately 12,000 field sections available
   from Minnesota Department of Transportation (MnDOT).
   The main objective of this work is to identify the effects of asphalt
   binder content and binder grade on the actual field cracking
   performance. A comprehensive database has been developed that includes
   mix design information (design traffic level, mix size, binder type,
   wear versus non-wear course), mix volumetrics and gradation (air voids,
   voids in mineral aggregates, voids filled with asphalt, adjusted asphalt
   film thickness, percent passing on control sieves, recycled fractions),
   and actual field performance data from MnDOT's pavement management
   system.
   This database has made it possible to quantify the effects of binder
   content and grade on the actual field performance. A series of
   statistical tests were conducted to determine if significant
   relationships exist between the binder content and grade, and the field

Abstract = {{A method has been devised and tested for measuring the c-axis
   orientation of crystal grains in thin sections of glacier ice. The
   crystal orientation and grain size of ice are of great interest to
   glaciologists since these parameters contain information on the prior
   thermal and flow history of the ice. The traditional method of
   determining c-axis orientation involves a transmission measurement
   through an ice sample, a process that is time-consuming and therefore
   impractical for obtaining a continuous record. A reflection- or
   backscatter-based method could potentially be used inside boreholes,
   with bubbles as reflectors to avoid such drawbacks. The concept
   demonstration of this paper is performed on ice slices, enabling a
   direct comparison of accuracy with traditional methods. Measurements of
   the crystal orientations (phi, theta) in 11 grains showed an average
   error of +/- 0.8 degrees in phi, with no grain error >1.4 degrees
   Measurements of theta showed an average error of +/- 8.2 degrees on ten
   grains, with unexplained disagreement on the remaining grain. Although
   the technique is applied specifically to glacier ice, it should be
   generally applicable to any transparent birefringent polycrystalline
   material.}},

Pages = {{139-145}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Lightweight graphene structures have promising applications, for example
   as separation media, as microreactor environments, for use in energy
   storage or in microelectronics. The assembly of graphene or its
   derivatives into such frameworks typically requires rather elaborate and
   expensive methods which are moreover difficult to scale up. In the
   present work we propose a simpler route which is based on arresting the
   temperature induced phase separation in a water-lutidine mixture
   containing graphene oxide particles. The 2D nature of graphene oxide
   sheets, combined with an adequate surface chemistry simply controlled by
   their carbon to oxygen ratio, causes them to collect and assemble at the
   interfaces and create highly elastic layers which arrest the phase
   separation process. Soft solid graphene oxide frameworks are created
   which have sufficient mechanical stability to allow removal of the
   solvents by freeze drying. The advantage of the method is that the
   structure and mesh size of the frameworks can be easily controlled,
   providing direct access to the graphene-oxide surfaces while creating a
   mechanically robust and percolating network of graphene oxide tiles.
   This could be used, for example, as electrodes for supercapacitors or
   fuel cells.}},

Abstract = {{A wind tunnel experiment was performed to study turbulence processes
   within a model wind turbine array of 3 by 8 model wind turbines of
   alternating sizes placed aligned with the mean flow. The model wind farm
   was placed in a boundary layer developed over both smooth and rough
   surfaces under neutrally stratified conditions. Turbulence statistics,
   TKE budget terms, and the spectral structure of the turbulence generated
   within and above the wind farm reveal relevant information about the
   processes modulating the turbulent energy transfer from the boundary
   layer to the turbines. The results of the experiment suggest that
   heterogeneity in turbine size within a wind farm introduce complex flow
   interactions not seen in a homogeneous farm, and may have positive
   effects on turbulent loading on the turbines and turbulent exchange with
   the atmosphere. In general, large scale motions are heavily dampened
   behind the first row of turbines but a portion of such structures are
   generated far inside the wind farm, and the scale of the most energetic
   eddy motions was relatively consistent at different elevations. Overall,
   the experiment revealed the possibility that heterogeneity of wind
   turbine size within wind farms have the potential to change the overall
   potential to harvest energy from the wind, and alter the economics of a

Abstract = {{The layouts of turbines affect the turbine wake interactions and thus
   the wind farm performance. The wake interactions in infinite staggered
   wind-turbine arrays are investigated and compared with infinite aligned
   turbine arrays in this paper. From the numerical results we identify
   three types of wake behaviours, which are significantly different from
   wakes in aligned wind-turbine arrays. For the first type, each turbine
   wake interferes with the pair of staggered downstream turbine wakes and
   the aligned downstream turbine. For the second type, each turbine wake
   interacts with the first two downstream turbine wakes but does not show
   significant interference with the second aligned downstream turbine. For
   the third type, each turbine wake recovers immediately after passing
   through the gap of the first two downstream turbines and has little
   interaction with the second downstream turbine wakes The extracted power
   density and power efficiency are also studied and compared with aligned

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer technology is considered as one of the promising
   solutions to address the energy limitation problems for end-devices, but
   its incurred potential risk of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure
   is largely overlooked by most existing works. In this paper, we consider
   the Safe Charging with Adjustable PowEr (SCAPE) problem, namely, how to
   adjust the power of chargers to maximize the charging utility of
   devices, while assuring that EMR intensity at any location in the field
   does not exceed a given threshold R-t. We present novel techniques to
   reformulate SCAPE into a traditional linear programming problem, and
   then remove its redundant constraints as much as possible to reduce
   computational effort. Next, we propose a distributed algorithm with
   provable approximation ratio (1 - epsilon). Through extensive simulation
   and testbed experiments, we demonstrate that our (1 -
   epsilon)-approximation algorithm outperforms the Set-Cover algorithm by
   up to 23\%, and has an average performance gain of 41.1\% over the SCP
   algorithm in terms of the overall charging utility.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity-achieving polar codes have received significant attention in
   past few years. These codes can be decoded using either the
   successive-cancellation (SC) approach or the belief propagation (BP)
   approach. Several VLSI architectures of SC polar decoders have been
   reported in the literature. However, SC decoders suffer from long
   latency and low throughput due to their sequential decoding nature. On
   the other hand, although the BP decoders can be operated in an
   inherently parallel manner with high throughput, the functional units in
   these decoders are underutilized. In this paper, we exploit various
   architecture transformation techniques to further improve hardware
   performance of polar BP decoders. First, we propose an
   overlapped-scheduling approach at iteration level to reduce the overall
   decoding latency. Second, we propose codeword-level overlap to further
   improve hardware utilization efficiency. Third, we show that the above
   two overlapping approaches can be unified into a general framework into
   a joint overlapping approach. Fourth, we exploit the folding technique
   to design low-complexity polar BP decoders, and present two types of
   folded architectures. Synthesis results show that the proposed two
   (1024, 512) polar BP decoder designs can achieve 1.50 and 2.43 times
   reduction in hardware complexity, respectively. In addition, the
   proposed two designs can also achieve 7.4 and 2.5 times improvement in
   hardware efficiency, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses implementation of IIR digital filters using
   stochastic computing. Stochastic computing requires fewer logic gates
   and is inherently fault-tolerant. Thus, these structures are well suited
   for deep sub-micron technologies. While it is easy to realize FIR
   digital filters using stochastic computing, implementation of IIR
   digital filters is non-trivial. Stochastic logic assumes independence of
   input signals; however, the feedback in IIR digital filters leads to
   correlation of input signals and the independence assumption is
   violated. The novelty of this paper lies in demonstrating that, despite
   the feedback in IIR filters, these filters can be implemented using
   stochastic logic. The key to stochastic implementation is selection of
   an IIR filter structure where the states are orthogonal and are,
   therefore, uncorrelated. Two architectures are presented for stochastic
   IIR digital filter. Both architectures are based on the lattice filter
   representation where the states are orthogonal. The first is based on a
   state-space description of the IIR filter derived from the lattice
   filter structure. The second is based on transforming the lattice IIR
   digital filter into an equivalent form that can exploit the novel
   scaling approach developed in our prior work for inner product
   computations. Our experimental results show that the two proposed
   architectures for stochastic IIR digital filters can lead to one to two
   orders of magnitude reduction in the output error-to-signal power ratio,
   compared to stochastic implementations using direct-form IIR filters.
   Furthermore, for higher-order filters, while stochastic direct-form
   structures fail to function correctly, the state-space and lattice based
   stochastic IIR digital filters always filter the input signals in a
   functionally correct manner.}},

   efficiency is still challenging due to the inherent serial nature of SC

   for designing both the time-constrained and resource-constrained

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to protect. digital signal
   processing (DSP) circuits through obfuscation by using high-level
   transformations. The goal is to design DSP circuits that are harder to
   reverse engineer. High-level transformations of iterative data-flow
   graphs have been exploited for area-speed-power tradeoffs. This is the
   first attempt to develop a design flow to apply high-level
   transformations that not only meet these tradeoffs but also
   simultaneously obfuscate the architectures both structurally and
   functionally. Several modes of operations are introduced for obfuscation
   where the outputs are either meaningful from a signal processing point
   of view, but functionally incorrect, or non-meaningful Experimental
   results show that the proposed methodology only introduces relatively
   small overhead, while a high level of obfuscation is achieved. For
   instance, the area overhead for a (31)th-order IIR filter benchmark is
   only 17.7\% with a 128-bit configuration key.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-level matrix converter (MMC) is a three phase ac-ac converter that
   can synthesize three or more levels at the output voltage while
   maintaining desired input power factor. In this paper a new converter,
   Capacitor clamped Multi-level Matrix converter (CMMC) has been proposed
   as an addition to the MMC family. In comparison to conventional matrix
   converter, the CMMC offers an additional level at the output voltage.
   This leads to lower THD and voltage stress. This additional voltage is
   obtained by means of clamp capacitors which are maintained at half of
   input line to line voltages. An indirect space vector based modulation
   strategy is presented for generating desired output voltage at desired
   input power factor while balancing the clamp capacitor voltage at
   desired voltage level. The effectiveness of the proposed converter has
   been verified by means of numerical simulation.}},

   layers can be chosen to obtain the minimum power loss. This thickness
   range is a function of the number of layers and does not include the
   ``optimum{''} based on the previous literature. Using this design
   procedure, it is shown that interleaving is not necessary in foil -wound
   transformers to obtain the minimum loss. A comparison of winding losses
   between foil windings and round conductors is also given. The analytical
   results are verified by designing six different winding configurations

Abstract = {{One of the limiting factor in the course of reducing the size of high
   frequency transformer is the temperature rise. The knowledge of
   transformer power loss is important to make an estimate of the
   temperature rise. The transformer winding loss due to a duty-cycle
   regulated square current waveform can be estimated by summing the copper
   loss due to each harmonic using Dowell's formula. The paper shows that a
   large number of harmonics have to be considered for the loss
   computation. It is shown that for solid-round wire conductors the losses
   decrease with increasing diameter and there is no optimal diameter for
   which the losses are minimum. This paper presents a closed form
   approximate expression for power loss for a particular range of
   diameters of round wire that does not require a large series summation.
   Results from this closed form expression are shown to have reasonable
   accuracy in comparison to the fourier series method and also validated
   using 2-D finite element method.}},

Abstract = {{Power electronic transformer consisting of power converters and a high
   frequency transformer (HFT) can be used to interface a low voltage
   machine to a high voltage grid. A modular multilevel converter (MMC) is
   proposed as the power converter on the high voltage side to generate
   high frequency, adjustable magnitude sinusoidal voltages. A matrix
   converter (MC) is used on the low voltage side to synthesize three-phase
   adjustable frequency PWM AC at the machine terminals. With the leakage
   inductance of the transformer, a capacitor bank forms an LC filter to
   result in sinusoidal currents through the HFT. With sinusoidal voltages
   and currents through the transformer, there is significant reduction in
   transformer losses and also natural commutation of leakage energy is
   obtained. The magnitude of the output voltage requirement by the machine
   is met by controlling the output voltage of the MMC on the primary of
   the HFT, to result in reduced voltage stress and losses in the
   transformer, secondary side converter and the machine. The operating
   principle, modulation and control of the proposed PET is validated by
   simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.}},

   available. Even though both techniques are used in the system, only one

Title = {{Aerosol Charge Fractions Downstream of Six Bipolar Chargers: Effects of
   Ion Source, Source Activity, and Flowrate}},

Abstract = {{Bipolar diffusion charging is used routinely in aerosol electrical
   mobility size distribution measurements. In this study, aerosol charge
   fractions produced by six bipolar chargers (neutralizers) were measured
   using a tandem differential mobility analyzer system. Factors that were
   studied include the type of ion source (Po-210, Kr-85, Am-241, and soft
   X-ray), source activity, charger design, and aerosol flowrate. It was
   found that all six types of neutralizers achieve stationary state charge
   distributions when the source activity is sufficiently high. For Po-210
   neutralizers with an initial radioactivity of 18.5 MBq (0.5 mCi),
   stationary state charge distributions are achieved when the source is
   less than 3.25 years old (residual activity no less than 0.0527 MBq).
   Stationary state was achieved for Kr-85 neutralizers having residual
   radioactivity greater than 70 MBq. Source activities of Am-241 and soft
   X-ray neutralizers are discussed. Aerosol charge fractions for six
   neutralizers remain reasonably invariant over a wide range of flowrates.
   The positive charge fractions achieved by the soft X-ray neutralizer are
   higher than those by the other five neutralizers using radioactive
   sources while negative charge fractions for all neutralizers studied are
   all in a similar range. This study also raises questions about bipolar
   charging fractions used for data inversion in some scanning mobility
   particle spectrometer (SMPS) systems, and underscores the need to better
   understand bipolar charging to achieve more accurate measurements of
   particle size distributions.}},

Abstract = {{In order to evaluate the survivability of airborne viruses and the
   sampling performance of an eight-stage non-viable Andersen impactor in
   typical indoor environments featuring low viral aerosol concentrations,
   aerosols of a male-specific bacteriophage (MS2), human adenovirus type 1
   (HAdV-1), and avian influenza virus (AIV) were sampled size-selectively
   using the impactor in an environmental chamber. Live virus titer, total
   virus RNA or DNA concentration, and intensity of a fluorescein tracer
   were measured to calculate relative virus recovery and virus survival.
   Viral aerosols were first sampled for 1 and 6 h at 25 degrees C and 50\%
   relative humidity (RH). Virus inactivation and plate overloading were
   found to be significant in the impactor. Viral aerosols were then
   sampled at different temperature and humidity levels. MS2 and AIV showed
   higher survival at lower temperature. Absolute humidity (AH) was found
   to be a better predictor of virus survival than RH, and the interaction
   between AH and temperature was not significant. For the tested AH range
   of 8.8 to 15.2 g/m(3), MS2 and HAdV-1 had the highest survival at the
   lowest AH while AIV had the highest survival at the highest AH. More
   than 95\% of mass collected was for particles smaller than 4.7 mu m,
   with the mass median diameter of 1.5 mu m. In the nebulizer, virus
   inactivation was not significant at 10 psi (69 kPa) compressed air
   pressure for up to 6 h of nebulization. Nebulizer analysis also reveals
   that the use of fluorescein tracer may not always accurately predict the
   physical loss of virus.}},

Pages = {{253-261}},
Abstract = {{We consider Boolean functions defined on the discrete cube \{-gamma,
   gamma(-1)\}(n) equipped with a product probability measure mu(circle
   times n), where mu = beta delta(-gamma) + alpha delta(gamma-1) and gamma
   = root alpha/beta. This normalization ensures that the coordinate
   functions (x(i)) i=1,...,n are orthonormal in L-2 (\{-gamma,
   gamma(-1)\}(n), mu(circle times n)). We prove that if the spectrum of a
   Boolean function is concentrated on the first two Fourier levels, then
   the function is close to a certain function of one variable. Our theorem
   strengthens the non-symmetric FKN Theorem due to Jendrej, Oleszkiewicz
   and Wojtaszczyk.
   Moreover, in the symmetric case alpha - beta - 1/2 we prove that if a
   {[}-1, 1]-valued function defined on the discrete cube is close to a
   certain affine function, then it is also close to a {[}-1, 1]-valued
   affine function.}},

Journal = {{IEICE ELECTRONICS EXPRESS}},
Year = {{2014}},

Abstract = {{Relay technology is necessary for Power Line Carrier communication
   because of the harsh characteristics of the power line channel,
   including time-variance, strong noise and high attenuation. The Ant
   Colony Algorithm is a promising approach for implementing relay
   technology. However, the execution time for the conventional Ant Colony
   Algorithm is very long. This paper provides a novel approach to speed up
   the search process using a database together with Dijkstra's algorithm.
   The experimental results show that the new algorithm can decrease the
   convergence time significantly in most types of topologies. In addition,
   robustness and invulnerability properties of the algorithm are also
   improved.}},

Abstract = {{This investigation is a synergistic combination of laboratory
   experimentation and numerical simulation to quantify the practical
   impact of geometric imperfections in the flow channels of a reverse
   osmosis (RO) system. To this end, carefully executed experiments are
   performed to quantify the fluid flow in a system containing feed spacers
   which are embedded in the RO membrane. In a complementary activity,
   numerical simulations were performed both for an ideal geometric
   situation (without embedments) and the actual geometric configuration
   including the embedments. It was found that the presence of unaccounted
   embedments affected the pressure drop predictions for the system by
   14-19\%. When account was taken of the embedments, the simulation
   results were found to be virtually coincident with the experimental
   results. This outcome suggests that deviations between experimental and
   simulation results encountered in the literature might well have been
   due to geometrical deviations of the type investigated here. The
   numerical simulation of the feedwater fluid flow was based on the
   often-used but unverified assumption that the velocity field experiences
   the geometric periodicity of the feed spacer. This assumption was lent
   support by results from a non-periodic simulation model and by the
   excellent agreement between the numerically based predictions and the
   experimental data.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2434}},
Pages = {{9-17}},
Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed significant efforts in developing and
   evaluating vehicle-based passive and active safety systems to reduce
   traffic accidents. In addition, there is growing interest in the use of
   microscopic simulation models for evaluating operational strategies.
   Both activities require quantitative characterization of driver behavior
   in real-world situations. Historically, such characterizations have been
   difficult to obtain, but the data available from large-scale
   naturalistic driving studies (NDS) have the potential to change this
   situation. However, identifying relevant events from an NDS database and
   reducing the NDS data to estimate relevant features of the events are
   still something of a challenge. This study used freeway brake-to-stop
   events on congested freeways as examples to describe methods for
   identifying relevant events. It then estimated event features, such as
   initial speeds for leading and following vehicles, reaction times for
   leading and following drivers, and changes in the drivers' braking
   rates. A suitably representative sample of such estimates could be used
   to support evaluation of vehicle-based safety countermeasures or provide
   inputs to traffic simulation models.}},

Abstract = {{The multi-agent distributed consensus optimization problem arises in
   many engineering applications. Recently, the alternating direction
   method of multipliers (ADMM) has been applied to distributed consensus
   optimization which, referred to as the consensus ADMM (C-ADMM), can
   converge much faster than conventional consensus subgradient methods.
   However, C-ADMM can be computationally expensive when the cost function
   to optimize has a complicated structure or when the problem dimension is
   large. In this paper, we propose an inexact C-ADMM (IC-ADMM) where each
   agent only performs one proximal gradient (PG) update at each iteration.
   The PGs are often easy to obtain especially for structured sparse
   optimization problems. Convergence conditions for IC-ADMM are analyzed.
   Numerical results based on a sparse logistic regression problem show
   that IC-ADMM, though converges slower than the original C-ADMM, has a
   considerably reduced computational complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Transmit beamforming is an effective way to enhance transmission range
   and quality of service while limiting interference to other co-channel
   systems, thus facilitating easier coexistence. Transmit beamforming
   requires channel state information to be acquired at the receiver and
   fed back to the transmitter. This in turn requires a relatively complex
   receiver, agreement on a training protocol, and a cold-start training
   period during which no payload is sent to the receiver. This article
   explores how the transmitter can learn to beamform on-the-fly from very
   low-rate channel quality indicator bits fed back from the receiver,
   while transmitting payload at the same time. The setup is tuned to
   low-latency scenarios where the receiver has limited capabilities, and
   is paired up opportunistically with the transmitter. Leveraging the
   Analytic Center Cutting Plane Method (ACCPM), an online channel
   correlation matrix learning method is developed, based on one-bit Signal
   to Noise Ratio (SNR) feedback from the receiver. The method is shown to
   asymptotically achieve the maximum possible SNR at the receiver
   (attained with perfect knowledge of the correlation matrix), starting
   from no channel state information. A Maximum Likelihood (ML) formulation
   is also developed for the case when there are feedback errors, and
   conditions for its asymptotic convergence are derived.}},

   for reliable operation of the power grid. A key challenge for accurate
   PSSE is the inherent nonlinearity of SCADA measurements in the system

   hidden convexity structure and solving a semidefinite programming (SDP)
   relaxation. In this work, an online PSSE algorithm based on SDP
   relaxation is proposed, which enjoys a similar convexity advantage,
   while capitalizing on past measurements as well for improved
   performance. An online convex optimization technique is adopted to
   derive an efficient algorithm with strong performance guarantees.

   propose an efficient distributed algorithm for the joint resource
   allocation across the wireless links and the flow control within the
   backhaul network. The proposed algorithm, which maximizes the minimum
   rate among all the users and/or flows, is based on a decomposition
   approach that leverages both the Alternating Direction Method of
   Multipliers (ADMM) and the WMMSE algorithm, and is shown to be globally

Abstract = {{Many machine learning applications employ a multiclass classification
   stage that uses multiple binary linear classifiers as building blocks.
   Among these, commonly used strategies such as one-vs-one classification
   can require learning a large number of hyperplanes, even when the number
   of classes to be discriminated among is modest. Further, when the data
   being classified is inherently high-dimensional, the storage and
   computational complexity associated with the application of multiple
   linear classifiers can ignite critical resource management issues. This
   work describes a novel multiclass classification method based on
   efficient use of a single ``recycled{''} linear classifier (or ReLiC),
   which addresses these storage and implementation complexity issues. The
   proposed approach amounts to constraining the entire collection of
   hyperplanes to be circularly-shifted versions of each other, enabling
   classification procedures that may be implemented with efficient
   operations, such as circular convolution (which can be efficiently
   computed using transform domain techniques), and simple
   sampling/thresholding operations. We show that the optimization task
   associated with our proposed approach can be formulated as a quadratic
   program, and we introduce an efficient distributed procedure for its
   solution based on an alternating direction method of multipliers.
   Simulation results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed
   approach is comparable with the more complex, traditional multiclass
   linear classification strategies, suggesting the proposed approach is a
   viable alternative in large-scale data classification tasks.}},

Abstract = {{In a heterogeneous network (HetNet) with a large number of low power

   crucial to achieving desirable system performance. In this paper, we
   consider the joint BS association and power allocation problem for an
   uplink cellular network under the max-min fairness criterion. We first
   present a binary search method whereby a QoS (Quality of Service)
   constrained subproblem is solved at each step. Then, we propose a

   original problem and prove its geometric convergence to the global

Title = {{Analysis of Spiraled-Borehole Data by Use of a Novel
   Directional-Drilling Model}},
Journal = {{SPE DRILLING \& COMPLETION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{267-278}},
Abstract = {{This paper describes the application of a directional-drilling model to
   the phenomenon of wellbore spiraling and compares its predictions with
   field data. The spiraling tendency of a bottomhole assembly (BHA) is
   determined from a stability analysis of the delay differential equations
   (DDEs) that govern the propagation of a borehole. These propagation
   equations are derived from a novel mathematical model, constructed by
   combining a bit/rock-interaction law, which relates the force and moment
   acting on the bit to its penetrations per revolution through the rock;
   kinematic relationships, which link the bit motion to the local borehole
   geometry; and a model for the BHA, which expresses the force and moment
   at the bit as a function of the external loads and the deflection
   imposed by the stabilizers. Spatial delays, associated with the
   positions of the stabilizers, account for the feedback of the borehole
   geometry as the stabilizers interact with the wellbore.
   The analytical form of the propagation equations makes it possible to
   perform a stability analysis and determine whether borehole spiraling is
   expected. The coefficients of the propagation equations embody the
   characteristics of a particular drilling system; these include the BHA
   configuration, bit properties, and the active weight Wa, a reduced
   downhole weight on bit (WOB) that depends on the actual downhole WOB,
   the state of wear of the bit, and the rock strength. If the bit
   trajectory is unstable, then any perturbation in the borehole geometry
   is amplified gradually, eventually leading to the generation of a
   spiraled hole.
   The stability of the bit trajectory essentially is controlled by the
   magnitude of a dimensionless group, a function of the lateral-steering
   resistance of the bit, the active weight, and properties of the BHA,
   relative to a critical value that depends only on the BHA configuration.
   Predictions of the stability analysis are compared with field data from
   spiral holes pertaining to eight sections from four wells drilled with
   different bit types and BHA configurations. The paper shows that the
   propensity of a BHA to spiral can be estimated by the model by assuming
   reasonable values for parameters such as the lateral-steering resistance
   and the part of the WOB transmitted by the cutter wear flats. This
   ability means that the model can be used to optimize BHA designs and
   determine critical WOB levels, both of which will mitigate the creation
   of spiraled holes.}},

Abstract = {{Our planet is experiencing simultaneous changes in global population,
   urbanization, and climate. These changes, along with the rapid growth of
   climate data and increasing popularity of data mining techniques may
   lead to the conclusion that the time is ripe for data mining to spur
   major innovations in climate science. However, climate data bring forth
   unique challenges that are unfamiliar to the traditional data mining
   literature, and unless they are addressed, data mining will not have the
   same powerful impact that it has had on fields such as biology or
   e-commerce. In this chapter, we refer to spatio-temporal data mining
   (STDM) as a collection of methods that mine the data's spatio-temporal
   context to increase an algorithm's accuracy, scalability, or
   interpretability (relative to non-space-time aware algorithms). We
   highlight some of the singular characteristics and challenges STDM faces
   within climate data and their applications, and provide the reader with
   an overview of the advances in STDM and related climate applications. We
   also demonstrate some of the concepts introduced in the chapter's
   earlier sections with a real-world STDM pattern mining application to
   identify mesoscale ocean eddies from satellite data. The case-study
   provides the reader with concrete examples of challenges faced when
   mining climate data and how effectively analyzing the data's
   spatio-temporal context may improve existing methods' accuracy,
   interpretability, and scalability. We end the chapter with a discussion
   of notable opportunities for STDM research within climate.}},

Abstract = {{The role of vascular smooth muscle architecture in the function of
   healthy and dysfunctional vessels is poorly understood. We aimed at
   determining the relationship between vascular smooth muscle architecture
   and contractile output using engineered vascular tissues. We utilized
   microcontact printing and a microfluidic cell seeding technique to
   provide three different initial seeding conditions, with the aim of
   influencing the cellular architecture within the tissue. Cells seeded in
   each condition formed confluent and aligned tissues but within the
   tissues, the cellular architecture varied. Tissues with a more elongated
   cellular architecture had significantly elevated basal stress and
   produced more contractile stress in response to endothelin-1
   stimulation. We also found a correlation between the contractile
   phenotype marker expression and the cellular architecture, contrary to
   our previous findings in non-confluent tissues. Taken with previous
   results, these data suggest that within cell-dense vascular tissues,
   smooth muscle contractility is strongly influenced by cell and tissue
   architectures.}},

Title = {{Drop motion through a confining orifice}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{759}},
Abstract = {{The motion of gravity-driven deformable drops (Bond number, B-0 similar
   to 0.8-11) through a circular confining orifice (ratio of orifice
   diameter to drop diameter, d/D < 1) was studied using high-speed
   imaging. Drops of water/glycerin, surrounded by silicone oil, fall
   toward and encounter the orifice plate after reaching terminal speed.
   The effects of surface wettability were investigated for both
   round-edged and sharp-edged orifices. For the round-edged case, a thin
   film of surrounding oil prevents the drop fluid from contacting the
   orifice surface, such that the flow outcomes of the drops are
   independent of surface wettability. For d/D < 0.8, the boundary between
   drop capture and release depends on a modified Bond number relating drop
   gravitational time scale to orifice surface tension time scale and is
   independent of viscosity ratio. Drops that release break into multiple
   fragments for larger B-0 and smaller d/D. For the sharp-edged case, a
   contact is initiated at the orifice edge immediately upon impact, such
   that surface wettability influences the drop outcome. When the surface
   is hydrophobic, the contact line motion through the orifice enhances
   penetration of the drop fluid, but the trailing interface becomes pinned
   at the orifice edge, inhibiting drop release. When the surface is
   hydrophilic, a fraction of the drop fluid is always captured because the
   drop fluid spreads on both the upper and lower plate surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{We develop a computational framework for simulating the coupled
   interaction of complex floating structures with large-scale ocean waves
   and atmospheric turbulent winds. The near-field approach features a
   partitioned fluid-structure interaction model (FSI) combining the
   curvilinear immersed boundary (CURVIB) method of Borazjani and
   Sotiropoulos (J. Comput. Phys. 2008) and the two-phase flow level set
   formulation of Kang and Sotiropoulos (Adv. in Water Res. 2012) and is
   capable of solving complex free-surface flows interacting non-linearly
   with complex real life floating structures. The near-field solver is
   coupled with a large-scale wave and wind model based on the two-fluid
   approach of Yang and Shen (J. Comput. Phys. 2011) which integrates a
   viscous Navier-Stokes solver with undulatory boundaries for the motion
   of the air and an efficient potential-flow based wave solver. The
   large-scale turbulent wind is incorporated from the far-field solver to
   the near-field solver by feeding into the latter inlet boundary
   conditions. The wave field is incorporated to the near-field solver by
   using the pressure-forcing method of Guo and Shen (J. Comput. Phys.
   2009) which has been appropriately adapted to the level set method. The
   algorithm for coupling the two codes has been validated for a variety of
   wave cases including a broadband spectrum showing excellent agreement
   when compared to theoretical results. Finally, the capabilities of the
   numerical framework are demonstrated by carrying out large eddy
   simulation (LES) of a floating wind turbine interacting with realistic
   ocean wind and wave conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The University of Minnesota Virtual Wind Simulator (VWiS) code is
   employed to simulate turbine/atmosphere interactions in the Scaled Wind
   Farm Technology (SWiFT) facility developed by Sandia National
   Laboratories in Lubbock, TX, USA. The facility presently consists of
   three turbines and the simulations consider the case of wind blowing
   from South such that two turbines are in the free stream and the third
   turbine in the direct wake of one upstream turbine with separation of 5
   rotor diameters. Large-eddy simulation (LES) on two successively finer
   grids is carried out to examine the sensitivity of the computed
   solutions to grid refinement. It is found that the details of the
   break-up of the tip vortices into small-scale turbulence structures can
   only be resolved on the finer grid. It is also shown that the power
   coefficient C-p of the downwind turbine predicted on the coarse grid is

Abstract = {{Native coenzymes such as the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
   (NADH) and oxidized flavin adenine dinucleotide play pivotal roles in
   energy metabolism and a myriad of biochemical reactions in living
   cells/tissues. These coenzymes are naturally fluorescent and, therefore,
   have the potential to serve as intrinsic biomarkers for mitochondrial
   activities, programmed cell death (apoptosis), oxidative stress, aging,
   and neurodegenerative disease. In this contribution, we employ
   two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and
   time-resolved anisotropy imaging of intracellular NADH for quantitative,
   non-invasive biochemistry on living cells in response to
   hydrogen-peroxide-induced oxidative stress. In contrast with
   steady-state one-photon, UV-excited autofluorescence, two-photon FLIM is
   sensitive to both molecular conformation and stimuli-induced changes in
   the local environment in living cells with minimum photodamage and
   inherently enhanced spatial resolution. On the other hand,
   time-resolved, two-photon anisotropy imaging of cellular
   autofluorescence allows for quantitative assessment of binding state and
   environmental restrictions on the tumbling mobility of intrinsic NADH.
   Our measurements reveal that free and enzyme-bound NADH exist at
   equilibrium, with a dominant autofluorescence contribution of the bound
   fraction in living cells. Parallel studies on NADH-enzyme binding in
   controlled environments serve as a point of reference in analyzing
   autofluorescence in living cells. These autofluorescence-based
   approaches complement the conventional analytical biochemistry methods
   that require the destruction of cells/tissues, while serving as an
   important step towards establishing intracellular NADH as a natural
   biomarker for monitoring changes in energy metabolism and redox state of
   living cells in response to environmental hazards.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to create and evaluate a smart composite
   structure that can be used for integrated load sensing and structural
   health monitoring. In this structure, PVDF films are used as the matrix
   material instead of epoxy resin or other thermoplastics. The
   reinforcements are two layers of carbon fiber with one layer of Kevlar
   separating them. Due to the electrical conductivity properties of carbon
   fiber and the dielectric effect of Kevlar, the structure acts as a
   capacitor. Furthermore, the piezoelectric properties of the PVDF matrix
   can be used to monitor the response of the structure under applied
   loads. In order to exploit the piezoelectric properties of PVDF, the
   PVDF material must be polarized to align the dipole moments of its
   crystalline structure. The optimal condition for poling the structure
   was found by performing a 23 factorial design of experiment (DoE). The
   factors that were studied in DoE were temperature, voltage, and duration
   of poling. Finally, the response of the poled structure was monitored by
   exposing the samples to an applied load.}},

Abstract = {{We combine experiments and distinct element method simulations to
   understand the stability of rings and rackets formed by single-walled
   carbon nanotubes assembled into ropes. Bending remains a soft
   deformation mode in ropes because intra-rope sliding of the constituent
   nanotubes occurs with ease. Our simulations indicate that the formation
   of these aggregates can be attributed to the mesoscopic mechanics of
   entangled nanotubes and to the sliding at the contacts. Starting from
   the single-walled carbon nanotubes, the sizes of the rings and rackets'
   heads increase with the rope diameter, indicating that the stability of
   the experimental aggregates can be largely explained by the competition
   between bending and van der Waals adhesion energies. Our results and
   simulation method should be useful for understanding nanoscale fibers in
   general.}},

Abstract = {{Electrodeposition of gold from a basic ``fresh{''} and ``used{''}
   thiosulfate-sulfite solution containing 0.02 M Na3Au(S2O3)(2) has been
   investigated on Au and Pt electrodes using various electroanalytical
   techniques (CV, LSV, RDE), controlled potential electrodeposition, as
   well as constant current and pulse current deposition. It was proposed
   that irreversible one electron reduction to gold-run in ``fresh{''}
   solution-at the Pt electrode starts from Au(S2O3)(SO3)(2)(5-), a mixed
   gold thiosulfate-sulfite complex with a high stability constant (log
   beta = 30.8). A diffusion coefficient of 1.77 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s for Au
   (S2O3) (SO3)(2)(5-) was calculated from the slope of the linear plot
   i(p)- nu(1/2) obtained with a Pt electrode, which is lower than the
   value of diffusion coefficient (D = 4.6 x 10(-6) cm(2)/s) obtained for
   the Au (S2O3)(2)(3-) complex (log beta = 26.0) present in the ``used{''}
   solution. The voltammograms for gold deposition on the Au electrode were
   significantly different from those on Pt indicating that the electron
   transfer was influenced by the coupled chemical reaction. The natures of
   possible chemical reactions are discussed. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

Title = {{Effect of pattern complexity on the visual span for Chinese and alphabet
   characters}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VISION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{8}},
Abstract = {{The visual span for reading is the number of letters that can be
   recognized without moving the eyes and is hypothesized to impose a
   sensory limitation on reading speed. Factors affecting the size of the
   visual span have been studied using alphabet letters. There may be
   common constraints applying to recognition of other scripts. The aim of
   this study was to extend the concept of the visual span to Chinese
   characters and to examine the effect of the greater complexity of these
   characters. We measured visual spans for Chinese characters and alphabet
   letters in the central vision of bilingual subjects. Perimetric
   complexity was used as a metric to quantify the pattern complexity of
   binary character images. The visual span tests were conducted with four
   sets of stimuli differing in complexity-lowercase alphabet letters and
   three groups of Chinese characters. We found that the size of visual
   spans decreased with increasing complexity, ranging from 10.5 characters
   for alphabet letters to 4.5 characters for the most complex Chinese
   characters studied. A decomposition analysis revealed that crowding was
   the dominant factor limiting the size of the visual span, and the amount
   of crowding increased with complexity. Errors in the spatial arrangement
   of characters (mislocations) had a secondary effect. We conclude that
   pattern complexity has a major effect on the size of the visual span,
   mediated in large part by crowding. Measuring the visual span for
   Chinese characters is likely to have high relevance to understanding
   visual constraints on Chinese reading performance.}},

   Evaluation of Signal Coordination}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},

Pages = {{94-104}},
Abstract = {{The time space (TS) diagram is a popular visualization tool in
   evaluating progression quality for signalized arterials, and most signal
   optimization software products (such as Synchro) can generate TS
   diagrams as part of the optimization output. During the signal retiming
   process, TS diagrams generated by optimization software need to be
   validated by field observations, and minor changes will be made to
   signal control parameters if a discrepancy is observed. The validation
   process is time-consuming and costly. Through the use of high-resolution
   event-based traffic data collected from existing traffic signal
   controllers, a practical procedure for constructing TS diagrams for
   signalized arterials is proposed. The diagrams can be used as a
   convenient visualization tool in evaluating the performance of traffic
   signals and in identifying opportunities for fine-tuning in a timely
   manner. Reasonable agreement was found between the TS diagram and
   vehicle trajectory data collected from the field. A field experiment was
   carried out to illustrate how signal parameter changes could be made by
   intuitive evaluation of the TS diagram. Recommendations and limitations
   of the proposed approach are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Wireless power transfer technology is considered as one of the promising
   solutions to address the energy limitation problems for end-devices, but
   its incurred potential risk of electromagnetic radiation (EMR) exposure
   is largely overlooked by most existing works. In this paper, we consider
   the Safe Charging with Adjustable PowEr (SCAPE) problem, namely, how to
   adjust the power of chargers to maximize the charging utility of
   devices, while assuring that EMR intensity at any location in the field
   does not exceed a given threshold R-t. We present novel techniques to
   reformulate SCAPE into a traditional linear programming problem, and
   then remove its redundant constraints as much as possible to reduce
   computational effort. Next, we propose a distributed algorithm with
   provable approximation ratio (1 - epsilon). Through extensive simulation
   and testbed experiments, we demonstrate that our (1 -
   epsilon)-approximation algorithm outperforms the Set-Cover algorithm by
   up to 23\%, and has an average performance gain of 41.1\% over the SCP
   algorithm in terms of the overall charging utility.}},

   constrained to meet 100\% of the energy demand. An optimal design is
   found to minimize the cost of energy supply over a 20 year lifespan. The
   optimal design is analysed with respect to technology cost and
   environmental policy in the form of CO2 taxation. Use of combined heat
   and power is found to lower cost of energy supply in all cases. CO2
   taxation is found to be ineffective in promoting greener power supply

Pages = {{58-67}},
Abstract = {{The physical properties of the aggregate base of a pavement system have
   a significant influence on the bulk mechanical properties of that
   system. Simulations based on the discrete element method provide a
   powerful method to investigate the mechanics of granular materials, but
   they are limited, particularly when it comes to representing moisture
   and finer particles. Established discrete element method simulations
   were adapted with additional terms to account for moisture and finer
   particles to model established tests of the aggregate base of a pavement
   system. The presence of moisture in unsaturated granular material was
   modeled by using published experimental work with consideration of the
   form of the standard liquid bridge model, and the finer particle content
   was modeled through an effective friction coefficient. This combined
   model was used to simulate the lightweight deflectometer test, an
   established in situ test for a measure of the modulus of an aggregate
   base, and the results were compared with estimated target values of
   aggregate bases for Minnesota roads. When either the model moisture
   content or model fines content was increased systematically, there was a
   decrease in the elastic modulus computed from the simulations, similar
   to trends seen in existing experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Deflection testing and analysis are routinely used to evaluate the
   spring load capacity of pavements and to design structural overlays. The
   current falling-weight deflectometer (FWD) deflection analysis process
   used by the Minnesota Department of Transportation was found to be
   unreliable. Traditionally, the process used to interpret FWD deflection
   measurements converted the measured maximum FWD deflection to an
   equivalent Benkelman beam deflection and compared it with the allowable
   deflection for a pavement with given asphalt surface thickness and
   anticipated traffic. Because the maximum FWD deflection is greatly
   affected by the subgrade stiffness, the computer program TONN may
   underestimate the allowable axle load for subgrades depending on the
   subgrade material. As a result, the researchers determined that the
   allowable axle load rating procedure-should be revised. Those revisions
   and the development of a new rating procedure for low-volume roads are
   detailed.}},

Abstract = {{Genetic interactions occur when mutant alleles of two or more genes
   collaborate to generate an unusual composite phenotype, one that would
   not be predicted based on the expected combined effects of the
   individual mutant alleles. Synthetic Genetic Array (SGA) methodology was
   developed to automate yeast genetic analysis and enable systematic
   genetic interaction studies. In its simplest form, SGA consists of a
   series of replica pinning steps, which enable the construction of
   haploid double mutants through mating and meiotic recombination. For
   example, a strain carrying a query mutation, such as a deletion allele
   of a nonessential gene or a conditional temperature sensitive allele of
   an essential gene, could be crossed to an input array of yeast mutants,
   such as the complete set of similar to 5,000 viable deletion mutants, to
   generate an output array of double mutants, that can be scored for
   genetic interactions based on estimates of cellular fitness derived from
   colony-size measurements. A simple quantitative measure of genetic
   interactions can be derived from colony size, which serves as a proxy
   for fitness. Furthermore, SGA can be applied in a variety of other
   contexts, such as Synthetic Dosage Lethality (SDL), in which a query
   mutation is crossed into an array of yeast strains, each of which
   overexpresses a different gene, thus making use of SGA to probe for
   gain-of-function phenotypes in specific genetic backgrounds.
   High-Content Screening (HCS) also integrates SGA to perform genome-wide
   screens for quantitative analysis of morphological phenotypes or pathway
   activity based upon fluorescent markers, extending genetic interaction
   analysis beyond fitness-based measurements. Genetic interaction studies
   offer insight into gene function, pathway structure, and buffering, and

Abstract = {{In this study, human foreskin fibroblasts and mouse embryonic
   fibroblasts were encapsulated in mechanically reversible, THEOS and
   THEOS-PEG gels that completely immobilized them restricting their
   motility, growth and proliferation. The changes in the membrane
   integrity and metabolic activity (MA) of the immobilized cells were
   measured by IR spectroscopy and fluorescence microscopy. To explore the
   effects of surface chemistry and porosity on immobilized cell MA,
   different amounts of a biocompatible polymer, polyethylene glycol PEG,
   was incorporated into the silica gels. To explore the effects of the
   proliferative stress, in selected experiments, cellular proliferation
   was arrested prior to immobilization by exposing the cells to
   irradiation. Four main factors were identified that affect the long-term
   survival of the cells within the immobilization matrix: (1)
   porosity/permeability of the gel, (2) structural homogeneity of the gel,
   (3) specific interactions between the cell membrane and the gel surface
   and (4) the proliferative stress. It was shown that the immobilized
   cells could easily be mechanically recovered from the gel and upon
   incubation, proliferated normally. It is believed that the gels and the
   matrix developed here have very significant potential applications in
   tissue engineering and in personalized cancer treatment.}},

   alternatives whose goal is to reduce computational cost and storage

Abstract = {{Motivated by applications in wireless communications, this paper
   develops semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation techniques for some
   mixed binary quadratically constrained quadratic programs (MBQCQP) and
   analyzes their approximation performance. We consider both a
   minimization and a maximization model of this problem. For the
   minimization model, the objective is to find a minimum norm vector in
   N-dimensional real or complex Euclidean space, such that M concave
   quadratic constraints and a cardinality constraint are satisfied with
   both binary and continuous variables. By employing a special randomized
   rounding procedure, we show that the ratio between the norm of the
   optimal solution of the minimization model and its SDP relaxation is
   upper bounded by O(Q(2)(M - Q + 1) + M-2) in the real case and by O(M(M
   - Q + 1)) in the complex case. For the maximization model, the goal is
   to find a maximum norm vector subject to a set of quadratic constraints
   and a cardinality constraint with both binary and continuous variables.
   We show that in this case the approximation ratio is bounded from below
   by O(epsilon/ln(M)) for both the real and the complex cases where
   epsilon > 0 is a model parameter. Moreover, this ratio is tight up to a
   constant factor.}},

   Here we have developed a novel Spinning-Langmuir-Filmtechnique to
   fulfill both requirements. We used surfactant-enhanced shear flow to
   align inorganic and organic nanowires, which could be easily transferred
   to other substrates and ready for device fabrication in less than 20
   minutes. The aligned nanowire areal density can be controlled in a wide
   range from 16/mm(-2) to 258/ mm(-2), through the compression of the
   film. The surface surfactant layer significantly influences the quality
   of alignment and has been investigated in detail.}},

Abstract = {{A series of donor-acceptor statistical copolymers based on a
   2,7-divinyl-9,9'-di-n-hexylfluorene (FV) donor and
   4,7-bis(4-hexadecyl-5-propenyl-2-thienyl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazole (TBTV)
   acceptor were prepared to investigate the relationship between copolymer
   donor-acceptor ratio and organic solar cell (OSC) performance.
   Homopolymers of the donor and acceptor moieties were prepared by acyclic
   diene metathesis (ADMET) methods. Five copolymers with systematically
   varied donor-acceptor ratios spanning the entire composition range were
   also prepared. All homopolymers and copolymers were characterized using
   size exclusion chromatography, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy,
   ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, and electrochemical cyclic
   voltammetry. Additionally, each polymer was incorporated into thin film
   field effect transistor and photovoltaic devices to investigate
   optoelectronic properties. The highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)
   level was found to be tunable over a 600 meV range through systematic
   variation of the copolymer donor-acceptor ratio. This same tunability
   manifested in the solar cell open circuit voltage (V-oc), which also
   varied over a 600 mV range. Short circuit current density (J(sc))
   correlated well with field effect hole mobility. This series exemplifies
   the relationship between copolymer composition, HOMO energy level, and
   V-oc, and demonstrates that peak solar cell performance can be achieved
   at non-stoichiometric donor-acceptor compositions.}},

Abstract = {{Increasingly, location-aware datasets are of a size, variety, and update
   rate that exceeds the capability of spatial computing technologies. This
   paper addresses the emerging challenges posed by such datasets, which we
   call Spatial Big Data (SBD). SBD examples include trajectories of
   cell-phones and GPS devices, vehicle engine measurements, temporally
   detailed road maps, etc. SBD has the potential to transform society via
   a number of new technologies including next-generation routing services.
   However, the envisaged SBD-based services pose several significant
   challenges for current spatial computing techniques. SBD magnifies the
   impact of partial information and ambiguity of traditional routing
   queries specified by a start location and an end location. In addition,
   SBD challenges the assumption that a single algorithm utilizing a
   specific dataset is appropriate for all situations. The tremendous
   diversity of SBD sources substantially increases the diversity of
   solution methods. Newer algorithms may emerge as new SBD becomes
   available, creating the need for a flexible architecture to rapidly
   integrate new datasets and associated algorithms. To quantify the
   performance of these new algorithms, new benchmarks are needed that
   focus on these spatial big datasets to ensure proper comparisons across
   techniques.}},

Title = {{The extraboard operator scheduling and work assignment problem}},
Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{46}},
Number = {{11, SI}},
Pages = {{1132-1146}},
Abstract = {{An instance of the operational fixed job scheduling problem arises when
   open work caused by unplanned events such as bus breakdowns, inclement
   weather, and driver (operator) absenteeism need to be covered by reserve
   (extraboard) drivers. Each workpiece, which is referred to as a job,
   requires one operator who must work continuously between specified start
   and end times to complete the job. Each extraboard operator may be
   assigned up to w hours of work, which may not to be continuous so long
   as the total work time is within a s-hour time window of that operator's
   shift start time. Parameters w and s are called allowable work-time and
   spread-time, respectively. The objective is to choose operators' shift
   start times and work assignments, while honoring work-time and
   spread-time constraints, such that the amount of work covered as part of
   regular duties is maximized. This paper argues that the extraboard
   operator scheduling problem is NP-hard and three heuristic approaches
   are presented for the solution of such problems. These include a
   decomposition-based algorithm whose worst-case performance ratio is
   proved to lie in {[}1 - 1/e, 19/27], where e approximate to 2:718 is the
   base of the natural logarithm. Numerical experiments are presented that
   use data from a large transit agency, which show that the average
   performance of the decomposition algorithm is good when applied to
   real-world data.}},

Abstract = {{With increasing process parameter variations in nanometre regime,
   circuits and systems encounter significant performance variations and
   therefore statistical analysis has become increasingly important. For
   complex analog and mixed-signal circuits and systems, efficient yet
   accurate statistical analysis has been a challenge mainly due to
   significant simulation and modelling time. In the past years, there have
   been various approaches proposed for statistical analysis of analog and
   mixed-signal circuits. A recent work is reported to address statistical
   analysis for continuous-time Delta-Sigma modulators. In this article, we
   generalise that method and present a hierarchical method for efficient
   statistical analysis of complex analog and mixed-signal circuits while
   maintaining reasonable accuracy. At circuit level, we use the response
   surface modelling method to extract quadratic models of circuit-level
   performance parameters in terms of process parameters. Then at system
   level, we use behavioural models and apply the Monte-Carlo method for
   statistical evaluation of system performance parameters. We illustrate
   and validate the method on a continuous-time Delta-Sigma modulator and
   an analog filter.}},

Title = {{Regression Modeling of Ozonation Process in Wastewater Treatment Plants
   for Reduction of Waste Activated Sludge}},
Journal = {{OZONE-SCIENCE \& ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{451-464}},
Abstract = {{This research was based on the hypothesis that waste activated sludge
   (WAS) from municipal wastewater treatment plants can be reduced by
   ozonation of excess biosolids to induce cell lysis and by promoting
   utilization of intracellular products released by ozonation of biosolids
   in the aeration basins. In this research, mathematical modeling studies
   were performed in order to define process design and major components of
   ozonation. The main purpose of the model simulations was to evaluate the
   effect of operational parameters of the ozonation system (such as dosage
   and duration of ozonation) and to determine the amount of solids to be
   ozonated in order to achieve desired mass reductions in WAS. This
   modeling study focused on identification of design parameters and their
   suggested range of operation. The model presented in this study does not
   intend to detail and analyze the impact of the scientific variables in
   the ozonation mechanism, nor does it try to model the biosolids
   destruction mechanisms when ozonation is applied. The computer model
   simulations indicated that zero biosolids yield conditions can be
   achieved if more biosolids than was grown on the influent wastewater was
   processed through the ozonation system. The simulations suggested that
   zero biosolids yield conditions can be observed if 2.4 times as much
   biosolids as was grown on the influent wastewater was processed through
   the ozonation column, with a daily R of about 0.08 mg O-3/mg TSS-day.
   Furthermore, zero biosolids yield conditions can also be observed if
   only the amount of waste biosolids grown on the influent wastewater was
   processed through the ozonation column with a higher average daily R of
   0.2 mg O-3/mg TSS-day.}},

Title = {{Generating Reliable Freight Performance Measures with Truck GPS Data
   Case Study in Twin Cities Metropolitan Area, Minnesota}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2014}},
Number = {{2410}},
Pages = {{21-30}},
Abstract = {{Building on previous efforts to study freight mobility and reliability,
   a truck GPS data analysis methodology was developed to study the freight
   performance of heavy commercial vehicles along key freight corridors in
   the Twin Cities metropolitan area in Minnesota. Twelve months of truck
   GPS data collected in 2012 were obtained from the American
   Transportation Research Institute. Several performance measures, such as
   truck mobility, delay, and reliability measures, were derived and
   statistically analyzed by route, roadway segment, and time of day. The
   derived performance measures were validated with available benchmark
   data to ensure data quality. Data quality validation is important
   particularly in urban areas where satellite reception may be limited and
   traffic congestion is more common. For data quality verification,
   average truck speed and hourly volume percentage computed from the truck
   GPS data were validated with data from weigh-in-motion sensors, loop
   detectors, and automatic traffic recorders at selected locations. The
   analysis methodology using truck GPS data offers potential opportunities
   for freight planners and managers to generate reliable measures in a
   timely manner. Findings from this research indicate that those measures
   derived from the truck GPS data can be used in supporting the U.S.
   Department of Transportation performance measure initiative and truck
   and freight modeling in metropolitan areas. The performance measures can
   provide truck-specific information to support regional surface freight
   planners in identifying freight bottlenecks and infrastructure
   improvement needs and in developing operational strategies to promote
   efficient freight movement for the industry.}},

Title = {{Detailed Shoulder MRI Findings in Manual Wheelchair Users with Shoulder
   Pain}},
Journal = {{BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Shoulder pain and pathology are common in manual wheelchair (MWC) users
   with paraplegia, and the biomechanical mechanism of injury is largely
   unknown. Establishing patterns of MRI characteristics in MWC users would
   help advance understanding of the mechanical etiology of rotator cuff
   disease, thus improving the logic for prescribed interventions. The
   purpose of this study was to report detailed shoulder MRI findings in a
   sample of 10 MWC users with anterolateral shoulder pain. The imaging
   assessments were performed using our standardized MRI Assessment of the
   Shoulder (MAS) guide. The tendon most commonly torn was the
   supraspinatus at the insertion site in the anterior portion in either
   the intrasubstance or articular region. Additionally, widespread
   tendinopathy, CA ligament thickening, subacromial bursitis, labral
   tears, and AC joint degenerative arthrosis and edema were common.
   Further reporting of detailed shoulder imaging findings is needed to
   confirm patterns of tears in MWC users regarding probable tendon tear
   zone, region, and portion. This investigation was a small sample
   observational study and did not yield data that can define patterns of
   pathology. However, synthesis of detailed findings from multiple studies
   could define patterns of pathological MRI findings allowing for
   associations of imaging findings to risk factors including specific
   activities.}},

Pages = {{93-99}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the results of an investigation into the factors
   contributing to toll lane subscription choice by using data from the
   MnPASS high-occupancy toll lane system operated by the Minnesota
   Department of Transportation. The paper estimates a binomial logit model
   that predicts, on the basis of aggregate characteristics of the
   surrounding area, the likelihood of a household having a subscription to
   MnPASS systems. Variables in this model include demographic factors as
   well as an estimate of the incremental accessibility benefit provided by
   the MnPASS system. This benefit is estimated with the use of detailed
   accessibility calculations and represents the degree to which a
   location's accessibility to jobs is improved if HOT lanes are available.
   The model achieves a p(2) value of .634, and analysis of the results
   suggests that incremental accessibility benefits play a statistically
   and practically significant role in determining how likely households
   are to hold a toll lane subscription.}},

Title = {{The Single-Fiber Collision Rate and Filtration Efficiency for
   Nanoparticles I: The First-Passage Time Calculation Approach}},
Journal = {{AEROSOL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{875-885}},
Abstract = {{We describe an approach to filtration-efficiency calculations as an
   alternative to the traditional depth filtration theory. The new approach
   involves linking the single-fiber efficiency to the collision rate
   coefficient/kernel between nanoparticles and fibers, and correspondingly
   inferring the collision kernel via dimensionless mean first-passage time
   (MFPT) calculations. This method has the advantage of easily
   incorporating the influences of particle diffusion, inertia, and
   particle size; therefore, all filtration mechanisms can be considered
   simultaneously. Through non-dimensionalization of the equation of motion
   for a particle in MFPT calculations (the Langevin equation), it is shown
   that both the single-fiber efficiency E-f and dimensionless
   particle-fiber collision kernel, H, are functions of the ratio of
   particle radius to filter-fiber radius, R, the solid volume fraction in
   the filter, V-f, the ratio of particle persistence distance to the
   particle-filter collision distance, Kn(D) (the diffusive Knudsen
   number), and the ratio of the particle translational kinetic energy to
   the thermal energy chi(f). Using a Kuwabara flow-cell model to define
   the geometry and flow field, MFPT calculations are used to determine H
   and E-f for nanoparticles in atmospheric pressure systems, i.e., when
   particle inertia is negligible but when diffusion and interception act
   in tandem to collect particles. From MFPT results, regression equations
   for both H and E-f are developed. A comparison is made between MFPT
   results and commonly invoked depth-filtration single-fiber efficiency
   relationships, experimentally measured values, and H equations derived
   from Sherwood number correlations based upon measurements of heat
   transfer from a fluid flowing perpendicular to an array of cylinders.
   Good agreement is found with both measurements and previously developed
   equations over a wide range of parameter space.}},

   Knudsen number (Kn(D)). Regression equations are provided to calculate
   this length scale for quasifractal aggregates of varying fractal
   dimension, as well as cylinders. MFPT calculations reveal that, over
   similar to 5 orders of magnitude in H, these regression equations for
   the collision length are valid. Furthermore, using the previously
   attained proportionality between the predicted dimensionless collision
   rate and the single-fiber efficiency, comparison is made between the
   equations presented here and measurements of the penetration of both
   multiwalled carbon nanotubes and quasifractal aggregates through fibrous
   filters. Reasonable agreement is found between measured and predicted
   single-fiber efficiencies in both circumstances, supporting the use of
   the single-fiber efficiency calculation approach we developed.}},

Abstract = {{A new strength test method for asphalt mixture at low temperatures is

   Rheometer (BBR), capable of applying loads at different rates. Two major
   factors, that can significantly affect strength, were analysed: cooling
   medium and specimen size. Similar strength values were obtained in air
   and potassium acetate and significantly lower values were obtained in
   ethanol. Preliminary investigation with sodium fluorescein (FL)
   indicates the fluorescing marker diffused in mixtures when ethanol was
   used. The failure distributions of BBR mixture beams and of larger beams
   (LBs) were analysed using histogram testing and size effect theory.
   Different Weibull moduli were obtained for BBR and for the LB, which
   indicates that BBR beams may be too small to capture the representative
   volume element of the material.}},

Journal = {{CATALYSIS SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{2340-2352}},
Abstract = {{Vapor phase hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of furfural over Mo2C catalysts at
   low temperatures (423 K) and ambient pressure showed high/low
   selectivity to C=O bond/C-C bond cleavage, resulting in selectivity to
   2-methylfuran (2MF) and furan of similar to 50-60\% and <1\%,
   respectively. Efficient usage of H-2 for deoxygenation, instead of
   unwanted sequential hydrogenation, was evidenced by the low selectivity
   to 2-methyltetrahydrofuran. The apparent activation energy and H-2 order
   for 2MF production rates were both found to be invariant with furfural
   conversion caused by catalyst deactivation, suggesting that (1) the
   measured reaction kinetics are not influenced by the products of
   furfural HDO and (2) the loss of active sites, presumably by formation
   of carbonaceous species observed by TEM analysis, is the reason for the
   observed catalyst deactivation. The observed half order dependence of
   2MF production rates on H-2 pressure at different furfural pressures
   (similar to 0.12-0.96 kPa) and the 0-0.3 order dependence in furfural
   pressure support the idea of two distinct sites required for vapor phase
   furfural HDO reactions on Mo2C catalysts. The invariance of 2MF
   production rates normalized by the number of catalytic centers assessed
   via ex situ CO chemisorption suggests that metal-like sites on Mo2C
   catalysts are involved in selective HDO reactions.}},

   simple bulk heterojunction}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY A}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{31}},
Pages = {{12397-12402}},
Abstract = {{Efficient organic photovoltaic cells (OPVs) based on vapor-deposited
   small molecule materials frequently utilize a planar-mixed
   heterojunction (PMHJ) architecture, in which a mixed layer of electron
   donating and accepting materials is sandwiched between neat, planar
   layers of the donor and acceptor. The neat layers contribute to
   photocurrent, help minimize the dark current and maximize the device
   open-circuit voltage. The use of organic semiconductors as the planar
   layers is not however without complication, as the low charge carrier
   mobility in these materials can hinder efficient charge collection. In
   this work, we examine OPVs where the neat donor layer between the anode
   and the mixture is replaced with a layer of MoOx. An average device
   power conversion efficiency of (7.7 +/- 0.3)\% is realized under AM1.5G
   (100 mW cm(-2)) solar simulated illumination in a uniformly mixed
   heterojunction OPV based on the donor-acceptor pairing of 2-\{{[}7-(4-N,
   N-ditolylaminophenylen-1-yl)-2,1,3-benzothiadiazol-4-yl] methylene\}
   malononitrile (DTDCPB)-C-70 without any adjacent donor or acceptor
   layers. Correcting for spectral mismatch, an average device power
   conversion efficiency of (7.9 +/- 0.3)\% is obtained, with a champion
   device efficiency of 8.2\%. The use of MoOx versus a neat donor layer is
   found to reduce the series resistance and facilitate charge collection
   from the mixed layer, leading to an increased fill factor and
   short-circuit current. To our knowledge, this result is among the
   highest single-cell efficiencies reported for vapor-deposited small
   molecule OPVs. We further find that mixed OPVs based on DTDCPB-C-70
   exhibit a promising shelf lifetime, showing no degradation in efficiency
   after more than seven months. Thus, the removal of the neat planar
   organic layer can favorably affect device efficiency without potentially
   adversely impacting stability.}},

Title = {{Broad metabolic sensitivity profiling of a prototrophic yeast deletion
   collection}},
Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Genome-wide sensitivity screens in yeast have been immensely
   popular following the construction of a collection of deletion mutants
   of non-essential genes. However, the auxotrophic markers in this
   collection preclude experiments on minimal growth medium, one of the
   most informative metabolic environments. Here we present quantitative
   growth analysis for mutants in all 4,772 non-essential genes from our
   prototrophic deletion collection across a large set of metabolic
   conditions.
   Results: The complete collection was grown in environments consisting of
   one of four possible carbon sources paired with one of seven nitrogen
   sources, for a total of 28 different well-defined metabolic
   environments. The relative contributions to mutants' fitness of each
   carbon and nitrogen source were determined using multivariate
   statistical methods. The mutant profiling recovered known and novel
   genes specific to the processing of nutrients and accurately predicted
   functional relationships, especially for metabolic functions. A
   benchmark of genome-scale metabolic network modeling is also given to
   demonstrate the level of agreement between current in silico predictions
   and hitherto unavailable experimental data.
   Conclusions: These data address a fundamental deficiency in our
   understanding of the model eukaryote Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its
   response to the most basic of environments. While choice of carbon
   source has the greatest impact on cell growth, specific effects due to
   nitrogen source and interactions between the nutrients are frequent. We
   demonstrate utility in characterizing genes of unknown function and
   illustrate how these data can be integrated with other whole-genome
   screens to interpret similarities between seemingly diverse perturbation
   types.}},

Abstract = {{Collections of tumour genomes created by insertional mutagenesis
   experiments, e.g., the Retroviral Tagged Cancer Gene Database (RTCGD),
   can be analysed to find connections between mutations of specific genes
   and cancer. Such connections are found by identifying the locations of
   insertions or groups of insertions that frequently occur in the
   collection of tumour genomes. Recent work has employed a kernel density
   approach to find such commonly occurring insertions or co-occurring
   pairs of insertions. Unfortunately, this approach is extremely compute
   intensive for pairs of insertions and even more intractable for triples,
   etc. We present a technique that can efficiently find commonly
   co-occurring sets of insertions (or other genomic features) of any

Abstract = {{A model-reduction method for linear, parameter-varying systems based on
   parameter-varying balanced realizations is proposed for a body freedom
   flutter vehicle. A high-order linear, parameter-varying model with
   hundreds of states describes the coupling between the short period and
   first bending mode with additional structural bending and torsion modes
   that couple with the rigid body dynamics. However, these high-order
   state space models result in a challenging control design, and hence a
   reduced-order linear, parameter-varying model is desired. The objective
   is to reduce the model state order across the flight envelope while
   retaining a common set of states in the linear, parameter-varying model.
   A reduced-order linear, parameter-varying model with tens of states is
   obtained by combining classical model reduction and parameter-varying
   balanced realizations reduction techniques. The resulting reduced-order
   model captures the unstable dynamics of the vehicle and is well suited
   for the synthesis of active flutter suppression controllers.}},

Abstract = {{Activatable photoacoustic probes have a promising future due to their
   ability to provide high-resolution, high-penetration depth information
   on enzyme activity in vivo. Spectral identification methods, however,
   suffer from heterogeneous optical properties and wavelength-dependent
   light attenuation in tissue, thereby limiting the effective suppression
   of background noise signal. Our approach is predicated on probing the
   excited-state lifetime of a dual-labeled methylene blue (MB) probe that
   changes its lifetime from short to long upon cleavage. Recently, we have
   reported on the ability of our system to probe the long triplet lifetime
   of free MB monomers in solution and to differentiate between monomers
   and dimers based on their lifetime contrast. Here we introduce an
   improvement to our system that significantly increases the system
   sensitivity to fast changes, and reduces the minimum resolvable lifetime
   down to a few nanoseconds. We applied this method to probe the
   excited-state lifetime of a covalently coupled dual methylene
   blue-lysine conjugate (MB2K) in a mixed MB/MB2K solution. Preliminary
   results show that a stable dimeric bond is formed between the
   chromophores within the conjugate, and that this conjugate is statically
   quenched. Examination of the transient absorption of MB2K reveals it
   does not exhibit a triplet excited-state lifetime, suggesting that it
   undergoes a fast deexcitation process directly from the singlet state.
   Finally, we demonstrate how the transient photoacoustic lifetime signal
   can be used to selectively detect the presence of MB monomers while
   improving background noise suppression by differentiating the lifetime
   of free MB dye with other absorbing structures.}},

Abstract = {{Tissue oxygen plays a critical role in maintaining tissue viability and
   in various diseases, including response to therapy. Images of oxygen
   distribution provide the history of tissue hypoxia and evidence of
   oxygen availability in the circulatory system. Currently available
   methods of direct measuring or imaging tissue oxygen all have
   significant limitations. Previously, we have reported a non-invasive in
   vivo imaging modality based on photoacoustic lifetime. The technique
   maps the excited triplet state of oxygen-sensitive dye, thus reflects
   the spatial and temporal distribution of tissue oxygen. We have applied
   PALI on tumor hypoxia in small animals, and the hypoxic region imaged by
   PALI is consistent with the site of the tumor imaged by ultrasound.
   Here, we present two studies of applying PALI to monitor changes of
   tissue oxygen by modulations. The first study involves an acute ischemia
   model using a thin thread tied around the hind limb of a normal mouse to
   reduce the blood flow. PALI images were acquired before, during, and
   after the restriction. The drop of muscle pO(2) and recovery from
   hypoxia due to reperfusion were observed by PALI tracking the same
   region. The second study modulates tissue oxygen by controlling the
   percentage of oxygen the mouse inhales.
   We demonstrate that PALI is able to reflect the change of oxygen level
   with respect to both hyperbaric and hypobaric conditions. We expect this
   technique to be very attractive for a range of clinical applications in
   which tissue oxygen mapping would improve therapy decision making and
   treatment planning.}},

Abstract = {{Our laboratory utilized biomimicry to develop a synthetic bone scaffold
   based on hydroxyapatite-gelatin-calcium silicate (HGCS). Here, we
   evaluated the potential of HGCS scaffold in bone formation in vivo using
   the rat calvarial critical-sized defect (CSD). Twelve Sprague-Dawley
   rats were randomized to four groups: control (defect only),
   decellularized bone matrix (DECBM), and HGCS with and without
   multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPCs). DECBM was prepared by
   removing all the cells using SDS and NH4 OH. After 12 weeks, the CSD
   specimens were harvested to evaluate radiographical, histological, and
   histomorphometrical outcomes. The in vitro osteogenic effects of the
   materials were studied by focal adhesion, MTS, and alizarin red.
   Micro-CT analysis indicated that the DECBM and the HGCS scaffold groups
   developed greater radiopaque areas than the other groups. Bone
   regeneration, assessed using histological analysis and fluorochrome
   labeling, was the highest in the HGCS scaffold seeded with MAPCs. The
   DECBM group showed limited osteoinductivity, causing a gap between the
   implant and host tissue. The group grafted with HGCS+ MAPCs resulting in
   twice as much new bone formation seems to indicate a role for effective
   bone regeneration. In conclusion, the novel HGCS scaffold could improve
   bone regeneration and is a promising carrier for stem cell-mediated bone
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen plays a major role in cancer biology and tumor progression. In
   PDT, the reduction in efficacy is directly related to lack of oxygen
   because its molecular mechanism relies on oxygen as an energy mediator.
   Measuring tumor oxygenation can provide physicians with better diagnosis
   and optimization of treatment plans. However, clinical tools for
   directly assessing tissue oxygenation are limited. The gold standard is
   oxygen needle electrode, which is invasive and measures oxygen level at
   a single location.
   We present our work on developing a combined treatment-imaging modality
   that integrates PDT and photoacoustic oxygen imaging. We propose a
   system designed for clinical treatments of cancer of the oral cavity.
   Tissue oxygen imaging is performed by applying Photoacoustic Lifetime
   Imaging (PALI). This technology relies on photoacoustic probing of
   oxygen-dependent excitation lifetime of Methylene Blue. The dye is
   excited by the same wavelength of illumination source for PDT. Once
   excited, the population of photosensitizer molecules at triplet state
   has a lifetime depending on the oxygen level. The transition from
   excited triplet state to ground state can be probe by another laser,
   which generate photoacoustic signal that is used to map the lifetime.
   The lifetime map is then converted to pO(2) distribution.
   We expect that PDT efficacy can be improved by applying PALI imaging
   feedback in real-time to determine, and individually optimize,
   O-2-enriched gas breathing parameters and PDT light-dose during
   treatment. Successful implementation of PALI in PDT can also drive its
   application in guiding other cancer treatments that are affected by
   hypoxia.}},

Abstract = {{Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) nanocrystals were synthesized via thermolysis of
   single-source cation and sulfur precursors copper, zinc and tin
   diethyldithiocarbamates. The average nanocrystal size could be tuned
   between 2 nm and 40 nm, by varying the synthesis temperature between 150
   degrees C and 340 degrees C. The synthesis is rapid and is completed in
   less than 10 minutes. Characterization by X-ray diffraction, Raman
   spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive
   X-ray spectroscopy confirm that the nanocrystals are nominally
   stoichiometric kesterite CZTS. The similar to 2 nm nanocrystals
   synthesized at 150 degrees C exhibit quantum confinement, with a band
   gap of 1.67 eV. Larger nanocrystals have the expected bulk CZTS band gap
   of 1.5 eV. Several micron thick films deposited by drop casting
   colloidal dispersions of similar to 40 nm CZTS nanocrystals were
   crack-free, while those cast using 5 nm nanocrystals had micron-scale
   cracks.}},

Abstract = {{While didactic training is a crucial element of education in the health
   care profession, current technologies leveraging low cost data
   acquisition and processing may provide an attractive alternative means
   for rapid, objective assessment of the foundational skills. When these
   technologies are leveraged towards improving the procedural surgical
   skill set, there is a strong opportunity for enhancing current training
   practices. While the proctor will still play a crucial role in the
   refinement of clinical judgment, affordable options for rapid training
   of procedural skills may serve as an avenue to free an expert proctor to
   focus on the more nuanced elements of medical training. Here we propose
   and implement a system for the low cost assessment and training of
   procedural surgical skills. A knot-tying module and a tool articulation
   module were created using affordable sensing technologies, and initial
   validation with a trained clinician showed that the devices could
   discriminate correctly and poorly tied knots. The system lays the
   framework for a modular experiential component of skills development in
   the training of health professionals.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{27}},
Pages = {{14271-14280}},
Abstract = {{Zirconium-doped ceria (Ce1-xZrxO2) was synthesized through a controlled
   electrospinning process as a promising approach to cost-effective,
   sinter-resistant material structures for high-temperature, solar-driven
   thermochemical redox cycles. To approximate a two-step redox cycle for
   solar fuel production, fibrous Ce1-xZrxO2 with relatively low levels of
   Zr-doping (0 < x < 0.1) were cycled in an infrared-imaging furnace with
   high-temperature (up to 1500 degrees C) partial reduction and
   lower-temperature (similar to 800 degrees C) reoxidation via CO2
   splitting to produce CO. Increases in Zr content improve reducibility
   and sintering resistance, and, for x <= 0.05, do not significantly slow
   reoxidation kinetics for CO production. Cycle stability of the fibrous
   Ce1-xZrxO2 (with x = 0.025) was assessed for a range of conditions by
   measuring rates of O-2 release during reduction and CO production during
   reoxidation and by assessing post-cycling fiber crystallite sizes and
   surface areas. Sintering increases with reduction temperature but occurs
   primarily along the fiber axes. Even after 108 redox cycles with
   reduction at 1400 degrees C and oxidation with CO2 at 800 degrees C, the
   fibers maintain their structure with surface areas of similar to 0.3
   m(2) g(-1), higher than those observed in the literature for other
   ceria-based structures operating at similarly high temperature
   conditions. Total CO production and peak production rate stabilize above
   3.0 mL g(-1) and 13.0 mL min(-1) g(-1), respectively. The results show
   the potential for electrospun oxides as sinter-resistant material
   structures with adequate surface area to support rapid CO2 splitting in
   solar thermochemical redox cycles.}},

Title = {{Forest Certification in Bolivia: A Status Report and Analysis of
   Stakeholder Perspectives}},
Journal = {{FOREST PRODUCTS JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{80-89}},
Abstract = {{Forest certification systems are voluntary, market-based initiatives to
   promote the sustainable use of forests. The assumption is that consumers
   prefer sustainably sourced wood products. One of the major drivers for
   the creation of forest certification was to prevent deforestation in
   tropical forests. However, after 20 years of certification, only 10
   percent of the global forest area is certified, mostly in temperate
   regions. Only 2 percent of tropical forests have been certified, and
   deforestation proceeds at alarming rates in those same areas. Africa and
   Latin America are the only regions with a net loss of forest area in the
   2000 to 2010 decade. In this article, the status of forest certification
   is analyzed, and challenges and opportunities are evaluated using the
   case of Bolivia. After an initial period of successful implementation of
   certification, the area of Bolivian forest under certification has
   fallen sharply, and deforestation has actually increased in the 2000 to
   2010 period, compared with the previous decade. This research uses
   qualitative research methods to uncover the reasons for the rapid
   initial growth of certification in Bolivia, its subsequent decline, and
   prospects for the future of certification in this South American country
   from the perspectives of people living and working in Bolivia's forestry
   sector. Participants concurred that a strong regulatory framework and
   international support were key factors to the initial success of
   certification in Bolivia. Benefits from certification commonly cited
   were improvement in the standard of living of timber-reliant
   communities, better markets for certified products, and an improvement
   in the image of the forest products industry.}},

Abstract = {{A pathway for achieving intense green light emitting LiGdF4:Yb,Er
   upconversion nanophosphors (UCNPs) via Y3+ doping is demonstrated. It
   was revealed that Y3+ doping initiated the formation of a tetragonal
   phase and affected the particle size. Single tetragonal-phase
   LiGd0.4Y0.4F4:Yb(18\%),Er(2\%) (LGY(0.4)F:Yb,Er) UCNPs exhibited strong
   upconversion (UC) green luminescence and tetragonal bipyramidal
   morphologies. They showed 1325 and 325-fold higher photoluminescence
   intensity than the 0 and 80 mol\% Y3+-doped LiGdF4:Yb,Er UCNPs,
   respectively. Additionally the particle size (edge length) of
   LiGdF4:Yb,Er-based upconversion tetragonal bipyramids (UCTBs) was
   controlled from 60.5 nm to an ultrasmall size of 9.3 nm with varying Y3+
   doping concentration. In an LGY(0.4)F:Yb,Er UCTB, uniform distribution
   of all constituent elements was directly confirmed by using high-angle
   annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy and
   energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM) image analyses.
   In particular, existence of activator Er3+ ions with extremely small
   quantity was clearly seen over a particle on the EFTEM image. Moreover,
   the LGY(0.4)F:Yb,Er UCTBs were successfully incorporated into the
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer and the highly transparent UCTB-PDMS
   composites showed bright green light under the excitation of 980 nm
   infrared light.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past 5 years there has been a major transformation in our
   ability to precisely manipulate the genomes of animals. Efficiencies of
   introducing precise genetic alterations in large animal genomes have
   improved 100 000-fold due to a succession of site-specific nucleases
   that introduce double-strand DNA breaks with a specificity of 10 (9).
   Herein we describe our applications of site-specific nucleases,
   especially transcription activator-like effector nucleases, to engineer
   specific alterations in the genomes of pigs and cows. We can introduce
   variable changes mediated by non-homologous end joining of DNA breaks to
   inactive genes. Alternatively, using homology-directed repair, we have
   introduced specific changes that support either precise alterations in a
   gene's encoded polypeptide, elimination of the gene or replacement by
   another unrelated DNA sequence. Depending on the gene and the mutation,
   we can achieve 10\%-50\% effective rates of precise mutations.
   Applications of the new precision genetics are extensive. Livestock now
   can be engineered with selected phenotypes that will augment their value
   and adaption to variable ecosystems. In addition, animals can be
   engineered to specifically mimic human diseases and disorders, which
   will accelerate the production of reliable drugs and devices. Moreover,
   animals can be engineered to become better providers of biomaterials
   used in the medical treatment of diseases and disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Flow expansions are a fundamental mechanism of sediment deposition. Here
   we define flow expansions as self-formed alluvial expanding deposits
   developing over a larger experimental delta that 1) are characterized by
   unchannelized flow, comprising a single sheet flow that covers the
   entire surface of the expansion, and (2) do not interact laterally with
   still fluid and thus are not related to jets. The flow-spreading
   mechanism is transverse topographic curvature rather than mixing with
   ambient fluid; hence we term these expansions ``topographic
   expansions{''} to distinguish them from jet-related flow expansions. In
   topographic expansions, transverse bed convexity drives lateral flow,
   allowing topographic expansions to maintain much higher, and more
   variable, opening angles than those of jet-related expansions. The
   characteristic depositional body produced by the expansions is a
   relatively thin, tabular sand body with a flat base and slightly convex
   top, comparable to some ``sheet flood{''} deposits in the stratigraphic
   record. Most of the deposition takes place as the topographic expansion
   develops, Mowed by a longer interval of stable sediment bypass, where
   all measured flow expansions show similar geometries. This stable-bypass
   phase is typically terminated by the flow abandoning the deposit or by
   channelization of the deposit itself, after which the cycle can begin
   again. One of the research questions raised by this study is the
   mechanism by which topographic expansions are able to maintain
   themselves in an unchannelized condition at flow aspect ratios that
   should be unstable according to current theories of bar and channel
   instability.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{633-648}},
Abstract = {{By integrating groundwater, surface water and vadose zone systems, the
   terrestrial hydrologic system can be used to spatially map water balance
   characteristics spanning local to global scales, even when long-term
   stream gauge data are unavailable. The Watershed Characteristics
   Approach (WCA) is a hydrologic estimation model developed using a
   system-based approach focused on the regionalization of landscape
   characteristics to define unique hierarchical hydrogeological units
   (HHUs) and establish their link to hydrologic characteristics. Although
   the WCA can be used to map any hydrologic variable, its validity is
   demonstrated by summarizing results generated by applying the
   methodology to quantify the renewable groundwater flux at a spatial
   scale lacking long-term stream gauge monitoring data. Landscape
   components for 97 East-Central Minnesota (ECM) watersheds were
   summarized and used to identify which unique combinations of
   characteristics statistically influenced mean annual minimum groundwater
   recharge. These resulting combinations of landscape characteristics
   defined each HHU; as additional characteristics were applied, units were
   refined to create a hierarchical organization. Results were mapped to
   spatially represent the renewable groundwater flux for ECM,
   demonstrating how hydrologic regionalization can address knowledge gaps
   in multi-scale processes and aid in quantifying water balance
   components, an essential key to sustainable water resources management.}},

Abstract = {{A common problem in statistics is to compute sample vectors from a
   multivariate Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a given covariance
   matrix A. A canonical approach to the problem is to compute vectors of
   the form y = Sz, where S is the Cholesky factor or square root of A, and
   z is a standard normal vector. When A is large, such an approach becomes
   computationally expensive. This paper considers preconditioned Krylov
   subspace methods to perform this task. The Lanczos process provides a
   means to approximate A(1/2)z for any vector z from an m-dimensional
   Krylov subspace. The main contribution of this paper is to show how to
   enhance the convergence of the process via preconditioning. Both
   incomplete Cholesky preconditioners and approximate inverse
   preconditioners are discussed. It is argued that the latter class of
   preconditioners has an advantage in the context of sampling. Numerical
   tests, performed with stationary covariance matrices used to model
   Gaussian processes, illustrate the dramatic improvement in computation
   time that can result from preconditioning.}},

   homopolymers, we report the strengths and limitations of the ROMP of

Journal = {{MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The problem of stabilization of rigid bodies has received a great deal
   of attention for many years. People have developed a variety of feedback
   control laws to meet their design requirements and have formulated
   various but mostly open loop numerical algorithms for the dynamics of
   the corresponding closed loop systems. Since the conserved quantities
   such as energy, momentum, and symmetry play an important role in the
   dynamics, we investigate the conserved quantities for the closed loop
   control systems which formally or asymptotically stabilize rigid body
   rotation and modify the open loop numerical algorithms so that they
   preserve these important properties. Using several examples, the authors
   first use the open loop algorithm to simulate the tumbling rigid body
   actions and then use the resulting closed loop one to stabilize them.}},

Abstract = {{In-situ powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) is a powerful technique to study
   crystalline phase changes during electrochemical cycling of battery
   materials. However, current cell designs are bulky, expensive, and often
   contain beryllium. Even less expensive coin cells with Kapton windows
   cost more than US\$20, combined with the additional cost of a special
   attachment within the instrument to allow for simultaneous
   electrochemical and XRD testing. Herein, we report the design of a
   low-cost electrochemical cell for in-situ XRD analysis using polymer
   components. The single-use cell costs less than US\$1.50 and can be used
   in an unmodified powder X-ray diffractometer. It is tested using
   commercial LiFePO4 (LFP) as a well-known model system to demonstrate the
   ability of the cell to accurately monitor phase transitions within a
   cathode material during electrochemical cycling. (C) 2014 The

Title = {{Quantitative Analysis of Microtubule Self-assembly Kinetics and Tip
   Structure}},

Abstract = {{Microtubules are dynamic polymers of the cytoskeleton, which play
   important roles in cell division, polarization, and intracellular
   transport. Self-assembly of microtubule polymer from alpha beta-tubulin
   heterodimers is highly variable, with stochastic switching between
   alternate states of net growth and net shortening, a phenomenon known as
   dynamic instability. Microtubule tip structures are also variable and
   directly influence the kinetics of assembly and vice versa. TipTracker,
   a semiautomated, image processing-based tool, permits high spatial and
   temporal resolution measurements from fluorescence microscopy images
   (similar to 10-40 nm, or 1-5 dimer lengths, at 1-10 Hz) with
   simultaneous tip structure estimation. We provide a walkthrough of the
   TipTracker code to demonstrate methods used to (1) fit the coordinates
   of the microtubule backbone; (2) track microtubule tip position; and (3)
   estimate tip structure from the spatial decay of the tip fluorescence
   distribution, discuss possible sources of error, and include an example
   protocol for nanometer-scale tip tracking in living cells. Additionally,
   we evaluate TipTracker's accuracy on simulated digital images and fixed
   microtubules to estimate accuracy under realistic imaging conditions. In
   summary, this chapter demonstrates the use of TipTracker in making
   robust, high-resolution measurements of microtubule tip dynamics and
   structures, facilitating quantitative investigations into
   nanoscale/molecular control of microtubule assembly. Although our
   primary focus is on microtubules, these methods are, in principle,
   suitable for other polymer structures, such as F-actin.}},

Title = {{Modeling and Application of Pedestrian Safety Conflict Index at

Journal = {{DISCRETE DYNAMICS IN NATURE AND SOCIETY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Traffic conflict between turning vehicles and pedestrians is the leading
   cause of pedestrian fatalities at signalized intersections. In order to
   provide a solution for evaluating intersection safety for vulnerable
   road users, this paper first determines the most important factors in
   analyzing pedestrian-vehicle conflict and puts forward a pedestrian
   safety conflict index (SCI) model to establish a quantitative standard
   for safety evaluation of two-or multiphase intersections. A safety level
   system is then designed based on SCI to help categorize and describe the
   safety condition of intersections applicable to the model. Finally, the
   SCI model is applied to the evaluation of two intersections in the city
   of Changchun, the result of which complies with expectation, indicating
   the model's potential in providing an improved approach for
   pedestrian-vehicle conflict evaluation study.}},

Abstract = {{Photo-generated transient species, such as the carbonate radical and
   triplet excited state natural organic matter, mediate the oxidation of
   pollutants in various sunlit or artificially irradiated systems. In this
   work, one-electron oxidation potentials for 70 nitrogen-containing
   compounds were computed, and literature data were used to develop
   quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) for prediction of
   the second order reaction rate constants with these two oxidants. For
   carbonate radical, separate QSARs were necessary for compounds with and
   without resonance stabilization of the resulting radical, and predicted
   rate constants were, on average, within a factor of three of
   experimental values. With the limited data set available, results
   suggest that one-electron oxidation potential is also a viable

Abstract = {{Reflectance monitoring of an optical fiber micromirror system was

   optical fiber system was also used to measure corrosion rates of Cu in
   saturated ammonium sulfate solutions in which different concentrations
   of oxygen were dissolved by purging the solutions with gases containing
   varying partial pressures of oxygen, P-O, (total pressure 1 atm).
   Corrosion rates for the Cu in ammonium sulfate were found to show first
   order dependence on the dissolved oxygen concentration in the regime
   (0.0 <= P-O <= 1.0 atm) and compared favorably with literature data for

Abstract = {{Bio-based poly(delta-decalactone) is an amorphous, low glass transition
   temperature (T-g) material and it is an aliphatic polyester (Martello et

   thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU). We describe the synthesis and
   purification of low molar mass poly(delta-decalactone) diols (PdDL), as
   well as the synthesis and characterization of new PdDL-based TPUs. The
   PdDLs obtained were characterized by proton nuclear magnetic resonance
   (H-1-NMR) spectroscopy and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
   mass spectroscopy. Three different PdDLs were prepared and their molar
   masses calculated from H-1-NMR spectroscopy were: M-n approximate to
   1300, 1800 and 2700 g mol(-1). These three PdDLs were reacted with
   4,40-methylenebis(phenyl isocyanate) and two different chain extenders
   (1,4-butanediol and water), to synthesize polyester-based TPUs. The TPUs
   made from PdDLs with M-n of 1800 and 2700 exhibit good elastomeric
   properties and their T-g values are around -40 degrees C. With water as
   chain extender urea bonds were created, which gave TPUs with higher

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{36}},

Abstract = {{Prior to the parallel solution of a large linear system, it is required
   to perform a partitioning of its equations/unknowns. Standard
   partitioning algorithms are designed using the considerations of the
   efficiency of the parallel matrix-vector multiplication, and typically
   disregard the information on the coefficients of the matrix. This
   information, however, may have a significant impact on the quality of
   the preconditioning procedure used within the chosen iterative scheme.
   In the present paper, we suggest a spectral partitioning algorithm,
   which takes into account the information on the matrix coefficients and
   constructs partitions with respect to the objective of enhancing the
   quality of the nonoverlapping additive Schwarz (block Jacobi)
   preconditioning for symmetric positive definite linear systems. For a
   set of test problems with large variations in magnitudes of matrix
   coefficients, our numerical experiments demonstrate a noticeable
   improvement in the convergence of the resulting solution scheme when
   using the new partitioning approach.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the structural features of lignin (L) and
   lignin-carbohydrate complexes (LCC) in bamboo (Phyllostachys pubescens
   Mazel) is important in order to expand the use of bamboo biomass. In
   this study, L and LCC were isolated from four-year-old mature bamboo
   using an organic solvent as an extractant. The structural features of L
   and LCC were characterized via UV-vis, FT-IR, NMR, sugar composition
   analysis, and alkaline nitrobenzene oxidation. L and LCC contained
   almost the same structural units: guaiacyl (G), syringyl (S),
   p-hydroxybenzoate substructures (PB), beta-O-4' substructures (A),
   3-O-acetyl-(1 -> 4)-linked-beta- D-xylopyranosyl (beta Xyl3), (1 ->
   4)-linked-alpha(beta)-D-xylopyranosyl (alpha(beta)Xyl), and
   4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronic acid (MeGlcA(1 -> 4)). The contents of the
   units varied between L and LCC. Carbohydrates linked with lignin in L
   and LCC mainly consisted of xylans. The sugar units of carbohydrates
   linked with lignin in LCC were determined to be of xylose (76.98\%),
   arabinose (4.08\%), glucose (6.47\%), mannose (6.34\%), altrose
   (3.69\%), galactose (1.75\%), and ribose (0.69\%). The S (75.80\%) and G
   (24.20\%) units with a high S/G ratio of 3.13 were the main structural
   elements of lignin associated with carbohydrates in LCC.}},

Abstract = {{Improved methods are needed to study sorption of vapor molecules by
   particles in the gas phase (heterogeneous uptake), which is an important
   process in both natural and engineered environments. Here, a new
   measurement system, composed of a differential mobility analyzer (DMA)
   and drift tube ion mobility spectrometer (DTIMS) in series, is used to
   examine the heterogeneous uptake of water vapor by 2.85-7.6 nm particles
   composed of lithium and sodium iodide. The extent of heterogeneous
   uptake is determined by controlling the relative humidity of the drift
   region in the DTIMS in the 0-30\% range (in air at atmospheric pressure
   and room temperature), and is quantified via the dimensionless growth
   factor (GF), i.e. the ratio of the mobility diameter of particles at a
   prescribed relative humidity relative to their mobility diameter under
   dry conditions. The precision in GF estimation of the DMA-DTIMS system
   is shown to be below 0.2\%. An analytical equation to calculate the
   growth factor, based upon predictions of the equilibrium constants for
   the successive uptake of vapor molecules by particles, is also
   presented. While the equation is sufficiently general to enable
   comparison between measured GFs and predictions from any theoretical
   expression for equilibrium constants, we specifically compare
   measurements to GF predictions based on the classical
   Kelvin-Thomson-Raoult (KTR) model for the vapor pressure of a small
   particle, with consideration of the influence of the ion-dipole
   potential on water vapor-nanoparticle collisions. It is shown that KTR
   calculations drastically underpredict the extent of heterogeneous uptake
   for the examined nanoparticles.}},

Abstract = {{Sequence-specific nucleases enable facile editing of higher eukaryotic
   genomic DNA; however, targeted modification of plant genomes remains
   challenging due to ineffective methods for delivering reagents for
   genome engineering to plant cells. Here, we use geminivirus-based
   replicons for transient expression of sequence-specific nucleases
   (zinc-finger nucleases, transcription activator-like effector nucleases,
   and the clustered, regularly interspaced, short palindromic repeat/Cas
   system) and delivery of DNA repair templates. In tobacco (Nicotiana
   tabacum), replicons based on the bean yellow dwarf virus enhanced gene
   targeting frequencies one to two orders of magnitude over conventional
   Agrobacterium tumefaciens T-DNA. In addition to the nuclease-mediated
   DNA double-strand breaks, gene targeting was promoted by replication of
   the repair template and pleiotropic activity of the geminivirus
   replication initiator proteins. We demonstrate the feasibility of using
   geminivirus replicons to generate plants with a desired DNA sequence
   modification. By adopting a general plant transformation method,
   plantlets with a desired DNA change were regenerated in <6 weeks. These
   results, in addition to the large host range of geminiviruses, advocate
   the use of replicons for plant genome engineering.}},

Volume = {{42}},

Abstract = {{Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a promising technology to treat
   local malignant cancer using short, high-voltage electric pulses.
   Unfortunately, in vivo studies show that IRE suffers from an inability
   to destroy large volumes of cancer tissue without introduction of
   cytotoxic agents and/or increasing the applied electrical dose to
   dangerous levels. This research will address this limitation by
   lever-aging membrane-targeting mechanisms that increase lethal membrane
   permeabilization. Methods that directly modify membrane properties or
   change the pulse delivery timing are proposed that do not rely on
   cytotoxic agents. This work shows that significant enhancement (67-75\%
   more cell destruction in vitro and >100\% treatment volume increase in
   vivo) can be achieved using membrane-targeting approaches for IRE cancer
   destruction. The methods introduced are surfactants (i.e., DMSO) and
   pulse timing which are low cost, non-toxic, and easy to be incorporated
   into existing clinical use. Moreover, when needed, these methods can
   also be combined with electrochemotherapy to further enhance IRE
   treatment efficacy.}},

Journal = {{BIOMATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{548-559}},
Abstract = {{Islet transplantation is a promising treatment for type 1 diabetes, but
   despite the successes, existing challenges prevent widespread
   application. Ischemia, occurring during pancreas preservation and
   isolation, as well as after islet transplantation, decreases islet
   viability and function. We hypothesized that the liposomal delivery of
   adenosine triphosphate (ATP) could prevent the loss of cell viability
   during an ischemic insult. In this work we use a model beta cell line,
   INS-1 to probe the liposome-cell interactions and examined the ability
   of liposomes functionalized with the fibronectin-mimetic peptide PR\_b
   to facilitate the delivery of ATP to ischemic beta cells. We demonstrate
   that PR\_b increases the binding and internalization of liposomes to the
   beta cells. Unexpectedly, when comparing the ability of PR\_b liposomes
   with and without ATP to protect INS-1 cells from ischemia we found that
   both formulations increased cell survival. By probing the functional
   activity of ischemic cells treated with PR\_b functionalized liposomes
   with and without ATP we find that both lipids and ATP play a role in
   maintaining cell metabolic activity after an ischemic insult and
   preventing cell necrosis. This approach may be beneficial for preventing
   ischemia related damage to islet cells, especially in the organ
   preservation stage.}},

Abstract = {{Lithium ion batteries are used extensively in electronic devices as well
   as hybrid and electric vehicles. The anode electrode layer in the
   battery can be fabricated by coating an aqueous dispersion of carbon,
   binder, and additives, and then drying. During manufacturing, the
   distribution of the binder through the coating thickness can become
   nonuniform, which compromises the properties and performance of the
   battery. In this study, a quantitative method to analyze the binder
   distribution in the electrode during drying was established. A drying
   apparatus with an integrated analytic balance and surface-temperature
   measurement was used to prepare specimens. At specific time points
   during drying, specimens were removed from the apparatus, quickly
   frozen, and then freeze-dried. Raman spectroscopy was then used to
   measure the binder concentration at different points through the cross
   section of the freeze-dried electrode coating. Scanning electron
   microscopy was also used to explore the changing microstructure
   qualitatively. Using a model electrode formulation, the method
   demonstrated different binder distributions for electrodes dried at 150A
   degrees C under airflow and room temperature, 20A degrees C, with no
   airflow. The results also showed continued changes in distribution in
   the interior of the coating as drying continued.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Pages = {{156-166}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Length-based vehicle classification is an important topic in traffic
   engineering, because estimation of traffic speed from single loop
   detectors usually requires the knowledge of vehicle length. In this
   paper, we present an algorithm that can classify vehicles passing by a
   loop detector into two categories: long vehicles and regular cars. The
   proposed algorithm takes advantage of event-based loop detector data
   that contains every vehicle detector actuation and de-actuation
   ``event{''}, therefore time gaps between consecutive vehicles and
   detector occupation time for each vehicle can be easily derived. The
   proposed algorithm is based on an intuitive observation that, for a
   vehicle platoon, longer vehicles in the platoon will have relatively
   longer detector occupation time. Therefore, we can identify longer
   vehicles by examining the changes of occupation time in a vehicle
   platoon. The method was tested using the event-based data collected from
   Trunk Highway 55 in Minnesota, which is a high speed arterial corridor
   controlled by semi-actuated coordinated traffic signals. The result
   shows that the proposed method can correctly classify most of the
   vehicles passing by a single loop detector. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{152-163}},
Abstract = {{Vascular smooth muscle cells in muscular arteries are more elongated
   than those in elastic arteries. Previously, we reported changes in the
   contractility of engineered vascular smooth muscle tissue that appeared
   to be correlated with the shape of the constituent cells, supporting the
   commonly held belief that elongated muscle geometry may allow for the
   better contractile tone modulation required in response to changes in
   blood flow and pressure. To test this hypothesis more rigorously, we
   developed an in vitro model by engineering human vascular smooth muscle
   cells to take on the same shapes as those seen in elastic and muscular
   arteries and measured their contraction during stimulation with
   endothelin-1. We found that in the engineered cells, actin alignment and
   nuclear eccentricity increased as the shape of the cell elongated.
   Smooth muscle cells with elongated shapes exhibited lower contractile
   strength but greater percentage increase in contraction after
   endothelin-1 stimulation. We analysed the relationship between smooth
   muscle contractility and subcellular architecture and found that changes
   in contractility were correlated with actin alignment and nuclear shape.
   These results suggest that elongated smooth muscle cells facilitate
   muscular artery tone modulation by increasing its dynamic contractile
   range.}},

Title = {{Indirect determination of size effect on strength of asphalt mixtures at

Volume = {{47}},

Abstract = {{Low temperature cracking of asphalt pavements is a major distress in
   cold regions. Accurate assessment of strength of asphalt mixtures at low
   temperatures is of great importance for ensuring the structural
   integrity of asphalt pavements. It has been shown that asphalt mixtures
   behave in a quasibrittle manner at low temperatures and consequently its
   nominal strength strongly depends on the structure size. The size effect
   on the strength of asphalt mixtures can be directly measured by testing
   geometrically similar specimens with a sufficiently large size range.
   Recent studies have shown in theory that for quasibrittle structures,
   which fail at the macrocrack initiation from one representative volume
   element, the mean size effect curve can also be derived from the scaling
   of strength statistics based on the finite weakest link model. This
   paper presents a comprehensive experimental investigation on the
   strength statistics as well as the size effect on the mean strength of
   asphalt mixtures at -24 A degrees C. It is shown that the size effect on
   mean structural strength can be obtained by strength histogram testing
   on specimens of a single size. The present study also indicates that the
   three-parameter Weibull distribution is not applicable for asphalt
   mixtures.}},

Abstract = {{The paper models and compares driving behavior and vehicular emissions
   at a roundabout. Four drivers drove a vehicle instrumented with a GPS
   data logger over a study route. Second-by-second vehicle positions were
   recorded for various runs. Speed profiles of drivers were modeled using
   a Bayesian inference methodology. Circulating speed and maximum
   accelerations were simulated from the speed profile models and were
   compared across drivers. In addition, vehicular emissions were estimated
   using past experimental data. It is found that speed profiles differ
   significantly across drivers, as do the mean speeds at the circulating
   path of the roundabout. Acceleration events correspond to significantly
   higher emissions since during acceleration more than required fuel is
   injected into the combustion chamber of the engine. An emissions hotspot
   was defined as group of consecutive locations on the route where the sum
   of absolute values of acceleration was more than 95 percentile.
   Emissions at these hotspots were more than 25\% of the emissions for a
   given speed profile. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For two watersheds in the northern Midwest United States, we show that
   landscape depressions have a significant impact on watershed hydrology
   and sediment yields and that the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)
   has appropriate features to simulate these depressions. In our SWAT
   models of the Willow River in Wisconsin and the Sunrise River in
   Minnesota, we used Pond and Wetland features to capture runoff from
   about 40\% of the area in each watershed. These depressions trapped
   considerable sediment, yet further reductions in sediment yield were
   required for calibration and achieved by reducing the Universal Soil
   Loss Equation (USLE) cropping-practice (P) factor to 0.40 to 0.45. We
   suggest terminology to describe annual sediment yields at different
   conceptual spatial scales and show how SWAT output can be partitioned to
   extract data at each of these scales. These scales range from plot-scale
   yields calculated with the USLE to watershed-scale yields measured at
   the outlet. Intermediate scales include field, upland, pre-riverine, and
   riverine scales, in descending order along the conceptual flow path from
   plot to outlet. Sediment delivery ratios, when defined as
   watershed-scale yields as a percentage of plot-scale yields, ranged from
   1\% for the Willow watershed (717 km(2)) to 7\% for the Sunrise
   watershed (991 km(2)). Sediment delivery ratios calculated from
   published relations based on watershed area alone were about 5 to 6\%,
   closer to pre-riverine-scale yields in our watersheds.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{205}},
Pages = {{164-169}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a highly sensitive strain sensor with vertically aligned
   zinc oxide (ZnO) nanowire arrays on polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
   film was reported. The device fabrication includes conventional
   photolithography, metallization, and ZnO nanowire growth through a
   hydrothermal method. I-V characteristics of the device were highly
   nonlinear due to the Schottky contact between the nanowire and the gold
   (Au) electrode. The conductivity of the device is significantly tuned by
   the change of ZnO/Au Schottky barrier that reflects the strain-induced
   piezoelectric potential. A gauge factor up to 1813 was obtained from
   this strain senor, which is higher than the previously reported device
   based on a lateral ZnO microwire. Theoretical analysis of the
   piezotronic effect shows that the working nanowire with the largest
   conductivity change dominates the performance of the device. The
   non-working nanowire has limited adverse effect on the performance,
   which explains the robust performance of this novel strain sensor. The
   stability and fast response of the sensor were also investigated. The
   sensitive and robust strain sensor is expected to find applications in
   civil, medical, and other fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This paper studies the role of sparse regularisation in a properly
   chosen basis for variational data assimilation (VDA) problems.
   Specifically, it focuses on data assimilation of noisy and down-sampled
   observations while the state variable of interest exhibits sparsity in
   the real or transform domains. We show that in the presence of sparsity,
   the l(1)-norm regularisation produces more accurate and stable solutions
   than the classic VDA methods. We recast the VDA problem under the
   l(1)-norm regularisation into a constrained quadratic programming
   problem and propose an efficient gradient-based approach, suitable for
   large-dimensional systems. The proof of concept is examined via
   assimilation experiments in the wavelet and spectral domain using the
   linear advection-diffusion equation.}},

Title = {{On the Fundamental Limits of Recovering Tree Sparse Vectors from Noisy
   Linear Measurements}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{133-149}},

Abstract = {{Recent breakthrough results in compressive sensing (CS) have established
   that many high dimensional signals can be accurately recovered from a
   relatively small number of non-adaptive linear observations, provided
   that the signals possess a sparse representation in some basis.
   Subsequent efforts have shown that the performance of CS can be improved
   by exploiting additional structure in the locations of the nonzero
   signal coefficients during inference or by utilizing some form of
   data-dependent adaptive measurement focusing during the sensing process.
   To the best of our knowledge, our own previous work was the first to
   establish the potential benefits that can be achieved when fusing the
   notions of adaptive sensing and structured sparsity. In that work, we
   examined the task of support recovery from noisy linear measurements,
   and established that an adaptive sensing strategy specifically tailored
   to signals that are tree-sparse can significantly outperform adaptive
   and non-adaptive sensing strategies that are agnostic to the underlying
   structure. In this paper, we establish fundamental performance limits
   for the task of support recovery of tree-sparse signals from noisy
   measurements, in settings where measurements may be obtained either
   non-adaptively (using a randomized Gaussian measurement strategy
   motivated by initial CS investigations) or by any adaptive sensing
   strategy. Our main results here imply that the adaptive tree sensing
   procedure analyzed in our previous work is nearly optimal, in the sense
   that no other sensing and estimation strategy can perform fundamentally
   better for identifying the support of tree-sparse signals.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{Consider a MIMO multi-cellular network (also known as an interfering
   broadcast channel) where each base station transmits signals to the
   users in its own cell. The basic problem is to design linear
   transmit/receive beamformers and schedule users across a fixed set of
   time slots so as to maximize the system throughput in the presence of
   both inter and intra cell interference. In this paper, we propose a
   joint linear transceiver design and user grouping scheme for sum utility
   maximization that is based on iterative minimization of weighted mean
   squared error (MSE). The proposed algorithm only needs local channel
   knowledge and its convergence to a stationary point is guaranteed for
   some well-known utility functions, while ensuring user fairness. The
   simulation results show that the proposed formulation/algorithm can
   offer significantly higher system throughput than the standard
   multi-user MIMO techniques such as the SVD-MMSE strategy, while
   maintaining user fairness. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm exhibits
   fast convergence and is amenable to distributed implementation with
   limited information exchange.}},

   for Symmetric Decomposition}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{62}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{211-224}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) has found numerous applications,
   due to its ability to provide interpretable decompositions. Perhaps
   surprisingly, existing results regarding its uniqueness properties are
   rather limited, and there is much room for improvement in terms of
   algorithms as well. Uniqueness aspects of NMF are revisited here from a
   geometrical point of view. Both symmetric and asymmetric NMF are
   considered, the former being tantamount to element-wise non-negative
   square-root factorization of positive semidefinite matrices. New
   uniqueness results are derived, e. g., it is shown that a sufficient
   condition for uniqueness is that the conic hull of the latent factors is
   a superset of a particular second-order cone. Checking this condition is
   shown to be NP-complete; yet this and other results offer insights on
   the role of latent sparsity in this context. On the computational side,
   a new algorithm for symmetric NMF is proposed, which is very different
   from existing ones. It alternates between Procrustes rotation and
   projection onto the non-negative orthant to find a non-negative matrix
   close to the span of the dominant subspace. Simulation results show
   promising performance with respect to the state-of-art. Finally, the new
   algorithm is applied to a clustering problem for co-authorship data,
   yielding meaningful and interpretable results.}},

Abstract = {{Efficiency of batch processing is becoming increasingly important for
   many modern commercial service centers, e.g., clusters and cloud
   computing datacenters. However, periodical resource contentions have
   become the major performance obstacles for concurrently running
   applications on mainstream CMP servers. I/O contention is such a kind of
   obstacle, which may impede both the co-running performance of batch jobs
   and the system throughput seriously. In this paper, a dynamic I/O-aware
   scheduling algorithm is proposed to lower the impacts of I/O contention
   and to enhance the co-running performance in batch processing. We set up
   our environment on an 8-socket, 64-core server in Dawning Linux Cluster.
   Fifteen workloads ranging from 8 jobs to 256 jobs are evaluated. Our
   experimental results show significant improvements on the throughputs of
   the workloads, which range from 7\% to 431\%. Meanwhile, noticeable
   improvements on the slowdown of workloads and the average runtime for
   each job can be achieved. These results show that a well-tuned dynamic
   I/O-aware scheduler is beneficial for batch-mode services. It can also
   enhance the resource utilization via throughput improvement on modern
   service platforms.}},

   conditions with a diol initiator. The solvent-free, room-temperature
   reaction conditions result in a viscous homopolymer from-which the
   catalyst is easily removed. Subsequent chain extension of this
   homopolymer with the renewable monomer L-lactide, followed by
   purification, isolation, and annealing in an aluminum pan, affords a
   block copolymer product as a transparent, flexible film. Well-resolved
   resonances in the H-1 NMR spectrum of the individual polymer repeat
   units facilitate quantitative analysis of polymer composition and
   molecular weight determination. This experiment introduces students to

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper addresses the following question: Under what conditions can
   reconstructed road crashes be used to estimate the effect of a
   safety-related countermeasure? Results developed by Pearl and his
   associates are used to draw two main conclusions. First, when one can
   (1) identify a structural equation describing a type of crash, (2)
   identify an additional structural equation describing the
   countermeasure's impact, and (3) estimate the initiating conditions for
   a set of reconstructed crashes, then a lower bound for a crash
   modification factor can be estimated by simulating whether or not each
   of the reconstructed crashes would still have occurred had the
   countermeasure been present. If the countermeasure's effect is monotonic
   this bound becomes tight. Second, in situations where it is not possible
   to reliably identify the structural equations needed for simulation, but
   where one can (1) identify a set of crash inputs which, when given, make
   the crash outcome conditionally independent of the countermeasure, and
   (2) predict how the distribution of these inputs will change in response
   to the countermeasure, then nonparametric estimation of the
   countermeasure's crash modification factor is possible. When it is not
   possible to predict the countermeasure's effect on the conditioning
   variables it may still be possible to identify constraints or
   specifications which the countermeasure should satisfy in order to
   realize a target crash modification. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-complexity algorithm and architecture to
   compute power spectral density (PSD) using the Welch method. The Welch
   algorithm provides a good estimate of the spectral power at the cost of
   high computational complexity. We propose a new modified approach to
   reduce the computational complexity of the Welch PSD computation for a
   50\% overlap. In the proposed approach, an N/2-point FFT is computed,
   where is the length of the window and is merged with the FFT of the
   previous N/2-point to generate an N-point FFT of the overlapped segment.
   This requires replacing the windowing operation as a convolution in the
   frequency domain. Fortunately, the frequency-domain filtering requires a
   symmetric 3-tap or 5-tap FIR filter for raised cosine windows. The
   proposed method needs to compute (L + 1) N/2-point FFTs instead of L
   N-point FFTs, where L is the number of overlapping segments. In the
   proposed novel merged FFT approach, the even samples are computed
   exactly, while the odd samples require a shift by a half-sample delay
   and are estimated using a bidirectional fractional-delay filter. The
   complexity reduction comes at the cost of slight performance loss due to
   the approximation used for the implementation of the fractional-delay
   filter. The performance loss is about 8\% using fractional-delay filter
   with 2 multipliers. A novel architecture is presented based on the
   proposed algorithm. The proposed architecture not only consumes 33\%
   less energy compared to the original method but also reduces the latency
   by about 44\% for 8 overlapping segments. Further a low-complexity
   architecture is presented to compute a special case of the short-time
   Fourier transform based on the proposed PSD computation algorithm.}},

Title = {{Untangling drivers of species distributions: Global sensitivity and

Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{51}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Untangling drivers of systems and uncertainty for species distribution
   models (SDMs) is important to provide reliable predictions that are
   useful for conservation campaigns. This is particularly true for species
   whose habitat is threatened by climate change that enhances the
   uncertainty in future species distributions. Global sensitivity and
   uncertainty analyses (GSUA) is a robust method to globally investigate
   the uncertainty of SDMs and the importance of species distributions'
   drivers in space and time.
   Here we apply GSUA to MAXENT that is one of the popular presence-only
   SDMs. We consider the Snowy Plover (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus)
   (SP) in Florida that is a shorebird whose habitat is affected by sea
   level rise due to climate change. The importance of intrinsic and
   exogenous input factors to the uncertainty of the species distribution
   is evaluated for MAXENT. GSUA is applied for three projections of the
   habitat (2006, 2060, and 2100) according to the A1B sea level rise
   scenario. The large land cover variation determines a moderate decrease
   in habitat suitability in 2060 and 2100 prospecting a low risk of
   decline for the SP. The regularization parameter for the environmental
   features, the uncertainty into the classification of salt-marsh,
   transitional marsh, and ocean beach, and the maximum number of
   iterations for the model training are in this order the most important
   input factors for the average habitat suitability. These results are
   related to the SP but, in general MAXENT appears as a very non-linear
   model where uncertainty mostly derives from the interactions among input
   factors.
   The uncertainty of the output is a species-specific variable. Thus, GSUA
   need be performed for each case considering local exogenous input
   factors of the model. GSUA allows quantitative informed
   species-management decisions by providing scenarios with controlled
   uncertainty and confidence over factors' importance that can be used by
   resource managers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Air-cooled heat sinks are widely used for microelectronics cooling.
   Piezoelectrically-driven agitators and synthetic jets (syn-jets) have
   been reported as good options in enhancing heat transfer on nearby
   surfaces. This study proposes that agitators and syn-jets be integrated
   within air-cooled heat sinks to significantly augment heat transfer
   performance. The proposed integration is investigated experimentally and
   computationally in a single-channel heat sink with one agitator and two
   syn-jet arrays. The study of a single channel between two fins is a
   precursor to the design of a full scale, multi-channel heat sink. The
   agitator and syn-jet arrays are separately driven by three piezoelectric
   stacks operating at their individual resonant frequencies to actively
   disrupt and mix the bulk air flow within the channel. The experiments
   show that the combination of the agitator and syn-jets raises the heat
   transfer coefficient of the channel by 82.4\%, compared with a same
   channel having channel flow only. The computations show similar rises
   that agree well with the experiments. The numerical simulations
   attribute the active heat transfer enhancement to the turbulence
   introduced in the channel flow near the tips of the fins which
   constitute the channel walls by the syn-jets and the vortices introduced
   in the channel flow near the side and base of the channel walls by the
   agitator plate. Heat transfer enhancement by the agitator and syn-jets
   increases as their amplitude or frequency increases, but the increase
   percentage by these active components decreases as the channel flow
   velocity increases. A correlation between the average Nusselt number for
   the channel walls and the Reynolds numbers for the channel flow,
   agitator, and syn-jet is established. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{27}},

Abstract = {{Stratospheric ozone is expected to recover by the end of this century
   because of the regulation of ozone-depleting substances by the Montreal
   Protocol. Targeted modeling studies have suggested that the climate
   response to ozone recovery will greatly oppose the climate response to
   rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the extent of this
   cancellation remains unclear since only a few such studies are
   available. Here, a much larger set of simulations performed for phase 5
   of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project is analyzed, which includes
   ozone recovery. It is shown that the closing of the ozone hole will
   cause a delay in summertime {[}December-February (DJF)] Southern
   Hemisphere climate change between now and 2045. Specifically, it is
   found that the position of the jet stream, the width of the subtropical
   dry zones, the seasonality of surface temperatures, and sea ice
   concentrations all exhibit significantly reduced summertime trends over
   the first half of the twenty-first century as a consequence of ozone
   recovery. After 2045, forcing from GHG emissions begins to dominate the
   climate response. Finally, comparing the relative influences of future
   GHG emissions and historic ozone depletion, it is found that the
   simulated DJF tropospheric circulation changes between 1965 and 2005
   (driven primarily by ozone depletion) are larger than the projected
   changes in any future scenario over the entire twenty-first century.}},

Abstract = {{Nanocrystals are known to alter the relative stability of bulk solid
   phases. Here we test the limits of this effect on Ag2Se nanocrystals, a
   promising new electronic and infrared material. In the bulk, Ag2Se
   exhibits a solid-solid phase transition to a superionic conducting phase
   at moderate temperatures. We map this phase transition as a function of
   size, temperature, and surface treatment in Ag2Se core-only and
   core-shell nanocrystals. We show that the transition can be tuned not
   just below but also above the bulk phase-transition temperature. This
   phase flexibility has implications for applications in optoelectronic
   and phase-memory devices.}},

Abstract = {{The primary challenge in solid-state polymer electrolyte membranes
   (PEMs) is to enhance properties, such as modulus, toughness, and high
   temperature stability, without sacrificing ionic conductivity. We report
   a remarkably facile one-pot synthetic strategy based on
   polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) to generate
   nanostructured PEMs that exhibit an unprecedented combination of high
   modulus and ionic conductivity. Simple heating of a poly(ethylene oxide)
   macromolecular chain transfer agent dissolved in a mixture of ionic
   liquid, styrene and divinylbenzene, leads to a bicontinuous PEM
   comprising interpenetrating nanodomains of highly cross-linked
   polystyrene and poly(ethylene oxide)/ionic liquid. Ionic conductivities
   higher than the 1 mS/cm benchmark were achieved in samples with an
   elastic modulus approaching 1 GPa at room temperature. Crucially, these
   samples are robust solids above 100 degrees C, where the conductivity is
   significantly higher. This strategy holds tremendous potential to
   advance lithium-ion battery technology by enabling the use of lithium
   metal anodes or to serve as membranes in high-temperature fuel cells.}},

Title = {{Assessment of the Hydraulic and Toxic Metal Removal Capacities of
   Bioretention Cells After 2 to 8 Years of Service}},
Journal = {{WATER AIR AND SOIL POLLUTION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{225}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Bioretention cells, also known as raingardens, are increasingly being
   constructed as a means to collect, infiltrate, and treat stormwater
   runoff. There are concerns, however, about how stormwater management
   practices might function in terms of infiltration and pollutant removal
   as they age. Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat) values were
   obtained for eight cells in 2006 and again for three of those cells in
   2010 using an infiltrometer. A strong positive correlation of mean K-sat
   with service time was observed (slope = 10.2 +/- 2.4 cm/h per year, R-2
   = 0.67). Results from metals analyses of bioretention media cores
   collected from six bioretention cells showed the expected trend of Cu
   and Zn enrichment at the surface while Cd was detected only in one out
   of 72 media samples analyzed. Sorption isotherms from batch testing of
   field media samples (T = 22.5 degrees C, pH = 7.2) were used to estimate
   metal sorption capacities based on representative stormwater Cd and Zn
   concentrations. Cu was not considered, as very little of the metal is
   dissolved under these conditions (22.8 +/- 7.1 \%). The mean equilibrium
   sorption capacities for Cd (10.2 +/- 3.1 mg/kg) and Zn (294.9 +/- 14.9
   mg/kg) far exceeded observed levels in the bioretentionmedia such that
   the remaining sorption capacity was >= 83 \% for Zn and >= 90\% for Cd
   for the cells. Overall, the results of this investigation suggest that
   bioretention cells can provide many years of effective infiltration (>6
   years) and metals removal performance (>25 years).}},

   acquisition. Then, based on mixture volumetric properties, a three-phase
   material model is obtained. Finally, 2- and 3-point correlation
   functions of the material phases are numerically evaluated. No
   significant differences were observed in the microstructure and spatial
   distributions of aggregates, asphalt mastic, and air voids for asphalt

Abstract = {{A control scheme is proposed for an islanded lowinertia three-phase
   inverter-based microgrid with a high penetration of photovoltaic (PV)
   generation resources. The output of each inverter is programmed to
   emulate the dynamics of a nonlinear oscillator. The virtual oscillators
   within each controller are implicitly coupled through the physical
   electrical network. The asymptotic synchronization of the oscillators
   can be guaranteed by design, and as a result, a stable power system
   emerges innately with no communication between the inverters.
   Time-domain switching-level simulation results for a 45-kW microgrid
   with 33\% PV penetration demonstrate the merits of the proposed
   technique; in particular they show that the load voltage can be
   maintained between prescribed bounds in spite of variations in incident
   irradiance and step changes in the load.}},

Abstract = {{Using recycled materials in pavement applications is a viable option to
   reduce costs and limit the environmental impact of road construction.
   During the past decades, many agencies in the U.S. have investigated the
   effect on pavement performance of adding Reclaimed Asphalt Pavement
   (RAP), and, more recently, Recycled Asphalt Shingles (RAS) to asphalt
   mixtures, and limits were proposed on the amount of recycled materials
   which can be used. This paper investigates the effect of adding both RAP
   and RAS to virgin asphalt mixtures by means of a simple low temperature
   creep test performed on asphalt mixture beams. From the experimental
   work, creep stiffness, m-value, thermal stress and critical cracking
   temperature are calculated and compared statistically and graphically.
   Based on the results, it is concluded that most of the mixtures prepared
   with combinations of RAP and RAS perform similarly to standard mixtures
   at low temperature. For a limited number of mixtures, a negative effect
   is observed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the possibility of developing low temperature
   limit criteria for asphalt mixtures, similarly to what is currently
   available in the standard specification for asphalt binder. The
   investigation is based on extensive experimental work that includes
   Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) creep tests on asphalt binders and asphalt
   mixtures at low temperature and on semi-empirical Hirsch model, and on
   the rheological model proposed by Christensen, Anderson and Marasteanu
   (CAM). Limiting asphalt mixture creep stiffness values are predicted
   from Pressure Aging Vessel (PAV; Long term aging) binder creep stiffness
   data and are next compared with results available in literature. Then,
   BBR creep data for Rolling Thin-Film Oven Test (RTFOT; Short term aging)
   asphalt binder are used to predict creep stiffness of the corresponding
   short term aged asphalt mixtures. Based on these results, a range of
   limiting stiffness values is obtained. Due to large variations in the
   calculated slopes of the mixture creep stiffness curves, a limiting
   value for the relaxation parameter m-value could not be recommended.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{577-583}},
Abstract = {{Stored red blood cells (RBCs) show progressive deformability changes
   during blood banking/ storage. Their deformability changes over an 8
   weeks' storage period were measured using a microfluidic device.
   Hydrodynamic focusing controls the orientation and position of
   individual RBCs within the microchannel. High-speed imaging (5000 frames
   s(-1)) captures the dynamic deformation behavior of the cells, and
   together with automated image analysis, enables the characterization of
   over 1000 RBCs within 3 minutes. Multiple parameters including
   deformation index (DI), time constant (shape recovery rate), and RBC
   circularity were quantified. Compared to previous studies on stored RBC
   deformability, our results include a significantly higher number of
   cells (>1000 cells per sample vs. a few to tens of cells per sample)
   and, for the first time, reveal deformation changes of stored RBCs when
   traveling through human-capillary-like microchannels. Contrary to
   existing knowledge, our results demonstrate that the deformation index
   of RBCs under folding does not change significantly over blood storage.
   However, significant differences exist in time constants and circularity
   distribution widths, which can be used to quantify stored RBC quality or
   age.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{524-533}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a high
   resolution imaging technique that generates excellent contrast based on
   intrinsic optical properties of the tissue, such as neurons and fibers.
   The SD-OCT data acquisition is performed directly on the tissue block,
   diminishing the need for cutting, mounting and staining. We utilized
   SD-OCT to visualize the laminar structure of the isocortex and compared
   cortical cytoarchitecture with the gold standard Nissl staining, both
   qualitatively and quantitatively. In histological processing,
   distortions routinely affect registration to the blockface image and
   prevent accurate 3D reconstruction of regions of tissue. We compared
   blockface registration to SD-OCT and Nissl, respectively, and found that
   SD-OCT-blocicface registration was significantly more accurate than
   Nissl-blocicface registration. Two independent observers manually
   labeled cortical laminae (e.g. III, IV and V) in SD-OCT images and Nissl
   stained sections. Our results show that OCT images exhibit sufficient
   contrast in the cortex to reliably differentiate the cortical layers.
   Furthermore, the modalities were compared with regard to cortical
   laminar organization and showed good agreement. Taken together, these
   SD-OCT results suggest that SD-OCT contains information comparable to
   standard histological stains such as Nissl in terms of distinguishing
   cortical layers and architectonic areas. Given these data, we propose
   that SD-OCT can be used to reliably generate 3D reconstructions of
   multiple cubic centimeters of cortex that can be used to accurately and
   semi-automatically perform standard histological analyses. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{We describe a serial optical coherence scanner (SOCS) for high
   resolution imaging of ex-vivo brain. SOCS integrates a multi-contrast
   optical coherence tomography and a vibratome slicer to establish
   comprehensive brain anatomy and fiber pathways in three-dimensional
   space. Rat brain images are demonstrated by utilizing intrinsic optical
   contrasts including back-scattering, birefringence and optic axis
   orientation, which are simultaneously generated from the same dataset.
   Volumetric images from serial scans are combined to realize large scale
   brain maps. Nerve fiber tracts are globally described in 3D by
   retardance, and delicately delineated by cross-polarization at the
   resolution of 15 x 15 x 5.5 mu m(3). In-plane orientations of the tracts
   are quantified by optic axis orientation. SOCS offers a new solution for
   complete reconstructions of macroscopic tissues such as primate and
   human brains at microscopic resolution. The technique also opens up
   varieties of opportunities for connectome studies and systematic
   investigations on neurological diseases and brain disorders. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Granulation behavior of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC) in the presence
   of 2.5\% polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) was systematically studied. Complex
   changes in flowability and tabletability of lubricated MCC granules are
   correlated to changes in intragranular porosity, morphology, surface
   smoothness, size distribution, and specific surface area (SSA). With
   2.5\% PVP, the use of 45\% granulation water leads to 84\% reduction in
   tablet tensile strength and 76\% improvement in powder flow factor. The
   changes in powder performance are explained by granule densification and
   surface smoothing. The granulating water level corresponding to the
   onset of overgranulation, 45\%, is significantly lower than the 70\%
   water required for unlubricated MCC granules without PVP. At more than
   45\% water levels, MCC-PVP granules flow well but cannot be compressed
   into intact tablets. Such changes in powder performance correspond to
   the rapid growth into large and dense spheres with smooth surface.
   Compared with MCC alone, the onset of the phase of fast granule size
   enlargement occurs at a lower water level when 2.5\% PVP is used.
   Although the use of 2.5\% PVP hastens granule nucleation and growth
   rate, the mechanisms of overgranulation are the same, that is, size
   enlargement, granule densification, surface smoothing, and particle
   rounding in both systems. (c) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. and the

Title = {{Finite weakest-link model of lifetime distribution of quasibrittle
   structures under fatigue loading}},
Journal = {{MATHEMATICS AND MECHANICS OF SOLIDS}},

Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{1, SI}},
Pages = {{56-70}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The design of various engineering structures, such as buildings,
   infrastructure, aircraft, ships, as well as microelectronic components
   and medical implants, must ensure an extremely low probability of
   failure during their service lifetime. Since such a low probability is
   beyond the means of histogram testing, we must rely on some physically
   based probabilistic model for the statistics of structural lifetime.
   Attention is focused on structures consisting of quasibrittle materials.
   These are brittle materials with inhomogeneities that are not negligible
   compared with the structure size, as exemplified by concrete, fiber
   composites, tough ceramics, rocks, sea ice, bone, wood, and many more at
   the micro- or nano-scale. This paper presents a finite weakest-link
   model of the fatigue lifetime of quasibrittle structures that fail at
   the fracture of one representative volume element (RVE). In this model,
   the probability distribution of critical stress amplitude is first
   derived by assuming a prescribed number of loading cycles and a fixed
   stress ratio. The probability distribution of fatigue lifetime is then
   deduced from the probability distribution of critical stress amplitude
   through the Paris law for fatigue crack growth. It is shown that the
   present theory matches well with the experimentally measured lifetime
   histograms of various engineering and dental ceramics, which
   systematically deviate from the two-parameter Weibull distribution. The
   theory indicates that the mean fatigue lifetime of quasibrittle
   structures must strongly depend on the structure size and geometry.
   Finally, the present model indicates that the probability distribution
   of fatigue lifetime can be determined from the mean size effect
   analysis.}},

Abstract = {{The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon is the most widely used DNA
   transposon in genetic applications and is the only DNA transposon thus
   far in clinical trials for human gene therapy. In the absence of atomic
   level structural information, the development of SB transposon relied
   primarily on the biochemical and genetic homology data. While these
   studies were successful and have yielded hyperactive transposases,
   structural information is needed to gain a mechanistic understanding of
   transposase activity and guides to further improvement. We have
   initiated a structural study of SB transposase using Nuclear Magnetic
   Resonance (NMR) and Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to investigate
   the properties of the DNA-binding domain of SB transposase in solution.
   We show that at physiologic salt concentrations, the SB DNA-binding
   domain remains mostly unstructured but its N-terminal PAI subdomain
   forms a compact, three-helical structure with a helix-turn-helix motif
   at higher concentrations of NaCl. Furthermore, we show that the
   full-length SB DNA-binding domain associates differently with inner and
   outer binding sites of the transposon DNA. We also show that the PAI
   subdomain of SB DNA-binding domain has a dominant role in transposase's
   attachment to the inverted terminal repeats of the transposon DNA.
   Overall, our data validate several earlier predictions and provide new
   insights on how SB transposase recognizes transposon DNA.

Abstract = {{Transparent conductive oxide layers are widely used in various

   or substrate biasing. The films deposited at various oxygen
   concentrations were approximately 500 nm thick, were pin-hole free and
   well adhered to the glass substrates. The material characteristics of
   the films were analysed using X-ray diffraction, four point probe, hot
   probe, UV-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and profilometry.
   Structural and electrical analyses revealed that the films were
   crystalline and highly conductive when sputtered in the absence of
   oxygen but a dramatic change in resistivity was observed when oxygen was
   introduced during the deposition. Resistivity increased from 0.004 Omega
   cm (no oxygen) to 5 Omega cm with 10\% oxygen. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

Abstract = {{Given a definition of change and a dataset about spatiotemporal (ST)
   phenomena, ST change footprint discovery is the process of identifying
   the location and/or time of such changes from the dataset. Change
   footprint discovery is fundamentally important for the study of climate
   change, the tracking of disease, and many other applications. Methods
   for detecting change footprints have emerged from a diverse set of
   research areas, ranging from time series analysis and remote sensing to
   spatial statistics. Researchers have much to learn from one another, but
   are stymied by inconsistent use of terminology and varied definitions of
   change across disciplines. Existing reviews focus on discovery methods
   for only one or a few types of change footprints (e.g., point change in
   a time series). To facilitate sharing of insights across disciplines, we
   conducted a multi-disciplinary review of ST change patterns and their
   respective discovery methods. We developed a taxonomy of possible ST
   change footprints and classified our review findings accordingly. This
   exercise allowed us to identify gaps in the research that we consider
   ripe for exploration, most notably change pattern discovery in vector ST
   datasets. In addition, we illustrate how such pattern discovery might
   proceed using two case studies from historical GIS. (C) 2013 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Low-rank matrix completion methods have been successful in a variety of
   settings such as recommendation systems. However, most of the existing
   matrix completion methods only provide a point estimate of missing
   entries, and do not characterize uncertainties of the predictions. In
   this paper, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical probabilistic matrix
   factorization (BHPMF) model to 1) incorporate hierarchical side
   information, and 2) provide uncertainty quantified predictions. The
   former yields significant performance improvements in the problem of
   plant trait prediction, a key problem in ecology, by leveraging the
   taxonomic hierarchy in the plant kingdom. The latter is helpful in
   identifying predictions of low confidence which can in turn be used to
   guide field work for data collection efforts. A Gibbs sampler is
   designed for inference in the model. Further, we propose a multiple
   inheritance BHPMF (MI-BHPMF) which can work with a general directed
   acyclic graph (DAG) structured hierarchy, rather than a tree. We present
   comprehensive experimental results on the problem of plant trait
   prediction using the largest database of plant traits, where BHPMF shows
   strong empirical performance in uncertainty quantified trait prediction,
   outperforming the state-of-the-art based on point estimates. Further, we
   show that BHPMF is more accurate when it is confident, whereas the error
   is high when the uncertainty is high.}},

Abstract = {{Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) provide an attractive option for
   extracting data-level parallelism from diverse applications. However,
   some applications, although possess abundant data-level parallelism,
   exhibit irregular memory access patterns to the shared data structures.
   Porting such applications to GPUs requires synchronization mechanisms
   such as locks, which significantly increase the programming complexity.
   Coarse-grained locking, where a single lock controls all the shared
   resources, although reduces programming efforts, can substantially
   serialize GPU threads. On the other hand, fine-grained locking, where
   each data element is protected by an independent lock, although
   facilitates maximum parallelism, requires significant programming
   efforts. To overcome these challenges, we propose to support software
   transactional memory (STM) on GPU that is able to achieve performance
   comparable to fine-grained locking, while requiring minimal programming
   efforts. Software-based transactional execution can incur significant
   run-time overheads due to activities such as detecting conflicts across
   thousands of GPU threads and managing a consistent memory state. Thus,
   in this paper we illustrate three lightweight STM designs that are
   capable of scaling to a large number of GPU threads. In our system,
   programmers simply mark the critical sections in the applications, and
   the underlying STM support is able to achieve performance comparable to
   fine-grained locking.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a compiler extension to our prototype extensible C
   translator that adds new features for parallel execution of matrix
   operations and shows their application to problems in spatio-temporal
   data mining. The extension provides new language features for
   constructing new matrices, mapping functions over elements of a matrix,
   and accumulating operations that, for example, can sum values in a
   matrix. It also provides the appropriate semantic analysis to check for
   errors before translating the constructs down to parallel C code.
   The extension also provides features that let the programmer indicate
   how the extension translates these matrix constructs down to C code.
   Programmers seeking higher levels of performance can specify how the
   underlying for-loops are structured so that code using, for example,
   loop-tiling techniques or vector processors, is generated.
   In general, compiler extensions supported by our approach allow new
   domain-specific syntax and semantic analyses to be easily added to the
   host language. Specifications of the host C language and the extensions
   are composed to create a custom translator that maps extended C programs
   down to plain (parallel) C code, checking for domain-specific errors and
   applying high-level domain-specific optimizations in the process.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider exact-repair distributed storage systems.
   Characterizing the optimal storage-vs-repair bandwidth tradeoff for such
   systems remains an open problem, in general with results available in
   the literature for very specific instances. We characterize the optimal
   tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth if in addition to
   exact-repair requirements, an additional requirement of pair-wise
   symmetry on the repair process is imposed. The optimal tradeoff
   surprisingly consists of only one efficient point, namely the minimum
   bandwidth regenerating (MBR) point. These results are also extended to
   the case in which the stored data (or repair data) must be secure from
   an external wiretapper, and the correspondingly optimal secure tradeoffs
   are also characterized. The main technical tool used in the converse
   proofs is a use of Han's inequality for sub-sets of random variables.
   Finally, we also present results in which the pair-wise symmetry
   constraint is relaxed and a new converse bound is obtained for the case
   of exact repair in which an external adversary can access the repair
   data of any one node. This bound improves upon the existing best known
   results for the secure and exact repair problem.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel and robust Sliding Mode Control (SMC)
   technique for hysteresis linearization of a stack actuated piezoelectric
   micro/nano positioner. This work documents a classical second order Dahl
   model to capture the effects of rate dependent hysteresis. An advantage
   of this model is its easier implementation and better depiction of
   asymmetric hysteresis loops than a same order Bouc-Wen model. In
   existing works on SMC with piezoelectric actuators, Dahl model has
   received scant attention. In contrast, this work explores second order
   Dahl model as a candidate for SMC implementation. The proposed approach
   is unique in the sense that it does not need a separate hysteresis
   observer. The stability of the controller is verified by Lyapunov
   stability analysis and zero steady state error is theoretically proved.
   SMC strategy accounts for the uncertain hysteresis as well as
   unanticipated fluctuations in the input. Simulation results establish
   the trajectory tracking robustness and effectiveness of the proposed
   control technique.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a new Cardiac Electrical Sparse Imaging (CESI) technique to
   image cardiac activation throughout the three-dimensional (3D)

   the aid of heart-torso geometry. Sparse property of cardiac electrical
   activity along time is utilized in the temporal sparse inverse problem.
   Computer simulations were carried out to evaluate the performance of
   this imaging method under various circumstances. A total of 12 single
   site pacing simulations with various noise/disturbance were employed to
   evaluate the accuracy, stability and robustness of the technique. The
   imaged activation sequence is compared with the simulated ones and those
   from the conventional weighted minimum norm method. The results show
   that CESI outperformed the conventional method. In summary, we have
   proposed a novel method for cardiac activation imaging, and our results
   suggest that CESI has enhanced performance and has the potential to
   image ventricular activation and assist in clinical management of
   ventricular arrhythmias.}},

   from the ECD magnitude. A total of 114 sites of transmural infarctions,
   91 sites of epicardial infarctions, and 36 sites of endocardial
   infarctions were simulated. The results show that: 1) With 205 BSPM
   electrodes and 10 mu V Gaussian white noise, the averaged accuracies for
   transmural MI are sensitivity = 83.4\%, specificity = 82.2\%, and the
   distance between the centers of gravity (DCG) = 6.5mm. Epicardial
   infarctions (sensitivity = 81.6\%, specificity = 75.8\%, and DCG =
   7.5mm) obtained similar accuracies to endocardial infarctions
   (sensitivity = 80.0\%, specificity = 77.0\%, and DCG = 10.4 mm). A
   reasonably good imaging performance was obtained under a higher noise
   level, fewer BSPM electrodes, and mild volume conductor modeling error,

Abstract = {{Integrated with low-power micro-controllers and sensors, RFID-based
   wireless rechargeable sensor node is a very promising platform for
   applications such as inventory management, supply chain monitoring etc.
   Among other major research challenges, one of the most essential
   problems in such wireless rechargeable sensor networks is how to
   minimize the communication delay among RFID readers and RFID-based
   rechargeable nodes. While the existing works have mostly focused on the
   collision avoidance among RFID-based nodes, in this work we study an
   orthogonal approach which focuses on how to optimally plan the movement
   of the reader so as to minimize the communication delay in the network.
   To solve this problem, we introduce both an optimal solution for the
   linear reader movement pattern and an approximation solution for the
   generic two-dimensional reader move pattern with a provable
   approximation ratio. In addition, we also provide a solution for
   guaranteeing the quality of communication while minimizing the
   communication delay. We verify our observations through testbed
   experiments and extensively evaluate our design by both emulations and
   large-scale simulations. The results show our design can effectively
   reduce communication delay in wireless rechargeable sensor networks when
   compared with baseline solutions.}},

   exploring compressible gas dynamics problems of interest in

   coevolved with the availability of a series of high performance

   advanced with the architectural capabilities and characteristics of
   these machines. This adaptability of our PPM codes has enabled targeted
   astrophysical applications of PPM to exploit these scarce resources to

   this was accomplished, and set a path forward, with a new miniapp, mPPM,

Abstract = {{In wireless sensor networks (WSNs), existing work on flooding mainly
   focuses on single-packet problem, while work in sequential multi-packet
   problem is surprisingly little. This paper proposes OppCode, a new
   opportunistic network-coding-based flooding architecture for
   multi-packet dissemination in WSNs, where both unreliable and correlated
   links commonly exist. Instead of flooding a single packet each time,
   each node encodes multiple native packets chosen from a specific
   fixed-size page to an encoded packet, and then rebroadcasts it further.
   The key idea consists of two parts: one is opportunistically coding
   decision, in which each node grasps every possible coding opportunity
   greedily to conduct an encode-and-forward operation in order to maximize
   its total (or aggregate) coding gain of all neighbors based on the
   probabilistic estimations of packets each neighbor already has (i.e.,
   coverage); the other is paged collective acknowledgements (ACKs), in
   which one rebroadcast that arrives at a receiver acts as not only an
   implicit ACK of successful disseminations of all packets in the entire
   page for the sender, but also probabilistic ACK to update page-scale
   per-packet coverage estimations for its neighbors in a batch. We
   evaluate our design using extensive simulations and on a 20-node WSNs
   testbed, and show that OppCode largely increases performance of
   multi-packet flooding compared with state-of-the-art solutions,
   especially when links are highly unreliable and correlated with each
   other. The gains vary from a few percent to several folds depending on
   the network density, link conditions, coverage threshold and page size.}},

Abstract = {{Despite almost 50 years of research on the use of microbubbles as
   ultrasound contrast agents (UCAs), the promise of high resolution
   dynamic perfusion imaging has not been fulfilled. This is due to the
   fact that the echogenicity enhancements from small clusters of bubbles
   in microvessels remain difficult to detect in the presence strong tissue
   echogenicity. A well-known pulse inversion (PI) method has been
   successful in exploiting the nonlinear behavior of UCAs and has led to
   enhanced myocardium and vascular imaging procedures. However, PI imaging
   has limited dynamic range due to noise amplification (fundamentally a
   subtraction method) We have recently proposed the use of the
   post-beamforming Volterra filter for separation of linear and non-linear
   echoes and maintaining very high dynamic range in addition to effective
   suppression of additive Gaussian noise. This method was shown to match
   or exceed the performance of PI imaging in static imaging of UCAs in
   flow phantoms. In this paper, we present in vivo results of UCA imaging
   using the cubic component of a third-order Volterra filter, together
   with a pixel-wise estimate of a temporal-perfusion index (TPI). We show
   that the TPI can be designed as a spatio-temporal estimator of the
   perfusion activity to provide separation between UCA activity and
   changes due to tissue motion due to breathing and/or pulsation. This is
   achieved using UCA injections with clinically-relevant concentrations
   and imaging at normal scanner setting, i.e. no sacrifice of bandwidth as
   may be necessary when using PI imaging. The results also demonstrate the
   high resolution nature of TPI imaging in both axial and lateral
   dimensions.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetoacoustic tomography with magnetic induction (MAT-MI) is an
   emerging technique, which collects ultrasound signals by inducing
   Lorentz force-based vibrations inside biological tissues to reconstruct
   electrical impedance properties with high spatial resolution. However,
   previous MAT-MI imaging systems only acquired small amplitudes of
   ultrasound signals as biological tissues are poor conductors of
   electricity, which limits the generated eddy current. In this work, we
   report our pilot MAT-MI experimental study in a magnetic resonance
   imaging scanner. The present experimental results suggest that MAT-MI
   under high static magnetic field environment is able to differentiate
   tissue electrical impedance with improved imaging contrast.}},

Abstract = {{Tags, as high quality semantic descriptors, are used in categorization,
   clustering and efficient retrieval of various items in the web corpus.
   Images, videos, songs and similar multimedia items are the most common
   items which are tagged either manually or in a semi-automatic manner.
   However, the tagging process becomes complicated when the content
   structure of an item is not interpretable. Such a problems occurs in
   items like scientific research datasets or documents with very little
   text content. In this work, we propose a generalized approach to
   automate tag expansion for such low-content items. We leverage
   intelligence of the web to generate secondary content for such items for
   the tag expansion process. While automating tag expansion, we also
   address the problem of topic drift by automating removal of the noisy
   tags from the set of candidate new tags. The effectiveness of the
   proposed approach is tested on a real world dataset. The performance of
   the proposed is compared with Wikipedia based nearest neighbor tagging
   (WikiSem) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based tag
   expansion approaches. Based on the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) metric,
   the proposed approach was twice as accurate as the WikiSem baseline
   (0.27 vs 0.13) and at least 2.25 times the NMF baselines (0.27 vs 0.12).}},

Abstract = {{Understanding dynamics of evolution in large social networks is an
   important problem. In this paper, we characterize evolution in large
   multi-relational social networks. The proliferation of online media such
   as Twitter, Facebook, Orkut and MMORPGs(1) have created social
   networking data at an unprecedented scale. Sony's Everquest II is one
   such example. We used game multi-relational networks to reveal the
   dynamics of evolution in a multi-relational setting by macroscopic study
   of the game network. Macroscopic analysis involves fragmenting the
   network into smaller portions for studying the dynamics within these
   sub-networks, referred to as `communities'. From an evolutionary
   perspective of multi-relational network analysis, we have made the
   following contributions. Specifically, we formulated and analyzed
   various metrics to capture evolutionary properties of networks. We find
   that co-evolution rates in trust based `communities' are approximately
   60\% higher than the trade based `communities'. We also find that the
   trust and trade connections within the `communities' reduce as their
   size increases. Finally, we study the interrelation between the dynamics
   of trade and trust within `communities' and find interesting results
   about the precursor relationship between the trade and the trust
   dynamics within the `communities'.}},

Abstract = {{Scientific datasets play a crucial role in data-driven research. While,
   several search tools are developed for searching documents, blogs,
   images, videos and various other information needs, important scientific
   artifacts like research datasets lack this prerogative. The main
   challenge faced in developing an effective search tool for datasets is
   to determine the content representation of the raw data. Dataset
   description provided by users is often very content-specific and short.
   Moreover, even the public datasets generally have very limited
   description about the various research problems/applications that used
   them. Given the ever expanding variety of datasets on the web and the
   lack of representative content for the purpose of indexing, the task of
   developing an effective search engine for dataset is computationally
   very challenging. In this work, we propose a novel `context' based
   paradigm of search for dataset to overcome the problem of limited
   representative content for research datasets. In contrast to any general
   purpose search engine which index the `little' text information about
   the dataset sources, we hypothesized that the proposed paradigm of
   `context' based search is more effective for dataset search. The
   hypothesis is tested by conducting a user study. The performance of the
   context based search (DataGopher) is compared with a popular general
   purpose search engine. The study was conducted in a real world setting
   where user are free to use the search engine as per the information
   need. Based on the user study, we find that the performance of
   DataGopher was favored for 58\% of the total context based user queries
   whereas the baseline was only 26\%.}},

Abstract = {{In wireless networks, duty-cycling operations have been widely used to
   reduce the energy cost of RF idle listening at wireless receivers. Such
   operations, however, introduce delays in data forwarding because a
   sender has to wait for a targeted receiver to wake up. To reduce
   end-to-end delivery delays, researchers have proposed scheduling
   techniques {[}1], {[}2], {[}3] to wake up nodes along the data
   forwarding path at the right moment. However, these techniques consider
   only one-way delivery from a sink to nodes (or vice versa), failing to
   optimally support round-trip network operations such as (i) query and
   response, (ii) command and control and (iii) data fetching.
   In this work, we interestingly reveal that the optimal round-trip delay
   in a low-duty-cycle network depends only on (i) duty cycle period and
   (ii) the number of 2-connected network components between the source and
   destination nodes. We prove that optimality in the round-trip delay can
   be achieved by establishing a simple circular path and its related
   cords, in which nodes are assigned wake-up slots in an ascending order
   in each network component, and connecting these paths into a circular
   pipeline. We compared our Circular Pipelining (CP) algorithm with the
   state-of-art solutions {[}3], and the experimental results show that
   without using circular forwarding, existing solutions have a round-trip
   delay proportional to the network diameter, while CP remains a minimal
   constant delay of T as long as the network is 2-connected. We also
   implement the Circular Pipelining (CP) algorithm in a testbed consisting
   of 30 MICAz nodes, achieving significant delay reduction compared to
   three baseline solutions in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Diversity-based protocols such as network coding and opportunistic
   routing have been proposed in recent years to exploit spatial diversity
   in wireless communication. By utilizing concurrent links, these
   protocols achieve significantly better performance than traditional
   approaches. However, they explicitly or implicitly assume that wireless
   links are independent, which overestimates the true spatial diversity in
   reality. For the first time, this paper analyzes the impact of link
   correlation on network coding and introduces Correlated Coding, a link
   correlation-aware design that seeks to optimize the transmission
   efficiency by maximizing necessary coding opportunities. Correlated
   coding uses only one-hop information, which makes it work in a fully
   distributed manner and introduces minimal communication overhead. The
   highlight of our design is its broad applicability and effectiveness. We
   implement our design with four broadcast protocols and three unicast
   protocols, and evaluate them extensively with one 802.11 testbed and
   three 802.15.4 testbeds running TelosB, MICAz, and GreenOrbs nodes. The
   experiment results show that (i) more coding opportunities do not lead
   to more transmission benefits, and (ii) compared to coding aware
   protocols, the number of coding operations is reduced while the
   transmission efficiency is improved.}},

Abstract = {{We present here a transaction management protocol using causal snapshot
   isolation in partially replicated multi-version databases. We consider
   here replicated databases consisting of multiple disjoint data
   partitions. A partition is not required to be replicated at all database
   sites, and a site may contain replicas for any number of partitions.
   Transactions can execute at any site and read or write data from any
   subset of the partitions, and its updates are propagated asynchronously
   to other sites. The protocol ensures that the snapshot observed by a
   transaction contains data versions that are causally consistent. The
   protocol requires propagating updates only to the sites replicating the
   updated items. In developing this protocol, we address the issues that
   are unique in supporting transactions with causal consistency together
   with the snapshot isolation model in partially replicated databases.
   Through experimental evaluations, we demonstrate the scalability of this
   model and its performance benefits over full replication models.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose and present a novel unsupervised change

   sparse reconstrnction technique is introduced to generate a de-noised,
   low time consuming reconstrncted image by using K-SVD dictionary
   learning. In order to obtain proper difference image, minus and ratio
   maps are discussed with the comparison of the other state-of-the-art
   approaches. Finally, to transfer the difference map into change map, we
   employ the optimized FCM called FLICM algorithm to undertake the task
   which aims to segment the difference map into two classes: changed and
   unchanged. Experimental results clearly show that the proposed approach
   consistently yields superior performance (accuracy, efficiency and
   robustness) compared to several well-known change detection techniques
   on both noise-free and noisy satellite images, further optimization
   methods are discusses in the end.}},

Abstract = {{In this work we measure the exciton diffusion length (L-D) of the
   electron donor material boron subphthalocyanine chloride (SubPc) as a
   function of concentration in a wide energy gap host material,
   effectively modulating the intermolecular separation. It is shown that
   the L-D of neat SubPc (L-D = 10.7 nm) can be increased by similar to
   50\% at a concentration of 25 wt. \% (L-D = 15.4 nm). The enhancement in
   L-D is attributed to the optimization of the parameters that control
   Forster energy transfer. Furthermore, we show that enhanced L-D can be
   translated to dilute donor OPVs that demonstrate an enhanced power
   efficiency of eta(P) = 4.4\%, a similar to 30\% increase relative to OPV
   devices based on neat SubPc and rivaling the efficiency of corresponding
   bulk heterojunction devices based on SubPc and C-60. Kinetic Monte Carlo
   modeling of exciton dynamics in these devices suggests that optimal
   incorporation of dilute donor layers with enhanced L-D depends
   intimately on the interface. Specifically, an imbalance in energy
   transfer across the dilute donor interface imparts inhomogeneity in the
   energy transfer landscape, dramatically affecting exciton motion.
   Overall, this work highlights the opportunity for designing future
   organic semiconductors that have longer L-D as well as OPV architectures
   that are directly optimized for enhanced exciton diffusion.}},

Abstract = {{Copper indium gallium diselenide (CIGS) based solar cells have shown

   efficiency at similar to 1.3 eV and any further increase in the Ga
   concentration and band gap results in lower efficiencies due to bulk and
   interfacial traps. This also prevents the use of wide band gap CIGS
   layer as a top cell for harvesting the solar cell spectrum in a tandem
   cell configuration. This paper reports the manufacturing challenges on

Abstract = {{This paper develops observer design techniques in a unified framework
   for both time invariant and parameter varying Lipschitz nonlinear
   systems that are differentiable w.r.t. state variables. First, a new
   sufficient condition for asymptotic convergence is developed for both
   the extended Luenberger observer and a two-DOF nonlinear observer for
   time-invariant nonlinear systems. In addition to ensuring asymptotic
   convergence, extension of this observer design technique to optimization
   of a L2 performance criterion is presented, which enables the observer
   to handle the unknown disturbance inputs as well as ensure robustness to
   model uncertainty. Next, augmentation of this technique to parameter
   varying nonlinear (PVNL) systems is developed. Different from methods
   suggested in the LPV literature, a simple but non-conservative finite
   dimensional relaxation method for quadratic parameter dependent LMIs is
   presented. These results constitute perhaps the first systematic
   observer design methodology in literature for PVNL systems. Finally, a
   simulation result for vehicle slip angle estimation is presented to
   verify the performance of the developed observer design methods.}},

   utilizing suitable families of test functions, we develop a
   weakly-continuous metric that is analogous to the Wasserstein metric and

   compare this metric to certain standard alternatives including a
   different version of a matricial Wasserstein metric developed in {[}1],

Abstract = {{In microgrids that are predominantly resistive, real and reactive power
   can be controlled by implementation of voltage and frequency droop laws
   respectively. However, the variable frequency displayed by such a system
   complicates analysis such that design approaches rely on approximations
   and linearized models. In this work, we present a modified form of droop
   control where only the voltage versus real power relationship is upheld
   and the frequency is held constant. Since the frequency is not
   explicitly controlled and the reactive power is not measured, the
   controller can be simplified. In such a setting, the only assumption we
   make is that all inverters have access to a common time-reference.
   Because fixed frequency operation is enforced by design, a variety of
   analytical tools can be leveraged to formulate a comprehensive
   analytical framework which facilitates a precise design methodology. In
   particular, closed-form expressions on the output current phase
   differences are obtained which yield practical selection guidelines on
   the voltage-power droop gains such that reactive flows between inverters
   are kept small. As a corollary, it is demonstrated that there are no
   reactive power flows in the presence of purely resistive loads. For the
   particular case of a single inverter, an almost exact solution
   describing the nonlinear dynamics of the inverter output voltage,
   current, and power are derived. Accompanying simulation results validate
   the analytical results and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed
   control approach.}},

Abstract = {{Microgrids formed by a network of power sources and power consumers
   yield significant advantages over the conventional power grid including
   proximity of power consumption to power generation, distributed
   generation, resiliency against wide area blackouts and ease of
   incorporation of renewable energy sources. On the other hand, unlike the
   conventional grid, microgrids are compliant where a single load or a
   single generation unit can often form a significant fraction of the
   total generation capacity. Here large excursions from the nominal
   operating conditions are possible motivating the need for safety
   mechanisms which isolate power electronic equipment from damage.
   Breakers serve the purpose of protecting equipment from surge conditions
   by shutting off, for example, generation units. However in microgrids, a
   loss of a single generation unit can have catastrophic impact on the
   viability of the entire system. Here settings on breakers cannot be
   chosen too conservatively to protect the equipment at the expense of
   system viability or too liberally which will result in equipment damage.
   The ensuing problem of striking a suitable compromise tends to be
   combinatoric in nature due to numerous states of breakers which is
   further exacerbated by an uncertain load profile and nonlinear nature of
   system dynamics. In this article we provide a methodology to determine
   current thresholds and guard times, the time interval when current is
   allowed to exceed threshold value, for each inverter for fail-safe
   operation of microgrid. We employ a machine learning approach to address
   the problem where we first demonstrate that conventional support vector
   machine (SVM) methodology does not yield a satisfactory solution. We
   then develop a one-sided SVM method and generalize it to yield nonlinear
   support boundaries which captures the need for fail-safe operation
   against system blackouts while protecting equipment. A simulation engine
   is developed to model a real microgrid which is used to generate data
   for assessing and guiding our approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents robust position tracking control of an
   electro-hydraulic camless engine valve actuator with the reference of
   time-varying frequency. The valve actuator includes nonlinearities
   associated with the hydraulic flow and the nonlinear friction. To retain
   such nonlinearities, the stabilized valve actuator is modeled as a
   block-structured system using the Volterra series representation. For
   tracking control design, the extended generating dynamics, which is
   justified by frequency domain analysis of a feedback system, is applied
   to the robust time-varying tracking control which is based on the
   internal model principle. The given tracking control method is
   illustrated by both simulation and experiments. With the extended
   generating dynamics, tracking the reference of time-varying frequency
   shows significant improvement.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of the optimal selection of a subset of
   available sensors or actuators in large-scale dynamical systems. By
   replacing a combinatorial penalty on the number of sensors or actuators
   with a convex sparsity-promoting term, we cast this problem as a
   semidefinite program. The solution of the resulting convex optimization
   problem is used to select sensors (actuators) in order to gracefully
   degrade performance relative to the optimal Kalman filter (Linear
   Quadratic Regulator) that uses all available sensing (actuating)
   capabilities. We employ the alternating direction method of multipliers
   to develop a customized algorithm that is well-suited for large-scale
   problems. Our algorithm scales better than standard SDP solvers with
   respect to both the state dimension and the number of available sensors

Abstract = {{In optimal prediction as well as in optimal smoothing the variance of
   the optimal estimator is impacted predominantly by the frequency
   segments where the power spectrum is small or negligible. Indeed, the
   Szego's celebrated theorem characterizes deterministic process as those
   whose power spectral density fails to be log-integrable by virtue of
   sufficiently flat spectral zeros. Likewise Kolmogorov's formula gives an
   analogous condition for optimal smoothing. We discuss how the flatness
   of spectral zeros suggests a nested stratification of families of
   spectral where estimation of a stochastic process over a window of a
   given size is possible with negligible variance based on observations
   outside the interval. We then focus on the more general problem of
   estimating missing data in observation records which are not necessarily
   contiguous. A key result in the paper (Theorem 3) provides a sufficient
   condition for being able to estimate missing data with arbitrarily small
   error variance, in terms of the flatness of the spectral zeros.}},

Abstract = {{A robust synthesis algorithm is proposed for a class of uncertain linear
   parameter varying (LPV) systems. The uncertain system is described as an
   interconnection of a nominal (not-uncertain) LPV system and an
   uncertainty whose input/output behavior is described by an integral
   quadratic constraint (IQC). The proposed algorithm is a coordinate-wise
   ascent that is similar to the well-known DK iteration for mu-synthesis.
   In the first step, a nominal controller is designed for the LPV system
   without uncertainties. In the second step, the robustness of the
   designed controller is evaluated and a new scaled plant for the next
   synthesis step is created. The robust performance condition used in the
   analysis step is formulated as a dissipation inequality that
   incorporates the IQC and generalizes the Bounded Real Lemma like
   condition for performance of nominal LPV systems. Both steps can be
   formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP) and efficiently solved using
   available optimization software. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method is demonstrated on a simple numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{The main duty of key management is to keep cryptographic keys in secret.
   However, it is difficulty to quantitatively assess that how well does a
   key management scheme protect the keys. In this paper, we propose to use
   reliability theory, which was mainly used to evaluate performance
   persistence for engineering systems, to estimate the performance of key
   management schemes.
   The reliability analysis leads to counter-intuitive results such as the
   widely deployed periodic key update scheme is ineffective when key
   thefts are possible. The analysis also shows that using password with an
   electronic security token for authentication is a strong security
   measure in the beginning but is unreliable in the long run. In general,
   the reliability analysis demonstrates that current key management
   schemes focus too much on postponing the first key theft from occurring
   but lack of considerations on quickly recovering stolen keys. In the
   later part of this paper, we discuss possible directions that may
   improve the reliability of key management schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) is the core component in a smart
   grid that exhibits a highly complex network configuration. AMI shares
   information about consumption, outages, and electricity rates reliably

   utilities. However, the numerous smart meters being connected through
   mesh networks open new opportunities for attackers to interfere with
   communications and compromise utilities assets or steal customers
   private information.
   In this paper, we present a new DoS attack, called puppet attack, which
   can result in denial of service in AMI network. The intruder can select
   any normal node as a puppet node and send attack packets to this puppet
   node. When the puppet node receives these attack packets, this node will
   be controlled by the attacker and flood more packets so as to exhaust
   the network communication bandwidth and node energy. Simulation results
   show that puppet attack is a serious and packet deliver rate goes down
   to 20\% - 10\%.}},

Abstract = {{Given a spatial raster framework F, a set of explanatory feature maps,
   training and test samples with class labels on F, as well as a base
   classifier type, the problem of ensemble learning in raster
   classification aims to learn a collection of base classifiers to
   minimize classification errors. The problem has important societal
   applications such as land cover classification but is challenging due to
   existence of class ambiguity from spatial heterogeneity, i.e., samples
   with the same feature values may have distinct class labels in different
   areas. Many existing approaches are non-spatial ensembles (e.g.,
   bagging, boosting, random forest), which assume that learning samples
   follow an identical distribution. Some spatial ensemble approaches also
   exist, which simply partition the raster framework into several regular
   sub-blocks and combine classification results on each sub-block.
   However, these existing approaches can not address the class ambiguity
   issue among pixels. In contrast, this paper proposes a new spatial
   ensemble approach, which partitions the spatial framework into several
   spatial footprints to minimize class ambiguity of training samples and
   then learns a base classifier for each footprint. Experimental
   evaluations on a real world remote sensing dataset show that the
   proposed spatial ensemble approach outperforms existing approaches when
   strong class ambiguity exists.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a commutation technique to overcome the effects of
   transformer leakage inductance in a single stage high frequency ac-link
   transformer isolated inverter. The presence of leakage inductance causes
   large voltage spikes across the transformer due to the switched nature
   of link current that is encountered in direct high frequency ac link to
   low frequency ac conversion. This paper proposes a partial resonant
   technique where a capacitor is connected across the link only during the
   instants when the current in the link needs to change its polarity. This
   results in a resonant current transition which eliminates the problem of
   abrupt current transition through an inductor. The proposed technique
   results in the recovery of the leakage energy to a large extent and also
   results in soft switching during majority of the switching transitions
   resulting in enhanced efficiency. The proposed scheme is implemented in
   the SIMULINK software environment and results are presented.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an asymmetrical converter topology with medium
   frequency transformer (MFT) isolation to interface a low voltage DC
   source with a 3-phase medium voltage grid. The topology consists of
   asymmetrical converters connected in parallel across the DC input,
   followed by a MFT for isolation and a diode bridge fed current source
   inverter (CSI) connected to the MFT secondary. The asymmetrical
   converters connected in parallel share the high input currents and are
   modulated so as to generate a multi-level stepped waveform across the
   transformer secondary. The asymmetry is introduced in the MFT turns
   ratio. The power flow in DC sources like PV being unidirectional, the
   transformer secondary side is connected to diode bridge and pulse-width
   modulated (PWM) CSI which interfaces a medium voltage grid. The stepped
   voltage across the transformer secondary and the use of diode bridge
   results in a trapezoidal current through the transformer windings
   eliminating the problem of leakage commutation. The paper also
   determines analytically the transformer voltages based on the DC link
   current requirement of the CSI based on the grid active power. The
   proposed topology is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink.}},

Abstract = {{The art gallery problem is a classical sensor placement problem that
   asks for the minimum number of guards required to see every point in an
   environment. The standard formulation does not take into account
   self-occlusions caused by a person or an object within the environment.
   Obtaining good views of an object from all orientations is important for
   surveillance and visual tracking applications. We study the art gallery
   problem under a constraint, termed. guarding, that ensures that all
   sides of any convex object are always visible in spite of
   self-occlusion. Our contributions in this paper are two-fold: we first
   prove that Omega(root n) guards are always necessary for Delta-guarding
   the interior of a simple polygon having n vertices. Next, we study the
   problem of Delta-guarding a set of line segments connecting points on
   the boundary of the polygon. This is motivated by applications where an
   object or person of interest can only move along certain paths in the
   polygon. We present a constant factor approximation algorithm for this
   problem - one of the few such results for art gallery problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present C-KLAM, a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)

   computationally-efficient technique for incorporating most of this
   information in a consistent manner, resulting in improved estimation
   accuracy. To achieve this, C-KLAM projects both proprioceptive and
   exteroceptive information from the non-keyframes to the keyframes, using
   marginalization, while maintaining the sparse structure of the
   associated information matrix, resulting in fast and efficient
   solutions. The performance of C-KLAM has been tested in experiments,
   using visual and inertial measurements, to demonstrate that it achieves
   performance comparable to that of the computationally-intensive batch
   MAP-based 3D SLAM, that uses all available measurement information.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new covariance based feature descriptor to

   equipped with an RGB-D camera. Although many recent descriptors provide
   adequate results, there is not yet a clear consensus on how to best
   tackle ``colored{''} point clouds. We present the notion of a covariance
   on RGB-D data. Covariances have not only been proven to be successful in
   image processing, but in other domains as well. Their main advantage is
   that they provide a compact and flexible description of point clouds.
   Our work is a first step towards demonstrating the usability of the
   concept of covariances in conjunction with RGB-D data. Experiments
   performed on an RGB-D database and compared to previous results show the
   increased performance of our method.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the problem of quickly building the 3D model of
   an outdoor environment from measurements obtained by a robot equipped
   with a solar panel. The robot knows the angle of the sun and the
   locations of the objects in the environment. It does not know, however,
   the height of the objects. For example, it might be possible to use
   satellite images to obtain locations of trees in a field but not their
   heights.
   In order to compute the height of an object, the robot must find the
   projection of the object's highest point. This is where the shadow of
   the object ends. The robot can find it by tracing the shadow (moving
   parallel to the sun) until the measurement switches from shadow to sun
   or vice versa. The robot's goal is to compute the height of every object
   as quickly as possible using only solar measurements.
   We formulate this as an online optimization problem. The optimal offline
   algorithm is given by the Traveling Salesman path of the transition
   points. The robot does not know these locations a priori. It must search
   for each of them. We present an algorithm with the property that for n
   objects, our distance traveled is guaranteed to be within a factor O(log
   n) of this optimal offline tour. In addition to analytical proofs, we
   demonstrate the algorithm with simulations using solar data collected
   from field experiments, and examine its performance for uniformly
   distributed sites.}},

Abstract = {{Compared with a hash table, a Bloom Filter (BF) is more space-efficient
   for supporting fast matching though resulting in a controllable and
   acceptable false positive probability. The space size of the basic BF is
   predetermined based on the expected number of elements to be stored.
   However, we cannot predict the scale of a BF space for dynamic sets. The
   two existing solutions for supporting dynamic sets, Scalable BF (SBF)
   and Dynamic BF (DBF), still face some challenges on system performance
   and memory overhead.
   This paper presents a new BF for dynamic data sets, called Partitioned
   BF (Par-BF). Compared with DBF and SBF, the size and the range of the
   false positive probability can be calculated by a group of formulas to
   leverage a sweet spot between high-performance and low-overhead.
   Moreover, Par-BF supports parallel fast matching which can improve the
   overall throughput. From our trace-driven experimental results, the IOPS
   of Par-BF outperforms that of DBF and SBF from 6X to 10X, and from 2X to
   4X, respectively. Meanwhile, through our proposed garbage collection
   policy, the memory overhead of Par-BF is less than half of the memory
   usage of SBF.}},

Abstract = {{The Vandermonde transform was recently presented as a time-frequency
   transform which, in difference to the discrete Fourier transform, also
   decorrelates the signal. Although the approximate or asymptotic
   decorrelation provided by Fourier is sufficient in many cases, its
   performance is inadequate in applications which employ short windows.
   The Vandermonde transform will therefore be useful in speech and audio
   processing applications, which have to use short analysis windows
   because the input signal varies rapidly over time. Such applications are
   often used on mobile devices with limited computational capacity,
   whereby efficient computations are of paramount importance.
   Implementation of the Vandermonde transform has, however, turned out to
   be a considerable effort: it requires advanced numerical tools whose
   performance is optimized for complexity and accuracy. This contribution
   provides a baseline solution to this task including a performance
   evaluation.}},

Abstract = {{The oracle-an arbiter of correctness of the system under test (SUT) -is
   a major component of the testing process. Specifying oracles is
   challenging for real-time embedded systems, where small changes in time
   or sensor inputs may cause large differences in behavior. Behavioral
   models of such systems, often built for analysis and simulation, are
   appealing for reuse as oracles. However, these models typically provide
   an idealized view of the system. Even when given the same inputs, the
   model's behavior can frequently be at variance with an acceptable
   behavior of the SUT executing on a real platform. We therefore propose
   steering the model when used as an oracle, to admit an expanded set of
   behaviors when judging the SUT's adherence to its requirements. On
   detecting a behavioral difference, the model is backtracked and then
   searched for a new state that satisfies certain constraints and
   minimizes a dissimilarity metric. The goal is to allow
   non-deterministic, but bounded, behavior differences while preventing
   future mismatches, by guiding the oracle-within limits-to match the
   execution of the SUT. Early results show that steering significantly
   increases SUT-oracle conformance with minimal masking of real faults
   and, thus, has significant potential for reducing development costs.}},

Abstract = {{Annotations are important for the description of any object. They give
   understanding about the object in a summary form. Annotations, unlike
   tags, are structured form of meta-data information. Best structured
   information is prepared by humans. However, given the large volume and
   variety of objects like images, videos and documents, to name a few, it
   is practically impossible to annotate all the objects in the world. In
   such a situation, automated approaches to subscribe semantically correct
   and structured annotations is an extremely important task. In this paper
   we have proposed a novel problem of semantic annotation of research
   datasets. Explosion in the usage of social media and various electronic
   devices has led to collection of huge volumes of datasets for scientific
   research. Although, most of the datasets are available online, the lack
   of semantic annotations/meta-data and the lack of a unified public
   repository has made it difficult for researchers to browse through the
   datasets even with popular search engines. In this work we propose an
   algorithmic approach to automate the task of annotating the datasets in
   structured and semantic manner. We have used knowledge from the World
   Wide Web and organized knowledge bases such as dbpedia, yago, freebase
   and wordnet to derive context and annotations for the research datasets.
   The proposed approach is evaluated on two real world datasets, namely,
   UCI dataset repository and SNAP dataset collections. Using various
   experimental setups we show that the proposed approach outperforms the
   baseline approaches. We also perform a case study to compare our results
   with Google search engine. We find that using the semantic annotations
   the search accuracy increases by 18\% over the normal search for
   datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud providers offer an array of storage services that, represent,
   different points along the performance, cost, and durability spectrum.
   if all application desires the, composite benefits of multiple storage
   tiers, then it must manage the complexity of different interfaces to
   these storage services and their diverse policies. We believe that, it,
   is possible to provide the benefits of customized tiered cloud storage
   to applications without compromising simplicity using a lightweight
   middleware. Tit tiffs paper, We introduce Tiera a middleware that
   enables the provision of multi tiered cloud storage instances that are
   easy to specify, flexible, and enable a rich array of storage policies
   and desired metrics to be, realized. Tiera's novelty lies in the
   first-class support for encapsulated tiered cloud storage, ease, of
   programmability of data management policies, and support, for runtime
   replacement and addition of policies and tiers. Tiera enables an
   application to realize a desired :metric (e.g., low latency or low cost)
   by selecting different storage services that constitute Tiera instance,
   and easily specifying a policy, using event and response pairs, to
   manage the life cycle of data stored in the instance. We illustrate the
   benefits of Tiera through;A prototype implemented on the Amazon cloud.
   By deploying unmodified MySQL database engine and;A TPC-W WEAL bookstore
   application Tiera, we are able to improve their respective throughputs
   by 47\%-125\% and 46\%-69\%, over standard deployments. We further show
   the flexibility of Tiera in achieving different, desired application
   metrics with minimal overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Effervescent atomization is a process in which a bulk liquid is
   transformed into a spray of droplets by injecting a small amount of gas
   into the liquid before it is ejected from the atomizer. Advantages of
   using effervescent atomization method include larger exit orifices to
   reduce clogging issues, reduced injection pressures, and lower gas to
   liquid mass flow ratios (GLR) as compared to pressure or air-blast
   atomizers {[}1]. Effervescent atomization has been used in a number of
   applications including agricultural sprays, paint sprays, combustion for
   lowering pollutant emissions, spray cooling for gas turbine and medical
   applications, waste incineration, and process industry applications. In
   the present work, the near nozzle exit characteristics of an air-water
   effervescent atomizer at gas to liquid mass flow ratio such as 0.25\%
   are investigated numerically through two-fluid Eulerian-Eulerian
   ensemble averaged modeling. The two-fluid model is solved through the
   finite volume method. Numerical simulations are performed using the
   commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code ANSYS FLUENT. The
   effects of effective (average) air bubble diameter size inside the
   atomizer, exit nozzle diameter, and injection pressures on the average
   liquid water jet width are presented. An optimal bubble size is observed
   for increasing the average liquid jet width which leads to enhanced jet
   break-up at downstream of the nozzle. The water volume fraction profiles
   within the sprays are also reported. The numerical results are compared
   with experimental visualizations and jet width measurements to further
   the understanding of the spray characteristics of effervescent
   atomization for atomizer design.}},

Abstract = {{By keeping a size-L list of intermediate candidates at each decoding
   step, list successive cancellation (SC) polar decoder successfully
   achieves better performance compared to the conventional SC polar
   decoder. However, the size-L list SC decoder will result in linear
   increase of hardware complexity, which hinders the efficient
   implementation and therefore the wide application of it. To this end, an
   efficient adaptive list SC decoder for polar codes is proposed in this
   paper. Simulation results have demonstrated that for (1024, 512)
   rate-1/2 polar code, the proposed adaptive size-2 and size-4 list
   decoders can achieve 37.6\% and 17.0\% computational complexity
   reduction at point SNR = 2.0 dB compared to the conventional ones,
   respectively. Hardware architecture for the proposed adaptive list

Abstract = {{Successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithm is a powerful
   method that can help polar codes achieve excellent error-correcting
   performance. However, the current SCL algorithm and decoders are based
   on likelihood or log-likelihood forms, which render high hardware
   complexity. In this paper, we propose a log-likelihood-ratio (LLR)-based
   SCL (LLR-SCL) decoding algorithm, which only needs half the computation
   and storage complexity than the conventional one. Then, based on the
   proposed algorithm, we develop low-complexity VLSI architectures for
   LLR-SCL decoders. Analysis results show that the proposed LLR-SCL
   decoder achieves 50\% reduction in hardware and 98\% improvement in
   hardware efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Low-rank tensor decomposition has many applications in signal processing
   and machine learning, and is becoming increasingly important for
   analyzing big data. A significant challenge is the computation of
   intermediate products which can be much larger than the final result of
   the computation, or even the original tensor. We propose a scheme that
   allows memory-efficient in-place updates of intermediate matrices.
   Motivated by recent advances in big tensor decomposition from multiple
   compressed replicas, we also consider the related problem of
   memory-efficient tensor compression. The resulting algorithms can be
   parallelized, and can exploit but do not require sparsity.}},

Abstract = {{An N-point FFT processes N complex signals to compute N output complex
   signals using decimation-in-time (DIT) or decimation-in-frequency (DIF)
   approach. The FFT makes use of n = log(2)N stages of computations where
   each stage computes N complex signals; N is assumed to be power-of-two.
   This paper considers implementation of a real signal of length N. Since
   the degrees of freedom of the input data is N, each stage of the FFT
   should not need to compute more than N signal values, where a signal
   value can corresponds to a purely real or purely imaginary value. Any
   more than N samples computed at any FFT stage is inherently redundant.
   This paper, for the first time, presents novel DIT and DIF structures
   for computing real FFT, referred as RFFT, that are canonic with respect
   to the number signal values computed at each FFT stage. In the proposed
   structure, in an N-point RFFT, exactly N signal values are computed at
   the output of each FFT stage and at the output. No prior canonic DIT
   RFFT structure was presented before. This paper, for the first time,
   presents a formal approach to compute RFFT using DIT in a canonic
   manner. While canonic FFT structures based on decimation-in-frequency
   were presented before, these structures were derived in an adhoc way.
   This paper presents a formal method to derive canonic DIF RFFT
   structures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new methodology to synthesize molecular reactions
   for discrete-time signal processing (DSP) computations that produce
   time-varying quantities of molecules as a function of time-varying input
   quantities. DSP structures include delay elements which need to be
   synchronized by a clock signal. This paper demonstrates an approach to
   synthesize molecular reactions to implement DSP operations without
   requiring a clock signal. In the proposed approach, each delay and
   output variables are mapped to two types of molecules. The scheduling of
   the reactions is controlled by absence indicators, i.e., signals
   transfer according to the absence of other signals. All computations are
   scheduled in four phases. The input signal and values stored in all
   delay elements are consumed for computations in the first phase. Results
   of computations are stored in the first types of molecule corresponding
   to the delay elements and output variables. During the second phase, the
   value of the first molecular type is transferred to the second molecular
   type for the output variable. In the third phase, the values of first
   types of molecule are transferred to the second types of molecule
   associated with each delay element. The output molecules are collected
   in the fourth phase. The method is illustrated by synthesizing a simple
   FIR filter, an IIR filter, and an 8-point real-valued fast Fourier
   transform (FFT). The synthesized systems consist of bimolecular
   reactions and are translated to DNA-strand displacement reactions. The
   methodology is validated through mass-action simulations of DNA
   kinetics. The proposed approach may play a potential role in
   applications such as drug delivery and in monitoring spectral content of
   proteins.}},

Abstract = {{Polar code are the first provable capacity-achieving forward error
   correction (FEC) codes. In general polar codes can be decoded via either
   successive cancellation (SC) or belief propagation (BP) decoding
   algorithm. However, to date practical applications of polar codes have
   been hindered by the long decoding latency and limited error-correcting
   performance problems. In this papers, based on our recent proposed early
   stopping criteria for the BP algorithm, we propose a hybrid BP-SC
   decoding scheme to improve the decoding performance of polar codes with
   relatively short latency. Simulation results show that, for (1024, 512)
   polar codes the proposed approach leads to at least 0.2dB gain over the
   BP algorithm with the same maximum number of iterations for the entire
   SNR region, and also achieves 0.2dB decoding gain over the BP algorithm
   with the same worst-case latency in the high SNR region. Besides
   compared to the SC algorithm, the proposed scheme leads to 0.2dB gain in
   the medium SNR region with much less average decoding latency. In
   addition, we also propose the low-complexity unified hardware
   architecture for the hyhrid decoding scheme, which is able to implement
   SC and BP algorithms using same hardware.}},

   voltages. A single multi-winding high frequency transformer (HFT)
   interfaces different wind generators/photovoltaic arrays using many
   H-bridge converters and PWM inverters. The leakage inductance of the
   transformer acts as the smoothening filter for the current through the
   HFT. With sinusoidal voltages and smooth currents through the
   transformer, there is significant reduction in transformer losses and
   also natural commutation of leakage energy is obtained. The operating
   principle, modulation and control of the proposed PET is validated by
   simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a single stage, bi-directional multi-level converter
   topology with a multi-winding medium frequency transformer (MFT)
   isolation to interface a low voltage DC with a 3-phase high voltage
   grid. The proposed topology can be used for integrating 3-ph utility
   grid with various low voltage renewables like solar photovoltaic, fuel
   cells etc. The transformer secondary windings in each phase have unequal
   turns ratio. This asymmetry introduced in the transformer turns ratio
   allows to generate more output voltage levels, using less number of
   semiconductor switches leading to a reduced footprint. The transformer
   secondary side has AC-AC converter modules which are pulse width
   modulated. This results in the elimination of the harmonics at multiples
   of grid frequency, resulting in reduced size of filter inductance. The
   paper also shows the winding procedure to interleave the windings
   resulting in lower leakage inductance to minimize the problem of leakage
   commutation. The proposed topology is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink.}},

Abstract = {{For most practical nonlinear state estimation problems, the conventional
   nonlinear filters do not usually work well for some cases, such as
   inaccurate system model, sudden change of state-interested and unknown
   variance of measurement noise. In this paper, an adaptive cubature
   strong tracking information filter using variational Bayesian (VB)
   method is proposed to cope with these complex cases. Firstly, the strong
   tracking filtering (STF) technology is used to integrally improve
   performance of cubature information filter (CIF) aiming at the first two
   cases and an iterative scheme is presented to effectively evaluate a
   strong tracking fading factor. Secondly, the VB method is introduced to
   iteratively evaluate the unknown variance of measurement noise. Finally,
   the novel adaptive cubature information filter is obtained by perfectly
   combining the STF technology with the VB method, where the variance
   estimation provided by the VB method guarantees normal running of the
   strong tracking functionality.}},

   applying predictive data-analytic methods to survival data is in the

   binary classification setting, we propose a strategy for encoding
   censored data, leading to the SVM+/LUPI formulations. Further, we
   present empirical comparison of the new method and the classical Cox

Abstract = {{Neutron detectors are deployed at ports of entry across the world to
   monitor people and cargos for smuggled nuclear materials and are often
   incorporated in nuclear power plant designed to monitor power levels and
   ensure safe operations. With the supply of Helium-3 rapidly decreasing
   and due to increase of terrorism threats it is vital to US. national
   security that a viable alternative material be identified, and a new
   neutron detector design made available, especially for portal monitoring
   applications. The interest to study Boron-10 as an alternative to
   helium-3, due to the vast natural supply that the United States
   possesses and its nontoxic characteristics, is increasing in different
   research arenas. Our work consists on taking advantage of the near 20\%
   of boron-10 present in naturally occurring boron which (just as
   phosphorus) is used to dope semiconductors. Boron doped semiconductor
   wafers were characterized using four-point probe techniques. Resistors
   and transistors made with various levels of boron concentration were
   exposed to a thermal flux at various fluencies at Los Alamos National
   Laboratory. The reaction, B-10+n -> L-i+alpha, caused by neutron
   irradiation, introduces impurities in the silicon lattice thus producing
   measurable differences in electronic parameters. These changes are
   likely to be proportional to the fluence of the source, and hence to the
   neutron flux. The results show that for irradiated resistors possessing
   very high values of boron concentration there is a significant reduction
   in resistivity. This trend is not seen for medium or low values of
   boron. Additionally, there was no observation of significant changes in
   other electronic parameters such as threshold voltage or
   trans-conductance, for the transistors exposed and tested.}},

Abstract = {{Latest microarchitectures provide support for both hardware and software
   prefetching. However, the architectural features supporting either are
   different. In addition, these features can vary from one architecture to
   another. As a result, the choice of the right prefetching strategy is
   non-trivial for both the programmers and compiler-writers.
   In this paper, we study prefetching techniques in the context of
   different architectural features that support prefetching on existing
   hardware platforms. These features include, the size of the line fill
   buffer or the Miss Status Handling Registers servicing prefetch requests
   at each level of cache, the effectiveness of the hardware prefetchers
   and their interaction with software prefetching, the nature of the
   instruction pipeline (in-order/out-of-order execution), etc. Our
   experiments with two widely different processors, a latest multi-core
   (SandyBridge) and a many-core (Xeon Phi), show that these architectural
   features have a significant bearing on the prefetching choice in a given
   source program, so much so that the best prefetching technique on
   SandyBridge performs worst on Xeon Phi and vice-versa. Based on our
   study of the interaction between the host architecture and prefetching,
   we find that coordinated multi-stage prefetching that brings data closer
   to the core in stages, yields best performance. On SandyBridge, the
   mid-level cache hardware prefetcher and L1 software prefetching
   coordinate to achieve this end, whereas on Xeon Phi, pure software
   prefetching proves adequate.}},

Abstract = {{Isolating a particular strand of DNA from a double stranded DNA duplex
   is an important step in aptamer generation as well as many other
   biotechnology applications. Here we describe a microfluidic,
   flow-through, dialysis device for isolating single-stranded DNA (ssDNA)
   from double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). The device consists of two channels
   fabricated in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) separated by a track etched
   polycarbonate membrane (800 nm pore size). To isolate ssDNA, dual-biotin
   labelled dsDNA was immobilized onto streptavidin-coated polystyrene
   beads. Alkaline treatment was used to denature dsDNA, releasing the
   non-biotinylated ssDNA. In the flow-through dialysis device the
   liberated ssDNA was able to cross the membrane and was collected in an
   outlet channel. The complementary sequence bound to the bead was unable
   to cross the membrane and was directed to a waste channel. The effect of
   NaOH concentration and flow rate on purity and yield were compared.
   >95\% ssDNA purity was achieved at 25 mM NaOH. However, lower flow rates
   were necessary to achieve ssDNA yields approaching the 50\% theoretical
   maximum of the concurrent-flow device. Under optimized conditions the
   microfluidic isolation achieved even higher purity ssDNA than analogous
   manual procedures.}},

Abstract = {{Highly efficient immobilization of multi-enzyme systems involving
   cofactor regeneration represents one of the greatest challenges in
   bioprocessing. Particulate artificial cells with enzymes and cofactors
   encapsulated within microcapsules have long been the major type of
   multi-enzyme biocatalysts. In the present work, a novel hollow
   nanofiber-based artificial cell that performs multi-step reactions
   involving efficient coenzyme regeneration was fabricated in situ by a
   facile co-axial electrospinning process. To that end, a mixture of
   glycerol and water containing the dissolved multi-enzyme system for the
   bile acid assay, which included 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3
   alpha-HSD), diaphorase (DP) and NADH was fed as the core phase solution,
   and a N, N-dimethylacetylamide solution of 30 wt\% polyurethane was fed
   as the shell phase solution during the co-axial electrospinning. The
   relationship between the structures of the hollow nanofibers and the
   activity and stability of the encapsulated enzymes was studied. At core
   and shell phase electrospinning solution flow rates of 0.07 and 0.5 mL
   h(-1), activity recoveries as high as 76\% and 82\% were obtained for
   the encapsulated 3a-HSD and DP. The hollow nanofiber-based artificial
   cells were successfully used for the bile acid assay, yielding good
   linearity for bile acid concentrations ranging from 0-200 mu M. Compared
   with the solution-based multi-enzyme system, the hollow nanofiber-based
   multi-enzyme system presented a lumped activity recovery of 75\%. In
   addition, the hollow nanofiber provided the multi-enzyme system confined
   inside the nano-domain of the hollow fibers with a unique stabilizing
   mechanism, such that more than a 170-fold increase in half-life at 25
   degrees C was obtained for the encapsulated 3a-HSD and DP. This study is
   expected to greatly promote and broaden the application of multi-enzyme
   systems in industry, biosensor, biomedical, and many other related
   research fields.}},

Abstract = {{Heparan sulfate proteoglycans act as co-receptors for many chemokines
   and growth factors. The sulfation pattern of the heparan sulfate chains
   is a critical regulatory step affecting the binding of chemokines and
   growth factors. N-deacetylase-N-sulfotransferase1 (Ndst1) is one of the
   first enzymes to catalyze sulfation. Previously published work has shown
   that HSPGs alter tangent moduli and stiffness of tissues and cells. We
   hypothesized that loss of Ndst1 in smooth muscle would lead to
   significant changes in heparan sulfate modification and the elastic
   properties of arteries. In line with this hypothesis, the axial tangent
   modulus was significantly decreased in aorta from mice lacking Ndst1 in
   smooth muscle (SM22 alpha cre(+)Ndst1(-/-), p < 0.05, n = 5). The
   decrease in axial tangent modulus was associated with a significant
   switch in myosin and actin types and isoforms expressed in aorta and
   isolated aortic vascular smooth muscle cells. In contrast, no changes
   were found in the compliance of smaller thoracodorsal arteries of SM22
   alpha cre(+)Ndst1(-/-) mice. In summary, the major findings of this
   study were that targeted ablation of Ndst1 in smooth muscle cells
   results in altered biomechanical properties of aorta and differential
   expression of myosin and actin types and isoforms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel method of capturing more energy from the
   wind using short-term energy storage in a hydrostatic wind turbine. A
   hydrostatic transmission (HST) not only provides reliable operation but
   also enables energy management features like energy regeneration using
   hydraulic accumulators. In this study, turbulence-induced wind
   transients occurring near the rated power are exploited to extract more
   energy from the wind. Wind characteristics are analyzed to develop
   models to quantify the energy losses due to the wind turbulence and the
   potential energy gains from the short-term energy storage. A dynamic
   simulation model of the hydrostatic wind turbine and the proposed energy
   storage system is developed. A rule-based control strategy for the
   energy storage is proposed. Results show that in a 50 kW hydrostatic
   wind turbine, the annual energy production (AEP) can be increased by
   4.1\% with a 60 liter hydraulic accumulator.}},

Volume = {{14}},

Pages = {{55-61}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a skin-like tactile sensor array to measure
   the contact pressure of curved surfaces. The sensor array is laminated
   into a thin film 3 mm in thickness and can easily be wrapped around a
   pencil without damaging its skin-like structure. So far, we have
   achieved the array containing 8 x 16 sensor elements. Its spatial
   resolution is 1 element per 9 mm(2) area and it can measure the pressure
   up to 360 kPa. The sensor-array patch contains three layers. The upper
   and lower layers are polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin films embedded
   with the conductor strips formed by PDMS-based silver nanowires (AgNWs)
   networks. The middle layer is formed by the mixing of nickel powder with
   liquid PDMS for contact force measurement. Experimental tests have
   demonstrated that conductor strips on the upper layer can maintain their
   resistances similar to 23 Omega with <4 Omega increase when the tensile
   strain is up to 50\%. Noted is the conductor made with carbon nanotubes
   can keep its conductivity unchanged for up to only 40\% tensile strain.
   Through fatigue tests, it is observed that the measured AgNWs/PDMS
   conductor strip exhibits low and stable resistances. This is one of the
   most desired behaviors of the stretchable interconnects for signal
   transmission. The integrated sensor system can successfully measure the
   contact pressure induced by objects of different shapes. It can be
   applied on curved or non-planar surfaces in robots or medical devices
   for force detection and feedback.}},

Title = {{Pressure drop hysteresis effect on biodiesel filtration}},
Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{115}},
Pages = {{629-635}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Filter plugging is one of the main cold flow problems associated with
   the use of biodiesel blends in cold climates. We developed a new fuel
   screening test to analyze the cold flow properties of the biodiesel and
   its blends with ULSD based on pressure drop measurements across a test
   filter. The fuel is pumped through a test filter under controlled
   temperature and flow conditions and the pressure drop is measured. As
   temperature is reduced at a constant flow rate, the pressure drop
   increases and the rate of the pressure drop increase goes up sharply as
   a plugging condition is approached. Biodiesel blends in general exhibit
   higher pressure drops than ULSD and the pressure drop increases with the
   biodiesel fraction. When fuels are cooled to -30 degrees C and then
   reheated, the pressure drop at each temperature is higher than that
   measured when the fuels are being cooled. The difference between the
   cooling and heating curves decreases as the fuel isheated but is still
   present at 20 degrees C. Both ULSD and biodiesel blends exhibit this
   hysteresis effect, but the effect is much larger with biodiesel blends.
   This means that exposure of biodiesel blends to low temperatures
   predisposes them to filter plugging even if they are dispensed and used
   at higher temperatures. In addition, the pressure drop hysteresis will
   remain unless fuel properties return to their original state when
   reheated to 40 degrees C or higher. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this report, we demonstrate a printed, flexible, and low-voltage
   circuit that successfully drives a polymer electrochromic (EC) pixel as
   large as 4 mm(2) that is printed on the same substrate. All of the key
   components of the drive circuitry, namely, resistors, capacitors, and
   transistors, were aerosol-jet-printed onto a plastic foil; metallic
   electrodes and interconnects were the only components prepatterned on
   the plastic by conventional photolithography. The large milliampere
   drive currents necessary to switch a 4 mm(2) EC pixel were controlled by
   printed electrolyte-gated transistors (EGTs) that incorporate printable
   ion gels for the gate insulator layers and poly(3-hexylthiophene) for
   the semiconductor channels. Upon application of a 1 V input pulse, the
   circuit switches the printed EC pixel ON (red) and OFF (blue) two times
   in approximately 4 s. The performance of the circuit and the behavior of
   the individual resistors, capacitors, EGTs, and the EC pixel are
   analyzed as functions of the printing parameters and operating

Abstract = {{The fibrillar structure of aqueous methylcellulose (MC) gels was probed
   using a combination of small-angle neutron scattering (SANS),
   ultra-small-angle neutron scattering (USANS), and cryogenic transmission
   electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). The effect of molecular weight (M-w) and
   concentration on the gel structure was explored. The fibrillar
   morphology was consistently observed at elevated temperatures (>= 70
   degrees C), independent of concentration and M-w Moreover, the fibril
   dimensions extracted from SANS by fitting to a scattering function for
   semiflexible cylinders with disperse radii revealed that the fibril
   diameter of ca. 14 +/- 1 nm is constant for a mass fraction range of
   0.01\%-3.79\% and for all M-w investigated (49-530 kg/mol). Comparison
   of the measured SANS curves with predicted scattering traces revealed
   that at 70 degrees C the fibrils contain an average volume fraction of
   40\% polymer. Taking linear combinations of low temperature (solution
   state) and high temperature (gel state) SANS traces, the progression of
   fibril growth with temperature for aqueous MC materials was determined.
   At low temperatures (<= 30 degrees C) no fibrils are present, whereas in
   the vicinity of 40-50 degrees C a small fraction begins to form. For
   temperatures >= 70 degrees C, virtually all of the chains are
   incorporated into the fibrillar structure. The persistence of the fibril
   structure during cooling was probed by SANS and cryo-TEM. The
   well-established rheological hysteresis upon cooling is directly
   correlated to the persistence of the fibril structures. Furthermore,
   cryo-TEM images taken upon heating to 50 degrees C showed no fibrils,
   whereas images for samples that were first heated to 70 degrees C and
   then cooled to 50 degrees C clearly display the fibrillar structure.
   USANS measurements revealed that heterogeneities in the gels persist
   beyond the largest length scale accessed in scattering experiments
   (similar to 20 mu m), consistent with the observed optical turbidity.}},

Abstract = {{Using high-speed confocal microscopy, we measure the particle positions
   in a colloidal suspension under large-amplitude oscillatory shear. Using
   the particle positions, we quantify the in situ anisotropy of the
   pair-correlation function, a measure of the Brownian stress. From these
   data we find two distinct types of responses as the system crosses over
   from equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium states. The first is a
   nonlinear amplitude saturation that arises from shear-induced advection,
   while the second is a linear frequency saturation due to competition
   between suspension relaxation and shear rate. In spite of their
   different underlying mechanisms, we show that all the data can be scaled
   onto a master curve that spans the equilibrium and far-from-equilibrium
   regimes, linking small-amplitude oscillatory to continuous shear. This
   observation illustrates a colloidal analog of the Cox-Merz rule and its
   microscopic underpinning. Brownian dynamics simulations show that
   interparticle interactions are sufficient for generating both
   experimentally observed saturations.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{103}},
Number = {{25}},
Month = {{DEC 16}},
Abstract = {{The spin dynamics at the interface between the CoFeB and Ta layer has
   been studied using spin pumping and spin wave characterizations. The
   spin pumping driven by the ferromagnetic resonance in the CoFeB layer
   injects a spin current into Ta layer which results in an electromotive
   force across the Ta layer due to the inverse spin Hall effect. Upon
   changing the polarity of the bias magnetic field, the polarity of the
   output voltage inverts and the output voltage increases linearly in
   respect to the microwave signal power which are consistent with the spin
   pumping characteristics. The effect of the in-plane magnetization angle
   on the output voltage has been studied. Furthermore, it is found that
   the frequency spectrum of the spin Hall voltage is modified by the
   annealing temperature and the full width at half maximum of the spin
   pumping increases by more than 40\% with the increase of the annealing
   temperature from 200 degrees C to 300 degrees C. The spin Hall angle at
   the Ta-CoFeB interface is determined to be 0.014, and the damping
   constant of the CoFeB increases from 0.006 in pure CoFeB to 0.015 in
   Ta/CoFeB film. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The contamination of urban lakes by anthropogenic pollutants such as
   perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a worldwide environmental problem.
   Large-scale, long-term monitoring of urban lakes requires careful
   prioritization of available resources, focusing efforts on potentially
   impaired lakes. Herein, a database of PFOS concentrations in 304 fish
   caught from 28 urban lakes was used for development of an urban-lake
   prioritization framework by means of exploratory data analysis (EDA)
   with the aid of a geographical information system. The prioritization
   scheme consists of three main tiers: preliminary classification, carried
   out by hierarchical cluster analysis; predictor screening, fulfilled by
   a regression tree method; and model development by means of a neural
   network. The predictive performance of the newly developed model was
   assessed using a training/validation splitting method and determined by
   an external validation set. The application of the model in the U.S.
   state of Minnesota identified 40 urban lakes that may contain elevated
   levels of PFOS; these lakes were not previously considered in PFOS
   monitoring programs. The model results also highlight ongoing
   industrial/commercial activities as a principal determinant of PFOS
   pollution in urban lakes, and suggest vehicular traffic as an important
   source and surface runoff as a primary pollution carrier. In addition,
   the EDA approach was further compared to a spatial interpolation method
   (kriging), and their advantages and disadvantages were discussed. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a new type of skin-like tactile
   pressure sensor array. The sensor array is scalable, flexible and
   stretchable and can measure pressure up to 250 kPa within 30\%
   stretching rate without damaging its mechanical structure. It can also
   conform to irregular three-dimensional surfaces. The sensor array
   consists of three layers. The top and bottom layers are formed by the
   array of parallel conductive strips made of silver nanowires (AgNWs)
   embedded in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) thin films. The AgNWs/PDMS
   conductor strips are used as stretchable interconnections to transmit
   electrical signals. The middle layer is made of PDMS. This film is
   pre-molded with holes filling with cylinder-shaped conductive elastomer
   for pressure measurement. In this paper, the characteristic of the
   AgNWs/PDMS conductor strips as stretchable interconnections is studied.
   The piezoresistive properties of the sensels (one sensing element is
   called a sensel) were measured and discussed. The performance of the
   tactile sensor array under stretching was also tested. With the
   associated scanning power-supply circuit and data acquisition system, it
   is demonstrated that the system can successfully capture the tactile
   images induced by objects of different shapes. Such sensor system could
   be applied on curved or non-planar surfaces in robots or medical devices
   for force detection and feedback. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Single-bubble sonoluminescence (SBSL) spectra from aqueous sulfuric acid
   solutions containing dissolved neon show widely varying emission despite

   emission from hydroxyl radicals is observed, with the rovibronic
   progression being well-described by a single temperature of 7600 K. From
   an 80 wt \% solution, however, emission spectra reveal vibrationally hot
   sulfur monoxide (SO; T-v = 2400 K) that is also rotationally cold (T-r =
   280 K). Further, the SO vibrational population distribution is
   best-described by a non-Boltzmann distribution. Excited neon atom
   emission observed from the 80 wt \% solution gives an estimated
   temperature of only 3400 K, indicative of emission from a cool outer
   shell at the interfacial region. The neon atom excited-state population
   is also best-described by a non-Boltzmann distribution. These
   observations are consistent with SBSL emission having both a spatial and

Abstract = {{Ionic liquids feature a combination of properties that make them very
   interesting solvents for polymers, but many questions remain regarding
   the thermodynamics of polymer/ionic liquid solutions. In this work, the
   lower-critical-solution-temperature (LCST) phase behavior of
   poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PnBMA) in mixtures of the ionic liquids
   1-butyl-3-m ethylimidazolium:bis (trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide

   ({[}EMIm]{[}TFSI]) is characterized by transmittance, light scattering,
   and small-angle neutron scattering measurements. Several relevant
   thermodynamic parameters are easily tuned by varying the ionic liquid
   composition. In particular, the cloud point, spinodal, and Theta
   temperatures are all found to increase linearly with {[}BMIm] content.
   The interaction parameters, chi, are determined as a function of
   temperature and concentration using three different methods, and the
   results from each method are compared. The entropic and enthalpic
   components of the interaction parameter, chi, are also found to vary
   linearly with {[}BMIm] content in the ionic liquid, increasing and
   decreasing, respectively. The increase in the enthalpic driving force
   for mixing with increasing {[}BMIm] content dominates over the decrease
   in the entropic penalty for mixing, leading to improved solubility. This
   result is discussed in terms of molecular interactions and oriented
   solvation. This work characterizes the solution thermodynamics of one
   representative system in a very interesting class of polymer solutions,
   and provides insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying its LCST
   phase behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Partially ordered Fe-N thin films were grown by a facing target
   sputtering process on the surface of a (001) Ag underlayer on MgO
   substrates. It was confirmed by x-ray diffraction that the Ag layer
   enlarged the in-plane lattice of the Fe-N thin films. Domains of the
   ordered alpha''-Fe16N2 phase within an epitaxial (001) alpha'-FexN phase
   were identified by electron diffraction and high-resolution
   aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)
   methods. STEM dark-field and bright-field images showed the fully
   ordered structure of the alpha''-Fe16N2 at the atomic column level. High
   saturation magnetization(Ms) of 1890 emu/cc was obtained for
   alpha''-Fe16N2 on the Ag underlayer, while only 1500 emu/cc was measured
   for Fe-N on the Fe underlayer. The results are likely due to a tensile
   strain induced in the alpha''-Fe16N2 phase by the Ag structure at the
   interface. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Land use regression (LUR) models typically investigate within-urban
   variability in air pollution. Recent improvements in data quality and

   EuroAirnet monitoring sites covering background, industrial, and traffic
   environments. Predictor variables include land use characteristics,
   population density, and length of major and minor roads in zones from
   0.1 km to 10 km, altitude, and distance to sea. We explore models with
   and without satellite-based NO2 and PM2.5 as predictor variables, and we
   compare two available land cover data sets (global; European). Model
   performance (adjusted R-2) is 0.48-0.58 for NO2 and 0.22-0.50 for PM10.
   Inclusion of satellite data improved model performance (adjusted R-2)
   by, on average, 0.05 for NO2 and 0.11 for PM10. Models were applied on a
   100 m grid across Western Europe; to support future research, these data

Title = {{TAL Effector Specificity for base 0 of the DNA Target Is Altered in a
   Complex, Effector- and Assay-Dependent Manner by Substitutions for the
   Tryptophan in Cryptic Repeat-1}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{TAL effectors are re-targetable transcription factors used for tailored
   gene regulation and, as TAL effector-nuclease fusions (TALENs), for
   genome engineering. Their hallmark feature is a customizable central
   string of polymorphic amino acid repeats that interact one-to-one with
   individual DNA bases to specify the target. Sequences targeted by TAL
   effector repeats in nature are nearly all directly preceded by a thymine
   (T) that is required for maximal activity, and target sites for custom
   TAL effector constructs have typically been selected with this
   constraint. Multiple crystal structures suggest that this requirement
   for T at base 0 is encoded by a tryptophan residue (W232) in a cryptic
   repeat N-terminal to the central repeats that exhibits energetically
   favorable van der Waals contacts with the T. We generated variants based
   on TAL effector PthXo1 with all single amino acid substitutions for
   W232. In a transcriptional activation assay, many substitutions altered
   or relaxed the specificity for T and a few were as active as wild type.
   Some showed higher activity. However, when replicated in a different TAL
   effector, the effects of the substitutions differed. Further, the
   effects differed when tested in the context of a TALEN in a DNA cleavage
   assay, and in a TAL effector-DNA binding assay. Substitution of the
   N-terminal region of the PthXo1 construct with that of one of the TAL
   effector-like proteins of Ralstonia solanacearum, which have arginine in
   place of the tryptophan, resulted in specificity for guanine as the 5'
   base but low activity, and several substitutions for the arginine,
   including tryptophan, destroyed activity altogether. Thus, the effects
   on specificity and activity generated by substitutions at the W232 (or
   equivalent) position are complex and context dependent. Generating TAL
   effector scaffolds with high activity that robustly accommodate sites
   without a T at position 0 may require larger scale re-engineering.}},

Abstract = {{The structure and free energy of multistranded linear polymer ends
   evolves as individual subunits are added and lost. Thus, the energetic
   state of the polymer end is not constant, as assembly theory has
   assumed. Here we utilize a Brownian dynamics approach to simulate the
   addition and loss of individual subunits at the polymer tip. Using the
   microtubule as a primary example, we examined how the structure of the
   polymer tip dictates the rate at which units are added to and lost from
   individual protofilaments. We find that freely diffusing subunits arrive
   less frequently to lagging protofilaments but bind more efficiently,
   such that there is no kinetic difference between leading and lagging
   protofilaments within a tapered tip. However, local structure at the
   nanoscale has up to an order-of-magnitude effect on the rate of
   addition. Thus, the kinetic on-rate constant, integrated across the
   microtubule tip (k(on,MT)), is an ensemble average of the varying
   individual protofilament on-rate constants (k(on,PF)). Our findings have
   implications for both catastrophe and rescue of the dynamic microtubule
   end, and provide a subnanoscale framework for understanding the
   mechanism of action of microtubule-associated proteins and
   microtubule-directed drugs. Although we utilize the specific example of
   the microtubule here, the findings are applicable to multistranded
   polymers generally.}},

Title = {{Investigation of a New Electrode Array Technology for a Central Auditory
   Prosthesis}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{Ongoing clinical studies on patients recently implanted with the
   auditory midbrain implant (AMI) into the inferior colliculus (IC) for
   hearing restoration have shown that these patients do not achieve
   performance levels comparable to cochlear implant patients. The AMI
   consists of a single-shank array (20 electrodes) for stimulation along
   the tonotopic axis of the IC. Recent findings suggest that one major
   limitation in AMI performance is the inability to sufficiently activate
   neurons across the three-dimensional (3-D) IC. Unfortunately, there are
   no currently available 3-D array technologies that can be used for
   clinical applications. More recently, there has been a new initiative by
   the European Commission to fund and develop 3-D chronic electrode arrays
   for science and clinical applications through the NeuroProbes project
   that can overcome the bulkiness and limited 3-D configurations of
   currently available array technologies. As part of the NeuroProbes
   initiative, we investigated whether their new array technology could be
   potentially used for future AMI patients. Since the NeuroProbes
   technology had not yet been tested for electrical stimulation in an in
   vivo animal preparation, we performed experiments in
   ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs in which we inserted and stimulated a
   NeuroProbes array within the IC and recorded the corresponding neural
   activation within the auditory cortex. We used 2-D arrays for this
   initial feasibility study since they were already available and were
   sufficient to access the IC and also demonstrate effective activation of
   the central auditory system. Based on these encouraging results and the
   ability to develop customized 3-D arrays with the NeuroProbes
   technology, we can further investigate different stimulation patterns

Abstract = {{The rheological model, Huet model, which is composed of one spring and
   two power function elements, has two expressions: one in time domain,
   which is used for creep compliance, and one in the frequency domain,
   which is associated with complex modulus. Previous research efforts
   showed that the Huet model provides a very good fitting of experimental
   results obtained from creep and complex modulus tests on asphalt
   materials. However, the potential use of this model as an
   inter-conversion tool between the data obtained in the time domain and
   those in the frequency domain, and vice versa, was never previously
   evaluated. In this paper, the possibility of using the Huet model for
   predicting the complex modulus of asphalt binders and asphalt mixtures
   from the experimental data obtained from creep tests, performed with the
   bending beam rheometer at low temperatures, was investigated. The
   predictions obtained with the Huet model were experimentally verified by
   a set of complex modulus tests performed on 2 asphalt binders and 20
   asphalt mixtures with the dynamic shear rheometer. The good agreement
   between the predicted and the measured complex modulus of asphalt
   binders suggested that the Huet model can be used for inter-converting
   data obtained in time and frequency domains. This was not verified in
   the case of the asphalt mixtures complex modulus data due to
   experimental limitations.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes an agnostic inference strategy for material

   evaluation methods which extract information about structural anomalies
   from the analysis of acoustic wavefields measured on the structure's

   approach couples spatiotemporal windowing with low rank plus outlier
   modeling, to identify a priori unknown deviations in the propagating
   wavefields caused by material inhomogeneities or defects, using
   virtually no knowledge of the structural and material properties of the
   medium. This characteristic makes the approach particularly suitable for
   diagnostics scenarios in which the mechanical and material models are
   complex, unknown, or unreliable. We demonstrate our approach in a

   problems based on propagating flexural waves in a thin plate.}},

Abstract = {{Fluid flow and heat transfer of mixed convection from a constant wall
   temperature circular cylinder in zero-mean velocity oscillating cooling
   flows have been simulated based on the projection method with two
   dimensional exponential stretched staggered cylindrical meshes. Cycle
   mean temperature and secondary streaming are obtained by the method of
   partial sums of the Fourier series. Present numerical results are
   validated by comparing the heat transfer results of free convection and
   the secondary streaming of pure oscillating flow over a circular
   cylinder to published experimental and numerical results. The complete
   structures of the cycle mean temperature and secondary streaming
   patterns are provided by numerical simulations over wide ranges of the
   Reynolds number, the Keulegan-Carpenter number and the Richardson
   number. Based on turning points of the curves of the overall Nusselt
   numbers versus Reynolds numbers and the characteristics of the cycle
   averaged temperature and flow patterns, the heat transfer can be divided
   into three linear regimes (conduction, laminar convection, and turbulent
   convection dominated regimes) and two non-linear transition regimes. The
   effects of wave directions, amplitudes, frequencies, and buoyancy forces
   on the enhancement of heat transfer are also investigated. The effective
   ranges of the governing parameters for heat transfer enhancement are

Abstract = {{Objective: Low intensity vibration as a therapeutic and training
   modality has received increased attention despite the lack of clear
   mechanistic pathways. Thus, to determine mechanisms underpinning
   vibration-induced musculoskeletal adaptations, a vibration platform for
   mice was designed, constructed, and validated. Methods: Critical aspects
   of the platform include use of off-the-shelf components to (1) tailor
   individual parameter selection (acceleration and frequency), (2) produce
   low error across the plate's surface and throughout the range of
   vibration parameters, and (3) utilize accelerometer feedback to ensure
   fidelity within and between bouts of vibration. The vibration device is
   controlled by a centrally-mounted linear actuator on the underside of
   the platform that is modulated by accelerometer feedback. Results:
   Triaxial accelerometers confirmed that vibrations were purely vertical
   and acceleration responses were within 5\% of target stimuli for all
   accelerations (0.2-1.0 g) and frequencies (25-90 Hz). The platform
   produced acceleration responses with <= 4\% error between 25-90 Hz.
   Vibration modes were not detected indicating that the circular plate
   produced uniform stimuli across the platform (error <= 1.1\%, P=0.23)
   and mouse body mass did not affect the platform's performance (P=0.43).
   Conclusions: Our vibration device for mice improves upon existing
   devices and enables precise, low intensity mechanical signals to be
   applied with confidence.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{131-144}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Traditionally, offset optimization for coordinated traffic signals is
   based on average travel times between intersections and average traffic
   volumes at each intersection, without consideration of the stochastic
   nature of field traffic. Using the archived high-resolution traffic
   signal data, in this paper, we develop a data-driven arterial offset
   optimization model which will take two well-known problems with
   vehicle-actuated signal coordination into consideration: the early
   return to green problem and the uncertain intersection queue length
   problem. To account for the early return to green problem, we introduce
   the concept of conditional distribution of the green start times for the
   coordinated phase. To handle the uncertainty of intersection queue
   length, we adopt a scenario-based approach that generates optimal
   offsets using a series of traffic demand scenarios as the input to the
   optimization model. Both the conditional distributions of the green
   start times and traffic demand scenarios can be obtained from the
   archived high-resolution traffic signal data. Under different traffic
   conditions, queues formed by side-street and main-street traffic are
   explicitly considered in the derivation of intersection delay. The
   objective of this offset optimization model is to minimize total delay
   for the main coordinated direction and at the same time it considers the
   performance of the opposite direction. Due to the model complexity, a
   genetic algorithm is adopted to obtain the optimal solution. The
   proposed methodology was tested on a major arterial (TH55) in Minnesota.
   The results from the field implementation show that the proposed model
   can reduce travel delay of coordinated direction significantly without
   compromising the performance of the opposite approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{12}},

Abstract = {{Management strategies for horses with respiratory disease include
   soaking hay before feeding. Hay steaming is an alternative to this
   practice; however, little is known about its impact on forage nutritive
   values or intake. The objective was to determine the effect of steaming
   on forage nutritive value and intake by horses. Two alfalfa (Medicago
   sativa L.)-orchard-grass (Dactylis glomerata L.) mixed hays were
   evaluated: a low moldy (NM) and moderately moldy (MM) hay. Six mature
   horses were used in a 10 d crossover design. Three horses were assigned
   to each hay type and treatments were switched on d 6. Each day, one bale
   of each hay was sampled (pre- and poststeaming) and steamed for 90 min
   using a commercial hay steamer. Two flakes of steamed or unsteamed NM or
   MM hay were weighed and offered simultaneously to each horse in
   individual hay nets. Horses were allowed access to hay for 2 h, orts
   were collected, and 2 h DMI was calculated. Six additional bales of NM
   and MM were used to evaluate the effect of steaming on total suspended
   particulate (TSP). Flakes of unsteamed or steamed hay were agitated in
   an electric cement mixer, and TSP were recorded every min for 30 min
   using a tapered element oscillating microbalance sampler. Paired t tests
   and PROC MIXED of SAS (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC) were used to compare
   steamed and unsteamed hay nutritive values, mold concentration, TSP, and
   2 h DMI. Steaming increased hay moisture and therefore reduced DM to 77
   and 81\% for NM and MM, respectively (P < 0.001). In NM and MM hay,
   steaming reduced P content by 16 and 17\%, respectively (P <= 0.007).
   Steaming reduced water-soluble carbohydrates (WSC) and ethanol-soluble
   carbohydrates (ESC) by 13\% (P = 0.001) and 27\% (P = 0.003),
   respectively, for MM but had no effect on NM (P > 0.05). Steaming
   reduced mold concentrations in both hays by >= 91\% (P < 0.001). Total
   suspended particulate of MM hay was reduced by 55\% (P = 0.043), but TSP
   in NM hay was not affected by steaming (P = 0.445). Dry matter intake of
   NM was increased by steaming; horses ingested 0.64 kg of unsteamed and
   2.02 kg of steamed hay (P < 0.001). Dry matter intake of MM was not
   affected by steaming (P > 0.05). For NM hay, steaming decreased P and
   mold concentrations and increased DMI of the hay but had no effect on
   TSP. In MM hay, steaming reduced P, WSC, ESC, mold concentrations, and
   TSP but did not affect DMI. Steaming represents a strategy for reducing
   TSP and mold concentrations and increasing DMI in some hays but can
   result in leaching of essential nutrients.}},

Abstract = {{In the rendezvous search problem, two robots at unknown locations must
   successfully meet somewhere in the environment. We study the symmetric
   version of the problem in which they must use the same strategy. We
   provide a new algorithm for the symmetric rendezvous problem on the
   line. Our symmetric strategy has a competitive ratio of 17.686 for total
   distance traveled and a competitive ratio of 24.843 for total time. Both
   are improvements over the previously best-known algorithm, which has
   (time and distance) a competitive ratio of 26.650. Our algorithm can be
   adapted for bounded linear environments and simple closed curves with
   the same performance guarantees. It is also robust with respect to
   errors in motion and differences in robots' starting times. We confirm
   our theoretical results through simulations and show that our algorithms
   are practical by reporting the results of real robot deployments in
   indoor environments.}},

Abstract = {{This study systematically compares the effects of amphiphilic diblock
   copolymer (di-BCP) on stabilizing hydrophobic drug nanoparticles formed
   by flash nanoprecipitation (FNP), and provides a guideline on choosing
   suitable di-BCPs. Four widely used di-BCPs, i.e.,
   polystyrene-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PS-b-PEG),
   polycaprolactone-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PCL-b-PEG),
   polylactide-block-poly(ethylene glycol) (PLA-b-PEG), and
   poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA-b-PEG), and beta-carotene as a model
   drug were used. The study showed that PLGA-b-PEG was the most suitable
   one, whose hydrophobic block was biodegradable and noncrystallizable as
   well as had relatively high glass transition temperature (T-g) and a
   right solubility parameter (delta). The molecular weight of PLGA block
   over the range from 5k to 15k showed an insignificant effect on
   controlling the particle size. Amorphous drug particles with a high drug
   loading of over 83 wt\% can be achieved. Much remarkable evidence
   supported the nanoparticles with kinetically frozen and non-equilibrium
   packing structures of polymer chains rather than either the micelles or
   micellar nanoparticles with two well segregated polymer blocks. The
   thermodynamic effects of the drug and BCP on the particle stability,
   size and structures were discussed by using solubility parameters. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper is concerned with large-scale integration of demand response
   (DR) from small loads such as residential smart appliances into modern
   electricity systems. These appliances have intertemporal consumption
   constraints, while the satisfaction of the end-user from operating them
   is captured through utility functions. Incorporation of the appliance
   scheduling flexibility and user satisfaction in the system optimization
   points to maximizing the social welfare. In order to solve the resultant
   very large optimization problem with manageable complexity, dual
   decomposition is pursued. The problem decouples into separate
   subproblems for the market operator and each aggregator. Each aggregator
   addresses its local optimization aided by the end-users' smart meters.
   The subproblems are coordinated with carefully designed information
   exchanges between the market operator and the aggregators so that user
   privacy is preserved. Numerical tests illustrate the benefits of
   large-scale DR incorporation.}},

Abstract = {{A demand response (DR) problem is considered entailing a set of
   devices/subscribers, whose operating conditions are modeled using
   mixed-integer constraints. Device operational periods and power
   consumption levels are optimized in response to dynamic pricing
   information to balance user satisfaction and energy cost. Renewable
   energy resources and energy storage systems are also incorporated. Since
   DR becomes more effective as the number of participants grows,
   scalability is ensured through a parallel distributed algorithm, in
   which a DR coordinator and DR subscribers solve individual subproblems,
   guided by certain coordination signals. As the problem scales, the
   recovered solution becomes near-optimal. Robustness to random variations
   in electricity price and renewable generation is effected through robust
   optimization techniques. Real-time extension is also discussed.
   Numerical tests validate the proposed approach.}},

   both cases the uncoupled dynamics are governed by a nonlinear system
   that admits an asymptotically stable limit cycle. We provide two-time
   scale averaging methods for certifying stability of spatially
   homogeneous time-periodic trajectories in the presence of sufficiently
   small or large diffusion and develop methods using the structured
   singular value for the case of intermediate diffusion. We highlight
   cases where diffusion stabilizes or destabilizes such trajectories. (C)

Abstract = {{Microenvironmental mechanics play an important role in determining the
   morphology, traction, migration, proliferation, and differentiation of
   cells. A stochastic motor-clutch model has been proposed to describe
   this stiffness sensitivity. In this work, we present a master
   equation-based ordinary differential equation (ODE) description of the
   motor-clutch model, from which we derive an analytical expression to for
   a cell's optimum stiffness (i.e., the stiffness at which the traction
   force is maximal). This analytical expression provides insight into the
   requirements for stiffness sensing by establishing fundamental
   relationships between the key controlling cell-specific parameters. We
   find that the fundamental controlling parameters are the numbers of
   motors and clutches (constrained to be nearly equal), and the time scale
   of the on-off kinetics of the clutches (constrained to favor clutch
   binding over clutch unbinding). Both the ODE solution and the analytical
   expression show good agreement with Monte Carlo motor-clutch output, and
   reduce computation time by several orders of magnitude, which
   potentially enables long time scale behaviors (hours-days) to be studied
   computationally in an efficient manner. The ODE solution and the
   analytical expression may be incorporated into larger scale models of
   cellular behavior to bridge the gap from molecular time scales to
   cellular and tissue time scales.}},

Abstract = {{A moving tomographic particle image velocimetry method was designed and
   implemented to measure temporal evolution of velocity fields in three-

   hairpin structures and eddy packets was examined at two locations in the
   logarithmic region: z(+) = 100-300 and 300-500. Meandering, merging and
   breaking of long slow regions associated with packets were observed. The
   meandering of long slow regions at both wall-normal locations was
   tracked using cross-correlation between neighboring time steps. It was
   found that long slow regions could persist within the logarithmic region
   over a travel distance of 15 delta corresponding to a time period 24.3
   delta/U-infinity (t(+) > 2,300) and that the packet regions could travel
   stably forward in the streamwise direction while maintaining fixed
   spanwise inclinations in the range 0 degrees-10 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a framework to study the impact of stochastic active/reactive
   power injections on power system dynamics with a focus on time scales
   involving electromechanical phenomena. In this framework, the
   active/reactive power injections evolve according to a continuous-time
   Markov chain (CTMC), while the power system dynamics are described by
   the standard differential algebraic equation (DAE) model. The DAE model
   is linearized around a nominal set of active/reactive power injections,
   and the combination of the linearized DAE model and the CTMC forms a
   stochastic process known as a stochastic hybrid system (SHS). The
   extended generator of the SHS yields a system of ordinary differential
   equations that governs the evolution of the power system dynamic and
   algebraic state moments. We illustrate the application of the framework
   to the computation of long-term power system state statistics, and to
   short-term probabilistic dynamic performance/reliability assessment.}},

Journal = {{INVERSE PROBLEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study the method of topological sensitivity (TS) for solving
   inverse scattering problems, previously supported by a broad set of
   numerical simulations, is put to test experimentally with the focus on
   2D obstacle reconstruction in a thin aluminum plate via elastic waves.
   To this end, the in-plane measurements of transient elastodynamic
   waveforms along the edges of the plate are effected in a non-contact
   fashion by a 3D laser Doppler vibrometer. Using an elastodynamic
   (time-domain) finite element model as a computational platform, the TS
   reconstruction maps are obtained and analyzed under varying experimental
   conditions. The results show significant agreement between the defect
   geometry and its reconstruction, thus demonstrating the utility of the
   TS approach as an efficient and robust solution tool for this class of
   inverse problems. For completeness, the experimental investigation
   includes a set of parametric studies geared toward exposing the effect
   of key problem parameters on the quality of obstacle reconstruction such
   as the (dominant) excitation frequency, the source aperture, and the
   duration of the temporal record. On the analytical front, it is shown
   that the use of a suitable temporal windowing function in specifying the
   L-2 cost functional (that underpins the TS formulation) is essential
   from both theoretical and computational points of view.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{To date, most collision cross section (CCS) predictions have invoked gas
   molecule impingement-reemission rules in which specular and elastic
   scattering of spherical gas molecules from rigid polyatomic surfaces are
   assumed. Although such predictions have been shown to agree well with
   CCSs measured in helium bath gas, a number of studies reveal that these
   predictions do not agree with CCSs for ions in diatomic gases, namely,
   air and molecular nitrogen. To further examine the validity of
   specular-elastic versus diffuse-inelastic scattering models, we measured
   the CCSs of positively charged metal iodide cluster ions of the form
   {[}MI](n){[}M+](z), where M = Na, K, Rb, or Cs, n = 1 - 25, and z = 1 -
   2. Measurements were made in air via differential mobility analysis mass
   spectrometry (DMA-MS). The CCSs measured are compared with
   specular-elastic as well as diffuse-inelastic scattering model
   predictions with candidate ion structures determined from density
   functional theory. It is found that predictions from diffuse-inelastic
   collision models agree well (within 5 \%) with measurements from sodium
   iodide cluster ions, while specular-elastic collision model predictions
   are in better agreement with cesium iodide cluster ion measurements. The
   agreement with diffuse-inelastic and specular-elastic predictions
   decreases and increases, respectively, with increasing cation mass.
   However, even when diffuse-inelastic cluster ion predictions disagree
   with measurements, the disagreement is of a near-constant factor for all
   ions, indicating that a simple linear rescaling collapses predictions to
   measurements. Conversely, rescaling cannot be used to collapse
   specular-elastic predictions to measurements; hence, although the
   precise impingement reemission rules remain ambiguous, they are not
   specular-elastic.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the feasibility and acute safety of targeting
   atherosclerotic plaques by high-intensity focused ultrasound (US) in
   vivo through a noninvasive extracorporeal approach.
   Materials And Methods: Four swine were included in this prospective
   study, three of which were familial hypercholesterolemic swine. The
   procedure was done under general anesthesia. After US identification of
   atherosclerotic plaques within the femoral arteries, plaques were
   targeted by high-intensity focused US with an integrated dual-mode US
   array system. Different ablation protocols were used to meet the study
   objectives, and animals were then euthanized at different time points.
   Targeted arterial segments were stained by hematoxylin and eosin for
   histopathologic examination. Numeric values are presented as means +/-
   standard deviation.
   Results: All swine tolerated the procedure well, with no arterial
   dissection, perforation, or rupture. Discrete lesions were detected in
   the first two swine, measuring 0.54 mm +/- 0.10 and 0.25 mm +/- 0.03 in
   cross-sectional dimensions in the first and 0.50 mm +/- 0.12 and 0.24 mm
   +/- 0.15 in the second. Confluent ablation zones were identified in the
   last two swine, measuring 6.92 mm and 0.93 mm in the third and 2.97 mm
   and 2.52 mm in the fourth. Lesions showed necrotic cores and peripheral
   reactive inflammatory infiltration. The endothelium overlying targeted
   arterial segments remained intact.
   Conclusions: The results demonstrate the feasibility and acute safety of
   targeting atherosclerotic plaques by high-intensity-focused US in vivo.
   Further long-term studies are needed to assess how induction of these
   lesions can modify the progression of atherosclerotic plaques.}},

Abstract = {{Heritability (h(2)) represents the potential for short-term response of
   a quantitative trait to selection. Unfortunately, estimating h(2)
   through traditional crossing experiments is not practical for many
   species, and even for those in which mating can be manipulated, it may
   not be possible to assay them in ecologically relevant environments. We
   evaluated an approach, GCTA, that uses relatedness estimated from
   genomic data to estimate the proportion of phenotypic variance due to
   genotyped SNPs, which can be used to infer h(2). Using phenotypic and
   genotypic data from eight replicates of experimentally grown plants of
   the annual legume Medicago truncatula, we examined how h(2) estimates
   from GCTA (h(GCTA)(2)) related to traditional estimates of heritability
   (clonal repeatability for these inbred lines). Further, we examined how
   h(GCTA)(2) estimates were affected by SNP number, minor allele
   frequency, the number of individuals assayed and the exclusion of
   causative SNPs. We found that the average h(GCTA)(2) estimates for each
   trait made with the full data set (> 5 million SNPs, 200 individuals)
   were strongly correlated (r = 0.99) with estimates of clonal
   repeatability. However, this result masks considerable variation among
   replicate estimates of h(GCTA)(2), even in relatively uniform greenhouse
   conditions. h(GCTA)(2) estimates with 250000 and 25000 SNPs were very
   similar to those obtained with > 5 million SNPs, but with 2500 SNPs,
   h(GCTA)(2) were lower and had higher variance than those with >= 25 k
   SNPs. h(GCTA)(2) estimates were slightly lower when only common SNPs
   were used. Excluding putatively causative SNPs had little effect on the
   estimates of h(GCTA)(2), suggesting that genotyping putatively causative
   SNPs is not necessary to obtain accurate estimates of h(2). The number
   of accessions sampled had the greatest effect on h(GCTA)(2) estimates,
   and variance greatly increased as fewer accessions were included. With
   only 50 accessions sampled, the range of h(GCTA)(2) ranged from 0 to 1
   for all traits. These results indicate that the GCTA method may be
   useful for estimating h(2) using data sets of a size that are available
   from reduced-representation genotyping but that hundreds of individuals
   may need to be sampled to obtain robust estimates of h(2).}},

Abstract = {{Optical constants of ceria are determined in the visible and
   near-infrared spectral ranges. Two techniques are employed to obtain the
   index of refraction. The first technique is a direct procedure which
   involves analysis of wave interference in the transmission spectrum of a
   ceria thin film. The second technique is an indirect procedure that
   involves analysis of transmission and reflection spectrum of ceria with
   sintered morphology. The index of absorption is obtained in the spectral
   range of weak absorption using the indirect procedure. The identified
   index of absorption is in turn used in an alternative approach based on
   the subtractive Kramers-Kronig relation to estimate the spectral
   dependence of the index of refraction. The index of refraction
   identified from the measured transmittance of the thin film is
   qualitatively consistent with that found in the literature. The
   subtractive Kramers-Kronig analysis indicates that the spectral
   dependence of the index of refraction in the transparency range is
   highly sensitive to the absorption spectrum in the neighboring spectral
   range of strong absorption, and it is insensitive to the absorption
   spectrum in the spectral range of weak absorption.}},

Abstract = {{The study of hydrocephalus and the modeling of cerebrospinal fluid flow
   have proceeded in the past using mathematical analysis that was very
   capable of prediction phenomenonologically but not well in physiologic
   parameters. In this paper, the basis of fluid dynamics at the
   physiologic state is explained using first established equations of
   transport phenomenon. Then, microscopic and molecular level techniques
   of modeling are described using porous media theory and chemical kinetic
   theory and then applied to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) dynamics. Using
   techniques of transport analysis allows the field of cerebrospinal fluid
   dynamics to approach the level of sophistication of urine and blood
   transport. Concepts such as intra-cellular and intercellular pathways,
   compartmentalization, and tortuosity are associated with quantifiable
   parameters that are relevant to the anatomy and physiology of
   cerebrospinal fluid transport. The engineering field of transport
   phenomenon is rich and steeped in architectural, aeronautical, nautical,
   and more recently biological history. This paper summarizes and reviews
   the approaches that have been taken in the field of engineering and
   applies it to CSF flow.}},

Abstract = {{A novel tissue-engineered heart valve (TEHV) was fabricated from a
   decellularized tissue tube mounted on a frame with three struts, which
   upon back-pressure cause the tube to collapse into three coapting
   ``leaflets.{''} The tissue was completely biological, fabricated from
   ovine fibroblasts dispersed within a fibrin gel, compacted into a
   circumferentially aligned tube on a mandrel, and matured using a
   bioreactor system that applied cyclic distension. Following
   decellularization, the resulting tissue possessed tensile mechanical
   properties, mechanical anisotropy, and collagen content that were
   comparable to native pulmonary valve leaflets. When mounted on a custom
   frame and tested within a pulse duplicator system, the tubular TEHV
   displayed excellent function under both aortic and pulmonary conditions,
   with minimal regurgitant fractions and transvalvular pressure gradients
   at peak systole, as well as well as effective orifice areas exceeding
   those of current commercially available valve replacements. Short-term
   fatigue testing of one million cycles with pulmonary pressure gradients
   was conducted without significant change in mechanical properties and no
   observable macroscopic tissue deterioration. This study presents an
   attractive potential alternative to current tissue valve replacements
   due to its avoidance of chemical fixation and utilization of a tissue
   conducive to recellularization by host cell infiltration.}},

Abstract = {{Many highway bridges in the United States are reaching their intended
   design lives and are in need of attention. To avoid replacing these
   bridges simultaneously, methodologies to safely extend their lives are
   important to help avoid high replacement costs and to allow for bridge
   replacement to occur over a longer time window. This paper expands an
   approach to extend the fatigue life of vulnerable steel bridges through
   a response modification (RM) apparatus, consisting of a mechanical
   amplifier and a RM device, which provide efficient supplemental
   stiffness and damping to the bridge. Because of the relatively small
   deflections encountered under typical service loads, the use of a
   mechanical amplifier allows for a more efficient and less intrusive
   apparatus to provide the required RM forces imparted to the bridge for
   increased bridge life. This paper presents a parameter study exploring
   the flexibility of the elements in the RM apparatus, the length of the
   apparatus, and the characteristics of the RM device. The analyses also
   add superstructure damping and other model improvements to a
   comprehensive numerical model of a realistic in-service bridge. The
   paper carries out dynamic analyses in the frequency domain to ensure the
   robustness of the RM apparatuses for various loading frequencies. The
   most important characteristic of the RM apparatus is found to be the
   cross-sectional area of the members. Additionally, the parameter study
   showed that a smaller apparatus is most cost effective. Finally, the
   dynamic analyses showed that the use of a semiactive device may be
   beneficial to the effectiveness of the RM approach. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{In this paper, radiative characterization of a packed bed of novel
   three-dimensionally ordered macroporous (3DOM) ceria particles is
   performed in the spectral range relevant to solar thermochemical
   processes, 0.35-2.2 mu m. Normal-hemispherical transmittance and
   reflectance of three samples of various thicknesses are measured. Monte
   Carlo ray-tracing (MCRT) and discrete ordinate methods are employed to
   identify transport scattering albedo and transport extinction
   coefficient in the spectral range corresponding to weak absorption in
   the semi-transparency band of ceria. 3DOM ceria particles are
   characterized by weaker scattering in comparison to sintered ceria
   ceramics, and increased transparency in the near-infrared spectral range
   0.7-2 mu m. The ordered pore-morphology of the 3DOM ceria after
   thermochemical redox cycling between temperatures 1373 K and 1073 K is
   altered due to sintering of walls of the 3DOM structure. The absorption
   coefficient of the packed bed is found to be practically independent of
   morphology. Radiative characterization of 3DOM ceria ceramics before and
   after thermochemical cycling suggests that preserving the 3DOM structure
   can lead to scattering characteristics that permit longer attenuation
   path lengths of incident concentrated solar radiation in the material,
   as well as be favorable for confinement of the near-infrared radiation
   during thermochemical cycling leading to favorable thermochemical
   conditions for fuel production.}},

Title = {{Measurement study on P2P streaming systems}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SUPERCOMPUTING}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Originally used as the default infrastructure for efficient file
   sharing, peer-to-peer (P2P) architecture achieved great successes. Now,
   the P2P model has been adopted for many other distributed applications,
   such as instant message and phone services, Internet gaming, and
   large-scale scientific computing. In recent years, P2P streaming systems
   experienced tremendous growth and became one of the largest bandwidth
   consumers on the Internet. Compared to standard file sharing systems,
   the streaming services show unique characteristics with more stringent
   time constraints and require much higher network bandwidth. It is
   extremely important to evaluate and analyze existing applications, and
   investigate the merits and weaknesses in these systems for future
   development.
   In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive measurement study on two of
   the most popular P2P streaming systems, namely, PPLive and PPStream.
   They are very popular P2P streaming applications, and serving millions
   of registered users with hundreds of live TV channels and millions of
   other video clips. In our measurement, we deploy our collectors in
   China, and both live TV and video-on-demand (VoD) channels are
   evaluated. We record run-time network traffic on the client side,
   compare and analyze the characteristics of these channels based on their
   popularity. For both categories, we perceive that, in general, the two
   measured P2P streaming systems provide satisfactory experience to the
   audiences for all channels regardless of popularity. However, the most
   of data are downloaded from the dedicated servers for unpopular
   channels. We also observe that live TV channels show better peer
   coordination than VoD channels. Beside the traffic, we have also
   collected cache replacement information for VoD channels, and these
   measurement results can help us understand the caching mechanism of P2P
   streaming systems. With the support of the cache, VoD channels perform
   better than their counterparts in the live TV category in terms of data
   transmission, workload distribution, and signal traffic overhead.
   Overall, our results reveal that although P2P streaming systems can
   usually provide excellent viewing experience for popular channels, there
   are still challenges to fully support unpopular channels. New designs
   and algorithms are in urgent need, especially for unpopular live TV
   channels.}},

Abstract = {{Maxwell's concept of an equivalent inhomogeneity is employed for
   evaluating the effective elastic properties of tetragonal,

   problem of a finite cluster of isotropic, circular cylindrical fibers
   embedded in an infinite isotropic matrix with that for the problem of a
   single, tetragonal, circular cylindrical equivalent inhomogeneity
   embedded in the same isotropic matrix. The former solutions precisely
   account for the interactions between all fibers in the cluster and for
   their geometrical arrangement. The solutions to several example problems
   that involve periodic (square arrays) composites demonstrate that the
   approach adequately captures microstructure induced anisotropy of the

Title = {{Entropic stabilization of austenite in shape memory alloys}},

Abstract = {{Martensitic transformations (MTs) are the key phenomena responsible for
   the remarkable properties of Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs). Recent Density
   Functional Theory (DFT) electronic structure calculations have revealed
   that the austenite structure of many SMAs is a saddle-point of the
   material's potential energy landscape. Correspondingly, the austenite is
   unstable and thus unobservable at zero temperature. Thus, the observable
   high temperature austenite structure in many SMAs is entropically
   stabilized by nonlinear dynamic effects.
   This paper discusses the phenomenon of entropic stabilization of the
   austenite phase in SMAs and explicitly demonstrates it using Molecular
   Dynamics (MD) and a three-dimensional all-atom potential energy model
   whose equilibria crystal structures correspond to commonly observed SMA
   phases. A new technique is used to carefully select a model so that it
   is likely to lead to entropic stabilization of a B2 cubic austenite from
   a B19 orthorhombic martensite. This is accomplished by using a detailed
   branch-following and bifurcation (BFB) parametric study of the Morse
   pair potential binary alloy model. The results of the MD simulation
   clearly demonstrate the entropic stabilization of the B2 austenite phase
   at high temperature. Analysis of the dynamics of the B2 austenite phase
   indicates that its stabilization may be viewed as a result of individual
   atoms randomly visiting the B19 and alpha IrV phases (with only
   occasional visits to the B2 and L1(0) phases). This occurs without
   long-range correlations in such a way that each atom's time-average
   configuration corresponds to the B2 structure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{The Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo (GEMC) method is a versatile approach for
   the prediction of fluid phase equilibria from particle-based

   significant fraction of the computational effort is expended on special
   trial moves that transfer (swap) particles and exchange volume between
   the two boxes. The user needs to specify the frequency of swap and
   volume moves and the overall volume that controls the phase ratio. In
   this study, the efficiency of GEMC simulation protocols that yield three
   different frequencies of accepted swap and volume moves and three
   different phase ratios is assessed for the computation of the saturated
   vapour pressure and liquid density of n-octane and water at three
   reduced temperatures. Differences in the simulation efficiency of up to
   an order of magnitude are observed, and recommendations are made for
   suitable GEMC simulation protocols.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the effects of fuel chemistry and pellet
   configuration (void fraction, particle size) on MFC reaction rate and
   yield. Candidate hydrides were evaluated based on their suitability in a
   MFC using water vapor-driven hydrolysis, and lithium aluminum hydride
   (LiAlH4) was selected for evaluation. Hydrogen evolution tests were
   performed in a hydrolysis reactor with three particle size distributions
   (5 mu m, 20 mu m, and 50 mu m in mean diameter) and at three initial
   void fractions (86\%, 71\%, 43\%). Void fraction and particle size are
   found to affect reaction rates, but have no impact on reaction yields
   (all were similar to 100\%) within the range tested. Higher void
   fraction and smaller particle size are correlated with faster reaction
   rates.
   Electrical discharge tests are performed on a MFC at a constant
   potential of 1.2 V at three particle sizes (5 mu m, 20 mu m, 50 mu m) at
   a 32\% initial void fraction. Tests in the MFC reveal the strong impact
   of particle sizes on reaction rates, and show that reaction rates
   decrease with increasing particle size. Reaction yields are lower
   (90-93\%) in the MFC, which is attributed to a small hydrogen leak. The
   energy density of the MFC is 1003 Wh L-1, the highest reported to date.

Abstract = {{We consider the problem of linear transceiver design to achieve max-min
   fairness in a downlink MIMO multicell network. This problem can be
   formulated as maximizing the minimum rate among all the users in an
   interfering broadcast channel (IBC). In this paper we show that when the
   number of antennas is at least two at each of the transmitters and the
   receivers, the min rate maximization problem is NP-hard in the number of
   users. Moreover, we develop a low-complexity algorithm for this problem
   by iteratively solving a sequence of convex subproblems. We
   theoretically establish the global convergence of the proposed algorithm
   to the set of stationary points, which may be suboptimal due to the
   non-convexity of the original minimum rate maximization problem.
   Numerical simulations show that this algorithm is efficient in achieving
   fairness among all the users. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{60}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wake flows downstream of hydrokinetic turbines are characterized by hub
   and tip vortices, a velocity deficit and an increase in turbulence
   intensity. Velocity and turbulence recovery in the wakes of individual
   turbines constrains the density of turbines in an array and limits the
   amount of energy that can be produced by a turbine farm. However, few
   hydrokinetic turbine flow recovery studies have been conducted,
   especially on the far-field flow characteristics. Nor have studies
   evaluated the accuracy of acoustic Doppler profiler measurements in the
   wakes of turbines. The present study examines vertical profiles of mean
   velocity and turbulence, as well as longitudinal profiles of velocity
   deficit and turbulence levels measured at the symmetry plane of a model
   three-blade axial flow turbine in a large open channel flow. Mean
   velocity and turbulence statistics are measured using an acoustic
   Doppler velocimeter (ADV) and a pulse coherent acoustic Doppler profiler
   (ADP). ADV and corrected-ADP derived values of mean velocity, turbulence
   intensity and root-mean-square velocity constitute a well-documented
   data set that can be used to validate numerical models simulating the
   effects of hydrokinetic turbine arrays. We found that 80\% of the flow
   recovery occurred about ten diameters downstream from the rotor plane,
   which suggests that practical values for longitudinal spacing of
   turbines should be between ten and fifteen diameters. Significant errors
   observed in mean velocity and turbulence statistics derived from ADP
   measurements in the near wake region raise concerns on the use of these
   instruments for such measurements in lab and field studies. Although the
   cause of some of the errors requires further investigation, we show that
   errors in turbulence intensity can be successfully corrected with
   supplemental ADV measurements. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The viscosity of poly(styrene)-b-poly(lactide) {[}PS-b-PLA] solutions in
   a neutral solvent was characterized by magnetic microrheology. The
   effect of polymer concentration on the viscosity of the block polymer
   solutions was compared with that of the PS and PLA homopolymers in the
   same solvent. The viscosity of PS-b-PLA solution, unlike the homopolymer
   solutions, showed a steep increase over a narrow concentration range.
   The steep rise was concomitant with microphase separation into an
   ordered cylindrical microstructure as determined by small-angle X-ray
   scattering. Hence microrheology proved effective as a means of
   characterizing the order-disorder transition concentration. During an in
   situ drying experiment, changes in local viscosity through the depth of
   a block copolymer solution were characterized as a function of drying
   time. Early in the drying process, the viscosity rose steadily and was
   uniform through the depth, a result consistent with steadily increasing
   and uniform polymer concentration. However, later in the drying process
   as the overall polymer concentration approached that required for
   microphase separation, the viscosity of the polymer solution near the
   free surface became an order of magnitude higher than that near the
   bottom of the container. The zone of high viscosity moved downward as
   drying proceeded, consistent with a microphase separation front.}},

Title = {{Using dominant eigenvalue analysis to predict formation of alternans in
   the heart}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{NOV 22}},
Abstract = {{Ventricular fibrillation at the whole heart level is often preceded by
   the alternation of action potential duration (APD), i.e., alternans, at
   the cellular level. As proven in many experiments, traditional
   approaches based on the slope of the restitution curve have not been
   successful in predicting alternans formation. Recently, a technique has
   been theoretically developed based on dominant eigenvalue analysis to
   predict alternans formation in isolated cardiac myocytes. Here, we aimed
   to demonstrate that this technique can be applied to predict alternans
   formation at the whole heart level. Optical mapping was performed in
   Langendorff-perfused hearts from New Zealand white rabbits (n = 4),
   which were paced at decreasing basic cycle lengths to introduce APD
   alternans. In each heart, the basic cycle length corresponding to the
   local onset of alternans, B-onset, was determined and two regions of the
   heart were identified at B-onset: one region which exhibited alternans
   (1:1(alt)) and one which did not (1:1). Corresponding two-dimensional
   eigenvalue (lambda) maps were generated using principal component
   analysis by analyzing action potentials after short perturbations from
   the steady state, and mean eigenvalues ((lambda) over bar) were
   calculated separately for the 1:1 and 1:1(alt) regions. We demonstrated
   that (lambda) over bar calculated at B-onset was significantly different
   (p<0.05) between the two regions. Our results suggest that this dominant
   eigenvalue technique can be used to successfully predict the local
   alternans formation in the heart.}},

Abstract = {{The transferable potentials for phase equilibria (TraPPE) force field is
   extended to all-silica zeolites. This novel force field is parametrized
   to match the experimental adsorption isotherms of n-heptane, propane,
   carbon dioxide, and ethanol with the Lennard-Jones parameters for
   sorbate-framework interactions determined in a consistent manner using
   the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules as for other parts of the TraPPE
   force field. The TraPPE-zeo force field allows for accurate predictions
   for both adsorption and diffusion of alkanes, alcohols, carbon dioxide,
   and water over a wide range of pressures and temperatures. In order to
   achieve transferability to a wider range of molecule types, ranging from
   nonpolar to dipolar and hydrogen-bonding compounds, Lennard-Jones
   interaction sites and partial charges are placed at both the oxygen and
   the silicon atoms of the zeolite lattice, which allows for a better
   balance of dispersive and first-order electrostatic interactions than is
   achievable with the Lennard-Jones potential used only for the oxygen
   atoms. The use of the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules for unlike
   interactions makes the TraPPE-zeo force field applicable to any sorbate
   as long as the relevant TraPPE sorbate-sorbate parameters are available.
   The TraPPE-zeo force field allows for greatly improved predictive power
   compared to force fields that explicitly tabulate the individual
   cross-interaction parameters.}},

Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{This review summarizes the state of the art of plasma diagnostics on
   atmospheric pressure plasmas formed at characteristic length scales of
   approximately 1 mm or smaller and identifies challenges and prospects.
   Both plasmas generated in confined geometries, so-called microplasmas,
   as well as discharge filaments occurring in commonly filamentary
   plasmas, e.g. microdischarges in dielectric barrier discharges are
   covered. In spite of the differences between microplasmas which often
   obtain a quasi steady state and single microdischarges or filaments
   which are self limited in space and time and thus intrinsically
   transient, both face very similar diagnostic challenges of which two are
   immediately apparent: the high collisionality which requires adaptations
   of standard plasmas diagnostics often developed for low pressure
   plasmas, and the requirements on high spatial resolution due to the
   strong gradients in plasma properties. The complexity of the plasma
   generation and the physical and chemical properties of the above
   mentioned plasmas requires the knowledge of an extensive series of
   different parameters to obtain a full characterization. As the results
   of the diagnostics are not always unambiguous and require a detailed
   understanding of plasma physics and chemistry, a summary of the main
   properties and pecularities of high pressure plasmas is included in this
   review.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive Waterjet Machining (AWM) and Electrical Discharge Machining
   (EDM) processes are found to produce nanoparticles during operation.
   Impacts of engineered nanoparticles released to the environment and
   biological system have caused much concern. Similarly, the nanoparticles
   unintentionally produced by the AWM and EDM can lead to comparable
   effects. By application of the Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA)
   technique, the size distribution and concentration of nanoparticles in
   the water used in AWM and EDM were measured. The particles generally
   have a peak size of 100-200 nm. The filtration systems of the AWM and
   EDM processes were found to remove 70\% and 90\% the nanoparticles
   present, respectively. However, the particle concentration of the
   filtered water from the AWM was still four times higher than that found
   in regular tap water. These nanoparticles are mostly agglomerated,
   according to the microscopy analysis. Using the electron dispersive
   spectroscopy (EDS) technique, the particles are confirmed to come from
   the debris of the materials cut with the equipment. Since AWM and EDM
   are widely used, the handling and disposal of used filters collected
   with nanoparticles, release of nanoparticles to the sewer, and potential
   use of higher performance filters for these processes will deserve
   further consideration.}},

Abstract = {{Air pollution in New Delhi, India, is a significant environmental and
   health concern. To assess determinants of variability in air pollutant
   concentrations, we develop land use regression (LUR) models for fine
   particulate matter (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), and ultrafine particle
   number concentrations (UFPN). We used 136 h (39 sites), 112 h (26
   sites), 147 h (39 sites) of PM2.5, BC, and UFPN data respectively, to
   develop separate morning (0800-1200) and afternoon (1200-1800) models.
   Continuous measurements of PM2.5 and BC were also made at a single fixed
   rooftop site located in a high-income residential neighborhood. No
   continuous measurements of UFPN were available. In addition to spatial
   variables, measurements from the fixed continuous monitoring site were
   used as independent variables in the PM2.5 and BC models. The median
   concentrations (and interquartile range) of PM2.5, BC, and UFPN at LUR
   sites were 133 (96-232) mu g m(-3), 11 (6-21) mu g m(-3), and 40 (27-72)
   X 10(3) cm(-3) respectively. In addition (a) for PM2.5 and BC, the
   temporal variability was higher than the spatial variability; (b) the
   magnitude and spatial variability in pollutant concentrations was higher
   during morning than during afternoon hours. Further, model R-2 values
   were higher for morning (for PM2.5, BC, and UFPN, respectively: 0.85,
   0.86, and 0.28) than for afternoon models (0.73, 0.69, and 0.23); (c)
   the PM2.5 and BC concentrations measured at LUR sites all over the city
   were strongly correlated with measured concentrations at a fixed rooftop
   site; (d) spatial patterns were similar for PM2.5 and BC but different
   for UFPN; (e) population density and road variables were statistically
   significant predictors of pollutant concentrations; and (f) available
   geographic predictors explained a much lower proportion of variability
   in measured PM2.5, BC, and UFPN than observed in other LUR studies,
   indicating the importance of temporal variability and suggesting the
   existence of uncharacterized sources.}},

   the out-of-plane lattice parameter was found to decrease hyperbolically
   in an excellent agreement with the relaxation via forming misfit

Title = {{An exact approach for studying cargo transport by an ensemble of
   molecular motors}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOPHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: Intracellular transport is crucial for many cellular
   processes where a large fraction of the cargo is transferred by
   motor-proteins over a network of microtubules. Malfunctions in the
   transport mechanism underlie a number of medical maladies. Existing
   methods for studying how motor-proteins coordinate the transfer of a
   shared cargo over a microtubule are either analytical or are based on
   Monte-Carlo simulations. Approaches that yield analytical results, while
   providing unique insights into transport mechanism, make simplifying
   assumptions, where a detailed characterization of important transport
   modalities is difficult to reach. On the other hand, Monte-Carlo based
   simulations can incorporate detailed characteristics of the transport
   mechanism; however, the quality of the results depend on the number and
   quality of simulation runs used in arriving at results. Here, for
   example, it is difficult to simulate and study rare-events that can
   trigger abnormalities in transport.
   Results: In this article, a semi-analytical methodology that determines
   the probability distribution function of motor-protein behavior in an
   exact manner is developed. The method utilizes a finite-dimensional
   projection of the underlying infinite-dimensional Markov model, which
   retains the Markov property, and enables the detailed and exact
   determination of motor configurations, from which meaningful inferences
   on transport characteristics of the original model can be derived.
   Conclusions: Under this novel probabilistic approach new insights about
   the mechanisms of action of these proteins are found, suggesting
   hypothesis about their behavior and driving the design and realization
   of new experiments. The advantages provided in accuracy and efficiency
   make it possible to detect rare events in the motor protein dynamics,
   that could otherwise pass undetected using standard simulation methods.
   In this respect, the model has allowed to provide a possible explanation
   for possible mechanisms under which motor proteins could coordinate
   their motion.}},

Title = {{Disc Degeneration Assessed by Quantitative T2{*}(T2 Star) Correlated

Journal = {{SPINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{E1533-E1540}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Study Design. Experimental correlation study design to quantify features
   of disc health, including signal intensity and distinction between the
   annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus, with T2{*} magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) and correlate with the functional mechanics in
   corresponding motion segments.
   Objective. Establish the relationship between disc health assessed by
   quantitative T2{*} MRI and functional lumbar mechanics.
   Summary of Background Data. Degeneration leads to altered biochemistry
   in the disc, affecting the mechanical competence. Clinical routine MRI
   sequences are not adequate in detecting early changes in degeneration
   and fails to correlate with pain or improve patient stratification.
   Quantitative T2{*} relaxation time mapping probes biochemical features
   and may offer more sensitivity in assessing disc degeneration.
   Methods. Cadaveric lumbar spines were imaged using quantitative T2{*}
   mapping, as well as conventional T2-weighted MRI sequences. Discs were
   graded by the Pfirrmann scale, and features of disc health, including
   signal intensity (T2{*} intensity area) and distinction between the
   annulus fibrosus and nucleus pulposus (transition zone slope), were
   quantified by T2{*}. Each motion segment was subjected to pure moment
   bending to determine range of motion (ROM), neutral zone (NZ), and
   bending stiffness.
   Results. T2{*} intensity area and transition zone slope were
   significantly correlated with flexion ROM (P = 0.015; P = 0.002), ratio
   of NZ/ROM (P = 0.010; P = 0.028), and stiffness (P = 0.044; P = 0.026),
   as well as lateral bending NZ/ROM (P = 0.005; P = 0.010) and stiffness
   (P = 0.022; P = 0.029). T2{*} intensity area was also correlated with
   lateral bending ROM (P = 0.023). Pfirrmann grade was only correlated
   with lateral bending NZ/ROM (P = 0.001) and stiffness (P = 0.007).
   Conclusion. T2{*} mapping is a sensitive quantitative method capable of
   detecting changes associated with disc degeneration. Features of disc
   health quantified with T2{*} predicted altered functional mechanics of
   the lumbar spine better than traditional Pfirrmann grading. This new
   methodology and analysis technique may enhance the assessment of
   degeneration and enable greater patient stratification for therapeutic
   strategies.}},

Title = {{The Local Dinucleotide Preference of APOBEC3G Can Be Altered from 5 `-CC

Abstract = {{APOBEC3A and APOBEC3G are DNA cytosine deaminases with biological
   functions in foreign DNA and retrovirus restriction, respectively.
   APOBEC3A has an intrinsic preference for cytosine preceded by thymine
   (5'-TC) in single-stranded DNA substrates, whereas APOBEC3G prefers the
   target cytosine to be preceded by another cytosine (5'-CC). To determine
   the amino acids responsible for these strong dinucleotide preferences,
   we analyzed a series of chimeras in which putative DNA binding loop
   regions of APOBEC3G were replaced with the corresponding regions from
   APOBEC3A. Loop 3 replacement enhanced APOBEC3G catalytic activity but
   did not alter its intrinsic 5'-CC dinucleotide substrate preference.
   Loop 7 replacement caused APOBEC3G to become APOBEC3A-like and strongly
   prefer 5'-TC substrates. Simultaneous loop 3/7 replacement resulted in a
   hyperactive APOBEC3G variant that also preferred 5'-TC dinucleotides.
   Single amino acid exchanges revealed D317 as a critical determinant of
   dinucleotide substrate specificity. Multi-copy explicitly solvated
   all-atom molecular dynamics simulations suggested a model in which D317
   acts as a helix-capping residue by constraining the mobility of loop 7,
   forming a novel binding pocket that favorably accommodates cytosine. All
   catalytically active APOBEC3G variants, regardless of dinucleotide
   preference, retained human immunodeficiency virus type 1 restriction
   activity. These data support a model in which the loop 7 region governs
   the selection of local dinucleotide substrates for deamination but is
   unlikely to be part of the higher level targeting mechanisms that direct
   these enzymes to biological substrates such as human immunodeficiency
   virus type 1 cDNA. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The liver is one of the few organs that possess a high capacity to
   regenerate after liver failure or liver damage. The parenchymal cells of
   the liver, hepatocytes, contribute to the majority of the regeneration
   process. Thus, hepatocyte transplantation presents an alternative method
   to treating liver damage. However, shortage of hepatocytes and
   difficulties in maintaining primary hepatocytes still remain key
   obstacles that researchers must overcome before hepatocyte
   transplantation can be used in clinical practice. The unique properties
   of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells
   (iPSCs) have provided an alternative approach to generating enough
   functional hepatocytes for cellular therapy. In this review, we will
   present a brief overview on the current state of hepatocyte
   differentiation from PSCs and iPSCs. Studies of liver regenerative
   processes using different cell sources (adult liver stem cells,
   hepatoblasts, hepatic progenitor cells, etc.) will be described in
   detail as well as how this knowledge can be applied towards optimizing
   culture conditions for the maintenance and differentiation of these
   cells towards hepatocytes. As the outlook of stem cell-derived therapy
   begins to look more plausible, researchers will need to address the
   challenges we must overcome in order to translate stem cell research to
   clinical applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bioencapsulation has been a promising technique for various
   biotechnological and medical applications. Nevertheless, when
   encapsulated, the activity of the encapsulated biologicals is usually
   reduced due to diffusional resistance and use of organic solvents in the
   process. Here, we developed a sal-gel electrospinning technique to
   encapsulate a bacterium, Escherichia coli expressing a biocatalyst,
   AtzA, into hybrid silica/polyvinyl alcohol nanofibers. We used a
   microfluidic timer to maintain a constant sal viscosity, thus enabling
   continuous formation of silica gel nanofibers weaving a bioreactive mat.
   Encapsulation of bacteria into thin-walled (a few tens of nanometers)
   fibers significantly reduced diffusional resistance. Furthermore, with
   this process, the need for organic solvents was eliminated. This enabled
   us to reach encapsulated bacteria activity at the levels seen in free
   cells. This novel process enables new large-scale applications in
   biotechnology, especially in bioremediation, biosensors, and
   manufacturing of recombinant proteins. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Confined synthesis of three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous-imprinted
   zeolites with tunable morphology and Si/Al ratio}},
Journal = {{MICROPOROUS AND MESOPOROUS MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{181}},
Pages = {{8-16}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Three dimensionally ordered mesoporous-imprinted (3DOm-i) zeolites with
   well-controlled mesoporosity and Si/Al ratio were synthesized within the
   confined space of three dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOm) carbon
   by conventional hydrothermal synthesis method. It was found that the
   incipient wetness technique used to prepare the 3DOm carbon can
   significantly affect the mesoporous structure of the resulting carbon
   template. 3DOm carbon with a nearly complete replication from silica
   colloidal crystals can be used to control the mesoporosity of 3DOm-i
   zeolites. Confined synthesis of hierarchical zeolites under conventional
   hydrothermal synthesis conditions offers a large variety of synthesis
   recipes for controlling the framework, morphology and composition of
   3DOm-i zeolites. It shows that a dilute initial synthesis solution
   favors the formation of single crystalline 3DOm-i silicalite-1, while a
   higher starting silica concentration results in polycrystalline 3DOm-i
   silicalite-1. The polycrystalline feature might benefit the disassembly
   of the resulting 3DOm-i zeolites for the preparation of highly
   monodisperse zeolite nanocrystals. 3DOm-i ZSM-5 with tunable acid site
   concentrations was also achieved by varying Si/Al ratios in initial
   synthesis solutions. The catalytic performance of 3DOm-i ZSM-5 was
   tested with the self-etherification of benzyl alcohol, a reaction
   severely limited by the mass transport of reactants and products in the
   micropores of ZSM-5 catalysts. It was revealed that for this reaction
   3DOm-i structure can significantly improve the reaction rate by
   alleviating diffusion limitation, and the Si/Al ratio of 3DOm-i ZSM-5
   also plays an important role in the effective utilization of the zeolite
   catalysts. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Eight beta-scission modes involving C-6 and C-8 olefin isomers are
   investigated using dispersion-corrected density functional theory (i.e.,
   PBE-D) calculations. Potential energy surfaces are evaluated within an
   acidic H-ZSM-5 supercell containing a single, isolated active site.
   Minimum energy pathways are localized using the nudged elastic band
   method. The relative enthalpic barriers of beta-scission steps can be
   described by the substitution order of the carbocationic carbon atom
   present in the reactant and transition states. Specifically, the total
   charge on the hydrocarbon fragment containing the beta C atom increases
   going from the physi- or chemisorbed reactant state to the beta-scission
   transition state; the magnitude of this change (+0.37e-0.97e) is found
   to correlate nearly monotonically with the activation energy (89-233 kJ
   mol(-1)). A comparison of 1 degrees to 3 degrees (E-1) and 3 degrees to
   1 degrees (E-2) beta-scission modes as well as 2 degrees to 3 degrees
   (B-1) and 3 degrees to 2 degrees (B-2) beta-scission modes reveals that
   the barrier heights depend on the substitution order of the beta C,
   indicating that a subcategorization of beta-scission modes is required
   based on the substitution order of the beta C atom. Isomerization
   reactions, which are fast with respect to beta-scission, enable reactant
   hydrocarbons to explore and find low-barrier beta-scission pathways.
   Selectivities predicted on the basis of the relative barrier heights of
   beta-scission modes accessible to C-6 and C-8 species indicate agreement
   with experimental observations.}},

Title = {{Role of Intracellular Stochasticity in Biofilm Growth. Insights from
   Population Balance Modeling}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 13}},
Abstract = {{There is increasing recognition that stochasticity involved in gene
   regulatory processes may help cells enhance the signal or synchronize
   expression for a group of genes. Thus the validity of the traditional
   deterministic approach to modeling the foregoing processes cannot be
   without exception. In this study, we identify a frequently encountered
   situation, i.e., the biofilm, which has in the past been persistently
   investigated with intracellular deterministic models in the literature.
   We show in this paper circumstances in which use of the intracellular
   deterministic model appears distinctly inappropriate. In Enterococcus
   faecalis, the horizontal gene transfer of plasmid spreads drug
   resistance. The induction of conjugation in planktonic and biofilm
   circumstances is examined here with stochastic as well as deterministic
   models. The stochastic model is formulated with the Chemical Master
   Equation (CME) for planktonic cells and Reaction-Diffusion Master
   Equation (RDME) for biofilm. The results show that although the
   deterministic model works well for the perfectly-mixed planktonic
   circumstance, it fails to predict the averaged behavior in the biofilm,
   a behavior that has come to be known as stochastic focusing. A notable
   finding from this work is that the interception of antagonistic feedback
   loops to signaling, accentuates stochastic focusing. Moreover,
   interestingly, increasing particle number of a control variable could
   lead to an even larger deviation. Intracellular stochasticity plays an
   important role in biofilm and we surmise by implications from the model,
   that cell populations may use it to minimize the influence from
   environmental fluctuation.}},

Abstract = {{Compared to rechargeable batteries, electrochemical double-layer
   capacitors (EDLCs) are normally considered to be higher power but lower
   electrical energy density charge storage devices. To increase the energy
   density, one can enlarge the interfacial area between electrodes and
   electrolyte through the introduction of nanopores and employ
   electrolytes that are stable over wider voltage ranges, such as ionic
   liquids. However, due to the relatively high viscosity of ionic liquids
   and large ion sizes, these measures can result in diminished power
   performance. Here, we describe the synthesis of carbon electrodes that
   overcome these limitations and simultaneously provide high specific
   energies and high specific powers in EDLCs using the ionic liquid
   EMI-TFSI as an electrolyte. A colloidal crystal templating method was
   optimized to synthesize three-dimensionally ordered mesoporous (3DOm)
   carbons with well-defined geometry, three-dimensionally interconnected
   pore structure and tunable pore size in the range from 8 to 40 nm. To
   achieve precise control over the pore sizes in the carbon products,
   parameters were established for direct syntheses or seed growth of
   monodisperse silica nanospheres with specific sizes, using
   L-lysine-assisted hydrolysis of silicon alkoxide precursors. Porous
   carbons were then templated from these materials using phenol
   formaldehyde (PF) or resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) precursors. The pore
   structures of the nanoporous carbon products were characterized in
   detail, and the materials were tested as electrodes for EDLCs. Optimal
   pore sizes were identified that provided a large interface between the
   electrode and the electrolyte while maintaining good ion transport
   through the relatively viscous electrolyte. 3DOm PF-carbons with pore
   diameters in the 21-29 nm range exhibited similar high specific
   capacitance values (146-178 F g(-1) at 0.5 A g(-1), with respect to the
   mass of carbon in a single electrode) as typical large-scale
   activated-carbon-based EDLCs but showed significantly better high-rate
   performance (80-123 F g(-1) at 25 A g(-1)), a result of the more
   accessible pore space in which ion diffusion was less restricted.}},

Title = {{Dynamics of polymer adsorption from dilute solution in shear flow near a

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{139}},
Number = {{17}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{Adsorption of polymers from dilute solution subject to shear flow near a
   planar wall is studied using kinetic theory. A dumbbell model consisting
   of two beads connected by a nonlinear spring is used to describe the
   polymer molecules, and the beads interact with the wall via a
   short-range exponential potential. Bead-bead and bead-wall hydrodynamic
   interactions are also included in the theory. For an initially bare
   surface, it is found that the quantity of polymer adsorbed decreases
   with an increase in polymer molecular weight at a given shear rate and
   point in time. In addition, for a given molecular weight and point in
   time, the quantity adsorbed decreases with an increase in shear rate.
   When adsorbed polymer is initially present, similar trends are observed.
   Furthermore, complete desorption can be achieved at a sufficiently high
   shear rate. In all cases, the time required to approach a steady value
   of the adsorbed amount is many orders of magnitude larger than the
   dumbbell relaxation time. The above findings are in qualitative
   agreement with experimental measurements reported nearly three decades
   ago by Lee and Fuller {[}J. Colloid Interface Sci. 103, 569 (1985)]. Our
   findings also suggest that the physical mechanism underlying the
   long-standing observation that shear flow inhibits polymer adsorption
   and assists polymer desorption is hydrodynamic interaction between
   stretched polymer molecules and the adsorbing surface. (C) 2013 AIP

Journal = {{ADVANCED FUNCTIONAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{41}},

Abstract = {{An experimental approach to determine the spatial extent and location of
   the exciton recombination zone in an organic light-emitting device
   (OLED) is demonstrated. This technique is applicable to a wide variety
   of OLED structures and is used to examine OLEDs which have a double-
   (D-EML), mixed- (M-EML), or graded-emissive layer (G-EML) architecture.
   The location of exciton recombination in an OLED is an important design
   parameter, as the local optical field sensed by the exciton greatly
   determines the efficiency and angular distribution of far-field light
   extraction. The spatial extent of exciton recombination is an important
   parameter that can strongly impact exciton quenching and OLED
   efficiency, particularly under high excitation. A direct measurement of
   the exciton density profile is achieved through the inclusion of a thin,
   exciton sensitizing strip in the OLED emissive layer which locally
   quenches guest excitons and whose position in the emissive layer can be
   translated across the device to probe exciton formation. In the case of
   the G-EML device architecture, an electronic model is developed to
   predict the location and extent of the exciton density profile by
   considering the drift, diffusion, and recombination of charge carriers
   within the device.}},

Volume = {{47}},
Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{12359-12365}},

Abstract = {{The effects of organic carbon concentrations and loading on the
   degradation of estrone (E1) were examined under various conditions in
   batch reactors and membrane-coupled bioreactors (MBRs). Experiments
   examined effects on individual microorganisms (substrate competition and
   growth) and on the whole community (selection). Substrate competition
   with organic carbon (competitive inhibition and catabolic repression)
   was not a factor in E1 degradation (P = 0.19 and 0.29 for two different
   analyses). Conversely, addition of organic carbon increased E1
   degradation rates, attributable to biomass growth in feast-famine
   reactors over a five-day period (P = 0.016). Subsequently, however,
   community dynamics controlled E1 degradation rates, with other organisms
   outcompeting E1 degraders. More moderate but sustained increases in E1
   degradation rates were observed under starvation conditions. Low
   influent organic carbon strength was detrimental to E1 degradation in
   MBRs, where organic carbon concentration and loading were decoupled (P =
   0.018). These results point to the importance of multiple substrate
   utilizers in E1 degradation. They also suggest that while initial growth
   of biomass depends on the presence of sufficient organic carbon, further
   enrichment under starvation conditions may improve E1 degradation
   capability via the growth and/or stimulation of multiple substrate
   utilizers rather than heterotrophs characterized by an r-strategist
   growth regime.}},

Abstract = {{In a previous article, the authors introduced a new method for the
   improved asymptotic evaluation of Laplace integrals of the type
   integral(infinity)(0) t(alpha) exp(-xt)F(t(k))dt for large x, where k
   must be 1 or 2 (Hanna and Davis, 2011). This method (called optimal
   exponential or OE) also applies to the acceleration of regular
   perturbation and power series. Here we develop a new analytical
   procedure (called expansion point or XP) to evaluate more general
   problems of the type integral(A)(0) p(t)F(t)dt. This includes the most

Abstract = {{Cultivation of microalgae to utilize CO2 and nutrients in the wastewater
   to generate biofuel products is a promising research objective. However,
   the process faces tremendous technical difficulties, especially the
   harvest of microalgae cells, an economically challenging step. Several
   researchers recently reported co-culturing of filamentous fungi with
   microalgae so that microalgae cells can be co-pelletized in order to
   facilitate the cell harvest. This algae pelletization via the
   filamentous fungi represents an innovative approach to address both the
   cost and sustainability issues in algae biofuel production and also has
   potential with direct commercial applications. This paper reviews the
   current research status in this area and some possible drawbacks of this
   method in order to provide some possible directions for the future
   research.}},

Abstract = {{The Control Volume Finite Element Method (CVFEM) combines the geometric
   flexibility of the Finite Element Method (FEM) with the physical
   intuition of the Control Volume Method (CVM). These two features of the
   CVFEM make it a very powerful tool for solving heat and fluid flow
   problems within complex domain geometries. In solving problems in the
   two-dimensional domains the development of the CVFEM has been well
   documented. For the three-dimensional problems, while there is extensive
   reporting on the details of the numerical approximation, there is
   relatively sparse information on important issues related to data
   structure and interpolation. Here, in the context of a general 3D
   advection-diffusion problem, a step-by-step derivation of the CVFEM is
   provided. Significant emphasis is placed on clearly defining an
   appropriate geometric data structure and detailing the key elements
   required to arrive at the final discrete equation. The performance and
   operation of the resulting 3D CVFEM scheme is highlighted by comparing
   its predictions against existing analytical solutions.}},

Title = {{A hybrid subgrid-scale model constrained by Reynolds stress}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A novel constrained formulation for the dynamic subgrid-scale model for
   large eddy simulation (LES) is proposed. An externally prescribed
   Reynolds stress is used as the constraint and is imposed in the
   near-wall region of wall-bounded flows. However, unlike conventional
   zonal approaches, Reynolds stress is not imposed as the solution, but
   used as a constraint on the subgrid-scale stress so that the computed
   Reynolds stress closely matches the prescribed one only in the mean
   sense. In the absence of an ideal wall model or adequate near-wall
   resolution, a LES solution at coarse resolution is expected to be
   erroneous very near the wall while giving reasonable predictions away
   from the wall. The Reynolds stress constraint is limited to the region
   where the LES solution is expected to be erroneous. The Germano-identity
   error is used as an indicator of LES quality such that the Reynolds
   stress constraint is activated only where the Germano-identity error
   exceeds a certain threshold. The proposed model is applied to LES of
   turbulent channel flow at various Reynolds numbers and grid resolutions
   to obtain significant improvement over the dynamic Smagorinsky model,
   especially at coarse resolutions. This constrained formulation can be
   extended to incorporate constraints on the mean of other flow
   quantities. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{1360-1382}},

Abstract = {{The hub-and-spoke distribution paradigm has been a fundamental principle
   in geographic network design for more than 40 years. One of the primary
   advantages that such networks possess is their ability to exploit
   economies of scale in transportation by aggregating network flows
   through common sources. In this paper, we consider the problem of
   designing an optimal hub-and-spoke network in continuous Euclidean
   space: the ``spokes{''} of the network are distributed uniformly over a
   service region, and our objective is to determine the optimal number of
   hub nodes and their locations. We consider seven different backbone
   network topologies for connecting the hub nodes, namely, the Steiner and
   minimum spanning trees, a travelling salesman tour, a star network, a
   capacitated vehicle routing tour, a complete bipartite graph, and a
   complete graph. We also perform an additional analysis on a multilevel
   network in which network flows move through multiple levels of
   transshipment before reaching the service region. We describe the
   asymptotically optimal (or near-optimal) configurations that minimize
   the total network costs as the demand in the region becomes large and
   give an approximation algorithm that solves our problem on a convex
   planar region for any values of the relevant input parameters.}},

   coating with silica nanoparticles}},
Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{249}},
Pages = {{290-296}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Using a representative powder blend containing ibuprofen, the
   applicability of coating with silica nanoparticles using a dry comilling
   process to effectively enhance flowability of formulated pharmaceutical
   powders was investigated. Using a shear cell, we systematically studied
   effects of process parameters, including the total number of cotnilling
   cycles, silica loading level, type of screen (mesh size), impeller
   speed, and impeller type, on the efficiency of the nanocoating process.
   Impact of silica coating on powder tabletability was also assessed using
   a compaction simulator. Results confirm that coating with silica nano
   particles significantly improves flowability of the formulated ibuprofen
   blend. The two most prominent factors that lead to flowability
   improvement are 1) repeated comilling cycles and 2) higher silica
   loading. In addition, we have observed that simple blending is effective
   in coating silica nanoparticles to improve flowability of the formulated
   ibuprofen powders, which is not very cohesive. This suggests the
   possibility of improving flowability of a sub-optimum formulation by
   prolonging the blending process in presence of colloidal silica.
   Moreover, silica coated ibuprofen blend exhibits improved tabletability
   and compactibility without significantly impacting compressibility. The
   simultaneous improvement in powder tabletability and flowability shows
   the potential of the nanocoating strategy in improving tablet
   manufacturability of pharmaceutical powders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Journal = {{IEEE SIGNAL PROCESSING MAGAZINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{30}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{64-73}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Recent research and experimental findings, as well as technological
   development and commercialization efforts, suggest that even a modest
   amount of data can deliver superior signal modeling and reconstruction
   performance if sparsity is present and accounted for. Early
   sparsity-aware signal processing techniques have mostly targeted
   stationary signal analysis using offline algorithms for signal and image
   reconstruction from Fourier samples. On the other hand, sparsity-aware
   time-frequency tools for nonstationary signal analysis have recently
   received growing attention. In this context, sparse regression has
   offered a new paradigm for instantaneous frequency estimation, over
   classical time-frequency representations. Standard techniques for
   estimating model parameters from time series yield erroneous fits when,
   e. g., abrupt changes or outliers cause model mismatches. Accordingly,
   the need arises for basic research in robust processing of nonstationary
   parametric models that leverage sparsity to accomplish tasks such as
   tracking of signal variations, outlier rejection, robust parameter
   estimation, and change detection. This article aims at delineating the
   analytical background of sparsity-aware time-series analysis and
   introducing sparsity-aware robust and nonstationary parametric models to
   the signal processing readership, through readily appreciated
   applications in frequency-hopping (FH) communications and speech
   compression. Preliminary results strongly support the vision of seeking
   the ``right{''} form of sparsity for the ``right{''} application to
   enable sparsity-cognizant estimation of robust parametric models for
   nonstationary signal analysis.}},

Abstract = {{As an important technical innovation which has emerged in the automotive
   industry, powertrain hybridization has been considered as one of the
   most effective ways for addressing transportation energy consumption and
   environmental concerns. However, owing to the complex physical and
   chemical nature of the engine combustion process, and the dynamic
   interactions between the engine and the alternative power source, it is
   difficult to optimize simultaneously and precisely both the engine fuel
   consumption and the emissions, especially during transient operations.
   Targeted at achieving both global energy optimization and reduction in
   the transient emissions, a control-oriented diesel engine emission model
   is first investigated and identified using a large number of
   experimental data. On this basis, a two-mode hybrid energy management
   strategy is proposed. In the fuel-efficiency-improving' mode, a dynamic
   programming algorithm is used to seek global optimization of the fuel
   economy and to ensure sustainability of the battery's state of charge
   over any given driving cycle while, in the emission-reducing' mode, the
   management strategy utilizes a linear quadratic regulator to optimize
   locally the surging emissions due to undesired engine torque transients.
   At the end of each emission-reducing mode, the locally optimized engine
   operation is driven back to match the globally optimized trajectory,
   i.e. the initial states of the next fuel-efficiency-improving mode. This
   seamless integration of the two modes will realize a reduction in the
   local transient emissions without losing optimality of the global fuel
   efficiency and sustainability of the battery's state of charge.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed modeling and control
   strategy can considerably reduce the local soot emissions of a
   power-split diesel hybrid electric vehicle but can still maintain a high
   fuel efficiency and a high state of charge of the battery.}},

Abstract = {{Biopharmaceuticals derived from enveloped virus comprise an expanding
   market of vaccines, oncolytic vectors and gene therapy products. Thus,
   increased attention is given to the development of robust high titer
   cell hosts for their manufacture. However, the knowledge on the
   physiological constraints modulating virus production is still scarce
   and the use of integrated strategies to improve hosts productivity and
   upstream bioprocess an under explored territory.
   In this work, we conducted a functional genomics study, including the
   transcriptional profiling and central carbon metabolism analysis,
   following the metabolic changes in the transition `parental-to-producer'
   of two human cell lines producing recombinant retrovirus. Results were
   gathered into three comprehensive metabolic maps, providing a broad and
   integrated overview of gene expression changes for both cell lines.
   Eight pathways were identified to be recruited in the virus production
   state: amino acid catabolism, carbohydrate catabolism and integration of
   the energy metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, glutathione metabolism,
   pentose phosphate pathway, polyamines biosynthesis and lipid metabolism.
   Their ability to modulate viral titers was experimentally challenged,
   leading to improved specific productivities of recombinant retrovirus up
   to 6-fold. Within recruited pathways in the virus production state, we
   sought for metabolic engineering gene targets in the low producing
   phenotypes. A mining strategy was used alternative to the traditional
   approach `high vs low producer' clonal comparison. Instead, `high vs.
   low producer' from different genetic backgrounds (i.e. cell origins)
   were compared. Several genes were identified as limiting in the
   low-production phenotype, including two enzymes from cholesterol
   biosynthesis, two enzymes from glutathione biosynthesis and the
   regulatory machinery of polyamines biosynthesis. This is thus a frontier
   work, bridging fundamentals to technological research and contributing
   to enlarge our understanding of enveloped virus production dynamics in
   mammalian cell hosts. (C) 2013 International Metabolic Engineering

Abstract = {{Recombinant mammalian cells are the major hosts for the production of
   protein therapeutics. In addition to high expression of the product
   gene, a hyper-producer must also harbor superior phenotypic traits
   related to metabolism, protein secretion, and growth control.
   Introduction of genes endowing the relevant hyper-productivity traits is
   a strategy frequently used to enhance the productivity. Most of such
   cell engineering efforts have been performed using constitutive
   expression systems. However, cells respond to various environmental cues
   and cellular events dynamically according to cellular needs. The use of
   inducible systems allows for time dependent expression, but requires
   external manipulation. Ideally, a transgene's expression should be
   synchronous to the host cell's own rhythm, and at levels appropriate for
   the objective. To that end, we identified genes with different
   expression dynamics and intensity ranges using pooled transcriptome
   data. Their promoters may be used to drive the expression of the
   transgenes following the desired dynamics. We isolated the promoter of
   the Thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) gene and demonstrated its
   capability to drive transgene expression in concert with cell growth. We
   further employed this Chinese hamster promoter to engineer dynamic
   expression of the mouse GLUTS fructose transporter in Chinese hamster
   ovary (CHO) cells, enabling them to utilize sugar according to cellular
   needs rather than in excess as typically seen in culture. Thus, less
   lactate was produced, resulting in a better growth rate, prolonged
   culture duration, and higher product titer. This approach illustrates a
   novel concept in metabolic engineering which can potentially be used to
   achieve dynamic control of cellular behaviors for enhanced process
   characteristics. (C) 2013 International Metabolic Engineering Society.

Abstract = {{Boundedly rational user equilibria (BRUE) represent traffic flow
   distribution patterns where travellers can take any route whose travel
   cost is within an `indifference band' of the shortest path cost. Those
   traffic flow patterns satisfying the above condition constitute a set,
   named the BRUE solution set. It is important to obtain all the BRUE flow
   patterns, because it can help predict the variation of the link flow
   pattern in a traffic network under the boundedly rational behavior
   assumption. However, the methodology of constructing the BRUE set has
   been lacking in the established literature. This paper fills the gap by
   constructing the BRUE solution set on traffic networks with fixed
   demands. After defining epsilon-BRUE, where a is the indifference band
   for the perceived travel cost, we formulate the epsilon-BRUE problem as
   a nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP), so that a BRUE solution can
   be obtained by solving a BRUE-NCP formulation. To obtain the BRUE
   solution set encompassing all BRUE flow patterns, we propose a
   methodology of generating acceptable path set which may be utilized
   under the boundedly rational behavior assumption. We show that with the
   increase of the indifference band, the acceptable path set that contains
   boundedly rational equilibrium flows will be augmented, and the critical
   values of indifference band to augment these path sets can be identified
   by solving a family of mathematical programs with equilibrium
   constraints (MPEC) sequentially. The BRUE solution set can then be
   obtained by assigning all traffic demands to the acceptable path set.
   Various numerical examples are given to illustrate our findings. (C)

Abstract = {{Two high-chi block copolymers, lamella-forming
   poly(styrene-block-{[}isoprene-random-epoxyisoprene]) (PS-PEI78, with 78
   mol \% epoxidation) and lamella-forming
   poly(4-trimethylsilylstyrene-block-D,L-lactide) (PTMSS-PLA), were used
   to study three combinations of interfacial neutrality involving at least
   one neutral interface. PS-PEI78 annealed on a nonpreferential polymer
   mat (SMG) produced perpendicular lamellae independent of film thickness,
   indicating a neutral substrate and neutral free surface. In contrast,
   the presence of only one neutral interface results in the formation of
   surface topography ({''}islands{''} and ``holes{''}) with 0.5L(0) step
   heights. PS-PEI78 (neutral free surface) annealed on PS brush (PS block
   preferential) forms ``half' islands and holes. The inverse experiment,
   PTMSS-PLA (with a PTMSS preferential free surface) annealed on a neutral
   (or near neutral) substrate surface, also generates 0.5L(0) topography.
   These ``half' island and hole structures are stable to extended thermal
   annealing. PS-PEI78 exposes both blocks at the free surface in contrast
   to PTMSS-PLA, which exposes just one. All three combinations of
   interfacial neutrality are explained by the precise balancing of the
   wetting tendencies of the two blocks. Evolution of the 0.5L(0) motifs
   appears to be facilitated by a preference to form half-period thick
   nuclei in the initial stages of morphological development.}},

Abstract = {{We have examined the significant enhancement of ambipolar charge
   injection and transport properties of bottom-contact single crystal
   field-effect transistors (SC-FETs) based on a new rubrene derivative,
   bis(trifluoromethyl)-dimethyl-rubrene (fm-rubrene), by employing carbon
   nanotube ((NT) electrodes. The fundamental challenge associated with
   fm-rubrene crystals is their deep-lying HOMO and LUMO energy levels,
   resulting in inefficient hole injection and suboptimal electron
   injection from conventional Au electrodes due to large Schottky
   barriers. Applying thin layers of CNT network at the charge injection
   interface of fm-rubrene crystals substantially reduces the contact
   resistance for both holes and electrons; consequently, benchmark
   ambipolar mobilities have been achieved, reaching 4.8 cm(2) V-1 s(-1)
   for hole transport and 4.2 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) for electron transport. We
   find that such improved injection efficiency in fm-rubrene is beneficial
   for ultimately unveiling its intrinsic charge transport properties so as
   to exceed those of its parent molecule, rubrene, in the current device
   architecture. Our studies suggest that CNT electrodes may provide a
   universal approach to ameliorate the charge injection obstacles in
   organic electronic devices regardless of charge carrier type, likely due
   to the electric field enhancement along the nanotube located at the
   crystal/electrode interface.}},

Abstract = {{Significant progress to address the effect of load application time and
   temperature on the fracture energy of asphalt mixtures was made in a
   comprehensive research effort as part of two national pooled-fund
   studies addressing low-temperature cracking in the US. Two fracture
   methods were thoroughly investigated and were proposed for
   standardization: the Disc-Shaped Compact Tension DC(T) test and the Semi
   Circular Bending (SCB) test. Recently, a simpler test that combines the
   advantages of both DC(T) and SCB configurations has been developed and
   successfully used in Spain, the Fenix test. This paper presents the
   results from the application of SCB and Fenix tests in the assessment of
   fracture behavior of different types of mixtures and the effect of both
   loading rate and temperature on the results obtained. The main
   conclusion is that both SCB and Fenix tests give similar information
   when comparing two types of mixtures or selecting mixtures resistant
   tocracking. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{36}},
Pages = {{196-211}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Under oversaturated traffic conditions, signal timings need to be
   adjusted accordingly in order to alleviate the detrimental impacts
   caused by oversaturation. In this research, our focus is to mitigate two
   types of detrimental effects, signal phase failure with residual queue
   and downstream queue spillover. Building upon our previous work on the
   oversaturation severity indices, a maximum-flow based approach to manage
   oversaturated intersections is developed. The proposed model maximizes
   the discharging capacity along oversaturated routes, while satisfying
   the constraints on available green times. We show that a simple
   Forward-Backward Procedure (FBP) can be used to obtain the optimal
   solution to the maximum flow model. The forward process aims to increase
   green time to mitigate oversaturation, therefore improve the throughput
   for the oversaturated approach; and the backward process aims to gate
   the traffic at some intersections to prevent residual queues and
   downstream queue spill-back when the available green time is
   insufficient. The algorithm is tested using a microscopic traffic
   simulation model for an arterial network in the City of Pasadena, CA.
   The results indicate the model can effectively and efficiently reduce
   oversaturation and improve system performance.}},

Abstract = {{The biosynthesis of wax esters in bacteria is accomplished by a unique
   pathway that combines a fatty alcohol and a fatty acyl coenzyme A
   substrate. Previous in vitro enzymatic studies indicated that two
   different enzymes could be involved in the synthesis of the required
   fatty alcohol in Marinobacter aquaeolei VT8. In this study, we
   demonstrate through a series of gene deletions and transcriptional
   analysis that either enzyme is capable of fulfilling the role of
   providing the fatty alcohol required for wax ester biosynthesis in vivo,
   but evolution has clearly selected one of these, a previously
   characterized fatty aldehyde reductase, as the preferred enzyme to
   perform this reaction under typical wax ester-accumulating conditions.
   These results complement previous in vitro studies and provide the first
   glimpse into the role of each enzyme in vivo in the native organism.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we demonstrate that rigorous high-order perturbation of
   surfaces (HOPS) methods coupled with analytic continuation mechanisms
   are particularly well-suited for the assessment and design of nanoscale
   devices (e.g., biosensors) that operate based on surface plasmon
   resonances generated through the interaction of light with a periodic
   (metallic) grating. In this connection we explain that the
   characteristics of the latter are perfectly aligned with the optimal
   domain of applicability of HOPS schemes, as these procedures can be
   shown to be the methods of choice for low to moderate wavelengths of
   radiation and grating roughness that is representable by a few (e.g.,
   tens of) Fourier coefficients. We argue that, in this context, the
   method can, for instance, produce full and precise reflectivity maps in
   computational times that are orders of magnitude faster than those of
   alternative numerical schemes (e.g., the popular ``C-method,{''} finite
   differences, integral equations or finite elements). In this initial
   study we concentrate on the description of the basic principles that
   underlie the solution scheme, including those that relate to analytic
   continuation procedures. Within this framework, we explain how, in spite
   of conventional wisdom to the contrary, the resulting perturbative
   techniques can provide a most valuable tool for practical investigations
   in plasmonics. We demonstrate this with some examples that have been
   previously discussed in the literature (including treatments of the
   reflectivity and band gap structure of some simple geometries) and
   extend this to demonstrate the wider applicability of the proposed
   approach. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a novel scheme for plasmonic nanofocusing with internally
   illuminated asymmetric metallic pyramidal tips using linearly polarized
   light. A wafer-scale array of sharp metallic pyramids is fabricated via
   template stripping with films of different thicknesses on opposing
   pyramid facets. This structural asymmetry is achieved through a one-step
   angled metal deposition that does not require any additional lithography
   processing and when internally illuminated enables the generation of
   plasmons using a Kretschmann-like coupling method on only one side of
   the pyramids. Plasmons traveling toward the tip on one side will
   converge at the apex, forming a nanoscale ``hotspot.{''} The asymmetry
   is necessary for these focusing effects since symmetric pyramids display
   destructive plasmon interference at the tip. Computer simulations
   confirm that internal illumination with linearly polarized light at
   normal incidence on these asymmetric pyramids will focus optical energy
   into nanoscale volumes. Far-field optical experiments demonstrate large
   field enhancements as well as angle-dependent spectral tuning of the
   reradiated light. Because of the low background light levels,
   wafer-scale fabrication, and a straightforward excitation scheme, these
   asymmetric pyramidal tips will find applications in near-field optical
   microscopy and array-based optical trapping.}},

Abstract = {{We present results of tests with recombinant Lactococcus lactis that
   produce and secrete heterologous antimicrobial peptides with activity
   against Gram-negative pathogenic Escherichia coli and Salmonella. In an
   initial screening, the activities of numerous candidate antimicrobial
   peptides, made by solid state synthesis, were assessed against several
   indicator pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella strains. Peptides A3APO and
   Alyteserin were selected as top performers based on high antimicrobial
   activity against the pathogens tested and on significantly lower
   antimicrobial activity against L. lactis. Expression cassettes
   containing the signal peptide of the protein Usp45 fused to the
   codon-optimized sequence of mature A3APO and Alyteserin were cloned
   under the control of a nisin-inducible promoter PnisA and transformed
   into L. lactis IL1403. The resulting recombinant strains were induced to
   express and secrete both peptides. A3APO- and Alyteserin-containing
   supernatants from these recombinant L. lactis inhibited the growth of
   pathogenic E. coli and Salmonella by up to 20-fold, while maintaining
   the host's viability. This system may serve as a model for the
   production and delivery of antimicrobial peptides by lactic acid
   bacteria to target Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria populations.}},

Volume = {{184}},

Abstract = {{The DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3G (A3G) is a two-domain protein that
   binds single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) largely through its N-terminal domain
   and catalyzes deamination using its C-terminal domain. A3G is considered
   an innate immune effector protein, with a natural capacity to block the
   replication of retroviruses such as HIV and retrotransposons. However,
   knowledge about its biophysical properties and mechanism of interaction
   with DNA are still limited. Oligomerization is one of these unclear
   issues. What is the stoichiometry of the free protein? What are the
   factors defining the oligomeric state of the protein? How does the
   protein oligomerization change upon DNA binding? How stable are protein
   oligomers? We address these questions here using atomic force microscopy
   (AFM) to directly image A3G protein in a free-state and in complexes
   with DNA, and using time-lapse AFM imaging to characterize the dynamics
   of A3G oligomers. We found that the formation of oligomers is an
   inherent property of A3G and that the yield of oligomers depends on the
   protein concentration. Oligomerization of A3G in complexes with ssDNA
   follows a similar pattern: the higher the protein concentrations the
   larger oligomers sizes. The specificity of A3G binding to ssDNA does not
   depend on stoichiometry. The binding of large MG oligomers requires a
   longer ssDNA substrate; therefore, much smaller oligomers form complexes
   with short ssDNA. A3G oligomers dissociate spontaneously into monomers
   and this process primarily occurs through a monomer dissociation
   pathway. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The laser-damage thresholds of single material and nanolaminate thin
   films were compared under continuous-wave (CW) illumination conditions.
   Nanolaminate films consist of uniform material interrupted by the
   periodic insertion of one or more atomic layers of an alternative
   material. Hafnia and titania were used as the base materials, and the
   films were deposited using atomic-layer deposition. The nanolaminates
   were less polycrystalline than the uniform films, as quantified using
   x-ray diffraction. It was found that the nanolaminate films had reduced
   laser-damage thresholds on smooth and patterned substrates as compared
   to uniform single-material films. This behavior is unusual as prior art
   indicates that amorphous (less polycrystalline) materials have higher
   laser-damage thresholds under short-pulse excitation. It is speculated
   that this may indicate that local thermal conduction affects breakdown
   more strongly under CW excitation than the dielectric properties that
   are important for short-pulse excitation. (C) 2013 Optical Society of

Abstract = {{This paper describes the design and performance analysis of a control
   system for rotorcraft with an emphasis on the requirements called for by
   autonomous guidance. To be able to track trajectories, such as those
   generated by a guidance system, a path following controller is used in
   combination with a velocity control augmentation. The path following
   system is motivated by nonlinear stability analysis. The velocity
   control augmentation follows a loop-shaping design for the inner-loop
   attitude control and a dynamic inversion velocity control design for the
   outer-loop. The identified model of the dynamics along with the
   uncertainties is used to determine the robustness and performance of the
   velocity control system. Finally, the paper presents a novel method to
   evaluate the overall performance of the control system in terms of the
   tracking error statistics. These results are then used to determine a
   tracking error model, which can be used to predict the tracking error
   for a given reference. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) is a process that, through rapid mixing,
   stabilizes an insoluble low molecular weight compound in a nanosized,
   polymer-stabilized delivery vehicle. The polymeric components are
   typically amphiphilic diblock copolymers (BCPs). In order to fully
   exploit the potential of FNP, factors affecting particle structure,
   size, and stability must be understood. Here we show that polymer type,
   hydrophobicity and crystallinity of the small molecule, and small
   molecule loading levels all affect particle size and stability. Of the
   four block copolymers (BCP) that we have studied here, poly(ethylene
   glycol)-b-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PEG-b-PLGA) was most suitable
   for potential drug delivery applications due to its ability to give rise
   to stable nanoparticles, its biocompatibility, and its degradability. We
   found little difference in particle size when using PLGA block sizes
   over the range of 5 to 15 IcDa. The choice of hydrophobic small molecule
   was important, as molecules with a calculated water-octanol partition
   coefficient (clogP) below 6 gave rise to particles that were unstable
   and underwent rapid Ostwald ripening. Studies probing the internal
   structure of nanoparticles were also performed. Analysis of differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy
   (cryo-TEM), and H-1 NMR experiments support a three-layer
   core-shell-corona nanoparticle structure.}},

Abstract = {{In rodent model systems, the sequential changes in lung morphology
   resulting from hyperoxic injury are well characterized and are similar
   to changes in human acute respiratory distress syndrome. In the injured
   lung, alveolar type two (AT2) epithelial cells play a critical role in
   restoring the normal alveolar structure. Thus characterizing the changes
   in AT2 cells will provide insights into the mechanisms underpinning the
   recovery from lung injury. We applied an unbiased systems-level
   proteomics approach to elucidate molecular mechanisms contributing to
   lung repair in a rat hyperoxic lung injury model. AT2 cells were
   isolated from rat lungs at predetermined intervals during hyperoxic
   injury and recovery. Protein expression profiles were determined by
   using iTRAQ with tandem mass spectrometry. Of the 959 distinct proteins
   identified, 183 significantly changed in abundance during the
   injury-recovery cycle. Gene ontology enrichment analysis identified cell
   cycle, cell differentiation, cell metabolism, ion homeostasis,
   programmed cell death, ubiquitination, and cell migration to be
   significantly enriched by these proteins. Gene set enrichment analysis
   of data acquired during lung repair revealed differential expression of
   gene sets that control multicellular organismal development, systems
   development, organ development, and chemical homeostasis. More detailed
   analysis identified activity in two regulatory pathways, JNK and miR
   374. A novel short time-series expression miner algorithm identified
   protein clusters with coherent changes during injury and repair. We
   concluded that coherent changes occur in the AT2 cell proteome in
   response to hyperoxic stress. These findings offer guidance regarding
   the specific molecular mechanisms governing repair of the injured lung.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new boundary element-based approach for solving
   three-dimensional problems of an elastic medium containing multiple
   cracks of arbitrary shapes. The medium could be loaded by far-field
   stress (for infinite domains), surface tractions (including those at the
   cracks surfaces), or point loads. Constant body forces are also allowed.
   The elastic fields outside of the cracks are represented by integral
   identities. Triangular elements are employed to discretize the
   boundaries. Integration over each element is performed analytically.
   In-plane components of the fields are combined in various complex
   combinations to simplify the integration. No singular integrals are
   involved since the limit, as the field point approaches the boundary, is
   taken after the integration. The collocation method is used to set up
   the system of linear algebraic equations to find the unknown boundary
   displacements and tractions. No special procedure is required to
   evaluate the fields outside of the boundaries, as the integration is
   performed before the limit is taken. Several numerical examples are
   presented to demonstrate the capacity of the method. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Spatiotemporal Evolution and Prediction of {[}Ca2+](i) and APD Alternans

Abstract = {{Prediction of Alternans in the Heart
   IntroductionAction potential duration (APD) alternans can be accompanied
   by alternans in intracellular calcium transients ({[}Ca2+](i)), leading
   to electromechanical alternans. Electromechanical alternans is
   considered a substrate for ventricular fibrillation. Although some
   techniques have been developed to predict APD alternans, the onset of
   {[}Ca2+](i) alternans has never been predicted.
   Methods and ResultsSimultaneous mapping of voltage and calcium was
   performed in 8 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts. APD, {[}Ca2+](i)
   amplitude (CaA) and duration (CaD) alternans were induced using a
   perturbed downsweep protocol. Local onset of alternans (B-onset) was
   defined as the cycle length (BCL) at which at least 10\% of the RV
   exhibited alternans. We observed that the local onset of CaA alternans
   always occurred first, followed by APD and then CaD alternans. We
   constructed APD, CaD, and CaA restitution portraits for 2 regions of the
   heart defined at B-onset: the 1:1(alt) region, which developed
   alternans, and the 1:1 region, which did not. Our results also show that
   the slopes <mml:msubsup>S12 Max </mml:msubsup> and S-Dyn were higher in
   1:1(alt) region (S-Dyn= 0.99 0.04 vs 0.73 +/- 0.06; <mml:msubsup>S12 Max
   </mml:msubsup>= 0.95 +/- 0.13 vs 0.65 +/- 0.1, P < 0.05) prior to onset
   of CaD alternans, while S-12 and <mml:msubsup>S12 Max </mml:msubsup>
   were significantly higher in the 1:1(alt) region (S-12= 0.59 +/- 0.19 vs
   0.19 +/- 0.02; <mml:msubsup>S12 Max </mml:msubsup>= 1.09 +/- 0.1 vs 0.61
   +/- 0.08, P < 0.05) prior to onset of CaA alternans.
   ConclusionWe successfully applied the restitution portrait technique to
   the prediction of {[}Ca2+](i) (both CaA and CaD) alternans. The slopes
   of the APD/CaD/CaA restitution portrait are definitive indicators of
   APD, CaD, and CaA alternans.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{A variable displacement hydraulic pump/motor with high efficiency at all
   operating conditions, including low displacement, is beneficial to
   multiple applications. Two major energy loss terms in conventional pumps
   are the friction and lubrication leakage in the kinematic joints. This
   paper presents the synthesis, analysis, and experimental validation of a
   variable displacement sixbar crank-rocker-slider mechanism that uses low
   friction pin joints instead of planar joints as seen in conventional
   variable pump/motor architectures. The novel linkage reaches true zero
   displacement with a constant top dead center position, further
   minimizing compressibility energy losses. The synthesis technique
   develops the range of motion for the base fourbar crank-rocker and
   creates a method of synthesizing the output slider dyad. It is shown
   that the mechanism can be optimized for minimum footprint and maximum
   stroke with a minimum base fourbar transmission angle of 30 deg and a
   resultant slider transmission angle of 52 deg. The synthesized linkage
   has a dimensionless stroke of 2.1 crank lengths with a variable timing
   ratio and velocity and acceleration profiles in the same order of
   magnitude as a comparable crank-slider mechanism. The kinematic and
   kinetic results from an experimental prototype linkage agree well with
   the model predictions.}},

Title = {{Lattice-Based n-Point Time-Sequential Sampling and Two-Stage Process
   Control for Maintaining Tone Consistency of Xerographic Processes}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{21}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{2024-2037}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper proposes: 1) a lattice based time-sequential sampling
   approach that requires the printing and measuring of the smallest number
   of tonal samples to characterize the high-dimensional tone reproduction
   curve (TRC) at each print cycle, and 2) based on this characterization,
   the design of a two-stage control strategy to maintain tone consistency
   of a xerographic printing process. The printer's TRC maps the desired
   tones to the actual printed tones and it is high dimensional due to the
   large number of desired tones. To avoid using many sensors, the
   measurement of the TRC is achieved by sampling it time-sequentially and
   by reconstructing the TRC from the samples via a Kalman filter. In
   time-sequential sampling, only a few distinct n tones are printed and
   measured at each print cycle. Using a lattice-theoretic framework, an
   optimal time-sequential sampling sequence with n = 1 is designed. This
   is then extended to the case of n > 1 to enable the tradeoff between
   sampling time and sampling resources. With the reconstructed
   time-varying TRC, a two-stage control strategy uses both the physical
   xerographic and the image processing processes to compensate for the TRC
   variations from the desired TRC. Simulations and experiments show that
   the proposed TRC stabilization system is effective for practical
   implementation. By stabilizing all the cyan, magenta and yellow
   primaries of the color xerographic print system, color consistency can
   be maintained. Furthermore, the proposed time-sequential sampling
   approach with n = 1 exceeds the capability of conventional
   three-fixed-point sampling (light, middle, and dark tones) approach
   while requiring three times fewer samples.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a cognitive approach to design phase-only
   modulated waveforms sharing a desired range-Doppler response. The idea
   is to minimize the average value of the ambiguity function of the
   transmitted signal over some range-Doppler bins, which are identified
   exploiting a plurality of knowledge sources. From a technical point of
   view, this is tantamount to optimizing a real and homogeneous complex
   quartic order polynomial with a constant modulus constraint on each
   optimization variable. After proving some interesting properties of the
   considered problem, we devise a polynomial-time waveform optimization
   procedure based on the Maximum Block Improvement (MBI) method and the
   theory of conjugate-partial-symmetric/conjugate-super-symmetric fourth
   order tensors. At the analysis stage, we assess the performance of the
   proposed technique showing its capability to properly shape the
   range-Doppler response of the transmitted waveform.}},

Abstract = {{A new concept for long-term solar thermal storage is based on the
   absorption properties of aqueous calcium chloride. Water, diluted and
   concentrated calcium chloride solutions are stored in a single tank. An
   immersed heat exchanger and stratification manifold are used to preserve
   long-term sorption storage, and to achieve thermal stratification. The
   feasibility of sensible heating the tank via large-scale natural
   convection without mixing salt solutions is demonstrated via
   measurements of velocity, CaCl2 mass fraction, and temperature in a 1500
   l prototype tank. Experiments are conducted over a practical range of
   the relevant dimensionless parameters. For Rayleigh numbers from 3.4 x
   10(8) to 5.6 x 10(10) and buoyancy ratios from 0.8 to 46.2, measured
   Sherwood numbers are 11 +/- 2 to 62 +/- 9, and the tank is thermally
   stratified. Convective mixing between salt layers is inhibited by the
   presence of a steep density gradient at the interface between regions of
   differing mass fraction. The predicted storage time scales based on
   mixing via natural convection for the reported Sherwood numbers are
   160-902 days.}},

Abstract = {{This study was designed to characterize the dynamic formation of zeolite
   synthesized from fly ash (ZFA) and to identify the zeolitization
   mechanisms during a 160-h-long hydrothermal alkaline conversion at 95
   degrees C by using fly ash (FA) samples collected from four typical
   thermoelectric power plants in China, with the purpose of improving ZFA
   quality. The process of synthesizing ZFA can be fundamentally divided
   into five stages: induction stage (0-0.5 h), accelerating dissolution
   stage (0.5-12 h), nucleation and/or crystallization stage (12-24 h),
   crystal growth stage (24-72 h) and crystal transformation stage (72-160
   h). The crystal growth stage determined the quality of zeolite
   crystallization, coupled with functions of re-assembling the
   silicon-aluminium tetrahedral network and developing submicro- and/or
   nanometer microstructure. A 48-h-long hydrothermal conversion generated
   ZFAs that had a greater specific surface area (26.0-89.4 times) and
   cation exchange capacity (29.6-71.0 times) than FA, which successfully
   sequestrated 41-95\% of ammonium and 75-98\% of phosphate from swine
   manure. However, over-reaction resulted in more stable hydroxysodalite
   and/or sodalite, surface agglomeration and cracking, and energy wasting.
   This work suggests that the reuse of recycled synthesis materials should
   occur during the fourth step (24-72 h).}},

Abstract = {{Given a limited number of entries from the superposition of a
   low-rankmatrix plus the product of a known compression matrix times a
   sparse matrix, recovery of the low-rank and sparse components is a
   fundamental task subsuming compressed sensing, matrix completion, and
   principal components pursuit. This paper develops algorithms for
   decentralized sparsity-regularized rank minimization over networks, when
   the nuclear-and l(1)-norm are used as surrogates to the rank and nonzero
   entry counts of the sought matrices, respectively. While nuclear-norm
   minimization has well-documented merits when centralized processing is
   viable, non-separability of the singular-value sum challenges its
   decentralized minimization. To overcome this limitation, leveraging an
   alternative characterization of the nuclear norm yields a separable, yet
   non-convex cost minimized via the alternating-direction method of
   multipliers. Interestingly, if the decentralized (non-convex) estimator
   converges, under certain conditions it provably attains the global
   optimum of its centralized counterpart. As a result, this paper bridges
   the performance gap between centralized and in-network decentralized,
   sparsity-regularized rank minimization. This, in turn, facilitates
   (stable) recovery of the low rank and sparse model matrices through
   reduced-complexity per-node computations, and affordable message passing
   among single-hop neighbors. Several application domains are outlined to
   highlight the generality and impact of the proposed framework. These
   include unveiling traffic anomalies in backbone networks, and predicting
   networkwide path latencies. Simulations with synthetic and real network
   data confirm the convergence of the novel decentralized algorithm, and
   its centralized performance guarantees.}},

Abstract = {{Marsupial robot teams offer the ability to augment or replace
   human-based responses to hazardous scenarios such as search-and-rescue

   of a novel marsupial system where a multi-level hierarchy allows larger
   robots to transport, deploy, coordinate, recover, and resupply large
   numbers of smaller deployable systems is outlined. The design and
   implementation of hardware systems for performing these actions is

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method to indirectly determine the probability
   distribution function of strength of quasibrittle structures. The method
   is derived within the framework of the finite weakest link model, which
   indicates that the size dependence of the mean structural strength can
   be calculated from the size effect on the probability distribution of
   the structural strength. By considering the inversion of this model, we
   show that the cumulative distribution function of structural strength
   can be explicitly determined from the parameters of the mean size effect
   curve. The proposed method is verified by a comprehensive set of
   experiments on asphalt mixture at a low temperature, which involves
   tests on both the strength histograms and the mean size effect. In the
   meantime, the agreement between the predicted and experimentally
   measured strength histograms of asphalt mixture specimens of different
   sizes further confirms the validity of the finite weakest link model.

Abstract = {{The development of improved methods for early detection and
   characterization of cancer presents a major clinical challenge. One
   approach that has shown excellent potential in preclinical and clinical
   evaluation is molecular imaging with small-scaffold, non-antibody based,
   engineered proteins. These novel diagnostic agents produce high contrast
   images due to their fast clearance from the bloodstream and healthy
   tissues, can be evolved to bind a multitude of cancer biomarkers, and
   are easily functionalized by site-specific bioconjugation methods.
   Several small protein scaffolds have been verified for in vivo molecular
   imaging including affibodies and their two-helix variants, knottins,
   fibronectins, designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), and several
   natural ligands. Further, the biodistribution of these engineered
   ligands can be optimized through rational mutation of the conserved
   regions, careful selection and placement of chelator, and modification
   of molecular size.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen is the main structural protein in vertebrate biology,
   determining the mechanical behavior of connective tissues such as
   tendon, bone and skin. Although extensive efforts in the study of the
   origin of collagen exceptional mechanical properties, a deep knowledge
   of the relationship between molecular structure and mechanical
   properties remains elusive, hindered by the complex hierarchical
   structure of collagen-based tissues. Understanding the viscoelastic
   behavior of collagenous tissues requires knowledge of the properties at
   each structural level. Whole tissues have been studied extensively, but
   less is known about the mechanical behavior at the submicron, fibrillar
   and molecular level. Hence, we investigate the viscoelastic properties
   at the molecular level by using an atomistic modeling approach,
   performing in silica creep tests of a collagen-like peptide. The results
   are compared with creep and relaxation tests at the level of isolated
   collagen fibrils performed previously using a micro-electromechanical
   systems platform. Individual collagen molecules present a non-linear
   viscoelastic behavior, with a Young's modulus increasing from 6 to 16
   GPa (for strains up to 20\%), a viscosity of 3.84 +/- 038 Pa s, and a
   relaxation time in the range of 0.24-0.64 ns. At the fibrils level,
   stress-strain-time data indicate that isolated fibrils exhibit
   viscoelastic behavior that could be fitted using the Maxwell-Weichert
   model. The fibrils showed an elastic modulus of 123 +/- 46 MPa. The
   time-dependent behavior was well fit using the two-time-constant
   Maxwell-Weichert model with a fast time response of 7 +/- 2 s and a slow
   time response of 102 +/- 5 s. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A large literature base has found that economic factors have important
   effects on traffic crashes. A small but growing branch of literature
   also examines the role of gasoline prices in the occurrence of traffic
   crashes. However, no studies have investigated the possible difference

   the monthly traffic crash data from 1998 to 2007 at the county level in
   Minnesota to investigate the possibly different effects gasoline prices
   may have on traffic crashes per million vehicle miles traveled in urban
   versus rural areas. The results indicate that gasoline price effects on
   total crashes, property-damage-only crashes, and injury crashes are
   stronger in rural areas than in urban areas. Gasoline prices also
   significantly affect fatal crashes in both urban and rural areas;
   however, the difference is not significant. The results concerning the
   differences between urban and rural areas have important policy
   implications for traffic safety planners and decision makers. (C) 2013

   Twin Cities metropolitan area (which includes the cities of Minneapolis

   two groups based on the ratio of perceived and estimated commute travel
   time. The measures of network structure are estimated using the street
   network along the identified commute route. T-test comparisons are
   conducted to identify statistically significant differences in estimated
   network measures between the two traveler groups. The combined effect of
   these estimated network measures on travel time is then analyzed using
   regression models. The results from the t-test and regression analyses

Abstract = {{The details surrounding the crossover from wormlike-specific to
   universal polymeric behavior has been the subject of debate and
   confusion even for the simple case of a dilute, unconfined wormlike
   chain. We have directly computed the polymer size, form factor, free
   energy, and Kirkwood diffusivity for unconfined wormlike chains as a
   function of molecular weight, focusing on persistence lengths and
   effective widths that represent single-stranded and double-stranded DNA
   in a high ionic strength buffer. To do so, we use a chain-growth Monte
   Carlo algorithm, the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM), which
   allows us to estimate equilibrium and near-equilibrium dynamic
   properties of wormlike chains over an extremely large range of contour
   lengths. From our calculations, we find that very large DNA chains
   (approximate to 000 000, base pairs depending on the choice of size
   metric) are required to reach flexible, swollen nondraining coils.
   Furthermore, our results indicate that the commonly used model polymer
   lambda-DNA (48 500, base pairs) does not exhibit ``ideal{''} scaling but
   exists in the middle of the transition to long-chain behavior. We
   subsequently conclude that typical DNA used in experiments are too short
   to serve as an accurate model of long-chain, universal polymer behavior.}},

Abstract = {{Androgen receptor (AR) target genes direct development and survival of
   the prostate epithelial lineage, including prostate cancer (PCa). Thus,
   endocrine therapies that inhibit the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) are
   effective in treating PCa. AR transcriptional reactivation is central to
   resistance, as evidenced by the efficacy of AR retargeting in
   castration-resistant PCa (CRPC) with next-generation endocrine therapies
   abiraterone and enzalutamide. However, resistance to abiraterone and
   enzalutamide limits this efficacy in most men, and PCa remains the
   second-leading cause of male cancer deaths. Here we show that AR gene
   rearrangements in CRPC tissues underlie a completely
   androgen-independent, yet AR-dependent, resistance mechanism. We
   discovered intragenic AR gene rearrangements in CRPC tissues, which we
   modeled using transcription activator-like effector nuclease
   (TALEN)-mediated genome engineering. This modeling revealed that these
   AR gene rearrangements blocked full-length AR synthesis, but promoted
   expression of truncated AR variant proteins lacking the AR
   ligand-binding domain. Furthermore, these AR variant proteins maintained
   the constitutive activity of the AR transcriptional program and a CRPC
   growth phenotype independent of full-length AR or androgens. These
   findings demonstrate that AR gene rearrangements are a unique resistance
   mechanism by which AR transcriptional activity can be uncoupled from
   endocrine regulation in CRPC.}},

Title = {{Neural representation in the auditory midbrain of the envelope of
   vocalizations based on a peripheral ear model}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEURAL CIRCUITS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 21}},
Abstract = {{The auditory midbrain implant (AMI) consists of a single shank array (20
   sites) for stimulation along the tonotopic axis of the central nucleus
   of the inferior colliculus (ICC) and has been safely implanted in deaf
   patients who cannot benefit from a cochlear implant (CI). The AMI
   improves lip-reading abilities and environmental awareness in the
   implanted patients. However, the AMI cannot achieve the high levels of
   speech perception possible with the CI. It appears the AMI can transmit
   sufficient spectral cues but with limited temporal cues required for
   speech understanding. Currently, the AMI uses a CI-based strategy, which
   was originally designed to stimulate each frequency region along the
   cochlea with amplitude-modulated pulse trains matching the envelope of
   the bandpass-filtered sound components. However, it is unclear if this
   type of stimulation with only a single site within each frequency lamina
   of the ICC can elicit sufficient temporal cues for speech perception. At
   least speech understanding in quiet is still possible with envelope cues
   as low as 50 Hz. Therefore, we investigated how ICC neurons follow the
   bandpass-filtered envelope structure of natural stimuli in
   ketamine-anesthetized guinea pigs. We identified a subset of ICC neurons
   that could closely follow the envelope structure (up to similar to 100
   Hz) of a diverse set of species-specific calls, which was revealed by
   using a peripheral ear model to estimate the true bandpass-filtered
   envelopes observed by the brain. Although previous studies have
   suggested a complex neural transformation from the auditory nerve to the
   ICC, our data suggest that the brain maintains a robust temporal code in
   a subset of ICC neurons matching the envelope structure of natural
   stimuli. Clinically, these findings suggest that a CI-based strategy may
   still be effective for the AMI if the appropriate neurons are entrained
   to the envelope of the acoustic stimulus and can transmit sufficient
   temporal cues to higher centers.}},

Title = {{Quantitative Analysis of alpha-L-Iduronidase Expression in
   Immunocompetent Mice Treated with the Sleeping Beauty Transposon System}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The Sleeping Beauty transposon system, a non-viral, integrating vector
   that can deliver the alpha-L-iduronidase-encoding gene, is efficient in
   correcting mucopolysaccharidosis type I in NOD/SCID mice. However, in
   previous studies we failed to attain reliable long-term
   alpha-L-iduronidase expression in immunocompetent mice. Here, we focused
   on achieving sustained high-level expression in immunocompetent C57BL/6
   mice. In our standard liver-directed treatment we hydrodynamically
   infuse mice with plasmids containing a SB transposon-encoding human
   alpha-L-iduronidase, along with a source of SB transposase. We sought to
   1) minimize expression of the therapeutic enzyme in antigen-presenting
   cells, while avoiding promoter shutdown and gender bias, 2) increase
   transposition efficiency and 3) improve immunosuppression. By using a
   liver-specific promoter to drive IDUA expression, the SB100X hyperactive
   transposase and transient cyclophosphamide immunosuppression we achieved
   therapeutic-level (>= 100 wild-type) stabilized expression for 1 year in
   50\% of C57BL/6 mice. To gain insights into the causes of variability in
   transgene expression, we quantified the rates of alpha-L-iduronidase
   activity decay vis-a-vis transposition and transgene maintenance using
   the data obtained in this and previous studies. Our analyses showed that
   immune responses are the most important variable to control in order to
   prevent loss of transgene expression. Cumulatively, our results allow
   transition to pre-clinical studies of SB-mediated alpha-L-iduronidase
   expression and correction of mucopolysaccharidosis type I in animal
   models.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient dynamic interactions among cofactor, enzymes and substrate
   molecules are of primary importance for multi-step enzymatic reactions
   with in situ cofactor regeneration. Here we showed for the first time
   that the above dynamic interactions could be significantly intensified
   by exerting an external alternating magnetic field on magnetic
   nanoparticles-supported multi-enzymatic system so that the
   inter-particle collisions due to Brownian motion of nanoparticles could
   be improved. To that end, a multienzyme system including glutamate
   dehydrogenase (GluDH), glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) and cofactor NAD(H)
   were separately immobilized on silica coated Fe3O4 magnetic
   nanoparticles with an average diameter of 105 nm, and the effect of
   magnetic field strength and frequency on the kinetics of the coupled
   bi-enzyme reaction was investigated. It was found that at low magnetic
   field frequency (25 Hz and 100 Hz), increasing magnetic field strength
   from 9.8 to 161.1 Gs led to only very slight increase in reaction rate
   of the coupled bi-enzyme reaction expressed by glucose consumption rate.
   At higher magnetic field of 200 Hz and 500 Hz, reaction rate increased
   significantly with increase of magnetic field strength. When the
   magnetic field frequency was kept at 500 Hz, the reaction rate increased
   from 3.89 mu M/min to 8.11 mu M/min by increasing magnetic field
   strength from 1.3 to 14.2 Gs. The immobilized bi-enzyme system also
   showed good reusability and stability in the magnetic field (500 Hz,
   14.2 Gs), that about 46\% of original activity could be retained after
   33 repeated uses, accounting for totally 34 days continuous operation.
   These results demonstrated the feasibility in intensifying molecular
   interactions among magnetic nanoparticle-supported multienzymes by using
   nano-magnetic stirrer for efficient multi-step transformations. (C) 2013

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NANOPHOTONICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{OCT 18}},
Abstract = {{As the effect of group-velocity dispersion (GVD) on the stability of
   midinfrared quantum-cascade lasers (QCLs) has not been explored so far,
   both amplitude and phase instabilities of QCLs were analyzed in the
   presence of a background saturable absorber in the lasing medium. The
   investigation was carried out through the linearization of the
   Maxwell-Bloch formalism for the lasing medium by including second-order
   dispersion of group velocity and intensity-dependent loss accounting for
   the saturable absorber. The effect of the GVD on laser instability was
   found to be strongly related to the strength of the saturable absorber
   and pumping. The effect of the GVD is more significant at lower pumping
   levels and with weaker saturable absorbers. (C) The Authors. Published

Abstract = {{The narrow bulk band gap and large exciton Bohr radius of germanium (Ge)
   make it an attractive material for optoelectronics utilizing

   to quantum confinement remains scarcely reported. Instead, PL is often
   observed from surface trap states and is independent of nanocrystal (NC)
   size. Here, we demonstrate tunable band gap PL by chemically passivating
   the Ge NC surface. The exchange of native Ge-Cl surface groups with
   alkyl groups using Grignard reagents leads to the first instance of
   tunable band gap emission from free-standing Ge NCs synthesized in the
   gas phase. Ge NCs between 4.8 and 10.2 nm in diameter exhibit
   near-infrared emission featuring spectral line widths that are at least
   a factor of 2 narrower than any previous report.}},

Abstract = {{Emission quenching by fullerenes covalently attached to both ends of a
   series of size-selected regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) samples was

   the distance dependence of the quenching mechanism is considered, this
   is the same value that has been reported for emissive excitons in thin
   films. This result indicates that intrachain exciton transport is more
   facile for excitons localized to single chains than that for excitons
   that are delocalized between chains. In the context of solar cells, the
   result indicates additional complexity and the potential for competing
   issues when considering morphological design of the film to enhance both

Abstract = {{Establishing the time since death is critical in every death
   investigation, yet existing techniques are susceptible to a range of
   errors and biases. For example, forensic entomology is widely used to
   assess the postmortem interval (PMI), but errors can range from days to
   months. Microbes may provide a novel method for estimating PMI that
   avoids many of these limitations. Here we show that postmortem microbial
   community changes are dramatic, measurable, and repeatable in a mouse
   model system, allowing PMI to be estimated within approximately 3 days
   over 48 days. Our results provide a detailed understanding of bacterial
   and microbial eukaryotic ecology within a decomposing corpse system and
   suggest that microbial community data can be developed into a forensic
   tool for estimating PMI.}},

Abstract = {{A highly stable coherent beam-combining system has been designed to
   measure self-phasing in fiber lasers due to nonlinear effects. Whereas
   self-phasing in previous coherent combination experiments has been
   principally attributed to wavelength shifting, these wavelength effects
   have been efficiently suppressed in our experiment by using a dual-core
   fiber with closely balanced optical path lengths. The self-phasing from
   nonlinear effects could then be measured independently and directly by
   common-path interferometry with a probe laser. The Kramers-Kronig effect
   in the fiber gain media was observed to induce a phase shift that
   effectively canceled the applied path length errors, resulting in
   efficient lasing under all phase conditions. This process was
   demonstrated to result in robust lasing over a large range of pump
   conditions. (C) 2013 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{Despite reports in the literature of superior contaminant degradation in
   the root-zone of plants, this phenomenon, known as the rhizosphere
   effect, is poorly understood. We investigated whether root exudates
   could enhance desorption of residual pollutants, thus improving
   bioavailability and subsequent biodegradation potential. Root exudates
   were harvested from three species of hydroponically grown plants, and
   artificial root exudates (AREs) were created using a literature recipe.
   Aliquots of the exudates were metabolized by soil bacteria to
   investigate whether biotransformed exudates exhibited different chemical
   characteristics or had different effects on contaminant bioavailability
   than `raw exudates.' Slurries of naphthalene-aged soil containing raw
   exudates had a significantly lower soil-water distribution coefficient
   (K-d) than slurries with metabolized exudates or no-exudate controls,
   exhibiting median reductions of 50\% and 55\%, respectively. Raw
   exudates had a significantly lower surface tension while not increasing
   overall solubility, indicating the presence of surface-active compounds
   below the critical micelle concentration; this is a newly observed
   mechanism of the rhizosphere effect. Exudate samples were characterized
   by specific UV absorbance, spectral slope, fluorescence index, and
   excitation-emission matrices. Substantial changes in organic carbon
   character pre- and postmetabolism, and between harvested exudates and
   AREs, suggest that AREs are not chemically representative of plant root
   exudates. Overall, we present evidence that enhanced contaminant
   desorption in the presence of exudates provides an abiotic contribution
   to the rhizosphere effect.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic lethal interactions enable a novel approach for discovering
   specific genetic vulnerabilities in cancer cells that can be exploited

   a comparative genomic strategy for identifying cancer-relevant synthetic
   lethal interactions whereby candidate interactions are prioritized on
   the basis of genetic interaction data available in yeast, followed by
   targeted testing of candidate interactions in human cell lines. As a
   proof of principle, we describe two novel synthetic lethal interactions
   in human cells discovered by this approach, one between the tumor
   suppressor gene SMARCB1 and PSMA4, and another between alveolar
   soft-part sarcoma-associated ASPSCR1 and PSMC2. These results suggest
   therapeutic targets for cancers harboring mutations in SMARCB1 or
   ASPSCR1 and highlight the potential of a targeted, cross-species

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to understand the physical meaning and
   evaluate the intrinsic length scale parameters, featured in the theories
   of gradient elasticity, by deploying the analytical treatment and
   experimental measurements of the dispersion of elastic waves. The
   developments are focused on examining the propagation of longitudinal
   waves in an aluminum rod with periodically varying cross-section. First,
   the analytical solution for the dispersion relationship, based on the
   periodic cell analysis of a bi-layered laminate and Bloch theorem, is
   compared to two competing models of gradient elasticity. It is shown
   that the customary gradient elastic model with two length-scale
   parameters is able to capture the dispersion accurately up to the
   beginning of the first band gap. On the other hand, the gradient elastic
   model with an additional length scale (affiliated with the fourth-order
   time derivative in the field equation) is shown to capture not only the
   first dispersion branch before the band gap, but also the band gap
   itself and the preponderance of the second branch. Closed form relations
   between the microstructure parameters and the intrinsic length scales
   are obtained for both gradient elasticity models. By way of the
   asymptotic treatment in the limit of a weak contrast between the
   laminae, a clear physical meaning and scaling of the length-scale
   parameters was established in terms of: (i) the microstructure (given by
   the size of the unit cell and the contrast between the laminae), and
   (ii) thus induced dispersion relationship (characterized by the location
   and the width of the band gap). The analysis is verified through an
   experimental observation of wave dispersion, and wave attenuation within
   the band gap. A comparison between the analytical treatment, the
   gradient elastic model with three intrinsic length scales, and
   experimental measurements demonstrates a good agreement over the range
   of frequencies considered. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with maximum entropy completion of partially specified
   block-circulant matrices. Since positive definite symmetric circulants
   happen to be covariance matrices of stationary periodic processes, in
   particular of stationary reciprocal processes, this problem has
   applications in signal processing, in particular to image modeling. In
   fact it is strictly related to maximum likelihood estimation of
   bilateral AR-type representations of acausal signals subject to certain
   conditional independence constraints. The maximum entropy completion
   problem for block-circulant matrices has recently been solved by the
   authors, although leaving open the problem of an efficient computation
   of the solution. In this paper, we provide an efficient algorithm for
   computing its solution which compares very favorably with existing
   algorithms designed for positive definite matrix extension problems. The
   proposed algorithm benefits from the analysis of the relationship
   between our problem and the band-extension problem for block-Toeplitz
   matrices also developed in this paper. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{A thin liquid film resting on a solid substrate that is heated or cooled
   from below experiences surface tension gradients, which lead to
   Marangoni flows. We explore the behavior of such a film on a chemically
   patterned substrate which drives film dewetting in order to determine
   how surface patterning and applied temperature gradients can be designed
   to influence the behavior of thin-film coatings. A nonlinear partial
   differential equation for the film height based on lubrication theory is
   solved numerically for a broad range of problem parameters. Uniform
   cooling of the substrate is found to significantly delay dewetting that
   is driven by wettability gradients. Uniform heating speeds up dewetting
   but can destroy the near-perfect templating imposed by the surface
   patterning. However, localized heating and cooling together can
   accelerate dewetting while maintaining templating quality. Localized
   heating and cooling can also be used to drive liquid onto areas that it
   would dewet from in the absence of heating. Overall, these results
   indicate that applied temperature gradients can significantly influence
   dewetting driven by surface patterning, and suggest strategies for the
   creation of spatially patterned thin-film coatings and flow control in
   microfluidic devices. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The structures of nanoparticles, macromolecules, and molecular clusters
   in gas phase environments are often studied via measurement of collision
   cross sections. To directly compare structure models to measurements, it
   is hence necessary to have computational techniques available to
   calculate the collision cross sections of structural models under
   conditions matching measurements. However, presently available collision
   cross section methods contain the underlying assumption that collision
   between gas molecules and structures are completely elastic (gas
   molecule translational energy conserving) and specular, while
   experimental evidence suggests that in the most commonly used background
   gases for measurements, air and molecular nitrogen, gas molecule
   reemission is largely inelastic (with exchange of energy between
   vibrational, rotational, and translational modes) and should be treated
   as diffuse in computations with fixed structural models. In this work,
   we describe computational techniques to predict the free molecular
   collision cross sections for fixed structural models of gas phase
   entities where inelastic and non-specular gas molecule reemission rules
   can be invoked, and the long range ion-induced dipole (polarization)
   potential between gas molecules and a charged entity can be considered.
   Specifically, two calculation procedures are described detail: a diffuse
   hard sphere scattering (DHSS) method, in which structures are modeled as
   hard spheres and collision cross sections are calculated for rectilinear
   trajectories of gas molecules, and a diffuse trajectory method (DTM), in
   which the assumption of rectilinear trajectories is relaxed and the
   ion-induced dipole potential is considered. Collision cross section
   calculations using the DHSS and DTM methods are performed on spheres,
   models of quasifractal aggregates of varying fractal dimension, and
   fullerene like structures. Techniques to accelerate DTM calculations by
   assessing the contribution of grazing gas molecule collisions (gas
   molecules with altered trajectories by the potential interaction)
   without tracking grazing trajectories are further discussed. The
   presented calculation techniques should enable more accurate collision
   cross section predictions under experimentally relevant conditions than
   preexisting approaches, and should enhance the ability of collision
   cross section measurement schemes to discern the structures of gas phase
   entities. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Micro fuel cells (MFCs) defined by an average power output of less than
   10 W offer the potential to improve the runtime and performance of
   portable devices by providing significantly higher energy density
   (energy per unit volume) than batteries. However, despite several
   decades of intense research and development, MFCs have yet to realize
   this potential, and no MFC technology has achieved broad market
   adoption. We report in this article an MFC which utilizes
   water-vapor-driven hydride hydrolysis, fuel cell water recovery, and a
   self-regulating pneumatic valve to achieve higher energy density than
   conventional batteries. Integrated MFC prototypes were developed and
   tested, and achieved 987 Wh L-1. Further improvements in energy density
   are possible by optimizing the fuel pellet configuration (density,
   geometry, particle size and distribution, etc.). Energy density greater
   than 2000 Wh L-1 may be possible in optimized MFCs discharged at low
   power. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this investigation is to formulate, implement, and
   definitively validate a numerical simulation model to predict particle
   separation and concomitant mass transfer by means of a swirl chamber or
   swirl tube. The separation model encompassed three-dimensional turbulent
   fluid flow abetted with a particle transport model. All components of
   the model were used in their native form, without tuning or adaptation
   to accommodate the problem in question. Experiments were performed which
   were a precise replica of the numerical simulations in order to provide
   an unequivocal basis for evaluating the efficacy and validity of the
   simulation model. The experiments involved air flow as the carrier
   fluid. The particle-laden flow was ducted through a straight pipe to a
   three-bladed swirl generator from which the emergent swirling flow
   entered a settling chamber where the centrifugal forces propelled the
   particles toward the chamber walls. At the downstream end of the
   chamber, provision was made for the wall-adjacent particles to be
   collected. The non-collected particles exited through a central
   aperture. The investigation was performed for air velocities between 5
   and 36m/s. The key results that were extracted from both the numerical
   simulations and the experiments are the collection efficiency and the
   pressure drop. Comparison of the experimental and simulation results
   revealed very good agreement. This outcome lends unequivocal support to
   the numerical simulation model as a predictive tool for particle
   separations in swirl-chamber or swirl-tube devices.}},

Abstract = {{We describe a method for differential phase measurement of Faraday
   rotation from multiple depth locations simultaneously. A
   polarization-maintaining fiber-based spectral-domain interferometer that
   utilizes a low-coherent light source and a single camera is developed.
   Light decorrelated by the orthogonal channels of the fiber is launched
   on a sample as two oppositely polarized circular states. These states
   reflect from sample surfaces and interfere with the corresponding states
   of the reference arm. A custom spectrometer, which is designed to
   simplify camera alignment, separates the orthogonal channels and records
   the interference-related oscillations on both spectra. Inverse Fourier
   transform of the spectral oscillations in k-space yields complex depth
   profiles, whose amplitudes and phase difference are related to
   reflectivity and Faraday rotation within the sample, respectively.
   Information along a full depth profile is produced at the camera speed
   without performing an axial scan for a multisurface sample. System
   sensitivity for the Faraday rotation measurement is 0.86 min of arc.

Abstract = {{Thermally assisted transfer printing was employed to pattern thin films
   of high capacitance ion gels on polyimide, poly(ethylene terephthalate),
   and SiO2 substrates. The ion gels consisted of 20 M \% block copolymer
   poly(styrene-b-ethylene oxide-b-styrene and 80 wt \% ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethyl sulfonyl)amide.
   Patterning resolution was on the order of 10 mu m. Importantly, ion gels
   containing the block polymer with short PS end blocks (3.4 kg/mol) could
   be transfer-printed because of thermoreversible gelation that enabled
   intimate gel-substrate contact at 100 degrees C, while gels with long PS
   blocks (11 kg/mol) were not printable at the same temperature due to
   poor wetting contact between the gel and substrates. By using printed
   ion gels as high-capacitance gate insulators, electrolyte-gated
   thin-film transistors were fabricated that operated at low voltages (<1
   V) with high on/off current ratios (similar to 10(5)). Statistical
   analysis of carrier mobility, turn-on voltage, and on/off ratio for an
   array of printed transistors demonstrated the excellent reproducibility
   of the printing technique. The results show that transfer printing is an
   attractive route to pattern high-capacitance ion gels for flexible
   thin-film devices.}},

Abstract = {{The template-stripping method can yield smooth patterned films without
   surface contamination. However, the process is typically limited to
   coinage metals such as silver and gold because other materials cannot be
   readily stripped from silicon templates due to strong adhesion. Herein,
   we report a more general template-stripping method that is applicable to
   a larger variety of materials, including refractory metals,
   semiconductors, and oxides. To address the adhesion issue, we introduce
   a thin gold layer between the template and the deposited materials.
   After peeling off the combined film from the template, the gold layer
   can be selectively removed via wet etching to reveal a smooth patterned
   structure of the desired material. Further, we demonstrate
   template-stripped multilayer structures that have potential applications
   for photovoltaics and solar absorbers. An entire patterned device, which
   can include a transparent conductor, semiconductor absorber, and back
   contact, can be fabricated. Since our approach can also produce many
   copies of the patterned structure with high fidelity by reusing the
   template, a low-cost and high-throughput process in micro- and
   nanofabrication is provided that is useful for electronics, plasmonics,
   and nanophotonics.}},

Title = {{The ORCA2 transcription factor plays a key role in regulation of the
   terpenoid indole alkaloid pathway}},
Journal = {{BMC PLANT BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: The terpenoid indole alkaloid (TIA) pathway leads to the
   production of pharmaceutically important drugs, such as the anticancer
   compounds vinblastine and vincristine. Unfortunately, these drugs are
   produced in trace amounts, causing them to be very costly. To increase
   production of these drugs, an improved understanding of the TIA
   regulatory pathway is needed. Towards this end, transgenic Catharanthus
   roseus hairy roots that overexpress the ORCA2 TIA transcriptional
   activator were generated and characterized.
   Results: Transcriptional profiling experiments revealed that
   overexpression of ORCA2 results in altered expression of key genes from
   the indole and terpenoid pathways, which produce precursors for the TIA
   pathway, and from the TIA pathway itself. In addition,
   metabolite-profiling experiments revealed that overexpression of ORCA2
   significantly affects the levels of several TIA metabolites. ORCA2
   overexpression also causes significant increases in transcript levels of
   several TIA regulators, including TIA transcriptional repressors.
   Conclusions: Results presented here indicate that ORCA2 plays a critical
   role in regulation of TIA metabolism. ORCA2 regulates expression of key
   genes from both feeder pathways, as well as the genes (STR and SGD)
   encoding the enzymes that catalyze the first two steps in TIA
   biosynthesis. ORCA2 may play an especially important role in regulation
   of the downstream branches of the TIA pathway, as it regulates four out
   of five genes characterized from this part of the pathway. Regulation of
   TIA transcriptional repressors by ORCA2 may provide a mechanism whereby
   increases in TIA metabolite levels in response to external stimuli are
   transient and limited in magnitude.}},

Abstract = {{We have expanded the livestock gene editing toolbox to include
   transcription activator-like (TAL) effector nuclease (TALEN)- and
   clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
   (CRISPR)/Cas9-stimulated homology-directed repair (HDR) using plasmid,
   rAAV, and oligonucleotide templates. Toward the genetic dehorning of
   dairy cattle, we introgressed a bovine POLLED allele into horned bull
   fibroblasts. Single nucleotide alterations or small indels were
   introduced into 14 additional genes in pig, goat, and cattle fibroblasts
   using TALEN mRNA and oligonucleotide transfection with efficiencies of
   10-50\% in populations. Several of the chosen edits mimic naturally
   occurring performance-enhancing or disease-resistance alleles, including
   alteration of single base pairs. Up to 70\% of the fibroblast colonies
   propagated without selection harbored the intended edits, of which more
   than one-half were homozygous. Edited fibroblasts were used to generate
   pigs with knockout alleles in the DAZL and APC genes to model
   infertility and colon cancer. Our methods enable unprecedented
   meiosis-free intraspecific and interspecific introgression of select
   alleles in livestock for agricultural and biomedical applications.}},

Title = {{Enhanced reversibility and unusual microstructure of a

Journal = {{NATURE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{502}},
Number = {{7469}},

Abstract = {{Materials undergoing reversible solid-to-solid martensitic phase
   transformations are desirable for applications in medical sensors and
   actuators(1), eco-friendly refrigerators(2,3) and energy conversion
   devices(4). The ability to pass back and forth through the phase
   transformation many times without degradation of properties (termed
   `reversibility') is critical for these applications. Materials tuned to
   satisfy a certain geometric compatibility condition have been
   shown(2,5-14) to exhibit high reversibility, measured by low hysteresis
   and small migration of transformation temperature under
   cycling(6,9,12,15). Recently, stronger compatibility conditions called
   the `cofactor conditions'(5,15) have been proposed theoretically to
   achieve even better reversibility. Here we report the enhanced
   reversibility and unusual microstructure of the first martensitic
   material, Zn45Au30Cu25, that closely satisfies the cofactor conditions.
   We observe four striking properties of thismaterial. (1) Despite a
   transformation strain of 8\%, the transformation temperature shifts less
   than 0.5 degrees C after more than 16,000 thermal cycles. For
   comparison, the transformation temperature of the ubiquitous NiTi alloy
   shifts up to 20 degrees C in the first 20 cycles(9,16). (2) The
   hysteresis remains approximately 2 degrees C during this cycling. For
   comparison, the hysteresis of the NiTi alloy is up to 70 degrees C (refs
   9, 12). (3) The alloy exhibits an unusual riverine microstructure of
   martensite not seen in other martensites. (4) Unlike that of typical
   polycrystal martensites, its microstructure changes drastically in
   consecutive transformation cycles, whereas macroscopic properties such
   as transformation temperature and latent heat are nearly reproducible.
   These results promise a concrete strategy for seeking ultra-reliable
   martensitic materials.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the potential benefits of an imminent collision
   prediction system for improving occupant protection in a frontal
   automotive crash. Knowledge of an impending unavoidable crash is assumed
   to be known 100ms before the crash occurs. A three dof human occupant
   model is developed using a Lagrangian approach to represent occupant
   translation with respect to seat, torso rotation and neck rotation. The
   performance of traditional elastic seat belts is compared with that of
   an analytically calculated seat belt law in which the force values are
   calculated in real-time so as to just prevent collision with car
   interior. Simulations verify that the analytical seat belt force
   calculation results in less force on occupant for the same level of
   safety. Furthermore, results show that knowledge of a future collision
   can be used to pre-tension seat belts but can provide no additional
   benefits, if seat belts are the only means for active occupant
   protection. However, if seat tilt-back can be deployed using an on-off
   mechanism, such predictive knowledge of a future collision can provide
   significantly improved occupant protection in terms of preventing
   occupant collision with car interior.}},

Abstract = {{The production of dry-grind corn ethanol results in the generation of
   intermediate products, thin and whole stillage, which require
   energy-intensive downstream processing for conversion into commercial
   animal feed products. Hydrothermal carbonization of thin and whole
   stillage coupled with anaerobic digestion was investigated as
   alternative processing methods that could benefit the industry. By
   substantially eliminating evaporation of water, reductions in downstream
   energy consumption from 65\% to 73\% were achieved while generating
   hydrochar, fatty acids, treated process water, and biogas co-products
   providing new opportunities for the industry. Processing whole stillage
   in this manner produced the four co-products, eliminated centrifugation
   and evaporation, and substantially reduced drying. With thin stillage,
   all four co-products were again produced, as well as a high quality
   animal feed. Anaerobic digestion of the aqueous product stream from the
   hydrothermal carbonization of thin stillage reduced chemical oxygen
   demand (COD) by more than 90\% and converted 83\% of the initial COD to
   methane. Internal use of this biogas could entirely fuel the HTC process
   and reduce overall natural gas usage. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2013;110:

Pages = {{106-115}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This paper investigates the size effect on the strength of bimaterial
   hybrid structures, which consist of a weak bimaterial interface. A
   general scaling relation was recently derived by combining the energetic
   scaling of fracture of the bimaterial notch and the finite weakest link
   model. This scaling relation is now studied through a stochastic
   cohesive crack model, which is able to capture the fracture process at
   the bimaterial notch tip as well as the random fracture properties of
   the bimaterial interface. The numerical example includes a series of
   metal-composite hybrid beams with a centered V-notch under three-point
   bending. A wide range of notch angles is considered, which represents
   various orders of stress singularities. The simulation shows that, as
   the stress singularities get weaker, there exists a transition from the
   energetic scaling to the statistical scaling. Within this transition
   range, the size effect on the structural strength can be explained by a
   combined energetic-statistical mechanism. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. To investigate mathematically and experimentally the sources of
   errors in localization of COMS-type plaques in melanoma brachytherapy
   when using ultrasound and transillumination and to give recommendations
   to avoid such errors.
   METHODS. A computer-aided simulation tool was developed to model the
   errors seen in the patient images when using ultrasound imaging and
   transillumination during localization of the COMS-type plaque in
   melanoma brachytherapy. Several laboratory experiments were performed on
   sheep eyes to confirm the validity of the error sources and the
   simulator outputs. Results were compared to the intraoperative
   ultrasonographic patient images for validation.
   RESULTS. Based on mathematical modeling and computer simulation results,
   transillumination provides acceptable accuracy for small to medium
   tumors with less than 7-mm height but shows poor accuracy as the tumor
   height increases. In ultrasound imaging, two sources of error are
   predicted in longitudinal scan using our computer simulation modeling,
   and the results are supported by the experiments on sheep eyes and
   patient images taken during the operation. Both errors are related to
   the lens. The first error is due to attenuation and refraction of the
   lens causing opaque areas and a change of curvature in the image of the
   plaque edge that is nearest to the lens. The second type of error is
   related to the total internal reflection from the lens.
   CONCLUSIONS. The simulation method presented in this article allows
   quantitative assessment of the sources, mechanisms, and measures of
   errors in localization of the CMOS-type plaques by ultrasound and
   transillumination techniques. Errors predicted by the simulation method
   are validated by experiments. Error assessment by this method provides
   guidelines for avoiding such errors.}},

Abstract = {{Thrombin is a serine protease and regulator of hemostasis that plays a
   critical role in the formation of obstructive blood clots, or
   thrombosis, that is a life-threatening condition associated with
   numerous diseases such as atherosclerosis and stroke. To detect thrombi
   in living animals, we design and conjugate thrombin-sensitive peptide
   substrates to the surface of nanoparticles. Following intravenous
   infusion, these ``synthetic biomarkers{''} survey the host vasculature
   for coagulation and, in response to substrate cleavage by thrombin,
   release ligand-encoded reporters into the host urine. To detect the
   urinary reporters, we develop a companion 96-well immunoassay that
   utilizes antibodies to bind specifically to the ligands, thus capturing
   the reporters for quantification. Using a thromboplastin-induced mouse
   model of pulmonary embolism, we show that urinary biomarker levels
   differentiate between healthy and thrombotic states and correlate
   closely with the aggregate burden of clots formed in the lungs. Our
   results demonstrate that synthetic biomarkers can be engineered to sense
   vascular diseases remotely from the urine and may allow applications in
   point-of-care diagnostics.}},

Abstract = {{Study Design:In vitro comparative, laboratory experiments.Objective:This
   study developed a laboratory apparatus that measured resistance to
   failure using pressures similar to intradiscal pressure of a lumbar
   spinal disk. Various combinations of an anular repair device were
   compared.Summary of Background Context:Herniated material of the
   intervertebral disk is removed during a lumbar discectomy; however, the
   defect in the anulus fibrosus remains and can provide a pathway for
   future herniation. Repairing the anulus fibrosus could mitigate this
   reherniation and improve patient outcomes.Methods:A pneumatic cylinder
   was used to increase the pressure of a sealed chamber until artificial
   nucleus pulposus material was expulsed through either a 3-mm circular
   (diameter) or a 6-mm slit anular defect created in a surrogate anulus
   fibrosus. Each unrepaired condition was compared with 3 repaired
   conditions using a commercially available soft tissue repair system. The
   repaired conditions included: (1) a single tension band; (2) 2 tension
   bands in a cruciate pattern; or (3) 2 tension bands in a parallel
   pattern. Maximum pressure at the point of extrusion of the internal
   chamber material and failure or nonfailure of the repair was
   measured.Results:Significant differences were detected (P<0.05) in
   maximum failure pressures for the nonrepaired (control) versus repaired
   conditions. With 1 or 2 tension bands repairing the circular defect, the
   maximum failure pressure increased by approximately 76\% and 131\%,
   respectively. In addition, the failure pressure for 2 tension bands in
   either a cruciate or parallel configuration was not different, and was
   approximately 32\% higher (P<0.05) than a single tension band in the
   case of the circular defect. Similar results were seen for the slit
   defect, with the exception that no difference between the repaired
   conditions (ie, single vs. 2 tension bands) was
   detected.Conclusions:This laboratory simulation demonstrated that
   repairing the anulus fibrosus after a discectomy procedure can be
   beneficial for retaining intradiscal material. The use of 2 tension
   bands, versus a single tension band, in either a cruciate or parallel
   configuration may further improve the ability to retain disk material.}},

Title = {{On the mechanism of wetting failure during fluid displacement along a
   moving substrate}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{25}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This work investigates the onset of wetting failure for displacement of
   Newtonian fluids in parallel channels. A hydrodynamic model is developed
   for planar geometries where an advancing fluid displaces a receding
   fluid along a moving substrate. The model is evaluated with three
   distinct approaches: (i) the low-speed asymptotic theory of Cox {[}J.
   Fluid Mech. 168, 169-194 (1986)], (ii) a one-dimensional (1D)
   lubrication approach, and (iii) a two-dimensional (2D) flow model solved
   with the Galerkin finite element method (FEM). Approaches (ii) and (iii)
   predict the onset of wetting failure at a critical capillary number
   Ca-crit, which coincides with a turning point in the steady-state
   solution family for a given set of system parameters. The 1D model fails
   to accurately describe interface shapes near the three-phase contact
   line when air is the receding fluid, producing large errors in estimates
   of Ca-crit for these systems. Analysis of the 2D flow solution reveals
   that strong pressure gradients are needed to pump the receding fluid
   away from the contact line. A mechanism is proposed in which wetting
   failure results when capillary forces can no longer support the pressure
   gradients necessary to steadily displace the receding fluid. The effects
   of viscosity ratio, substrate wettability, and fluid inertia are then
   investigated through comparisons of Ca-crit values and characteristics
   of the interface shape. Surprisingly, the low-speed asymptotic theory
   (i) matches trends computed from (iii) throughout the entire
   investigated parameter space. Furthermore, predictions of Ca-crit from
   the 2D flow model compare favorably to values measured in experimental
   air-entrainment studies, supporting the proposed wetting-failure
   mechanism. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Although many individual route choice models have been proposed to
   incorporate travel time variability as a decision factor, they are
   typically still deterministic in the sense that the optimal strategy
   requires choosing one particular route that maximizes utility. In
   contrast, this study introduces an individual route choice model where
   choosing a portfolio of routes instead of a single route is the best
   strategy for a rational traveler who cares about both journey time and
   lateness when facing stochastic network conditions. The proposed model
   is compared with UE and SUE models and the difference in both behavioral
   foundation and model characteristics is highlighted. A numerical example
   is introduced to demonstrate how such model can be used in traffic
   assignment problem. The model is then tested with GPS data collected in
   metropolitan Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota. Our data suggest there is
   no single dominant route (defined here as a route with the shortest
   travel time for a 15 day period) in 18\% of cases when links travel
   times are correlated. This paper demonstrates that choosing a portfolio
   of routes could be the rational choice of a traveler who wants to
   optimize route decisions under variability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In the Minneapolis-St. Paul region (Twin Cities), the Minnesota
   Department of Transportation (MnDOT) converted the Interstate 394 High
   Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes to High Occupancy Toll (HOT) lanes (or
   MnPASS Express Lanes). These lanes allow single occupancy vehicles
   (SOVs) to access the HOV lanes by paying a fee. This fee is adjusted
   according to a dynamic pricing system that varies with the current
   demand. This paper estimates the value placed by the travelers on the
   HOT lanes because of improvements in travel time reliability. This value
   depends on how the travelers regard a route with predictable travel
   times (or small travel time variability) in comparison to another with
   unpredictable travel times (or high travel time variability). For this
   purpose, commuters are recruited and equipped with Global Positioning
   System (GPS) devices and instructed to commute for two weeks on each of
   three plausible alternatives between their home in the western suburbs
   of Minneapolis eastbound to work in downtown or the University of
   Minnesota: I-394 HOT lanes, I-394 General Purpose lanes (untolled), and
   signalized arterials close to the I-394 corridor. They are then given
   the opportunity to travel on their preferred route after experiencing
   each alternative. This revealed preference data is then analyzed using
   discrete choice models of route. Three measures of reliability are
   explored and incorporated in the estimation of the models: standard
   deviation (a classical measure in the research literature); shortened
   right range (typically found in departure time choice models); and
   interquartile range (75th-25th percentile). Each of these measures
   represents distinct ways about how travelers deal with different
   sections of reliability. In all the models, it was found that
   reliability was valued highly (and statistically significantly), but
   differently according to how it was defined. The estimated value of
   reliability in each of the models indicates that commuters are willing
   to pay a fee for a reliable route depending on how they value their
   reliability savings. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This brief presents a novel scalable architecture for in-place fast
   Fourier transform (IFFT) computation for real-valued signals. The
   proposed computation is based on a modified radix-2 algorithm, which
   removes the redundant operations from the flow graph. A new processing
   element (PE) is proposed using two radix-2 butterflies that can process
   four inputs in parallel. A novel conflict-free memory-addressing scheme
   is proposed to ensure the continuous operation of the FFT processor.
   Furthermore, the addressing scheme is extended to support multiple
   parallel PEs. The proposed real-FFT processor simultaneously requires
   fewer computation cycles and lower hardware cost compared to prior work.
   For example, the proposed design with two PEs reduces the computation
   cycles by a factor of 2 for a 256-point real fast Fourier transform
   (RFFT) compared to a prior work while maintaining a lower hardware
   complexity. The number of computation cycles is reduced proportionately
   with the increase in the number of PEs.}},

Abstract = {{Covered by waves with various lengths, the mobile sea surface represents
   a great challenge to the large-eddy simulation (LES) of atmospheric
   boundary layer flow over the ocean surface. In this study, we report
   recent developments and tests of dynamic modeling approaches for the
   subgrid-scale (SGS) sea-surface roughness for LES. In the model,
   introduced originally in Yang et al. (J. Fluid Mech., in press, 2013),
   the SGS roughness is quantified by an integral of the SGS wave spectrum,
   , weighted based on the wind-wave kinematics, with an unknown model
   coefficient alpha (w) as pre-factor. The coefficient alpha (w) is
   determined dynamically based on the basic constraint that the total
   surface drag force must be independent of the LES filter scale. The
   weighted integral represents the effective amplitude of the SGS waves,
   for which five candidate models are reviewed. Following the
   computational tests presented in Yang et al. (J. Fluid Mech., in press,
   2013), in this study the performance of the dynamic SGS sea-surface
   roughness models is assessed by a theoretical approach, in which the
   roughness model is coupled with the critical-layer theory of wind-wave
   interaction. This theoretical approach mimics the averaged behavior of
   the LES. Meanwhile, its low computation cost allows the assessment of
   the model performance over a wide range of parameters. The test results
   indicate that the dynamic modeling approach can reliably model the
   roughness length of the SGS waves without ad-hoc prescription of the
   model parameter alpha (w) . Also, we confirm that to model , an
   expression based on the kinematics of wind-wave relative motion achieves
   the best performance among the five candidate models considered.}},

Abstract = {{Custom TAL effector nucleases (TALENs) are increasingly used as reagents
   to manipulate genomes in vivo. Here, we used TALENs to modify the genome
   of the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. We engineered seven TALENs
   targeting five Arabidopsis genes, namely ADH1, TT4, MAPKKK1, DSK2B, and
   NATA2. In pooled seedlings expressing the TALENs, we observed somatic
   mutagenesis frequencies ranging from 2-15\% at the intended targets for
   all seven TALENs. Somatic mutagenesis frequencies as high as 41-73\%
   were observed in individual transgenic plant lines expressing the
   TALENs. Additionally, a TALEN pair targeting a tandemly duplicated gene
   induced a 4.4-kb deletion in somatic cells. For the most active TALEN
   pairs, namely those targeting ADH1 and NATA2, we found that
   TALEN-induced mutations were transmitted to the next generation at
   frequencies of 1.5-12\%. Our work demonstrates that TALENs are useful
   reagents for achieving targeted mutagenesis in this important plant

Abstract = {{Tandemly arrayed genes (TAGs) or gene clusters are prevalent in higher
   eukaryotic genomes. For example, approximately 17\% of genes are
   organized in tandem in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The genetic
   redundancy created by TAGs presents a challenge for reverse genetics. As
   molecular scissors, engineered zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) make DNA
   double-strand breaks in a sequence-specific manner. ZFNs thus provide a
   means to delete TAGs by creating two double-strand breaks in the gene
   cluster. Using engineered ZFNs, we successfully targeted seven genes
   from three TAGs on two Arabidopsis chromosomes, including the well-known
   RPP4 gene cluster, which contains eight resistance (R) genes. The
   resulting gene cluster deletions ranged from a few kb to 55 kb with
   frequencies approximating 1\% in somatic cells. We also obtained large
   chromosomal deletions of similar to 9 Mb at approximately one tenth the
   frequency, and gene cluster inversions and duplications also were
   achieved. This study demonstrates the ability to use sequence-specific
   nucleases in plants to make targeted chromosome rearrangements and
   create novel chimeric genes for reverse genetics and biotechnology.}},

Abstract = {{Zinc-finger nucleases have proven to be successful as reagents for
   targeted genome manipulation in Drosophila melanogaster and many other
   organisms. Their utility has been limited, however, by the significant
   failure rate of new designs, reflecting the complexity of DNA
   recognition by zinc fingers. Transcription activator-like effector
   (TALE) DNA-binding domains depend on a simple, one-moduleto-
   one-base-pair recognition code, and they have been very productively
   incorporated into nucleases (TALENs) for genome engineering. In this
   report we describe the design of TALENs for a number of different genes
   in Drosophila, and we explore several parameters of TALEN design. The
   rate of success with TALENs was substantially greater than for
   zinc-finger nucleases, and the frequency of mutagenesis was comparable.
   Knockout mutations were isolated in several genes in which such alleles
   were not previously available. TALENs are an effective tool for targeted
   genome manipulation in Drosophila.}},

Abstract = {{Synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis automates yeast genetics,
   enabling high-throughput construction of ordered arrays of double
   mutants. Quantitative colony sizes derived from SGA analysis can be used
   to measure cellular fitness and score for genetic interactions, such as
   synthetic lethality. Here we show that SGA colony sizes also can be used
   to obtain global maps of meiotic recombination because recombination
   frequency affects double-mutant formation for gene pairs located on the
   same chromosome and therefore influences the size of the resultant
   double-mutant colony. We obtained quantitative colony size data for
   similar to 1.2 million double mutants located on the same chromosome and
   constructed a genome-scale genetic linkage map at similar to 5 kb
   resolution. We found that our linkage map is reproducible and consistent
   with previous global studies of meiotic recombination. In particular, we
   confirmed that the total number of crossovers per chromosome tends to
   follow a simple linear model that depends on chromosome size. In
   addition, we observed a previously unappreciated relationship between
   the size of linkage regions surrounding each centromere and chromosome
   size, suggesting that crossovers tend to occur farther away from the
   centromere on larger chromosomes. The pericentric regions of larger
   chromosomes also appeared to load larger clusters of meiotic cohesin
   Rec8, and acquire fewer Spo11-catalyzed DNA double-strand breaks. Given
   that crossovers too near or too far from centromeres are detrimental to
   homolog disjunction and increase the incidence of aneuploidy, our data
   suggest that chromosome size may have a direct role in regulating the
   fidelity of chromosome segregation during meiosis.}},

Abstract = {{Studies of the genetics underlying inflammatory bowel diseases have
   increased our understanding of the pathways involved in both ulcerative
   colitis and Crohn's disease and focused attention on the role of the
   microbiome in these diseases. Full understanding of pathogenesis will
   require a comprehensive grasp of the delicate homeostasis between gut
   bacteria and the human host. In this review, we present current evidence
   of microbiome-gene interactions in the context of other known risk
   factors and mechanisms, and describe the next steps necessary to pair
   genetic variant and microbiome sequencing data from patient cohorts. We
   discuss the concept of dysbiosis, proposing that the functional
   composition of the gut microbiome may provide a more consistent
   definition of dysbiosis and may more readily provide evidence of
   genome-microbiome interactions in future exploratory studies.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses two key limitations of the unscented Kalman filter
   (UKF) when applied to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM)
   problem: the cubic computational complexity in the number of states and
   the inconsistency of the state estimates. To address the first issue, we
   introduce a new sampling strategy for the UKF, which has constant
   computational complexity. As a result, the overall computational
   complexity of UKF-based SLAM becomes of the same order as that of the
   extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based SLAM, i.e., quadratic in the size of
   the state vector. Furthermore, we investigate the inconsistency issue by
   analyzing the observability properties of the linear-regression-based
   model employed by the UKF. Based on this analysis, we propose a new
   algorithm, termed observability-constrained (OC)-UKF, which ensures the
   unobservable subspace of the UKF's linear-regression-based system model
   is of the same dimension as that of the nonlinear SLAM system. This
   results in substantial improvement in the accuracy and consistency of
   the state estimates. The superior performance of the OC-UKF over other
   state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms is validated by both Monte-Carlo
   simulations and real-world experiments.}},

Volume = {{4}},

Abstract = {{Due to its reduced communication overhead and robustness to failures,
   distributed energy management is of paramount importance in smart grids,
   especially in microgrids, which feature distributed generation (DG) and
   distributed storage (DS). Distributed economic dispatch for a microgrid
   with high renewable energy penetration and demand-side management
   operating in grid-connected mode is considered in this paper. To address
   the intrinsically stochastic availability of renewable energy sources
   (RES), a novel power scheduling approach is introduced. The approach
   involves the actual renewable energy as well as the energy traded with
   the main grid, so that the supply-demand balance is maintained. The
   optimal scheduling strategy minimizes the microgrid net cost, which
   includes DG and DS costs, utility of dispatchable loads, and worst-case
   transaction cost stemming from the uncertainty in RES. Leveraging the
   dual decomposition, the optimization problem formulated is solved in a
   distributed fashion by the local controllers of DG, DS, and dispatchable
   loads. Numerical results are reported to corroborate the effectiveness
   of the novel approach.}},

Abstract = {{Background This study examined the impact of transportation
   infrastructure at intersection and non-intersection locations on
   bicycling injury risk.
   Methods In Vancouver and Toronto, we studied adult cyclists who were
   injured and treated at a hospital emergency department. A case-crossover
   design compared the infrastructure of injury and control sites within
   each injured bicyclist's route. Intersection injury sites (N=210) were
   compared to randomly selected intersection control sites (N=272).
   Non-intersection injury sites (N=478) were compared to randomly selected
   non-intersection control sites (N=801).
   Results At intersections, the types of routes meeting and the
   intersection design influenced safety. Intersections of two local
   streets (no demarcated traffic lanes) had approximately one-fifth the
   risk (adjusted OR 0.19, 95\% CI 0.05 to 0.66) of intersections of two
   major streets (more than two traffic lanes). Motor vehicle speeds less
   than 30km/h also reduced risk (adjusted OR 0.52, 95\% CI 0.29 to 0.92).
   Traffic circles (small roundabouts) on local streets increased the risk
   of these otherwise safe intersections (adjusted OR 7.98, 95\% CI 1.79 to
   35.6). At non-intersection locations, very low risks were found for
   cycle tracks (bike lanes physically separated from motor vehicle
   traffic; adjusted OR 0.05, 95\% CI 0.01 to 0.59) and local streets with
   diverters that reduce motor vehicle traffic (adjusted OR 0.04, 95\% CI
   0.003 to 0.60). Downhill grades increased risks at both intersections
   and non-intersections.
   Conclusions These results provide guidance for transportation planners
   and engineers: at local street intersections, traditional stops are
   safer than traffic circles, and at non-intersections, cycle tracks
   alongside major streets and traffic diversion from local streets are
   safer than no bicycle infrastructure.}},

   Part 1. Mean flow and turbulence vorticity}},

Volume = {{733}},
Pages = {{558-587}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Direct numerical simulation is performed to study the effect of
   progressive gravity waves on turbulence underneath. The Navier-Stokes
   equations subject to fully nonlinear kinematic and dynamic free-surface
   boundary conditions are simulated on a surface-following mapped grid
   using a fractional-step scheme with a pseudo-spectral method in the
   horizontal directions and a finite-difference method in the vertical
   direction. To facilitate a mechanistic study that focuses on the
   fundamental physics of wave-turbulence interaction, the wave and
   turbulence fields are set up precisely in the simulation: a
   pressure-forcing method is used to generate and maintain the progressive
   wave being investigated and to suppress other wave components, and a
   random forcing method is used to produce statistically steady,
   homogeneous turbulence in the bulk flow beneath the surface wave. Cases
   with various moderate-to-large turbulence-to-wave time ratios and wave
   steepnesses are considered. Study of the turbulence velocity spectrum
   shows that the turbulence is dynamically forced by the surface wave.
   Mean flow and turbulence vorticity are studied in both the Eulerian and
   Lagrangian frames of the wave. In the Eulerian frame, statistics of the
   underlying turbulence field indicates that the magnitude of turbulence
   vorticity and the inclination angle of vortices are dependent on the
   wave phase. In the Lagrangian frame, wave properties and the
   accumulative effect on turbulence vorticity are studied. It is shown
   that vertical vortices are tilted in the wave propagation direction due
   to the cumulative effects of both the Stokes drift velocity and the
   correlation between turbulence fluctuations and wave strain rate,
   whereas for streamwise vortices, these two factors offset each other and
   result in a negligible tilting effect.}},

   formation mechanisms of CNTs during diesel combustion.
   Implications: Increased attention is being given to CNTs and other
   nanomaterials and a recent review paper showed that CNTs are capable of
   inflammation in the lung when inhaled. For this reason and because
   diesel engines are so common, it is important to acknowledge the
   existence of CNTs among diesel particles and possible regulation and
   online measurement method development.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this research was improving elastomeric seal performance
   based on seal material design. The specific seal failure mode considered
   was permanent deformation or compression set of O-rings, and sealing
   performance degradation due to this process is common to all types of
   elastomeric seals. The basis for seal design was identified as reducing
   the elastic strain energy in the seal since it drives the growth of
   permanent material deformation. The design concept developed was using
   variation of material behavior over the seal section to manipulate the
   level and distribution of elastic strain energy. Design studies used
   finite element analyses with experimentally measured material behavior
   to quantify effects of varying seal material characteristic on seal
   performance. Sealing performance was described in terms of compression
   set and seal-counterface contact pressure. Experimental O-rings were
   produced based on designs that included regions of less stiff material
   in the larger surrounding seal section. Performance of new design seals
   was compared to conventional one-material seals and improved sealing
   performance was demonstrated. With the modified design seals, both
   compression set and the rate of sealing contact pressure loss over time
   were decreased. There was a loss of initial maximum contact pressure
   with the inclusion of less stiff material regions, but it was shown that
   this effect can be mitigated by properly locating the softer material in
   the overall seal section. In summary, properly implemented material
   variations over the seal will result in lower strain energy content,
   lower rate of permanent deformation development and decreasing rate of
   loss of seal-counterface contact pressure.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND Imaging myocardial activation from noninvasive body surface
   potentials promises to aid in both cardiovascular research and clinical
   medicine.
   OBJECTIVE To investigate the ability of a noninvasive 3-dimensional
   cardiac electrical imaging technique for characterizing the activation
   patterns of dynamically changing ventricular arrhythmias during
   drug-induced QT prolongation in rabbits.
   METHODS Simultaneous body surface potential mapping and 3-dimensional
   intracardiac mapping were performed in a closed-chest condition in 8
   rabbits. Data analysis was performed on premature ventricular complexes,
   couplets, and torsades de pointes (TdP) induced during intravenous
   administration of clofilium and phenylephrine with combinations of
   various infusion rates.
   RESULTS The drug infusion Led to a significant increase in the QT
   interval (from 175 +/- 7 to 274 +/- 31 ms) and rate-corrected QT
   interval (from 183 +/- 5 to 262 +/- 21 ms) during the first dose cycle.
   All the ectopic beats initiated by a focal activation pattern. The
   initial beat of TdPs arose at the focal site, whereas the subsequent
   beats were due to focal activity from different sites or 2 competing
   focal sites. The imaged results captured the dynamic shift of activation
   patterns and were in good correlation with the simultaneous
   measurements, with a correlation coefficient of 0.65 +/- 0.02 averaged
   over 111 ectopic beats. Sites of initial activation were localized to be
   5 mm from the directly measured initiation sites.
   CONCLUSIONS The 3-dimensional cardiac electrical imaging technique could
   localize the origin of activation and image activation sequence of TdP
   during QT prolongation induced by clofilium and phenylephrine in
   rabbits. It offers the potential to noninvasively investigate the
   proarrhythmic effects of drug infusion and assess the mechanisms of
   arrhythmias on a beat-to-beat basis.}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{This study develops a spectral theory of the interior transmission
   problem (ITP) for heterogeneous and anisotropic elastic solids. The
   subject is central to the so-called qualitative methods for inverse
   scattering involving penetrable obstacles. Although simply stated as a
   coupled pair of elastodynamic wave equations, the ITP for elastic bodies
   is neither self-adjoint nor elliptic. To help deal with such
   impediments, earlier studies have established the well-posedness of an
   elastodynamic ITP under notably restrictive assumptions on the contrast
   in elastic and mass density parameters between the scatterer and the
   background solid. Due to lack of self-adjointness of the problem, these
   analyses were further successful in substantiating the discreteness of
   the relevant eigenvalue spectrum but not its existence. The aim of this
   work is to provide a systematic treatment of the ITP for elastic bodies
   that transcends the limitations of earlier analyses. Considering a broad
   range of material-contrast configurations, this paper investigates the
   questions of the solvability of the ITP, the discreteness of its
   eigenvalues and, for the first time, of the existence of such eigenvalue
   spectrum. Necessitated by the breadth of material configurations
   studied, the relevant claims are established via a suite of variational
   formulations, each customized to meet the needs of a particular subclass
   of eigenvalue problems.}},

Abstract = {{We studied single neuron dynamics during anoxic depolarizations, which

   depletion was experimentally simulated in slices of rat cortex by
   blocking the sodium-potassium pumps with ouabain. The membrane voltage
   of pyramidal cells was measured. Five different kinds of dynamical
   behavior of the membrane voltage were observed during the resulting
   depolarizations. Using bifurcation analysis of a single cell model, we
   show that these voltage dynamics all are responses of the same cell,
   with normally functioning ion channels, to particular courses of the
   intra- and extracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of hydrolysates from acid
   hydrolysis of four different oil crop biomass residues (OCBR) as low
   cost culture media for algae growth. The one-factor-at-a-time method was
   used to design a series of experiments to optimize the acid hydrolysis
   conditions through examining the total nitrogen, total phosphorus,
   chemical oxygen demand, and ammonia nitrogen in the hydrolysates. The
   optimal conditions were found to be using 3 \% sulfuric acid and
   hydrolyzing residues at 90 A degrees C for 20 h. The hydrolysates (OCBR
   media) produced under the optimal conditions were used to cultivate the
   two algae strains, namely UM258 and UM268. The results from 5 days of
   cultivation showed that the OCBR media supported faster algae growth
   with maximal algal biomass yield of 2.7 and 3 g/L, respectively.
   Moreover, the total lipids for UM258 and UM268 were 54 and 35 \%,
   respectively, after 5 days of cultivation, which suggested that the OCBR
   media allowed the algae strains to accumulate higher lipids probably due
   to high C/N ratio. Furthermore, over 3 \% of omega-3 fatty acid (EPA)
   was produced for the two algae strains. In conclusion, OCBR media are
   excellent alternative for algae growth and have a great potential for
   large-scale production of algae-based ingredients for biodiesel as well
   as high-value food and pharmaceutical products.}},

Abstract = {{Interest in the mechanisms of wood-degrading fungi has grown in tandem
   with lignocellulose bioconversion efforts, yet many potential biomass
   feedstocks are non-woody. Using corn stover (Zea mays) as a substrate,
   we tracked degradative capacities among brown rot fungi from the
   Antrodia clade, including Postia placenta, the first brown rot fungus to
   have its genome sequenced. Decay dynamics were compared against
   Gloeophyllum trabeum from the Gloeophyllum clade. Weight loss induced by
   P. placenta (6.2 \%) and five other Antrodia clade isolates (average 7.4
   \%) on corn stalk after 12 weeks demonstrated inefficiency among these
   fungi, relative to decay induced by G. trabeum (44.4 \%). Using aspen
   (Populus sp.) as a woody substrate resulted in, on average, a fourfold
   increase in weight loss induced by Antrodia clade fungi, while G.
   trabeum results matched those on stover. The sequence and trajectories
   of chemical constituent losses differed as a function of substrate but
   not fungal clade. Instead, chemical data suggest that characters unique
   to stover limit decay by the Antrodia clade, rather than disparities in
   growth rate or extractives toxicity. High p-coumaryl lignin content,
   lacking the methoxy groups characteristically cleaved during brown rot,
   is among potential rate-distinguishing characters in grasses. This
   ineptitude among Antrodia clade fungi on grasses was supported by
   meta-analysis of other unrelated studies using grass substrates.
   Concerning application, results expose a problem if adopting the
   strategy of the model decay fungus P. placenta to treat corn stover, a
   widely available plant feedstock. Overall, the results insinuate
   phylogenetically distinct modes of brown rot and demonstrate the benefit
   of using non-woody substrates to probe wood degradation mechanisms.}},

   gelation conditions, making it challenging to compare between models.
   This work reviews existing models of endothelial assembly in fibrin gel
   and posits that differerences between models are partially caused by
   microstructural differences in fibrin gel. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{In a wireless system with a large number of distributed nodes, the
   quality of communication can be greatly improved by pooling the nodes to
   perform joint transmission/reception. In this paper, we consider the
   problem of optimally selecting a subset of nodes from potentially a
   large number of candidates to form a virtual multi-antenna system, while
   at the same time designing their joint linear transmission strategies.
   We focus on two specific application scenarios: 1) multiple single
   antenna transmitters cooperatively transmit to a receiver; 2) a single
   transmitter transmits to a receiver with the help of a number of
   cooperative relays. We formulate the joint node selection and
   beamforming problems as cardinality constrained optimization problems
   with both discrete variables (used for selecting cooperative nodes) and
   continuous variables (used for designing beamformers). For each
   application scenario, we first characterize the computational complexity
   of the joint optimization problem, and then propose novel semi-definite
   relaxation (SDR) techniques to obtain approximate solutions. We show
   that the new SDR algorithms have a guaranteed approximation performance
   in terms of the gap to global optimality, regardless of channel
   realizations. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is
   demonstrated via numerical experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last 50 years, a steady stream of accounts have been written on
   the separation principle of stochastic control. Even in the context of
   the linear-quadratic regulator in continuous time with Gaussian white
   noise, subtle difficulties arise, unexpected by many, that are often
   overlooked. In this paper we propose a new framework for establishing
   the separation principle. This approach takes the viewpoint that
   stochastic systems are well-defined maps between sample paths rather
   than stochastic processes per se and allows us to extend the separation
   principle to systems driven by martingales with possible jumps. While
   the approach is more in line with ``real-life{''} engineering thinking
   where signals travel around the feedback loop, it is unconventional from
   a probabilistic point of view in that control laws for which the
   feedback equations are satisfied almost surely, and not
   deterministically for every sample path, are excluded.}},

Abstract = {{Areal-time dual-mode ultrasound array (DMUA) system for imaging and
   therapy is described. The system utilizes a concave (40-mm radius of
   curvature) 3.5 MHz, 32 element array, and modular multichannel
   transmitter/receiver. The system is capable of operating in a variety of
   imaging and therapy modes (on transmit) and continuous receive on all
   array elements even during high-power operation. A signal chain
   consisting of field-programmable gate arrays and graphical processing
   units is used to enable real time, software-defined beamforming and
   image formation. Imaging data, from quality assurance phantoms as well
   as in vivo small-and large-animal models, are presented and discussed.
   Corresponding images obtained using a temporally-synchronized and
   spatially-aligned diagnostic probe confirm the DMUA's ability to form
   anatomically-correct images with sufficient contrast in an extended
   field of view around its geometric center. In addition, high-frame rate
   DMUA data also demonstrate the feasibility of detection and localization
   of echo changes indicative of cavitation and/or tissue boiling during
   high-intensity focused ultrasound exposures with 45-50 dB dynamic range.
   The results also show that the axial and lateral resolution of the DMUA
   are consistent with its f(number) and bandwidth with well-behaved
   speckle cell characteristics. These results point the way to a
   theranostic DMUA system capable of quantitative imaging of tissue
   property changes with high specificity to lesion formation using focused
   ultrasound.}},

Title = {{The unipolar diffusion charging of arbitrary shaped aerosol particles}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{60-80}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The unipolar diffusion charging of particles, i.e. the net increase in
   particle charge through ion-particle collisions, is an important process
   in a number of aerosol systems. Accurate methods are hence needed to
   predict the unipolar charging rate, not only for spherical particles,
   but also particles of arbitrary geometry. In this work, the unipolar
   charging (described by the particle-ion collision kernel) of conducting,
   arbitrary shaped particles is studied theoretically. Through a
   combination of dimensional analysis, Brownian dynamics (BD), and
   molecular dynamics (MD), the collision kernel is found to be described
   accurately by a simple-to-use expression across the entire diffusive
   Knudsen number Kn(D) range (from the continuum regime to the free
   molecular regime), where Kn(D) is the ratio of the ion mean persistence
   path to a well-defined particle length scale (proportional to the ratio
   of orientationally averaged projected area PA to the Smoluchowski radius
   R-s). In the developed collision kernel expression, the effect of
   repulsive Coulomb and attractive image potential interactions between
   the ion and the particle are parameterized by the coulomb potential
   energy to thermal energy ratio, psi(E) and image potential energy to
   thermal energy ratio, psi(I). It is found that the changes in collision
   rates due to potential interactions in the continuum (KnD -> 0) and free
   molecular (KnD ->infinity) regimes collapse to particle geometry
   independent functions, expressed in terms of psi(E) and psi(I). In the
   transition regime, the dimensionless collision kernel H is shown to be
   geometry independent, and is a function of a suitably defined Kn(D)
   only. Comparison is made between the predictions of the proposed
   expression and the flux matching model of Fuchs; for non-spherical
   particles, theories available in the literature are examined and
   commented upon. Finally, sample calculations of the mean charge acquired
   by selected particle geometries are presented and discussed. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) enable targeted

   and their broad targeting range. Here we report the assembly of several
   TALENs for a specific genomic locus in barley. The cleavage activity of
   individual TALENs was first tested in vivo using a yeast-based,
   single-strand annealing assay. The most efficient TALEN was then
   selected for barley transformation. Analysis of the resulting
   transformants showed that TALEN-induced double strand breaks led to the
   introduction of short deletions at the target site. Additional analysis
   revealed that each barley transformant contained a range of different
   mutations, indicating that mutations occurred independently in different
   cells.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is found in
   9.5 percent of the U.S. population and poses lifelong challenges.
   Current diagnostic approaches rely on evaluation forms completed by
   teachers and/or parents, although they are not specifically trained to
   recognize cognitive disorders. The most accurate diagnosis is by a
   psychiatrist, often only available to children with severe symptoms.
   Development of a tool that is engaging and objective and aids medical
   providers is needed in the diagnosis of ADHD. The goal of this research
   is to work toward the development of such a tool.
   Materials and Methods: The proposed approach takes advantage of two
   trends: The rapid adoption of tangible user interface devices and the
   popularity of interactive videogames. CogCubed Inc. (Minneapolis, MN)
   has created ``Groundskeeper,'' a game on the Sifteo Cubes (Sifteo, Inc.,
   San Francisco, CA) game system with elements that exercise skills
   affected by ADHD. ``Groundskeeper'' was evaluated for 52 patients, with
   and without ADHD. Gameplay data were mathematically transformed into
   ADHD-indicative feature variables and subjected to machine learning
   algorithms to develop diagnostic models to aid psychiatric clinical
   assessments of ADHD. The effectiveness of the developed model was
   evaluated against the diagnostic impressions of two licensed
   child/adolescent psychiatrists using semistructured interviews.
   Results: Our predictive algorithms were highly accurate in correctly
   predicting diagnoses based on gameplay of ``Groundskeeper.'' The
   F-measure, a measure of diagnosis accuracy, from the predictive models
   gave values as follows: ADHD, inattentive type, 78 percent (P > 0.05);
   ADHD, combined type, 75 percent (P < 0.05); anxiety disorders, 71\%; and
   depressive disorders, 76\%.
   Conclusions: This represents a promising new approach to screening tools
   for ADHD.}},

Title = {{The effect of surfactant redistribution on combined gravitational and
   thermocapillary interactions of deformable drops}},
Journal = {{ACTA ASTRONAUTICA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{91}},
Pages = {{55-68}},
Month = {{OCT-NOV}},
Abstract = {{Trajectories are calculated by the boundary-integral method for two
   contaminated deformable drops under the combined influence of buoyancy
   and a constant temperature gradient at low Reynolds number and with
   negligible thermal convection. The surfactant is bulk-insoluble, and its
   coverage is determined by solution of the time-dependent
   convective-diffusion equation. Two limits are considered. For small
   drops, the deformation is small, and thermocapillary and buoyant effects
   are of the same order of magnitude. In this case, comparison is made
   with incompressible surfactant results to determine when surfactant
   redistribution becomes important. Convection of surfactant can lead to
   elimination of interesting features, such as the possibility of two
   different-sized drops migrating with fixed separation and orientation,
   and can increase the difference between the drops velocities. For larger
   drops, deformation can be significant, leading to smaller or larger drop
   breakup, and buoyant motion dominates thermocapillarity. In this case,
   convection of surfactant can increase deformation and offset previously
   observed inhibition of breakup for clean drops when the driving forces
   are opposed. This effect is less pronounced for larger size ratios. By
   extension, redistribution of surfactant can enhance
   deformation-increasing tendencies seen with driving forces aligned in
   the same direction. (C) 2013 IAA. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{We carry out high-resolution laboratory experiments and numerical
   simulations to investigate the dynamics of unsteady vortex formation
   across the neck of an anatomic in vitro model of an intracranial
   aneurysm. A transparent acrylic replica of the aneurysm is manufactured
   and attached to a pulse duplicator system in the laboratory.
   Time-resolved three-dimensional three-component velocity measurements
   are obtained inside the aneurysm sac under physiologic pulsatile
   conditions. High-resolution numerical simulations are also carried out
   under conditions replicating as closely as possible those of the
   laboratory experiment. Comparison of the measured and computed flow
   fields shows very good agreement in terms of instantaneous velocity
   fields and three-dimensional coherent structures. Both experiments and
   numerical simulations show that a well-defined vortical structure is
   formed near the proximal neck at early systole. This vortical structure
   is advected by the flow across the aneurysm neck and impinges on the
   distal wall. The results underscore the complexity of aneurysm
   hemodynamics and point to the need for integrating high-resolution,
   time-resolved three-dimensional experimental and computational
   techniques. The current work emphasizes the importance of vortex
   formation phenomena at aneurysmal necks and reinforces the findings of
   previous computational work and recent clinical studies pointing to
   links between flow pulsatility and aneurysm growth and rupture.}},

Abstract = {{Aircraft pitot-static probes are essential to airspeed and altitude
   measurements and safe flight. Measurement integrity is typically
   achieved via sensor hardware redundancy and a voting system. Hardware
   redundancy imposes a cost and payload penalty. This paper investigates
   an analytical alternative to hardware redundancy requiring a
   mathematical model of faulted and unfaulted pitotstatic probes. The most
   common probe faults-debris, ice, or water blockages-are modeled using
   physical air data relationships and experimental wind tunnel data. These
   models are used with a linear model of the NASA GTM aircraft at one
   flight condition to design robust fault detection filters. Two linear
   H-infinity filters are designed to detect faults, reject disturbances,
   and provide robustness to model errors. Performance is evaluated using
   experimentally derived fault models with nonlinear aircraft simulations
   that incorporate actuator uncertainty. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Well-balanced workload among wireless access points (APs) in a wireless
   local-area network (WLAN) can improve the user experience for accessing
   the Internet. Most load balancing solutions in WLANs focuses on the
   optimization of AP operations, assuming that the arrivals and departures
   of users are independent. However, through the analysis of AP usage
   based on a real WLAN trace of one-month collected at the Shanghai Jiao
   Tong University (SJTU), we find that such an assumption does not hold.
   In fact, due to users' social activities which is particularly time for
   enterprise environments, they tend to arrive or leave in unison, which
   would disruptively affect the load balance among APs. In this paper, we
   propose a novel AP allocation scheme to tackle the load balancing
   problem in WLANs, taking into account the social relationships of users.
   In this scheme, users with intense social relationships are assigned to
   different APs so that jointly departure of those users would have minor
   impact on the load balance of APs. Given that the problem of allocating
   an AP for each user so that the average of the sums of social relation
   intensity between any pair of users in each AP is NP-complete, we
   propose an online greedy algorithm. Extensive trace-driven simulations
   demonstrate the efficacy of our scheme. Comparing to the
   state-of-the-art method, we can achieve about 64.7 percent balancing
   performance gain on average during peak hours in workdays.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between vitreous
   temperature and posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). 30 porcine eyes
   were hemisected to form eyecups. In 10 eyes, the vitreous was warmed to
   37 +/- 1 degrees C for 1 min and cooled down to room temperature. In 10
   eyes, the vitreous was warmed to 44 +/- 1 degrees C for 1 min and cooled
   down to room temperature. 10 eyes were kept at room temperature. The
   vitreous was then removed surgically by forceps. In the eyes that were
   kept at room temperature (n=10), and in the eyes that the vitreous was
   warmed to 37 +/- 1 degrees C (n=10), the vitreous removal caused
   significant retinal damage, detachment and fold, and choroidal
   detachment. In the eyes that the vitreous was warmed to 44 +/- 1 degrees
   C (n=10), the vitreous removal did not cause any observable changes in
   the retina and choroid. Therefore, the vitreous separates from the
   retina after warming to 44 +/- 1 degrees C. The effect is likely
   irreversible through vitreous liquefaction. Thermal effect might have
   caused PVD in some patients. Since cell death occurs at above 55-58
   degrees C, the effect can potentially be safe and beneficial in surgical
   separation of the vitreous. Evidence is provided to show that this
   technique could be safely performed in vivo in humans, and that it would
   lead to safer removal of the vitreous during vitrectomy with fewer
   post-operative complications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A compact 5.5-GHz band pass filter (BPF) with 12.7\% 3-dB bandwidth is
   developed in an all silicon multilayer substrate with air dielectric
   incorporated for WiMax applications. The topology of the BPF is a
   capacitively coupled fifth-order Chebyshev BPF. Its volume is 9.3 x 8.5
   x 0.6 mm(3). Two design aspects-air dielectric and through silicon via
   (TSV) technology integration-play an essential role in the BPF
   implementation. The spiral inductor with an integrated air dielectric
   has quality factor and self-resonant frequency improvement of 112 and
   41\%, respectively. The TSVs in the BPF design enables the
   implementation of two-layer inductors with a low value of inductance.
   The volume of TSV in the two-layer inductor is 75 3 75 3 200 mu m(3) and
   its inductance is 0.15 nH at 5 GHz. (C) 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{We develop mathematical framework and computational tools for
   calculating frequency responses of linear time-invariant PDEs in which
   an independent spatial variable belongs to a compact interval. In
   conventional studies this computation is done numerically using spatial
   discretization of differential operators in the evolution equation. In
   this paper, we introduce an alternative method that avoids the need for
   finite-dimensional approximation of the underlying operators in the
   evolution model. This method recasts the frequency response operator as
   a two point boundary value problem and uses state-of-the-art automatic
   spectral collocation techniques for solving integral representations of
   the resulting boundary value problems with accuracy comparable to
   machine precision. Our approach has two advantages over currently
   available schemes: first, it avoids numerical instabilities encountered
   in systems with differential operators of high order and, second, it
   alleviates difficulty in implementing boundary conditions. We provide
   examples from Newtonian and viscoelastic fluid dynamics to illustrate
   utility of the proposed method. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{10}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Accurate detection of the danger of an impending rollover is necessary
   in order to effectively use active vehicle rollover prevention. A
   real-time rollover index is an indicator used for this purpose. A
   traditional rollover index utilizes lateral acceleration measurements
   and can detect only untripped rollovers that happen due to high lateral
   acceleration from a sharp turn. It fails to detect tripped rollovers
   that happen due to tripping from external inputs such as forces when a
   vehicle strikes a curb or a road bump. Therefore, this paper develops a
   new rollover index that can detect both tripped and untripped rollovers.
   The new rollover index utilizes vertical accelerometers in addition to a
   lateral accelerometer and is able to predict rollover in spite of
   unknown external inputs acting on the system. The accuracy of the
   developed rollover index is evaluated through simulations with
   industry-standard software CARSIM and experimental tests on a
   one-eighth-scaled vehicle. In order to show that the scaled vehicle
   experiments can represent a full-sized vehicle, the Buckingham pi
   theorem is used to show dynamic similarity. The simulation and
   experimental results show that the new rollover index can reliably
   detect both tripped and untripped rollovers.}},

Title = {{Cost impact of dynamically managing generation reserves}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL POWER \& ENERGY SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{51}},
Pages = {{292-297}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Generation reserves are needed to maintain the real time balance between
   power supply and power demand. Because power is noninventoriable, power
   generation follows power demand. Demand for power varies considerably
   depending on the time of day, day of the week and season. The
   predictable portion of power demand is met by purchasing firm energy on
   a day ahead or real time market. The random unpredictable portion of
   demand is met by purchasing a set of online and offline generation
   reserves on an ancillary market. The total energy purchasing cost
   includes payments for firm energy and payments for generation reserves.
   The latter include fixed capacity payments for reserve generation
   capacities and variable payments for the random energy produced from
   these reserves. The main contribution of this paper is to present an
   optimization model that captures the dynamism in the selection of the
   dispatch interval to determine the amount of firm energy and reserve
   capacities given a set of market prices. This is done by explicitly
   including in the model the duration of the dispatch period and the
   frequency this decision is reevaluated. In this model the randomness of
   the demand is captured by using a Doubly Truncated Normal Distribution.
   The cost incurred to activate generation reserves is modeled as a
   Poisson process. The total model captures the price differences from
   using different reserve sources. An empirical example is presented to
   illustrate the cost benefits of using the method proposed in this
   research with two different strategies: a static strategy and a dynamic
   strategy. It is shown that dynamically setting generation reserves
   results in cost savings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{To develop mechanically improved polylactide (PLA)-based sustainable
   polymers, a series of poly(lactide-b-butadiene) (PLA-PB) multiblock
   copolymers were synthesized in a two-step procedure: PLA-PB-PLA (LBL)
   triblock copolymers were prepared using ring-opening polymerization of
   D,L-lactide, followed by chain extension of LBL triblock polymers with
   toluene-2,4-diisocyanate (TDI) and terephthaloyl chloride (TCl).
   Molecular characterization revealed that the synthetic procedures
   yielded the desired triblock and multiblock copolymers with a
   composition range of 0.5 <= f(PLA) <= 0.9. Differential scanning
   calorimetry (DSC), small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) demonstrated nearly identical, well-ordered,
   morphologies in the homologous triblock and multiblock copolymer
   materials, in sharp contrast with the findings of a recent study
   involving poly(styrene-b-butadiene) (PS-PB) multiblock polymers. These
   results indicate a transition from classically ordered morphologies to a
   state of bicontinuous disorder for multiblocks containing < n'> >= 10,
   where < n'> is the average total number of blocks. Lamellae (f(PLA) =
   0.6) and cylinder (f(PLA), = 0.7 and 0.8) forming PLA-PB multiblock
   copolymers exhibited dramatically enhanced mechanical properties
   compared to the corresponding LBL triblock copolymers. However, this
   toughening effect was not evident in samples containing a spherical
   morphology (f(PLA) = 0.9). These findings demonstrate a commercially
   viable approach to preparing sustainable plastics with competitive
   mechanical properties.}},

Abstract = {{Background: According to the World Health organization, half the world's
   population is at risk of contracting malaria. They estimated that in
   2010 there were 219 million cases of malaria, resulting in 660,000
   deaths and an enormous economic burden on the countries where malaria is
   endemic. The adoption of various high-throughput genomics-based
   techniques by malaria researchers has meant that new avenues to the
   study of this disease are being explored and new targets for controlling
   the disease are being developed. Here, we apply a novel neighborhood
   subnetwork alignment approach to identify the interacting elements that
   help regulate the cell cycle of the malaria parasite Plasmodium
   falciparum.
   Results: Our novel subnetwork alignment approach was used to compare
   networks in Escherichia coli and P. falciparum. Some 574 P. falciparum
   proteins were revealed as functional orthologs of known cell cycle
   proteins in E. coli. Over one third of these predicted functional
   orthologs were annotated as ``conserved Plasmodium proteins{''} or
   ``putative uncharacterized proteins{''} of unknown function. The
   predicted functionalities included cyclins, kinases, surface antigens,
   transcriptional regulators and various functions related to DNA
   replication, repair and cell division.
   Conclusions: The results of our analysis demonstrate the power of our
   subnetwork alignment approach to assign functionality to previously
   unannotated proteins. Here, the focus was on proteins involved in cell
   cycle regulation. These proteins are involved in the control of diverse
   aspects of the parasite lifecycle and of important aspects of
   pathogenesis.}},

   to defects. To better understand this phenomenon, we model the leveling
   of thin liquid films subject to electrohydrodynamic forces. We consider
   cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous substrate charge distributions
   and contamination of the film surface by free charge. The liquid is
   assumed to be Newtonian, both perfect dielectric and leaky dielectric
   materials are considered, and lubrication theory is employed. Linear
   stability analysis and nonlinear simulations reveal different leveling
   criteria for small- and large amplitude perturbations to the film
   surface. Heterogeneous charge distributions on the substrate are found
   to lead to steady curved interface shapes. Using asymptotic methods, we
   develop analytical expressions to predict these shapes, and
   consequently, the magnitude of coating defects. We also employ transient
   nonlinear simulations track the leveling of disturbances created by
   contamination of the film surface by free charge. The results of our
   study enable us to propose simple heuristics for determining the
   conditions under which coatings subject to electrohydrodynamic forces
   will level. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Rapid Annealing of Polycrystalline Domains}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS}},

Volume = {{111}},

Month = {{SEP 19}},
Abstract = {{Colloids are known to form planar, hexagonal closed packed (hcp)
   crystals near electrodes in response to electrohydrodynamic (EHD) flow.
   Previous work has established that the EHD velocity increases as the
   applied ac frequency decreases. Here we report the existence of an
   order-to-disorder transition at sufficiently low frequencies, despite
   the increase in the attractive EHD driving force. At large frequencies
   (similar to 500 Hz), spherical micron-scale particles form hcp crystals;
   as the frequency is decreased below similar to 250 Hz, however, the
   crystalline structure transitions to randomly closed packed (rcp). The
   transition is reversible and second order with respect to frequency, and
   independent measurements of the EHD aggregation rate confirm that the
   EHD driving force is indeed higher at the lower frequencies. We present
   evidence that the transition is instead caused by an increased particle
   diffusivity due to increased particle height over the electrode at lower
   frequencies, and we demonstrate that the hcp-rcp transition facilitates
   rapid annealing of polycrystalline domains.}},

Abstract = {{The aqueous solubility (log S) of xenobiotic chemicals has been
   identified as a key characteristic in determining their
   bioaccessibility/bioavailability and their fate and transport in aquatic
   environments. We here explore and evaluate the use of a state-of-the-art
   data analysis technique (Project to Latent Structures, PLS) to estimate
   log S of environmentally relevant chemicals. A large number (n = 624) of
   molecular descriptors was computed for over 1400 organic chemicals, and
   then refined by a feature selection technique. Candidate predictor
   descriptors were fitted to data by means of PLS, which was optimized by
   an internal leave-one-out cross-validation technique and validated by an
   external data set. The final (best) PLS model with only four variables
   (AlogP, X1sol, Mv, and E) exhibited noteworthy stability and good
   predictive power. It was able to explain 91\% of the data (n = 1400)
   variance with an average absolute error of 0.5 log units through the
   solubilities span over 12 orders of magnitude. The newly proposed model
   is transparent, easily portable from one user to another, and robust
   enough to accurately estimate log S of a wide range of emerging
   contaminants. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Direct observation of an unexpected product from excited state fusion of

   Transient spectroscopy was used to identify the product as a metal

   fusion. The reaction was demonstrated to be second order with a rate
   coefficient of k(TTF) = (5.4 +/- 0.4) x 10(-10) cm(3) . s(-1). The
   results contrast with the common assumption that fusion proceeds
   directly to annihilation via rapid non-radiative deactivation of the
   products. Following visible photo-excitation, the fusion process results
   in energetic upconversion of the incident photons stored in the higher
   energy (d, d) state at irradiances below the threshold for multi-photon

Abstract = {{Background-Thymosin beta 4 (T beta 4) has been shown to enhance the
   survival of cultured cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated whether the
   cytoprotective effects of T beta 4 can increase the effectiveness of
   transplanted swine mesenchymal stem cells (sMSCs) for cardiac repair in
   a rat model of myocardial infarction (MI).
   Methods and Results-Under hypoxic conditions, cellular damage (lactate
   dehydrogenase leakage), apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase
   dUTP nick end labelingc cells), and caspase-8 activity were
   significantly lower, whereas B-cell lymphoma-extra large protein
   expression was significantly higher, in sMSCs cultured with T beta 4 (1
   mu g/mL) than in sMSCs cultured without T beta 4, and T beta 4 also
   increased sMSC proliferation. For in vivo experiments, animals were
   treated with basal medium (MI: n=6), a fibrin patch (Patch: n=6), a
   patch containing sMSCs (sMSC: n=9), or a patch containing sMSCs and T
   beta 4 (sMSC/T beta 4: n=11); T beta 4 was encapsulated in gelatin
   microspheres to extend T beta 4 delivery. Four weeks after treatment,
   echocardiographic assessments of left-ventricular ejection fraction and
   fractional shortening were significantly better (P<0.05) in sMSC/T beta
   4 animals (left-ventricular ejection fraction=51.7 +/- 1.1\%; fractional
   shortening=26.7 +/- 0.7\%) than in animals from MI (39 +/- 3\%; 19.5 +/-
   1.7\%) and Patch (43 +/- 1.4\%; 21.6 +/- 0.9\%) groups. Histological
   assessment of infarct wall thickness was significantly higher (P<0.05)
   in sMSC/T beta 4 animals (50\%, {[}45\%, 80\%]) than in animals from MI
   (25\%, {[}20\%, 25\%]) group. Measurements in sMSC (left-ventricular
   ejection fraction=45 +/- 2.6\%; fractional shortening=22.9 +/- 1.6\%;
   TH=43\% {[}25\%, 45\%]), Patch, and MI animals were similar. T beta 4
   administration also significantly increased vascular growth, the
   retention/survival of the transplanted sMSCs, and the recruitment of
   endogenous c-Kit(+) progenitor cells to the infarcted region.
   Conclusions-Extended-release T beta 4 administration improves the
   retention, survival, and regenerative potency of transplanted sMSCs
   after myocardial injury.}},

   Pyr = pyrrolide; OHMT=O-2,6-Mesityl(2)C(6)H(3)) is greater than the rate
   of polymerization by Mo(N-t-Bu)(CH-t-Bu)(Pyr)(OHMT) (1b), but both gave
   the same cis,HT polymer structures. Formation of HT-poly(3-RCOE)
   employing 1c takes place via propagating species in which the R group
   (methyl, hexyl, or phenyl) is on C2 of the propagating alkylidene chain,
   a type of intermediate that has been modeled through the preparation of
   W(N-t-Bu)(CHCHMeEt)(Pyr)(OHMT). The rate of ROMP is exceedingly
   sensitive to steric factors: e.g., W(N-t-Bu)(CH-t-Bu)(Me(2)Pyr)(OHMT),
   the dimethylpyrrolide analogue of 1c, essentially did not polymerize
   3-HexCOE at 22 degrees C. When a sample of
   W(N-t-Bu)(CHCHMeEt)(Pyr)(OHMT) and 3-methyl-1-pentene in CDCl3 is cooled
   to -20 degrees C, the alkylidene resonances for
   W(N-t-Bu)(CHCHMeEt)(Pyr)(OHMT) disappear and resonances that can be
   ascribed to protons in a syn(alpha)/syn(alpha') disubstituted trigonal
   bipyramidal metallacyclobutane complex appear. 3-Methyl-1-pentene is
   readily lost from this metallacycle on the NMR time scale at room
   temperature.}},
