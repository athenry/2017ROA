Abstract = {{A novel thermal sensor is designed and fabricated based on spin-transfer
   torque operated magnetic tunnel junction (STT-MTJ) device. It can
   fulfill thermal detection and overheat protection on integrated circuit.
   Moreover, it shows over 10 times faster thermal transit response speed
   than that of traditional CMOS thermal sensor. The unique property is
   really helpful for controlling integrated circuit's temperature due to
   heating by leakage current. A power driver at full loading situation is
   used to demonstrate this design. It shows that the sensor can be adopted
   as adaptive manner in a power source scaling strategy to cool down the
   IC in an effective way, showing a promising potential application not
   only as discrete sensor, but also as power solution for IC driver.}},

Abstract = {{Sensing of acetone using the quantum capacitance in graphene is
   demonstrated. The sensor was constructed by using graphene as the top
   electrode in a metal-oxide-graphene variable capacitor (varactor)

   acetone concentration with a relative capacitance sensitivity, Delta C/C
   of 1.29 +/- 0.04 x 10(-4) \% / ppmv. The sensor was also found to have
   3x enhanced sensitivity in dry air compared to N-2 and showed excellent

Abstract = {{We present here a scalable protocol for transaction management in
   key-value based multi-version data storage systems supporting partial
   replication of data in cloud and cluster computing environments. We
   consider here systems in which the database is sharded into partitions,
   a partition is replicated only at a subset of the nodes in the system,
   and no node contains all partitions. The protocol presented here is
   based on the Partitioned Causal Snapshot Isolation (PCSI) model and it
   enhances the scalability of that model. The PCSI protocol is scalable
   for update transactions which involve updating of only local partitions.
   However, it faces scalability limitations when transactions update
   non-local partitions. This limitation stems from the scheme used for
   obtaining update timestamps for remote partitions, causing vector clocks
   to grow with the system configuration size. We present here a new
   protocol based on the notion of sequence number escrow and address the
   underlying technical problems. Our experimental evaluations show that
   this protocol scales out almost linearly when workloads involve
   transactions with remote partition updates. We present here the
   performance of this protocol for three different workloads with varying
   mix of transaction characteristics.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we analyze a novel sampling technique that addresses the
   clock jitter problem in high resolution wideband ADCs. The proposed
   sampler shapes the jitter-induced error in a manner similar to Delta
   Sigma ADC, which normally shapes the quantization noise. The clock
   jitter at the sampler is suppressed by the loop filter, and the impact
   of feedback pulse jitter is reduced through use of switched-capacitor
   feedback. As opposed to prior studies, we show that the Delta Sigma
   sampler suppresses the jitter error by more than 10X even at low OSR. As
   an example, a 2nd-order Delta Sigma sampler increases the SJNR by 22 dB
   at OSR= 5, corresponding to more than 3-bit improvement in the
   achievable SNR. Analysis indicates that increasing the loop order and/or
   OSR improves the amount of jitter suppression. In addition, the Delta
   Sigma sampler provides the clock programmable antialiasing properties of
   an integration sampler. The analysis was validated via macro-model
   simulations in MATLAB and circuit simulation in Cadence.}},

Title = {{Modelling and experimental validation of the displacement of a check

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FLUID POWER}},

Pages = {{114-124}},
Abstract = {{A variety of methods have previously been applied to modelling hydraulic
   check valves. While the theoretical framework has been established,
   robust experimental validation of check valve models is lacking. When
   present, validation methods typically rely on measurements of pressure
   differential or flow rates, from which check valve dynamics are
   inferred. In this paper, a lumped parameter model is constructed for a
   disc style check valve used to control the inlet and outlet flow of a
   piston pump. Pressure, spring, contact, stiction, and flow forces are
   investigated to determine which have a significant effect on the check
   valve dynamics. An experimental pump circuit is constructed and an
   acrylic sight glass is installed on the check valve manifolds. A method
   of directly measuring the check valve position during operation using a
   Laser Triangulation Sensor (LTS) is developed by applying Snell's law to
   the air-acrylic and acrylic-oil interfaces and calculating laser
   refraction to obtain a relationship between valve position and LTS
   voltage output. Modelled valve position and flow rates are compared to
   experimental data for three sets of operating conditions - baseline,
   high speed, and high pressure. In all three cases, modelled inlet and
   delivery valve displacement closely agree with experimental
   measurements. Error between predicted and measured flow rates is less
   than 3\% for all cases.}},

Abstract = {{In previous work, we have introduced a contract-based realizability
   checking algorithm for assume-guarantee contracts involving infinite
   theories, such as linear integer/real arithmetic and uninterpreted
   functions over infinite domains. This algorithm can determine whether or
   not it is possible to construct a realization (i.e. an implementation)
   of an assume guarantee contract. The algorithm is similar to k-induction
   model checking, but involves the use of quantifiers to determine
   implementability.
   While our work on realizability is inherently useful for virtual
   integration in determining whether it is possible for suppliers to build
   software that meets a contract, it also provides the foundations to
   solving the more challenging problem of component synthesis. In this
   paper, we provide an initial synthesis algorithm for assume-guarantee
   contracts involving infinite theories. To do so, we take advantage of
   our realizability checking procedure and a skolemization solver for
   VS-formulas, called AE-VAL. We show that it is possible to immediately
   adapt our existing algorithm towards synthesis by using this solver,
   using a demonstration example. We then discuss challenges towards
   creating a more robust synthesis algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis of behavior using video is a promising approach for identifying
   risk markers for psychopathology that can be applied in a wide range of
   populations. As part of a study on the environmental factors that relate
   to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) behaviors, videos were recorded
   of everyday tasks being performed by two groups of children: a control
   group and a group diagnosed with OCD. One of the activities involved
   handwashing, since handwashing compulsions are frequent amongst those
   who suffer from OCD. Being able to classify these handwashing videos as
   showing behaviors associated with OCD or not is a step towards helping
   to automate important aspects of this psychiatric study.
   This paper explores using various feature descriptors sampled from dense
   motion trajectories to determine which combination of features and
   encodings would be best for video classification. Dense motion
   trajectories are computed for the videos from the OCD study and the
   points in these trajectories are described using several methods,
   including histograms of oriented gradient, histograms of optical flow,
   and motion boundary histograms. Various encoding techniques for these
   descriptors are also explored, including bag of words, pyramid bag of
   words, and sparse coding. To determine which feature/encoding techniques
   would perform the best, several dimensionality reduction techniques are
   used and the methods are ranked based on separability in the low
   dimensional space. This separability is measured by classifying using a
   linear discriminant and also by using kNN.}},

   using the same methodology. Indeed, thanks to a new and judicious use of
   the Young's relation, additional degree of freedoms are included in the
   LMI, contrarily to some recent results, which turn to be particular
   cases of what we proposed in this paper. This additional decision
   variables allow to improve the feasibility of the proposed LMI. A

Abstract = {{Wind turbines in a wind farm operate individually to maximize their own
   power regardless of the impact of aerodynamic interactions on
   neighboring turbines. There is the potential to increase power and
   reduce overall structural loads by properly coordinating turbines. To
   perform control design and analysis, a model needs to be of low
   computational cost, but retains the necessary dynamics seen in
   high-fidelity models. The objective of this work is to obtain a
   reduced-order model that represents the full-order flow computed using a
   high-fidelity model. A variety of methods, including proper orthogonal
   decomposition and dynamic mode decomposition, can be used to extract the
   dominant flow structures and obtain a reduced-order model. In this
   paper, we combine proper orthogonal decomposition with a system
   identification technique to produce an input-output reduced-order model.
   This technique is used to construct a reduced-order model of the flow
   within a two-turbine array computed using a large-eddy simulation.}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of using control actions to communicate is called
   signaling. Signaling is often beneficial in decentralized control
   problems with imperfect communication between agents. Seemingly simple
   control problems with signaling are often mathematically challenging.
   Humans, however, lack high-speed communication channels and routinely
   employ signaling strategies during cooperative movements. This paper
   presents a computationally tractable two-player problem that models
   several salient features of signaling problems arising in both
   decentralized control and human experiments. The problem consists of a
   signaler that reaches towards one of two possible targets, and an
   observer that decides on the target location based on noisy measurements
   of the movement. The signaler trades off control costs, such as energy,
   with informa-tiveness for the observer. Two variants, the unambiguous
   case and the ambiguous case, are presented. In the unambiguous case, the
   signaler makes movements that are easy to distinguish, while in the
   ambiguous case, the signaler maximizes similarity of the movements. An
   approximation method for nonlinear systems is presented. When applied to
   a three-link arm model, the control scheme reproduces qualitative
   signaling phenomena observed in human reaching experiments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel wearable leg size sensor for early detection
   of acute decompensated heart failure. The size sensor is based on the
   measurement of the magnetic field of an inductor and its variation with
   size. It has a simple and inexpensive construction involving two 3-axis
   magnetic sensors, an inductor and a microprocessor. In order to enable
   robust size estimation during rough real world use of the sensor, three
   estimation algorithms are developed based on models of the magnetic
   field variation over a cylindrical surface. The magnetic field models
   developed include those for a dipole and for a uniformly magnetized
   cylinder. The estimation algorithms used include a linear regression
   equation, a nonlinear regression equation and an extended Kalman filter.
   Experimental in vitro tests show that the size sensor performs
   accurately, with sub-millimeter estimation errors. The uniformly
   magnetized cylinder model yields the best performance that is robust to
   bias and misalignment errors. The developed size sensor can also be used
   for a number of other biomedical applications as well.}},

   a result by Zelazo and Burger ( Theorem 3.2), which provides upper
   bounds on the magnitudes of the negative weights in terms of effective
   resistances within which to ensure definiteness of the Laplacians, are
   provided. Both proofs are direct and intuitive. The first employs purely
   geometrical arguments while the second relies on passivity arguments and
   the laws of physics for electrical circuits. The latter is then used to
   establish consensus in multi-agent systems with generalized high-order
   dynamics. A numerical example is given at the end of the paper to
   highlight the result.}},

Abstract = {{This paper deals with observer-based controller design problem for
   discrete-time Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems with uncertain
   parameters. The proposed technique consists in designing an
   observer-based controller which stabilizes the LPV system, provided that
   the norm of the difference between the measured parameter and the real
   one does not exceed a tolerated maximum value. The particularity of the
   proposed design method, compared to some existing methods in the
   literature, is that it works on one systematic step, without any a
   priori choice of some observer-based controller parameters. The solution
   is formulated in terms of a single set of Linear Matrix Inequalities
   (LMIs). Besides, a relaxation of the proposed design with respect to the
   uncertainty is provided. The proposed approach is compared with other
   similar stabilization approaches, through two numerical examples.}},

   It has been recognized recently that semidefinite optimization problems
   (SDP) can be cast into second order cone programs (SOCP) by replacing
   the positive definiteness constraints with stronger, scaled diagonal
   dominance conditions. Since the scalability of SOCP solvers is much

Abstract = {{Imaging and manipulating objects down to the molecular level plays a
   crucial role in many disciplines. It allows to unravel molecular
   phenomena, to form materials with new chemical and physical properties,
   or to build objects on an atomic scale. Science on the nanoscale is
   inherently interdisciplinary. It requires knowledge and insight into
   many fields, spanning from modeling, measuring, imaging, actuation to
   control. Often feedback control facilitates operation with molecular
   precision, despite the fact that many physical phenomena at the
   molecular level are still not well understood, and that stochastic and
   nonlinear effects are inherently present. This work provides an insight
   into some of the current control related research activities on a
   molecular scale. This is done considering examples from different
   fields: control related to scanning probe microscopy such as atomic
   force microscopy, controlled self assembly on a molecular scale, control
   aspects of molecular transport, and the use of control for manipulation
   of single molecules using macroscopic probe tips. The hope is that
   control related researchers, who are not experts in these fields, become
   aware of the opportunities present, which could also drive new
   theoretical developments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on developing the dynamic model and motion control of
   an electro-hydraulically actuated Rapid Compression Expansion Machine
   (RCEM) with a unique feature of real time trajectory control. For
   combustion research aimed at investigation of influence of piston
   trajectory on combustion kinetics, the ability to control piston
   trajectory is an important requirement which is not offered by current
   RCEMs. Moreover, the feature of trajectory control offers ultimate
   flexibility in terms of RCEM operation. While any change in the
   compression ratio or compression time of most current RCMs has to be
   realized mechanically, the same can be accomplished by a controlled
   trajectory RCEM merely by altering the reference trajectory fed to the
   controller. However, high speed operation and high force requirement for
   piston motion presents a major challenge for the actuation system of
   controlled trajectory RCEM. The dynamic model used for the design of a
   high bandwidth actuator which can provide large actuation force, and the
   high speed motion control designed to ensure precise reference
   trajectory tracking by the piston are presented here.}},

Abstract = {{Crash statistics show that over 80\% of motoristbicycle crashes occur

   development of a collision avoidance system for bicycles for prediction

   weight constraints highly limit the sensors and electronics that can be
   used on a bicycle and necessitate the development of new vehicle
   detection and tracking systems. Custom sonar and laser sensors and
   associated position estimation algorithms for tracking are developed. A
   custom sonar sensor with one sonar transmitter and two receivers is
   developed to estimate both the distance and angular orientation of
   vehicles on the sides of the bicycle. A custom single-target laser
   sensor on a rotating platform is developed to track longer distance
   vehicles. A model predictive control formulation is used to determine
   the real-time orientation of the rotating laser platform. Preliminary
   experimental data is presented to evaluate the performance of the side
   sonar system from a prototype instrumented bicycle. Simulation results

Abstract = {{This paper presents a condition for global asymptotic synchronization of
   Lienard-type nonlinear oscillators in uniform LTI electrical networks
   with series R-L circuits modeling interconnections. By uniform
   electrical networks, we mean that the per-unit-length impedances are
   identical for the interconnecting lines. We derive conditions for global
   asymptotic synchronization for a particular feedback architecture where
   the derivative of the oscillator output current supplements the innate
   current feedback induced by simply interconnecting the oscillator to the
   network. Our proof leverages a coordinate transformation to a set of
   differential coordinates that emphasizes signal differences and the
   particular form of feedback permits the formulation of a quadratic
   Lyapunov function for this class of networks. This approach is
   particularly interesting since synchronization conditions are difficult
   to obtain by means of quadratic Lyapunov functions when only current
   feedback is used and for networks composed of series R-L circuits. Our
   synchronization condition depends on the algebraic connectivity of the
   underlying network, and reiterates the conventional wisdom from
   Lyapunov-and passivity-based arguments that strong coupling is required
   to ensure synchronization.}},

Abstract = {{A method to reduce the dynamic order of linear parameter-varying (LPV)
   systems in grid representation is developed in this paper. It
   approximates balancing and truncation by an oblique projection onto a
   dominant subspace. The approach is novel in its use of a
   parameter-varying kernel to define the direction of this projection.
   Parameter-varying state transformations in general lead to parameter
   rate dependence in the model. The proposed projection avoids this
   dependence and maintains a consistent state space basis for the

Abstract = {{A method is presented for synthesizing output estimators for a class of
   continuous time, uncertain, linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. The
   uncertain system is described as an interconnection of a nominal LPV
   system and a block structured perturbation. The nominal LPV system is
   ``gridded{''} over the space of parameters, with the state matrices
   being arbitrary functions of the parameters. The input/output behavior
   of the perturbation is described by integral quadratic constraints. The
   main contribution of this paper is the derivation of convex conditions
   for the synthesis of output estimators for uncertain, grid-based LPV
   plants. Since LPV systems do not have valid frequency response
   interpretations, the time domain, dissipation inequality approach is
   followed. Robust performance is measured using the upper-bound on the
   worstcase induced-L 2 gain of the closed loop. The effectiveness of the
   proposed method is demonstrated using a numerical example.}},

Abstract = {{There is extensive literature on the description of joint probability
   distributions via graphs, where each node represents a random variable
   and the edges describe a form of coupling among the variables. The
   connections in these graphical models do not necessarily represent forms
   of input/output relations among the variables involved. Instead, they
   typically represent a convenient factorization of their joint
   probability distribution. For these factorizations to be mathematically
   meaningful, the underlying graph structure is required to have no
   directed cycles. Thus, graphical models of random variables typically
   deal with directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). Conversely, in the area of
   dynamic systems, and especially control theory, it is common to find
   network models involving stochastic processes that influence each other
   according to a directed graph. In this case the graph connections do
   indeed represent a input/output relations and feedback loops may be
   present, as well. As a consequence, the network structures underlying
   graphical models of random variables and networks of dynamic systems
   differ fundamentally. Furthermore, it is not a straightforward task to
   unify or reconcile these two semantically different graph descriptions.
   Indeed, introducing a notion of factorization in networks of dynamic
   systems would present technical difficulties due not only to the
   potential presence of loops, but also to the fact that stochastic
   processes involve an infinite number of random variables. Despite these
   differences, it has become evident during recent years that
   methodologies can be borrowed from probabilistic graphical models and
   used for the analysis, identification and control design in the domain
   of networks of dynamic systems and viceversa. Some of these
   methodologies can be imported with no significant modifications, while
   others need to be substantially revisited. This article is an attempt to
   bridge the conceptual and methodological gap between graphical models of
   random variables and networks of dynamic systems, creating a single
   unified language and theoretical framework for these two different
   classes. This is achieved by drawing parallels between similar
   approaches and highlighting their main differences.}},

Abstract = {{Transport at the micro scale is an essential aspect for many emerging
   areas including manufacturing systems at the nanoscale. Transfer of
   beads decorated with cargo under the influence of optical fields provide
   an attractive means of such transport. Physical models that describe
   beads in optical fields under the influence of thermal noise are
   available which yield a qualitative understanding of the bead motion;
   however, it is difficult to arrive at models that provide quantitative
   agreement. The first contribution of the article is the determination of
   a model of a bead under a static field realized by optical forces where
   the model can be used to predict the motion of the bead under a
   time-varying optical potential with high fidelity. Close agreement
   between model based Monte Carlo simulations and experimental
   observations is seen. The other contribution is a strategy for directed
   transport of micron-sized particles that utilizes the proposed models to
   arrive at conclusions which are experimentally verified and easy to
   implement. The effectiveness of this transport mechanism is justified
   based on splitting probability computations. Applications to transport
   of cargo across multiple locations and transport of multiple cargo are
   experimentally demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{Recently distributed integral controllers relying on averaging and
   communication have been proposed as effective means for optimal
   frequency regulation in power systems, load balancing of network flows,
   and as natural extensions to static consensus controllers. Typically,
   only the questions of stability, disturbance rejection, and steady-state
   resource allocation are addressed in the literature, and the problems of
   transient performance and optimal communication network design remain
   open. In this paper we consider the optimal frequency regulation problem
   and propose a principled heuristic to identify the topology and gains of
   the distributed integral control layer. We employ an L-1 -regularized H
   (2) -optimal control framework as a means for striking a balance between
   network performance and communication requirements. The resulting
   optimal control problem is solved using the alternating direction method
   of multipliers algorithm. For the IEEE 39 New England benchmark problem,
   we demonstrate that the identified sparse and distributed integral
   controller can achieve reasonable performance relative to the optimal
   centralized controller. Interestingly, the identified control
   architecture is directed and correlates with the generator rotational
   inertia and cost coefficients.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of output voltage regulation for
   multiple DC-DC converters connected to a grid, and prescribes a robust
   scheme for sharing power among different sources. Also it develops a
   method for sharing 120 Hz ripple among DC power sources in a prescribed
   proportion, which accommodates the different capabilities of DC power
   sources to sustain the ripple. We present a decentralized control
   architecture, where a nested (inner-outer) control design is used at
   every converter. An interesting aspect of the proposed design is that
   the analysis and design of the entire multi-converter system can be done
   using an equivalent single converter system, where the multi-converter
   system inherits the performance and robustness achieved by a design for
   the single-converter system. Another key aspect of this work is that the
   voltage regulation problem is addressed as a disturbance-rejection
   problem, where unknown load current is viewed as an external signal, and
   thus, no prior information is required on the nominal loading
   conditions. The control design is obtained using robust optimal-control
   framework. Case studies presented show the enhanced performance of
   prescribed optimal controllers.}},

Abstract = {{In groupware systems a broad range of requirements for user coordination
   and data consistency need to be supported. The notions of event
   causality and user awareness are central in such requirements.
   Traditional transaction models supported in general purpose database
   management systems with strong consistency guarantees have been found to
   be unsuitable for groupware systems. Weaker models for data consistency
   are needed for user awareness and cooperative activities. Objects in the
   shared workspace need to be managed with different consistency
   guarantees. Towards such requirements, we examine here the applicability
   of a distributed transaction management model which supports multilevel
   consistency. The consistency levels supported in this model include
   serializable transactions for strong consistency and weaker consistency
   models such as Causal Snapshot Isolation (CSI), CSI with commutative
   updates, and CSI with asynchronous updates. We review the coordination
   and data consistency requirements in groupware systems. We show using
   two examples how replicated shared data in distributed groupware systems}},

Pages = {{125-132}},
Abstract = {{Bikeshare systems are relatively new, highly visible additions to urban
   transportation systems that provide opportunities to cycle or combine
   cycling with other modes of transportation. The research reported here
   presents new evidence about the role of bikeshare systems in travel
   behavior on the basis of diffusion of innovation theory. The study
   hypothesized that bikeshare systems have spatial contagion or spillover
   effects on (a) the propensity of individuals to adopt bikeshare and (b)
   the propensity to bicycle within the general population. The first
   hypothesis (H1) was tested by modeling membership growth as a function
   of system expansion and the existing, proximate membership base. The
   second hypothesis (H2) was tested by using bikeshare activity levels
   near home in a model of household-level bicycle participation and trip
   frequency. The study yielded mixed results. Bikeshare membership growth
   appeared to be driven in small part by a contagion effect of existing
   bikeshare members nearby, even after controlling for system growth.
   However, within the general population, a significant relationship was
   not identified between proximity to bikeshare stations and cycling
   participation or frequency. These findings complement those of other
   recent studies of bikeshare systems, which indicated that systems are
   still evolving. The present findings also have implications for
   marketing, infrastructure investments, and future research about
   bikeshare operations and innovation.}},

Abstract = {{Clinical notes contain rich information about dietary supplements, which
   are critical for detecting signals of dietary supplement side effects
   and interactions between drugs and supplements. One of the important
   factors of supplement documentation is usage status, such as started and
   discontinuation. Such information is usually stored in the unstructured
   clinical notes. We developed a rule-based classifier to identify
   supplement usage status in clinical notes. The categories referring to
   the patient's status of supplement use were classified into four
   classes: Continuing (C), Discontinued (D), Started (S), and Unclassified
   (U). Clinical notes containing 10 of the most commonly consumed
   supplements (i.e., alfalfa, echinacea, fish oil, garlic, ginger, ginkgo,
   ginseng, melatonin, St. John's Wort, and Vitamin E) were retrieved from
   the University of Minnesota Clinical Data Repository. The gold standard
   was defined by manually annotating 1000 randomly selected sentences or
   statements mentioning at least one of these 10 supplements. The rules in
   the classifier was initially developed on two-thirds of the set of 7
   supplements (i.e., alfalfa, garlic, ginger, ginkgo, ginseng, St. John's
   Wort, and Vitamin E); the performance was evaluated on the remaining
   one-third of this set. To evaluate the generalizability of rules, we
   further validated the second testing set on other 3 supplements (i.e.,
   echinacea, fish oil, and melatonin). The performance of the classifier
   achieved F-measures of 0.95, 0.97, 0.96, and 0.96 for status C, D, S,
   and U on 7 supplements, respectively. The classifier also showed good
   generalizability when it was applied to the other 3 supplements with
   F-measures of 0.96 for C, 0.96 for D, 0.95 for S, and 0.89 for U. This
   study demonstrated that the classifier can accurately classify
   supplement usage status, which can be further integrated as a module
   into the existing natural language processing pipeline for supporting
   dietary supplement knowledge discovery.}},

Abstract = {{A `region' is an important concept in interpreting 3D point cloud data
   since regions may correspond to objects in a scene. To correctly
   interpret 3D point cloud data, we need to partition the dataset into
   regions that correspond to objects or parts of an object. In this paper,
   we present a region growing approach that combines global (topological)
   and local (color, surface normal) information to segment 3D point cloud
   data. Using ideas from persistent homology theory, our algorithm grows a
   simplicial complex representation of the point cloud dataset. At each
   step in the growth process we compute the zeroth homology group of the
   complex, which corresponds to the number of connected components, and
   use color and surface normal statistics to build regions. Lastly, we
   extract out the segmented regions of the dataset. We show that this
   method provides a stable segmentation of point cloud data in the
   presence of noise and poorly sampled data, thus providing advantages
   over contemporary region-based segmentation techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Throughout the wide range of aerial robot related applications,
   selecting a particular airframe is often a trade-off. Fixed-wing
   small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) typically have difficulty
   surveying at low altitudes while quad-rotor UAVs, having more
   maneuverability, suffer from limited flight time. Recent prior work
   {[}1] proposes a solar-powered small-scale aerial vehicle designed to
   transform between fixed-wing and quad-rotor configurations. Surplus
   energy collected and stored while in a fixed-wing configuration is
   utilized while in a quad-rotor configuration.
   This paper presents an improvement to the robot's design in {[}1] by
   pursuing a modular airframe, an optimization of the hybrid propulsion
   system, and solar power electronics. Two prototypes of the robot have
   been fabricated for independent testing of the airframe in fixed-wing
   and quad-rotor states. Validation of the solar power electronics and
   hybrid propulsion system designs were demonstrated through a combination
   of simulation and empirical data from prototype hardware.}},

Abstract = {{This work focuses on the design and predicted performance of a two meter
   wingspan solar powered unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Such a platform

   the portability and deployment simplicity of a small airframe with the
   long flight time of a solar UAV. Methods to design and predict
   properties of a two meter solar UAV are described including airframe
   type selection, mass estimation, and propulsion requirements. A
   simplified approach to predict flight time is presented as well as an
   improved metric for quantifying multi-day flight robustness. Maximum
   flight time for the two meter airframe considered is estimated to be
   greater than ten hours which is an order of magnitude improvement over
   reported commercially available options. In terms of multi-day flight
   capability, total mass is predicted to be within the bounds of a
   realizable aircraft based on extrapolation from larger experimentally

Abstract = {{This paper presents a domain decomposition-type method for solving real
   symmetric (Hermitian) eigenvalue problems in which we seek all
   eigenpairs in an interval {[}alpha, beta] or a few eigenpairs next to a
   given real shift zeta. A Newton-based scheme is described whereby the
   problem is converted to one that deals with the interface nodes of the
   computational domain. This approach relies on the fact that the inner
   solves related to each local subdomain are relatively inexpensive. This
   Newton scheme exploits spectral Schur complements, and these lead to
   so-called eigenbranches, which are rational functions whose roots are
   eigenvalues of the original matrix. Theoretical and practical aspects of
   domain decomposition techniques for computing eigenvalues and
   eigenvectors are discussed. A parallel implementation is presented and
   its performance on distributed computing environments is illustrated by
   means of a few numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to quantify cell migration and invasion is critical in the
   study of cancer metastasis. Current invasion assays, such as the Boyden
   Chamber, present difficulties in the measurement of the invasion of
   cells that are few in number and are intrinsically tied to the cell
   microenvironment. There exists a need for a three-dimensional invasion
   assay that is easily reproduced, accessible for most laboratories, and
   requires no displacement of cells from their original microenvironment.
   Here we present a simple design for an inverted vertical invasion assay
   able to assess the invasion capabilities of cells in a three
   dimensional, extracellular matrix-based environment without displacement
   from the original culture location. We used the assay to determine the
   migratory capacity of hybrids between mesenchymal/multipotent
   stem/stroma cells (MSCs) and breast cancer cells MCF7. These hybrids are
   formed reliably but rarely (1 in 1,000 cells) and for this reason
   require an invasion assay that does not involve extensive cell
   manipulation. Using this assay, we found that MSCs, breast cancer cells,
   and corresponding fusion products are able to migrate and invade through
   the extracellular matrix and that hybrids invade in a manner more
   similar to stromal cells than cancer cells. Thus, this assay can aid the
   study of the invasive capacity of both cancerous cells and associated
   fusion hybrids and could augment testing of therapeutic strategies to
   inhibit metastatic spread.}},

Abstract = {{Aftermarket dual-fuel injection systems using a variety of different
   fumigants have been proposed as alternatives to expensive
   after-treatment to control NOX emissions from legacy diesel engines.
   However, our previous work has shown that available add-on systems using
   hydrous ethanol as the fumigant achieve only minor benefits in emissions
   without re calibration of the diesel fuel injection strategy. This study
   experimentally re-evaluates a novel aftermarket dual-fuel port fuel
   injection (PFI) system used in our previous work, with the addition of
   higher flow injectors to increase the fumigant energy fraction (FEF),
   defined as the ratio of energy provided by the hydrous ethanol on a
   lower heating value (LHV) basis to overall fuel energy. Results of this
   study confirm our earlier findings that as FEF increases, NO emissions
   decrease, while NO2 and unburned ethanol emissions increase, leading to
   no change in overall NOX. Peak cylinder pressure and apparent rates of
   heat release are not strongly dependent on FEF, indicating that
   in-cylinder NO formation rates by the Zel'dovich mechanism remains the
   same. Through single zone modeling, we show the feasibility of
   in-cylinder NO conversion to NO2 aided by unburned ethanol. The modeling
   results indicate that NO to NO2 conversion occurs during the early
   expansion stroke where bulk gases have temperature in the range of
   1150-1250 K. This work conclusively proves that aftermarket dual fuel
   systems for fixed calibration diesel engines cannot reduce NOX emissions
   without lowering peak temperature during diffusive combustion
   responsible for forming NO in the first place.}},

Abstract = {{Biofiltration is a proven method to reduce odor and gas emissions from
   swine buildings and manure storage units. Biofilter media selection and
   moisture content fluctuations significantly influence biofilter
   performance. The purpose of this study was to test corn cobs as an
   alternative biofilter media because wood chips may become less available
   in the future due to the spread of emerald ash borer disease. In
   addition, a naturally occurring adsorbent (diatomaceous shale) was
   tested as an additive to manage biofilter media moisture content. Five 1
   m x 1 m x 1 m biofilter cells were built to treat pit fan exhaust air
   from a swine finishing barn. A semi-continuous sampling system was used
   to measure the biofilters' inlet and outlet gas concentrations. Results
   showed that all of the biofilters were effective, reducing H2S emissions
   on average by 7.3\% to 50.1\% and reducing NH3 emissions on average by
   9.8\% to 86.3\%. The corn cobs were less dense and more porous than the
   wood chips and had lower pressure drop per unit depth. Adding 15\%
   diatomaceous shale to the corn cobs helped manage media moisture and
   improved H2S and NH3 reduction efficiencies. However, after 16 months of
   media aging, high levels of N2O generation were observed during two
   sampling days. The estimated media cost with 15\% diatomaceous shale was
   \$0.52 per m(3) h(-1) (\$0.89 per cfm) of air treated. The corn cobs
   cost (100\% corn cob biofilter) was \$0.03 per m(3) h(-1) (\$0.05 per
   cfm) of air treated.}},

Abstract = {{Livestock production accounts for a third of total U.S. anthropogenic
   methane (CH4) emissions. Mitigating these greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   is central to efforts aimed at curbing near-term climate change, but
   low-cost, practical technologies are needed to reduce fugitive CH4 from
   farms. Biofilters have mitigation potential, but current designs for
   odor are limited in their ability to capture CH4. Fungi have been shown
   to improve capture of hard-to-target gases in other biofilter
   applications and were investigated here for their ability to capture
   CH4. Using a lab-scale biofilter, several fungal species were shown to
   improve CH4 capture compared to a bacterial system and sterile control.
   A subsequent experiment with Pleurotus ostreatus found capture to
   increase with increasing levels of fungal biomass. Using a
   chromatographic isotherm, the ability of fungal materials to sorb CH4
   was confirmed, and again greater sorption of CH4 was possible when
   fungal biomass was increased. These results demonstrate the ability of
   fungi to capture CH4 and warrant their investigation as a way to improve
   the CH4 mitigation capacity of livestock emission biofilters.}},

   to implement miniaturized devices based on 2D materials. Black
   Phosphorous (BP) as a thermodynamically stable state of phosphorous is a
   multilayer material, which exhibits strong anisotropy due to its
   particular atomic lattice. The anisotropy in this material offers
   implementation of ultrathin polarization rotators in THz regime, which
   has potential applications in sensing and beam engineering. In this
   contribution, we present how a monolayer of black phosphorous can offer
   strong and broadband polarization rotation in THz frequencies.
   Interestingly, the amount of rotation is tunable over a large interval
   by doping the BP monolayer or electrostatic gating.}},

Abstract = {{Efficient and robust control of cardiac pacemaker is essential for
   providing life-saving control action to regulate Heart Rate (HR) in a
   dynamic environment. Several controller designs involving
   proportional-integral-derivative (PID) and fuzzy logic controllers (FLC)
   have been reported but each have their limitations to face the dynamic
   challenge of regulating HR. Fractional-order control (FOC) systems
   provide controllers that are described by fractional-order differential
   equations that offers fine tuning of the control parameters to provide
   robust and efficient performance. In this work a robust fractional-order
   PID (FOPID) controller is designed based on Ziegler-Nichols tuning
   method. The stable FOPID controller outperformed PID controllers with
   different tuning methods and also the FLC in terms of rise time,
   settling time and \% overshoot. The FOPID controller also demonstrated
   feasibility for rate-adaptive pacing. However, the FOPID controller
   designed in this work is not optimal and is limited by the tuning
   procedure. More efficient design using optimization techniques such as
   particle swarm intelligence or genetic algorithm tuning can offer
   optimal control of the cardiac pacemaker.}},

Abstract = {{Respiratory failure is a typical clinical issue which needs immediate
   help with mechanical ventilation while the hidden reason is recognized
   and treated. Mechanical ventilation can damage the lungs if not used
   properly. It is desirable to provide the desired blood levels of CO2 and
   oxygen with limited pressure to avoid causing the lung injury. This
   paper uses the adaptive inverse dynamics control technique to control a
   two-compartment modeled respiratory system. Based on the nonlinear
   respiratory model and desired respiratory pressures, the inverse
   dynamics control method was applied and computer simulations were
   conducted to evaluate the performance of the control method. Our
   preliminary results indicate that the tracking errors can be improved if
   the parameter values associated with the control scheme are properly
   used. More extensive computer simulations and performance robustness are
   currently under investigation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel algorithm to compute real-valued fast
   Fourier transform (RFFT) that is canonic with respect to the number of
   signal values. A signal value can correspond to a purely real or purely
   imaginary value, while a complex signal consists of 2 signal values. For
   an N-point RFFT, each stage need not compute more than N signal values,
   since the degrees of freedom of the input data is N. Any more than N
   signal values computed at any stage is inherently redundant. Canonic
   RFFT algorithms are defined as those RFFT algorithms that have the least
   number of signals at each FFT stage. In order to reduce the redundant
   samples, a sample removal lemma, and two types of twiddle factor
   transformations are proposed: pushing and modulation. We consider 4
   different cases. Canonic RFFT for any composite length can be computed
   by applying the proposed algorithm recursively. Performances of
   different RFFTs are also discussed in this paper. The major advantages
   of the canonic RFFTs are that they require the least butterfly
   operations, lead to more regular sub-blocks in the data-flow, and only
   involve real datapath when mapped to architectures.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel architectures for radial basis function (RBF)
   kernel computation for support vector machine (SVM) classifier using
   stochastic logic. Stochastic computing systems involve low hardware
   complexity and are inherently fault-tolerant. Two types of architectures
   are presented. These include: an implementation with input and output
   both in bipolar format and an implementation with bipolar input and
   unipolar output. The computation of RBF kernel is comprised of the
   squared Euclidean distance and the exponential function. In the first
   implementation, two components are implemented in bipolar format and the
   exponential function is designed based on the finite state machine (FSM)
   method. The second implementation computes the squared Euclidean
   distance with bipolar input and unipolar output. The exponential
   function is implemented in unipolar format based on the Maclaurin
   expansion. The accuracies of two architectures are compared using
   support vectors from classification of electroencephalogram (EEG)
   signals for seizure prediction. From simulation results, it is shown
   that the computational error of the second stochastic implementation
   with format conversion is 24.90\% less than that of the first

Abstract = {{We study the minimum-concave-cost flow problem on a two-dimensional
   grid. We characterize the computational complexity of this problem based
   on the number of rows and columns of the grid, the number of different
   capacities over all the arcs, and the location of sources and sinks. The
   concave cost over each arc is assumed to be evaluated through an oracle
   machine, i.e., the oracle machine returns the cost over an arc in a
   single computational step, given the flow value and the arc index. We
   propose an algorithm whose running time is polynomial in the number of
   columns of the grid for the following cases: (1) the grid has a constant
   number of rows, a constant number of different capacities over all the
   arcs, and sources and sinks in at most two rows; (2) the grid has two
   rows and a constant number of different capacities over all the arcs
   connecting rows; (3) the grid has a constant number of rows and all
   sources in one row, with infinite capacity over each arc. These are
   presumably the most general polynomially solvable cases, since we show
   that the problem becomes NP-hard when any condition in these cases is
   removed. Our results apply to several variants and generalizations of
   the single item dynamic lot sizing model and answer several questions
   raised in serial supply chain optimization.}},

Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Reducing the burden of waiting in transit travel is critical to
   increasing the attractiveness of public transportation. Waiting time
   perceptions are highly subjective and vary according to mode,
   availability of schedule information, and stop amenities. The research
   on pedestrian design finds that high-quality and natural environments
   reduce stress and encourage walking and bicycling. It seems reasonable
   that similar effects would apply for transit users on the basis of the
   environments around transit stops, but little research directly explores
   the issue. This paper responds to this knowledge gap by examining how
   perceptions of waiting time vary in relation to stop environments. The
   research compared transit users' actual and estimated wait time at 36
   stops and stations in a mix of environmental situations in the region of
   the Twin Cities, Minnesota. Regression analysis explained the variation
   in riders' self-reported waiting time as a function of their externally
   observed waiting times as well as characteristics of the environment
   surrounding the stop and station. For waits longer than 5 min,
   perceptible pollution and exposure to traffic led to significant
   overestimates of waiting time. Riders waiting at stops with dense,
   mature tree cover, however, significantly underestimated their waiting
   times. The effect of dense, mature tree cover is strong enough to
   compensate for the effects of both air pollution and traffic awareness.
   Policy implications and further research needs are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a learning-based framework named SMARTTALK for
   natural-language human-robot interaction (HRI). The primary goal of this
   framework is to enable non-expert users to control and program a mobile
   robot using natural language commands. SMARTTALK is modality-agnostic,
   and is capable of integrating with both speech and non-speech (e.g.,
   gesture-based) communication. Initially, robots using this mechanism are
   equipped with a limited vocabulary of primitive commands and
   functionality; however, through extended use and interaction, the robots
   are able to learn new commands and adapt to user's behaviors and habits.
   This makes the proposed framework highly desirable for long-term
   deployment in a variety of HRI tasks. We present the design of this
   framework and experimental data on a number of realistic scenarios to
   evaluate its performance. A qualitative experiment on a robotic platform
   is also presented.}},

   including the ADC, interfacing sensors, and power management circuit is
   fabricated in 0.18 mu m CMOS technology. The ADC works with a single
   on-chip reference voltage. The fabricated ADC occupies 0.21 mm(2), and
   consumes 1.3 mu W from the 1.2-V supply voltage at room temperature.
   Power consumption increases almost linearly with temperature and reaches
   1.7 mu W at 85 degrees C. The sleep current is less than 10 nA. In
   free-running mode at 40 kS/s, the ADC achieves 68 dB peak SNDR with
   OSR=200. This corresponds to FoM(w)=1.58 pJ/conv., which is comparable
   to the state-of-the-art incremental ADCs, while power consumption is at

Abstract = {{To maintain nominal flight control system functionalities during fault
   scenarios, enhancements of the state of-practice angle of attack fault
   accommodation strategies are presented. The enhancements rely on
   combining modern fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques with a
   robust envelope protection algorithm. The FDD system is able to detect
   and isolate partial or total losses of angle of attack sensors. The
   angle of attack is not a directly controlled variable in the flight
   control system, but is used to protect the aircraft from exceeding the
   flight envelope. To avoid the state-of-practice degradation towards an
   unprotected control law in case of a total angle of attack sensor loss,
   longitudinal protection law functionalities independent of the lost
   measurements are proposed. They provide satisfactory prevention of
   reaching difficult flight conditions and can be operated together with
   the nominal command and stability augmentation system. This paper
   discusses the protection law design in conjunction with the sensor
   monitoring scheme and the nominal inner loop control law. The latest
   results of an extensive industrial validation and verification campaign
   are reported.}},

Abstract = {{Pressure ulcers pose a huge financial burden on the economy. Pressure
   ulcers cost between \$9.1 to 11.6 billion a year in the United States.
   Each individual pressure can cost from \$ 20,900 to \$ 151,700 per
   pressure ulcer. Wheelchair users with spinal cord injury have a higher
   risk of developing pressure ulcers due to limited mobility and the
   countless hours they spend in the wheelchair, exerting pressure on the
   points of interface between the bony structure and the wheelchair
   cushion. The areas of interface that are under prolonged pressure lack
   blood flow, causing the tissue to breakdown, leading to a decubitus or
   pressure ulcer. Approximately 28.9 \% wheelchair users in communities,
   27\% in nursing homes, and between 5 and 30\% of hospitalized patients
   develop pressure sores. Nearly 70\% of elderly patients develop pressure
   ulcers, which in turn significantly increase the healthcare management
   and costs and can be a cause of pain, discomfort, loss of independence
   and mobility in not only the elderly but also the younger patients.
   Mobile technology can be exploited to provide a technological solution
   to preventing pressure ulcers. An app was designed and developed to
   notify, walk through the process of weight shifting and also track the
   movements of the patient performing weight shifting using the
   accelerometer. The app was tested to find that the forward lean
   movements can be tracked accurately using the accelerometer but the
   lateral movements although tracked could not verify that the weight
   shifting was correctly performed. In order to fix this issue the
   pressure map is used as an additional sensor to track and monitor the
   weight shifting accurately. This paper discusses the design and
   development of the app in two phases.}},

Abstract = {{Tanimoto, or (extended) Jaccard, is an important similarity measure
   which has seen prominent use in fields such as data mining and
   chemoinformatics. Many of the existing state-of-the-art methods for
   market-basket analysis, plagiarism and anomaly detection, compound
   database search, and ligand-based virtual screening rely heavily on
   identifying Tanimoto nearest neighbors. Given the rapidly increasing
   size of data that must be analyzed, new algorithms are needed that can
   speed up nearest neighbor search, while at the same time providing
   reliable results. While many search algorithms address the complexity of
   the task by retrieving only some of the nearest neighbors, we propose a
   method that finds all of the exact nearest neighbors efficiently by
   leveraging recent advances in similarity search filtering. We provide
   tighter filtering bounds for the Tanimoto coefficient and show that our
   method, TAPNN, greatly outperforms existing baselines across a variety
   of real-world datasets and similarity thresholds.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents novel architectures for machine learning based
   classifiers using stochastic logic. Two types of classifier
   architectures are presented. These include: linear support vector
   machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN). Stochastic computing
   systems require fewer logic gates and are inherently fault-tolerant.
   Thus, these structures are well suited for nanoscale CMOS technologies.
   These architectures are validated using seizure prediction from
   electroencephalogram (EEG) as an application example. To improve the
   accuracy of proposed stochastic classifiers, a novel approach based on
   linear transformation of input data is proposed for EEG signal
   classification using linear SVM classifiers. Simulation results in terms
   of the classification accuracy are presented for the proposed stochastic
   computing and the traditional binary implementations based datasets from
   one patient. Compared to conventional binary implementation, the
   accuracy of the proposed stochastic ANN is improved by 5.89\%. Synthesis
   results are also presented for EEG signal classification. Compared to
   the traditional binary linear SVM, the hardware complexity, power
   consumption and critical path of the stochastic implementation are
   reduced by 78\%, 74\% and 53\%, respectively. The hardware complexity,
   power consumption and critical path of the stochastic ANN classifier are
   reduced by 92\%, 88\% and 47\%, respectively, compared to the
   conventional binary implementation.}},

Abstract = {{Monge-Kantorovich optimal mass transport (OMT) provides a blueprint for
   geometries in the space of positive densities it quantifies the cost of
   transporting a mass distribution into another. In particular, it
   provides natural options for interpolation of distributions
   (displacement interpolation) and for modeling flows. As such it has been
   the cornerstone of recent developments in physics, probability theory,
   image processing, time-series analysis, and several other fields. In
   spite of extensive work and theoretical developments, the computation of
   OMT for large-scale problems has remained a challenging task. An
   alternative framework for interpolating distributions, rooted in
   statistical mechanics and large deviations, is that of the Schrodinger
   bridge problem (SBP), which leads to entropic interpolation. SBP may be
   seen as a stochastic regularization of OMT, and can be cast as the
   stochastic control problem of steering the probability density of the
   state-vector of a dynamical system between two marginals. The actual
   computation of entropic flows, however, has received hardly any
   attention. In our recent work on Schrodinger bridges for Markov chains
   and quantum channels, we showed that the solution can be efficiently
   obtained from the fixed point of a map which is contractive in the
   Hilbert metric. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to show that a
   similar approach can be taken in the context of diffusion processes
   which (i) leads to a new proof of a classical result on SBP and (ii)
   provides an efficient computational scheme for both SBP and OMT. We
   illustrate this new computational approach by obtaining interpolation of
   densities in representative examples such as interpolation of images.}},

Abstract = {{Tracking and characterizing both active and inactive Space Objects (SOs)
   is required for protecting space assets. Characterizing and classifying
   space debris is critical to understanding the threat they may pose to
   active satellites and manned missions. This work examines SO
   classification using brightness measurements derived from
   electrical-optical sensors. The classification approach discussed in
   this work is data-driven in that it learns from data examples how to
   extract features and classify SOs. The classification approach is based
   on a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach where a layered
   hierarchical architecture is used to extract features from brightness
   measurements. Training samples are generated from physics-based models
   that account for rotational dynamics and light reflection properties of
   SOs. The number of parameters involved in modeling SO brightness
   measurements make traditional estimation approaches computationally
   expensive. This work shows that the CNN approach can efficiently solve
   classification problem for this complex physical dynamical system. The
   performance of these strategies for SO classification is demonstrated
   via simulated scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Modeling multi-way data can be accomplished using tensors, which are
   data structures indexed along three or more dimensions. Tensors are
   increasingly used to analyze extremely large and sparse multi-way
   datasets in life sciences, engineering, and business. The canonical
   polyadic decomposition (CPD) is a popular tensor factorization for
   discovering latent features and is most commonly found via the method of
   alternating least squares (CPD-ALS). The computational time and memory
   required to compute CPD limits the size and dimensionality of the
   tensors that can be solved on a typical workstation, making distributed
   solution approaches the only viable option. Most methods for
   distributed-memory systems have focused on distributing the tensor in a
   coarse-grained, one-dimensional fashion that prohibitively requires the
   dense matrix factors to be fully replicated on each node. Recent work
   overcomes this limitation by using a fine-grained decomposition of the
   tensor nonzeros, at the cost of computationally expensive hypergraph
   partitioning. To that effect, we present a medium-grained decomposition
   that avoids complete factor replication and communication, while
   eliminating the need for expensive pre-processing steps. We use a hybrid
   MPI+OpenMP implementation that exploits multi-core architectures with a
   low memory footprint. We theoretically analyze the scalability of the
   coarse-, medium-, and fine-grained decompositions and experimentally
   compare them across a variety of datasets. Experiments show that the
   medium-grained decomposition reduces communication volume by 36-90\%
   compared to the coarse-grained decomposition, is 41-76x faster than a
   state-of-the-art MPI code, and is 1.5-5.0x faster than the fine-grained
   decomposition with 1024 cores.}},

Abstract = {{One of the factors that limits the scale, performance, and
   sophistication of distributed applications is the difficulty of
   concurrently executing them on multiple distributed computing resources.
   In part, this is due to a poor understanding of the general properties
   and performance of the coupling between applications and dynamic
   resources. This paper addresses this issue by integrating abstractions
   representing distributed applications, resources, and execution
   processes into a pilot-based middleware. The middleware provides a
   platform that can specify distributed applications, execute them on
   multiple resource and for different configurations, and is instrumented
   to support investigative analysis. We analyzed the execution of
   distributed applications using experiments that measure the benefits of
   using multiple resources, the late-binding of scheduling decisions, and
   the use of backfill scheduling.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel offline buffer management scheme for
   flash-based storage and memory systems. NAND flash memory is a promising
   storage technology to accelerate IO performance which has been deployed
   widely in the high-performance data storage systems. The widespread use
   of this technology unleashed new products which employ flash memory in
   write intensive applications like server-side caches and in-memory
   database systems. However, due to limited endurance and relatively high
   write latency, it is critical to minimize writes to the flash memory in
   these use cases. Therefore, a small write buffer is used on the top of
   flash memory to coalesce write requests and reduce write amplification.
   Although multiple schemes have been proposed to enhance write buffer
   functionality, still it is not clear how much further these schemes can
   reduce write amplification and mitigate flash limitations. In this
   paper, we have focused on this issue and proposed a novel Offline Write
   Buffer Policy (OWBP) which can reduce flash write amplification by
   making policy decisions based on future write requests information. This
   scheme can provide a lower bound for the erase count while maintaining a
   competitive ratio of buffer hit. We believe OWBP is a useful addition to
   the flash memory firmware developer community for the evaluation of
   practical (online) write-buffer management schemes.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, several working implementations of inband full-duplex wireless
   systems have been presented, where the same node can transmit and
   receive simultaneously in the same frequency band. The introduction of
   such a possibility at the physical layer could lead to improved
   performance but also poses several challenges at the MAC layer. In this
   paper, an innovative mechanism of channel contention in full-duplex OFDM
   wireless networks is proposed. This strategy is able to ensure efficient
   transmission scheduling with the result of avoiding collisions and
   effectively exploiting full-duplex opportunities. As a consequence,
   considerable performance improvements are observed with respect to
   standard and state-of-the-art MAC protocols for wireless networks, as
   highlighted by extensive simulations performed in ad hoc wireless
   networks with varying number of nodes.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, statistical Quality of Service provisioning in next
   generation heterogeneous mobile cellular networks is investigated. To
   this aim, any active entity of the cellular network is regarded as a
   queuing system, whose statistical QoS requirements depend on the
   specific application. In this context, by quantifying the performance in
   terms of effective capacity, we introduce a lower bound for the system
   performance that facilitates an efficient analysis. We exploit this
   analytical framework to give insights about the possible improvement of
   the statistical QoS experienced by the users if the current
   heterogeneous cellular network architecture migrates from a Half Duplex
   to a Full Duplex mode of operation. Numerical results and analysis are
   provided, where the network is modeled as a Matern point processes with
   a hard core distance. The results demonstrate the accuracy and
   computational efficiency of the proposed scheme, especially in large

   are sources that live on a Bratteli diagram, a type of graph with a
   countable infinity of vertices and edges that are split into levels. The
   results are valid when the underlying Bratteli diagram satisfies a
   regularity condition. These results include an ergodic decomposition
   theorem, Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem, and theorems in source coding
   theory. The results are obtained using the Vershik transformation that
   is associated with a Bratteli diagram. It is explained how some
   previously known results in source coding for finite-alphabet stationary
   sequential information sources are obtainable from source coding results
   for Bratteli-Vershik sources.}},

Abstract = {{Symbolic model checkers can construct proofs of properties over very
   complex models. However, the results reported by the tool when a proof
   succeeds do not generally provide much insight to the user. It is often
   useful for users to have traceability information related to the proof:
   which portions of the model were necessary to construct it. This
   traceability information can be used to diagnose a variety of modeling
   problems such as overconstrained axioms and underconstrained properties,
   and can also be used to measure completeness of a set of requirements
   over a model. In this paper, we present a new algorithm to efficiently
   compute the inductive validity core (IVC) within a model necessary for
   inductive proofs of safety properties for sequential systems. The
   algorithm is based on the UNSAT core support built into current SMT
   solvers and a novel encoding of the inductive problem to try to generate
   a minimal inductive validity core. We prove our algorithm is correct,
   and describe its implementation in the JKind model checker for Lustre
   models. We then present an experiment in which we benchmark the
   algorithm in terms of speed, diversity of produced cores, and
   minimality, with promising results.}},

   samples are also compared with cracking performance. In this study,
   asphalt pavement sections from several locations were evaluated to
   encompass various types of asphalt mixtures and asphalt construction
   types that were commonly used in Minnesota. The amount of transverse
   cracking for each section was converted into a newly proposed cracking
   performance measure that accounted for the amount, rate, and timing of
   cracking. The comparisons between asphalt mixture attributes and
   cracking performance measures showed that the amounts of total asphalt
   binder and recycled asphalt binder may not be sufficient. Performance
   testing, in addition to currently used controls (mix volumetrics and
   constituent properties), is recommended to ensure good cracking
   performance. The DCT fracture energy results for companion sections show
   that mixtures with higher fracture energies exhibit lower amounts of
   transverse cracking.}},

Abstract = {{Today's methodologies for electromigration (EM) identify EM-susceptible
   wires based on their current density, using the Blech criterion to
   filter out wires that are EM-immortal. The Blech criterion is agnostic
   to the product lifetime and temperature conditions: many Blech-mortal
   wires may never experience EM during the product lifetime. We develop
   new methods that evaluate the transient evolution of stress, relative to
   the product lifetime, and present an improved set of simple and
   practical mortality criteria. On a set of power grid benchmarks, we
   demonstrate that the actual number of mortal wires may depend strongly
   on the lifetime and reliability conditions.}},

Abstract = {{A new technology for onboard liquid cooling of high power density
   electronic devices is introduced via conformal encapsulation of the
   devices and direct contact liquid cooling. This research effort
   addresses size, weight and power constraints of onboard application with
   a CFD-enabled design that delivers a uniform coolant flow over
   single-and multi-device layouts through a microgap channel. The paradigm
   shift is the replacement of inefficient remote air cooling and
   associated high resistance conduction paths with the use of microgap
   flow boiling with direct coolant contact at the device level. The
   coolant used in all measurements is Novec(TM) 7200, and the electronics
   are emulated with resistance heaters on a 1:1 scale. Thermal performance
   is demonstrated at power densities on the order of 1 KW/cm3. Parameters
   investigated include average device temperature, pressure drop, flow
   field characterization, and overall heat transfer coefficients. For
   single chip encapsulation, thermal-fluid performance with microgaps of
   0.25,0.5 and 0.75 mm is determined. With low coolant inlet subcooling,
   two-phase heat transfer is seen at all coolant mass flows. Device
   temperatures reach 95 degrees C for power dissipation of 50 - 80 W
   depending on coolant flow for a gap of 0.5 mm. Inlet subcooling of 25
   and 51 degrees C permits higher power dissipation with nucleate flow
   boiling on the device surface. For multi-device encapsulation comprising
   two memory chips arranged symmetrically in line with a larger processor,
   the best thermal performance is obtained for inlet flow over the
   processor. For all measurements, the gap between the processor and
   encapsulation is 0.5 mm, and the gap above the memory chips is 1.0 mm.
   For inlet coolant flow first over the memory chips, the small chips
   exceed the 95 degrees C limit when processor power is similar to 50 W or
   less. Processor temperature reaches 95 degrees C at similar to 80 W over
   the range of coolant flows tested. For inlet flow first over the
   processor, memory device temperatures are approximately the same over
   all levels of processor and memory chip powers. For processor power < 30
   W and an inlet coolant temperature of 25 degrees C, single-phase heat
   transfer is the dominant cooling mechanism. When processor power is > 40
   W, two-phase heat transfer dominates, and a processor power of 120 W is
   reached within the 95 degrees C threshold.}},

   convex poloytope. At its core, the proposed method relies on the
   solution of a linearly constrained least-squares optimization problem,
   which is formulated using sensitivity factors computed by linearizing
   the power flow equations around the operating point. Since this
   optimization problem admits a linear closedform solution, the polytope
   of permissible line flows is propagated through the solution, via set
   operations, to obtain the set of feasible nodal injections.}},

Abstract = {{The Adaptive Compressive Outlier Sensing (ACOS) method, proposed
   recently in (Li \& Haupt, 2015), is a randomized sequential sampling and
   inference method designed to locate column outliers in large, otherwise
   low rank, matrices. While the original ACOS established conditions on
   the sample complexity (i.e., the number of scalar linear measurements)
   sufficient to enable accurate outlier localization (with high
   probability), the guarantees required a minimum sample complexity that
   grew linearly (albeit slowly) in the number of matrix columns. This work
   presents a refined analysis of the sampling complexity of ACOS that
   overcomes this limitation; we show that the sample complexity of ACOS is
   sublinear in both of the matrix dimensions on the order of the squared
   rank of the low-rank component plus the number of outliers, times

Abstract = {{The increase in analysis of real life social networks has led to a
   better understanding of the ways humans socialize in a group. Since
   trust is an important part of any social interaction, researchers use
   such networks to understand the nuances of trust relationships. One of
   the major requirements in trust applications is identifying the
   trustworthy actors in these networks. This paper proposes a pair of
   complementary measures that can be used to measure trust scores of
   actors in a social network using involvement of social networks. Based
   on the proposed measures, an iterative matrix convergence algorithm is
   developed that calculates the trustingness and the trustworthiness of
   each actor in the network. Trustingness of an actor is defined as the
   propensity of an actor to trust his neighbors in the network.
   Trustworthiness, on the other hand, is defined as the willingness of the
   network to trust an individual actor. The algorithm is proposed based on
   the idea that a person having higher trustingness score contributes to
   the trustworthiness of its neighbors to a lower degree. Conversely, a
   higher trustworthiness score is a result of lots of neighbors linked to
   the actor having low trustingness scores. The algorithm runs in O (k x
   vertical bar E vertical bar) time where k denotes the number of
   iterations and vertical bar E vertical bar denotes the number of edges
   in the network. Moreover, the paper shows that the algorithm converges
   to a finite value quickly. Finally the proposed scores for trust
   prediction is implemented for various social networks and is shown that
   the proposed algorithm performs better (average 5 \%) than the state of
   the art trust scoring algorithms. The full version of the paper along
   with the coding implementation can be found at {[}3].}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the architecture and functionality of a work zone
   traffic information system that uses vehicle-to-vehicle communication,
   based on dedicated short-range communications (DSRC), and a newly
   designed hopping algorithm. ({''}Hopping{''} involves transmitting
   traffic messages via intermediate hosts to a target designation. The
   term is commonly used in the radio and wireless communication industry.)
   The proposed hopping algorithm can deliver in-vehicle messages
   transmitted by a roadside unit installed at a work zone site to faraway
   vehicles traveling toward the work zone on predefined routes. This newly
   designed hopping algorithm uses rectangular regions to define a hopping
   route and can hop messages to vehicles on multiple routes at the same
   time without the risk of creating a broadcast storm. Although the
   messages hopped by the proposed hopping algorithm will generally be
   applicable to vehicles on only one side of the road (traveling toward
   the work zone), the DSRC-equipped vehicles present on both sides of the
   road will participate in hopping to maximize the number of available
   hopping nodes in situations with lighter traffic flow or low DSRC market
   penetration. Furthermore, the hopping algorithm increases message
   security by not requiring the hopping nodes (i.e., the DSRC-equipped
   vehicles) to modify the contents of the hopped message. Numerical
   simulations have been performed to evaluate the performance of the
   hopping algorithm. The simulation results show that the proposed hopping
   algorithm works as expected and successfully disseminates DSRC messages
   along a predefined route.}},

Abstract = {{When establishing associations, known as trace links, between a
   requirement and the artifacts that lead to its satisfaction, it is
   essential to know what the links mean. While research into this type of
   traceability-what we call Requirements Satisfaction Traceability-has
   been an active research area for some time, none of the literature
   discusses the fact that there are often multiple ways in which a
   requirement can be satisfied, i.e., there are multiple satisfaction
   arguments. The distinction between establishing a single satisfaction
   argument between a requirement and its implementation (tracing one way
   the requirement is implemented) vs. tracing all satisfaction arguments,
   and the possible ramifications for how the trace links can be used in
   analysis, has not been well studied. We examine how this distinction
   changes the way traceability is perceived, established, maintained, and
   used. In this RE@Next! paper, we introduce and discuss the notion of
   ``complete{''} traceability, which considers all trace links between the
   requirements and the artifacts that work to satisfy the requirements,
   and contrast it with the partial traceability common in practice.}},

Abstract = {{Stochastic logic performs computation on data represented by random bit
   streams. The representation allows complex arithmetic to be performed
   with very simple logic, but it suffers from high latency and poor
   precision. Furthermore, the results are always somewhat inaccurate due
   to random fluctuations. The random or pseudorandom sources required to
   generate the representation are costly, consuming a majority of the
   circuit area (and diminishing the overall gains in area). In this paper,
   we show that randomness is not a requirement for this computational
   paradigm. If properly structured, the same arithmetical constructs can
   operate on deterministic bit streams, with the data represented
   uniformly by the fraction of 1's versus 0's. This paper presents three
   approaches for the computation: relatively prime stream lengths,
   rotation, and clock division. The three methods are evaluated on a
   collection of arithmetical functions. Unlike stochastic methods, all
   three of our deterministic methods produce completely accurate results.
   The cost of generating the deterministic streams is a small fraction of
   the cost of generating streams from random/pseudorandom sources. Most
   importantly, the latency is reduced by a factor of 1/2n, where n is the
   equivalent number of bits of precision.}},

   first generate a simplicial complex representation of the point cloud

   corresponds to the number of connected components. Finally, we extract

Abstract = {{Analysis of behavior using video is a promising approach for identifying
   risk markers for psychopathology that can be applied in a wide range of
   populations. Computer vision techniques are needed to automatically code
   behavior in order to reduce time and effort in these analyses. This
   paper discusses algorithms developed for the automatie analysis of video
   data from a study regarding the impact of environmental factors on
   youths with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Overhead videos of subjects
   washing hands were automatically annotated for activities such as
   rinsing, applying soap, and turning on/off the water faucet. These
   automated annotations were created by using a color-based background
   subtraction method to create a foreground probability score which is
   then used to determine if various labeled regions of interest (ROIs) are
   activated. These activation signals are then characterized and used to
   determine when different substeps of the handwashing procedure are
   performed. Automated annotations were validated by comparisons with
   hand-labeled ground truth.}},

   suitably extending the 1-D concept, the design of two-dimensional (2-D)
   notch filters is also derived. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the

Abstract = {{Inland water is an important natural resource that is critical for
   sustaining marine and terrestrial ecosystems as well as supporting a
   variety of human needs. Monitoring the dynamics of inland water bodies
   at a global scale is important for: (a) devising effective water
   management strategies, (b) assessing the impact of human actions on
   water security, (c) understanding the interplay between the
   spatio-temporal dynamics of surface water and climate change, and (d)
   near-real time mitigation and management of disaster events such as
   floods. Remote sensing datasets provide opportunities for global-scale
   monitoring of the extent or surface area of inland water bodies over
   time. We present a survey of existing remote sensing based approaches
   for monitoring the extent of inland water bodies and discuss their
   strengths and limitations. We further present an outline of the major
   challenges that need to be addressed for monitoring the extent and
   dynamics of water bodies at a global scale. Potential opportunities for
   overcoming some of these challenges are discussed using illustrative
   examples, laying the foundations for promising directions of future

Abstract = {{Wireless Power Transfer has become a commercially viable technology to
   charge devices because of the convenience of no power wiring and the
   reliability of continuous power supply. This paper concerns the
   fundamental issue of wireless charger placement with electromagnetic
   radiation (EMR) safety. Although there are a few wireless charging
   schemes consider EMR safety, none of them addresses the charger
   placement issue. In this paper, we propose PESA, a wireless charger
   Placement scheme that guarantees EMR SAfety for every location on the
   plane. First, we discretize the whole charging area and formulate the
   problem into the Multidimensional 0/1 Knapsack (MDK) problem. Second, we
   propose a fast approximation algorithm to the MDK problem. Third, we
   optimize our scheme to improve speed by double partitioning the area. We

Abstract = {{In data center networks, many network-intensive applications typically
   suffer TCP incast throughput collapse when bursty concurrent TCP flows
   share a single bottleneck link. To address the TCP incast problem, we
   first reveal theoretically and empirically that controlling the number
   of concurrent flows is much more effective in reducing the incast
   probability than controlling the congestion window. We further propose a
   novel cross-layer design called Adaptive Request Schedule (ARS), which
   dynamically adjusts the number of concurrent TCP flows by batching
   application requests according to the congestion state acquired from
   transport layer. ARS is deployed only at the aggregator-side, while
   making no modification on hundreds or thousands of workers. Broad
   applicability is another advantage of ARS. We integrated ARS
   transparently (i.e., without modification) with DCTCP and TCP NewReno on
   NS2 simulation and a physical testbed, respectively. The experimental
   results show that ARS significantly reduces the incast probability
   across different TCP protocols and that the network goodput can be
   increased consistently by on average 6x under severe congestion.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents the low temperature plasma-enhanced atomic layer
   deposition (PE-ALD) of TiN, a promising plasmonic synthetic metal. The
   plasmonics community has immediate needs for alternatives to traditional
   plasmonic materials (e.g. Ag and Au), which lack chemical, thermal, and
   mechanical stability. Plasmonic alloys and synthetic metals have
   significantly improved stability, but their growth can require
   high-temperatures (> 400 degrees C), and it is difficult to control the
   thickness and directionality of the resulting film, especially on
   technologically important substrates. Such issues prevent the
   application of alternative plasmonic materials for both fundamental
   studies and large-scale industrial applications. Alternatively, PE-ALD
   allows for conformal deposition on a variety of substrates with
   consistent material properties. This conformal coating will allow the
   creation of exotic three-dimensional structures, and low-temperature
   deposition techniques will provide unrestricted usage across a variety
   of platforms. The characterization of this new plasmonic material was
   performed with in-situ spectroscopic ellipsometry as well as Auger
   electron spectroscopy for analysis of TiN film sensitivity to oxide
   cross-contamination. Plasmonic TiN films were fabricated, and a chlorine
   plasma etch was found to pattern two dimensional gratings as a test
   structure. Optical measurements of 900 nm period gratings showed
   reasonable agreement with theoretical modeling of the fabricated
   structures, indicating that ellipsometry models of the TiN were indeed
   accurate.}},

Abstract = {{Over the last century Extreme Value Theory (EVT) has become an
   established collection of statistical methods for estimating the tails
   of distributions in a wide range of academic disciplines. In addition,
   the practice of over-bounding the tail probabilities, typically using
   Gaussian distributions, has been developed in recent years for modeling
   system uncertainty. This paper analyzes and implements the combination
   of EVT estimation using the Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) and
   conservative overbounding. Moreover, quantifying the uncertainties of
   EVT estimation is paramount for successfully constructing overbounds.
   Our work primarily investigates these uncertainties through Monte Carlo
   simulations of a variety of distributions. After characterizing these
   uncertainties, an EVT-based overbounding approach is presented for a
   simple linear system. The results of this work show that an EVT-based
   approach can generate conservative overbounds using significantly less
   data than experiments alone.}},

   from partial observations. We consider covariance matrices modeled as

   missing values. In the absence of missing data, observation vectors are
   assumed to be i.i.d multivariate Gaussian. In particular, we propose a
   new procedure computationally affordable in high dimension to extend an
   existing permuted rank-penalized least-squares method to the case of
   missing data. Our approach is applicable to a large variety of missing
   data mechanisms, whether the process generating missing values is random
   or not, and does not require imputation techniques. We introduce a novel
   unbiased estimator and characterize its convergence rate to the true
   covariance matrix measured by the spectral norm of a permutation
   operator. We establish a tight outer bound on the square error of our
   estimate, and elucidate consequences of missing values on the estimation
   performance. Different schemes are compared by numerical simulations in
   order to test our proposed estimator.}},

Abstract = {{Estimating the power spectrum of a wide-sense stationary stochastic
   process is a core component of several signal processing tasks.
   Distributed spectrum sensing problems naturally emerge in cases where
   measurements of different realizations of a stochastic process are
   collected at multiple spatial locations. This paper describes a
   distributed power spectrum sensing scheme for stochastic processes which
   are well represented by an autoregressive (AR) process. The sensing
   model comprises a network of scattered low-end sensors which transmit
   randomly filtered, one bit quantized power measurements to a fusion
   center. The problem of AR power spectrum estimation from such binary
   power measurements is cast as a non-convex optimization problem, and an
   alternating minimization algorithm is proposed to obtain a stationary
   point. Simulations showcase the effectiveness of this scheme when the AR
   parametrization is valid.}},

Abstract = {{Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) has been recognized
   as an efficient approach for solving many large-scale learning problems
   over a computer cluster. However, traditional synchronized computation
   does not scale well with the problem size, as the speed of the algorithm
   is limited by the slowest workers. In this paper, we propose an
   asynchronous distributed ADMM (AD-ADMM) which can effectively improve
   the time efficiency of distributed optimization. Our main interest lies
   in characterizing the convergence conditions of the AD-ADMM, under the
   popular partially asynchronous model which is defined based on a maximum
   tolerable delay in the network. Specifically, by considering general and
   possibly non-convex cost functions, we show that the AD-ADMM converges
   to the set of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points as long as the algorithm
   parameters are chosen appropriately according to the network delay. We
   also show that the asynchrony of ADMM has to be handled with care, as a
   slightly different implementation can significantly jeopardize the
   algorithm convergence.}},

Abstract = {{Big data applications demand efficient solvers capable of providing
   accurate solutions to large-scale problems at affordable computational
   costs. Processing data sequentially, online algorithms offer attractive
   means to deal with massive data sets. However, they may incur
   prohibitive complexity in high-dimensional scenarios if the entire data
   set is processed. It is therefore necessary to confine computations to
   an informative subset. While existing approaches have focused on
   selecting a prescribed fraction of the available data vectors, the
   present paper capitalizes on this degree of freedom to accelerate the
   convergence of a generic class of online algorithms in terms of
   processing time/computational resources by balancing the required burden
   with a metric of how informative each datum is. The proposed method is
   illustrated in a linear regression setting, and simulations corroborate
   the superior convergence rate of the recursive least-squares algorithm
   when the novel data selection is effected.}},

Abstract = {{Partial correlations (PCs) of functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) time series play a principal role in revealing connectivity of
   brain networks. To explore nonlinear behavior of the blood-oxygen-level
   dependent signal, the present work postulates a kernel-based nonlinear
   connectivity model based on which it obtains topology revealing PCs.
   Instead of relying on a single predefined kernel, a data-driven approach
   is advocated to learn the combination of multiple kernel functions that
   optimizes the data fit. Synthetically generated data based on both a
   dynamic causal and a linear model are used to validate the proposed
   approach in resting-state fMRI scenarios, highlighting the gains in edge
   detection performance when compared with the popular linear PC method.
   Tests on real fMRI data demonstrate that connectivity patterns revealed
   by linear and nonlinear models are different.}},

   etch-released membranes and microstructure was measured for carbon
   microparticles on LPCVD silicon nitride thin films and suspended

   ablate the contaminants. Microscope images of the membranes showed mass
   removal for an irradiance as low as 600W cm(-2). More thorough cleaning
   was achieved by increasing the irradiance. For 2.5x2.5mm, 205nm thin
   silicon nitride membranes, 79\% of the contaminated area was removed
   with an exposure of 3.7kW cm(-2). Catastrophic damage was seen at a
   power level of 8.4kW cm(-2). Ablation effects were also measured as a
   change in optical absorption using a photo thermal common-path
   interferometer. Peak absorption values were decreased from over
   100,000ppm to less than 20,000ppm. Silicon nitride platforms were also

Abstract = {{Today, many organizations need to operate on data that is distributed
   around the globe. This is inevitable due to the nature of data that is
   generated in different locations such as video feeds from distributed
   cameras, log files from distributed servers, and many others. Although
   centralized cloud platforms have been widely used for data-intensive
   applications, such systems are not suitable for processing
   geo-distributed data due to high data transfer overheads. An alternative
   approach is to use an Edge Cloud which reduces the network cost of
   transferring data by distributing its computations globally. While the
   Edge Cloud is attractive for geo-distributed data-intensive
   applications, extending existing cluster computing frameworks to a
   wide-area environment must account for locality. We propose Awan : a new
   locality-aware resource manager for geo-distributed data-intensive
   applications. Awan allows resource sharing between multiple computing
   frameworks while enabling high locality scheduling within each
   framework. Our experiments with the Nebula Edge Cloud on PlanetLab show
   that Awan achieves up to a 28\% increase in locality scheduling which
   reduces the average job turnaround time by approximately 18\% compared
   to existing cluster management mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{The use of active modes of travel in school trips has sharply declined
   for a number of reasons, some of which are rooted in urban design,
   location of schools, and parental reservations. Thus, policy makers are
   keen to find practical ways to promote active modes of travel,
   particularly walking. This study was an effort to determine a tolerable
   walking distance for school trips and identify factors that made walking
   trips more reasonable for students. In the vein of understanding the
   tolerable walking distance, a two-step framework encompassing a random
   utility method and a hazard-based model was introduced. This framework
   was applied to a set of data that were collected from middle and high
   school students in the city of Tehran, Iran. The framework was intended
   to find a more accurate estimate of tolerable walking distance in school
   trips by addressing data censorship problems. The hazard-based model
   showed that 85\% of students failed to walk when their travel distance
   exceeded 1,900 m. In Western countries, some studies have found this
   distance to be around 1,500 m. This study found girls were less likely
   to walk compared with boys. Furthermore, safety, time, and comfort of
   the trip turned out to be influential in parental objections, such that
   they decrease the critical walking distance by 18\%, 13\%, and 11\%,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Atrial Fibrillation (AF), a most common cardiac arrhythmia affects more
   than 2.3 million people in the US and associated with increased risk of
   stroke, heart failure and death. Cather ablation to treat paroxysmal AF
   patients is somewhat successful with challenges remaining to accurately
   identify the active sites for persistent AF patients which may occur
   outside the pulmonary vein (PV) region due to inadequate cardiac mapping
   systems. In this work, the authors propose an Empirical Mode
   Decomposition (EMD) approach using multi-scale entropy estimates of the
   intrinsic mode functions as a complexity measure to accurately identify
   pivot point of the rotor that were induced in ex-vivo isolated rabbit
   heart with Ventricular Tachycardia (VT). The new approach using EMD
   demonstrated successful identification of the rotor core region
   providing better contrast relative to the periphery region. Validation
   of the EMD approach using intra-atrial electrograms from paroxysmal and
   persistent AF patients with rotors is required to accurately identify
   the rotor pivot point to guide AF ablation.}},

Abstract = {{The hydrolysis of cellulose and beta(1 -> 4) oligosaccharides on carbon
   catalysts is a promising approach for the selective production of
   glucose from cellulose and its derivatives. In this study, a
   structure-property relationship was developed for the hydrolysis of
   water soluble glucan oligomers over three dimensionally ordered
   mesoporous (3DOm) carbon with sulfonic acid groups. It was found that
   the number of sulfonic acid groups on 3DOm carbon catalysts and their
   adsorption properties need to be optimized to maximize the hydrolysis of
   water soluble glucan oligomers. The adsorption capacity of glucan
   oligomers on 3DOm carbon increases with their chain length, which can be
   attributed to two molecular behaviors: (a) long glucan oligomers
   adsorbed on the carbon surface exhibit a dense packing structure
   compared with relatively small glucan oligomers; and (b) a part of a
   glucan oligomer ``dangles{''} off the carbon surface due to its branched
   structure. It was found that the adsorption enthalpy and entropy
   increased with increasing the chain length of the glucan oligomers,
   which favors the hydrolysis reaction to produce glucose over the carbon
   catalysts.}},

Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{70}},

Pages = {{485-502}},
Abstract = {{Turbulent fluid flows with a swirl occur in numerous engineering
   practice situations. Five widely recognized turbulence models were
   evaluated using experimental results. Among the RANS-based two-equation
   models, the SST k-omega model proved to be the most effective. The
   predictions obtained from a LES turbulence model were slightly better,
   however there was an enormous difference in the CPU time. The CPU time
   needed for the LES solution was 155.3 days, whereas it was only 14.2
   days for the SST k-omega solution. In this light, it is believed that
   the SST k-omega model is the most efficient of those investigated. An
   important input for the numerical simulation of turbulent flow and heat
   transfer is the turbulence intensity at the inlet of a solution domain.
   For the evaluation of turbulence models, use was made of the measured
   turbulence quantities from the verification experiments. More often,
   simulations are executed based on the uniform values of the turbulence
   intensity across the inlet. The errors in the heat transfer results due
   to this practice are evaluated and are shown to be significant.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter introduces the foundation for surveillance and security
   robots for multiple military and civilian applications. The key
   environmental domains are mobile robots for ground, aerial, surface
   water, and underwater applications. Surveillance literally means to
   watch from above, while surveillance robots are used to monitor the
   behavior, activities, and other changing information that are gathered
   for the general purpose of managing, directing, or protecting one's
   assets or position. In a practical sense, the term surveillance is taken
   to mean the act of observation from a distance, and security robots are
   commonly used to protect and safeguard a location, some valuable assets,
   or personal against danger, damage, loss, and crime. Surveillance is a
   proactive operation, while security robots are a defensive operation.
   The construction of each type of robot is similar in nature with a
   mobility component, sensor payload, communication system, and an
   operator control station. After introducing the major robot components,
   this chapter focuses on the various applications. More specifically,
   Sect. 61.3 discusses the enabling technologies of mobile robot
   navigation, various payload sensors used for surveillance or security
   applications, target detection and tracking algorithms, and the
   operator's robot control console for human-machine interface (HMI).
   Section 61.4 presents selected research activities relevant to
   surveillance and security, including automatic data processing of the
   payload sensors, automatic monitoring of human activities, facial
   recognition, and collaborative automatic target recognition (ATR).
   Finally, Sect. 61.5 discusses future directions in robot surveillance
   and security, giving some conclusions and followed by references.}},

Abstract = {{Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a type I transmembrane
   aspartyl protease. In the amyloidogenic pathway, BACE1 provides
   beta-secretase activity that cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP)
   that leads to amyloid beta (A beta) peptides. The aggregation of these A
   beta will ultimately results in amyloid plaque formation, a hallmark of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid aggregation leads to progressive
   memory impairment and neural loss. Recent detergent protein extraction
   studies suggest that the untreated BACE1 protein forms a dimer that has
   significantly higher catalytic activity than its monomeric counterpart.
   Here, we examine the dimerization hypothesis of BACE1 in cultured HEK293
   cells using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS). Cells were
   transfected with a BACE1-EGFP fusion protein construct and imaged using
   confocal and DIC microscopy to monitor labeled BACE1 localization and
   distribution within the cell. Our one-photon fluorescence fluctuation
   autocorrelation of BACE1-EGFP on the plasma membrane of HEK cells is
   modeled using two diffusing species on the plasma membrane with
   estimated diffusion coefficients of 1.39 x 10(-7) cm(2)/sec and 2.8 x
   10(-8) cm(2)/sec under resting conditions and STA-200 inhibition,
   respectively. Anomalous diffusion model also provided adequate
   description of the observed autocorrelation function of BACE1-EGFP on
   the plasma membrane with an estimate exponent (alpha) of 0.8 and 0.5 for
   resting and STA-200 treated cells, respectively. The corresponding
   hydrodynamic radius of this transmembrane fusion protein was estimated
   using the measured diffusion coefficients assuming both Stokes-Einstein
   and Saffman-Delbruck models. Our results suggest a complex diffusion
   pattern of BACE1-EGFP on the plasma membrane of HEK cells with the
   possibility for dimer formation, especially under STA-200 inhibition.}},

Abstract = {{An open end drive configuration utilizing a transformer isolated single
   phase high frequency ac link is presented. A high frequency ac link
   enables the use of a compact and light weight transformer to provide
   voltage transformation and galvanic isolation while the open end
   configuration leads to an improved utilization of the ac link. The
   desired output is synthesized using dual cycloconverters modulated using
   a space vector technique that has been modified to work with a high
   frequency ac link and leads to single stage conversion. Any change in
   the switch states is restricted to the zero crossings of the ac link to
   achieve zero voltage switching in the cycloconverters. The topology
   described also has the advantage of achieving natural commutation of
   leakage energy in the transformer windings and avoids the need for
   additional circuits to achieve the same. The proposed drive is simulated
   using MATLAB/Simulink and the results are discussed. A hardware
   prototype has been constructed to demonstrate the implementation of the
   proposed drive.}},

Abstract = {{Common-mode voltage (CMV) generated by semiconductor switching causes
   stray currents and mechanical failure in modern drive systems. Solutions
   employed to attenuate or isolate the common-mode voltage (CMV) require
   additional components, and may still fail to eliminate the detrimental
   effects. Matrix converter based open-end winding drives, when modulated
   using synchronous vectors, do not generate CMV to begin with.
   Additionally, these drives do not rely upon a large DC capacitor that is
   used in the state-of-the-art systems; and are therefore expected to be
   more compact and reliable. This paper will present prototypes of two
   distinct indirect matrix converter based open-end winding drives that
   eliminate output common-mode voltage, provide high voltage transfer
   ratio (up to 1.5), and allow input power factor control. These indirect
   drives have the additional advantages of clamp circuit elimination,
   lower voltage stress on the devices, naturally intelligent commutation,
   and natural low-voltage ride-through integration over their direct
   matrix converter counterpart. Experimental evidence of the voltage
   transfer ratio and input power factor control will be provided. Compared
   to 2-level and 3-level inverters, significant reduction in the CMV
   induced shaft voltage and ground currents will be shown. An optimal
   third-order grid filter applicable to all matrix converter based drives
   will also be discussed. This filter will be used with the presented
   drives to validate its superior performance.}},

Abstract = {{A systematic method of designing a zero-ripple Cuk converter for
   PV/Battery-to-grid applications is presented in this paper. The
   integrated magnetic core design uses an intuitive flux-reluctance model
   to arrive at the Area Product for this kind of structure. Unlike the
   earlier designs for this converter, it provides a completely analytical
   approach to design this converter for a range of specifications. The
   target application is grid interface of PV or battery. The validity of
   the proposed method is confirmed using finite element analyses (both 2-D
   and 3-D), circuit simulations in pspice as well as preliminary
   experimental validation.}},

Abstract = {{MOSFETs built using wide band gap (WBG) materials offer numerous
   benefits to power electronic circuits. These benefits are quite apparent
   in applications requiring breakdown voltages >= 600 V, where Silicon
   IGBTs are typically used due to their combination of high breakdown
   voltage and low conduction losses. Compared to Silicon IGBTs, WBG
   MOSFETs offer very short turn-ON and turn-OFF times, which reduce
   switching losses and enable significantly higher switching frequencies.
   This paper explores the application of WBG MOSFETs to motor drives,
   where higher switching frequencies reduce motor losses and torque ripple
   and allow higher control bandwidth, thus enabling greater output
   frequencies needed to operate motors at higher speeds. Specifically,
   two-level voltage source inverters utilizing Silicon Carbide (SiC)
   MOSFETs are constructed to operate a 1 HP induction motor. Experimental
   results are presented which show that the short turn-ON and turn-OFF
   transients as well as high switching frequencies lead to increased shaft
   voltage and conducted ground currents. Mitigation techniques are
   implemented and evaluated, including clamp-on ferrites and an open-end
   winding drive implementation. The shaft voltage and ground currents are
   found to be best suppressed in an open-end winding drive utilizing
   clamp-on ferrites.}},

Abstract = {{Computing with nano-chip technologies spans highly different
   applications. The corresponding processor-chips span a range of 1000: 1
   in performance and in their energy-efficiency. From 2010 to 2014, their
   performance per product-unit almost doubled every year, while their
   energy efficiency doubled only every three years, so that their total
   power consumption quadrupled in three years. With the evidence of this
   energy crisis, the projections for 2015-2020 have been corrected
   somewhat to a global performance improvement of 20-times in 5 years,
   while the energy efficiency shall improve an optimistic 7-times in 5
   years, which would raise the total required wall-plug power another
   3-times, an unlikely scenario, accompanied by a ``Green{''} movement.
   This ``green{''} strategy lowers the energy per operation by reducing
   the operating voltage. However, this reduces the operations per second
   so much that, wherever the completion of operations in a given time is
   an issue, more computing units would have to be run in parallel, with a
   worse balance in required hardware and energy. Therefore, GREEN is not
   enough. A new throughput figure-of-merit sheds new light on the task of
   simultaneously improving performance and energy-efficiency, demanding
   disruptive innovations.}},

Abstract = {{News and trends in data storage have advanced to dominate technology and
   market headlines. They confirm many of the assessments in CHIPS 2020:
   The low-energy, high-speed static random-access memory (SRAM) with a
   6-8-transistor cell is the digital chip function with the lowest supply
   voltage (< 500 mV), the most advanced node on the nanometer roadmap (14
   nm), and the potentially most robust nano-circuit due to its fully
   differential operation. The workhorse DRAM, dynamic RAM, advances only
   slowly, and, as predicted, is stuck at supply voltages > 1 V and
   technology nodes > 20 nm. The overall technology driver is the
   non-volatile NAND-Flash memory. While its minimum transistor length
   progresses to 16 nm, the vertical-channel, monolithic 3D transistor
   integration on-chip and the 3D TSV stacking of > 30 chips have produced
   transistor densities of > 10(11)/cm(2) and memory densities > 300
   Gb/cm(2), reaching the prediction in Fig. 11.1 of CHIPS 2020. The
   corollary of this achievement is a powerful technology arsenal for 3D
   integration, not only of memories, and for the extension of Moore's law
   in terms of transistors/cm(2). The non-volatile-memory alternatives to
   NAND Flash continue their competition in the battlefield of
   programming/writing with thermally induced resistance-or phase-changes.
   In terms of density as well as write and read speed, the resistive RAM
   (ReRAM), in the meantime, has made the biggest progress, and it has
   passed the PCM (phase-change memory). The process compatibility of the
   ReRAM as a back-end process to CMOS mainstream, as well as its speed and
   better data retention, make it the technology alternative for
   non-volatile RAM versus the NAND Flash.

Abstract = {{The advancement of nanoelectronic functionality and memory capacity has
   enabled a data explosion, which is promoted as ``Big Data{''}, and
   doubling the mobile Internet traffic every 18 months. In this fashion,
   the mobile Internet would need over 500 GW of electric power for its
   operation in 2020 and another 500 GW of embodied power for its
   manufacturing, maintenance, recycling, and disposal, together one third
   of the expected total global electric power generation. In the face of
   this unlikely scenario, a review proposes that this ``Big Data{''} is a
   result of the artificial, numerical, linear world, inflated by the
   pocket calculator in the 60s and its successors and now out of control
   due to linear digital video originated by the CCD imagers since the 70s
   and mapped onto CMOS imagers. By contrast, we (and our brains) sense our
   world with a logarithmic response, where minimum response steps record
   signal increments that are constant ratios of the magnitude of the
   individual signal. This has been recognized in digital audio, where it
   led to MP3 as an intelligent data compression. This realism is still
   missing in digital video, which causes >70 \% of the mobile Internet
   traffic. Transistor-enabled logarithmic recording, invented 1992, and
   processing of images can compress video data by an order-of-magnitude
   vs. present mainstream digital video, a significant saving on video
   traffic and storage. A similar progress from ``data{''} to information
   can be envisioned towards real data on the ``Internet for Everything{''}
   like the environment, health, weather, mobility, and robotics.}},

Abstract = {{Vision chips continue to aggressively follow the complexity of

   video data is about to flood the Internet, where video already exceeds
   70 \% of the traffic and > 90 \% of the data stored. On the other hand,
   high-sensitivity, high-dynamic-range CMOS (HDRC) human-vision-inspired
   sensors have maintained pixel sizes of 25 mu m(2) for ASA 12.800
   sensitivity and 1000-by-2000 pixels complexity as well as high-speed
   global-shutter read-out. HDRC two-and three-chip stereo cameras have
   become key components for safe and intelligent man-machine cooperation.
   New compression standards will be needed. More efficient in the long run
   will be a fundamental review of electronic vision, following human
   vision with its incredible compression skills. Remarkable benefits from
   nm technology nodes were achieved for high-resolution time-of-flight

Abstract = {{This paper deals with coordination control of a 3 DOF lifting system
   with human power amplification, taking passivity control into account to
   ensure safety interactions between human and object. A scissor mechanism
   based lifting system is designed to achieve compactness while an
   accumulator-pump/motor-cylinder architecture is employed to save
   electric energy from DC motor and recover potential energy during load
   descending. Dynamics of mechanical systems as well as electrohydraulic
   drive unit is modeled mathematically. Control system is designed with
   equivalent master/slave coordination control strategy to address the
   issue existing in human assistive operation and the controller for the
   DC motor is designed with back-stepping algorithm. By applying the idea
   of the shape and locked systems, the control objective is achieved
   successfully and the system passivity condition is satisfied
   consequently by introducing a fictitious flywheel virtually connected
   with the controller to perform energy storage. Simulation results show
   that the proposed coordination control strategy for multi-objects is
   applicable to implement the position and attitude control of the lifting
   system and the coordination control issue can be dealt with successfully
   even in the presence of sudden load disturbance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates an on-demand spatial service broker for
   suggesting service provider propositions and the corresponding estimated
   waiting times to mobile consumers while meeting the consumer's maximum
   travel distance and waiting time constraints. The goal of the broker is
   to maximize the number of matched requests while also keeping the
   ``eco-system{''} functioning by engaging many service providers and
   balancing their assigned requests to provide them with incentives to
   stay in the system. This problem is important because of its many
   related societal applications in the on demand and sharing economy (e.g.
   on-demand ride hailing services, on-demand food delivery, etc).
   Challenges of this problem include the need to satisfy many conflicting
   requirements for the broker, consumers and service providers and the
   high computational complexity for a large number of consumers and
   service providers. Related work in spatial crowdsourcing and ridesharing
   has mainly focused on maximizing the number of matched requests and
   minimizing travel cost, but did not consider the importance of engaging
   more service providers and balancing their assignments, which could
   become a priority when the available supply exceeds the demand. In this
   work, we propose a new category of service provider centric heuristics
   for meeting these conflicting requirements. We evaluated our algorithms
   using synthetic datasets with real-world characteristics. Experimental
   results show that our proposed heuristics can achieve a larger number of
   matched requests when supply and demand are balanced. They also engage a
   larger number of service providers with a more balanced provider
   assignment when the available supply greatly exceeds demand.}},

Abstract = {{Switched Inertance Hydraulic Systems (SIHS) use inductive, capacitive,
   and switching elements to boost or buck a pressure from a source to a
   load in an ideally lossless manner. Real SIHS circuits suffer a variety
   of energy losses, with throttling of flow during transitions of the
   high-speed valve resulting in 44\% of overall losses. These throttling
   energy losses can be mitigated by applying the analog of zero-voltage
   switching, a soft switching strategy, adopted from power electronics. In
   the soft switching circuit, the flow that would otherwise be throttled
   across the transitioning valve is stored in a capacitive element and
   bypassed through check valves in parallel with the switching valves. To
   evaluate the effectiveness of soft switching in a boost converter SIHS,
   a lumped parameter model was constructed. The model demonstrates that
   soft switching can improve the efficiency of the circuit up to 42\% and
   extend the power delivery capabilities of the circuit by 76\%.}},

Abstract = {{The lack of certain types of geographic data prevents the development of
   location-aware technologies in a number of important domains. One such
   type of ``unmapped{''} geographic data is space usage rules (SURs),
   which are defined as geographically-bound activity restrictions (e.g.
   ``no dogs{''}, ``no smoking{''}, ``no fishing{''}, no
   skateboarding{''}). Researchers in the area of human-computer
   interaction have recently begun to develop techniques for the automated
   mapping of SURs with the aim of supporting activity planning systems
   (e.g. one-touch ``Can I Smoke Here?{''} apps, SUR-aware vacation
   planning tools). In this paper, we present a novel SUR mapping technique
   - SPtP - that outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by 30\% for one of
   the most important components of the SUR mapping pipeline: associating a
   point observation of a SUR (e.g. a `no smoking' sign) with the
   corresponding polygon in which the SUR applies (e.g. the nearby park or
   the entire campus on which the sign is located). This paper also
   contributes a series of new SUR benchmark datasets to help further
   research in this area.}},

Abstract = {{Two rapidly evolving technologies are set to intersect at the crossroads
   of the future of medicine: the knowledge of how to induce and maintain
   cellular pluripotency, and the ability to precisely manipulate the
   genome with engineered nucleases. Together, these two advances have
   significant potential in the development of the next generation of cell
   and gene therapies. This review will discuss human and animal models of
   stem cells and the application of engineered nucleases for precision
   gene targeting and control. For animal studies and models, nucleases
   have allowed for greater flexibility and expandability. Previously
   untargetable regions of the murine genome are now accessible via
   engineered nucleases. Prior to the availability of gene editing
   proteins, the entire rat genome was largely refractory to gene targeting
   and manipulation. The ability to engineer larger animals may reduce the
   transplant organ gap and increase the yields of food for an expanding
   population. Lastly, the ability to modify stem cells of hematopoietic,
   embryonic, or somatic origin will allow for more relevant disease
   modeling, and more targeted and effective therapies. Collectively, the
   efficiency of gene editing nucleases and the ability to apply them
   across cells of multiple species allows for new research opportunities,
   more flexibility, and greater accuracy in choosing the model best suited
   for genome manipulation.}},

Abstract = {{A heat exchanger and the fluid mover that delivers a working fluid to

   exchanger inlet is specifiable without consideration of any possible
   influence of the exchanger. The magnitude of the flow rate arriving at
   the exchanger inlet is generally based on the pressure rise-flow rate
   (P-Q) curve supplied by the manufacturer of the fan and coupled with the
   assumption that that flow is uniformly distributed across the exchanger
   inlet. It was found that the complexity of the fluid flow delivered by
   the rotating fan gives rise to a large fluid resistance within the
   pin-fin array, such that the delivered air flow rate was only about 37\%
   of that for the P-Q case. On the other hand, the corresponding reduction
   in the rate of heat transfer was, at most, 27\%.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, flow and heat transfer of a swirl chamber that models an

Abstract = {{Here we demonstrate a novel approach for fabricating point of care (POC)
   wearable electrochemical biosensors based on 3D patterning of
   bionanocomposite networks. To create Bio-Inspired Patterned network
   (BIPS) electrodes, we first generate fractal network in silico models
   that optimize transport of network fluxes according to an energy
   function. Network patterns are then inkjet printed onto flexible
   substrate using conductive graphene ink. We then deposit fractal
   nanometal structures onto the graphene to create a 3D nanocomposite
   network. Finally, we biofunctionalize the surface with biorecognition
   agents using covalent bonding. In this paper, BIPS are used to develop
   high efficiency, low cost biosensors for measuring glucose as a proof of
   concept. Our results on the fundamental performance of BIPS sensors show
   that the biomimetic nanostructures significantly enhance biosensor
   sensitivity, accuracy, response time, limit of detection, and hysteresis
   compared to conventional POC non fractal electrodes (serpentine,
   interdigitated, and screen printed electrodes). BIPs, in particular
   Apollonian patterned BIPS, represent a new generation of POC biosensors
   based on nanoscale and microscale fractal networks that significantly
   improve electrical connectivity, leading to enhanced sensor performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the development of a simple and effective procedure
   to derive truck route choice data from large streams of truck GPS data.
   At the heart of this procedure is a map-matching algorithm that is easy
   to implement. The proposed procedure is applicable to large data sets
   with varying frequencies between consecutive GPS records that range from
   once every second to once every 20 min. As a demonstration, the
   procedure is employed to derive routes for more than 78,000 truck trips
   from a large GPS data set. The derived routes are validated to
   demonstrate the accuracy of the results. The paper also introduces a
   useful metric for the measurement of the overlap between the travel path
   of one trip and that of another trip between a given origin destination
   (O-D) pair. In addition, the paper discusses a procedure to employ the
   metric in the measurement of the diversity (or variability) of routes
   across several trips between a given O-D pair and to identify the set of
   unique routes used between the O-D pair.}},

   Axonal Conduction}},
Journal = {{BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{19-24}},
Abstract = {{Multiple sclerosis is a disease caused by demyelination of nerve fibers.
   In order to determine the loss of signal with the percentage of
   demyelination, we need to develop models that can simulate this effect.
   Existing time-based models does not provide a method to determine the
   influences of demyelination based on simulation results. Our goal is to
   develop a system identification approach to generate a transfer function
   in the frequency domain. The idea is to create a unified modeling
   approach for neural action potential propagation along the length of an
   axon containing number of Nodes of Ranvier (N). A system identification
   approach has been used to identify a transfer function of the classical
   Hodgkin-Huxley equations for membrane voltage potential. Using this
   approach, we model cable properties and signal propagation along the
   length of the axon with N node myelination. MATLAB/Simulink platform is
   used to analyze an N node-myelinated neuronal axon. The ability to
   transfer function in the frequency domain will help reduce effort and
   will give a much more realistic feel when compared to the classical
   time-based approach. Once a transfer function is identified, the
   conduction as a cascade of each linear time invariant system-based
   transfer function can be modeled. Using this approach, future studies
   can model the loss of myelin in various parts of nervous system.}},

Title = {{A multiphysics model of the Pacinian corpuscle}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Pages = {{1111-1125}},
Abstract = {{The Pacinian corpuscle (PC) is a dermal mechanoreceptor that responds to
   high-frequency (20-1000 Hz) vibrations. The PC's structure allows
   transmission of vibrations through its layers (lamellae) to the
   centrally-located nerve fiber (neurite). This work combines mechanical
   models of the PC with an electrochemical model of peripheral nerves to
   simulate the tactile response of the entire system. A three-stage model
   of response to a vibratory input was developed, consisting of (1) outer
   core mechanics, (2) inner core mechanics, and (3) neurite
   electrochemistry. The model correctly predicts the band-pass nature of
   the PC's frequency response, showing that the PC structure can amplify
   oscillatory strains within its target frequency band. Specifically,
   strain induced by a vibratory stimulus is amplified by a factor of 8-12
   from the PC surface to the neurite. Our results also support the
   hypothesis that PC rapid adaptation is affected by the lamellar
   structures without requiring neuronal adaptivity. Simulated
   different-sized PCs showed a shift in frequency response, suggesting
   that clusters of different-sized PCs could enable more nuanced tactile
   encoding than uniform clusters. By modeling the PC's mechano-to-neural
   transduction, we can begin to characterize the mechanosensation of other
   receptors to understand how multiple receptors interact to create our
   sensation of touch.}},

Abstract = {{Printable energy storage is anticipated to facilitate innovation in the
   manufacture of flexible electronics and soft robotics by enabling direct
   integration of a power source into a system during the fabrication
   process. To this end, we have established a universal approach to
   develop 3D printable, free-standing electrodes with an embedded current
   collector for high-performance Li-ion batteries. This simple approach
   utilizes a well-dispersed mixture of active material, carbon nanofibers,
   and polymer to make castable or printable electrode inks. By tuning the
   ratios of these components in a series of inks, we have observed the
   effect each parameter had on the resulting rheological, electrochemical,
   and mechanical properties. Once properly balanced, free-standing
   electrodes of three common Li-ion battery active materials (i.e.,
   lithium titanate (Li4Ti5O12), lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4), and
   lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO2)) were prepared, each demonstrating
   excellent cyclability and rate capability. Finally, electrodes were
   successfully patterned using a direct ink writing method, and a
   fully-printed, working electrode plus separator electrode assembly were
   developed.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric nanomaterials have many important and unique properties
   which make them suitable for a wide range of applications including

   renewable energy sources. ZnO nanostructures have been widely studied
   for energy harvesting due to their enhanced piezoelectricity and
   scalable, reproducible synthesis techniques. Single atomic layer MoS2 is
   an emerging material for energy harvesting due to the existence of
   piezoelectric properties not found in the bulk material. Bio-inspired
   piezoelectric materials such as peptide nanotubes have excellent
   mechanical properties and are promising candidates for nanogenerator
   devices. Many different nanogenerator architectures have been developed

Pages = {{900-910}},
Abstract = {{A comprehensive study was performed to quantify the risk of burns from
   hot beverage spills. The study was comprised of three parts. First,
   experiments were carried out to measure the cooling rates of beverages
   in a room-temperature environment by natural convection and thermal
   radiation. The experiments accounted for different beverage volumes,
   initial temperatures, cooling period between the time of service and the
   spill, the material which comprised the cup, the presence or absence of
   a cap and the presence or absence of an insulating corrugated paper
   sleeve. Among this list, the parameters which most influenced the
   temperature variation was the presence or absence of a cover or cap, the
   volume of the beverage and the duration of the cooling period. The
   second step was a series of experiments that provided temperatures at
   the surface of skin or skin surrogate after a spill. The experiments
   incorporated a single layer of cotton clothing and the exposure duration
   was 30s. The outcomes of the experiments were used as input to a
   numerical model which calculated the temperature distribution and burn
   depth within tissue. Last was the implementation of the numerical model
   and a catalogue of burn predictions for various beverage volumes,
   beverage service temperatures, and durations between beverage service
   and spill. It is hoped that this catalogue can be used by both beverage
   industries and consumers to reduce the threat of burn injuries. It can
   also be used by treating medical professionals who can quickly estimate
   burn depths following a spill incident.}},

Abstract = {{Graph partitioning is important in distributing workloads on parallel
   compute systems, computing sparse matrix re-orderings, and designing
   VLSI circuits. Refinement algorithms are used to improve existing

   partitionings. Existing parallel refinement algorithms either extract
   concurrency by sacrificing in terms of quality, or preserve quality by
   restricting concurrency. In this work we present a new shared-memory
   parallel algorithm for refining an existing k-way partitioning that can
   break out of local minima and produce high-quality partitionings. This
   allows our algorithm to scale well in terms of the number of processing
   cores and produce clusterings of quality equal to serial algorithms. Our
   algorithm achieves speedups of 5.7-16.7x using 24 cores, while
   exhibiting only 0.52\% higher edgecuts than when run serially. This is
   6.3x faster and 1.9\% better quality than other parallel refinement
   algorithms which can break out of local minima.}},

Abstract = {{This research aims at the design of a circuit to provide power supply to
   every element in a sensor array in a scanning style for the data
   acquisition with very few wires. It is useful in data acquisition when
   there is a need of large amount of wires, but without enough space to
   hold these wires. It will make a sensing system practical by
   considerably reducing the number of the wires, especially for the
   application to a tubular-shape force sensor array on a long tubular
   device such as a colonoscope due to very limited available space for
   running too many wires. In the application of the designed circuit to a
   sensor array of 16 columns and 445 rows in a colonoscope, it has been
   achieved that only 19 wires were used for the data acquisition for all
   the 7120 sensing elements. Without this circuit, at least 461 wires are
   needed as explained in the paper. In this paper, the design of the
   circuit was explained first. Then the outputs of the circuit were
   simulated using a software package and experimentally verified using PCB
   boards. Two of the PCB boards has been built and tested on a sensor
   array with graphical display of the applied force. One of the final
   goals of this project is to be used in a skin sensor array for
   colonoscope to avoid bowel perforation which is a life threatening
   complication during a colonoscopy.}},

Pages = {{A3020-A3045}},
Abstract = {{We present a method for computing partial spectra of Hermitian matrices,
   based on a combination of subspace iteration with rational filtering. In
   contrast with classical rational filters derived from Cauchy integrals
   or from uniform approximations to a step function, we adopt a
   least-squares (LS) viewpoint for designing filters. One of the goals of
   the proposed approach is to build a filter that will lead to linear
   systems that are easier to solve by iterative methods. Among the main
   advantages of the proposed LS filters is their flexibility. Thus, we can
   place poles in more general locations than with the formulations
   mentioned above, and we can also repeat these poles a few times for
   better efficiency. This leads to a smaller number of required poles than
   in existing methods. As a consequence, factorization costs are reduced
   when direct solvers are used and the scheme is also beneficial for
   iterative solvers. The paper discusses iterative schemes to solve the
   linear systems resulting from the filtered subspace iteration that take
   advantage of the nature and structure of the proposed LS filters. The
   efficiency and robustness of the resulting method is illustrated with a
   few model problems as well as several Hamiltonian matrices from
   electronic structure calculations.}},

Abstract = {{How much margin do we have to add to the delay lines of a bundled-data
   circuit? This paper is an attempt to give a methodical answer to this
   question, taking into account all sources of variability and the
   existing EDA machinery for timing analysis and sign-off. The paper is
   based on the study of the margins of a ring oscillator that substitutes
   a PLL as clock generator. A timing model is proposed that shows that a
   12\% margin for delay lines can be sufficient to cover variability in a
   65nm technology. In a typical scenario, performance and energy
   improvements between 15\% and 35\% can be obtained by using a ring
   oscillator instead of a PLL. The paper concludes that a synchronous
   circuit with a ring oscillator clock shows similar benefits in
   performance and energy as those of bundled-data asynchronous circuits.}},

Abstract = {{With the development of multimedia and Internet of things technologies,
   technology enhanced learning applications such as smart class and smart
   learning at home have received more attentions from industrial and
   academic communities. However, pervasive wireless communications, which
   builds new collaborative and personalized learning patterns, have an
   important impact on learning and teaching. For current pervasive
   wireless networks, spectrum resources become increasing lack due to the
   introduction of a large number of newwireless technologies and thus the
   access of many newdevices to wireless networks for all kinds of
   applications such as online smart learning. How to exploit effectively
   spectrum resources in current pervasive wireless networks is a larger
   challenge. To this end, we study dynamic access problem for spectrum
   resources. In this paper, we analyze more complex multiple channel model
   with multiple primary and secondary users. We exploit the lognormal
   distribution to characterize primary user behaviors and use
   opportunistic spectrum access to obtain the sensing status of channels.
   To raise the channel utility, we control transmission radiuses of
   secondary users to make primary and secondary users simultaneously
   utilize the channel. Finally, we propose the dynamic access algorithm to
   multiple channels. Simulation results show that our approach is feasible

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the numerical error propagation and
   provide systematic backward stability analysis for some hierarchical
   rank structured matrix algorithms. We prove the backward stability of
   various important hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) methods, such as
   HSS matrix-vector multiplications, HSS ULV linear system solutions, HSS
   linear least squares solutions, HSS inversions, and some variations.
   Concrete backward error bounds are given, including a structured
   backward error for the solution in terms of the structured factors. The
   error propagation factors involve only low-degree powers of the maximum
   off-diagonal numerical rank and the logarithm of the matrix size. Thus,
   as compared with the corresponding standard dense matrix algorithms, the
   HSS algorithms not only are faster but also have much better stability.
   We also show that factorization-based HSS solutions are usually
   preferred, while inversion-based ones may suffer from numerical
   instability. The analysis builds a comprehensive framework for
   understanding the backward stability of hierarchical rank structured
   methods. The error propagation patterns also provide insights into the
   improvement of other types of structured solvers and the design of new
   stable hierarchical structured algorithms. Some numerical examples are
   included to support the studies.}},

Abstract = {{Multicast beamforming utilizes multiple transmit antennas and subscriber
   channel state information at the transmitter to direct power towards a
   group of subscribers while limiting interference caused to others.
   Unfortunately, the natural max-min-fair multicast beamforming
   formulation is a nonconvex Quadratically Constrained Quadratic
   Programming (QCQP) problem. This paper proposes a high performance, low
   complexity Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) algorithm for
   max-min-fair multicast beamforming with per antenna power constraints in
   a massive MIMO setting. The proposed approach is based on iterative
   approximation of the non-convex problem by a sequence of non-smooth,
   convex optimization problems, and using an inexact version of the
   Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for efficiently computing
   solutions of each SCA sub-problem via proximal operator evaluations.
   Simulations reveal that the algorithm achieves a very favorable
   performance-complexity trade-off relative to the existing

Abstract = {{In this paper, the impact of in-band full-duplex (IBFD) wireless
   communications on secret key generation via physical layer channel state
   information is investigated. A key generation strategy for IBFD wireless
   devices to increase the rate of generated secret keys over multipath
   fading channels is proposed. Conventionally, due to the half-duplex (HD)
   constraint on wireless transmissions, sensing simultaneous reciprocal
   channel measurements is not possible, which leads to a degraded key
   generation rate. However, with the advent of IBFD wireless devices, the
   legitimate nodes can sense the shared wireless link simultaneously at
   the possible cost of a self-interference (SI) channel estimation and
   some residual self-interference (RSI). As we demonstrate, with HD
   correlated observations the key rate is upper bounded by a constant,
   while with IBFD the key rate is only limited by the SI cancellation
   performance and is in general greater than that of its HD counterpart.
   Our analysis shows that with reasonable levels of SI cancellation, in
   the high SNR regime the key rate of IBFD is much higher, while in low
   SNRs, the HD system performs better. Finally, the key rate loss due to
   the overhead imposed by the SI channel estimation phase is discussed.}},

Title = {{Anomalous Localized Resonance Phenomena in the Nonmagnetic,
   Finite-Frequency Regime}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The phenomenon of anomalous localized resonance (ALR) is observed at the
   interface between materials with positive and negative material
   parameters and is characterized by the fact that when a given source is
   placed near the interface, the electric and magnetic fields start to
   have very fast and large oscillations around the interface as the
   absorption in the materials becomes very small while they remain smooth
   and regular away from the interface. In this paper, we discuss the
   phenomenon of anomalous localized resonance (ALR) in the context of an
   infinite slab of homogeneous, nonmagnetic material (mu = 1) with
   permittivity epsilon(s) = -1-i delta for some small loss delta << 1
   surrounded by positive, nonmagnetic, homogeneous media. We explicitly
   characterize the limit value of the product between frequency and the
   width of slab beyond which the ALR phenomenon does not occur and analyze
   the situation when the phenomenon is observed. In addition, we also
   construct sources for which the ALR phenomenon never appears.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel data fitting procedure of multi compartmentmodels
   of the brain white matter for diffusion MRI (dMRI) data. These
   biophysical models aim to characterize important micro-structure
   quantities like axonal radius, density and orientations. In order to
   describe the underlying tissue properties, a variety of models for
   intra-/extra-axonal diffusion signals have been proposed. Combinations
   of these analytic models are used to predict the diffusion MRI signal in
   multi-compartment settings. However, parameter estimation from these
   multi-compartment models is an ill-posed problem. Consequently, many
   existing fitting algorithms either rely on an initial grid search to
   find a good start point, or have strong assumptions like single fiber
   orientation to estimate some of these parameters from simpler models
   like the diffusion tensor (DT). In both cases, there is a tradeoff
   between computational complexity and accuracy of the estimated
   parameters. Here, we describe a novel algorithm based on the separation
   of the Nonlinear Least Squares (NLLS) fitting problem, via Variable
   Projection Method, to search for nonlinearly and linearly entering
   parameters independently. We use stochastic global search algorithms to
   find a global minimum, while estimating non-linearly entering
   parameters. The approach is independent of any starting point, and does
   not rely on estimates from simpler models. We show that the suggested
   algorithm is faster than algorithms involving grid search, and its
   greater accuracy and robustness are demonstrated on synthetic as well as
   ex-/in-vivo data.}},

Abstract = {{The selective removal of Cu2-x(S,Se) impurity phases from
   Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) (CZTSSe) and Cu(In,Ga)Se-2 (CIGS) thin films is a major
   barrier to achieving high efficiencies in solar cells based on these
   films. A toxic and hazardous potassium cyanide (KCN) solution is
   commonly used as a selective etchant to remove Cu2-x(S,Se) from CZTSSe
   and CIGS thin films. Herein, we report the selective removal of
   Cu2-x(S,Se) compounds from kesterite CZTSSe thin films using a mixture
   of ethylenediamine and 2-mercaptoethanol, a safer chemical mixture than
   KCN. We found that Cu2-xS and kesterite CZTS nanocrystals dissolve in
   this mixture in seconds and 6 hours, respectively, while wurtzite CZTS
   nanocrystals do not dissolve even after 6 hours. Etching CZTSSe thin
   films containing small amounts of Cu2-x(S,Se) phases for 20 minutes
   removes the Cu2-x(S,Se) phases completely.}},

Volume = {{6}},

Pages = {{98369-98380}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, the upgrading of anisole as a model compound for lignin
   derived bio-oils has been studied experimentally via a pin to plate
   pulsed corona discharge for the first time. The required hydrogen is
   generated in situ by plasma decomposition of methyl radicals which exist
   in bio oil chemical structure. In order to maximize the conversion and
   improving the selectivity of products, some operating parameters
   including pulsed repetition frequency, pin number, gap distance, plate
   electrode diameter and carrier gas flow rate have been evaluated.
   According to the results, the main products were BTX and phenol.
   Demethylation, transalkylation, hydrogenolysis, demethoxylation and
   methyl decomposition are the main chemical reactions. Results reveal
   that the selectivity of the desired products was enhanced through
   increasing the decomposition of generated methyl radicals which can be
   obtained by increasing the energy and number of collisions in the
   discharge zone. The maximum anisole conversion of 68\%, phenol
   selectivity of 45.6\% and BTX selectivity of 21.6\% were obtained. Due
   to the low temperature and atmospheric pressure conditions no
   hydrogenation of the aromatic ring was observed. The results indicated
   that the corona discharge plasma reactor can overcome the hydrogen
   challenges of the hydrodeoxygenation reaction.}},

Title = {{Effects of Interlayer Systems on Reflective Cracking in Unbonded
   Overlays of Existing Concrete Pavements}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2591}},
Pages = {{33-41}},
Abstract = {{Reflective cracking can be a concern in unbonded concrete overlays of
   existing distressed concrete pavements. In these structures, an inter
   layer, commonly hot-mix asphalt (HMA) or a nonwoven geotextile fabric,
   is placed to isolate the overlay concrete from the existing concrete
   pavement. The interlayer minimizes interaction between the overlay and
   the existing concrete pavement, which helps prevent distress in the
   existing pavement from propagating into the overlay. In this study, a
   laboratory investigation was used to examine the influence of HMA and
   geotextile fabric interlayer systems on the potential for development of
   reflective cracking. A laboratory test was conducted by using stacked
   beam specimens separated by an interlayer to evaluate the potential for
   a discrete crack in the lower beam reflecting up through the interlayer
   and into the overlay beam. The study revealed that reflective cracking
   was more likely when there was loss of support beneath the existing
   pavement. Reflective cracking did not occur with any of the interlayer
   systems when the beam was fully supported. The nonwoven geotextile inter
   layers that were tested were more effective than the HMA interlayers at
   preventing reflective cracking. Even though the fabric interlayer had a
   higher load ratio than the HMA interlayers, a relatively large load was
   required to generate reflective cracking regardless of the interlayer
   type (HMA or fabric) and, therefore, both may be suitable interlayer
   alternatives for the prevention of reflective cracking.}},

Abstract = {{Management of complex ecosystems is a difficult process that involves
   multiple factors and stakeholders. In most cases, the interactions of
   these factors and stakeholders' trade-offs are not considered
   quantitatively in the design and management of ecosystems. To address
   these issues mental modeling is useful for eliciting stakeholder
   objectives and preferences in order to evaluate preliminary knowledge
   about structure and function of complex ecosystems. This is advantageous
   for ecosystem analysis, modeling, and management.
   Here, we provide an assessment of stakeholder preferences and mental
   models for the case study of a large-scale watershed in Costa Rica
   composed by two rivers basins and one wetland. Trade-offs are related to
   water management in relation to ecological, agricultural, energy, and
   tourism endpoints that are affected by potential sets of dam and canal
   configurations. We apply and further develop a network-based model for
   stakeholder text analysis. Our innovation is the introduction of Network
   Complexity (NC) as a metric to characterize the inferred influenced
   diagram and to monitor the variation of such diagram under perturbations
   in socio-ecological factors provided by stakeholders and related to
   ecosystems. Perturbation effects-innovatively determined and assessed by
   global sensitivity and uncertainty analyses may reveal fundamental
   factor importance and interactions of ecosystem factors and ecosystem
   resilience. The derived influence diagram can be considered as the
   mental model of stakeholders because its construction is based on the
   direct elicitation of stakeholder preferences and objective in ad hoc
   workshops organized for this study.
   The decision analysis-based mental modeling approach allows a
   transparent and participatory decision-making concerning ecosystem
   management. The approach facilitates the identification and balance of
   trade-offs among stakeholder groups. Thus, it is coherent with the
   sustainability paradigm that includes social factors into the analysis,
   design, and management of complex systems.}},

Abstract = {{Numerical simulations were performed to document cooling of the lower
   surface of a channel. Through the channel top wall and normal to the
   channel flow are cooling jets that impinge on the channel lower surface.
   This surface has a regular array of dimples with centers in line with
   the impingement jet axes. Also on the channel lower surface is a series
   of purge holes through which coolant flow is extracted. The effects of
   location of the purge holes relative to the dimples and angle of the
   purge holes on the channel lower surface cooling performance are
   documented. A 3D RANS analysis with SST k-omega turbulence closure
   modeling was conducted with a Reynolds number of the impingement jet of
   35,000. The position of the purge hole relative to the dimple was varied
   from -0.34 to 0.50 dimple spacing, the purge hole angle varied as 30
   degrees and 150 degrees and three different ratios of bleed flow rate to
   impingement jet flow rate, 2.5\%, 5.0\% and 12.0\%, were documented. The
   results show how the combined effects of impingement jet flow, channel
   crossflow and purge flow affect heat transfer characteristics on the
   channel lower surface for this assembly. Also shown is how the dimpled
   surface heat transfer benefits from putting the purge flow holes
   slightly upstream in the channel flow from the dimples. The geometry
   under study may be applied for cooling a gas turbine endwall, where the
   bottom side of the channel lower wall of the assembly under study would
   be the passage endwall and the purge flow would be discrete hole film
   cooling flow.}},

Abstract = {{We estimate the wave speed in the acoustic wave equation from boundary
   measurements by constructing a reduced-order model (ROM) matching
   discrete time-domain data. The state-variable representation of the ROM
   can be equivalently viewed as a Galerkin projection onto the Krylov
   subspace spanned by the snapshots of the time-domain solution. The
   success of our algorithm hinges on the data-driven Gram Schmidt
   orthogonalization of the snapshots that suppresses multiple reflections
   and can be viewed as a discrete form of the Marchenko Gel'fand Levitan
   Krein algorithm. In particular, the orthogonalized snapshots are
   localized functions, the (squared) norms of which are essentially
   weighted averages of the wave speed. The centers of mass of the squared
   orthogonalized snapshots provide us with the grid on which we
   reconstruct the velocity. This grid is weakly dependent on the wave
   speed in traveltime coordinates, so the grid points may be approximated
   by the centers of mass of the analogous set of squared orthogonalized
   snapshots generated by a known reference velocity. We present results of
   inversion experiments for one-and two-dimensional synthetic models.}},

Abstract = {{Polynomial filtering can provide a highly effective means of computing
   all eigenvalues of a real symmetric (or complex Hermitian) matrix that
   are located in a given interval, anywhere in the spectrum. This paper
   describes a technique for tackling this problem by combining a thick
   restart version of the Lanczos algorithm with deflation
   ({''}locking{''}) and a new type of polynomial filter obtained from a
   least-squares technique. The resulting algorithm can be utilized in a
   ``spectrum slicing{''} approach whereby a very large number of
   eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of the matrix are computed by
   extracting eigenpairs located in different subintervals independently

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{45-51}},
Abstract = {{This paper documents the development and evaluation of a low-cost,
   vehicle-mounted sensor suite and processing algorithms capable of
   automatically detecting and determining the position of lane markings
   accurate to the 10-cm (4-in.) level. Such map data can be used for many
   applications, including lane departure avoidance systems based on the
   global navigation satellite system (GNSS) or GPS, road curvature
   calculations, automated systems for reapplying lane markings, and
   high-accuracy road mapping including improving the local base map. The
   sensor suite used consists of a high-accuracy GNSS receiver, a
   side-facing video camera, a computer, and mounting hardware. The
   side-facing camera is used to record video of the ground adjacent to the
   passenger side of the vehicle. The video is processed with a computer
   vision algorithm that locates the fog line within the video frame.
   Vehicle position data (provided by GNSS) and previously collected
   calibration data are used to locate the fog line in real-world
   coordinates. The system was tested on two roads (primarily two-lane,
   undivided highway) for which high-accuracy (<10 cm) maps were available.
   The offset between the reference data and the computed fog line position
   was generally better than 7.5 cm (3 in.). The results of this work
   demonstrate that it is feasible to use a GNSS combined with a camera to
   detect the position of a road's fog lines for the development of
   high-accuracy maps that are useful for many applications.}},

   PATTERNS FOR HELICAL STRUCTURES}},
Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON APPLIED MATHEMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{76}},

Abstract = {{Conventional X-ray methods use incoming plane waves which result in
   discrete diffraction patterns when scattered at crystals. Here we find,
   by a systematic method, incoming waveforms which exhibit discrete
   diffraction patterns when scattered at helical structures. As examples
   we present simulated diffraction patterns of carbon nanotubes and
   tobacco mosaic virus. The new incoming waveforms, which we call twisted
   waves due to their geometric shape, are found theoretically as
   closed-form solutions to Maxwell's equations. The theory of the ensuing
   diffraction patterns is developed in detail. A twisted analogue of the
   Von Laue condition is seen to hold, with the peak locations encoding the
   symmetry and the helix parameters, and the peak intensities indicating
   the electronic structure in the unit cell. If suitable twisted X-ray
   sources can in the future be realized experimentally, it appears from
   our mathematical results that they will provide a powerful tool for
   directly determining the detailed atomic structure of numerous
   biomolecules and nanostructures with helical symmetries. This would
   eliminate the need to crystallize those structures or their subunits.}},

Abstract = {{A correlation between the performance of electrochemiluminescent (ECL)
   displays and properties of ECL gels consisting of
   1-alkyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide
   ({[}AMI]{[}TFSI], ionic liquid), poly(vinylidene

   2,2'-bipyridyl-bis{[}2-(2',4'-difluorophenyl)pyridine]iridium
   hexafluorophosphate (Ir(diFppy)(2)(bpy)PF6, ECL luminophore) is
   investigated. Since a majority of the conductive channel in the gel is
   an ionic liquid (IL), the physical properties of the gel depend strongly
   on those of the IL. Here we vary the length of the alkyl chain on the
   1-position of the cation {[}AMI] with fixed anion {[}TFSI], so that the
   physical properties of the gel are systematically tuned. As the alkyl
   length of {[}AMI] increases, a higher operating voltage is required due
   to a lower conductivity of the gel (i.e., larger voltage drop). In
   addition, the device response time is also intimately connected to the
   gel. The {[}AMI]{[}TFSI] having longer alkyl chains induces a slower
   response of the device, which is attributable to impeded ion diffusion
   due to higher viscosity.}},

Title = {{Kinetic partitioning during de novo septin filament assembly creates a
   critical G1 ``window of opportunity{''} for mutant septin function}},
Journal = {{CELL CYCLE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{15}},
Number = {{18}},
Pages = {{2441-2453}},
Abstract = {{Septin proteins form highly conserved cytoskeletal filaments composed of
   hetero-oligomers with strict subunit stoichiometry. Mutations within one
   hetero-oligomerization interface (the G interface) bias the mutant
   septin toward conformations that are incompatible with filament
   assembly, causing disease in humans and, in budding yeast cells,
   temperature-sensitive defects in cytokinesis. We previously found that,
   when the amount of other hetero-oligomerization partners is limiting,
   wild-type and G interface-mutant alleles of a given yeast septin compete
   along parallel but distinct folding pathways for occupancy of a limited
   number of positions within septin hetero-octamers. Here, we synthesize a
   mathematical model that outlines the requirements for this phenomenon:
   if a wild-type septin traverses a folding pathway that includes a single
   rate-limiting folding step, the acquisition by a mutant septin of
   additional slow folding steps creates an initially large disparity
   between wild-type and mutant in the cellular concentrations of
   oligomerization-competent monomers. When the 2 alleles are co-expressed,
   this kinetic disparity results in mutant exclusion from
   hetero-oligomers, even when the folded mutant monomer is
   oligomerization-competent. To test this model experimentally, we first
   visualize the kinetic delay in mutant oligomerization in living cells,
   and then narrow or widen the window of opportunity for mutant septin
   oligomerization by altering the length of the G1 phase of the yeast cell
   cycle, and observe the predicted exacerbation or suppression,
   respectively, of mutant cellular phenotypes. These findings reveal a
   fundamental kinetic principle governing in vivo assembly of multiprotein
   complexes, independent of the ability of the subunits to associate with
   each other.}},

   electrospun microfibers. Under anaerobic conditions the
   poly(vinylalcohol) and electrospun composite membranes produced an
   average of 44.6 +/- 11.3 mL H-2 g(-1) hexose ( 0.33 +/- 0.08 mol H-2
   mol(-1) hexose) and 21.2 +/- 4.8 mL H-2 g(-1) hexose ( 0.16 +/- 0.04 mol
   H-2 mol(-1) hexose), respectively, and captured 73 +/- 12\% and 57 +/-
   11\%, respectively, of the total H-2 produced in bioreactors fed
   synthetic high strength wastewater. The H-2 capture efficiency of the
   electrospun composite membrane was improved by coating the modules with
   a thin film of polymeric silica gel, improving the H-2 production to
   28.3 +/- 2.3 mL H-2 per hexose ( 0.21 +/- 0.02 mol H-2 mol(-1) hexose)
   and the H-2 capture efficiency to 73 +/- 15\%. Final composite membranes
   were built by immobilizing bacteria directly onto the membrane surface,
   again improving H-2 yields from high strength synthetic wastewater to a
   maximum of 48.4 +/- 9.4 mL H-2 g(-1) hexose ( 0.36 +/- 0.07 mol H-2
   mol(-1) hexose) with a maximum H-2 capture efficiency of 86 +/- 9\%. The
   optimized composite membranes were also capable of generating and
   capturing H-2 from real wastewaters, with yields and capture
   efficiencies of 19.2 +/- 3.0 mL H-2 g(-1) hexose ( 0.14 +/- 0.02 mol H-2
   mol(-1) hexose) and 99.1 +/- 0.2\%, and 46.0 +/- 15.5 mL H-2 g(-1)
   hexose ( 0.34 +/- 0.12 mol H-2 mol(-1) hexose) and 79 +/- 19\% when
   tested with a feed of sugar beet wastewater and dairy production
   wastewater, respectively. After further optimization, the composite
   membrane system could allow the extraction of high-quality energy from
   wastewater.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops an enumeration algorithm for the no-wait flow shop
   scheduling problem with due date constraints. In this problem, waiting
   time is not allowed between successive operations of jobs. Plus, each
   job is accompanied by a due date which is dealt with as a hard
   constraint The considered performance criterion is makespan. The problem
   is strongly NP-hard. In this research, a new modelling approach is
   developed for the problem. This new modelling technique and the
   resulting observations are incorporated into a new exact algorithm to
   solve the problem to optimality. To investigate the performance of the
   algorithm, a number of test problems arc solved and the results are
   reported. Computational results demonstrate that the developed algorithm
   is significantly faster than the mathematical models. (C) 2016, IFAC

Title = {{Effects of Cyclic Temperature on the Time-Dependent Behavior of
   Posttensioned Concrete Bridges}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{142}},
Number = {{10}},
Abstract = {{Typically, measurement and analysis of concrete time-dependent behaviors
   such as creep and shrinkage are performed under the assumption of
   constant temperature conditions. However, many structures in the field
   are subject to variable seasonal and daily temperatures. This paper
   explores how changes in temperature affect the time-dependent behavior
   of concrete structures, with a particular focus on posttensioned
   concrete bridges. Temperature-dependent creep, shrinkage, aging, and
   relaxation models were incorporated into structural finite-element
   analyses examining a posttensioned concrete beam under variable thermal
   loading. The impacts of uniform temperature changes on the
   time-dependent deflections, strains, and stresses were accounted for
   using an Arrhenius-adjusted age based on the structure temperature.
   However, nonuniform temperature changes, such as thermal gradients
   through the depth of the cross-section, caused time-dependent behavior
   that could not be accounted for using the Arrhenius-adjusted age based
   on the average structure temperature. Time-dependent vertical
   deflections and especially longitudinal stresses throughout the
   structure were altered by the repeated application of thermal gradients.
   The different creep and shrinkage strain rates through the depth of the
   section, driven by the temperature and stress differences from the
   applied thermal gradients, induced residual stresses. The presence of
   these residual stresses implies that time-dependent stress changes from
   a creep and shrinkage analysis at a constant temperature cannot be
   linearly superimposed with the stresses caused by thermal gradients
   computed using an independent elastic analysis.}},

Title = {{Stretching liquid bridges with moving contact lines: comparison of
   liquid-transfer predictions and experiments}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{36}},
Pages = {{7457-7469}},
Abstract = {{Transfer of liquid from one surface to another plays a key role in
   printing processes. During liquid transfer, a liquid bridge is formed
   and then undergoes significant extensional motion while its contact
   lines are free to move on the bounding solid surfaces. In this work, we
   develop one-dimensional (1D) slender-jet and two-dimensional (2D)
   axisymmetric models of this phenomenon and compare the resulting
   predictions with previously published experimental data. For very low
   capillary numbers (Ca) (quasi-static stretching), predictions from both
   models of the amount of liquid transferred agree well with the
   experimental data, provided that the difference in receding contact
   angles (vertical bar Delta theta(r)vertical bar) between the two
   surfaces is sufficiently large. Notably, the amount of liquid
   transferred is primarily governed by the overall bridge shape and is not
   significantly influenced by contact-line motion toward the end of bridge
   stretching. For O(1) values of Ca, the models predict that each surface
   receives half the liquid, in agreement with experimental observations.
   For intermediate values of Ca (and very low values of Ca when vertical
   bar Delta theta(r)vertical bar is small enough), predictions from each
   model can deviate substantially from the experimental data, which we
   speculate is due to the influence of surface heterogeneities that are
   not included in the models. In this regime, there can be significant
   differences between the predictions of the 1D and 2D models, which is
   due to the tendency of the contact line to slip more in the 1D model.
   The models are also used to understand the influence of initial bridge
   shape on liquid transfer and to rationalize related experimental
   observations. The results from these fundamental studies will aid the
   optimization of gravure and other printing processes for manufacturing
   of printed electronic devices.}},

Abstract = {{An arsenite (As (III)) selective membrane of ionophore is deposited on a
   micro gold electrode surface to determine trace As (III) using anodic
   stripping voltammetry (ASV). Compared with a sensor without an ionophore
   membrane ({''}bare sensor{''}), the selective sensor's performance is
   greatly improved due to the membrane's superior As (III)
   permselectivity. The selective sensor's background current amplitude
   decreased from 1.375 mu A to 0.320 mu A, and its standard deviation
   decreased from 0.150 mu A to 0.007 mu A, leading to a higher
   signal-to-noise ratio (SIN). Meanwhile, the sensor's peak current
   standard deviation also dropped from 0.218 mu A to 0.015 mu A. Thus, low
   limit of detection (LOD) of 1.09 ppb is obtained for determining trace
   As (III). This simple, but highly sensitive selective sensor may lead to
   wide applications to on-line environmental monitoring.}},

Abstract = {{Thermosensitive stealth liposomes were created by mixing lipids and
   PEGylated lipids with single-tail peptide-amphiphiles. We demonstrated
   for the first time that the peptide-amphiphiles provided
   receptor-specific binding and cell internalization while inducing the
   thermosensitive properties of the liposomes. The formulations were
   stable at 37 degrees C in the presence of serum, with faster release of
   their encapsulated load at 41 degrees C compared to stealth liposomes
   without the peptide-amphiphiles or commercially available
   thermosensitive stealth liposomes. The thermosensitive properties of our
   formulation were also examined in vivo. Preliminary work showed
   increased release of the encapsulated calcein after heating the liver of
   a mouse with a dual-mode ultrasound array system for 20 s to 41-43
   degrees C, 4 h after receiving tail vein injections of the liposomes,
   compared to a mouse that received the liposomal injections but no
   heating. The receptor-targeting ability of the peptide-functionalized
   liposomes was examined in vitro with MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Our
   liposomes outperformed the other formulations as they showed specific
   binding, receptor-mediated endocytosis, and increased intracellular
   temperature-triggered release of encapsulated calcein.}},

   We show fruitful insights about language usage on Twitter which can be
   exploited in language based applications on top of tweets, e.g., lingual

Abstract = {{Molecularly-targeted microbubbles (MBs) are increasingly being
   recognized as promising contrast agents for oncological molecular
   imaging with ultrasound. With the detection and validation of new
   molecular imaging targets, novel binding ligands are needed that bind to
   molecular imaging targets with high affinity and specificity. In this
   study we assessed a novel class of potentially clinically translatable
   MBs using an engineered 10th type III domain of human-fibronectin
   (MB-FN3(VEGFR2)) scaffold-ligand to image VEGFR2 on the neovasculature
   of cancer. The in vitro binding of MB-FN3(VEGFR2) to a soluble VEGFR2
   was assessed by flow-cytometry (FACS) and binding to VEGFR2-expressing
   cells was assessed by flow-chamber cell attachment studies under flow
   shear stress conditions. In vivo binding of MB-FN3(VEGFR2) was tested in
   a transgenic mouse model (FVB/N Tg(MMTV/PyMT634Mul) of breast cancer and
   control litter mates with normal mammary glands. In vitro FACS and
   flow-chamber cell attachment studies showed significantly (P< 0.01)
   higher binding to VEGFR2 using MB-FN3(VEGFR2) than control agents. In
   vivo ultrasound molecular imaging (USMI) studies using MB-FN3(VEGFR2)
   demonstrated specific binding to VEGFR2 and was significantly higher (P<
   0.01) in breast cancer compared to normal breast tissue. Ex vivo
   immunofluorescence-analysis showed significantly (P< 0.01) increased
   VEGFR2-expression in breast cancer compared to normal mammary tissue.
   Our results suggest that MBs coupled to FN3-scaffolds can be designed
   and used for USMI of breast cancer neoangiogenesis. Due to their small
   size, stability, solubility, the lack of glycosylation and disulfide
   bonds, FN3-scaffolds can be recombinantly produced with the advantage of
   generating small, high affinity ligands in a cost efficient way for
   USMI.}},

Title = {{Effect of Early Opening to Traffic on Fatigue Damage to Concrete
   Pavement}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2016}},
Number = {{2590}},
Pages = {{94-103}},
Abstract = {{The current methods for determining criteria for opening a roadway to
   traffic are often overly conservative, causing unnecessary construction
   delays and user costs. This problem can be explained, in part, by the
   purely empirical nature of the current methods. These criteria require
   wait periods after concrete placement or certain levels of compressive
   or flexural strength, or both, after concrete placement, and specific
   site conditions are not accounted for. Further, the effect of early
   traffic-related loads on long-term pavement behavior has not been
   quantified. In this study, the effect of early opening on pavement
   damage was reexamined through a laboratory study and analytical
   modeling. The result was a mechanistic-based procedure for evaluating
   the effect of early opening to traffic on the accumulation longterm
   damage; this procedure also accounts for critical factors such as
   climate, traffic level, and pavement design characteristics. The basis
   of this method is a modification of the fatigue damage analysis in the
   Mechanistic Empirical Pavement Design Guide; this modification enables
   an analysis of traffic loading on the first 28 days of pavement life.
   The procedure also enables an update to predictions on the basis of
   as-built nondestructive testing measurements of the pavement. The output
   of the analysis is a quantitative damage prediction that allows the road
   owner to do a cost benefit analysis of the timing for opening the road
   on the basis of the specific site and traffic characteristics. The
   results presented here show how innovated opening criteria based on load
   restrictions can allow for early opening while mitigating any adverse
   effect on the long-term pavement performance.}},

Title = {{Multiple new-particle growth pathways observed at the US DOE Southern
   Great Plains field site}},
Journal = {{ATMOSPHERIC CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{14}},
Pages = {{9321-9348}},
Abstract = {{New-particle formation (NPF) is a significant source of aerosol
   particles into the atmosphere. However, these particles are initially
   too small to have climatic importance and must grow, primarily through
   net uptake of lowvolatility species, from diameters similar to 1 to
   30-100 nm in order to potentially impact climate. There are currently
   uncertainties in the physical and chemical processes associated with the
   growth of these freshly formed particles that lead to uncertainties in
   aerosol-climate modeling. Four main pathways for new-particle growth
   have been identified: condensation of sulfuric-acid vapor (and
   associated bases when available), condensation of organic vapors, uptake
   of organic acids through acid-base chemistry in the particle phase, and
   accretion of organic molecules in the particle phase to create a
   lower-volatility compound that then contributes to the aerosol mass. The
   relative importance of each pathway is uncertain and is the focus of
   this work.
   The 2013 New Particle Formation Study (NPFS) measurement campaign took
   place at the DOE Southern Great Plains (SGP) facility in Lamont,
   Oklahoma, during spring 2013. Measured gas-and particle-phase
   compositions during these new-particle growth events suggest three
   distinct growth pathways: (1) growth by primarily organics, (2) growth
   by primarily sulfuric acid and ammonia, and (3) growth by primarily
   sulfuric acid and associated bases and organics. To supplement the
   measurements, we used the particle growth model MABNAG (Model for
   Acid-Base chemistry in NAnoparticle Growth) to gain further insight into
   the growth processes on these 3 days at SGP. MABNAG simulates growth
   from (1) sulfuric-acid condensation (and subsequent salt formation with
   ammonia or amines), (2) nearirreversible condensation from nonreactive
   extremely lowvolatility organic compounds (ELVOCs), and (3) organicacid
   condensation and subsequent salt formation with ammonia or amines.
   MABNAG is able to corroborate the observed differing growth pathways,
   while also predicting that ELVOCs contribute more to growth than organic
   salt formation. However, most MABNAG model simulations tend to
   underpredict the observed growth rates between 10 and 20 nm in diameter;
   this underprediction may come from neglecting the contributions to
   growth from semi-to-lowvolatility species or accretion reactions. Our
   results suggest that in addition to sulfuric acid, ELVOCs are also very
   important for growth in this rural setting. We discuss the limitations
   of our study that arise from not accounting for semiand low-volatility
   organics, as well as nitrogen-containing species beyond ammonia and
   amines in the model. Quantitatively understanding the overall budget,
   evolution, and thermodynamic properties of lower-volatility organics in
   the atmosphere will be essential for improving global aerosol models.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of the mechanical behavior of soft tissues is challenging

   present a method for the computational dissection' of a tissue, by which
   we mean the use of computational tools both to identify and to analyze
   regions within a tissue sample that have different mechanical
   properties. The approach employs an inverse technique applied to a
   series of planar biaxial experimental protocols. The aggregated data
   from multiple protocols provide the basis for (1) segmentation of the
   tissue into regions of similar properties, (2) linear analysis for the
   small-strain behavior, assuming uniform, linear, anisotropic behavior
   within each region, (3) subsequent nonlinear analysis following each
   individual experimental protocol path and using local linear properties,
   and (4) construction of a strain energy data set W(E) at every point in
   the material by integrating the differential stress-strain functions
   along each strain path. The approach has been applied to simulated data
   and captures not only the general nonlinear behavior but also the
   regional differences introduced into the simulated tissue sample.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a novel approach to estimate delay differences of
   each stage in a standard MUX-based physical unclonable function (PUF).
   Test data collected from PUFs fabricated using 32 nm process are used to
   train a linear model. The delay differences of the stages directly
   correspond to the model parameters. These parameters are trained by
   using a least mean square (LMS) adaptive algorithm. The accuracy of the
   response using the proposed model is around 97.5\% and 99.5\% for two
   different PUFs. Second, the PUF is also modeled by a perceptron. The
   perceptron has almost 100\% classification accuracy. A comparison shows
   that the perceptron model parameters are scaled versions of the model
   derived by the LMS algorithm. Thus, the delay differences can be
   estimated from the perceptron model where the scaling factor is computed
   by comparing the models of the LMS algorithm and the perceptron. Because
   the delay differences are challenge independent, these parameters can be
   stored on the server. This will enable the server to issue random
   challenges whose responses need not be stored. An analysis of the
   proposed model confirms that the delay differences of all stages of the
   PUFs on the same chip belong to the same Gaussian probability density
   function.}},

Abstract = {{Proper quality control and quality improvement strategies during

   premature failures of asphalt pavements. This paper discusses the use of
   the Intelligent Compaction Analyzer (ICA), which was developed at the
   University of Oklahoma, in quality control and quality improvement
   during compaction of stabilized subgrade. Six case studies were
   conducted to demonstrate the ability of the ICA in monitoring subgrade
   density and subgrade modulus (known as ICA modulus) in real time. The
   ICA modulus correlated reasonably with the subgrade modulus

Abstract = {{Searching microblogs, e.g., tweets and comments, is practically
   supported through main-memory indexing for scalable data digestion and
   efficient query evaluation. With continuity and excessive numbers of
   microblogs, it is infeasible to keep data in main-memory for long
   periods. Thus, once allocated memory budget is filled, a portion of data
   is flushed from memory to disk to continuously accommodate newly
   incoming data. Existing techniques come with either low memory hit ratio
   due to flushing items regardless of their relevance to incoming queries
   or significant overhead of tracking individual data items, which limit
   scalability of microblogs systems in either cases. In this paper, we
   propose kFlushing policy that exploits popularity of top-k queries in
   microblogs to smartly select a subset of microblogs to flush. kFlushing
   is mainly designed to increase memory hit ratio. To this end, it
   identifies and flushes in-memory data that does not contribute to
   incoming queries. The freed memory space is utilized to accumulate more
   useful data that is used to answer more queries from memory contents.
   When all memory is utilized for useful data, kFlushing flushes data that
   is less likely to degrade memory hit ratio. In addition, kFlushing comes
   with a little overhead that keeps high system scalability in terms of
   high digestion rates of incoming fast data. Extensive experimental
   evaluation shows the effectiveness and scalability of kFlushing to
   improve main-memory hit by 26-330\% while coping up with fast microblog
   streams of up to 100K microblog/second.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces Hadoop Viz; a Map Reduce-based framework for
   visualizing big spatial data. Hadoop Viz has three unique features that
   distinguish it from other techniques. (1) It exposes an extensible
   interface which allows users to define a new visualization types, e.g.,
   scatter plot, road network, or heat map, by defining five abstract
   functions, without delving into the implementation details of the Map
   Reduce algorithms. As it is open source, Hadoop Viz allows algorithm
   designers to focus on how the data should be visualized rather than
   performance or scalability issues. (2) Hadoop Viz is capable of
   generating big images with giga-pixel resolution by employing a
   three-phase technique, partition-plot-merge. (3) HadoopViz provides a
   smoothing functionality which can fuse nearby records together as the
   image is plotted. This makes it capable of generating more types of
   images with high quality as compared to existing work. Experimental
   results on real datasets of up to 14 Billion points show the
   extensibility, scalability, and efficiency of Hadoop Viz to handle
   different visualization types of spatial big data.}},

Abstract = {{The recent wide popularity of microblogs (e.g., tweets, online comments)
   has empowered various important applications, including, news delivery,
   event detection, market analysis, and target advertising. A core module
   in all these applications is a frequent/trending query processor that
   aims to find out those topics that are highly frequent or trending in
   the social media through posted microblogs. Unfortunately current
   attempts for such core module suffer from several drawbacks. Most
   importantly, their narrow scope, as they focus only on solving trending
   queries for a very special case of localized and very recent microblogs.
   This paper presents GARNET; a holistic system equipped with one-stop
   efficient and scalable solution for supporting a generic form of
   context-aware frequent and trending queries on microblogs. GARNET
   supports both frequent and trending queries, any arbitrary time interval
   either current, recent, or past, of fixed granularity, and having a set
   of arbitrary filters over contextual attributes. From a system point of
   view, GARNET is very appealing and industry-friendly, as one needs to
   realize it once in the system. Then, a myriad of various forms of
   trending and frequent queries are immediately supported. Experimental
   evidence based on a real system prototype of GARNET and billions of real
   Twitter data show the scalability and efficiency of GARNET for various
   query types.}},

Abstract = {{In cold climate regions, thermal cracking of asphalt pavements is a
   major pavement distress. Cold climates cause a thermal contraction
   within the pavement. When combined with the brittle behaviour of asphalt
   at low temperatures, the thermally induced stresses are relieved by
   transverse cracks forming in the pavement. This cracking facilitates
   poor ride quality and premature failure of the pavement. There is
   currently no asphalt mixture performance test required by majority of
   Department of Transportations (DOTs) in the United States to address the
   issue of thermal cracking. Previous research has indicated that fracture
   energy of asphalt mixtures is a reliable predictor of transverse
   cracking performance. This mechanistic property of asphalt mixtures can
   be found using the disk-shaped compact tension (DCT) test. On basis of
   previous research, a low-temperature cracking performance specification
   that uses DCT fracture energy has been developed. During 2013
   construction season, five construction projects were chosen to implement
   provisional specifications that use fracture energy as a required mix
   parameter. The projects encompassed different construction techniques,
   material compositions and climatic zones. The implementation procedure
   as well as the results from testing is presented in this paper. The
   results indicate a shift in the DCT fracture energy values between
   laboratory produced specimens that were provided as part of mix design
   acceptance and those manufactured using plant produced mix. Other
   findings include reaffirmation of common knowledge that use of higher
   binder contents and/or improved low temperature binder grades provide
   mixtures with improved fracture energies.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to describe how a generalized
   single-system-single-solve (GS4-1) computational framework, previously

   to time dependent Burgers' equation, which is well-known to serve as a
   simplified model of fluid dynamics, for illustrations of the essential
   concepts.
   Design/methodology/approach - The framework permits, for a very general
   family of time integrators where traditional methods are a subset, much
   needed desirable features including second order time accuracy,
   robustness and unconditional stability, zero-order overshoot behavior,
   and additionally, a selective control of high frequency damping for both
   the primary variable and its time derivative. The latter, which is a
   new, key desirable feature not available in past/existing methods
   to-date, allows for different amounts of high frequency damping for both
   the primary variable and its time derivative to ensure physically
   accurate solutions of these variables. This is in contrast to having
   only limited control of these numerical dampings, often
   indiscriminately, as in some past developments which can lead to
   numerical instabilities in the time derivative variable. The extension
   of the framework to nonlinear problems, as described in this paper, is
   achieved via the use of a normalized time weighted residual approach,
   which naturally allows the time discretization of the transient
   nonlinear systems as being the natural extensions of the linear systems.
   Findings - The primary aim is also to demonstrate the advantage of the
   selective control feature inherit in the present numerical methodologies
   for these nonlinear first order transient systems as in the linear
   counterparts.
   Originality/value - The authors wish to tackle the challenges to further
   enable extensions to nonlinear first order transient systems that
   frequently arise in fluid dynamics problems; this is the focus of this
   paper. The primary wish is to demonstrate the ability of the GS4-1
   framework for nonlinear first order transient systems as seen in the
   linear transient counterparts; while on one hand the authors show that
   an equal amount of high frequency damping (i.e. rho(infinity) =
   rho(s)(infinity)) leads to non-physical instability in the time
   derivative variable for a minimal damping required to obtain acceptable
   solution of the primary variable, on the other hand, the authors
   particularly demonstrate how this instability can be easily tuned off
   via the selective control feature (i.e. rho(infinity) not equal
   rho(s)(infinity) ) offered by the developed framework; thereby,
   demonstrating its robustness and superiority.}},

Title = {{Guanidinylated cationic nanoparticles as robust protein antigen delivery

   vivo}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY B}},

Abstract = {{Weak immunogenicity and transient humoral or cellular immune responses
   are the major limitations of modern protein vaccines. Using delivery
   adjuvants is a good strategy to promote their immune response in vivo.
   In this study, a type of guanidinylated and cationic nanoparticle
   adjuvant self-assembled by monomethoxy poly(ethylene
   glycol)-block-poly(2-(diisopropyl amino) ethyl methacrylate)-block-poly(
   2-(guanidyl) ethyl methacrylate) (mPEG-b-PDPA-b-PGEM, PEDG) copolymers
   was used as an antigen delivery carrier. PEDG nanoparticles could
   encapsulate the model antigen ovalbumin (OVA) by facile electrostatic
   absorption with a loading efficiency of approximately 200 mu g of OVA
   per 1 mg of the polymer. Rapid OVA release within 4 hours in acidic
   lysosomal compartments of antigen-presenting cells was observed. PEDG
   nanoparticles could stimulate the maturation of mouse bone
   marrow-derived dendritic cells and enhance antigen uptake and
   presentation by 4 fold compared to free OVA. The nanoparticles also
   induced the activation of macrophages (RAW 264.7) to produce a high
   level of cytokines including TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-10. OVA-loaded PEDG
   nanoparticles efficiently induced a superior antigen cross-presentation
   effect in vitro and in vivo compared to free OVA vaccination. In vivo
   stimulation of mice using nanoparticle-formulated OVA robustly enhanced
   the antigen-specific CD8(+) T cell proliferation and the secretion of
   antigen-specific IgG, serum IgG2a/IgG1 antibodies and cytokines
   (IFN-gamma, IL-2). The strategy of nanoparticle delivery prolonged the
   antigen duration at the injection site and enhanced its migration to
   draining lymph nodes as indicated by fluorescence tracking. In all, the
   novel guanidinylated nanoparticles could act as an effective adjuvant
   delivery system for protein antigens to elicit both potent
   antigen-specific cellular immune responses, including Th1-based adaptive
   immunity and CD8(+) T cell response, and humoral immune responses.}},

Abstract = {{Liquid hot water (LHW) pretreatment is an effective method to improve
   enzymatic digestibility of lignocellulosic feedstock by removing
   hemicellulose/lignin. To better understand how LHW pretreatment reduces
   plant cell wall recalcitrance, we applied a combined approach using
   multiple microscopic techniques and chemometric methods to monitor
   microstructural and topochemical changes in the fiber cell wall of sugar
   maple (Acer saccharum). The heterogeneity of deconstruction in various
   cell wall layers was easily visualized based on chemical
   characterizations through confocal Raman microscopy, combining with
   principal component analysis and cluster analysis. Interestingly, after
   LHW pretreatment, the S2 layer was differentiated into two regions,
   namely a heavy-damaged region (outer and thin inner S2) with more
   polysaccharides removed, and a light-damaged region (middle S2) which
   still remained relatively intact. Our results have established a direct
   correlation between microstructural and topochemical changes of a cell
   wall following LHW pretreatment. The removal of polysaccharides (mainly
   hemicelluloses) rather than lignin played a critical role in the visible
   damage of the cell wall, like cavities, gaps and collapses.}},

Abstract = {{Open innovation often enjoys large quantities of submitted content. Yet
   the need to effectively process such large quantities of content impede
   the widespread use of open innovation in practice. This article presents
   an exploration of needs-based open innovation using state-of-the art
   natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to address existing
   limitations of exploiting large amounts of incoming data. The Semantic
   Textual Similarity (STS) algorithms were specifically developed to
   compare sentence-length text passages and were used to rate the semantic
   similarity of pairs of text sentences submitted by users of a custom
   open innovation platform. A total of 341 unique users submitted 1,735
   textual problem statements or unmet needs relating to multiple topics:
   cooking, cleaning, and travel. Scores of equivalence generated by a
   consensus of ten human evaluators for a subset of the needs provided a
   benchmark for similarity comparison. The semantic analysis allowed for
   rapid (1 day per topic), automated screening of redundancy to facilitate
   identification of quality submissions. In addition, a series of
   permutation analyses provided critical crowd characteristics for the
   rates of redundant entries as crowd size increases. The results identify
   top modern STS algorithms for needfinding. These predicted similarity
   with Pearson correlations of up to .85 when trained using need-based
   training data and up to .83 when trained using generalized data. Rates
   of duplication varied with crowd size and may be approximately linear or
   appear asymptotic depending on the degree of similarity used as a
   cutoff. Semantic algorithm performance has shown rapid improvements in
   recent years. Potential applications to screen duplicates and also to
   screen highly unique sentences for rapid exploration of a space are
   discussed.}},

Abstract = {{The adsorption and reaction properties of H-BEA, SnBEA, ZrBEA and
   siliceous BEA were examined to understand the reaction of
   2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) with ethylene to form p-xylene.
   Temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of diethyl ether, DMF,
   2,5-hexanedione and p-xylene on each of the zeo-lites demonstrated that
   the Bronsted sites in H-BEA are more reactive than the Lewis sites in
   SnBEA and ZrBEA and tend to promote the oligomerization of DMF and
   2,5-hexanedione, even at 295 K; however, the adsorbed 2,5-hexanedione is
   converted to DMF at both Lewis-and Bronsted-acid sites. H-BEA, SnBEA and
   ZrBEA all catalyzed the reaction to p-xylene with high selectivity in a
   continuous-flow reactor, with all three catalysts showing rates that
   were first order in both DMF and ethylene. H-BEA was found to deactivate
   rapidly due to coking, while ZrBEA and SnBEA were both stable. The
   implications of these results for practical applications are discussed.}},

Volume = {{26}},

Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present new implementation
   aspects of unified explicit time integration algorithms, called the
   explicit GS4-II family of algorithms, of a second-order time accuracy in
   all the unknowns (e.g. positions, velocities, and accelerations) with
   particular attention to the moving-particle simulation (MPS) method for
   solving the incompressible fluids with free surfaces.
   Design/methodology/approach - In the present paper, the explicit GS4-II
   family of algorithms is implemented in the MPS method in the following
   two different approaches: a direct explicit formulation with the use of
   the weak incompressibility equation involving the (modified) speed of
   sound; and a predictor-corrector explicit formulation. The first
   approach basically follows the concept of the explicit MPS method,
   presented in the literature, and the latter approach employs a similar
   concept used in, for example, a fractional-step method in computational
   fluid dynamics.
   Findings - Illustrative numerical examples demonstrate that any scheme
   within the proposed algorithmic framework captures the physics with the
   necessary second-order time accuracy and stability.
   Originality/value - The new algorithmic framework extended with the
   GS4-II family encompasses a multitude of pastand new schemes and offers
   a general purpose and unified implementation.}},

Title = {{An overview of phonon-based heat conduction models and their solution}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NUMERICAL METHODS FOR HEAT \& FLUID FLOW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{3-4}},
Pages = {{916-949}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview and some
   recent advances in the models, analysis and simulation of thermal
   transport of phonons as related to the field of microscale/macroscale
   heat conduction in solids. The efforts focus upon a fairly comprehensive
   overview of the subject matter from a unified standpoint highlighting
   the various approximations inherent in the thermal models. Subsequently,
   the numerical formulations and illustrations using the current
   state-of-the-art are provided.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is dedicated to the approximate
   solution to the relaxation time phonon Boltzmann equation (BE). While
   original contributions are pointed out and addressed appropriately, the
   efforts and contributions will be focussed on a relatively complete
   overview highlighting the field from one unified standpoint and clearly
   stating all assumptions that go into the approximations inherent to
   existing models. The contents will be divided as follows: In the first
   section the authors will give an overview of semi-classical phonon
   transport physics. Then the authors will discuss the equation of phonon
   radiative transport (EPRT) and its approximations-the
   ballistic-diffusive approximation (BDA) and the new heat equation (NHE).
   Next the authors derive and discuss the C-F model. A numerical
   discretization method valid for all models is then presented followed by
   results to numerical simulations and discussion.
   Findings - From a unified treatment based on the introduction of an
   energy distribution function, the authors have derived the EPRT and its
   two well-known approximations: BDA and NHE. For completeness and to
   provide a vehicle for a general numerical discretization approach, the
   authors have also included analysis of the C-F model and the parabolic
   and hyperbolic descriptions of heat transfer along with it. The
   approximation of angular dependence of phonons in radiation-like
   descriptions of transport has been given special attention. The
   assumption of isotropy was found to be of paramount importance in the
   formulation of position space models for phononic thermal transport. For
   the thin film problem considered here, the NHE along with the proper
   boundary condition appears to be the best choice to approximate the
   phonon BE. Not only does it provide predictions that are in excellent
   agreement with EPRT, it does not require the discretization of phase
   space making it far more computationally efficient.
   Originality/value - The authors hope this work will help dispel the idea
   that since Fourier's law describes diffusion (under limiting
   assumptions) and it has shown to be ineffective in describing heat
   transfer for very thin films, that diffusion cannot describe heat
   transfer in thin films and one should look to a radiative description
   instead. If one considers diffusion in the sense of random motion, as
   invisaged by the original builders of the subject (Smoluchowski,
   Einstein, Ornstein et al.), instead of a temperature gradient, the idea
   that diffusion can govern thermal transport at this scale is not
   surprising. Indeed, the NHE is essentially a diffusion equation that
   describes the motion of particles up to the point of true randomness
   (isotropy) as well as thereafter.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},

Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{302-315}},
Abstract = {{Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is associated with symptoms such
   as affect dysregulation, impaired sense of self, and self-harmbehaviors.
   Neuroimaging research on BPD has revealed structural and functional
   abnormalities in specific brain regions and connections. However, little
   is known about the topological organizations of brain networks in BPD.
   We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)
   data from 20 patients with BPD and 10 healthy controls, and constructed
   frequency-specific functional brain networks by correlating
   wavelet-filtered fMRI signals from 82 cortical and subcortical regions.
   We employed graph-theory based complex network analysis to investigate
   the topological properties of the brain networks, and employed
   network-based statistic to identify functional dysconnections in
   patients. In the 0.03-0.06 Hz frequency band, compared to controls,
   patients with BPD showed significantly larger measures of global network
   topology, including the size of largest connected graph component,
   clustering coefficient, small-worldness, and local efficiency,
   indicating increased local cliquishness of the functional brain network.
   Compared to controls, patients showed lower nodal centrality at several
   hub nodes but greater centrality at several non-hub nodes in the
   network. Furthermore, an interconnected subnetwork in 0.03-0.06 Hz
   frequency band was identified that showed significantly lower
   connectivity in patients. The links in the subnetwork were mainly
   long-distance connections between regions located at different lobes;
   and the mean connectivity of this subnetwork was negatively correlated
   with the increased global topology measures. Lastly, the key network
   measures showed high correlations with several clinical symptom scores,
   and classified BPD patients against healthy controls with high accuracy
   based on linear discriminant analysis. The abnormal topological
   properties and connectivity found in this study may add new knowledge to
   the current understanding of functional brain networks in BPD. However,
   due to limitation of small sample sizes, the results of the current
   study should be viewed as exploratory and need to be validated on large
   samples in future works. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Livestock manure waste, containing high level of phosphorus (P) will
   impair water environment if it is directly discharged to water body or
   improperly land applied. P recovery from animal manure not only
   addresses its environmental concerns, also provides a value added
   product as a fertilizer for better managing P. Electrocoagulation (EC)
   is proved to be an efficient approach that can be applied in the
   municipal and industrial wastewater for P removal and recovery; however,
   its application in the livestock manure management is less researched,
   especially with different selection of the electrode materials. In this
   study, EC process was evaluated on P removal and recovery from dairy
   manure. Four commonly seen electrodes, including Al, stainless steel,
   low carbon steel and cast iron, were compared. The results showed low
   carbon steel achieved the most efficient P removal (96.7\%). The average
   particle size of manure solids was increased from 32.2 to 126.9 mu m.
   The simulation experiment suggested that iron release and hydrolysis,
   which then worked as coagulants, is the major mechanism for P removal.
   EC by low carbon steel is an effective method for P separation from
   liquid phase of dairy manure to solid phase.}},

Abstract = {{The use of polymer light-emitting diodes (PLEDs) as future displays and
   lightings has been of interest because of their advantages such as
   lightness, thinness, high contrast ratio, fast response time and high
   flexibility. Light-extraction structures such as microlens arrays have
   been designed to improve the efficiency of PLEDs. In this work, we have
   fabricated novel microlens arrays based on an organic-inorganic hybrid
   sol on a flexible substrate. Al2O3 nanoparticles dispersed in microlens
   arrays are expected not only to extract more light but also to block gas
   molecules. Further light-extraction from Al2O3 nanoparticles in the
   microlens arrays was confirmed by an increase in diffusive reflectance
   and photoluminescence intensity. As a result, the flexible PLEDs with
   the arrays showed enhanced maximum current efficiencies by 47\% and 38\%
   for SPB-02T (blue) and PDY-132 (yellow) emissive materials. They also
   showed improved stability, and high flexibility at a bending radius of 4
   mm. Furthermore, Al2O3 nanoparticles were incorporated into irregular
   microlens arrays consisting of two different sizes of hemispherical
   lenses, to minimize changes in emission spectra and radiation pattern as
   well as to improve efficiency.}},

Title = {{Methylmercury production in a chronically sulfate-impacted sub-boreal
   wetland}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE-PROCESSES \& IMPACTS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{18}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{725-734}},
Abstract = {{Increased deposition of atmospheric sulfate exacerbates methylmercury
   (MeHg) production in freshwater wetlands by stimulating methylating
   bacteria, but it is unclear how methylation in sub-boreal wetlands is
   impacted by chronically elevated sulfate inputs, such as through mine
   discharges. The purpose of our study is to determine how sulfate
   discharges to wetlands from iron mining activities impact MeHg
   production. In this study, we compare spatial and temporal patterns in
   MeHg and associated geochemistry in two wetlands receiving contrasting
   loads of sulfate. Two orders of magnitude less sulfate in the
   un-impacted wetland create significant differences in acid-volatile
   sulfide and porewater sulfide; however, dissolved and solid-phase MeHg
   concentrations and methylation rate potentials (K-meth) are
   statistically similar in both wetlands. Permitted mine pumping events
   flood the sulfate-impacted wetland with very high sulfate waters during
   the fall. In contrast to observations in sulfate-limited systems, this
   large input of sulfate to a chronically sulfate-impacted system led to
   significantly lower potential relative methylation rates, suggesting a
   predominance of demethylation processes over methylation processes
   during the sulfate loading. Overall, short-term measurements of
   methylation and demethylation potential are unrelated to gross measures
   of long-term MeHg accumulation, indicating a decoupling of short-and
   long-term process measurements and an overall disequilibrium in the
   systems. High sulfide accumulation, above similar to 600-800 mu g l(-1)
   sulfide, in the sulfate-impacted system lowers long-term MeHg
   accumulation, perhaps as a result of less bioavailable Hg-S complexes.
   Although continued research is required to determine how sulfate-limited
   freshwater wetlands might respond to new, large inputs of high-sulfate
   runoff from mining operations, chronically impacted wetlands do not
   appear to continually accumulate or produce MeHg at rates different from
   wetlands unimpacted by mining.}},

Title = {{Preparation and evaluation of PCL-PEG-PCL polymeric nanoparticles for

Journal = {{RSC ADVANCES}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{60}},
Pages = {{54727-54737}},
Abstract = {{Doxorubicin (DOX), an anthracycline anticancer drug, was successfully
   incorporated into polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) based on
   poly(epsilon-caprolactone)-poly(ethylene
   glycol)-poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL-PEG-PCL) amphiphilic triblock
   copolymers by thin-film hydration and an ultrasonic dispersion method.
   The prepared DOX-loaded polymeric NPs showed spherical shapes with an
   apparent core-shell morphology. The average particle size of the
   DOX-loaded NPs was 130.8 nm with a narrow size distribution (PDI =
   0.200). DOX was entrapped in the polymeric NPs with an encapsulation
   efficiency and loading content of 86.71 +/- 2.05\% and 8.72 +/- 0.57\%,
   respectively. DOX-release from the NPs was by a sustained and long-term
   fashion up to several weeks, and achieved faster release at pH 5.5 than
   that at pH 7.0. An in vitro cytotoxicity assay against EMT6 cells
   demonstrated that the cytotoxic effect of DOX-loaded NPs gradually
   approached that of free DOX when increasing the concentration and the
   incubation time. Confocal laser scanning microscopy results showed that
   the DOX fluorescence was distributed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus
   for DOX-loaded NPs treated cells, while the red fluorescence was
   observed mostly in the nucleus for free DOX treated cells. A cell
   analyzer was used to further quantitatively analyze the intracellular
   distribution of DOX-loaded NPs on a cell-by-cell basis, indicating that
   DOX fluorescence in the nucleus was lower than that in the cytoplasm for
   1 h incubation, but higher than that in the cytoplasm for long-time
   incubation (4 h and 24 h). Furthermore, ex vivo DOX fluorescence imaging
   revealed that DOX-loaded NPs had highly efficient targeting and
   accumulation at the implanted site of an EMT6 xenograft tumor in vivo
   through an enhanced permeation and retention mechanism. These results
   suggest that the DOX-loaded polymeric NPs based on the PCL-PEG-PCL
   triblock copolymer would be a promising nanosized drug delivery system
   for cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of multiple radio interfaces on a single device,
   wireless mesh networks start to achieve significant improvement in
   network capacity, latency, and fault tolerance. The improvement is
   achieved through concurrent transmissions over different channels
   utilizing the multiple radio interfaces. However, the introduction of
   different channels over multiple radios on single mesh node compels to
   retrospect different issues such as interference, channel diversity, and
   channel switching from novel perspectives. Due to these novel
   perspectives, conventional channel assignment techniques proposed for
   single-radio wireless mesh networks are not generally applicable to the
   multiradio cases. Consequently, we have to reconsider the different
   issues while making a tradeoff among all the available channel
   assignment options to extract the best performance from a multiradio
   wireless mesh network. There are a number of research studies that
   propose various channel assignment techniques to extract the best
   performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on these
   studies. First, we point out various design issues pertinent to the
   techniques presented in the studies, and adopt the issues as the basis
   of our further discussion. Second, we briefly describe several important
   already-proposed channel assignment techniques. Third, we present a
   number of channel assignment metrics that are exploited by the
   already-proposed techniques. Then, depending on the considerations in
   these techniques, we categorize the techniques and present an exhaustive
   comparison among them. Nevertheless, we point out a number of real
   deployments and applications of these techniques in real scenarios.
   Finally, we identify several open issues for future research with their
   current status in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{The hydraulic human power amplifier is a tool that uses hydraulic
   actuation to amplify the force that the human exerts on it. Our control
   objective and framework are to make the system behave like a passive
   mechanical tool when interacting with the human and with the work
   environment with a specified power scaling factor. A virtual velocity
   coordination control approach casts the human power amplifier problem
   into one of velocity coordination by generating a fictitious reference
   mechanical system. Force amplification becomes a natural consequence of
   velocity coordination. This control has been previously demonstrated
   using servo valves which is a major contributor to energy loss in
   hydraulic system. In this paper, a hydraulic transformer, which does not
   rely on throttling to accomplish its control function is used instead of
   a servo valve to achieve human power amplification. In addition, a
   passivity based control approach that makes use of the natural energy
   storage of the hydraulic actuator is used to define the flow
   requirement. This approach fully accounts for the non-linearity due to
   the pressure dynamics. The controller was experimentally validated with
   good force amplification and velocity coordination performance on a
   single degree of freedom hydraulic human power amplifier.}},

Abstract = {{Angle-domain repetitive disturbances refer to disturbances that are
   periodic in a generic angle variable which is monotonically increasing
   with time but not uniformly. This paper extends the classical prototype
   repetitive control methodology for time periodic disturbances to this
   situation. Instead of using an internal model approach to derive the
   control, an affine parameterization approach is adopted which reduces
   the control design methodology to one of estimating and canceling the
   disturbance. While the resulting control architectures are similar to
   the classical time-domain periodic case, the stability conditions are
   different and depend on the choice of signal norms. Compensator design
   for non-minimum phase plants also need to be modified. Robustness is
   also considered in the L-2 setting and an affine Q-filter concept is
   introduced to achieve robust stability.}},

Abstract = {{The key component of Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system is an
   air compressor/expander. The roundtrip efficiency of this energy storage
   technology depends greatly on the efficiency of the air

   and power density of this component. Different ideas and approaches were
   introduced and studied in the previous works to improve this trade off
   by enhancing the heat transfer between air and its environment. In the
   present work, a combination of optimal compression/expansion rate,
   optimal chamber shape and optimal heat exchanger material distribution
   in the chamber is considered to maximize the power density of a
   compression/expansion chamber for a given desired efficiency. Results
   show that the power density can be improved by more than 20 folds if the
   optimal combination of flow rate, shape and porosity are used together.}},

Abstract = {{Slip control of a torque converter clutch (TCC) has been developed for
   years but most approaches are focused on time based methods without
   offering a systematic approach for dealing with the time-varying signals
   associated with the engine torque pulsation: As one of the major
   vibration sources of a vehicle, engine torque is periodic in the
   crankshaft rotational angle but aperiodic in time as the engine speed
   changes in real-time. This paper first presents a powertrain vibration
   analysis based on the transient engine torque input and the conventional
   TCC slip control. Simulation results show that the conventional
   time-based TCC slip control does not settle the periodic nature of the
   engine torque vibration with respect to crankshaft angle. However, a
   time-varying angle based control method can solve this issue. The paper
   then proposes an optimal TCC torque trajectory by using dynamic
   programming for this time-varying angle-based control method. Simulation
   results demonstrate the energy saving potential of the optimal
   trajectory over the conventional method.}},

Abstract = {{Dual-fuel reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) combustion
   can yield high thermal efficiency and simultaneously low NOx and soot
   emissions. Although soot emissions from RCCI is very low, hydrocarbon
   emissions are high, potentially resulting in higher than desired total
   particulate matter (PM) mass and number caused by semi volatile species
   converting the particle phase upon primary dilution in the exhaust
   plume. Such high organic fraction PM is known to be highly sensitive to
   the dilution conditions used when collecting samples on a filter or when
   measuring particle number using particle sizing instruments. In this
   study, PM emissions from a modified single-cylinder diesel engine
   operating in RCCI and conventional diesel combustion modes were
   investigated under different dilution conditions. To investigate the
   effect of the fumigated fuel on the PM emissions, 150 proof hydrous
   ethanol and gasoline were used as low reactivity fuels to study the
   relative contribution of fumigant versus directly injected fuel on the
   PM emissions. Our study found that PM from RCCI combustion is more
   sensitive to the variation of dilution conditions than PM from single
   fuel conventional diesel combustion. RCCI PM primarily consisted of
   semi-volatile organic compounds and a smaller amount of solid
   carbonaceous particles. The fumigated fuel had a significant effect on
   the PM emissions characteristics for RCCI combustion. Hydrous ethanol
   fueled RCCI PM contained a larger fraction of volatile materials and
   were more sensitive to the variation of dilution conditions compared to
   the gasoline fueled RCCI mode.}},

Abstract = {{Aftermarket dual-fuel injection systems in diesel engines using hydrous
   ethanol have been developed as a means to lower emissions from older
   diesel-powered equipment. However, our previous work has shown that the
   emissions benefits of currently available aftermarket intake fumigation
   injection systems can be inconsistent with manufacturer claims. Our
   current study evaluates a newly developed aftermarket dual fuel system
   that incorporates a novel fuel heating system and port fuel injection
   (PFI). This paper describes an experimental investigation of engine-out
   emissions from a John Deere 4045HF475 Tier 2 engine with port injection
   of 180 proof (90\% ethanol by volume) hydrous ethanol. The engine was
   retrofitted with a custom fuel heat exchanger to heat the hydrous
   ethanol to a range of 46-79 degrees C for helping to improve fuel
   vaporization in the intake port. PFI duration was controlled using
   engine speed and throttle position as inputs to achieve a desired
   fumigant energy fraction (FEF), defined as the amount of energy provided
   by the hydrous ethanol based on lower heating value (LHV) over the total
   fuel energy provided to the engine. Data was collected over a range of
   ELF with direct injected diesel for eight operating modes comparing
   heated versus unheated hydrous ethanol. Results of the study indicate
   that as FEF increases, NO emissions decrease, while NO2, CO, THC, and
   ethanol emissions increase. In addition, it was found that preheating
   the ethanol using engine coolant prior to injection has little benefit
   on engine-out emissions. The work shows that the implemented aftermarket
   dual-fuel PH system can achieve BET rates up to 37\% at low engine load
   while yielding modest benefits in emissions.}},

Title = {{Review of Brain-Machine Interfaces Used in Neural Prosthetics with New
   Perspective on Somatosensory Feedback through Method of Signal Breakdown}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFICA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{The brain-machine interface (BMI) used in neural prosthetics involves
   recording signals from neuron populations, decoding those signals using
   mathematical modeling algorithms, and translating the intended action
   into physical limb movement. Recently, somatosensory feedback has become
   the focus of many research groups given its ability in increased neural
   control by the patient and to provide a more natural sensation for the
   prosthetics. This process involves recording data from force sensitive
   locations on the prosthetics and encoding these signals to be sent to
   the brain in the form of electrical stimulation. Tactile sensation has
   been achieved through peripheral nerve stimulation and direct
   stimulation of the somatosensory cortex using intracortical
   microstimulation (ICMS). The initial focus of this paper is to review
   these principles and link them to modern day applications such as
   restoring limb use to those who lack such control. With regard to how
   far the research has come, a new perspective for the signal breakdown
   concludes the paper, offering ideas for more real somatosensory feedback
   using ICMS to stimulate particular sensations by differentiating touch
   sensors and filtering data based on unique frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we derive unique stochastic nonlinear coupled
   oscillator models of EEG signals from an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) study.
   EEG signals recorded during resting eyes-open (EO) and eyes-closed (EC)
   conditions in a pilot study with AD patients and age-matched healthy
   control subjects (CTL) are employed. An optimization scheme is then
   utilized to match the output of the stochastic Duffing-van der Pol
   double oscillator network with EEG signals recorded during each
   condition for AD and CTL subjects. The selected decision variable are
   the model parameters and noise intensity. While, the selected signal
   characteristics are power spectral densities in major brain frequency
   bands and Shannon and sample entropies to match the signal information
   content and complexity. It is shown that statistically significant
   unique models represent the EC and EO conditions for both CTL and AD
   subjects. Moreover, the inclusion of sample entropy in the optimization
   process significantly enhances the stochastic nonlinear oscillator model
   performance. The study suggests that EEG signals recorded under
   different brain states as well as those belonging to a brain disorder
   such as Alzheimer's disease can be uniquely represented by stochastic
   nonlinear oscillators paving the way for identification of new
   discriminants.}},

Abstract = {{Previously, the authors have proposed the concept of piston
   trajectory-based combustion control enabled by free piston engines
   (FPE). With this novel control method, the FPE realizes in-cycle
   real-time combustion control, in terms of adjusting the ignition timing
   and manipulating the in-cylinder temperature trace, through various
   piston trajectories and achieves higher thermal efficiency compared to
   the conventional internal combustion engines. In this paper, the effects
   of this new combustion control on engine-out emissions are studied.
   First, a model is developed that includes different piston trajectories
   in the FPE, a convective heat loss sub model and a reduced n-heptane
   reaction mechanism with major emissions species from diesel engines.
   Afterwards, a new approach which reduces the engine-out emissions by
   employing novel piston trajectories is described. At last, analyses of
   the simulation results demonstrating the variable piston trajectories'
   effects on CO and NOx emissions are presented, which further reveal the
   advantages of the trajectory-based combustion control.}},

Abstract = {{Assurance cases are used to document an argument that a system-such as a
   critical software system-satisfies some desirable property (e.g.,
   safety, security, or reliability). Demonstrating high confidence that
   the claims made based on an assurance case can be trusted is crucial to
   the success of the case. Researchers have proposed quantification of
   confidence as a Baconian probability ratio of eliminated concerns about
   the assurance case to the total number of identified concerns. In this
   paper, we extend their work by mapping this discrete ratio to a
   continuous probability distribution-a beta distribution-enabling
   different visualizations of the confidence in a claim. Further, the beta
   distribution allows us to quantify and visualize the uncertainty
   associated with the expressed confidence. Additionally, by transforming
   the assurance case into a reasoning structure, we show how confidence
   calculations can be performed using beta distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing atmospheric humidity and convective precipitation over land
   provide evidence of intensification of the hydrologic cycle - an
   expected response to surface warming. The extent to which terrestrial
   ecosystems modulate these hydrologic factors is important to understand
   feedbacks in the climate system. We measured the oxygen and hydrogen
   isotope composition of water vapor at a very tall tower (185aEuro-m) in
   the upper Midwest, United States, to diagnose the sources, transport,
   and fractionation of water vapor in the planetary boundary layer (PBL)
   over a 3-year period (2010 to 2012). These measurements represent the
   first set of annual water vapor isotope observations for this region.
   Several simple isotope models and cross-wavelet analyses were used to
   assess the importance of the Rayleigh distillation process, evaporation,
   and PBL entrainment processes on the isotope composition of water vapor.
   The vapor isotope composition at this tall tower site showed a large
   seasonal amplitude (mean monthly delta O-18(v) ranged from -40.2 to
   -15.9aEuro-aEuro degrees and delta H-2(v) ranged from -278.7 to
   -113.0aEuro-aEuro degrees) and followed the familiar Rayleigh
   distillation relation with water vapor mixing ratio when considering the
   entire hourly data set. However, this relation was strongly modulated by
   evaporation and PBL entrainment processes at timescales ranging from
   hours to several days. The wavelet coherence spectra indicate that the
   oxygen isotope ratio and the deuterium excess (d(v)) of water vapor are
   sensitive to synoptic and PBL processes. According to the phase of the
   coherence analyses, we show that evaporation often leads changes in
   d(v), confirming that it is a potential tracer of regional evaporation.
   Isotope mixing models indicate that on average about 31aEuro-\% of the
   growing season PBL water vapor is derived from regional evaporation.
   However, isoforcing calculations and mixing model analyses for high PBL
   water vapor mixing ratio events ( > aEuro-25aEuro-mmolaEuro-mol(-1))
   indicate that regional evaporation can account for 40 to 60aEuro-\% of
   the PBL water vapor. These estimates are in relatively good agreement
   with that derived from numerical weather model simulations. This
   relatively large fraction of evaporation-derived water vapor implies
   that evaporation has an important impact on the precipitation recycling
   ratio within the region. Based on multiple constraints, we estimate that
   the summer season recycling fraction is about 30aEuro-\%, indicating a
   potentially important link with convective precipitation.}},

   The movement of the contact line is modeled using a constant angle slip
   model. To solve this moving boundary problem, a numerical method is
   developed using a Galerkin/finite element method based approach. The
   numerical results show that the spreading rate of the fluid strongly
   depends on power law exponent n. It increases with the increase in the
   shear thinning character of the fluid (n < 1) and decreases with the
   increase in shear thickening nature of the fluid (n > 1). It is also
   observed that the capillary ridge becomes sharper with the value of n.
   In order to examine the stability of these ridges, a linear stability
   theory is also developed for these power law fluids. The dispersion
   relationship depicting the growth rate for a given wave number has been
   reported and compared for different power-law fluids. It is found that
   the growth rate of the instability decreases as the fluid becomes more
   shear thinning in nature, whereas it increases for more shear thickening
   fluids. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   wave field}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS OF FLUIDS}},
Year = {{2016}},

Abstract = {{Wind forcing makes a vital contribution to the hydrodynamic loads on
   structures at sea. The flow physics is complex, involving interactions
   among surface water waves, turbulent wind, and semi-submersed object. We
   perform a simulation-based study on a canonical problem of wind past a
   semi-submersed rectangular prism with the focus on the wave effect,
   which is an essential factor in wind loads at sea but has been elusive.
   To tackle this problem, we develop a hybrid simulation method consisting
   of two parts: a precursor simulation of coupled wind and wave motions in
   the far field upstream to provide physical inflow condition, and a
   near-field simulation of the air and water motions around the object.
   The simulation method is validated through numerical tests and
   comparisons with data from the literature for different aspects of the
   code. This hybrid simulation method is then applied to study the effect
   of surface wave motions on the wind load on the object. Various wave
   conditions are considered, including pure wind-sea satisfying the Joint
   North Sea Wave Project spectrum as well as wind-sea mixed with
   long-wavelength ocean swells. The simulation results exhibit significant
   oscillations in the wind load on the object. The oscillations are found
   to correlate well with the incident wave motions and are particularly
   strong in the presence of swells. The underlying mechanism is explained
   through analyses on variations of wind speed with different wave phases
   and wave-correlated flow patterns of the wind when it impinges on the
   object. Our simulations also indicate that waves have an appreciable
   effect on the wake behind the object. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Polymer flocculation is commonly used to remove colloidal material from
   solution, improving separation performance. The structure of the
   mesoscale formation (floc) affects process performance, as well as the
   amount of polymer required. By visualizing polymer in flocs using
   fluorescently-tagged polymers and laser confocal microscopy, we directly
   observe effects of ionic strength on polymer-clay floc internal
   structure. At low ionic strength, I < 10 mM NaCl, the polymer forms a
   continuous, interconnected internal network, whereas at high ionic
   strength, the polymer no longer forms this network and simply coats the
   larger bentonite aggregates. This method offers the ability to visualize
   the polymer structure without drying or freezing the solution, making it
   ideal for observation of delicate aggregates. While especially
   applicable to water purification, the structure observations shown here
   yield important fundamental insights for polymer adsorption dynamics
   onto inorganic heterogeneous particulate or surface structures. (C) 2016

   nanophosphors have been synthesized for bright dual-mode upconversion

   nanophosphors-Li(Gd,Y)F-4:Yb(18\%),Er(2\%)/LiYF4:Ce(15\%),Tb(15\%)/LiYF4
   -and the C/D-S structure has been proved by extensive scanning
   transmission electron microscopy (STEM) analysis. Colloidal LiYF4:Ce,Tb
   nanophosphors with a tetragonal bipyramidal shape are synthesized for
   the first time and they show intense DC green light via energy transfer
   from Ce3+ to Tb3+ under illumination with ultraviolet (UV) light. The
   LiYF4:Ce, Tb nanophosphors show 65 times higher photoluminescence
   intensity than LiYF4:Tb nanophosphors under illumination with UV light
   and the LiYF4:Ce,Tb is adapted into a luminescent shell of the
   tetragonal bipyramidal C/D-S nanophosphors. The formation of the DC
   shell on the core significantly enhances UC luminescence from the UC
   core under irradiation of near infrared light and concurrently generates
   DC luminescence from the core/shell nanophosphors under UV light.
   Coating with an inert inorganic shell further enhances the UC-DC
   dual-mode luminescence by suppressing the surface quenching effect. The
   C/D-S nanophosphors show 3.8\% UC quantum efficiency (QE) at 239 W
   cm(-2) and 73.0 +/- 0.1\% DC QE. The designed C/D-S architecture in
   tetragonal bipyramidal nanophosphors is rigorously verified by an energy
   dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) analysis, with the assistance of
   line profile simulation, using an aberration-corrected scanning
   transmission electron microscope equipped with a high-efficiency EDX.
   The feasibility of these C/D-S nanophosphors for transparent display
   devices is also considered.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic
   inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the CNS and results in
   neurological disability. Existing immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive
   approaches lower the number of relapses but do not cure or reverse
   existing deficits nor improve longterm disability in MS patients.
   Areas Covered: Monogenic antibodies were described as treatment options
   for MS, however the immunogenicity of mouse antibodies hampered the
   efficacy of potential therapeutics in humans. Availability of improved
   antibody production technologies resulted in a paradigm shift in MS
   treatment strategies. In this review, an overview of immunotherapies for
   MS that use conventional monoclonal antibodies reactive to immune system
   and their properties and mechanisms of action will be discussed,
   including recent advances in MS therapeutics and highlight natural
   autoantibodies (NAbs) that directly target CNS cells.
   Expert Opinion: Recent challenges for MS therapy are the identification
   of relevant molecular and cellular targets, time frame of treatment, and
   antibody toxicity profiles to identify safe treatment options for MS
   patients. The application of monoclonal antibody therapies with better
   biological efficacy associated with minimum side effects possesses huge
   clinical potential. Advances in monoclonal antibody technologies that
   directly target cells of nervous system may promote the CNS regeneration
   field from bench to bedside.}},

Abstract = {{A highly accurate noninvasive means of determining body core temperature
   is proposed and characterized by synergistic use of numerical and
   experimental simulations. It was demonstrated that the new surface probe
   yields skin surface temperature measurements that are within a few
   tenths of a degree of the body core temperature. Advanced simulation
   techniques such as the Monte Carlo method for the determination of
   radiant heat losses were used to ensure high accuracy. Convective heat
   losses were also accounted. Full account was taken of the multilayer
   nature of the tissue bed beneath the skin surface, each layer with its
   specific thermophysical properties, blood perfusion, and metabolic
   heating. For the validation of the numerical simulation model, an

Abstract = {{Recent years have witnessed several new promising technologies to power
   wireless sensor networks, which motivate some key topics to be
   revisited. By integrating sensing and computation capabilities to the
   traditional radio-frequency identification (RFID) tags, the Wireless
   Identification and Sensing Platform (WISP) is an open-source platform
   acting as a pioneering experimental platform of wireless rechargeable
   sensor networks. Different from traditional tags, an RFID-based wireless
   rechargeable sensor node needs to charge its onboard energy storage
   above a threshold to power its sensing, computation, and communication
   components. Consequently, such charging delay imposes a unique design
   challenge for deploying wireless rechargeable sensor networks. In this
   paper, we tackle this problem by planning the optimal movement strategy
   of the mobile RFID reader, such that the time to charge all nodes in the
   network above their energy threshold is minimized. We first propose an
   optimal solution using the linear programming (LP) method. To further
   reduce the computational complexity, we then introduce a heuristic
   solution with a provable approximation ratio of (1 + theta)/(1 -
   epsilon) by discretizing the charging power on a 2-D space. Through
   extensive evaluations, we demonstrate that our design outperforms the
   set-cover-based design by an average of 24.7\%, whereas the
   computational complexity is O((N/epsilon)(2)). Finally, we consider two
   practical issues in system implementation and provide guidelines for
   parameter setting.}},

Journal = {{IIE TRANSACTIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{48}},
Number = {{3, SI}},
Pages = {{193-204}},
Abstract = {{Transit agencies use reserve drivers to cover open work that arises from
   planned and unplanned time off, equipment breakdowns, weather, and
   special events. Work assignment decisions must be made sequentially
   without information about future job requests, a driver's earlier
   assignment may not be interrupted to accommodate a new job (no
   pre-emption), and the scheduler may need to select a particular driver
   when multiple drivers can perform a job. Motivated by this instance of
   the interval scheduling problem, we propose a randomized algorithm that
   carries a performance guarantee relative to the best offline solution
   and simultaneously performs better than any deterministic algorithm. A
   key objective of this article is to develop an algorithm that performs
   well in both average and worst-case scenarios. For this reason, our
   approach includes discretionary parameters that allow the user to
   achieve a balance between a myopic approach (accept all jobs that can be
   scheduled) and a strategic approach (consider accepting only if jobs are
   longer than a certain threshold). We test our algorithm on data from a
   large transit agency and show that it performs well relative to the
   commonly used myopic approach. Although this article is motivated by a
   transit industry application, the approach we develop is applicable in a
   whole host of applications involving on-demand-processing of jobs.

Abstract = {{Bioinspired organ-level in vitro platforms are emerging as effective
   technologies for fundamental research, drug discovery, and personalized
   healthcare. In particular, models for nervous system research are
   especially important, due to the complexity of neurological phenomena
   and challenges associated with developing targeted treatment of
   neurological disorders. Here we introduce an additive
   manufacturing-based approach in the form of a bioinspired, customizable
   3D printed nervous system on a chip (3DNSC) for the study of viral
   infection in the nervous system. Micro-extrusion 3D printing strategies
   enabled the assembly of biomimetic scaffold components (microchannels
   and compartmented chambers) for the alignment of axonal networks and
   spatial organization of cellular components. Physiologically relevant
   studies of nervous system infection using the multiscale biomimetic
   device demonstrated the functionality of the in vitro platform. We found
   that Schwann cells participate in axon-to-cell viral spread but appear
   refractory to infection, exhibiting a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of
   1.4 genomes per cell. These results suggest that 3D printing is a
   valuable approach for the prototyping of a customized model nervous
   system on a chip technology.}},

Journal = {{AUTOPHAGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},

Pages = {{547-564}},
Abstract = {{ULK1 (unc-51 like autophagy activating kinase 1), the key mediator of
   MTORC1 signaling to autophagy, regulates early stages of autophagosome
   formation in response to starvation or MTORC1 inhibition. How ULK1
   regulates the autophagy induction process remains elusive. Here, we
   identify that ATG13, a binding partner of ULK1, mediates interaction of
   ULK1 with the ATG14-containing PIK3C3/VPS34 complex, the key machinery
   for initiation of autophagosome formation. The interaction enables ULK1
   to phosphorylate ATG14 in a manner dependent upon autophagy inducing
   conditions, such as nutrient starvation or MTORC1 inhibition. The ATG14
   phosphorylation mimics nutrient deprivation through stimulating the
   kinase activity of the class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase
   (PtdIns3K) complex and facilitates phagophore and autophagosome
   formation. By monitoring the ATG14 phosphorylation, we determined that
   the ULK1 activity requires BECN1/Beclin 1 but not the
   phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-conjugation machinery and the PIK3C3
   kinase activity. Monitoring the phosphorylation also allowed us to
   identify that ATG9A is required to suppress the ULK1 activity under
   nutrient-enriched conditions. Furthermore, we determined that ATG14
   phosphorylation depends on ULK1 and dietary conditions in vivo. These
   results define a key molecular event for the starvation-induced
   activation of the ATG14-containing PtdIns3K complex by ULK1, and
   demonstrate hierarchical relations between the ULK1 activation and other
   autophagy proteins involved in phagophore formation.}},

Abstract = {{A three dimensional CFD analysis of a novel vane pump power split
   transmission is studied in this paper. The model was built using
   PumpLinx, a three-dimensional CFD commercial code developed by Simerics
   Inc. The Mathers Hydraulics vane pump is a double-acting vane pump with
   a floating ring. By coupling the floating ring to an output shaft, the
   vane pump becomes a hydrostatic transmission. The focus of this activity
   is the optimization of the vane pump analyzing the internal fluid
   dynamics of each part during the pump operation and redesign. The study
   is a result of collaboration between the University of Minnesota and the
   University of Naples ``Federico II{''} research groups. The universities
   involved in this project worked in close cooperation on these
   simulations. A prototype pump will be tested on a hydraulic test bench
   at the University of Minnesota, and the experimental data will be used
   to validate the simulation model.}},

Abstract = {{A miniature free-piston engine air compressor is under development as a
   portable compact power supply. The performance of the air compressor
   side of the device was measured by separating the compressor portion
   from the free-piston engine and bench testing it independently. The
   compressor was operated over a speed range of 1000 to 10,000 cycles per
   minute, and output mass flow of air was measured with a load pressure
   range of 0 to 415 kPa (0 to 60 psi) above ambient. Two thermodynamic
   models of the air compressor were created. The first divided the
   compressor cycle into four ideal gas processes. The second model
   simulated the cycle through many small steps, calculating the
   thermodynamic states iteratively using conservation of energy for an
   open system. Valve effects and leakage losses were included in both
   models. The models were validated by comparing the results with
   experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Throttling loss is a major contributor to the low system efficiency in
   hydraulic systems. Hydraulic transformers can potentially be an energy
   efficient, throttle-less control approach for multi-actuators systems
   powered by a common pressure rail (CPR). The transformer transforms the
   input CPR pressure to the desired pressure of the actuator instead of
   throttling it. Regenerative energy can also be captured. For
   transformers to be useful, they must also have good control performance.
   This paper presents a a passivity based trajectory tracking controller
   for a hydraulic actuator driven by a transformer consisting of two
   mechanically coupled variable displacement pump/motors. In addition to
   controlling the motion of the actuator, the transformer speed can also
   be regulated at the most efficient operating speed. The nonlinear
   controller is designed using a Lyapunov function that is based upon a
   recently discovered natural energy storage function for hydraulic
   actuators. Experimental results validate the efficacy of this controller}},

Abstract = {{A novel Vane Pump Power Split Transmission (VPPST), applied to a class 1
   pickup truck, is demonstrated in this paper. The VPPST, a power split
   hydraulic transmission consists of Vane Pump Power Split Unit (VPSU) and
   a variable displacement hydraulic motor. The VPSU is a double acting
   vane pump with a floating ring. The floating ring is coupled to the
   output shaft, which is connected to the drive shaft. The input shaft of
   the VPSU is coupled to the engine. The control flow of the VPSU is fed
   to a variable displacement motor mounted on the VPSU output shaft. The
   transmission ratio is adjusted by controlling the displacement of the
   variable motor. The resulting continuous variable transmission allows
   for optimum engine operation by decoupling the engine speed from the
   drive speed. The transmission also has an integral clutch that allows
   de-clutching the engine from the drive train by retracting the vanes of
   the VPSU. In this paper, a quasi-static simulation approach is used to
   study the performance of the transmission.}},

Abstract = {{The timing of the valves of a hydraulic motor plays an important role in
   determining the throttling energy. To reduce this dominating energy
   loss, the timing of the valves must allow the fluid in the chamber to be
   precompressed and decompressed such that there is minimal pressure
   differential across the transitioning valve. The optimal valve timing to
   achieve precompression and decompression is a function of the motor
   displacement, angular velocity, pressure, and air content of the fluid,
   thus to achieve high efficiency at all conditions, active valve timing
   is required. The valves in most hydraulic motor architectures are
   mechanically timed to the piston displacement, rendering it impossible
   to change the valve timing as a function of operating conditions. This
   paper presents one novel valve architecture that allows for such
   processes: a rotary valve that is controlled independently of the piston
   displacement, enabling active timing control. To validate the concept
   and test the motor valve at fixed timing and fixed displacement
   conditions, a prototype valve was installed on a single cylinder 3.5
   cc/rev slider-crank piston motor. The nominal timing of the valve was
   optimized for operation for a pressure of 7 MPa, 2\% entrained air by
   volume, and an angular velocity between 10 and 30 Hz. A model, including
   the pressure dynamics, leakage, compressibility, check valve dynamics,
   and geometry dependent parameters is developed, simulated, and compared
   to the experiment. The experimental system includes instrumentation for
   measuring the inlet and outlet flow rates, piston position, and pressure
   in the inlet, outlet, and cylinder. A comparison between the model and
   experimental data shows good agreement and demonstrate the large impact
   of valve timing on efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{A key component of switch-mode hydraulic circuits is a highspeed
   two-position three-way valve with a variable duty cycle. This paper
   presents a new valve architecture that consists of two valve spools that
   are axially driven by crank-slider mechanisms. By phase shifting the two
   crank links, which are on a common crankshaft, the duty cycle of the
   valve is adjusted. The two spools split and re-combine flow such that
   two switching cycles occur per revolution of the crankshaft. Because the
   spools move in a near-sinusoidal trajectory, the peak spool velocities
   are achieved at mid-stroke where the valve land transitions across the
   ports, resulting in short valve transition times. The spool velocity is
   lower during the remainder of the cycle, reducing viscous friction
   losses. A dynamic model is constructed of this new valve operating at
   120 Hz switching frequency in a switch-mode circuit. The model is used
   to illustrate design trade-offs and minimize energy losses in the valve.
   The resulting design solution transitions to the on state in 5\% of the
   switching period and the combined leakage and viscous friction in the
   valve dissipate 1.7\% of the total power at a pressure of 34.5MPa and
   volumetric flow rate of 22.8L/min.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual integration techniques focus on building architectural models of
   systems that can be analyzed early in the design cycle to try to lower
   cost, reduce risk, and improve quality of complex embedded systems.
   Given appropriate architectural descriptions, assume/guarantee
   contracts, and compositional reasoning rules, these techniques can be
   used to prove important safety properties about the architecture prior
   to system construction. For these proofs to be meaningful, each
   leaf-level component contract must be realizable; i.e., it is possible
   to construct a component such that for any input allowed by the contract
   assumptions, there is some output value that the component can produce
   that satisfies the contract guarantees.
   We have recently proposed (in {[}1]) a contract-based realizability
   checking algorithm for assume/guarantee contracts over infinite theories
   supported by SMT solvers such as linear integer/real arithmetic and
   uninterpreted functions. In that work, we used an SMT solver and an
   algorithm similar to k-induction to establish the realizability of a
   contract, and justified our approach via a hand proof. Given the central
   importance of realizability to our virtual integration approach, we
   wanted additional confidence that our approach was sound. This paper
   describes a complete formalization of the approach in the Coq proof and
   specification language. During formalization, we found several small
   mistakes and missing assumptions in our reasoning. Although these did
   not compromise the correctness of the algorithm used in the checking
   tools, they point to the value of machine-checked formalization. In
   addition, we believe this is the first machine-checked formalization for
   a realizability algorithm.}},

   the original matrix, and for this reason it has played an important role
   in applications ranging from density functional theory in electronic
   structure calculations to matrix completion problems in machine
   learning, and subspace tracking in signal processing applications. This
   note explores its convergence properties in the presence of
   perturbations. The specific question addressed is the following. If we
   apply the subspace iteration algorithm to a certain matrix and this
   matrix is perturbed at each step, under what conditions will the
   algorithm converge?}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a multilevel preconditioning technique for solving
   sparse symmetric linear systems of equations. This ``Multilevel Schur
   Low-Rank{''} (MSLR) preconditioner first builds a tree structure T based
   on a hierarchical decomposition of the matrix and then computes an
   approximate inverse of the original matrix level by level. Unlike
   classical direct solvers, the construction of the MSLR preconditioner
   follows a top-down traversal of T and exploits a low-rank property that
   is satisfied by the difference between the inverses of the local Schur
   complements and specific blocks of the original matrix. A few steps of
   the generalized Lanczos tridiagonalization procedure are applied to
   capture most of this difference. Numerical results are reported to
   illustrate the efficiency and robustness of the MSLR preconditioner with
   both two-and three-dimensional discretized PDE problems and with
   publicly available test problems.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we study multivariate polynomial functions in complex

   focus is to find conditions under which such complex polynomials always

   complex polynomials to be real valued, and present their corresponding
   tensor representations. New notions of eigenvalues/eigenvectors for
   complex tensors are introduced, extending similar properties from the
   Hermitian matrices. Moreover, we study a property of the symmetric
   tensors, namely, the largest eigenvalue (in the absolute value sense) of
   a real symmetric tensor is equal to its largest singular value; the
   result is also known as Banach's theorem. We show that a similar result
   holds for the complex case as well. Finally, we discuss some
   applications of the new notion of eigenvalues/eigenvectors for the

   the observation that FISTA is an accelerated ISTA process, and a
   spectral analysis of the associated matrix operators, we show that
   FISTA's convergence rate can slow down as it proceeds, eventually
   becoming slower than ISTA. This observation leads to a proposed

   compared to FISTA, as measured by the decrease in the objective

Journal = {{SIAM JOURNAL ON OPTIMIZATION}},

Abstract = {{The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is widely used to
   solve large-scale linearly constrained optimization problems, convex or
   nonconvex, in many engineering fields. However there is a general lack
   of theoretical understanding of the algorithm when the objective
   function is nonconvex. In this paper we analyze the convergence of the
   ADMM for solving certain nonconvex consensus and sharing problems. We
   show that the classical ADMM converges to the set of stationary
   solutions, provided that the penalty parameter in the augmented
   Lagrangian is chosen to be sufficiently large. For the sharing problems,
   we show that the ADMM is convergent regardless of the number of variable
   blocks. Our analysis does not impose any assumptions on the iterates
   generated by the algorithm and is broadly applicable to many ADMM
   variants involving proximal update rules and various flexible block
   selection rules.}},

Abstract = {{Cholera is an infectious disease responsible for roughly 3-5 million
   morbidities and 100,000-120,000 mortalities every year at the global
   scale. Frequent cholera outbreaks in the recent history suggest
   unresolved inefficiency issues with regards to cholera prevention and
   intervention strategies. Guidelines of the World Health Organizations
   (WHO) advise country governments facing threats of cholera epidemics to
   prevent and control potential outbreaks by developing effective
   sanitation, proper waste management strategies and vaccination
   campaigns. These controls do not envision any focus on environmental
   determinants of cholera outbreaks. Failing to select the most
   appropriate prevention and intervention strategies at the health
   management scale based on public health, environmental, and social
   determinants is the fundamental cause for the low effectiveness of
   cholera outbreak containment strategies. This study targets this
   inefficiency via the creation of a model-based technology that detects
   the optimal combination of outbreak controls which minimize the number
   of cases at the system scale. As a case study we consider cholera but
   the model can be applied to any syndemic and/or complex diseases
   affected by natural and human systems. The technology is based on the
   integration of an epidemiology model that processes public health
   information and predicts population dynamics during the epidemic, an
   environmental model that predicts environmental fluxes (i.e., hydrologic
   fluxes) and a mobility model that predicts human fluxes. Results from
   the physical based model feeds a Portfolio Decision Model (PDM) that is
   composed by a Multi-Criteria Disease Analysis (MCDA) and a Pareto
   optimization model. The MCDA model is used for the static evaluation of
   the feasible controls at the smallest community scale; the Pareto
   optimization detects the most appropriate control strategy rather than
   one single control alternative. Preliminary applications of the model
   applied to the great Kolkata ecosystem shows an average 35 \% decrease
   in incidence for the portfolio versus the monocontrol scenario.
   Acknowledging spatial sensitivities in the epidemiological dynamics, PDM
   benefits public health management concerned with multiple populations
   with heterogeneous dependencies occurring simultaneously. PDM considers
   public health management scales and optimizes the distribution of
   economic resources for minimizing the risk of infection at the system
   scale. A major innovation is constituted by the explicit consideration
   of environmental dynamics, global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis,
   and MCDA that is particularly relevant for bringing together biophysical
   factors and stakeholder preferences in the decision making process. The
   model can be extended from one disease to syndemics linked together by
   common socio-environmental drivers or the structure of the natural-human
   systems responsible for their spreading.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we discuss the use of low frequency (up to 300 MHz) radio
   waves (RF) to detect and characterize electrical defects present in the
   dielectrics of emerging integrated circuit devices. As an illustration,
   the technique is used to monitor the impact of thermal cycling on the RF
   signal characteristics (S-parameters, such as S-11 and S-21) of
   electrically active defects in three dimensional (3D) interconnects. The
   observed changes in the electrical characteristics of the interconnects
   were traced to changes in the chemistry of the isolation dielectric used
   in the through silicon via (TSV) construction; specifically to the
   conversion of chemical intermediates such as non-bridging silanol
   (Si-OH) to bridging siloxane (Si-O-Si). We suggest that these ``chemical
   defects{''} inherent in the `as-manufactured' products may be
   responsible for some of the unexplained early reliability failures
   observed in TSV enabled 3D devices. This low frequency RF technique
   could be optimized to complement, and in some cases compete favorably
   with, other thin film metrology techniques, such as ellipsometry and
   Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), for mass production
   environments. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS.}},

Title = {{Energy Efficiency Optimization for Mobile Ad Hoc Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{928-940}},
Abstract = {{Tremendous traffic demands for ubiquitous access and emerging multimedia
   applications significantly increase the energy consumption of
   battery-powered mobile devices. This trend leads to that energy
   efficiency (EE) becomes an essential aspect of mobile ad hoc networks
   (MANETs). In this paper, we explore EE optimization as measured in bits
   per Joule for MANETs based on the cross-layer design paradigm. We model
   this problem as a nonconvex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP)
   formulation by jointly considering routing, traffic scheduling, and
   power control. Because the nonconvex MINLP problem is NP-hard in
   general, it is exceedingly difficult to globally optimize this problem.
   We, therefore, devise a customized branch and bound (BB) algorithm to
   efficiently solve this globally optimal problem. The novelties of our
   proposed BB algorithm include upper and lower bounding schemes and
   branching rule that are designed using the characteristics of the
   nonconvex MINLP problem. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed
   BB algorithm by offering numerical comparisons with a reference
   algorithm that uses the relaxation manners proposed in {[}1] {[}3].
   Numerical results show that our proposed BB algorithm scheme,
   respectively, decreases the optimality gap 81.98\% and increases the
   best feasible solution 32.79\% compared with the reference algorithm.
   Furthermore, our results not only provide insights into the design of EE
   maximization algorithms for MANETs by employing cooperations between
   different layers but also serve as performance benchmarks for
   distributed protocols developed for real-world applications.}},

Abstract = {{A broad-based research team developed a Health Insurance Portability and
   Accountability Act (HIPAA)-compliant educational website for women with
   ovarian cancer to improve the quality of supportive oncology care. Prior
   to a randomized clinical trial of the website, initial usability testing
   was implemented to evaluate the website. The initial review found that
   165/247 checklist items had sufficient information to allow for
   evaluation with the website achieving an overall score of 63\%. By
   category, the lowest scores were for the Home Page, Task Orientation,
   Page Layout \& Visual Design, and Help, Feedback \& Error Tolerance.
   Major issues thought to potentially impede actual usage were prioritized
   in redevelopment and the second usability review, conducted by the same
   expert, saw an improvement in scores. Incorporating usability concepts
   from the start of development, fulfilling the positive expectations of
   end-users, and identifying the technical and personal factors that
   optimize use may greatly enhance the usage of health websites.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss adaptive numerical methods for the solution of eigenvalue
   problems arising either from the finite element discretization of a
   partial differential equation (PDE) or from discrete finite element
   modeling. When a model is described by a partial differential equation,
   the adaptive finite element method starts from a coarse finite element
   mesh which, based on a posteriori error estimators, is adaptively
   refined to obtain eigenvalue/eigenfunction approximations of prescribed
   accuracy. This method is well established for classes of elliptic PDEs,
   but is still in its infancy for more complicated PDE models. For complex
   technical systems, the typical approach is to directly derive finite
   element models that are discrete in space and are combined with
   macroscopic models to describe certain phenomena like damping or
   friction. In this case one typically starts with a fine uniform mesh and
   computes eigenvalues and eigenfunctions using projection methods from
   numerical linear algebra that are often combined with the algebraic
   multilevel substructuring method to achieve an adequate performance.
   These methods work well in practice but their convergence and error
   analysis is rather difficult. We analyze the relationship between these
   two extreme approaches. Both approaches have their pros and cons which
   are discussed in detail. Our observations are demonstrated with several
   numerical examples.}},

   challenging problem. A recent introduction of array ultrasonic dry point
   contact transducer systems offers opportunities for quantitative
   assessment of the subsurface condition of concrete structures, including
   detection of defects and inclusions. The methods described in this paper
   are developed for signal interpretation of shear wave impulse response
   time histories from multiple fixed distance transducer pairs in a
   self-contained ultrasonic linear array. This included generalizing
   Kirchoff migration-based synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT)
   reconstruction methods to handle the spatially diverse transducer pair
   locations, creating expanded virtual arrays with associated
   reconstruction methods, and creating automated reconstruction
   interpretation methods for reinforcement detection and stochastic flaw
   detection. Interpretation of the reconstruction techniques developed in
   this study were validated using the results of laboratory and field
   forensic studies. Applicability of the developed methods for solving
   practical engineering problems was demonstrated.}},

   faster and more accurate analysis of complex mixtures commonly

   performance with improved recalcitrance to deactivation, which was
   attributed to its low activity for the hydrolysis of DMF to
   2,5-hexanedione and subsequent condensation. Zr-BEA also achieved the
   highest selectivity to p-xylene of 90\% at 99\% conversion of DMF. For
   low catalyst loading within a three-phase reactor, the reaction rate to
   form p-xylene was linearly proportional to the number of Lewis acid
   sites, while high catalyst loading exhibited zero order dependence on
   Lewis acid sites. A maximum achievable reaction rate was shown to be
   consistent with a transition in rate-limiting reactions from dehydration

Abstract = {{Recently, motivated both by basic scientific interest and technological
   applications, and utilizing both experiment and theory, a number of
   investigators have independently identified a small group of
   off-stoichiometric Heusler alloys as having unusually interesting
   magnetic properties. These alloys take the form
   Ni(50-x)Co(x)Mn(25+y)Z(25-y) (Z = Sn, In, Ga, etc.), being Co-doped
   off-stoichiometric versions of the better-known Ni(2)MnZ full Heusler
   compounds. In certain critical composition ranges these alloys are found
   to display unusually reversible martensitic phase transformations,
   multiferroicity (due to coexisting ferroelasticity and magnetic order),
   heightened sensitivity to compositional changes, and acute magnetic
   phase competition, leading to such exotic phenomena as spontaneous
   nanoscale magnetic inhomogeneity, collective cluster freezing, and
   intrinsic exchange bias. In terms of applications they can
   exhibitmagnetic-field-induced phase transformations, magnetic shape
   memory behavior, magnetocaloric effects, and remarkably low thermal
   hysteresis, making them attractive for sensors and actuators, magnetic
   refrigeration, and energy conversion devices. In this chapter we briefly
   review the current state of knowledge on the magnetic properties of
   these alloys, before presenting new results on the prototypical
   Ni50-xCoxMn40Sn10 system in the critical composition range0 <= x <= 14.
   Combining comprehensive magnetometry, exchange bias studies, and both
   new and previously published neutron scattering data, we present a
   detailed picture of the magnetic phenomenology in this alloy system and
   construct a magnetic phase diagram. Most importantly, based on these
   results and the work of others, we discuss in detail potential origins
   of the unusual magnetic properties of these materials, most notably the
   magnetic phase competition and nanoscale inhomogeneity that dominate
   their low temperature magnetism.}},

Abstract = {{Heusler alloys, particularly in the family Ni(2)MnZ (Z= Ga, In, Sn and
   Sb) and nearby compositions, often exhibitmartensitic phase
   transformation from a high-temperature cubic (L2(1)) structure to a
   low-temperature, low-symmetry martensitic phase. These transformations
   are commonly accompanied by a change in magnetic ordering, due to the
   sensitivity of spin interactions to the change in interatomic distances
   and local symmetry. Various forms of energy can be made to interconvert
   during this multiferroic phase transformation. A particularly
   interesting family of alloys for this purpose is
   Ni(50-x)Co(x)Mn(25-y)Z(y) (Z = Ga, In, Sn and Sb). Over a small
   compositional range, the phase transformation in these alloys is
   accompanied by a large change in magnetization-up to 1.2MA/m
   (1200emu/cm(3)) in Ni45Co5Mn40Sn10. In such materials it is possible to
   design an energy conversion device that directly converts heat to
   electricity using Faraday's law of induction and cyclic phase
   transformation. Both the efficiency and work output per volume of such
   an energy conversion device are significantly affected by the size of
   the hysteresis, which is however tunable in these systems. A
   thermodynamic theory for such a energy conversion method is presented
   based on a free energy function that includes contributions from phase
   transformation and magnetism. Material constants in the free energy
   functions are determined by magnetic and calorimetric measurements. We
   give the estimates of efficiency and power output in terms of material
   constants, design parameters and working conditions for this energy
   conversion method. The first-order nature of the phase transformation,
   leading to an effect of magnetic field on transformation temperature and
   a mixed-phase region, play a critical role for the effectiveness of
   these methods.}},

Abstract = {{Arising from the water-driven self-assembly of amphiphiles over
   generally narrow temperature and composition phase windows, aqueous
   lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) network phases are useful in applications
   as therapeutic delivery vehicles and templates for mesoporous material
   syntheses. While a clear set of amphiphile design rules that enables
   access to these intricate three-dimensional structures has yet to
   emerge, recent work indicates that bis(ammonium), bis(phosphonium), and
   dicarboxylate gemini ({''}twin tail{''}) surfactants enable enhanced
   access to LLC network phases such as the double gyroid (G). In order to
   better understand the scope of this amphiphile design strategy, we
   investigated the synthesis and aqueous LLC self-assembly behaviors of a
   homologous series of quaternary gemini bis(ammonium) dichloride
   surfactants, in which we varied the position of the hydrophobic linker
   that connects the constituent single tail surfactants. These experiments
   demonstrate that the position of the linker directly impacts the maximum
   counterion-headgroup hydration capacity and the extent of
   counterion-headgroup association, all of which contribute to the aqueous
   lyotropic double gyroid network phase stability. Thus, judicious
   selection of the linker position in ionic gemini surfactants provides a
   new molecular design tool for manipulating LLC network phase stability.}},

Abstract = {{The large eddy simulation (LES) module of the Virtual StreamLab (VSL3D)
   model is applied to simulate the flow and transport of a conservative
   tracer in a headwater stream in Minnesota, located in the south Twin
   Cities metropolitan area. The detailed geometry of the stream reach,
   which is approximate to 135m long, approximate to 2.5m wide, and
   approximate to 0.15m deep, was surveyed and used as input to the
   computational model. The detailed geometry and location of large woody
   debris and bed roughness elements up to approximate to 0.1m in size were
   also surveyed and incorporated in the numerical simulation using the
   Curvilinear Immersed Boundary approach employed in VSL3D. The resolution
   of the simulation, which employs up to a total of 25million grid nodes
   to discretize the flow domain, is sufficiently fine to directly account
   for the effect of large woody debris and small cobbles (on the
   streambed) on the flow patterns and transport processes of conservative
   solutes. Two tracer injection conditions, a pulse and a plateau release,
   and two cross sections of measured velocity were used to validate the
   LES results. The computed results are shown to be in good agreement with
   the field measurements and tracer concentration time series. To our
   knowledge, the present study is the first attempt to simulate via
   high-resolution LES solute transport in a natural stream environment
   taking into account a range of roughness length scales spanning an order
   of magnitude: from small cobbles on the streambed (approximate to 0.1m
   in diameter) to large woody debris up to approximate to 3m long.}},

Journal = {{ANALYST}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1363-1375}},
Abstract = {{We apply liquid nebulization (LN) in series with ion mobility
   spectrometry (IMS, using a differential mobility analyzer coupled to a
   condensation particle counter) to measure the size distribution
   functions (the number concentration per unit log diameter) of gold
   nanospheres in the 5-30 nm range, 70 nm x 11.7 nm gold nanorods, and
   albumin proteins originally in aqueous suspensions. In prior studies,
   IMS measurements have only been carried out for colloidal nanoparticles
   in this size range using electrosprays for aerosolization, as
   traditional nebulizers produce supermicrometer droplets which leave
   residue particles from non-volatile species. Residue particles mask the
   size distribution of the particles of interest. Uniquely, the LN
   employed in this study uses both online dilution (with dilution factors
   of up to 104) with ultra-high purity water and a ball-impactor to remove
   droplets larger than 500 nm in diameter. This combination enables
   hydrosol-to-aerosol conversion preserving the size and morphology of
   particles, and also enables higher non-volatile residue tolerance than
   electrospray based aerosolization. Through LN-IMS measurements we show
   that the size distribution functions of narrowly distributed but
   similarly sized particles can be distinguished from one another, which
   is not possible with Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis in the sub-30 nm
   size range. Through comparison to electron microscopy measurements, we
   find that the size distribution functions inferred via LN-IMS
   measurements correspond to the particle sizes coated by surfactants,
   i.e. as they persist in colloidal suspensions. Finally, we show that the
   gas phase particle concentrations inferred from IMS size distribution
   functions are functions of only of the liquid phase particle
   concentration, and are independent of particle size, shape, and chemical
   composition. Therefore LN-IMS enables characterization of the size,
   yield, and polydispersity of sub-30 nm particles.}},

Abstract = {{The development and thorough characterization of nonviral delivery
   agents for nucleic acid and genome editing therapies are of high
   interest to the field of nano medicine. Indeed, this vehicle class
   offers the ability to tune chemical architecture/biological activity and
   readily package nucleic acids of various sizes and morphologies for a
   variety of applications. Herein, we present the synthesis and
   characterization of a class of trehalose-based block copolycations
   designed to stabilize polyplex formulations for lyophilization and in
   vivo administration. A 6-methacrylamido-6-deoxy trehalose (MAT) monomer
   was synthesized from trehalose and polymerized via reversible addition
   fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization to yield pMAT(43).
   The pMAT(43) macro-chain transfer agent was then chain-extended with
   aminoethylmethacrylamide (AEMA) to yield three different pMAT-b-AEMA
   cationic-block copolymers, pMAT-b-AEMA-1 (21 AEMA repeats), -2 (44 AEMA
   repeats), and -3 (57 AEMA repeats). These polymers along with a series
   of controls were used to form polyplexes with plasmids encoding firefly
   luciferase behind a strong ubiquitous promoter. The trehalose-coated
   polyplexes were characterized in detail and found to be resistant to
   colloidal aggregation in culture media containing salt and serum. The
   trehalose-polyplexes also retained colloidal stability and promoted high
   gene expression following lyophilization and reconstitution.
   Cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and transfection ability were assessed in
   vitro using both human glioblastoma (U87) and human liver carcinoma
   (HepG2) cell lines wherein pMAT-b-AEMA-2 was found to have the optimal
   combination of high gene expression and low toxicity. pMAT-b-AEMA-2
   polyplexes were evaluated in mice via slow tail vein infusion. The
   vehicle displayed minimal toxicity and discouraged nonspecific
   internalization in the liver, kidney, spleen, and lungs as determined by
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and fluorescence imaging
   experiments. Hydrodynamic infusion of the polyplexes, however, led to
   very specific localization of the polyplexes to the mouse liver and
   promoted excellent gene expression in vivo.}},

Title = {{Heterogeneous Differentiation of Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells in 3D
   Extracellular Matrix Composites}},
Journal = {{BIORESEARCH OPEN ACCESS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{5}},

Abstract = {{Extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins are structural elements of tissue
   and also potent signaling molecules. Previously, our laboratory showed
   that ECM of 2D coatings can trigger differentiation of bone
   marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into mesodermal lineages in
   an ECM-specific manner over 14 days, in some cases comparable to
   chemical induction. To test whether a similar effect was possible in a
   3D, tissue-like environment, we designed a synthetic-natural biomaterial
   composite. The composite can present whole-molecule ECM proteins to
   cells, even those that do not spontaneously form hydrogels ex vivo, in
   3D. To this end, we entrapped collagen type I, laminin-111, or
   fibronectin in ECM composites with MSCs and directly compared markers of
   mesodermal differentiation including cardiomyogenic (ACTC1), osteogenic
   (SPP1), adipogenic (PPARG), and chondrogenic (SOX9) in 2D versus 3D. We
   found the 3D condition largely mimicked the 2D condition such that the
   addition of type I collagen was the most potent inducer of
   differentiation to all lineages tested. One notable difference between
   2D and 3D was pronounced adipogenic differentiation in 3D especially in
   the presence of exogenous collagen type I. In particular, PPARG gene
   expression was significantly increased approximate to 16-fold relative
   to chemical induction, in 3D and not in 2D. Unexpectedly, 3D engagement
   of ECM proteins also altered immunomodulatory function of MSCs in that
   expression of IL-6 gene was elevated relative to basal levels in 2D. In
   fact, levels of IL-6 gene expression in 3D composites containing
   exogenously supplied collagen type I or fibronectin were statistically
   similar to levels attained in 2D with tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-)
   stimulation and these levels were sustained over a 2-week period. Thus,
   this novel biomaterial platform allowed us to compare the biochemical
   impact of whole-molecule ECM proteins in 2D versus 3D indicating
   enhanced adipogenic differentiation and IL-6 expression of MSC in the 3D
   context. Exploiting the biochemical impact of ECM proteins on MSC
   differentiation and immunomodulation could augment the therapeutic
   utility of MSCs.}},

Abstract = {{We discuss the evolution of catalytic function of interstitial

   specifically, in the context of catalytic deoxygenation reactions. We
   compare and contrast synthesis techniques of molybdenum and tungsten
   carbides, including temperature programmed reaction and ultra-high

   phase-pure materials and that in situ surface modification during
   deoxygenation likely results in the formation of oxycarbides. We surmise
   that catalytic metal-acid bifunctionality of transition metal carbides
   can be tuned via oxygen modification due to the inherent oxophilicity of
   these materials, and we demonstrate the use of in situ chemical
   titration methods to assess catalytic site requirements on these
   formulations.}},

Abstract = {{Earth abundant copper-zinc-tin chalcogenide (CZTSSe) is an emerging
   material for the development of low cost and sustainable thin film solar
   cells (TFSCs). A low cost, green, and up-scalable approach to the
   fabrication of TFSCs through a sputtering process is the main challenge
   to achieve high efficiency for Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)(4) (CZTSSe) solar cells for
   industrialization. Based on a closed isothermal chamber annealing
   system, we could precisely calculate and control the chalcogenide
   partial vapour pressure during the annealing process. We designed,
   developed, and optimized an environmentally friendly strategy to
   synthesise a high quality CZTSSe absorber thin film and to fabricate a
   solar cell without using toxic H2Se and H2S gases as the Se and S
   sources or any other volatile compounds (SnS and Sn), and a chalcogenide
   diffusion barrier layer. We fabricated a CZTSSe TFSC with 9.24\%
   efficiency, which is the highest performance for sputtering processed
   CZTSSe TFSC prepared without using toxic gases and additional processes.
   Based on this green strategy, we also fabricated the integrated
   submodule using CZTSSe absorber layers with efficiencies as high as eta
   = 2.76\% with eight interconnected cells (active area of 22.4 cm(2)).
   Our studies on this green synthesis strategy for CZTSSe solar cells
   could introduce a possible pathway to green fabrication for the low cost
   and highly efficient TFSC industrialization field.}},

Abstract = {{Goal: Sensorimotor-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) have achieved
   successful control of real and virtual devices in up to three
   dimensions; however, the traditional sensor-based paradigm limits the
   intuitive use of these systems. Many control signals for
   state-of-the-art BCIs involve imagining the movement of body parts that
   have little to do with the output command, revealing a cognitive
   disconnection between the user's intent and the action of the end
   effector. Therefore, there is a need to develop techniques that can
   identify with high spatial resolution the self-modulated neural activity
   reflective of the actions of a helpful output device. Methods: We extend
   previous EEG source imaging (ESI) work to decoding natural hand/wrist
   manipulations by applying a novel technique to classifying four complex
   motor imaginations of the right hand: flexion, extension, supination,
   and pronation. Results: We report an increase of up to 18.6\% for
   individual task classification and 12.7\% for overall classification
   using the proposed ESI approach over the traditional sensor-based
   method. Conclusion: ESI is able to enhance BCI performance of decoding
   complex right hand motor imagery tasks. Significance: This study may
   lead to the development of BCI systems with naturalistic and intuitive
   motor imaginations, thus facilitating broad use of noninvasive BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{Goal: Develop and characterize the functionality of a novel thin-film
   probe technology with a higher density of electrode contacts than are
   currently available with commercial deep brain stimulation (DBS) lead
   technology. Such technology has potential to enhance the spatial
   precision of DBS and enable a more robust approach to sensing local
   field potential activity in the context of adaptive DBS strategies.
   Methods: Thin-film planar arrays were microfabricated and then assembled
   on a cylindrical carrier to achieve a lead with 3-D conformation. Using
   an integrated and removable stylet, the arrays were chronically
   implanted in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus in two
   parkinsonian nonhuman primates. Results: This study provides the first
   in vivo data from chronically implanted DBS arrays for translational
   nonhuman primate studies. Stimulation through the arrays induced a
   decrease in parkinsonian rigidity, and directing current around the lead
   showed an orientation dependence for eliciting motor capsule side
   effects. The array recordings also showed that oscillatory activity in
   the basal ganglia is heterogeneous at a smaller scale than detected by
   the current DBS lead technology. Conclusion: These 3-D DBS arrays
   provide an enabling tool for future studies that seek to monitor and
   modulate deep brain activity through chronically implanted leads.
   Significance: DBS lead technology with a higher density of electrode
   contacts has potential to enable sculpting DBS current flow and sensing
   biomarkers of disease and therapy.}},

   Ribosomes}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The explosion of bioinformatics technologies in the form of next
   generation sequencing (NGS) has facilitated a massive influx of genomics
   data in the form of short reads. Short read mapping is therefore a
   fundamental component of next generation sequencing pipelines which
   routinely match these short reads against reference genomes for contig
   assembly. However, such techniques have seldom been applied to microbial
   marker gene sequencing studies, which have mostly relied on novel
   heuristic approaches. We propose NINJA Is Not Just Another OTU-Picking
   Solution (NINJA-OPS, or NINJA for short), a fast and highly accurate
   novel method enabling reference-based marker gene matching (picking
   Operational Taxonomic Units, or OTUs). NINJA takes advantage of the
   Burrows-Wheeler (BW) alignment using an artificial reference chromosome
   composed of concatenated reference sequences, the ``concatesome,{''} as
   the BW input. Other features include automatic support for paired-end
   reads with arbitrary insert sizes. NINJA is also free and open source
   and implements several pre-filtering methods that elicit substantial
   speedup when coupled with existing tools. We applied NINJA to several
   published microbiome studies, obtaining accuracy similar to or better
   than previous reference-based OTU-picking methods while achieving an
   order of magnitude or more speedup and using a fraction of the memory
   footprint. NINJA is a complete pipeline that takes a FASTA-formatted
   input file and outputs a QIIME-formatted taxonomy-annotated BIOM file
   for an entire MiSeq run of human gut microbiome 16S genes in under 10
   minutes on a dual-core laptop.}},

Title = {{Approximating Spectral Densities of Large Matrices}},
Journal = {{SIAM REVIEW}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{58}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{34-65}},
Abstract = {{In physics, it is sometimes desirable to compute the so-called density
   of states (DOS), also known as the spectral density, of a real symmetric
   matrix A. The spectral density can be viewed as a probability density
   distribution that measures the likelihood of finding eigenvalues near
   some point on the real line. The most straightforward way to obtain this
   density is to compute all eigenvalues of A, but this approach is
   generally costly and wasteful, especially for matrices of large
   dimension. There exist alternative methods that allow us to estimate the
   spectral density function at much lower cost. The major computational
   cost of these methods is in multiplying A with a number of vectors,
   which makes them appealing for large-scale problems where products of
   the matrix A with arbitrary vectors are relatively inexpensive. This
   article defines the problem of estimating the spectral density carefully
   and discusses how to measure the accuracy of an approximate spectral
   density. It then surveys a few known methods for estimating the spectral
   density and considers variations of existing methods. All methods are
   discussed from a numerical linear algebra point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Perovskite cobaltites have been studied for years as some of the few
   solids to exhibit thermally driven spin-state crossovers. The
   unanticipated first-order spin and electronic transitions recently
   discovered in Pr-based cobaltites are notably different from these
   conventional crossovers, and are understood in terms of a unique valence
   transition. In essence, the Pr valence is thought to spontaneously shift
   from 3+ toward 4+ on cooling, driving subsequent transitions in Co
   valence and electronic/magnetic properties. Here, we apply
   temperature-dependent transmission electron microscopy and spectroscopy
   to study this phenomenon, for the first time with atomic spatial
   resolution, in the prototypical (Pr0.85Y0.15)(0.70) Ca0.30CoO3-delta. In
   addition to the direct spectroscopic observation of charge transfer
   between Pr and Co at the 165 K transition (on both the Pr and O edges),
   we also find a simultaneous order/disorder transition associated with O
   vacancies. Remarkably, the first-order valence change drives a
   transition between ordered and random O vacancies, at constant O vacancy
   density, demonstrating reversible crystallization of such vacancies even
   at cryogenic temperatures.}},

Title = {{Diffusion and reactivity in ultraviscous aerosol and the correlation
   with particle viscosity}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{1298-1308}},
Abstract = {{The slow transport of water, organic species and oxidants in viscous
   aerosol can lead to aerosol existing in transient states that are not
   solely governed by thermodynamic principles but by the kinetics of
   gas-particle partitioning. The relationship between molecular diffusion
   constants and particle viscosity (for example, as reflected in the
   Stokes-Einstein equation) is frequently considered to provide an
   approximate guide to relate the kinetics of aerosol transformation with
   a material property of the aerosol. We report direct studies of both
   molecular diffusion and viscosity in the aerosol phase for the ternary
   system water/ maleic acid/sucrose, considering the relationship between
   the hygroscopic response associated with the change in water
   partitioning, the volatilisation of maleic acid, the ozonolysis kinetics
   of maleic acid and the particle viscosity. Although water clearly acts
   as a plasticiser, the addition of minor fractions of other organic
   moieties can similarly lead to significant changes in the viscosity from
   that expected for the dominant component forming the organic matrix
   (sucrose). Here we highlight that the Stokes-Einstein relationship
   between the diffusion constant of water and the viscosity of the
   particle may be more than an order of magnitude in error, even at
   viscosities as low as 1 Pa s. We show that the thermodynamic
   relationships of hygroscopic response that underpin such kinetic
   determinations must be accurately known to retrieve accurate values for
   diffusion constants; such data are often not available. Further, we show
   that scaling of the diffusion constants of organic molecules of similar
   size to those forming the matrix with particle viscosity may be well
   represented by the Stokes-Einstein equation, suppressing the apparent
   volatility of semi-volatile components. Finally, the variation in uptake
   coefficients and diffusion constants for oxidants and small weakly
   interacting molecules may be much less dependent on viscosity than the
   diffusion constants of more strongly interacting molecules such as
   water.}},

Title = {{Nanopore sensing at ultra-low concentrations using single-molecule
   dielectrophoretic trapping}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Single-molecule techniques are being developed with the exciting
   prospect of revolutionizing the healthcare industry by generating vast
   amounts of genetic and proteomic data. One exceptionally promising route
   is in the use of nanopore sensors. However, a well-known complexity is
   that detection and capture is predominantly diffusion limited. This
   problem is compounded when taking into account the capture volume of a
   nanopore, typically 10(8)-10(10) times smaller than the sample volume.
   To rectify this disproportionate ratio, we demonstrate a simple, yet
   powerful, method based on coupling single-molecule dielectrophoretic
   trapping to nanopore sensing. We show that DNA can be captured from a
   controllable, but typically much larger, volume and concentrated at the
   tip of a metallic nanopore. This enables the detection of single
   molecules at concentrations as low as 5 fM, which is approximately a
   10(3) reduction in the limit of detection compared with existing
   methods, while still maintaining efficient throughput.}},

Abstract = {{As the pulsatile cardiac blood flow drives the heart valve leaflets to
   open and close, the flow in the vicinity of the valve resembles a pulsed
   jet through a nonaxisymmetric orifice with a dynamically changing area.
   As a result, three-dimensional vortex rings with intricate topology
   emerge that interact with the complex cardiac anatomy and give rise to
   shear layers, regions of recirculation, and flow instabilities that
   could ultimately lead to transition to turbulence. Such complex flow
   patterns, which are inherently valve-and patient-specific, lead to
   mechanical forces at scales that can cause blood cell damage and
   thrombosis, increasing the likelihood of stroke, and can trigger the
   pathogenesis of various life-threatening valvular heart diseases. We
   summarize the current understanding of flow phenomena induced by heart
   valves, discuss their linkage with disease pathways, and emphasize the
   research advances required to translate in-depth understanding of
   valvular hemodynamics into effective patient therapies.}},

Abstract = {{We conduct a combined experimental and computational study to reveal the
   kinetics of tandem glucose isomerization and fructose dehydration to
   5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) over a bifunctional zeolite H-BEA-25 in
   water. The model accounts for multicomponent adsorption, homogeneous
   Bronsted acid catalyzed chemistry of fructose, intrinsic heterogeneous
   Lewis acid catalyzed isomerization, Bronsted acid catalyzed fructose
   dehydration, HMF rehydration, and humin formation chemistry. The
   octahedrally coordinated extra-framework Al sites catalyze glucose to
   fructose isomerization effectively. The activation energy for the
   isomerization in H-BEA-25 is between those reported for Ti-BEA and
   Sn-BEA. We reveal that tandem reactions exhibit multiple kinetic
   regimes. When a bifunctional catalyst with a fixed total number of acid
   sites is used (e.g., aluminosilicate zeolites), the HMF formation rate
   exhibits a volcano type curve vs. the Lewis to Bronsted acid site ratio.
   On the other hand, when the two types of sites are varied independently
   (e.g., in Sn-BEA and HCl), the HMF formation rate increases and then
   approaches a plateau with increasing Bronsted acid site density. These
   appear to be generic features of tandem reactions catalyzed by multiple
   or multifunctional catalysts. We show that materials with stronger sugar
   adsorption would produce HMF in significantly higher yields and higher
   rate than H-BEA. When HMF degradation reactions are suppressed, a ratio
   of Lewis to Bronsted acid sites of similar to 0.3 maximizes the HMF rate
   produced from glucose and the HMF yield (which is predicted to be
   similar to 60\% at 130 degrees C). These predictions provide a framework
   for understanding and improving tandem reactions catalyzed by
   heterogeneous catalysts. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Modern imaging sensors with higher megapixel resolution and frame rates
   are being increasingly used for wide-area video surveillance (VS). This
   has produced an accelerated demand for high-performance implementation
   of VS algorithms for real-time processing of high-resolution videos. The
   emergence of multi-core architectures and graphics processing units
   (GPUs) provides energy and cost-efficient platform to meet the real-time
   processing needs by extracting data level parallelism in such
   algorithms. However, the potential benefits of these architectures can
   only be realized by developing fine-grained parallelization strategies
   and algorithm innovation. This paper describes parallel implementation
   of video object detection algorithms like Gaussians mixture model (GMM)
   for background modelling, morphological operations for post-processing
   and connected component labelling (CCL) for blob labelling. Novel
   parallelization strategies and fine-grained optimization techniques are
   described for fully exploiting the computational capacity of CUDA cores
   on GPUs. Experimental results show parallel GPU implementation achieves
   significant speedups of similar to 250x for binary morphology, similar
   to 15x for GMM and similar to 2x for CCL when compared to sequential
   implementation running on Intel Xeon processor, resulting in processing
   of 22.3 frames per second for HD videos.}},

Abstract = {{The formation and phase evolution of Cu-S based compounds in kesterite
   Cu2ZnSnS4 (CZTS) absorbing thin films is a critical factor affecting the

   However, to the best of our knowledge, few studies have investigated the
   segregation of Cu-S based compounds in kesterite thin films during the
   sulfurization process. In this study, stacked Cu/SnS2/ZnS precursor thin
   films were annealed to systematically study the segregation and phase
   evolution of Cu-S based compounds in kesterite thin films subjected to
   functional sulfurization times at 550 degrees C. The stacked precursor
   thin films appeared to be fully transformed to the pure kesterite phase
   when the sulfurization times are over 30 min. when analyzed using X-ray
   diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. However, transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) characterization revealed that Cu-S based compounds
   segregated in the kesterite CZTS thin films annealed for 120 min at 550
   degrees C. Based on the experimental results obtained for functional
   sulfurization times, a mechanism for Cu-S based compounds segregation
   and the phase evolution process is proposed.}},

Abstract = {{Shape memory polymer (SMP) foams were synthesized with three different
   nanoparticles (tungsten, silicon dioxide, and aluminum oxide) for
   embolization of cerebral aneurysms. Ultra-low density SMP foams have
   previously been utilized for aneurysm occlusion, resulting in a rapid,
   stable thrombus. However, the small cross section of foam struts can
   potentially lead to fracture and particulate generation, which would be
   a serious adverse event for an embolic device. The goal of this study
   was to improve the mechanical properties of the system by physically
   incorporating fillers into the SMP matrix. Thermal and mechanical
   characterization suggested minimal changes in thermal transition of the
   SMP nanocomposites and improved mechanical strength and toughness for
   systems with low filler content. Actuation profiles of the three polymer
   systems were tuned with filler type and content, resulting in faster SMP
   foam actuation for nanocomposites containing higher filler content.
   Additionally, thermal stability of the SMP nanocomposites improved with
   increasing filler concentration, and particulate count remained well
   below accepted standard limits for all systems. Extraction studies
   demonstrated little release of silicon dioxide and aluminum oxide from
   the bulk over 16 days. Tungsten release increased over the 16 day
   examination period, with a maximum measured concentration of
   approximately 2.87 mu g mL(-1). The SMP nanocomposites developed through
   this research have the potential for use in medical devices due to their
   tailorable mechanical properties, thermal resistivity, and actuation
   profiles.}},

Abstract = {{Structural control systems offer an attractive approach to protect civil
   infrastructures from natural hazards such as earthquakes. Wireless
   structural control systems that utilize wireless sensors for sensing,
   communication, and control have drawn increased attention because of the
   flexible installation, rapid deployment, and reduced cost. Although
   there are studies of wireless control systems for civil structures, a
   benchmark problem that captures not only the dynamics of the plant but
   also the realistic features of a wireless network has not been
   available. In this paper, a benchmark model for an active mass driver
   system with a wireless sensor network is presented. This wireless
   control benchmark model combines a seismically excited building
   benchmark model developed with Simulink (Matlab, MathWorks, Inc.,
   Natick, MA, USA) and a wireless sensor network implemented in simulation
   using a state-of-the-art wireless simulator TOSSIM (UC Berkeley,
   Berkeley, CA, USA). Wireless signal and noise traces collected from a
   real-world multistory building are used as inputs to TOSSIM to
   realistically simulate the wireless sensor network. Wireless control
   design issues such as network-induced delay, data loss, available sensor
   measurements, measurement noises, and control constraints can be studied
   with this benchmark model. A sample controller is provided to illustrate
   the wireless control design. Evaluation criteria have been provided to
   examine resources and control performances. Copyright (C) 2015 John

Abstract = {{Forward genetic screens using Sleeping Beauty (SB)-mobilized T2/Onc
   transposons have been used to identify common insertion sites (CISs)
   associated with tumor formation. Recurrent sites of transposon insertion
   are commonly identified using ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR). Here, we
   use RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to directly identify transcriptional
   events mediated by T2/Onc. Surprisingly, the majority (similar to 80\%)
   of LM-PCR identified junction fragments do not lead to observable
   changes in RNA transcripts. However, in CIS regions, direct
   transcriptional effects of transposon insertions are observed. We
   developed an automated method to systematically identify T2/Onc-genome
   RNA fusion sequences in RNAseq data. RNA fusion-based CISs were
   identified corresponding to both DNA-based CISs (Cdkn2a, Mycl1, Nf2,
   Pten, Sema6d, and Rere) and additional regions strongly associated with
   cancer that were not observed by LM-PCR (Myc, Akt1, Pth, Csf1r, Fgfr2,
   Wisp1, Map3k5, and Map4k3). In addition to calculating recurrent CISs,
   we also present complementary methods to identify potential driver
   events via determination of strongly supported fusions and fusions with
   large transcript level changes in the absence of multitumor recurrence.
   These methods independently identify CIS regions and also point to
   cancer-associated genes like Braf. We anticipate RNA-seq analyses of
   tumors from forward genetic screens will become an efficient tool to
   identify causal events.}},

Abstract = {{Variations in properties, active behavior, injury, scarring, and/or
   disease can all cause a tissue's mechanical behavior to be
   heterogeneous. Advances in imaging technology allow for accurate
   full-field displacement tracking of both in vitro and in vivo
   deformation from an applied load. While detailed strain fields provide
   some insight into tissue behavior, material properties are usually
   determined by fitting stress-strain behavior with a constitutive
   equation. However, the determination of the mechanical behavior of
   heterogeneous soft tissue requires a spatially varying constitutive
   equation (i.e., one in which the material parameters vary with
   position). We present an approach that computationally dissects the
   sample domain into many homogeneous subdomains, wherein subdomain
   boundaries are formed by applying a betweenness based graphical analysis
   to the deformation gradient field to identify locations with large
   discontinuities. This novel partitioning technique successfully
   determined the shape, size and location of regions with locally similar
   material properties for: (1) a series of simulated soft tissue samples
   prescribed with both abrupt and gradual changes in anisotropy strength,
   prescribed fiber alignment, stiffness, and nonlinearity, (2) Tissue
   analogs (PDMS and collagen gels) which were tested biaxially and speckle
   tracked (3) and soft tissues which exhibited a natural variation in
   properties (cadaveric supraspinatus tendon), a pathologic variation in
   properties (thoracic aorta containing transmural plaque), and active
   behavior (contracting cardiac sheet). The routine enables the dissection
   of samples computationally rather than physically, allowing for the
   study of small tissues specimens with unknown and irregular
   inhomogeneity.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a high-throughput screening assay that allows for relative
   comparison of the twitch force of millimeter-scale gel-based cardiac
   tissues. This assay is based on principles taken from traction force
   microscopy and uses fluorescent microspheres embedded in a soft
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate. A gel-forming cell suspension is
   simply pipetted onto the PDMS to form hemispherical cardiac tissue
   samples. Recordings of the fluorescent bead movement during tissue
   pacing are used to determine the maximum distance that the tissue can
   displace the elastic PDMS substrate. In this study, fibrin gel
   hemispheres containing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived
   cardiomyocytes were formed on the PDMS and allowed to culture for 9
   days. Bead displacement values were measured and compared to direct
   force measurements to validate the utility of the system. The amplitude
   of bead displacement correlated with direct force measurements, and the
   twitch force generated by the tissues was the same in 2 and 4mg/mL
   fibrin gels, even though the 2mg/mL samples visually appear more
   contractile if the assessment were made on free-floating samples. These
   results demonstrate the usefulness of this assay as a screening tool
   that allows for rapid sample preparation, data collection, and analysis

Title = {{Clustering of elderly patient subgroups to identify medication-related
   readmission risks}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{85}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{43-52}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: High Risk Medication Regimen (HRMR) scores are weakly
   predictive of hospital readmissions for elderly home health care
   patients. HRMR is composed of three elements related to drug risks:
   polypharmacy (number of medications); Potentially Inappropriate
   Medications (PIM) known to be harmful to the elderly; and the Medication
   Regimen Complexity Index (MRCI) that weighs drugs by the complexity of
   their dosing and instructions. In this paper, we hypothesized that HRMR
   scores are more predictive for demographic subgroups of elderly
   patients. The study used Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS)
   variables to identify subgroups of patients for whom the HRMR measures
   appeared more predictive for hospital readmissions.
   Methods: OASIS and medication data were reused from a study of 911
   patients (355 males, 556 females; mean age 78.9) from 15
   Medicare-certified home health care agencies that established the
   relationship between HRMR and hospital readmissions. Hierarchical
   agglomerative clustering using the Jaccard distance measure and
   average-link method identified patient subgroups based on the OASIS
   data. Receiver operating curve (ROC) analyses evaluated the predictive
   strength of the HRMR variables for each subgroup. Additional False
   Discovery Rate (FDR) analyses assessed whether the clustered
   relationships were chance.
   Results: Clustering of OASIS data for 911 patients identified six
   subgroups: patients with Good Functional Status (n = 382); Females with
   Moderate to Severe Pain (n = 354); patients with poor prognosis needing
   functional status assistance (n = 419); patients with Poor Functional
   Status (n = 287); Males with Adult Children as Caregiver (n = 198);
   adults living alone with spouses as primary caregiver (n = 127). ROC
   results relating these subgroups to HRMR risks were strongest for Males
   with Adult Children as Caregivers (AUC: polypharmacy, 0.73; PIM, 0.64;
   MRCI, 0.77). The findings for this subgroup also met the FDR analysis
   threshold (< = 0.20).
   Conclusions: A risk of medication-related readmissions in elderly men
   with adult children as caregivers is consistent with research showing
   problems in medication adherence when seniors are supported by informal
   caregivers. The results from clustering analysis present a hypothesis
   for research on HRMR and on the relationship between adult caregivers
   and their fathers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Star-shaped block copolymers based on poly(D, L-lactide- co-glycolide)
   (PLGA) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) (st-PLGA-PEG) were synthesized

   relationship between the arm numbers of st-PLGA-PEG copolymers and their
   micelle properties. st-PLGA-PEG copolymers with arm numbers 3, 4 and 6
   were synthesized by using different cores such as trimethylolpropane,
   pentaerythritol and dipentaerythritol, and were characterized by nuclear
   magnetic resonance and gel permeation chromatography. The critical
   micelle concentration decreased with increasing arm numbers in
   st-PLGA-PEG copolymers. The doxorubicin-loaded st-PLGA-PEG micelles were
   prepared by a modified nanoprecipitation method. Micellar properties
   such as particle size, drug loading content and in vitro drug release
   behavior were investigated as a function of the number of arms and
   compared with each other. The doxorubicin-loaded 4-arm PLGA-PEG micelles
   were found to have the highest cellular uptake efficiency and
   cytotoxicity compared with 3-arm PLGA-PEG micelles and 6-arm PLGA-PEG
   micelles. The results suggest that structural tailoring of arm numbers
   from st-PLGA-PEG copolymers could provide a new strategy for designing
   drug carriers of high efficiency.}},

Abstract = {{Reaction kinetics and pathways of p-xylene formation from
   2,5-dimethylfuran (DMF) and ethylene via cascade reactions of
   Diels-Alder cycloaddition and subsequent dehydration over H-BEA zeolite
   (Si/Al = 12.5) were characterized. Two distinct kinetic regimes were
   discovered corresponding to the rate limiting reaction, namely
   Diels-Alder cycloaddition and cycloadduct dehydration, as the
   concentration of Bronsted acid sites decreases. At catalyst loadings
   with effective acid site concentrations exceeding a critical value
   (similar to 2.0 mM), the rate of formation of Diels-Alder products
   becomes constant. Under these conditions, the measured activation energy
   of 17.7 +/- 1.4 kcal mol(-1) and reaction orders correspond to the {[}4
   + 2] Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction of DMF and ethylene. Conversely,
   at catalyst loadings below the critical value, the formation rate of
   p-xylene becomes first order in catalyst loading, and the measured
   activation energy of 11.3 +/- 3.5 kcal mol(-1) is consistent with
   dehydration of the Diels-Alder cycloadduct to p-xylene. Experimental
   comparison between H-BEA and H-Y zeolite catalysts at identical
   conditions indicates that the micropore structure controls side
   reactions such as furan dimerization and hydrolysis; the latter is
   supported via molecular simulation revealing a substantially higher
   loading of DMF within H-Y than within H-BEA zeolites at reaction
   conditions.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Auto-venting turbines have been proposed as a promising solution to the
   problem of low oxygen content in the discharged downstream water of an
   electric power plant. The current design of these turbines relies
   primarily on computational simulation. The experimental studies that
   focus on the physical processes occurring in turbulent bubbly wake are
   urgently needed to improve the performance of these simulations in
   predicting the bubble size distribution behind auto-venting turbines.
   Therefore, in the current study, we conducted detailed experimental
   investigations into the bubble size distributions in the wake of a
   ventilated hydrofoil. The mean bubble statistics is measured at
   different liquid velocities and air entrainment rates, and then the
   variation in mean bubble statistics is studied at different downstream
   locations in the wake. The bubble size distributions at different
   downstream locations have revealed the presence of distinct
   coalescence-dominant and breakup-dominant regimes. Analytical
   expressions are derived for the prediction of maximum stable diameter
   and Sauter mean diameter of bubbles, in the breakup and coalescence
   regimes, respectively. The observations from high speed imaging provide
   support for the measurements of bubble statistics, and physical insights
   into different mechanisms of bubble breakup and coalescence in turbulent
   wake. It is hoped that these insights will aid in developing generic
   model of bubble size distribution, and will help researchers improve
   bubbly flow simulations for auto-venting turbines. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   behaved as p-MOSFETs with peak extrinsic transconductance, gm, of 282 mu
   S/mu m at V-DS = -2 V. After passivation, the same devices displayed the
   ambipolar behavior, and when tested as n-MOSFETs, had peak g(m) = 66 mu
   S/mu m at V-DS = +2 V, and similar devices on the same wafer had gm as
   high as 80 mu S/mu m. These results are an important step toward the

Abstract = {{Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like 3
   (APOBEC3; A3) DNA cytosine deaminases can be incorporated into progeny
   virions and inhibit lentiviral replication. On the other hand, viral
   infectivity factor (Vif) of lentiviruses antagonizes A3-mediated
   antiviral activities by degrading A3 proteins. It is known that domestic
   cat (Felis catus) APOBEC3Z3 (A3Z3), the ortholog of human APOBEC3H,
   potently suppresses the infectivity of vif-defective feline
   immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Although a recent report has shown that
   domestic cat encodes 7 haplotypes (hap I to hap VII) of A3Z3, the
   relevance of A3Z3 polymorphism in domestic cats with FIV Vif has not yet
   been addressed. In this study, we demonstrated that these feline A3Z3
   variants suppress vif-defective FIV infectivity. We also revealed that
   codon 65 of feline A3Z3 is a positively selected site and that A3Z3 hap
   V is subject to positive selection during evolution. It is particularly
   noteworthy that feline A3Z3 hap V is resistant to FIV Vif-mediated
   degradation and still inhibits vif-proficient viral infection. Moreover,
   the side chain size, but not the hydrophobicity, of the amino acid at
   position 65 determines the resistance to FIV Vif-mediated degradation.
   Furthermore, phylogenetic analyses have led to the inference that feline
   A3Z3 hap V emerged approximately 60,000 years ago. Taken together, these
   findings suggest that feline A3Z3 hap V may have been selected for
   escape from an ancestral FIV. This is the first evidence for an
   evolutionary ``arms race{''} between the domestic cat and its cognate
   lentivirus.
   IMPORTANCE
   Gene diversity and selective pressure are intriguing topics in the field
   of evolutionary biology. A direct interaction between a cellular protein
   and a viral protein can precipitate an evolutionary arms race between
   host and virus. One example is primate APOBEC3G, which potently
   restricts the replication of primate lentiviruses (e.g., human
   immunodeficiency virus type 1 {[}HIV-1] and simian immunodeficiency
   virus {[}SIV]) if its activity is not counteracted by the viral Vif
   protein. Here we investigate the ability of 7 naturally occurring
   variants of feline APOBEC3, APOBEC3Z3 (A3Z3), to inhibit FIV
   replication. Interestingly, one feline A3Z3 variant is dominant,
   restrictive, and naturally resistant to FIV Vif-mediated degradation.
   Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the ancestral change that generated
   this variant could have been caused by positive Darwinian selection,
   presumably due to an ancestral FIV infection. The
   experimental-phylogenetic investigation sheds light on the evolutionary
   history of the domestic cat, which was likely influenced by lentiviral
   infection.}},

   lamellar-disorder transition at compositions adjacent to the
   microemulsion channel, the interfacial area per chain of the B mu E
   approaches that of the neat (undiluted) lamellar diblock copolymer. With
   increasing temperature, the diblock-rich interface swells through
   homopolymer infiltration. Time-temperature-superposed linear dynamic
   data obtained as a function of frequency show that the viscoelastic
   response of the B mu E is strikingly similar to that of the fluctuating
   pure diblock copolymer in the disordered state, which we associate with
   membrane undulations and the breaking and reforming of interfaces. This
   work provides new insights into the structure and dynamics that
   characterize thermodynamically stable B mu Es in the limits of
   relatively weak and strong segregation.}},

Abstract = {{This study focuses on thermomechanical effects in cryopreservation
   associated with a novel approach of volumetric heating by means on
   nanoparticles in an alternating electromagnetic field. This approach is
   studied for the application of cryopreservation by vitrification, where
   the crystalline phase is completely avoided-the cornerstone of
   cryoinjury. Vitrification can be achieved by quickly cooling the
   material to cryogenic storage, where ice cannot form. Vitrification can
   be maintained at the end of the cryogenic protocol by quickly rewarming
   the material back to room temperature. The magnitude of the rewarming
   rates necessary to maintain vitrification is much higher than the
   magnitude of the cooling rates that are required to achieve it in the
   first place. The most common approach to achieve the required cooling
   and rewarming rates is by exposing the specimen's surface to a
   temperature-controlled environment. Due to the underlying principles of
   heat transfer, there is a size limit in the case of surface heating
   beyond which crystallization cannot be prevented at the center of the
   specimen. Furthermore, due to the underlying principles of solid
   mechanics, there is a size limit beyond which thermal expansion in the
   specimen can lead to structural damage and fractures. Volumetric heating
   during the rewarming phase of the cryogenic protocol can alleviate these
   size limitations. This study suggests that volumetric heating can reduce
   thermomechanical stress, when combined with an appropriate design of the
   thermal protocol. Without such design, this study suggests that the
   level of stress may still lead to structural damage even when volumetric
   heating is applied. This study proposes strategies to harness
   nanoparticles heating in order to reduce thermomechanical stress in
   cryopreservation by vitrification.}},

Abstract = {{A method for estimating gait parameters (shank, thigh, and stance leg

   probable gait progression by minimization of a cost function that
   reflects the size of errors in the gait parameters. In addition, a model
   for gait patterns that takes into account their variations due to
   walking speed is introduced and used. The approach is tested on data

   angles with errors less than 6 deg (one standard deviation) and, thus,
   is suitable for many envisioned gait monitoring applications in

Abstract = {{The effect of solvent selectivity on the micelle structure formed by a
   poly(styrene-b-ethylene-alt-propylene) diblock copolymer (PS-PEP, M-PS =
   42,000 g/mol and M-PEP = 62,000 g/mol) in solutions of squalane, a
   highly selective solvent for the PEP block, and 1-phenyldodecane, a
   neutral solvent, is investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS)
   and small-angle Xray scattering (SAXS). The results reveal that addition
   of 1-phenyldodecane systematically reduces solvent selectivity, leading
   to decreases in the critical micelle temperature (T-CMT) and the average
   number of chains in a micelle (N-agg), and an increase in the solvent
   fraction in the core. However, the core blocks have essentially
   unperturbed dimensions (i.e., R-c approximate to 2 x < R-g >(o), where <
   R-g >(o) is unperturbed radius of gyration of the core block), and
   therefore the micelle core radius (R-c) is nearly independent of solvent
   selectivity, which has not been anticipated by previous theoretical
   descriptions. These results demonstrate that under such conditions,
   excluded volume effects in the corona blocks play the dominant role in
   determining micelle structure. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{The elevated plus maze (EPM) is used to assess anxiety in rodents.
   Beam-walking tasks are used to assess vestibulomotor function. Brain
   injury in rodents can disrupt performance on both of these tasks.
   Developing novel paradigms that integrate tasks like these can reduce
   the need for multiple tests when attempting to assess multiple behaviors
   in the same animal. Using adult male rats, we evaluated the use of a
   modified beam-walking (MBW) apparatus as a surrogate indicator for
   anxiety. We used a model of blast-induced traumatic brain injury (bTBI).
   A total of 39 rats were assessed before and at 3, 6, 24, 72, and 168 h
   either post- bTBI (n=33) or no-injury (n=6) using both EPM and MBW. A
   novel anxiety index was calculated that encompassed peeks and
   re-emergences on MBW. The proposed MBW anxiety index was compared with
   the standard anxiety index calculated from exploration into different
   sections of EPM. Post- bTBI, rats had an increased anxiety index when
   measured using EPM. Similarly, they peeked or fully emerged less out of
   the safe box on MBW. It was found that this novel MBW anxiety index
   captured similar aspects of behavior when compared to the standard
   anxiety index obtained from EPM. Further, these effects were dissociated
   from the effects of bTBI on motor function simultaneously measured on
   MBW. Over the course of 168 h post-bTBI, rats gradually recovered on
   both EPM and MBW. The MBW apparatus succeeded at capturing and
   dissociating two separate facets of rat behavior, motor function and
   anxiety, simultaneously. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Scum is an oily waste stream of the wastewater treatment process that
   can be used to produce biodiesel. Combining acid hydrolysis and solvent
   extraction, a free fatty acid and acyl-glycerol rich product was
   produced. Free fatty acids (FFAs) present were converted to acyl-glycols
   via a high temperature (238 degrees C) glycerin esterification process
   known as glycerolysis. The inorganic catalysts zinc aluminum oxide and
   sodium sulfate were tested during glycerolysis to compare the reaction
   kinetics of converting FFA to acyl-glycerols. It was concluded that the
   zinc-based catalyst increased the reaction rate significantly, from a
   ``k{''} value of 2.57 (uncatalyzed) to 5.63, completing the reaction in
   60 min, half the time it took the uncatalyzed reaction (120 min). Sodium
   sulfate's presence however slowed the reaction, resulting in a ``k{''}
   value of 1.45, completing the reaction in 180 min. Use of the external
   catalyst Zn-Al2O3 showed the greatest catalytic potential, but also
   assumes additional costs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Many mammalian cell lines used in the manufacturing of
   biopharmaceuticals exhibit high glycolytic flux predominantly channeled
   to the production of lactate. The accumulation of lactate in culture
   reduces cell viability and may also decrease product quality. In this
   work, we engineered a HEK 293 derived cell line producing a recombinant
   gene therapy retroviral vector, by down-regulating hypoxia inducible
   factor 1 (HIF1) and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK). Specific
   productivity of infectious viral titers could be increased more than
   20-fold for single gene knock-down (HIF1 or PDK) and more than 30-fold
   under combined down-regulation. Lactate production was reduced up to
   4-fold. However, the reduction in lactate production, alone, was not
   sufficient to enhance the titer: high-titer clones also showed
   significant enrolment of metabolic routes not related to lactate
   production. Transcriptome analysis indicated activation of biological
   amines metabolism, detoxification routes, including glutathione
   metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, glycogen biosynthesis and amino
   acid catabolism. The latter were validated by enzyme activity assays and
   metabolite profiling, respectively. High-titer clones also presented
   substantially increased transcript levels of the viral genes expression
   cassettes. The results herein presented demonstrate the impact of HIF1
   and PDK down-regulation on the production performance of a mammalian
   cell line, reporting one of the highest fold-increase in specific
   productivity of infectious virus titers achieved by metabolic
   engineering. They additionally highlight the contribution of secondary
   pathways, beyond those related to lactate production, that can be also
   explored to pursue improved metabolic status favoring a high-producing
   phenotype. Biotechnol. Bioeng. 2016;113: 150-162. (c) 2015 Wiley

Title = {{Covariance based point cloud descriptors for object detection and

Journal = {{COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING}},
Year = {{2016}},

Pages = {{80-93}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Processing 3D point cloud data is of primary interest in many areas of
   computer vision, including object grasping, robot navigation, and object
   recognition. The introduction of affordable RGB-D sensors has created a
   great interest in the computer vision community towards developing
   efficient algorithms for point cloud processing. Previously, capturing a
   point cloud required expensive specialized sensors such as lasers or
   dedicated range imaging devices; now, range data is readily available
   from low-cost sensors that provide easily extractable point clouds from
   a depth map. From here, an interesting challenge is to find different
   objects in the point cloud. Various descriptors have been introduced to
   match features in a point cloud. Cheap sensors are not necessarily
   designed to produce precise measurements, which means that the data is
   not as accurate as a point cloud provided from a laser or a dedicated
   range finder. Although some feature descriptors have been shown to be
   successful in recognizing objects from point clouds, there still exists
   opportunities for improvement. The aim of this paper is to introduce
   techniques from other fields, such as image processing, into 3D point
   cloud processing in order to improve rendering, classification, and
   recognition. Covariances have proven to be a success not only in image
   processing, but in other domains as well. This work develops the
   application of covariances in conjunction with 3D point cloud data. (C)

Abstract = {{We are interested in a low-rank matrix factorization problem where one
   of the matrix factors has a special structure; specifically, its columns
   live in the unit simplex. This problem finds applications in diverse
   areas such as hyperspectral unmixing, video summarization, spectrum
   sensing, and blind speech separation. Prior works showed that such a
   factorization problem can be formulated as a self-dictionary sparse
   optimization problem under some assumptions that are considered
   realistic in many applications, and convex mixed norms were employed as
   optimization surrogates to realize the factorization in practice.
   Numerical results have shown that the mixed-norm approach demonstrates
   promising performance. In this letter, we conduct performance analysis
   of the mixed-norm approach under noise perturbations. Our result shows
   that using a convex mixed norm can indeed yield provably good solutions.
   More importantly, we also show that using nonconvex mixed (quasi) norms
   is more advantageous in terms of robustness against noise.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an integrated simulation and data envelopment

   capture the main factors which have negatively affects the patients'

   any interruption in ICU's routine functions and being able to convince
   the hospital's principals about the project's outcomes, a simulation
   model is developed and run for different scenarios. Then DEA is used to
   compare the outputs of different scenarios. These scenarios are
   generated by observing the effects of various parameters such as
   lengthening or shortening treatment times, decreasing or increasing
   patient volumes and removing or adding staff members. As the best of our
   knowledge, this is the first study that presents an integrated approach
   based on computer simulation and DEA to concurrently incorporate the
   stated factors and parameters for optimization of complex ICUs in
   developing countries. Therefore, the results of this study are more
   precise and reliable than previous studies because of concurrent
   consideration of the stated factors. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Heat transfer and pressure drop characteristics of micro pin fin arrays
   in a narrow rectangular channel with an air through flow are studied
   with different flow rates ranging from laminar to turbulent flow. Copper
   micro pin fins 150-400 mu m long and 75-700 mu m in diameter are
   fabricated by microfabrication techniques. Performance ratios that
   compare heat transfer to pressure drop characteristics are evaluated to
   investigate performance of the micro pin-fin surfaces when both heat
   transfer and pressure drop are important. The results indicate that
   fluid dynamic effects generated around micro pin fins take a more
   dominant role for heat transfer enhancement than the area increase due
   to micro pin fins. A maximum heat transfer enhancement of 79\% over
   plain surface is achieved due to a micro pin-fin surface with a height
   of 250 mu m and a diameter of 400 mu m. It is expected that the micro
   pin-fin surfaces can be used for improving cooling performance of
   fan-assisted heat sinks for electronics thermal management. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A mesoscopic scale timestep adjustable non-dimensional lattice Boltzmann
   method (NDLBM) for fluid flow and heat transfer with solid-liquid phase
   change is developed using a scaling analysis based on the mesoscopic
   length and velocity scales. The interface between fluid and solid is
   treated as a mixture domain with transient porosity distributions and
   thickness. Timesteps are adjusted by using a transient mesoscopic Mach
   number independent of mesh size to speed up the computation. The code is
   validated by comparison of transient Nusselt numbers, isotherms,
   streamlines, and porosity with prior studies of natural convection in a
   square enclosure with and without phase change material. A benchmark
   problem is proposed to obtain the same equilibrium state for both
   melting and solidification procedures. Full maps of the flow and heat
   transfer patterns for both melting and solidification are presented
   based on the key dimensionless governing parameters. The effects of
   Mach, Stefan (0.01-10), Rayleigh (10(3)-10(8)), and Prandtl (0.1-10)

Abstract = {{Ultrafiltration techniques (pore size of membrane below 100 nm) are
   widely used in chemical engineering, semiconductor, pharmaceutical, food
   and beverage industries. However, for small particles, which are more
   and more attracting interests, the pore size often does not correlate
   well with sieving characteristics of the ultra-membranes. This may cause
   serious issues during modeling and prediction of retention efficiencies.
   Herein, a series of liquid filtration experiments with unfavorable
   conditions were performed. PTFE membranes (50, 100 nm) and Nuclepore
   filters (50, 400 nm) were challenged with 1.7 nm manganese doped ZnS and
   6.6 nm ZnO quantum dots (QDs), 12.4, 34.4 and 50 nm Au and 150 nm SiO2
   nanoparticles. For larger and medium sized particles, sieving and
   eventually pore blockage phenomena were observed. In comparison, for
   small QDs, a high initial retention efficiency (> 0.4) in both filters
   was monitored, followed by a reduced efficiency with ongoing particle
   loading. This high initial retention of small nanoparticles was
   attributed to diffusion deposition rather than to sieving since the
   ratio of pore size to particle size was significantly high (up to 58).
   Our experimental results allow a basic understanding of the deposition
   mechanism of small nanoparticles (diffusion vs. sieving) in different
   filter structures. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We present Visualization-by-Sketching, a direct-manipulation user
   interface for designing new data visualizations. The goals are twofold:
   First, make the process of creating real, animated, data-driven
   visualizations of complex information more accessible to artists,
   graphic designers, and other visual experts with traditional,
   non-technical training. Second, support and enhance the role of human
   creativity in visualization design, enabling visual experimentation and
   workflows similar to what is possible with traditional artistic media.
   The approach is to conceive of visualization design as a combination of
   processes that are already closely linked with visual creativity:
   sketching, digital painting, image editing, and reacting to exemplars.
   Rather than studying and tweaking low-level algorithms and their
   parameters. designers create new visualizations by painting directly on
   top of a digital data canvas, sketching data glyphs, and arranging and
   blending together multiple layers of animated 2D graphics. This requires
   new algorithms and techniques to interpret painterly user input relative
   to data ``under{''} the canvas, balance artistic freedom with the need
   to produce accurate data visualizations, and interactively explore large
   (e.g., terabyte-sized) multivariate datasets. Results demonstrate a
   variety of multivariate data visualization techniques can be rapidly
   recreated using the interface. More importantly, results and feedback
   from artists support the potential for interfaces in this style to
   attract new, creative users to the challenging task of designing more
   effective data visualizations and to help these users stay ``in the
   creative zone{''} as they work.}},

Abstract = {{Diels-Alder cycloaddition of biomass-derived 2-methylfuran and ethylene
   provides a thermochemical pathway to renewable toluene. In this work,
   the kinetics and reaction pathways of toluene formation have been
   evaluated with H-BEA and Sn-BEA catalysts. Kinetic analysis of the main
   reaction chemistries reveals the existence of two rate-controlling
   reactions: (i) Diels-Alder cycloaddition of 2-methylfuran and ethylene
   where the production rate is independent of the Bronsted acid site
   concentration, and (ii) dehydration of the Diels-Alder cycloadduct where
   the production rate is dependent on the Bronsted acid site
   concentration. Application of a reduced kinetic model supports the
   interplay of these two regimes with the highest concentration of toluene
   measured at a catalyst loading equal to the transition region between
   the two kinetic regimes. Selectivity to toluene never exceeded 46\%, as
   2-methylfuran was consumed by several newly identified reactions to side
   products, including dimerization of 2-methylfuran, the formation of a
   trimer following hydrolysis and ring-opening of 2-methylfuran, and the
   incomplete dehydration of the Diels-Alder cycloadduct of 2-methylfuran
   and ethylene. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Cost-efficient entrapment of beta-glucosidase in nanoscale latex and

Journal = {{FOOD CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{190}},
Pages = {{1078-1085}},

Abstract = {{beta-Glucosidase is an ubiquitous enzyme which has enormous
   biotechnological applications. Its deficiency in natural enzyme
   preparations is often overcome by exogenous supplementation, which
   further increases the enzyme utilization cost. Enzyme immobilization
   offers a potential solution through enzyme recycling and easy recovery.
   In the present work Aspergillus niger beta-glucosidase is immobilized
   within nanoscale polymeric materials (polyurethane, latex and silicone),
   through entrapment, and subsequently coated onto a fibrous support.
   Highest apparent activity (90 U g(-1) polymer) was observed with latex,
   while highest entrapment efficiency (93\%) was observed for the silicone
   matrix. Immobilization resulted in the thermo-stabilization of the
   beta-glucosidase with an increase in optimum temperature and activation
   energy for cellobiose hydrolysis. Supplementation to cellulases also
   resulted in an increased cellulose hydrolysis, while retaining more than
   70\% functional stability. Hence, the current study describes novel
   preparations of immobilized beta-glucosidase as highly stable and active
   catalysts for industrial food- and bio-processing applications. (C) 2015

Journal = {{IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN QUANTUM ELECTRONICS}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{22}},

Abstract = {{Effort to improve the bulk heterojunction organic solar cells'
   absorption efficiency utilizes tandem structures combining low- and
   high-bandgap absorbing polymers so that a broader spectrum of sunlight's
   energy can be used for the photon-to-electron conversion and the
   thermalization loss of photon energy can be reduced. However, at the
   intersection of the upper energy level of the high-bandgap polymer and
   the lower energy level of the low-bandgap polymer, photon absorption
   efficiency remains low due to the destructive interference of these
   energy states at the band edges. In order to circumvent this issue, we
   theoretically propose using dielectric fiber arrays to generate lensing
   effects atop of a thin-film polymer/organic tandem solar cell (OTSC),
   aiming to enhance its optical absorption efficiency. Dielectric fibers
   have been calibrated to generate the optimal antireflection coating
   resulting in an integrated absorption enhancement up to 11\% compared to
   its flat-OTSC counterpart. The overall integrated AM1.5 G (air mass 1.5
   global simulated solar spectra) absorption yields absorption
   efficiencies of 83\% in an optimal configuration, with a cell size of
   600 nm and fiber radius of 150 nm. By using fibers as focusing
   lenses/antireflectors, we demonstrate that there exists zero reflection
   at multiple visible frequencies, leading to a relative broadband
   absorption of an ultrathin substrate.}},

Abstract = {{The complexation of poly(dimethylaminoethyl
   methacrylate)-block-poly(styrene) micelles with poly(styrenesulfonate)
   homopolymers was investigated in aqueous buffer at pH 4.5 as a function
   of ionic strength. The complexation process was monitored by
   turbidimetric titration, and the structure and stability of the
   complexes were assessed by dynamic light scattering (DLS), cryogenic
   transmission electron microscopy (cryoTEM), and small-angle X-ray
   scattering. When complexes were formed by slow titration of one
   polyelectrolyte solution into the other, soluble complexes could be
   formed with either polyelectrolyte in excess as long as the mixture did
   not pass through the charge-neutral point. The initial complexes
   exhibited bimodal size distributions by DLS, with one population similar
   in size to or slightly smaller than the bare micelles, and the other
   significantly larger. The former correspond to individual micelles with
   complexed polyelectrolytes leading to a contracted corona; the latter
   reflect multimicelle aggregates that were directly observed by cryoTEM.
   At low ionic strength (e.g., 10 mM), these aggregates were stable on
   weeks-to-months time scales, but at high ionic strength (e.g., 500 mM),
   the aggregates rapidly annealed toward structures whose size and
   solubility depended on which polyelectrolyte was present in excess.
   These results are discussed in terms of the kinetics and thermodynamics
   of the polyelectrolyte complexation process and allow a detailed
   description of the interplay between kinetic and thermodynamic factors
   in this system. This work will inform design of polyelectrolyte
   complexes with tunable structure and stability for future applications.}},

Abstract = {{In order to minimize coke yield during biomass catalytic fast pyrolysis
   (CFP) process, ethylene diamine tetraacetie acid (EDTA) chemical
   modification method is carried out to selectively remove the external
   framework aluminum of HZSM-5 catalyst. X-ray diffraction (XRD), nitrogen
   (N2)-adsorption and ammonia-temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD)
   techniques are employed to investigate the porosity and acidity
   characteristics of original and modified HZSM-5 samples. Py-GC/MS and
   thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) experiments are further conducted to
   explore the catalytic effect of modified HZSM-5 samples on biomass CFP
   and to verify the positive effect on coke reduction. Results show that
   EDTA treatment does not damage the crystal structure of HZSM-5 zeolites,
   but leads to a slight increase of pore volume and pore size. Meanwhile,
   the elimination of the strong acid peak indicates the dealumination of
   outer surface of HZSM-5 zeolites. Treatment time of 2 h (labeled
   EDTA-2H) is optimal for acid removal and hydrocarbon formation. Among
   all modified catalysts, EDTA-2H performs the best for deacidification
   and can obviously increase the yields of positive chemical compositions
   in pyrolysis products. Besides, EDTA modification can improve the
   anti-coking properties of HZSM-5 zeolites, and EDTA-2H gives rise to the
   lowest coke yield. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes Travel Prediction-based Data forwarding (TPD),
   tailored and optimized for multihop vehicle-to-vehicle communications.
   The previous schemes forward data packets mostly utilizing statistical
   information about road network traffic, which becomes much less accurate
   when vehicles travel in a light-traffic vehicular network. In this
   light-traffic vehicular network, highly dynamic vehicle mobility can
   introduce a large variance for the traffic statistics used in the data
   forwarding process. However, with the popularity of GPS navigation
   systems, vehicle trajectories become available and can be utilized to
   significantly reduce this uncertainty in the road traffic statistics.
   Our TPD takes advantage of these vehicle trajectories for a better data
   forwarding in light-traffic vehicular networks. Our idea is that with
   the trajectory information of vehicles in a target road network, a
   vehicle encounter graph is constructed to predict vehicle encounter
   events (i.e., timing for two vehicles to exchange data packets in
   communication range). With this encounter graph, TPD optimizes data
   forwarding process for minimal data delivery delay under a specific
   delivery ratio threshold. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate
   that our TPD significantly outperforms existing legacy schemes in a
   variety of road network settings. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Self-assembled conjugated Molecular wires containing thiophene up to 6
   nm in length were grown layer-by-layer using click chemistry.
   Reflection-absorption infrared spectroscopy, ellipsometry and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy were used to follow the stepwise growth. The
   electronic structure of the conjugated wires was Studied with cyclic
   voltammetry and UV-vis spectroscopy as well as computationally with
   density functional theory (DFT). The current-voltage curves (+/-1 V) of
   the conjugated molecular wires were measured with conducting probe
   atomic force microscopy (CP-AFM) in which the molecular wire film bound
   to a gold substrate was contacted with a conductive AFM probe. By
   systematically measuring the low bias junction resistance as a function
   of length for molecules 1-4 urn long, we extracted the structure
   dependent tunneling attenuation factor (beta) of 3.4 nm(-1) and a
   contact resistance of 220 k Omega. The crossover from tunneling to
   hopping transport was observed at a molecular length of 4-5 nm with an
   activation energy of 0.35 eV extracted from Arrhenius plots of
   resistance versus temperature. DFT calculations revealed localizations
   of spin densities (polarons) on molecular wire radical cations. The
   calculations were employed to gauge transition state energies for
   hopping of polarons along wire segments. Individual estimated transition
   state energies Were 0.2-0.4 eV, in good agreement with the experimental
   activation energy. The transition states correspond to flattening of
   dihedral angles about specific imine bonds. These results open up
   possibilities to further explore the influence of molecular architecture
   on hopping transport in molecular junctions, and highlight the utility
   of DFT to understand charge localization and associated hopping-based
   transport.}},

Abstract = {{Erasure-correcting codes, which support local repair of codeword
   symbols, have attracted substantial attention recently for their
   application in distributed storage systems. This paper investigates a
   generalization of the usual locally repairable codes. In particular,
   this paper studies a class of codes with the following property: any
   small set of codeword symbols can be reconstructed (repaired) from a
   small number of other symbols. This is referred to as cooperative local
   repair. The main contribution of this paper is bounds on the trade-off
   of the minimum distance and the dimension of such codes, as well as
   explicit constructions of families of codes that enable cooperative
   local repair. Some other results regarding cooperative local repair are
   also presented, including an analysis for the well-known
   Hadamard/Simplex codes.}},

Abstract = {{Membranes consisting of ultrathin, oriented, single-wall carbon nanotube
   (SWCNT) micropores with a diameter of similar to 4 angstrom were
   developed. c-Oriented AFI-type aluminophosphate (AlPO) films (AlPO4-5
   and CoAPO-5), consisting of parallel channels 7.3 angstrom in diameter,
   were first fabricated by seeded growth on macroporous alumina supports,
   and used as templates for synthesis of CNTs inside the zeolitic channels
   by thermal treatment, utilizing the structure directing agent (amine)
   occluded in the channels as carbon source. Incorporation of CNTs inside
   the API channels altered the transport mechanism of all permeating gases
   tested, and imposed a substantial increase in their permeation rates, in
   comparison to the AlPO4-5 membrane, despite the pore size reduction due
   to nanotube growth. The enhancement of the permeation rates is
   attributed to repulsive potentials between gas molecules and occluded
   nanotubes, which limit adsorption strength and enhance diffusivity,
   coupled to the smooth SWCNT surface that enables fast diffusion through
   the nanotube interior. Separation ability, evaluated with respect to H-2
   and CO2 gases, was enhanced by using polysterene as defect-blocking
   medium on both AlPO and CNT/AlPO membranes and was preserved after CNT
   growth.}},

   differentiation via optimized engagement of 3D extracellular matrices}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The extracellular matrix (ECM) impacts stem cell differentiation, but
   identifying formulations supportive of differentiation is challenging in
   3D models. Prior efforts involving combinatorial ECM arrays seemed
   intuitively advantageous. We propose an alternative that suggests
   reducing sample size and technological burden can be beneficial and
   accessible when coupled to design of experiments approaches. We predict
   optimized ECM formulations could augment differentiation of
   cardiomyocytes derived in vitro. We employed native chemical ligation to
   polymerize 3D poly (ethylene glycol) hydrogels under mild conditions
   while entrapping various combinations of ECM and murine induced
   pluripotent stem cells. Systematic optimization for cardiomyocyte
   differentiation yielded a predicted solution of 61\%, 24\%, and 15\% of
   collagen type I, laminin-111, and fibronectin, respectively. This
   solution was confirmed by increased numbers of cardiac troponin T,
   alpha-myosin heavy chain and alpha-sarcomeric actinin-expressing cells
   relative to suboptimum solutions. Cardiomyocytes of composites exhibited
   connexin43 expression, appropriate contractile kinetics and
   intracellular calcium handling. Further, adding a modulator of adhesion,
   thrombospondin-1, abrogated cardiomyocyte differentiation. Thus, the
   integrated biomaterial platform statistically identified an ECM
   formulation best supportive of cardiomyocyte differentiation. In future,
   this formulation could be coupled with biochemical stimulation to
   improve functional maturation of cardiomyocytes derived in vitro or
   transplanted in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical results for the extension of a polymer confined to a channel
   are usually derived in the limit of infinite contour length. But
   experimental studies and simulations of DNA molecules confined to
   nanochannels are not necessarily in this asymptotic limit. We calculate
   the statistics of the span and the end-to-end distance of a semiflexible
   polymer of finite length in the extended de Gennes regime, exploiting
   the fact that the problem can be mapped to a one-dimensional weakly
   self-avoiding random walk. The results thus obtained compare favorably
   with pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method (PERM) simulations of a
   three-dimensional discrete wormlike chain model of DNA confined in a
   nanochannel. We discuss the implications for experimental studies of
   linear lambda-DNA confined to nanochannels at the high ionic strengths
   used in many experiments.}},

Abstract = {{Effectiveness of oil spill dispersants containing lecithin/Tween 80
   (L/T) blends in ethanol was measured as a function of L:T ratio,
   surfactant:solvent ratio, solvent composition, and dispersant:oil ratio
   (DOR) using baffled flask dispersion effectiveness tests. Optimal LT
   ratios are between 60:40 and 80:20 (w/w); at higher LT ratios,
   effectiveness is limited by high interfacial tension, while at lower L:T
   ratios, insufficient lecithin is present to form a well-packed monolayer
   at an oil-water interface. These optimal L:T ratios retain high
   effectiveness at low DOR: 80:20 (w/w) L:T dispersant is 89\% effective
   at 1:25 DOR (v/v) and 77\% effective at 1:100 DOR (v/v). Increasing
   surfactant:solvent ratio increases dispersant effectiveness even when
   DOR is proportionally reduced to keep total surfactant concentration
   dosed into the oil constant. Replacing some of the ethanol with octane
   or octanol also increases dispersant effectiveness, suggesting that
   ethanol's hydrophilicity lowers dispersant-oil miscibility, and that
   more hydrophobic solvents would increase effectiveness, (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Plug-in electric vehicles (EVs) in China aim to improve sustainability
   and reduce environmental health impacts of transport emissions. Urban
   use of EVs rather than conventional vehicles shifts transportation's air
   pollutant emissions from urban areas (tailpipes) to predominantly rural
   areas (power plants), changing the geographic distribution of health
   impacts. We model PM2.5-related health impacts attributable to urban EV
   use for 34 major cities. Our investigation focuses on environmental
   justice (EJ) by comparing pollutant inhalation versus income among
   impacted counties. We find that EVs could increase EJ challenge in
   China: most (similar to 77\%, range: 41-96\%) emission inhalation
   attributable to urban EVs use is distributed to predominately rural
   communities whose incomes are on average lower than the cities where EVs
   are used. Results vary dramatically across cities depending on urban
   income and geography. Discriminant analysis reveals that counties with
   low income and high inhalation of urban EV emissions have comparatively
   higher agricultural employment rates, higher mortality rates, more
   children in the population, and lower education levels. We find that
   low-emission electricity sources such as renewable energy can help
   mitigate EJ issues raised here. Findings here are not unique to EVs, but
   instead are relevant for nearly all electricity-consuming technologies
   in urban areas.}},

Abstract = {{We present periodic nanohole arrays fabricated in free-standing
   metal-coated nitride films as a platform for trapping and analyzing
   single organelles. When a microliterscale droplet containing
   mitochondria is dispensed above the nanohole array, the combination of
   evaporation and capillary flow directs individual mitochondria to the
   nanoholes. Mammalian mitochondria arrays were rapidly formed on chip
   using this technique without any surface modification steps,
   microfluidic interconnects, or external power sources. The trapped
   mitochondria were depolarized on chip using an ionophore with results
   showing that the organelle viability and behavior were preserved during
   the on-chip assembly process. Fluorescence signal related to
   mitochondrial membrane potential was obtained from single mitochondria
   trapped in individual nanoholes revealing statistical differences
   between the behavior of polarized vs depolarized mammalian mitochondria.
   This technique provides a fast and stable route for droplet-based
   directed localization of organelles-on-a-chip with minimal limitations
   and complexity, as well as promotes integration with other optical or
   electrochemical detection techniques.}},

Abstract = {{Spectrum sensing for cognitive radio has focused on detection and
   estimation of aggregate spectra, without regard for latent component
   identification. Unraveling the constituent power spectra and the
   locations of ambient transmitters can be viewed as the next step towards
   situational awareness, which can facilitate efficient opportunistic
   transmission and interference avoidance. This paper focuses on power
   spectra separation and multiple emitter localization using a network of
   multi-antenna receivers. A PARAllel FACtor analysis (PARAFAC)-based
   framework is proposed, which offers an array of attractive features,
   including identifiability guarantees, ability to work with asynchronous
   receivers, and low communication overhead. Dealing with corrupt receiver
   reports due to shadowing or jamming can be a practically important
   concern in this context, and addressing it requires new theory and
   algorithms. A robust PARAFAC formulation and a corresponding
   factorization algorithm are proposed for this purpose, and
   identifiability of the latent factors is theoretically established for
   this more challenging setup. In addition to pertinent simulations, real
   experiments with a software radio prototype are used to demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed approach.}},

   such as an earthquake or explosion that causes liquefaction, resets a
   deposit's ``geological age,{''} data from explosive compaction projects
   in aged deposits are used herein to provide information about both the
   aged and fresh deposits. A recent explosive compaction project performed
   in Griffin, IN, as well as four other explosive compaction projects, is
   used to develop an aging correction relationship for liquefaction
   resistance. Using a log-linear trend frequently proposed in previous
   studies, the method proposed herein predicts an approximate 20\% gain in
   liquefaction resistance per time log cycle. The proposed relationship
   can be used directly if the time since deposition or last disturbance is
   known or in conjunction with the measured-to-estimated-velocity-ratio
   (MEVR) relationship proposed by Andrus et al. if the deposit's age is
   unknown. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Thin films of vapor-deposited metal-free phthalocyanine (H2Pc) were
   studied using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy in the visible
   region. Following photoexcitation, an excited state absorption feature
   located near 532 nm was observed which served as a probe of the excited
   state. For exciton densities larger than 5 x 10(18) excitons/cm(3) the
   time-dependent measurements of the excited state absorption included the
   presence of nonexponential decay kinetics attributed to exciton-exciton
   annihilation. At exciton densities less than 5 x 10(18) excitons/cm(3)
   annihilation was negligible, and the decay kinetics appeared single
   exponential within the signal-to-noise. The fitted time constant, 239
   +/- 24 ps, was attributed to the lifetime decay of the singlet excitons.
   When the H2Pc was diluted into a wide energy gap host via vapor
   deposition, the observed lifetime was significantly reduced, reaching 87
   +/- 9 ps for a concentration of 25\% H2Pc. The decreased exciton
   lifetime with dilution was remarkable since it has been commonly
   reported that excited state lifetimes decrease as the chromophore
   concentration is increased. The reduced lifetime was correlated to the
   loss of alpha-phase ordering as indicated in the UV/vis spectra of the
   films. Within the context of photovoltaic applications this highlights
   the importance of both molecular level ordering and chromophore
   concentration when trying to engineer fundamental material properties
   such as exciton diffusion length.}},

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},

Abstract = {{Metastatic cell homing is a complex process mediated in part by
   diffusible factors secreted from immune cells found at a pre-metastatic
   niche. We report on connecting secretomics and TRanscriptional Activity
   CEll aRray (TRACER) data to identify functional paracrine interactions
   between immune cells and metastatic cells as novel mediators of homing.
   Metastatic breast cancer mouse models were used to generate a diseased
   splenocyte conditioned media (D-SCM) containing immune cell secreted
   factors. MDA-MB-231 metastatic cell activity including cell invasion,
   migration, transendothelial migration, and proliferation were increased
   in D-SCM relative to control media. Our D-SCM secretome analysis yielded
   144 secreted factor candidates that contribute to increased metastatic
   cell activity. The functional mediators of homing were identified using
   MetaCore software to determine interactions between the immune cell
   secretome and the TRACER-identified active transcription factors within
   metastatic cells. Among the 5 candidate homing factors identified,
   haptoglobin was selected and validated in vitro and in vivo as a key
   mediator of homing. Our studies demonstrate a novel systems biology
   approach to identify functional signaling factors associated with a
   cellular phenotype, which provides an enabling tool that complements
   large-scale protein identification provided by proteomics.}},

Abstract = {{Nanoemulsion-like polymer vesicles (polymersomes) having ionic liquid
   interiors dispersed in water are attractive for nanoreactor
   applications. In a previous study, we demonstrated that small molecules
   could pass through rubbery polybutadiene membranes on a time scale of
   seconds, which is practical for chemical transformations. It is of
   interest to determine how sensitive the rate of transport is to
   temperature, particularly for membranes in the vicinity of the glass
   transition (T-g). In this work, the molecular exchange rate of
   1-butylimidazole through glassy polystyrene (PS) bilayer membranes is
   investigated via pulsed field gradient nuclear magnetic resonance
   (PFG-NMR) over the temperature range from 25 to 70 degrees C. The
   vesicles were prepared by the cosolvent method in the ionic liquid
   1-ethyl-3methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl) imide ({[}EMIM]
   {[}TFSID, and four different polystyrene-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (PS-PEO)
   diblock polymers with varying PS molecular weights were examined. The
   vesicles were transferred from the ionic liquid to water at room
   temperature to form nanoemulsion solutions of polymer vesicles in water.
   The exchange rate of 1-butylimidazole added to the aqueous solutions was
   observed under equilibrium conditions at each temperature. The exchange
   rate decreased as the membrane thickness increased, and the exchange
   rate through the glassy membranes was three to four times slower than
   through the rubbery polybutadiene membranes under the same experimental
   conditions. These results demonstrate that the permeability through
   nanosized membranes depends on both the dimension and chemistry of
   membrane-forming blocks. Furthermore, the exchange rate was investigated
   as a function of temperature in the vicinity of the T-g of PS-PEO
   membranes. The exchange rate, however, is not a strong function of the
   temperature in the vicinity of the membrane T-g, due to a combination of
   the nanoscopic dimension of the membrane, and some degree of solvent
   plasticization.}},

Abstract = {{Electrolyte gating enables low voltage operation of organic thin film

   interface: single crystal rubrene/ion-gel. We provide spectroscopic
   signature for free-hole like carriers in the organic semiconductor and
   unambiguously show the presence of a high density of intrinsic doping of
   the free holes upon formation of the rubrene/ion-gel interface, without
   gate bias (V-g = 0 V). We explain this intrinsic doping as resulting
   from a thermodynamic driving force for the stabilization of free holes
   in the organic semiconductor by anions in the ion-gel. Spectroscopy also
   reveals the saturation of free-hole like carrier density at the
   rubrene/ion-gel interface at V-g < -0.5 V, which is commensurate with
   the negative transconductance seen in transistor measurements.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical and experimental analyses of the steady state, bipolar
   diffusion charge distribution on nanoparticles are reviewed. This charge
   distribution plays a critical role in electrical mobility measurements
   of nanoparticle size distribution functions, where it is approximated
   via empirical regression equations. While the regression approach has
   been broadly successful, there remain several unresolved issues related
   to charge distribution calculations. Specifically, research to date has
   not revealed a method to reliably calculate nanoparticle-ion collision
   rates in the presence of strong attractive potentials, charge
   distribution predictions do not routinely consider the mass and
   (electrical) mobility distributions of the charging ions, and
   calculation approaches applicable to both spherical and nonspherical
   particles have not been compared to experimental data. In light of these
   issues, we examine the steady-state bipolar charge distribution on gold
   nanospheres and gold nanorods via tandem differential mobility analysis
   (TDMA). We compare measurements to regression equations as well as to
   Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations, which take ion mobility and mass
   distributions as inputs. These distributions were measured using a DMA
   coupled to a mass spectrometer. Both regression equations and BD
   simulations are found to agree reasonably well with measurements in air,
   and we find that particle mobility diameter has a much greater influence
   on charging than particle morphology. Results support the use of BD
   calculations to predict bipolar charge distributions when ion properties
   are known. Nevertheless, our work supports continued use of regression
   equations when such information is not available.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. Using the Medtronic Activa PC + S system, this study
   investigated how passive joint manipulation, reaching behavior, and deep
   brain stimulation (DBS) modulate local field potential (LFP) activity in
   the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and globus pallidus (GP). Approach. Five
   non-human primates were implanted unilaterally with one or more DBS
   leads. LFPs were collected in montage recordings during resting state
   conditions and during motor tasks that facilitate the expression of
   parkinsonian motor signs. These recordings were made in the naive state
   in one subject, in the parkinsonian state in two subjects, and in both
   naive and parkinsonian states in two subjects. Main results. LFPs
   measured at rest were consistent over time for a given recording
   location and parkinsonian state in a given subject; however, LFPs were
   highly variable between subjects, between and within recording
   locations, and across parkinsonian states. LFPs in both naive and
   parkinsonian states across all recorded nuclei contained a spectral peak
   in the beta band (10-30 Hz). Moreover, the spectral content of recorded
   LFPs was modulated by passive and active movement of the subjects'
   limbs. LFPs recorded during a cued-reaching task displayed task-related
   beta desynchronization in STN and GP. The bidirectional capabilities of
   the Activa (R) PC + S also allowed for recording LFPs while delivering
   DBS. The therapeutic effect of STN DBS on parkinsonian rigidity
   outlasted stimulation for 30-60 s, but there was no correlation with
   beta band power. Significance. This study emphasizes (1) the variability
   in spontaneous LFPs amongst subjects and (2) the value of using the
   Activa (R) PC + S system to record neural data in the context of
   behavioral tasks that allow one to evaluate a subject's symptomatology.}},

Abstract = {{For producing ATP, tumour cells rely on glycolysis leading to lactate to
   about the same extent as on respiration. Thus, the ATP synthesis flux
   from glycolysis is considerably higher than in the corresponding healthy
   cells. This is known as the Warburg effect (named after German
   biochemist Otto H. Warburg) and also applies to striated muscle cells,
   activated lymphocytes, microglia, endothelial cells and several other
   cell types. For similar phenomena in several yeasts and many bacteria,
   the terms Crabtree effect and overflow metabolism respectively, are
   used. The Warburg effect is paradoxical at first sight because the molar
   ATP yield of glycolysis is much lower than that of respiration. Although
   a straightforward explanation is that glycolysis allows a higher ATP
   production rate, the question arises why cells do not re-allocate
   protein to the high-yield pathway of respiration. Mathematical modelling
   can help explain this phenomenon. Here, we review several models at
   various scales proposed in the literature for explaining the Warburg
   effect. These models support the hypothesis that glycolysis allows for a
   higher proliferation rate due to increased ATP production and precursor
   supply rates.}},

Abstract = {{Among wood-degrading fungi, lineages holding taxa that selectively
   metabolize carbohydrates without significant lignin removal (brown rot)
   are polyphyletic, having evolved multiple times from lignin-removing
   white rot fungi. Given the qualitative nature of the `brown rot'
   classifier, we aimed to quantify and compare the temporal sequence of
   carbohydrate removal among brown rot clades. Lignocellulose
   deconstruction was compared among fungi using distinct plant substrates
   (angiosperm, conifer, grass). Specifically, aspen, pine and corn stalk
   were harvested over a 16-week time series from microcosms containing
   Gloeophyllum trabeum, Fomitopsis pinicola, Ossicaulis lignatilis,
   Fistulina hepatica, Serpula lacrymans, Wolfiporia cocos or Dacryopinax
   sp. After quantifying plant mass loss, a thorough compositional analysis
   was complemented by a saccharification test to determine wood cell wall
   accessibility. Mass loss and accessibility varied depending on fungal
   decomposer and substrate, and trajectories of loss for hemicellulosic
   components and cellulose differed among plant tissue types. At any given
   stage of decomposition, however, lignocellulose accessibility and the
   fraction remaining of carbohydrates and lignin within a plant tissue
   type were generally the same, regardless of fungal isolate. This
   suggests that the sequence of plant component removal at this typical
   scale of characterization is shared among these brown rot lineages,
   despite their diverse genomes and secretomes.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate lossy compression (source coding) of data in the form of
   permutations. This problem has direct applications in the storage of
   ordinal data or rankings, and in the analysis of sorting algorithms. We
   analyze the rate-distortion characteristic for the permutation space
   under the uniform distribution, and the minimum achievable rate of
   compression that allows a bounded distortion after recovery. Our
   analysis is with respect to different practical and useful distortion
   measures, including Kendall tau distance, Spearman's footrule, Chebyshev
   distance, and inversion-l(1) distance. We establish equivalence of
   source code designs under certain distortions and show simple explicit
   code designs that incur low encoding/decoding complexities and are
   asymptotically optimal. Finally, we show that for the Mallows model, a
   popular nonuniform ranking model on the permutation space, both the
   entropy and the maximum distortion at zero rate are much lower than the
   uniform counterparts, which motivates the future design of efficient
   compression schemes for this model.}},

Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},

Abstract = {{High-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) is widely used for transcript
   quantification of gene isoforms. Since RNA-Seq data alone is often not
   sufficient to accurately identify the read origins from the isoforms for
   quantification, we propose to explore protein domain-domain interactions
   as prior knowledge for integrative analysis with RNA-Seq data. We
   introduce a Network-based method for RNA-Seq-based Transcript
   Quantification (Net-RSTQ) to integrate protein domain-domain interaction
   network with short read alignments for transcript abundance estimation.
   Based on our observation that the abundances of the neighboring isoforms
   by domain-domain interactions in the network are positively correlated,
   Net-RSTQ models the expression of the neighboring transcripts as
   Dirichlet priors on the likelihood of the observed read alignments
   against the transcripts in one gene. The transcript abundances of all
   the genes are then jointly estimated with alternating optimization of
   multiple EM problems. In simulation Net-RSTQ effectively improved
   isoform transcript quantifications when isoform co-expressions correlate
   with their interactions. qRT-PCR results on 25 multi-isoform genes in a
   stem cell line, an ovarian cancer cell line, and a breast cancer cell
   line also showed that Net-RSTQ estimated more consistent isoform
   proportions with RNA-Seq data. In the experiments on the RNA-Seq data in
   The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the transcript abundances estimated by
   Net-RSTQ are more informative for patient sample classification of
   ovarian cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer. All experimental results
   collectively support that Net-RSTQ is a promising approach for isoform
   quantification. Net-RSTQ toolbox is available at
   http://compbio.cs.umn.edu/Net-RSTQ/.}},

Abstract = {{As a supporting primitive of many mobile applications, neighbor
   discovery identifies nearby devices so that they can exchange
   information and collaborate in a peer-to-peer manner. To date, discovery
   schemes trade a long latency for energy efficiency and require a
   collaborative duty cycle pattern, and thus they are not suitable for
   interactive mobile applications where a user is unable to configure
   others' devices. In this article, we propose Acc, which serves as an
   on-demand generic discovery accelerating middleware for many
   deterministic neighbor discovery schemes. Acc leverages the discovery
   capabilities of neighbor devices, supporting both direct and indirect
   neighbor discoveries. Further, we present a proactive online rendezvous
   maintenance mechanism, which is used to reduce delays for the detection
   of leaving of neighbors. Our evaluations show that Acc-assisted
   discovery schemes reduce latency by up to 51.8\% compared to schemes
   consuming the same amount of energy. More importantly, to prove the
   real-world value of Acc, we further present and evaluate a Crowd-Alert
   application where Acc is employed by taxi drivers to accelerate
   selection of a direction with fewer competing taxis and more potential
   passengers, based on a 280GB dataset of more than 14,000 taxis in
   Shenzhen, the most crowded city in China.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, we consider the numerical solution of large nonlinear
   eigenvalue problems that arise in thermoacoustic simulations involved in
   the stability analysis of large combustion devices. We briefly introduce
   the physical modeling that leads to a nonlinear eigenvalue problem that
   is solved using a nonlinear fixed point iteration scheme. Each step of
   this nonlinear method requires the solution of a complex non-Hermitian
   linear eigenvalue problem. We review a set of state-of-the-art
   eigensolvers and discuss strategies to recycle spectral information from
   one nonlinear step to the next. More precisely, we consider the
   Jacobi-Davidson algorithm, the Implicitly Restarted Arnoldi method, the
   Krylov-Schur solver and its block-variant, and the subspace iteration
   method with Chebyshev acceleration. On a small test example, we study
   the relevance of the different approaches and illustrate on a large
   industrial test case the performance of the parallel solvers best suited
   to recycle spectral information for large-scale thermoacoustic stability

Abstract = {{A fundamental question in biology is whether the presence of
   non-reacting macromolecules in the cytoplasm affects the rates and
   extents of reversible association reactions, a phenomenon often referred
   to as `macromolecular crowding.' Under certain conditions, crowding has
   been proposed to dramatically alter the kinetics and thermodynamics of
   chemical reactions, making it difficult to quantitatively relate rates
   and extents of reactions measured in vitro to those occurring in vivo.
   In this work, we use Brownian dynamics simulation and Monte Carlo
   methods to (1) quantify the overall thermodynamic and kinetic effects of
   crowding by independently investigating each step of reversible
   bimolecular association (i.e. translational diffusion, steric specific
   binding, and dissociation), and (2) provide an explicit, quantitative
   investigation of how the degree of steric specificity of protein
   dimerization influences crowding-mediated effects on association and
   dissociation. We find that k(on) decreases by similar to 2-fold for
   non-steric specific reactions, and increases by similar to 3-fold for
   highly steric specific reactions. In addition, k(off) decreases by only
   similar to 30\%-60\% in the presence of crowders, depending on the
   strength of the bond between the reactant pair, so that the equilibrium
   constant is increased by similar to 4-fold, at most. These results
   suggest that crowding-mediated effects on globular protein dimerization
   reactions in the cytoplasm are modulated by the steric specificity of
   the reactants, and that reversible protein-protein association is
   relatively insensitive to the physical presence of crowders (i.e. steric
   repulsion effects in the cytoplasm) for crowders of similar size and
   shape to reactants over a range of volume fractions (0-0.3).}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite the importance of thermoelastic properties of minerals in
   geology and geophysics, their measurement at high pressures and
   temperatures are still challenging. Thus, ab initio calculations are an
   essential tool for predicting these properties at extreme conditions.
   Owing to the approximate description of the exchange-correlation energy,
   approximations used in calculations of vibrational effects, and
   numerical/methodological approximations, these methods produce
   systematic deviations. Hybrid schemes combining experimental data and
   theoretical results have emerged as a way to reconcile available
   information and offer more reliable predictions at experimentally
   inaccessible thermodynamics conditions. Here we introduce a method to
   improve the calculated thermoelastic tensor by using highly accurate
   thermal equation of state (EoS). The corrective scheme is general,
   applicable to crystalline solids with any symmetry, and can produce
   accurate results at conditions where experimental data may not exist. We
   apply it to rock-salt-type NaCl, a material whose structural properties
   have been challenging to describe accurately by standard ab initio
   methods and whose acoustic/seismic properties are important for the gas
   and oil industry. (C) 2015 Author(s). All article content, except where

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{AIM Individuals with cerebral palsy (CP) have impaired movement due to a
   brain injury near birth. Understanding how neuromuscular control is
   altered in CP can provide insight into pathological movement. We sought
   to determine if individuals with CP demonstrate reduced complexity of
   neuromuscular control during gait compared with unimpaired individuals
   and if changes in control are related to functional ability.
   METHOD Muscle synergies during gait were retrospectively analyzed for
   633 individuals (age range 3.9-70y): 549 with CP (hemiplegia, n= 122;
   diplegia, n= 266; triplegia, n= 73; quadriplegia, n= 88) and 84
   unimpaired individuals. Synergies were calculated using non-negative
   matrix factorization from surface electromyography collected during
   previous clinical gait analyses. Synergy complexity during gait was
   compared with diagnosis subtype, functional ability, and clinical
   examination measures.
   RESULT Fewer synergies were required to describe muscle activity during
   gait in individuals with CP compared with unimpaired individuals.
   Changes in synergies were related to functional impairment and clinical
   examination measures including selective motor control, strength, and
   spasticity.
   INTERPRETATION Individuals with CP use a simplified control strategy
   during gait compared with unimpaired individuals. These results were
   similar to synergies during walking among adult stroke survivors,
   suggesting similar neuromuscular control strategies between these
   clinical populations.}},

Abstract = {{Aim Functional traits of organisms are key to understanding and
   predicting biodiversity and ecological change, which motivates
   continuous collection of traits and their integration into global
   databases. Such trait matrices are inherently sparse, severely limiting
   their usefulness for further analyses. On the other hand, traits are
   characterized by the phylogenetic trait signal, trait-trait correlations
   and environmental constraints, all of which provide information that
   could be used to statistically fill gaps. We propose the application of
   probabilistic models which, for the first time, utilize all three
   characteristics to fill gaps in trait databases and predict trait values
   at larger spatial scales.
   Innovation For this purpose we introduce BHPMF, a hierarchical Bayesian
   extension of probabilistic matrix factorization ( PMF). PMF is a machine
   learning technique which exploits the correlation structure of sparse
   matrices to impute missing entries. BHPMF additionally utilizes the
   taxonomic hierarchy for trait prediction and provides uncertainty
   estimates for each imputation. In combination with multiple regression
   against environmental information, BHPMF allows for extrapolation from
   point measurements to larger spatial scales. We demonstrate the
   applicability of BHPMF in ecological contexts, using different plant
   functional trait datasets, also comparing results to taking the species
   mean and PMF.
   Main conclusions Sensitivity analyses validate the robustness and
   accuracy of BHPMF: our method captures the correlation structure of the
   trait matrix as well as the phylogenetic trait signal-also for extremely
   sparse trait matrices-and provides a robust measure of confidence in
   prediction accuracy for each missing entry. The combination of BHPMF
   with environmental constraints provides a promising concept to
   extrapolate traits beyond sampled regions, accounting for intraspecific
   trait variability. We conclude that BHPMF and its derivatives have a
   high potential to support future trait-based research in macroecology
   and functional biogeography.}},

Abstract = {{The capacitance-based sensing of fully-depleted silicon-on-insulator
   (FDSOI) variable capacitors for Co-60 gamma radiation is investigated.
   Linear response of the capacitance is observed for radiation dose up to
   64 Gy, while the percent capacitance change per unit dose is as high as
   0.24\%/Gy. An analytical model is developed to study the operational
   principles of the varactors and the maximum sensitivity as a function of
   frequency is determined. The results show that FDSOI varactor dosimeters
   have potential for extremely-high sensitivity as well as the potential
   for high frequency operation in applications such as wireless radiation
   sensing.}},

Abstract = {{Explosive growth in geospatial and temporal data as well as the
   emergence of new technologies emphasize the need for automated discovery
   of spatiotemporal knowledge. Spatiotemporal data mining studies the
   process of discovering interesting and previously unknown, but
   potentially useful patterns from large spatiotemporal databases. It has
   broad application domains including ecology and environmental
   management, public safety, transportation, earth science, epidemiology,
   and climatology. The complexity of spatiotemporal data and intrinsic
   relationships limits the usefulness of conventional data science
   techniques for extracting spatiotemporal patterns. In this survey, we
   review recent computational techniques and tools in spatiotemporal data
   mining, focusing on several major pattern families: spatiotemporal
   outlier, spatiotemporal coupling and tele-coupling, spatiotemporal
   prediction, spatiotemporal partitioning and summarization,
   spatiotemporal hotspots, and change detection. Compared with other
   surveys in the literature, this paper emphasizes the statistical
   foundations of spatiotemporal data mining and provides comprehensive
   coverage of computational approaches for various pattern families. We
   also list popular software tools for spatiotemporal data analysis. The
   survey concludes with a look at future research needs.}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The self-assembly of bottlebrush block polymers into a lamellar phase
   was investigated using a combination of experiment and self-consistent
   field theory (SCFT). Nine diblock bottlebrush polymers were synthesized
   with atadic polypropylene side chains (block A) and polystyrene side
   chains (block B) attached to poly(norbornene) backbones of various
   contour lengths, L, and the resulting lamellar structures were analyzed
   using small-angle X-ray scattering. The scaling of the lamellar period,
   d(0) similar to L-gamma, exhibited an increasing exponent from gamma
   approximate to 0.3 at small L to gamma approximate to 0.9 at large L.
   The small exponents occurred for starlike molecules where the size of
   the side chains is comparable to L, while the larger exponents occurred
   for the more brushlike molecules where the side chains extend radially
   outward from the backbone. The bottlebrushes were then modeled using
   flexible side chains of types A and B attached to a semiflexible
   backbone with an adjustable persistence length, xi(b). The resulting
   SCFT predictions for d(0) showed remarkable quantitative agreement with
   the experimental data, where xi(b) was similar to the radius of the
   bottlebrushes. The theory was then used to examine the
   joint-distribution functions for the position and orientation of
   different segments along the backbone. This revealed a bilayer
   arrangement of the bottlebrushes in the lamellar phase, with a high
   degree of backbone orientation at the A/B interfaces that almost
   completely vanished near the center of the domains. This finding clearly
   refutes the prevailing interpretation that the large scaling exponent
   gamma is a result of highly extended backbone conformations.}},

Abstract = {{The yeast Debaryomyces hansenii overproduces riboflavin upon exposure to
   subtoxic levels of cobalt (Co+2). However, mechanisms for survival have
   yet to be studied and have been hindered by D. hansenii's high genetic
   heterogeneity among strains. In this study, we used transcriptomic
   analyses and RNA-seq in order to identify differentially expressed genes
   in D. hansenii in response to cobalt exposure. Highly upregulated genes
   under this condition were identified to primarily comprise DNA damage
   and repair genes, oxidative stress response genes, and genes for cell
   wall integrity and growth. The main response of D. hansenii to heavy
   metal stress is the activation of non-enzymatic oxidative stress
   response mechanisms and control of biological production of reactive
   oxygen species. Our results indicate that D. hansenii does not seem to
   be pre-adapted to survive high concentrations of heavy metals. These
   organisms appear to possess genetic survival and detoxification
   mechanisms that enable the cells to recover from heavy metal stress.}},

Abstract = {{Potassium and phosphorus represent inorganics commonly found in biomass
   and can significantly affect catalytic gasification of biomass. The
   alkaline and acidic nature of potassium and phosphorus, respectively,
   can introduce different reaction chemistries. In this paper, the effects
   of potassium and phosphorus on Rh catalysts for catalytic gasification
   have been studied at different file/oxygen ratios and temperatures.
   Catalytic partial oxidation (CPO) of ethanol, a biomass surrogate, was
   carried out over potassium, phosphorus, and monobasic
   potassium-phosphate-doped catalysts at loadings of 0.1, 1, 10, and 100\%
   of Rh atoms over a range of fuel/oxygen ratios. In addition,
   time-on-stream studies were also carried out with methane by predosing
   inorganics on the catalyst (10\% loading) and ethanol by introducing
   inorganics in the feed (0.05 mol \%) to understand their effects on the
   stability of autothermal operation. With ethanol CPO, synthesis gas
   selectivities did not change significantly with potassium-doped
   catalysts, Whereas they decreased with phosphorus,doped catalysts.
   Monobasic potassium phosphate showed synergistic effects of potassium
   and phosphorus; however, at higher temperatures, the effect of
   phosphorus was predominantly observed as a result of volatilization of
   potassium. Similarly, with time-on-stream studies with methane CPO,
   potassium volatilized at higher temperatures, while phosphorus retained
   its catalytic activity at higher temperatures. With the introduction of
   potassium and phosphorus in ethanol feed, steady-state autothermal
   operation was possible without any deactivation of the catalyst. In all
   experiments, phosphorus exhibited a stronger poisoning effect on rhodium
   for catalytic partial oxidation than potassium at concentrations.}},

Abstract = {{Production of hydrogen and synthesis gas via solar thermochemical
   partial redox cycles is one route to renewable fuels and storage of
   solar energy, The efficiency at which these cycles produce fuel for
   candidate non stoichiometric metal oxides and reactor concepts is
   normally evaluated from thermodynamic models that implicitly assume that
   the transport processes and reaction kinetics are rapid enough that the
   gas and solid attain chemical equilibrium. In this paper,we develop in
   equilibrium model of a fixed-bed reactor and demonstrate its
   applicability for reduction and oxidation of porous ceria (CeO2)
   particles with a volume-specific surface area of similar to 10(6) m(2)
   m(-3) over a wide range of gas flew rates and reaction temperatures. The
   model predicts the measured rate of O-2 production during reduction for
   mass-specific flow rates up to 900 mL min(-1) g(ceria)(-1) and for
   temperatures from 740 to 1500 degrees C, and it predicts the measured
   rate of CO production,during oxidation for flow rates up to 50 mL
   min(-1) g(ceria)(-1) at 1500 degrees C. It does not apply for oxidation
   below 930 degrees C. We compare the equilibrium model developed for the
   fixed-bed reactor to the models for the mixed flow and countercurrent
   flow reactors. In comparison to the mixed flow reactor, the fixed-bed
   reactor reduces the sweep gas and excess oxidizer required for fuel
   production, an important step toward increasing efficiency Closer to the
   theoretical limit established by the countercurrent flow reactor.}},

Abstract = {{Focused ultrasound (FUS) has been proposed for a variety of transcranial
   applications, including neuromodulation, tumor ablation, and blood-brain
   barrier opening. A flurry of activity in recent years has generated
   encouraging results demonstrating its feasibility in these and other
   applications. To date, monitoring of FUS beams has been primarily
   accomplished using MR guidance, where both MR thermography and
   elastography have been used. The recent introduction of real-time
   dual-mode ultrasound array (DMUA) systems offers a new paradigm in
   transcranial focusing. In this paper, we present first experimental
   results of ultrasound-guided transcranial FUS (tFUS) application in a
   rodent brain, both ex vivo and in vivo. DMUA imaging is used for
   visualization of the treatment region for placement of the focal spot
   within the brain. This includes the detection and localization of
   pulsating blood vessels at or near the target point(s). In addition,
   DMUA imaging is used to monitor and localize the FUS-tissue interactions
   in real time. In particular, a concave (40 mm radius of curvature),
   32-element, 3.5-MHz DMUA prototype was used for imaging and tFUS
   application in ex vivo and in vivo rat models. The ex vivo experiments
   were used to evaluate the point spread function of the transcranial DMUA
   imaging at various points within the brain. In addition, DMUA-based
   transcranial ultrasound thermography measurements were compared with
   thermocouple measurements of subtherapeutic tFUS heating in rat brain ex
   vivo. The ex vivo setting was also used to demonstrate the capability of
   DMUA to produce localized thermal lesions. The in vivo experiments were
   designed to demonstrate the ability of the DMUA to apply, monitor, and
   localize subtherapeutic tFUS patterns that could be beneficial in
   transient blood-brain barrier opening. The results show that although
   the DMUA focus is degraded due to the propagation through the skull, it
   still produces localized heating effects within a sub-millimeter volume.
   In addition, DMUA transcranial echo data from brain tissue allow for
   reliable estimation of temperature change.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Pages = {{251-260}},

Abstract = {{Riblet films are a passive method of turbulent boundary layer control
   that can reduce viscous drag. They have been studied with great detail
   for over 30 years. Although common riblet applications include flows
   with Adverse Pressure Gradients (APG), nearly all research thus far has
   been performed in channel flows. Recent research has provided motivation
   to study riblets in more complicated turbulent flows with claims that
   riblet drag reduction can double in mild APG common to airfoils at
   moderate angles of attack. Therefore, in this study, we compare drag
   reduction by scalloped riblet films between riblets in a zero pressure
   gradient and those in a mild APG using high-resolution large eddy
   simulations. In order to gain a fundamental understanding of the
   relationship between drag reduction and pressure gradient, we simulated
   several different riblet sizes that encompassed a broad range of s(+)
   (riblet width in wall units), similarly to many previously published
   experimental studies. We found that there was only a slight improvement
   in drag reduction for riblets in the mild APG. We also observed that
   peak values of streamwise turbulence intensity, turbulent kinetic
   energy, and streamwise vorticity scale with riblet width. Primary
   Reynolds shear stresses and turbulence kinetic energy production however
   scale with the ability of the riblet to reduce skin-friction. (C) 2015

Title = {{Long-Term Echocardiographic Response to Cardiac Resynchronization

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES The aim of this study was to investigate the frequency and
   clinical implications of a delayed echocardiographic response to cardiac
   resynchronization therapy (CRT).
   BACKGROUND Long-term prognosis for CRT patients is routinely based on
   the assessment of echocardiograms after 6 to 12 months of therapy. Some
   patients, however, may require a Longer period of therapy before
   echocardiographic improvements are detectable.
   METHODS This observational study included all patients with heart
   failure (HF) receiving a CRT device at a single center from 2003 to
   2011. Eligible patients met current indications and had technically
   adequate echocardiograms from before implantation, approximately 1 year
   after implantation (mid-term), and >= 3 years after implantation
   (long-term). A positive echocardiographic response to CRT was defined as
   a reduction in left ventricular end-systolic volume >= 15\%. All-cause
   mortality was compared for patients in 3 response groups: mid-term
   responders, Long-term responders, and nonresponders.
   RESULTS During this study, 294 patients met the study criteria. Of the
   120 patients who were nonresponders after 1 year, 52 (43\%) experienced
   a delayed positive response. Delayed, Long-term responders had mortality
   and hospitalization rates similar to mid-term responders and
   significantly Lower than nonresponders.
   CONCLUSIONS Among patients surviving at Least 3 years after implantation
   of a CRT device and with echocardiographic follow-up, a significant
   portion of nonresponders after 1 year of CRT experience a delayed
   echocardiographic response after a longer period of time. Survival and
   hospitalization rates were similar for all echocardiographic responders,
   regardless of the time at which the response occurred. (J Am Coll

Journal = {{SOLAR ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{122}},
Pages = {{472-485}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we investigate the ability of porous tubes to maintain
   thermal stratification in a water storage tank in comparison to a
   top-mounted inlet pipe. Transient distributions of temperature and
   velocity are presented for operating conditions and a tank geometry
   representative of solar domestic hot water systems using a transient
   two-dimensional computational fluid dynamic model. The stratification in
   the tank is quantified by a dimensionless exergy efficiency. The results
   demonstrate the importance of selection of the permeability of the
   manifold on performance. A porous manifold improves thermal
   stratification for intermediate charging, regardless of the choice of
   permeability. Over a large range of Richardson number, the manifold is
   most effective for a dimensionless permeability, defined by the ratio of
   the pressure drop across the porous wall to the axial pressure gradient,
   equal to 0.02. Such a manifold will deliver the fluid to the tank in a
   narrow band at the vertical position of neutral buoyancy and will
   prevent suction of warmer fluid stored at the top of the tank into the
   manifold. For top charging the porous manifold is comparable in
   performance to a well-designed inlet pipe. Recommendations of selection
   of porous material based on dimensionless permeability are provided. (C)

Abstract = {{Metal oxide semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) exhibit localized surface
   plasmon resonances (LSPRs) tunable within the infrared (IR) region of
   the electromagnetic spectrum by vacancy or impurity doping. Although a
   variety of these NCs have been produced using colloidal synthesis
   methods, incorporation and activation of dopants in the liquid phase has
   often been challenging. Herein, using Al-doped ZnO (AZO) NCs as an
   example, we demonstrate the potential of nontherrnal plasma synthesis as
   an alternative strategy for the production of doped metal oxide NCs.
   Exploiting unique, thoroughly nonequilibrium synthesis conditions, we
   obtain NCs in which dopants are not segregated to the NC surfaces and
   local doping levels are high near the NC centers. Thus, we achieve
   overall doping levels as high as 2 x 1020 cm(-3) in NCs with diameters
   ranging from 12.6 to 3.6 nm, and for the first time experimentally
   demonstrate a clear quantum confinement blue shift of the LSPR energy in
   vacancy- and impurity-doped semiconductor NCs. We propose that doping of
   central cores and heavy doping of small NCs are achievable via
   nonthermal plasma synthesis, because chemical potential differences
   between dopant and host atoms which hinder dopant incorporation in
   colloidal synthesis are irrelevant when NC nucleation and growth proceed
   via irreversible interactions among highly reactive gas-phase ions and
   radicals and ligand-free NC surfaces. We explore how the distinctive
   nucleation and growth kinetics occurring in the plasma influences dopant
   distribution and activation, defect structure, and impurity phase
   formation.}},

Abstract = {{Chiral plasmonic systems have been shown to exhibit large chiroptical
   responses, much larger than those found in molecular or solid state
   systems. In this Letter, we investigate the role of resonant coupling in
   such systems and whether the formation of collective plasmonic modes in
   a chiral assembly of metallic nanostructures is a necessary condition
   for chiroptical response. We show in experiment and simulation that
   off-resonant coupling between spectrally detuned nanostructures arranged
   with structural chirality leads to a clear but weak chiroptical
   response. We interpret our results in the framework of scattering
   between the individual constituents that in turn leads to a chiroptical
   farfield response. We envision that our results will allow further
   tuning and manipulation of chiroptical responses in plasmonic systems
   for tailored chiral light matter interaction.}},

Abstract = {{Existing work on flooding in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) mainly
   focuses on single-packet problem, while the work on sequential
   multipacket problem is surprisingly little. This paper proposes OppCode,
   a new opportunistic networkcoding-based flooding architecture for
   multipacket dissemination in WSNs, where both unreliable and correlated
   links commonly exist. Instead of flooding a single packet each time,
   each node encodes multiple native packets chosen from a specific
   fixed-size page to an encoded packet and then rebroadcasts it further.
   The key idea consists of two parts. One is opportunistically coding
   decision, in which each node grasps every possible coding opportunity
   greedily to maximize its aggregate coding gain of all neighbors based on
   the probabilistic estimation of packets each neighbor already has. The
   other is paged collective acknowledgements (ACKs), in which one
   rebroadcast acts as not only an implicit ACK of successful
   disseminations of all packets in the entire page for the sender, but
   also probabilistic ACK to update page-scale per-packet coverage
   estimations for its neighbors in a batch. Experiments based on extensive
   simulations and 21-node testbed show that OppCode significantly
   increases performance of multipacket flooding in terms of reliability,
   transmission overhead, delay, and load balance.}},

Abstract = {{A multi-sensor flexible strip is developed for a urethral catheter to
   measure distributed pressure in a human urethra. The developed sensor
   strip has important clinical applications in urodynamic testing for
   analyzing the causes of urinary incontinence in patients. There are two
   major challenges in the development of the sensor. First, a highly
   sensitive sensor strip that is flexible enough for urethral insertion
   into a human body is required. Second, the sensor has to work reliably
   in a liquid in vivo environment in the human body. Capacitive force
   sensors are designed and micro-fabricated using
   polyimide/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrates and copper electrodes.
   To remove the parasitic influence of urethral tissues, which create
   fringe capacitance that can lead to significant errors, a reference
   fringe capacitance measurement sensor is incorporated on the strip. The
   sensing strip is embedded on a catheter and experimental in vitro
   evaluation is presented using a bench-top pressure chamber. The sensors
   on the strip are able to provide the required sensitivity and the range.
   Preliminary experimental results also show promise that by using
   measurements from the reference parasitic sensor on the strip, the
   influence of parasitics from human tissue on the pressure measurements
   can be removed. {[}2014-0316]}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the implementation of an automated roll-to-roll
   fluidic self-assembly system based on the surface tension driven
   self-assembly with applications in the field of macroelectronics. The
   reported system incorporates automated agitation, web motion, component
   dispensing, and recycling. The process enables the assembly and
   electrical connection of semiconductor dieschips in a continuous and
   parallel fashion over wide area substrates. At present, the method
   achieves an assembly rate of 15 000 chips per hour and an assembly yield
   exceeding 99\%, testing assembly of standard square-shaped dies,
   300-1000 mu m size. Scaling the system to any desired throughput is
   possible due to the parallel manner of self-assembly. The identification
   and the modeling of the relationship between process parameters and
   forces have been studied and experimentally verified by testing the
   effect of the web angle, agitation on assembly, and detachment rates. As
   an application, we demonstrate the realization of a solid-state lighting
   module. This particular application requires the assembly of a
   conductive multilayer sandwich structure, which is achieved by combining
   the introduced assembly process with a novel lamination step.

Abstract = {{We report synthetic six-tailed mimics of the bacterial glycolipid Lipid
   A that trigger changes in the internal ordering of water-dispersed
   liquid crystal (LC) microdroplets at ultralow (picogram-per-milliliter)
   concentrations. These molecules represent the first class of synthetic
   amphiphiles to mimic the ability of Lipid A and bacterial endotoxins to
   trigger optical responses in LC droplets at these ultralow
   concentrations. This behavior stands in contrast to all previously
   reported synthetic surfactants and lipids, which require near-complete
   monolayer coverage at the LC droplet surface to trigger ordering
   transitions. Surface-pressure measurements and SAXS experiments reveal
   these six-tailed synthetic amphiphiles to mimic key aspects of the
   self-assembly of Lipid A at aqueous interfaces and in solution. These
   and other results suggest that these amphiphiles trigger orientational
   transitions at ultralow concentrations through a unique mechanism that
   is similar to that of Lipid A and involves formation of inverted
   self-associated nanostructures at topological defects in the LC
   droplets.}},

   were made by flash nanoprecipitation (FNP) using a confined impingement
   jet mixer with a dilution step (CIJ-D). The resulting nanoparticles were
   80-150 nm in size with a loading level of 47-74 wt \% (wt \%) of a
   PTX-silicate, which corresponds to 36-59 effective wt \% of free PTX.
   Cryogenic transmission electron microscopy images show that particles
   are typically spherical with a core shell structure. Prodrug/drug
   release profiles Release tended to be slower for prodrugs having greater
   hydrophobicity and slower hydrolysis rate. Nanopartides loaded with
   PTX-silicate prodrugs that hydrolyze most rapidly showed in vitro
   cytotcodcity similar to that of the parent PTX. Nanopartides loaded with
   more labile silicates also tended to show greater in vivo efficacy.}},

Journal = {{PHYSICS OF THE EARTH AND PLANETARY INTERIORS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{249}},

Abstract = {{MgGeO3-perovskite is known to be a low-pressure analog of
   MgSiO3-perovskite in many respects, but especially in regard to the
   post-perovskite transition. As such, investigation of spin state changes
   in Fe-bearing MgGeO3 might help to clarify some aspects of this type of
   state change in Fe-bearing MgSiO3. Using DFT + U calculations, we have
   investigated pressure induced spin state changes in Fe2+ and Fe3+ in
   MgGeO3 perovskite and post-perovskite. Owing to the larger ionic radius
   of germanium compared to silicon, germanate phases have larger unit cell
   volume and inter-atomic distances than equivalent silicate phases at
   same pressures. As a result, all pressure induced state changes in iron
   occur at higher pressures in germanate phases than in the silicate ones,
   be it a spin state change or position change of (ferrous) iron in the
   perovskite A site. We showed that iron state transitions occur at
   particular average Fe-O bond-length (i.e., similar to 2.22(1) angstrom
   and similar to 1.86(1) angstrom for Fe2+ and Fe3+ substitutions,
   respectively) irrespective of mineral composition (silicate or
   germanate) or exchange-correlation functionals used in the calculation
   (LDA + U-sc or GGA + U-sc). Ferrous iron substitution decreases the
   perovskite to postperovskite (PPv) transition pressure while coupled
   ferric iron substitution increases it noticeably. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {{Numerical study of high speed jets in crossflow}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{785}},
Pages = {{152-188}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Large-eddy simulation (LES) and dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) are
   used to study an underexpanded sonic jet injected into a supersonic
   crossflow and an overexpanded supersonic jet injected into a subsonic
   crossflow, where the flow conditions are based on the experiments of
   Santiago \& Dutton (J. Propul. Power, vol. 13 (2), 1997, pp. 264-273)
   and Beresh et al. (AIAA J., vol. 43, 2005a, pp. 379-389), respectively.
   The simulations successfully reproduce experimentally observed shock
   systems and vortical structures. The time averaged flow fields are
   compared to the experimental results, and good agreement is observed.
   The behaviour of the flow is discussed, and the similarities and
   differences between the two regimes are studied. The trajectory of the
   transverse jet is investigated. A modification to Schetz et al.'s theory
   is proposed (Schetz \& Billig, J. Spacecr. Rockets, vol. 3, 1996, pp.
   1658-1665), which yields good prediction of the jet trajectories in the
   current simulations in the near field. Point spectra taken at various
   locations in the flowfield indicate a global oscillation for the sonic
   jet flow, wherein different regions in the flow oscillate with a
   frequency of St = fD/u infinity = 0.3. For supersonic jet flow, no such
   global frequency is observed. Dynamic mode decomposition of the
   three-dimensional pressure field obtained from LES is performed and
   shows the same behaviour. The DMD results indicate that the St = 0.3
   mode is dominant between the upstream barrel shock and the bow shock for
   the sonic jet, while the roll up of the upstream shear layer is dominant
   for the supersonic jet.}},

Abstract = {{Indoor air quality has great impact on the human health. An increasing
   number of studies have shown that printers could release particulate
   matters and pose adverse effects on indoor air quality. In this study, a
   thorough investigation was designed to assess the aerosol printer
   particle total number concentration (TNC) and size distribution in
   normal office environment, one copy center, and a clean chamber.
   Particle analyzers, SMPS, OPS, and CPC3007 were used to monitor the
   total printing process. In normal office environment, 37 laser printers
   out of all surveyed 55 printers were classified as high particle
   emitters. Comparing to laser printers, 5 inkjet printers showed no
   particle emission. Particle emission level in a copy center increased
   slightly with TNC elevating to about 2 times of the aerosol background.
   Simulating test in a clean chamber indicated that printer-emitted
   particles were dominated by particles in nanoscale (diameter of
   particle, D-p < 100 nm). These particles in a sealed clean chamber
   attenuated so slowly that it still held at high level with the
   concentration of 1.5 x 10(4) particles/cm(3) after printing for 2.5
   hours. Our present results demonstrate that printers indeed release
   particulates which keeping at a high concentration level in the indoor
   environment. Special care should be taken to this kind of widely applied
   machines and effective controls of particle emission at printing
   processes are necessary.}},

Title = {{Case report of vasovagal syncope associated with single pulse
   transcranial magnetic stimulation in a healthy adult participant}},
Journal = {{BMC NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{DEC 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: Non-invasive brain stimulation-related seizures or syncopal
   events are rare. However, we report on a syncopal event in a healthy
   female during a transcranial magnetic stimulation single-pulse testing
   session.
   Case presentation: A 47-year-old healthy female presented for a
   transcranial magnetic stimulation session involving single-pulse
   assessment of cortical excitability. During the session, the participant
   appeared to have a brief event involving fainting and myoclonic jerks of
   the upper extremities. Orthostatic assessment was performed after the
   event and physician evaluation determined that this was a vasovagal
   syncopal event. The ethical aspects of this neurophysiology testing
   protocol were reviewed by the University of Minnesota Institutional
   Review Board (IRB), and formal IRB approval was deemed unnecessary for
   single-pulse assessment of healthy control participants not directly
   involved in a research study. Informed consent was obtained by the
   participant, including review of potential adverse events.
   Conclusion: Although rare and rarely reported, vasovagal syncopal events
   surrounding non-invasive brain stimulation do occur. Thorough
   pre-screening should incorporate assessment of history of syncope and a
   plan for risk mitigation if such an event should occur. A complete
   assessment of the impact of stimulation on the autonomic nervous system
   is unknown. As such studies expand into patients with myriad neurologic
   diagnoses, further studies on this effect, in both healthy control and
   patient populations, are warranted. Such knowledge could contribute to
   identification of the optimal study participant, and improvements in
   techniques of stimulation administration.}},

Abstract = {{This paper develops a magnetic equivalent circuit model suitable to the
   design and optimization of the synchronous ac homopolar machine. The ac
   homopolar machine is of particular interest in the application of
   grid-based flywheel energy storage, where it has the potential to
   significantly reduce self-discharge associated with magnetic losses. The
   ac homopolar machine features both axial and radial magnetizing flux
   paths, which requires finite element analysis to be conducted in 3-D.
   The computation time associated with 3-D finite element modeling is
   highly prohibitive in the design process. The magnetic equivalent
   circuit model developed in this paper is shown to be a viable
   alternative for calculating several design performance parameters and
   has a computation time which is orders of magnitude less than that of
   3-D finite element analysis. Results obtained from the developed model
   are shown to be in good agreement with finite element and experimental
   results for varying levels of saturation.}},

   social network data, fit this paradigm. Prior work tackles this problem
   by iteratively selecting a fixed number of slabs and fitting, a
   procedure which may not converge. We formulate this problem from a
   group-sparsity promoting point of view, and propose an alternating
   optimization framework to handle the corresponding l(p) (0 < p <= 1)
   minimization-based low-rank tensor factorization problem. The proposed
   algorithm features a similar per-iteration complexity as the plain
   trilinear alternating least squares (TALS) algorithm. Convergence of the
   proposed algorithm is also easy to analyze under the framework of
   alternating optimization and its variants. In addition, regularization
   and constraints can be easily incorporated to make use of a priori
   information on the latent loading factors. Simulations and real data
   experiments on blind speech separation, fluorescence data analysis, and
   social network mining are used to showcase the effectiveness of the
   proposed algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that the organization of the fibers constituting a
   collagenous tissue can affect its failure behavior. Less clear is how
   that effect can be described computationally so as to predict the
   failure of a native or engineered tissue under the complex loading
   conditions that can occur in vivo. Toward the goal of a general
   predictive strategy, we applied our multiscale model of collagen gel
   mechanics to the failure of a double-notched gel under tension,
   comparing the results for aligned and isotropic samples. In both
   computational and laboratory experiments, we found that the aligned gels
   were more likely to fail by connecting the two notches than the
   isotropic gels. For example, when the initial notches were 30\% of the
   sample width (normalized tip-to-edge distance = 0.7), the normalized
   tip-to-tip distance at which the transition occurred from between-notch
   failure to across-sample failure shifted from 0.6 to 1.0. When the model
   predictions for the type of failure event (between the two notches
   versus across the sample width) were compared to the experimental
   results, the two were found to be strongly covariant by Fisher's exact
   test (p < 0.05) for both the aligned and isotropic gels with no fitting
   parameters. Although the double-notch system is idealized, and the
   collagen gel system is simpler than a true tissue, it presents a simple
   model system for studying failure of anisotropic tissues in a controlled
   setting. The success of the computational model suggests that the
   multiscale approach, in which the structural complexity is incorporated
   via changes in the model networks rather than via changes to a
   constitutive equation, has the potential to predict tissue failure under
   a wide range of conditions.}},

Title = {{Error Approximation in Mesoscale Material Property Field Representations}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Locally averaged random fields can be used to represent composite
   material properties at an intermediate scale. These types of fields
   provide the basis for stochastic simulation to generate nominally
   identical realizations of random composite microstructures to be used in
   reliability analysis. One challenge in choosing an appropriate local
   averaging technique and mesoscale length parameter is the difficulty of
   quantifying the accuracy of the locally averaged model. Although
   mesoscale models may offer advantages over the use of a representative
   volume element (RVE), particularly in regions of high stress gradients,
   mesoscale approximations do not converge to an effective medium, so the
   accuracy of the mesoscale representation cannot be quantified. In this
   paper, a matrix norm error is developed to test locally averaged
   material property approximations where loading is not specified a
   priori. This norm-based approach illustrates the advantage of local
   averaging over global averaging when small-scale variation in load may
   be present. This metric provides a basis for comparing locally averaged
   material property approximations of a benchmark composite
   microstructure. (c) 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF FLUID MECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{784}},
Pages = {{465-486}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Wetting of permeable substrates by liquids is an important phenomenon in
   many natural and industrial processes. Substrate heterogeneities may
   significantly alter liquid spreading and interface shapes, which in turn
   may alter liquid imbibition. A new lubrication-theory-based model for
   droplet spreading on permeable substrates that incorporates surface
   roughness is developed in this work. The substrate is assumed to be
   saturated with liquid, and the contact-line region is described by
   including a precursor film and disjoining pressure. A novel boundary
   condition for liquid imbibition is applied that eliminates the need for
   a droplet-thickness-dependent substrate permeability that has been
   employed in previous models. A nonlinear evolution equation describing
   droplet height as a function of time and the radial coordinate is
   derived and then numerically solved to characterize the influence of
   substrate permeability and roughness on axisymmetric droplet spreading.
   Because it incorporates surface roughness, the new model is able to
   describe the contact-line pinning that has been observed in experiments
   but not captured by previous models.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a design methodology to modularize integrated
   fixtures, such as automotive framing systems, to be quickly and cost
   effectively reconfigured to accommodate a variety of products.
   Automotive assembly framing systems are used to accurately position and
   spot-weld the loosely pre-assembled body-in-white (BIW) car body parts.
   Auto-assembly systems can handle many car body styles; however, the used
   model-specific BIW framing systems are large, expensive, and the
   changeover to accommodate different car models takes considerable time.
   The proposed modularization design methodology aggregates a set of
   design structure matrices (DSMs) to represent the required changes in
   the fixtures, the spatial relationships between the used tools and
   fixtures, and the flow of exchanged information between them. The best
   granularity level of the modular fixture design architecture is
   determined using ``Cladistics{''}: a hierarchical biological
   classification tool. Different tools within the framing system are
   combined into switchable modules, which allows these integrated systems
   to be easily reconfigured between different car body styles (product
   variants). A case study involving four car body styles is used for
   illustrating the presented design methodology. Results show the validity
   of the proposed methodology and demonstrate the obtained design of new
   modular automotive BIW framing system and the methods used for
   postprocessing and redesigning to improve the framing system's
   changeability.}},

   Needfinding: Effects of Expertise and Group Size}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Collecting data on user needs often results in a surfeit of candidate
   need statements. Additional analysis is necessary to prioritize a small
   subset for further consideration. Previous analytic methods have been
   used for small quantities (often fewer than 75 statements). This study
   presents a simplified quality metric and online interface appropriate to
   initially screen and prioritize lists exceeding 500 statements for a
   single topic or product area. Over 20,000 ratings for 1697 need
   statements across three common product areas were collected in 6 days. A
   series of hypotheses were tested: (1) Increasing the quantity of
   participants submitting needs increases the number of high-quality needs
   as judged by users; (2) increasing the quantity of needs contributed per
   person increases the number of high-quality needs as judged by users;
   and (3) increasing levels of self-rated user expertise will not
   significantly increase the number of high-quality needs per person. The
   results provided important quantitative evidence of fundamental
   relationships between the quantity and quality of need statements.
   Higher quantities of total needs submitted correlated to higher
   quantities of high-quality need statements both due to increasing group
   size and due to increasing counts per person using novel content-rich
   methods to help users articulate needs. Based on a multivariate
   analysis, a user's topic-specific expertise (self-rated) and experience
   level (self-rated hours per week) were not significantly associated with
   increasing quantities of high-quality needs.}},

Abstract = {{This study analyzed the relationship between electrophysiological
   responses to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), finger tracking
   accuracy, and volume of neural substrate in children with congenital
   hemiparesis. Nineteen participants demonstrating an ipsilesional
   motor-evoked potential (MEP) were compared with eleven participants

   tracking accuracy from the affected and less affected hands and
   ipsilesional/contralesional (I/C) volume ratio for the primary motor
   cortex (M1) and posterior limb of internal capsule (PLIC) were done
   using two-sample t-tests. Participants showing an ipsilesional MEP
   response demonstrated superior tracking performance from the less
   affected hand (p = 0.016) and significantly higher I/C volume ratios for
   M1 (p = 0.028) and PLIC (p = 0.005) compared to participants without an
   ipsilesional MEP response. Group differences in finger tracking accuracy
   from the affected hand were not significant. These results highlight
   differentiating factors amongst children with congenital hemiparesis
   showing contrasting MEP responses: less affected hand performance and
   preserved M1 and PLIC volume. Along with MEP status, these factors pose
   important clinical implications in pediatric stroke rehabilitation.
   These findings may also reflect competitive developmental processes
   associated with the preservation of affected hand function at the
   expense of some function in the less affected hand. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   short duration, high amplitude cyclical loading}},
Journal = {{ENGINEERING STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{104}},
Pages = {{116-125}},

Abstract = {{This study evaluates the behavior of monostrand post-tensioning
   anchorages under both monotonic and short duration high amplitude
   (post-yield) cyclical loading representative of use in self-centering
   structural applications designed to provide seismic resistance.
   Anchorages from two different manufacturers were tested in coupled and
   uncoupled configurations. In addition, a modified wedge geometry was
   evaluated to determine if the performance of the system could be
   improved. Strain within the strand was recorded using extensometers and
   strain gages for different samples. A detailed evaluation of the
   relationship between the strain within the strand and the elongation
   measured by the testing frame was conducted to ensure that the strain
   within the strand was calculated accurately throughout the tests. The
   results of this research indicate that the strain within the strand is
   not linearly related to the elongation recorded by the testing frame,
   and a more accurate method was developed to allow for this conversion.
   Additionally, it was determined that couplers did not significantly
   affect the capacity of the system, but the capacity was affected by the
   manufacturer of the anchorage system and the loading regime used to test

Title = {{The roles of Yb-substitution on thermoelectric properties of In4-xYbxSe3}},
Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{16-21}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Lead-free In4Se3 is a newly established promising middle temperature
   n-type thermoelectric (TE) material candidate. Series of Yb-substituted
   In4-xYbSe3 (x = 0.01-0.09) samples are prepared herein and their TE
   properties and the structure property relationship are investigated.
   Magnetic molar susceptibility measurements indicate that Yb is
   nonmagnetic. However, the Yb doped samples behave abnormally in
   transport properties. The unit cell volume variations and the carrier
   concentration (n(e)) changes reveal that Yb substitutes the In4+ site
   when x < 0.05 in the unitcell of In4Se3 and behaves in transport
   property as an +1 ion leading to a slow ne decrease; differently, Yb
   substitutes the In-3(5+) sites in the unitcell of In4Se3 when x > 0.05,
   and behaves as an acceptor leading to a sharp n(e) decline. These are
   considered to be attributed to the Fermi level pinning of the f and d
   orbitals of Yb. Such Yb substitution preference is also supported by our
   primary formation energy calculation. Besides, the carriers that on the
   pinning level are highly localized, thus contribute very little to the
   electrical conductivity, but contribute to some degree to the thermal
   conductivity as shown by property-temperature plots. In addition, the Yb
   atoms produce resonate states around E-F that enhance the Seebeck
   coefficient. As a heavy atom, Yb effectively scatter phonons resulting
   in the thermal conductivity reduction. All these factors together give
   In3.95Yb0.05Se3 a significant 30\% ZT at 703 K relevant to that of the
   pure In4Se3. (C) 2015 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Sensors are becoming ubiquitous in everyday life, generating data at an
   unprecedented rate and scale. However, models that assess impacts of
   human activities on environmental and human health, have typically been
   developed in contexts where data scarcity is the norm. Models are
   essential tools to understand processes, identify relationships,
   associations and causality, formalize stakeholder mental models, and to
   quantify the effects of prevention and interventions. They can help to
   explain data, as well as inform the deployment and location of sensors
   by identifying hotspots and areas of interest where data collection May
   achieve the best results. We identify a paradigm shift in how the
   integration of models and sensors can contribute to harnessing `Big
   Data' and, more importantly, make the vital step from `Big Data' to `Big
   Information'. In this paper, we illustrate current developments and
   identify key research needs using human and environmental health
   challenges as an example. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Angle-domain repetitive disturbances refer to disturbances that are
   periodic in a generic angle variable which is monotonically increasing
   with time but not uniformly. This paper extends the classical prototype
   repetitive control methodology for time periodic disturbances to this
   situation. Instead of using an internal model approach to derive the
   control, an affine parameterization approach is adopted which reduces
   the control design methodology to one of estimating and canceling the
   disturbance. While the resulting control architectures are similar to
   the classical time-domain periodic case, the stability conditions are
   different and depend on the choice of signal norm. This necessitates an
   alternate compensator design approach for the nonminimum phase terms.
   Robust stability is also considered in the L-2 setting and an affine
   Q-filter concept is introduced to achieve robust stability.}},

Abstract = {{We proposed and tested a method by which surface strains of biological
   tissues can be captured without the use of fiducial markers by instead,
   utilizing the inherent structure of the tissue. We used
   polarization-sensitive optical coherence tomography (PS OCT) to obtain
   volumetric data through the thickness and across a partial surface of
   the lumbar facet capsular ligament during three cases of static bending.
   Reflectivity and phase retardance were calculated from two polarization
   channels, and a power spectrum analysis was performed on each a-line to
   extract the dominant banding frequency (a measure of degree of fiber
   alignment) through the maximum value of the power spectrum (maximum
   power). Maximum powers of all a-lines for each case were used to create
   2D visualizations, which were subsequently tracked via digital image
   correlation. In-plane strains were calculated from measured 2D
   deformations and converted to 3D surface strains by including
   out-of-plane motion obtained from the PS OCT image. In-plane strains
   correlated with 3D strains (R (2) a parts per thousand yen 0.95). Using
   PS OCT for marker-free motion tracking of biological tissues is a
   promising new technique because it relies on the structural
   characteristics of the tissue to monitor displacement instead of
   external fiducial markers.}},

Abstract = {{As an effective approach for improving automobile fuel economy,
   powertrain hybridization has inspired extensive research efforts on
   system control and energy optimization. To convert the output of the
   energy management strategy into actual motion of the engine and the
   hybrid actuators (motor and generator), the hybrid powertrain controller
   decides to what extent the optimal operational trajectories of the
   engine and the hybrid actuators can be realized, so as to achieve the
   expected fuel efficiency and emissions benefit. To develop a hybrid
   powertrain controller with higher bandwidth and accuracy, this paper
   presents the design and experimental validation of a multivariable
   control framework for the power-split hybrid powertrain, as an
   improvement over the existing decoupled single-input, single-output
   (SISO) controller. First, the dynamic analysis characterizes the
   transient behavior (inverse transient dynamics) of the hybrid powertrain
   based on its unique physical structure, and reveals the inherent
   limitations of the SISO hybrid controls on transient engine operation
   (speed/torque tracking) due to the dynamic interactions among the
   multiple system variables and the electrical system constraints. Then,
   to solve this problem and further improve the transient engine operation
   tracking performance, a multivariable hybrid powertrain controller is
   designed to dynamically coordinate the engine torque and hybrid torques
   during transients, so as to flexibly manipulate the transient driving
   torque of the hybrid vehicle. To validate the proposed control design, a
   rapid-prototyping hybrid research platform with three-level control
   architecture is used. Experimental results show the multivariable hybrid
   powertrain control can produce a faster and balanced engine transient
   operation, with the moderate electric torque/power usage.}},

Title = {{The mass-mobility distributions of ions produced by a Po-210 source in

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AEROSOL SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{36-50}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{We utilized a differential mobility analyzer-mass spectrometer (DMA-MS)
   with a high resolving power (similar to 45) parallel plate DMA to
   measure the masses and mobilities of positive and negative ions
   generated in dry, particle free air with a 10 mCi Po-210 a-irradiation
   source. We are able to chemically identify 6 positive ions and 25
   negative ions in spectra. The positive ions detected were generated by
   protonation, and included protonated acetone (59 Da), protonated
   bis-(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (391 Da), and protonated cyclic
   polydimethylsiloxanes. The negative ions detected were all deprotonated,
   and included Teflon-derived perfluoralkanoate ions, long chain alcohol
   derived alkoxide ions, and the nitrate ion, which, despite its low mass
   and high mobility was the most abundant ion in negative spectra. Most
   detected ions can be traced back to system components or to compounds
   used in the manufacture of system components. Though clearly the
   detected ions are system specific, the conditions employed were similar
   to those used in many laboratory scale aerosol measurement systems. The
   mobility-mass relationship for measured ions was compared to prior
   mass-mobility measurements of ions produced via alpha a-irradiation, as
   well as to the predictions of gas molecule scattering calculations,
   which took as inputs semi-emipirical AM1 based structural models.
   Through this comparison we show that (1) a universal mobility mass
   relationship cannot be applied to all ions and (2) for most ions, gas
   molecule scattering with diffuse scattering rules can be used to
   accurately predict ion mobilities. Ion spectra collected with the same
   system but several months apart were also compared, demonstrating that
   although similar species are detected, the generated ion spectrum can
   vary over time. Finally, Brownian dynamics simulations with measured
   polydisperse ion properties were utilized to determine the expected
   steady-state charge distribution for particles exposed to the measured
   ions. Via simulations, we Find that the presence or absence of the
   negative nitrate ion has a strong effect on the steady-state charge
   distribution and that in most systems it is high concentrations of this
   ion (relative to others) which can bias charge distributions to negative
   polarity. Conversely, absence of the nitrate ion shifts charge
   distributions towards the positive mode. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{6-Month aortic valve implantation of an off-the-shelf tissue-engineered
   valve in sheep}},

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Diseased aortic valves often require replacement, with over 30\% of the
   current aortic valve surgeries performed in patients who will outlive a
   bioprosthetic valve. While many promising tissue-engineered valves have
   been created in the lab using the cell-seeded polymeric scaffold
   paradigm, none have been successfully tested long-term in the aortic
   position of a pre-clinical model. The high pressure gradients and
   dynamic flow across the aortic valve leaflets require engineering a
   tissue that has the strength and compliance to withstand high mechanical
   demand without compromising normal hemodynamics. A long-term preclinical
   evaluation of an off-the-shelf tissue-engineered aortic valve in the
   sheep model is presented here. The valves were made from a tube of
   decellularized cell-produced matrix mounted on a frame. The engineered
   matrix is primarily composed of collagen, with strength and organization
   comparable to native valve leaflets. In vitro testing showed excellent
   hemodynamic performance with low regurgitation, low systolic pressure
   gradient, and large orifice area. The implanted valves showed
   large-scale leaflet motion and maintained effective orifice area
   throughout the duration of the 6-month implant, with no calcification.
   After 24 weeks implantation (over 17 million cycles), the valves showed
   no change in tensile mechanical properties. In addition, histology and
   DNA quantitation showed repopulation of the engineered matrix with
   interstitial-like cells and endothelialization. New extracellular matrix
   deposition, including elastin, further demonstrates positive tissue
   remodeling in addition to recellularization and valve function.
   Long-term implantation in the sheep model resulted in functionality,
   matrix remodeling, and recellularization, unprecedented results for a
   tissue-engineered aortic valve. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{In this work, Chlorella sp. (UM6151) was selected to treat meat
   processing wastewater for nutrient removal and biomass production. To
   balance the nutrient profile and improve biomass yield at low cost, an
   innovative algae cultivation model based on wastewater mixing was
   developed. The result showed that biomass yield (0.675-1.538 g/L) of
   algae grown on mixed wastewater was much higher than that on individual
   wastewater and artificial medium. Wastewater mixing eased the bottleneck
   for algae growth and contributed to the improved biomass yield.
   Furthermore, in mixed wastewater with sufficient nitrogen, ammonia
   nitrogen removal efficiencies (68.75-90.38\%) and total nitrogen removal
   efficiencies (30.06-50.94\%) were improved. Wastewater mixing also
   promoted the synthesis of protein in algal cells. Protein content of
   algae growing on mixed wastewater reached 60.87-68.65\%, which is much
   higher than that of traditional protein source. Algae cultivation model
   based on wastewater mixing is an efficient and economical way to improve
   biomass yield. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A large-eddy simulation framework, dubbed as the Virtual Wind Simulator
   (VWiS), for simulating turbulent flow over wind turbines and wind farms
   in complex terrain is developed and validated. The wind turbines are
   parameterized using the actuator line model. The complex terrain is
   represented by the curvilinear immersed boundary method. The predictive
   capability of the present method is evaluated by simulating two
   available wind tunnel experimental cases: the flow over a stand-alone
   turbine and an aligned wind turbine array. Systematic grid refinement
   studies are carried out, for both single turbine and multi-turbine array
   cases, and the accuracy of the computed results is assessed through
   detailed comparisons with wind tunnel experiments. The model is further
   applied to simulate the flow over an operational utility-scale wind
   farm. The inflow velocities for this case are interpolated from a
   mesoscale simulation using a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
   model with and without adding synthetic turbulence to the WRF-computed
   velocity fields. Improvements on power predictions are obtained when
   synthetic turbulence is added at the inlet. Finally the VWiS is applied
   to simulate a yet undeveloped wind farm at a complex terrain site where
   wind resource measurements have already been obtained. Good agreement
   with field measurements is obtained in terms of the time-averaged
   streamwise velocity profiles. To demonstrate the ability of the model to
   simulate the interactions of terrain-induced turbulence with wind
   turbines, eight hypothetical turbines are placed in this area. The
   computed extracted power underscores the significant effect of
   site-specific topography on turbine performance. Copyright (c) 2014 John

Abstract = {{The specific energy of electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs)
   can be increased by design of the pore architecture to provide large
   interfaces between electrodes and electrolyte and efficient access to
   these surfaces. Colloidal-crystal templated carbon electrodes with
   interconnected, uniform mesopores have demonstrated high capacitances at
   fast charge/discharge rates in EDLCs used with ionic liquid
   electrolytes. Here we aim to enhance capacitive performance further
   through nitrogen doping, by combining a phenol-formaldehyde precursor
   with the ionic liquid (IL) 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanoamide
   (EMI-DCA) as the nitrogen source. The IL content in this precursor
   affects the resistance, structural integrity, and specific capacitance
   of the porous electrodes. With an IL content up to 50 wt\%, the
   electrode resistance is reduced while the bicontinuous mesoporous
   structure of the resulting carbon is preserved. The specific capacitance
   of an electrode prepared with 50\% IL in the precursor increases over
   40\% at 10 A g(-1) compared to mesoporous carbons prepared using only
   the phenolformaldehyde resol. With an ionic liquid electrolyte, the
   maximum specific capacitance is 237 F g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1), and a
   specific capacitance of at least 195 F g(-1) is maintained after 1000
   cycles at 1 A g(-1). A higher IL content in the precursor results in
   reduced structural order and capacitive performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{We give a mathematical analysis of a concept of metastability induced by
   incompatibility. The physical setting is a single parent phase, just
   about to undergo transformation to a product phase of lower energy
   density. Under certain conditions of incompatibility of the energy wells
   of this energy density, we show that the parent phase is metastable in a
   strong sense, namely it is a local minimizer of the free energy in an L
   (1) neighbourhood of its deformation. The reason behind this result is
   that, due to the incompatibility of the energy wells, a small nucleus of
   the product phase is necessarily accompanied by a stressed transition
   layer whose energetic cost exceeds the energy lowering capacity of the
   nucleus. We define and characterize incompatible sets of matrices, in
   terms of which the transition layer estimate at the heart of the proof
   of metastability is expressed. Finally we discuss connections with
   experiments and place this concept of metastability in the wider context
   of recent theoretical and experimental research on metastability and
   hysteresis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider an online matching problem with concave returns. This
   problem is a generalization of the traditional online matching problem
   and has vast applications in online advertising. In this work, we
   propose a dynamic learning algorithm that achieves near-optimal
   performance for this problem when the inputs arrive in a random order
   and satisfy certain conditions. The key idea of our algorithm is to
   learn the input data pattern dynamically: we solve a sequence of
   carefully chosen partial allocation problems and use their optimal
   solutions to assist with the future decisions. Our analysis belongs to
   the primal-dual paradigm; however, the absence of linearity of the
   objective function and the dynamic feature of the algorithm makes our
   analysis quite unique. We also show through numerical experiments that
   our algorithm performs well for test data. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. and

Title = {{Spherical statistics for characterizing the spatial distribution of deep
   brain stimulation effects on neuronal activity}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{255}},
Pages = {{52-65}},
Month = {{NOV 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Computational models of deep brain stimulation (DBS) have
   played a key role in understanding its physiological mechanisms. By
   estimating a volume of tissue directly modulated by DBS, one can relate
   the neuronal pathways within those volumes to the therapeutic efficacy
   of a particular DBS setting.
   New method: A spherical statistical framework is described to quantify
   and determine salient features of such morphologies using visualization
   techniques, empirical shape analysis, and formal hypothesis testing.
   This framework is shown using a 3D model of thalamocortical neurons
   surrounding a radially-segmented DBS array.
   Results: We show that neuronal population volumes modulated by various
   DBS electrode configurations can be characterized by parametric
   distribution models, such as Kent and Watson girdle models. Distribution
   parameters were found to change with stimulus settings, including
   amplitude and radial distance from the DBS array. Increasing stimulation
   amplitude through a single electrode resulted in more diffuse neuronal
   activation and increased rotational symmetry about the mean direction of
   the activated population. When stimulation amplitude was held constant,
   the activated neuronal population distribution was more concentrated
   with distance from the DBS array and was also more rotationally
   asymmetric. We also show how data representation (e.g.
   stimulus-entrained cell body vs. axon node) can significantly alter
   model distribution shape. Comparison to existing methods: This
   statistical framework provides a quantitative method.to analyze the
   spatial morphologies of DBS-induced effects on neuronal activity.
   Conclusions: The application of spherical statistics to assess spatial
   distributions of neuronal activity has potential usefulness for numerous
   other recording, labeling, and stimulation modalities. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Endocardial access to the left atrium is commonly achieved to treat
   patients with atrial fibrillation, using different device delivery
   systems for cardiac ablation. But the large variation in human anatomy
   presses the limits of existing medical devices. In this unique study, we
   directly visualized the device-tissue interface in fresh reanimated
   human hearts using Visible Heart (R) methodologies. Our goal was to
   better understand any opportunities to improve therapeutic approaches.
   The visual images obtained in this study (also featured in this article)
   allow a more intimate grasp of the key steps required in various
   ablation procedures, as well as some limitations of current device
   designs. These images show the potential risks of conducting transseptal
   punctures and the difficulties of placing catheter tips in certain
   scenarios (e.g., when creating circumferential lesions); they also
   demonstrate potential problems that could occur while attempting to
   place catheter tips on such anatomies like the mitral isthmus. In our
   analysis of these images, we focus on where enhancements are needed to

Abstract = {{We report a combined experimental and theoretical study of the
   relationship between the surface structure of silicon nanocrystals
   synthesized in a nonthermal plasma reactor and their photoluminescence
   (PL) yields. Upon heating to 160 degrees C, a significant change in the
   SiH stretch region of the vibrational spectrum is observed indicating a
   decrease in surface SiH3 groups, which correlates with an increase in
   the PL yield. Effusion of SiHx and Si2H2x from the material is detected
   by residual gas analysis upon heating to temperatures below 200 degrees
   C, suggesting a weakly bound species. Analysis of electron paramagnetic
   resonance spectra before and after heating points to a small reduction
   in the density of dangling bonds upon heating but this reduction does
   not correlate with the increase in PL yield. Electronic structure
   calculations indicate that SiH3 groups may hypervalently bond to fully
   coordinated surface silicon atoms, resulting in a relatively weak (0.70
   eV) bond that is consistent with the experimentally observed effusion at
   low temperature. Furthermore, nonadiabatic molecular dynamics
   simulations indicate that such hypervalent silyl defects provide
   efficient pathways for nonradiative recombination via conical
   intersections that are energetically accessible after near-infrared
   excitation.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the interactions of ambient molecules with graphene and
   adjacent dielectrics is of fundamental importance for a range of
   graphene-based devices, particularly sensors, where such interactions
   could influence the operation of the device. It is well-known that water
   can be trapped underneath graphene and its host substrate; however, the
   electrical effect of water beneath graphene and the dynamics of how the
   interfacial water changes with different ambient conditions has not been
   quantified. Here, using a metal-oxide-graphene variable-capacitor
   (varactor) structure, we show that graphene can be used to capacitively
   sense the intercalation of water between graphene and HfO2 and that this
   process is reversible on a fast time scale. Atomic force microscopy is
   used to confirm the intercalation and quantify the displacement of
   graphene as a function of humidity. Density functional theory
   simulations are used to quantify the displacement of graphene induced by
   intercalated water and also explain the observed Dirac point shifts as
   being due to the combined effect of water and oxygen on the carrier
   concentration in the graphene. Finally, molecular dynamics simulations
   indicate that a likely mechanism for the intercalation involves
   adsorption and lateral diffusion of water molecules beneath the
   graphene.}},

Abstract = {{APOBEC3B is a newly identified source of mutation in many cancers,
   including breast, head/neck, lung, bladder, cervical, and ovarian.
   APOBEC3B is a member of the APOBEC3 family of enzymes that deaminate DNA
   cytosine to produce the promutagenic lesion, uracil. Several APOBEC3
   family members function to restrict virus replication. For instance,
   APOBEC3D, APOBEC3F, APOBEC3G, and APOBEC3H combine to restrict HIV-1 in
   human lymphocytes. HIV-1 counteracts these APOBEC3s with the viral
   protein Vif, which targets the relevant APOBEC3s for proteasomal
   degradation. While APOBEC3B does not restrict HIV-1 and is not targeted
   by HIV-1 Vif in CD4-positive T cells, we asked whether related
   lentiviral Vif proteins could degrade APOBEC3B. Interestingly, several
   SIV Vif proteins are capable of promoting APOBEC3B degradation, with
   SIVmac239 Vif proving the most potent. This likely occurs through the
   canonical polyubiquitination mechanism as APOBEC3B protein levels are
   restored by MG132 treatment and by altering a conserved E3
   ligase-binding motif. We further show that SIVmac239 Vif can prevent
   APOBEC3B mediated geno/cytotoxicity and degrade endogenous APOBEC3B in
   several cancer cell lines. Our data indicate that the APOBEC3B
   degradation potential of SIV Vif is an effective tool for neutralizing
   the cancer genomic DNA deaminase APOBEC3B. Further optimization of this
   natural APOBEC3 antagonist may benefit cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{The interfacial tension between polystyrene (PS) and polybutadiene (PB)
   homopolymers is measured in the presence of a nearly symmetric
   poly(styrene-b-butadiene) (SB) copolymer and compared to independent
   measurements of the critical micelle concentration (CMC) by transmission
   electron microscopy (TEM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and
   to self-consistent field theory (SCFT) predictions. Interfacial tension
   is measured with a spinning drop tensiometer (SDT) containing a drop of
   PB in a PS matrix, using samples in which varying concentrations of SB
   copolymer were initially added to either PS or PB. When SB is premixed
   with PS, the dependence of the interfacial tension gamma upon copolymer
   concentration c is qualitatively similar to that expected in
   equilibrium, showing a decrease of gamma with increasing c for c less
   than an apparent CMC and then saturating at higher concentrations. TEM
   and SAXS studies of a binary mixture of the same copolymer and PS
   homopolymer show, however, that the true CMC in PS is much lower than
   the apparent CMC inferred from these SDT experiments. We analyze the
   role of transport limitations in this experiment and propose that this
   discrepancy may be a result of a suppressed copolymer chemical potential
   near the interface due to continual diffusion of copolymer into the PB
   drop.}},

Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations are performed for two model
   pressure-sensitive adhesive (PSA) materials, atactic poly(n-butyl
   acrylate) {[}poly(n-BA)] and atactic poly(n-butyl acrylate-co-acrylic
   acid) {[}poly(n-BA-co-AA)] at a very low concentration in acrylic acid
   (one acrylic acid monomer per fifty butyl acrylate monomers plus three
   acrylic acids at each one of the two chain ends) in the bulk and
   confined between three crystalline substrates, silica (SiO2) represented
   as alpha-quartz, alpha-ferric oxide (alpha-Fe2O3), and metallic
   alpha-ferrite (alpha-Fe), over a range of temperatures. The simulations
   are carried out with the accurate, all-atom Dreiding force-field and
   provide important information for the distribution of local mass density
   of the two polymers at the three crystalline substrates, and their
   adsorption in conformations that lead to the formation of loop, train,
   and tail structures. By analyzing potential energy interactions between
   the two polymers and each one of the three substrates through their van
   der Waals contact area or by computing the diagonal elements of the
   local stress tensor in the vicinity of the substrate, we have calculated
   the effect of the type of substrate on the work of adhesion of the two
   polymers. Our calculations reveal a considerably stronger adsorption on
   alpha-quartz and alpha-ferric oxide compared to alpha-ferrite, which we
   attribute to strong attractive oxygen interactions of the two polymers
   with the oxygen atoms of SiO2 and Fe2O3. Detailed calculations of the
   local number density distribution of individual atomic species above the
   three substrates, of the local variation of the bond order parameter for
   skeletal and side group bonds or chords, of the distribution of dihedral
   angles, and of the histograms of chain ends support that the two PSAs
   adsorb on the three substrates with both their skeletal and pendant C-C
   and C-O groups lying practically parallel to the surface and in such a
   way that the C=O bond of the pendant butyl acrylate groups points toward
   the surface. The detailed MD simulations indicate that adding a small
   amount (7.1\% wt. here) of acrylic acid to poly(n-BA) significantly
   improves its wetting characteristics on oxygen-containing substrates.
   This is in full support of the findings of Kisin et al. {[}Chem. Mater.
   2007, 19, 903-907] that introducing oxygen atoms to a metallic surface
   or to polymer molecules increases considerably the work of adhesion.}},

Abstract = {{Metastasis is the process by which cells from a primary tumor disperse
   and form new tumors at distant anatomical locations. The treatment and
   prevention of metastatic cancer remains an extremely challenging
   problem. This work introduces a novel biologically motivated objective
   function to the radiation optimization community that takes into account
   metastatic risk instead of the status of the primary tumor. In this
   work, we consider the problem of developing fractionated irradiation
   schedules that minimize production of metastatic cancer cells while
   keeping normal tissue damage below an acceptable level. A dynamic
   programming framework is utilized to determine the optimal fractionation
   scheme. We evaluated our approach on a breast cancer case using the
   heart and the lung as organs-at-risk (OAR). For small tumor alpha/beta
   values, hypo-fractionated schedules were optimal, which is consistent
   with standard models. However, for relatively larger alpha/beta values,
   we found the type of schedule depended on various parameters such as the
   time when metastatic risk was evaluated, the alpha/beta values of the
   OARs, and the normal tissue sparing factors. Interestingly, in contrast
   to standard models, hypo-fractionated and semi-hypo-fractionated
   schedules (large initial doses with doses tapering off with time) were
   suggested even with large tumor alpha/beta values. Numerical results
   indicate the potential for significant reduction in metastatic risk.}},

   production}},
Journal = {{ENERGY CONVERSION AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{105}},
Pages = {{900-907}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Sub-azeotropic hydrous ethanol has been demonstrated as an effective
   diesel fuel replacement when used in dual-fuel compression ignition
   engines. Previous studies have also suggested that hydrous ethanol may
   be more efficient to produce from corn than anhydrous ethanol. In this
   study, we investigate corn ethanol production from a dry-mill, natural
   gas-fired corn ethanol refinery, producing ethanol with a range of
   ethanol concentrations from 58 wt\% to 100 wt\% to determine the effect
   on energy use, water consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in
   the refining stage of the corn ethanol lifecycle. A second law (exergy)
   analysis of anhydrous ethanol refining revealed the overall process to
   be 70\% efficient, whereby 86\% of the exergy losses could be accounted
   for by three processes: fermentation (34\%), steam generation (29\%) and
   distiller's grains and solubles drying (23\%).
   We found that producing 86 wt\% ethanol is optimal as thermal energy
   consumption decreases by a maximum of 10\% (from 7.7 MJ/L to 6.9 MJ/L).
   These savings have the potential to reduce energy costs by approximately
   8\% (\$0.34/0 and reduce refinery emissions by 8\% (2 g CO(2)e/MJ).
   Production of hydrous ethanol reduced refinery water use due to
   decreased evaporative losses in the cooling towers, leading to water
   savings of between 3\% and 6\% at 86 wt\% ethanol. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Anhydrous ethanol has been widely investigated as an alternative fuel
   for internal combustion engines. The use of high water content hydrous
   ethanol in engines has the potential to significantly improve life-cycle
   energy use and CO2 emissions of bio-ethanol. Our previous work showed
   that dual-fuel reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI)
   combustion is a promising combustion strategy replacing up to 80\% of
   the total fuel energy with hydrous ethanol yielding simultaneously high
   thermal efficiency and low engine-out NOX and soot emissions. In this
   work, we use response surface methodology (RSM) to experimentally
   optimize several key engine engine-out emissions parameters at high and
   low engine load with data from a single-cylinder research engine.
   Efficient experimental designs were developed that allowed
   identification of statistically significant operating parameters for
   optimizing emissions. Following the optimization path generated by the
   RSM, NOX and soot emissions were reduced by 79\% and 50\% at the low
   load condition, and by 72\% and 27\% at the high load condition,
   compared to the starting points. Indicated thermal efficiency was
   compromised along the optimization path due to delayed combustion
   phasing for both load conditions. The study also shows that different
   operating parameters are significant for RCCI emissions at different
   engine loads. A trade-off between HC and CO emissions was observed at
   the lower load condition, while HC and CO were both lower after the
   optimization process at the higher load condition. Overall, this work
   shows that RSM can be effectively used to elucidate interactions among
   multiple engine operating parameters with reduced experimentation to
   optimize complex dual-fuel RCCI combustion modes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{In this study, fast microwave-assisted catalytic co-pyrolysis of
   microalgae and scum on HZSM-5 catalyst for bio-oil production was
   investigated. The effects of co-pyrolysis temperature, catalyst to feed
   ratio, and microalgae to scum ratio on bio-oil yield and composition
   were examined. Experimental results show that temperature had great
   influence on the co-pyrolysis process. The optimal temperature was 550
   degrees C since the maximum bio-oil yield and highest proportion of
   aromatic hydrocarbons in the bio-oil were obtained at this temperature.
   The bio-oil yield decreased when catalyst was used, but the production
   of aromatic hydrocarbons was significantly promoted when the catalyst to
   feed ratio increased from 1:1 to 2:1. Co-feeding of scum could improve
   the bio-oil and aromatics production, while the optimal microalgae to
   scum ratio was 1:2 from the perspective of bio-oil quality. The
   synergistic effect between microalgae and scum during the co-pyrolysis
   process became significant only when the effective hydrogen index (EHI)
   of feedstock was larger than about 0.7. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The major type of human liver cancer is hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
   and there are currently many risk factors that contribute to this deadly
   disease. The majority of HCC occurrences are associated with chronic
   hepatitis viral infection, and hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is
   currently a major health problem in Eastern Asia. Elucidating the
   genetic mechanisms associated with HBV-induced HCC has been difficult
   due to the heterogeneity and genetic complexity associated with this
   disease. A repertoire of animal models has been broadly used to study
   the pathophysiology and to develop potential treatment regimens for
   HBV-associated HCC. The use of these animal models has provided valuable
   genetic information and has been an important contributor to uncovering
   the factors involved in liver malignant transformation, invasion and
   metastasis. Recently, transposon-based mouse models are becoming more
   widely used in liver cancer research to interrogate the genome by
   forward genetics and also used to validate genes rapidly in a reverse
   genetic manner. Importantly, these transposon-based rapid reverse
   genetic mouse models could become crucial in testing potential
   therapeutic agents before proceeding to clinical trials in human.
   Therefore, this review will cover the use of transposon- based mouse
   models to address the problems of liver cancer, especially
   HBV-associated HCC occurrences in Asia.}},

Title = {{Controlling microbial contamination during hydrolysis of AFEX-pretreated
   corn stover and switchgrass: effects on hydrolysate composition,
   microbial response and fermentation}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{NOV 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbial conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks into
   biofuels remains an attractive means to produce sustainable energy. It
   is essential to produce lignocellulosic hydrolysates in a consistent
   manner in order to study microbial performance in different feedstock
   hydrolysates. Because of the potential to introduce microbial
   contamination from the untreated biomass or at various points during the
   process, it can be difficult to control sterility during hydrolysate
   production. In this study, we compared hydrolysates produced from
   AFEX-pretreated corn stover and switchgrass using two different methods
   to control contamination: either by autoclaving the pretreated
   feedstocks prior to enzymatic hydrolysis, or by introducing antibiotics
   during the hydrolysis of non-autoclaved feedstocks. We then performed
   extensive chemical analysis, chemical genomics, and comparative
   fermentations to evaluate any differences between these two different
   methods used for producing corn stover and switchgrass hydrolysates.
   Results: Autoclaving the pretreated feedstocks could eliminate the
   contamination for a variety of feedstocks, whereas the antibiotic
   gentamicin was unable to control contamination consistently during
   hydrolysis. Compared to the addition of gentamicin, autoclaving of
   biomass before hydrolysis had a minimal effect on mineral
   concentrations, and showed no significant effect on the two major sugars
   (glucose and xylose) found in these hydrolysates. However, autoclaving
   elevated the concentration of some furanic and phenolic compounds.
   Chemical genomics analyses using Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains
   indicated a high correlation between the AFEX-pretreated hydrolysates
   produced using these two methods within the same feedstock, indicating
   minimal differences between the autoclaving and antibiotic methods.
   Comparative fermentations with S. cerevisiae and Zymomonas mobilis also
   showed that autoclaving the AFEX-pretreated feedstocks had no
   significant effects on microbial performance in these hydrolysates.
   Conclusions: Our results showed that autoclaving the pretreated
   feedstocks offered advantages over the addition of antibiotics for
   hydrolysate production. The autoclaving method produced a more
   consistent quality of hydrolysate, and also showed negligible effects on
   microbial performance. Although the levels of some of the lignocellulose
   degradation inhibitors were elevated by autoclaving the feedstocks prior
   to enzymatic hydrolysis, no significant effects on cell growth, sugar
   utilization, or ethanol production were seen during bacterial or yeast
   fermentations in hydrolysates produced using the two different methods.}},

Abstract = {{Selective removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) from sour natural gas
   mixtures is one of the key challenges facing the natural gas industry.
   Adsorption and pervaporation processes utilizing nanoporous materials,
   such as zeolites, can be alternatives to highly energy-intensive
   amine-based absorption processes. In this work, the adsorption behavior
   of binary mixtures containing H2S and methane (CH4) in seven different
   all-silica zeolite frameworks (CHA, DDR, PER, IFR, MFI, MOR, and MWW) is
   investigated using Gibbs ensemble Monte Carlo simulations at two
   temperatures (298 and 343 K) and pressures ranging from 1 to 50 bar. The
   simulations demonstrate high selectivities that, with the exception of
   MOR, increase with increasing H2S concentration due to favorable
   sorbate-sorbate interactions. The simulations indicate significant
   inaccuracies of predictions using unary adsorption data and ideal
   adsorbed solution theory. In addition, the adsorption of binary H2S/H2O
   mixtures in MFI is considered to probe whether the presence of H2S
   induces coadsorption and reduces the hydrophobic character of all-silica
   zeolites. The simulations show preferential adsorption of H2S from moist
   gases with a selectivity of about 18 over H2O.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Low back pain exerts a tremendous burden on individual
   patients and society due to its prevalence and ability to cause
   long-term disability. Contemporary treatment and prevention efforts are
   stymied by the absence of a confirmed cause for the majority of low back
   pain patients.
   Methods: A system dynamics approach is used to build a
   physiologically-based model investigating the relationship between disc
   degeneration and low back pain. The model's predictions are evaluated
   under two different types of study designs and compared with established
   observations on low back pain.
   Results: A three-compartment model (no disc degeneration, disc
   degeneration with pain remission, disc degeneration with pain
   recurrence) accurately predicts the age-specific prevalence observed in
   one of the largest population-based surveys (R-2 = 0.998). The estimated
   transition age at which intervertebral discs lose the growth potential
   and begin degenerating is 13.3 years. The estimated disc degeneration
   rate is 0.0344/year. Without any additional change being made to
   parameter's values, the model also fully accounts for the age-specific
   prevalence of disc degeneration detected with a lumbar MRI among
   asymptomatic individuals (R-2 = 0.978).
   Conclusions: Dual testing of the proposed mechanistic model with two
   independent data sources (one with lumbar MRI and the other without)
   confirm that disc degeneration is the driving force behind and cause of
   age dependence in low back pain. Observed complexity of low back pain
   epidemiology arises from the slow dynamics of disc degeneration coupled
   with the fast dynamics of disease recurrence.}},

Title = {{High-frequency, precise modification of the tomato genome}},
Journal = {{GENOME BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{NOV 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: The use of homologous recombination to precisely modify
   plant genomes has been challenging, due to the lack of efficient methods
   for delivering DNA repair templates to plant cells. Even with the advent
   of sequence-specific nucleases, which stimulate homologous recombination
   at predefined genomic sites by creating targeted DNA double-strand
   breaks, there are only a handful of studies that report precise editing
   of endogenous genes in crop plants. More efficient methods are needed to
   modify plant genomes through homologous recombination, ideally without
   randomly integrating foreign DNA.
   Results: Here, we use geminivirus replicons to create heritable
   modifications to the tomato genome at frequencies tenfold higher than
   traditional methods of DNA delivery (i.e., Agrobacterium). A strong
   promoter was inserted upstream of a gene controlling anthocyanin
   biosynthesis, resulting in overexpression and ectopic accumulation of
   pigments in tomato tissues. More than two-thirds of the insertions were
   precise, and had no unanticipated sequence modifications. Both TALENs
   and CRISPR/Cas9 achieved gene targeting at similar efficiencies.
   Further, the targeted modification was transmitted to progeny in a
   Mendelian fashion. Even though donor molecules were replicated in the
   vectors, no evidence was found of persistent extra-chromosomal replicons
   or off-target integration of T-DNA or replicon sequences.
   Conclusions: High-frequency, precise modification of the tomato genome
   was achieved using geminivirus replicons, suggesting that these vectors
   can overcome the efficiency barrier that has made gene targeting in
   plants challenging. This work provides a foundation for efficient genome
   editing of crop genomes without the random integration of foreign DNA.}},

Abstract = {{A characteristic feature of mitotic spindles is the congression of
   chromosomes near the spindle equator, a process mediated by dynamic
   kinetochore microtubules. A major challenge is to understand how
   precise, submicrometer-scale control of kinetochore micro-tubule
   dynamics is achieved in the smallest mitotic spindles, where the
   noisiness of microtubule assembly/disassembly will potentially act to
   overwhelm the spatial information that controls microtubule plus end-tip
   positioning to mediate congression. To better understand this
   fundamental limit, we conducted an integrated live fluorescence,
   electron microscopy, and modeling analysis of the polymorphic fungal
   pathogen Candida albicans, which contains one of the smallest known
   mitotic spindles (<1 mu m). Previously, ScCin8p (kinesin-5 in
   Saccharomyces cerevisiae) was shown to mediate chromosome congression by
   promoting catastrophe of long kinetochore microtubules (kMTs). Using C.
   albicans yeast and hyphal kinesin-5 (Kip1p) heterozygotes (KIP1/kip1
   Delta), we found that mutant spindles have longer kMTs than wild-type
   spindles, consistent with a less-organized spindle. By contrast,
   kinesin-8 heterozygous mutant (KIP3/kip3 Delta) spindles exhibited the
   same spindle organization as wild type. Of interest, spindle
   organization in the yeast and hyphal states was indistinguishable, even
   though yeast and hyphal cell lengths differ by two- to fivefold,
   demonstrating that spindle length regulation and chromosome congression
   are intrinsic to the spindle and largely independent of cell size.
   Together these results are consistent with a kinesin-5-mediated,
   length-dependent depolymerase activity that organizes chromosomes at the
   spindle equator in C. albicans to overcome fundamental noisiness in
   microtubule self-assembly. More generally, we define a dimensionless
   number that sets a fundamental physical limit for maintaining
   congression in small spindles in the face of assembly noise and find
   that C. albicans operates very close to this limit, which may explain
   why it has the smallest known mitotic spindle that still manifests the
   classic congression architecture.}},

Title = {{Convective heat transfer enhancement versus disenhancement: Impact of
   fluid-mover characteristics}},
Journal = {{APPLIED THERMAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{90}},
Pages = {{242-249}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Methods of enhancing heat transfer rates have primarily been based on
   geometrical modifications and supplementations of basic heat transfer
   devices. To evaluate the extent of the enhancement (or of a possible
   disenhancement), it has been traditional to compare the heat transfer
   performance of the basic and the enhanced devices under certain
   constraints. Seemingly, the most popular among the constraints is that
   both the compared devices be operated at the same pumping power. Other
   popular conditions of constraint include operation at the same pressure
   drop, mass flow rate, device volume, heat transfer area, temperature
   difference, and many others. Noteworthy by its absence from
   consideration as a major factor in affecting the degree of enhancement
   is the fluid mover that serves to deliver fluid flow to the heat
   transfer device. The characteristic operating curve of a fluid mover
   relates its pressure rise to the volumetric flow rate that it provides.
   The shape of the curve that represents this relationship varies widely
   among individual fluid movers as well as among different generic types
   of fluid movers. In the present investigation, the essential role of
   fluid-mover operating characteristics in affecting heat transfer
   enhancement is presented and implemented. A case study involving surface
   geometry enhancement by means of louvered fins is considered along with
   its unenhanced plain-fin counterpart. For generality, two distinctly
   different fluid movers are utilized as means of fluid delivery to both
   the enhanced and unenhanced heat transfer devices. For both of the fluid
   movers, it was found that the enhanced geometry actually led to a
   reduction in the rate of heat transfer while giving rise to an increase
   in pressure drop. It was also shown that enhancement (or disenhancement)
   depends as much on the characteristics of the fluid mover as it does on
   the geometry of the heat transfer device in question. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Decitabine has previously been shown to induce lethal mutagenesis of
   human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, the factors that
   determine the susceptibilities of individual sequence positions in HIV-1
   to decitabine have not yet been defined. To investigate this, we
   performed Illumina high-throughput sequencing of multiple amplicons
   prepared from proviral DNA that was recovered from decitabine-treated
   cells infected with HIV-1. We found that decitabine induced an
   approximate to 4.1-fold increase in the total mutation frequency of
   HIV-1, primarily due to a striking approximate to 155-fold increase in
   the G-to-C transversion frequency. Intriguingly, decitabine also led to
   an approximate to 29-fold increase in the C-to-G transversion frequency.
   G-to-C frequencies varied substantially (up to approximate to 80-fold)
   depending upon sequence position, but surprisingly, mutational hot spots
   (defined as upper outliers within the mutation frequency distribution)
   were not observed. We further found that every single guanine position
   examined was significantly susceptible to the mutagenic effects of
   decitabine. Taken together, these observations demonstrate for the first
   time that decitabine-mediated HIV-1 mutagenesis is promiscuous and
   occurs in the absence of a clear bias for mutational hot spots. These
   data imply that decitabine-mediated G-to-C mutagenesis is a highly
   effective antiviral mechanism for extinguishing HIV-1 infectivity.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances have allowed semi-synthetic production of complex
   pharmaceutical compounds and commodity chemicals by combining chemical
   and biological approaches. This approach offers several advantages
   including synthesis of chirally pure precursors for drugs, design of
   greener and more sustainable production routes for commodity chemicals
   by eliminating the use of hazardous chemicals and generation of waste
   and improving overall process efficiencies by reducing total number of
   steps involved in synthesis. In this review, we will discuss in detail
   the synthesis of three pharmaceuticals simvastatin, artemisinin, and
   warfarin - and two commodity chemicals - beta-methyl-delta-valerolactone
   and butadiene, all of which have wide applications in the pharmaceutical
   and polymer industry.}},

Title = {{Measurements of DNA barcode label separations in nanochannels from
   time-series data}},
Journal = {{BIOMICROFLUIDICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{We analyzed time-series data for fluctuations of intramolecular segments
   of barcoded E. coli genomic DNA molecules confined in nanochannels with
   sizes near the persistence length of DNA. These dynamic data allowed us
   to measure the probability distribution governing the distance between
   labels on the DNA backbone, which is a key input into the alignment
   methods used for genome mapping in nanochannels. Importantly, this
   dynamic method does not require alignment of the barcode to the
   reference genome, thereby removing a source of potential systematic
   error in a previous study of this type. The results thus obtained
   support previous evidence for a left-skewed probability density for the
   distance between labels, albeit at a lower magnitude of skewness. We
   further show that the majority of large fluctuations between labels are
   short-lived events, which sheds further light upon the success of the
   linearized DNA genome mapping technique. This time-resolved data
   analysis will improve existing genome map alignment algorithms, and the
   overall idea of using dynamic data could potentially improve the
   accuracy of genome mapping, especially for complex heterogeneous samples
   such as cancer cells. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{A size-dependent evolution of phonon confinement is revealed in Si
   nanoparticles (NPs) via Raman spectroscopy. By introducing a variable
   confinement factor, alpha, into a well-known phenomenological phonon
   confinement model (PCM) developed by Richter et al., acceptable fits are
   achieved to downshifted and asymmetrically broadened Raman spectra of Si
   NPs with different diameters, d, from 2.4 nm to 6.3 nm. A comparative
   study using Raman spectra of colloidal Si NPs, for the first time, shows
   an apparent positive linear correlation between alpha and the Si NP
   size. Based on the PCM, the amplitude of the atomic vibration (phonon)
   at the real physical boundary of NPs is proportional to e(-alpha/2),
   which indicates that the amplitude of the first order optical phonon is
   relatively larger at the edges for smaller Si nanostructures despite of
   their stronger phonon confinement weighed by alpha/d(2). Copyright (C)

Title = {{Silica Gel for Enhanced Activity and Hypochlorite Protection of Cyanuric
   Acid Hydrolase in Recombinant Escherichia coli}},
Journal = {{MBIO}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{Chlorinated isocyanuric acids are widely used water disinfectants that
   generate hypochlorite, but with repeated application, they build up
   cyanuric acid (CYA) that must be removed to maintain disinfection.
   3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)-treated Escherichia coli cells
   expressing cyanuric acid hydrolase (CAH) from Moorella thermoacetica
   exhibited significantly high CYA degradation rates and provided
   protection against enzyme inactivation by hypochlorite (chlorine). APTES
   coating or encapsulation of cells had two benefits: (i) overcoming
   diffusion limitations imposed by the cell wall and (ii) protecting
   against hypochlorite inactivation of CAH activity. Cells encapsulated in
   APTES gels degraded CYA three times faster than non-functionalized
   tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) gels, and cells coated with APTES degraded CYA
   at a rate of 29 mu mol/min per mg of CAH protein, similar to the rate
   with purified enzyme. UV spectroscopy, fluorescence spectroscopy, and
   scanning electron microscopy showed that the higher rates were due to
   APTES increasing membrane permeability and enhancing cyanuric acid
   diffusion into the cytoplasm to reach the CAH enzyme. Purified CAH
   enzyme was shown to be rapidly inactivated by hypochlorite. APTES
   aggregates surrounding cells protected via the amine groups reacting
   with hypochlorite as shown by pH changes, zeta potential measurements,
   and infrared spectroscopy. APTES-encapsulated E. coli cells expressing
   CAH degraded cyanuric acid at high rates in the presence of 1 to 10 ppm
   hypochlorite, showing effectiveness under swimming pool conditions. In
   contrast, CAH activity in TEOS gels or free cells was completely
   inactivated by hypochlorite. These studies show that commercially
   available silica materials can selectively enhance, protect, and
   immobilize whole-cell biocatalysts for specialized applications.
   IMPORTANCE Hypochlorite is used in vast quantities for water
   disinfection, killing bacteria on surfaces, and washing and whitening.
   In pools, spas, and other waters, hypochlorite is frequently delivered
   as chlorinated isocyanuric acids that release hypochlorite and cyanuric
   acid. Over time, cyanuric acid accumulates and impairs disinfection and
   must be removed. The microbial enzyme cyanuric acid hydrolase can
   potentially remove cyanuric acid to restore disinfection and protect
   swimmers. Whole bacterial cells expressing cyanuric acid hydrolase were
   encapsulated in an inert silica matrix containing an amine group. The
   amine group serves to permeabilize the cell membrane and accelerate
   cyanuric acid degradation, and it also reacts with hypochlorite to
   protect against inactivation of cyanuric acid hydrolase. Methods for
   promoting whole-cell biocatalysis are important in biotechnology, and
   the present work illustrates approaches to enhance rates and protect
   against an inhibitory substance.}},

Pages = {{1307-1319}},
Month = {{NOV-DEC}},
Abstract = {{We consider an infinite-horizon single-product pricing problem in which
   a fraction of customers is patient and the remaining fraction is
   impatient. A patient customer will wait up to some fixed number of time
   periods for the price of the product to fall below his or her valuation
   at which point the customer will make a purchase. If the price does not
   fall below a patient customer's valuation at any time during those
   periods, then that customer will leave without buying. In contrast,
   impatient customers will not wait, and either buy immediately or leave
   without buying. We prove that there is an optimal dynamic pricing policy
   comprised of repeating cycles of decreasing prices. We obtain bounds on
   the length of these cycles, and we exploit these results to produce an
   efficient dynamic programming approach for computing such an optimal
   policy. We also consider problems in which customers have variable
   levels of patience. For such problems, cycles of decreasing prices may
   no longer be optimal, but numerical experiments nevertheless suggest
   that such a decreasing cyclic policy ( suitably chosen) often performs
   quite well.}},

Volume = {{63}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we develop a distributionally robust portfolio
   optimization model where the robustness is across different dependency
   structures among the random losses. For a Frechet class of discrete
   distributions with overlapping marginals, we show that the
   distributionally robust portfolio optimization problem is efficiently
   solvable with linear programming. To guarantee the existence of a joint
   multivariate distribution consistent with the overlapping marginal
   information, we make use of a graph theoretic property known as the
   running intersection property. Building on this property, we develop a
   tight linear programming formulation to find the optimal portfolio that
   minimizes the worst-case conditional value-at-risk measure. Lastly, we
   use a data-driven approach with financial return data to identify the
   Frechet class of distributions satisfying the running intersection
   property and then optimize the portfolio over this class of
   distributions. Numerical results in two different data sets show that
   the distributionally robust portfolio optimization model improves on the
   sample-based approach.}},

Abstract = {{Thermally-modified wood (TMW) has enhanced properties and its production
   does not involve the use of chemicals. However, the adoption of TMW in
   the marketplace has been limited in the U.S. for reasons that have not
   yet been clearly established. In this study, the marketing practices of
   U.S. producers and distributors of TMW were investigated, by conducting
   semi-structured interviews. Topics included major products and species,
   markets, distribution channels, promotional strategies, perceived
   barriers to adoption, and the outlook for TMW markets. Results show that
   TMW producers in general export a significant percent of their
   production; that TMW is considered a high-end product; and that
   customers are not as sensitive to prices as in other mainstream markets.
   Common products sold include siding, decking, flooring, millwork, and
   components for musical instruments. Respondents believe that the low
   awareness of TMW among the American public is a major barrier to wider
   adoption of TMW. However, companies envision a bright future for TMW as
   sales and inquiries have increased at a fast rate during the last few
   years.}},

Abstract = {{We study feedback control of coupled nonlinear stochastic oscillators in
   a force field. We first consider the problem of asymptotically driving
   the system to a desired steady state corresponding to reduced thermal
   noise. Among the feedback controls achieving the desired asymptotic
   transfer, we find that the most efficient one from an energy point of
   view is characterized by time-reversibility. We also extend the theory
   of Schrodinger bridges to this model, thereby steering the system in
   finite time and with minimum effort to a target steady-state
   distribution. The system can then be maintained in this state through
   the optimal steady-state feedback control. The solution, in the
   finite-horizon case, involves a space-time harmonic function phi, and
   -log phi plays the role of an artificial, time-varying potential in
   which the desired evolution occurs. This framework appears extremely
   general and flexible and can be viewed as a considerable generalization
   of existing active control strategies such as macromolecular cooling. In
   the case of a quadratic potential, the results assume a form
   particularly attractive from the algorithmic viewpoint as the optimal
   control can be computed via deterministic matricial differential
   equations. An example involving inertial particles illustrates both
   transient and steady state optimal feedback control. (C) 2015 AIP

Title = {{Genetic Interactions Implicating Postreplicative Repair in Okazaki
   Fragment Processing}},
Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{11}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Ubiquitination of the replication clamp proliferating cell nuclear
   antigen (PCNA) at the conserved residue lysine (K) 164 triggers
   postreplicative repair (PRR) to fill single-stranded gaps that result
   from stalled DNA polymerases. However, it has remained elusive as to
   whether cells engage PRR in response to replication defects that do not
   directly impair DNA synthesis. To experimentally address this question,
   we performed synthetic genetic array (SGA) analysis with a
   ubiquitination-deficient K164 to arginine (K164R) mutant of PCNA against
   a library of S. cerevisiae temperature-sensitive alleles. The SGA
   signature of the K164R allele showed a striking correlation with
   profiles of mutants deficient in various aspects of lagging strand
   replication, including rad27 Delta and elg1 Delta. Rad27 is the primary
   flap endonuclease that processes 5' flaps generated during lagging
   strand replication, whereas Elg1 has been implicated in unloading PCNA
   from chromatin. We observed chronic ubiquitination of PCNA at K164 in
   both rad27 Delta and elg1 Delta mutants. Notably, only rad27 Delta cells
   exhibited a decline in cell viability upon elimination of PRR pathways,
   whereas elg1 Delta mutants were not affected. We further provide
   evidence that K164 ubiquitination suppresses replication stress
   resulting from defective flap processing during Okazaki fragment
   maturation. Accordingly, ablation of PCNA ubiquitination increased S
   phase checkpoint activation, indicated by hyperphosphorylation of the
   Rad53 kinase. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alternative flap
   processing by overexpression of catalytically active exonuclease 1
   eliminates PCNA ubiquitination. This suggests a model in which
   unprocessed flaps may directly participate in PRR signaling. Our
   findings demonstrate that PCNA ubiquitination at K164 in response to
   replication stress is not limited to DNA synthesis defects but extends
   to DNA processing during lagging strand replication.}},

Abstract = {{We use template stripping to integrate metallic nanostructures onto
   flexible, stretchable, and rollable substrates. Using this approach,
   high-quality patterned metals that are replicated from reusable silicon
   templates can be directly transferred to polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)
   substrates. First we produce stretchable gold nanohole arrays and show
   that their optical transmission spectra can be modulated by mechanical
   stretching. Next we fabricate stretchable arrays of gold pyramids and
   demonstrate a modulation of the wavelength of light resonantly scattered
   from the tip of the pyramid by stretching the underlying PDMS film. The
   use of a flexible transfer layer also enables template stripping using a
   cylindrical roller as a substrate. As an example, we demonstrate roller
   template stripping of metallic nanoholes, nanodisks, wires, and pyramids
   onto the cylindrical surface of a glass rod lens. These nonplanar
   metallic structures produced via template stripping with flexible and
   stretchable films can facilitate many applications in sensing, display,
   plasmonics, metasurfaces, and roll-to-roll fabrication.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing concerns about limited fossil fuel and elevated level of
   atmospheric carbon dioxide are driving force to develop renewable
   biofuels, and microalgae are considered a particularly promising
   feedstock for industrialized biofuel due to their inherent advantages.
   It is imperative to further optimize the growth conditions in order to
   achieve maximal algal biomass productivity and low down the cost of
   microalgal biomass production. The research in this project aimed to
   enhance lipid production of Chlorella vulgaris by optimizing the
   nutrient supply and growth conditions. The effects of temperature,
   nitrogen concentration and initial cell density on neutral lipid
   productivity were evaluated and optimized by response surface method
   with a 17-run Box-Behnken design (BBD). With the increase of temperature
   from 20 to 30 degrees C, the neutral lipid productivity increased up to
   its peak value at 27 degrees C. However, the 2D contour lines showed the
   temperature has a significant effect on neutral lipid productivity
   compared with those of cell density and/or nitrogen concentration. The
   optimal conditions for the algal growth are 1.5 gL(-1) of nitrogen
   concentration and 50\% of cell density at 27.4 degrees C. The optimal
   lipid productivity obtained from the experiment was in agreement with
   the model prediction, confirming the validity of the model. (c) 2015

Abstract = {{In this study, agitation is produced inside a channel by a plate that is
   periodically oscillating normal to the channel side walls. The test
   channel simulates a deep-finned rectangular channel open on one end to a
   plenum and with a gap to allow flow over the tip of the agitator plate.
   The purpose of agitation is to strongly mix the near-wall flow, to thin
   the thermal boundary layer and to increase the convective heat transfer
   coefficient. Heat transfer and velocity measurements are made within
   different regions of the channel to study the effectiveness of such
   agitation. The entry region which is closest to the open end (plenum) is
   characterized by unsteadily driven periodic flow. The base region close
   to the channel base and agitator tip gap has high vortical activity and
   turbulent flow. The central region between the two has an unsteadily
   driven channel flow in one direction of oscillation and is rich in
   advected turbulence in the other direction. A parametric study is done
   to identify parameters that are critical to enhancing heat transfer. The
   amount of agitation produced in the channel directly scales with
   increasing frequency. Agitation is found to scale almost entirely with
   agitation velocity, the product of amplitude and frequency, with
   amplitude being only slightly more important than frequency in a few
   cases. Though this study finds application in electronics cooling where
   agitation can be used inside finned, air-cooled heat sinks to enhance
   heat transfer with walls, the results could be applied to any similar
   situation with such enhancement of heat or mass transfer with active
   surfaces. Very few experimental studies can be found in the literature
   on flow agitation effects on wall transport. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{In this paper, a numerical simulation is performed to predict swirl
   cooling of an internal leading edge cooling passage model for a gas

   are investigated for cases of two rectangular section inlets that cause
   flow to impinge tangentially on the internal surface of the circular
   cooling passage. The effects of aspect ratio of the jet nozzle, jet
   angle and Reynolds numbers on the local and average flows and heat
   transfer are investigated. The results indicate that the pressure loss
   and global area weighted average Nusselt number on the swirl chamber
   increases with increases of Reynolds number, and increases with
   decreases of the jet nozzle aspect ratio. A correlation of the area
   weighted average Nusselt number over a range of parameters is suggested.
   The distribution of Nusselt number over the swirl chamber shows that the
   thermal stresses will be lowest with a 60 degrees jet nozzle angle. (C)

Abstract = {{We describe an automated, volumetric particle image velocimetry (PIV)
   and tracking method that measures time-resolved, 3D zooplankton
   trajectories and surrounding volumetric fluid velocity fields
   simultaneously and non-intrusively. The method is demonstrated for
   groups of copepods flowing past a wall-mounted cylinder. We show that
   copepods execute escape responses when subjected to a strain rate
   threshold upstream of a cylinder, but the same threshold range elicits
   no escape responses in the turbulent wake downstream. The method was
   also used to document the instantaneous slip velocity of zooplankton and
   the resulting differences in trajectory between zooplankton and
   non-inertial fluid particles in the unsteady wake flow, showing the
   method's capability to quantify drift for both passive and motile
   organisms in turbulent environments. Applications of the method extend
   to any group of organisms interacting with the surrounding fluid
   environment, where organism location, larger-scale eddies and
   smaller-scale fluid deformation rates can all be tracked and analyzed.}},

Abstract = {{Owing to its high room-temperature electron mobility and wide bandgap,
   BaSnO3 has recently become of significant interest for potential
   room-temperature oxide electronics. A hybrid molecular beam epitaxy
   (MBE) approach for the growth of high-quality BaSnO3 films is developed
   in this work. This approach employs hexamethylditin as a chemical
   precursor for tin, an effusion cell for barium, and a radio frequency
   plasma source for oxygen. BaSnO3 films were thus grown on SrTiO3 (001)
   and LaAlO3 (001) substrates. Growth conditions for stoichiometric BaSnO3
   were identified. Reflection high-energy electron diffraction (RHEED)
   intensity oscillations, characteristic of a layer-by-layer growth mode
   were observed. A critical thickness of similar to 1 nm for strain
   relaxation was determined for films grown on SrTiO3 using in situ RHEED.
   Scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron
   energy-loss spectroscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy
   confirmed the cube-on-cube epitaxy and composition. The importance of
   precursor chemistry is discussed in the context of the MBE growth of
   BaSnO3. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Title = {{Atomic and electronic structure of exfoliated black phosphorus}},

Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Black phosphorus, a layered two-dimensional crystal with tunable
   electronic properties and high hole mobility, is quickly emerging as a
   promising candidate for future electronic and photonic devices. Although
   theoretical studies using ab initio calculations have tried to predict
   its atomic and electronic structure, uncertainty in its fundamental
   properties due to a lack of clear experimental evidence continues to
   stymie our full understanding and application of this novel material. In
   this work, aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron
   microscopy and ab initio calculations are used to study the crystal
   structure of few-layer black phosphorus. Directly interpretable annular
   dark-field images provide a three-dimensional atomic-resolution view of
   this layered material in which its stacking order and all three lattice
   parameters can be unambiguously identified. In addition, electron
   energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is used to measure the conduction band
   density of states of black phosphorus, which agrees well with the
   results of density functional theory calculations performed for the
   experimentally determined crystal. Furthermore, experimental EELS
   measurements of interband transitions and surface plasmon excitations
   are also consistent with simulated results. Finally, the effects of
   oxidation on both the atomic and electronic structure of black
   phosphorus are analyzed to explain observed device degradation. The
   transformation of black phosphorus into amorphous PO3 or H3PO3 during
   oxidation may ultimately be responsible for the degradation of devices
   exposed to atmosphere over time. (C) 2015 American Vacuum Society.}},

Abstract = {{Recent animal studies have shown that carbon nanotubes (CNTs) may pose a
   significant health risk to those exposed in the workplace. To further
   understand this potential risk, effort must be taken to measure the
   occupational exposure to CNTs. Results from an assessment of potential
   exposure to multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) conducted at an
   industrial facility where polymer nanocomposites were manufactured by an
   extrusion process are presented. Exposure to MWCNTs was quantified by
   the thermal-optical analysis for elemental carbon (EC) of respirable
   dust collected by personal sampling. All personal respirable samples
   collected (n = 8) had estimated 8-h time weighted average (TWA) EC
   concentrations below the limit of detection for the analysis which was
   about one-half of the recommended exposure limit for CNTs, 1 A mu g
   EC/m(3) as an 8-h TWA respirable mass concentration. Potential exposure
   sources were identified and characterized by direct-reading instruments
   and area sampling. Area samples analyzed for EC yielded quantifiable
   mass concentrations inside an enclosure where unbound MWCNTs were
   handled and near a pelletizer where nanocomposite was cut, while those
   analyzed by electron microscopy detected the presence of MWCNTs at six
   locations throughout the facility. Through size selective area sampling
   it was identified that the airborne MWCNTs present in the workplace were
   in the form of large agglomerates. This was confirmed by electron
   microscopy where most of the MWCNT structures observed were in the form
   of micrometer-sized ropey agglomerates. However, a small fraction of
   single, free MWCNTs was also observed. It was found that the high number
   concentrations of nanoparticles, similar to 200000 particles/cm(3),
   present in the manufacturing facility were likely attributable to
   polymer fumes produced in the extrusion process.}},

Abstract = {{The present work reports some interesting experimental results for
   ventilated supercavitation in an unsteady flow. Our experiments have
   shown that incoming flow unsteadiness does not only affect supercavity

   the presence of a body inside the supercavity. Synchronized high-speed
   imaging and pressure measurements have ascertained the dependence of
   supercavity closure on instantaneous cavitation number under unsteady
   flow conditions. Further, control-volume analysis at the closure shows
   the intricate relation among the cavitation number, pressure difference
   occurring at the supercavity closure and the obtained closure
   mechanisms. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The choice of test oracle-the artifact that determines whether an
   application under test executes correctly-can significantly impact the
   effectiveness of the testing process. However, despite the prevalence of
   tools that support test input selection, little work exists for
   supporting oracle creation. We propose a method of supporting test
   oracle creation that automatically selects the oracle data-the set of
   variables monitored during testing-for expected value test oracles. This
   approach is based on the use of mutation analysis to rank variables in
   terms of fault-finding effectiveness, thus automating the selection of
   the oracle data. Experimental results obtained by employing our method
   over six industrial systems (while varying test input types and the
   number of generated mutants) indicate that our method-when paired with
   test inputs generated either at random or to satisfy specific structural
   coverage criteria-may be a cost-effective approach for producing small,
   effective oracle data sets, with fault finding improvements over current
   industrial best practice of up to 1,435 percent observed (with typical
   improvements of up to 50 percent).}},

Title = {{Field infiltration measurements in grassed roadside drainage ditches:
   Spatial and temporal variability}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{530}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Roadside drainage ditches (grassed swales) are an attractive stormwater
   control measure (SCM) since they can reduce runoff volume by
   infiltrating water into the soil, filter sediments and associated
   pollutants out of the water, and settle solids onto the soil surface. In
   this study a total of 722 infiltration measurements were collected in
   five swales located in Twin-Cities, MN and one swale located in Madison,
   WI to characterize the field-saturated hydraulic conductivity(K-fs)
   derived from the infiltration measurements of these swales. Measurements
   were taken with a falling head device, the Modified Philip Dunne (MPD)
   infiltrometer, which allows the collection of simultaneous infiltration
   measurements at multiple locations with several infiltrometers.
   Field-saturated hydraulic conductivity was higher than expected for
   different soil texture classes. We hypothesize that this is due to plant
   roots creating macro-pores that break up the soil for infiltration.
   Statistical analysis was performed on the K-fs values to analyze the
   effect of initial soil moisture content, season, soil texture class and
   distance in downstream direction on the geometric mean K-fs value of a
   swale. Because of the high spatial variation of K-fs in the same swale
   no effect of initial soil moisture content, season and soil texture
   class was observed on the geometric mean K-fs value. But the distance in
   downstream direction may have positive or negative effect on the K-fs
   value. An uncertainty analysis on the K-fs value indicated that
   approximately twenty infiltration measurements is the minimum number to
   obtain a representative geometric mean K-fs value of a swale that is
   less than 350 m long within an acceptable level of uncertainty. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The colon tumor microenvironment is becoming increasingly recognized as
   a complex but central player in the development of many cancers.
   Previously, we identified an oncogenic role for the mRNA-binding protein
   IMP1 (IGF2BP1) in the epithelium during colon tumorigenesis. In the
   current study, we reveal the contribution of stromal IMP1 in the context
   of colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis. Interestingly, stromal
   deletion of Imp1 (Dermo1Cre;Imp1(LoxP/LoxP), or Imp1 Delta(Mes)) in the
   azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS) model of
   colitis-associated cancer resulted in increased tumor numbers of larger
   size and more advanced histologic grade than controls. In addition,
   Imp1(Delta Mes) mice exhibited a global increase in protumorigenic
   microenvironment factors, including enhanced inflammation and stromal
   components. Evaluation of purified mesenchyme from AOM/DSS-treated
   Imp1(Delta Mes) mice demonstrated an increase in hepatocyte growth
   factor (HGF), which has not been associated with regulation via IMP1.
   Genetic knockdown of Imp1 in human primary fibroblasts confirmed an
   increase in HGF with Imp1 loss, demonstrating a specific,
   cell-autonomous role for Imp1 loss to increase HGF expression. Taken
   together, these data demonstrate a novel tumor-suppressive role for IMP1
   in colon stromal cells and underscore an exquisite, context-specific
   function for mRNA-binding proteins, such as IMP1, in disease states. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper investigates 2-D media noise in shingled magnetic recording
   (SMR) systems. The media noises caused by the overwriting of the next
   track and the residual information from the previous track are
   asymmetric in the cross-track (CT) direction and are found to vary with
   the linear density. The media noise after equalization is found to be
   2-D data dependent, with its mean and variance affected by the nonlinear
   transition shift in the CT and down-track directions, respectively. Also
   the effect of media noise on the bit error rate (BER) is studied for
   increased track densities during the writing process. The effect of
   jitter on the BER is always significant with increased track density in
   SMR systems, while the effect of overwriting and inter-track
   interference on the BER performance are quite different for readback
   with rotated and normally oriented readers, even though the same writer
   is used during the writing process.}},

Abstract = {{Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR) is a promising approach to
   increase the areal density of hard disk drives. The purpose of this
   paper is to provide a computational framework for optimizing the HAMR
   system. In order to do that, an integrated HAMR simulation system was
   built. We then studied several factors that could affect the playback
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), such as the switching time of the writing
   field, the peak temperature of the heat spot, the standard deviation of
   anisotropy field and exchange parameters, and the size of the reader
   element. We found that bit length (BL) becomes the key factor for the
   value of SNR for small, e.g., 10 nm, BLs. We established a relationship
   between the SNR and the bit error rate so that it will be easy to
   predict the storage capacity based on the playback SNR. This curve is
   used to predict the possible storage capacity for different BLs.}},

   Tb/in(2) on BPM owing to excessive heating of the adjacent track,
   causing adjacent track erasure to date. Shingled recording on granular
   media, using two dimensional magnetic recording (TDMR) detection depends
   greatly on the mechanical systems, with likely user densities reaching
   similar to 2.5 Tb/in(2). Finally, shingled recording without heat assist
   on BPM yielded an unexpectedly high density of similar to 8 Tb/in(2).}},

Abstract = {{The embedded mask patterning (EMP) method uses a plasma etching process
   to form an ultrasmall grain size (similar to 4 nm), but thermally stable
   isolated L1(0)-FePt magnetic grains with an embedded Ru hard mask. EMP
   demonstrated as a promising and potentially cost-effective solution to
   fabricate ultrahigh density magnetic media for heat-assisted magnetic
   recording. In this simulation study, we investigated the
   manufacturability of formation of these high aspect ratio (AR),
   nanometer-sized spaced grains in a methanol (MeOH)/Ar plasma etch
   process used to etch FePt layer through Ru mask opening and to form a
   volatile Fe-carbonyl product. We developed a model based on the
   ion-neutral synergy model, and included the effect of potentially
   redeposited etch product inside the high AR narrow grain spacing by
   calculating the redeposition flux distribution in addition to neutral
   and ion flux coverage over the etch surface. Our simulation shows that
   the redeposition rate increases as etching progresses deeper into the
   substrate, which significantly reduces the etch rate inside the high AR
   features and produces nonuniform etched depth across the grain boundary
   distribution, which may lead to under-etched grain spacing and degrade
   media magnetic properties. The etch rate model is combined with a
   developed 2-D level set computational program to study the
   redeposition-induced defects pattern defects. Micromagnetic simulation
   also shows these defects can be responsible for the experimental
   observed media magnetic properties change.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we study the performance of rateless error correction
   codes in a wireless ad hoc network (WANET). The salient features of a
   WANET are Rayleigh fading, constant power transmission, pure ALOHA as
   the channel access protocol, and the nodes being modeled by a
   homogeneous space-time Poisson point process. For such a WANET, this
   paper quantifies the rate density (RD) and the dynamic variations of the
   packet transmission time by deriving an upper bound on the CCDF of the
   packet transmission time. The performance of rateless codes is compared
   with two benchmarks, i.e., the ergodic RD (ERD) and the RD of fixed-rate
   codes. The proposed rateless coding scheme does not require time
   diversity as each packet is transmitted within a single coherence time.
   Yet, it is shown that the RD can be up to 76\% and 50\% of the ERD in
   noise-and interference-limited regimes, respectively. Thus, the
   presented network nearly achieves the ERD while requiring significantly
   shorter delays. This paper shows that a low-complexity Gaussian receiver
   with a nearest neighbor decoder has almost the performance of an ideal
   matched receiver. We also show that power control in the form of channel
   thresholding leads to a 72\% gain in the RD relative to a constant power
   transmission.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Modulating the immune system does not reverse long-term
   disability in neurologic disorders. Better neuroregenerative and
   neuroprotective treatment strategies are needed for neuroinflammatory
   and neurodegenerative diseases.
   OBJECTIVE To review the role of monoclonal, naturally occurring
   antibodies (NAbs) as novel therapeutic molecules for treatment of
   neurologic disorders.
   EVIDENCE REVIEW Peer-reviewed articles, including case reports, case
   series, retrospective reviews, prospective randomized clinical trials,
   and basic science reports, were identified in a PubMed search for
   articles about NAbs and neurologic disorders that were published from
   January 1, 1964, through June 30, 2015. We concentrated our review on
   multiple sclerosis, Parkinson disease, Alzheimer disease, and
   amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.
   FINDINGS Many insults, including trauma, ischemia, infection,
   inflammation, and neurodegeneration, result in irreversible damage to
   the central nervous system. Central nervous system injury often results
   in a pervasive inhibitory microenvironment that hinders regeneration. A
   common targeted drug development strategy is to identify molecules with
   high potency in animal models. Many approaches often fail in the
   clinical setting owing to a lack of efficacy in human diseases (eg, less
   than the response demonstrated in animal models) or a high incidence of
   toxic effects. An alternative approach is to identify NAbs in humans
   because these therapeutic molecules have potential physiologic function
   without toxic effects. NAbs of the IgG, IgA, or IgM isotype contain
   germline or close to germline sequences and are reactive to
   self-components, altered self-components, or foreign antigens. Our
   investigative group developed recombinant, autoreactive, natural human
   IgM antibodies directed against oligodendrocytes or neurons with
   therapeutic potential for central nervous system repair. One such
   molecule, recombinant HIgM22, directed againstmyelin and
   oligodendrocytes completed a successful phase 1 clinical trial without
   toxic effects with the goal of promoting remyelination in multiple
   sclerosis.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Animal studies demonstrate that certain
   monoclonal NAbs are beneficial as therapeutic agents for neurologic
   diseases. This class of antibodies represents a unique source from which
   to develop a new class of disease-modifying therapies.}},

Abstract = {{While bacteria have been primarily studied for phosphorus (P) removal in

   intracellular polyphosphate are less investigated. P-accumulating fungal
   strains were screened from soybean plants and surrounding soil by flask
   cultivation with potato dextrose broth and KH2PO4 in this study. Mucor
   circinelloides was selected for its high efficiency in P removal
   efficiency and high cellular P content. Neisser staining and
   growth-curve analysis confirmed that M. circinelloides stored
   polyphosphate intracellularly by luxury phosphate uptake. The effect of
   culture medium compositions on P removal efficiency and cellular P
   content was also investigated. Monosaccharides (such as glucose and
   fructose) and organic nitrogen (N, such as urea, and peptone) promoted
   fungi growth and P accumulation. M. circinelloides also preferred
   organic phosphates. When glucose, urea, and phytic acid sodium salt were
   used as the carbon, N, and P source, respectively, the maximum
   utilization efficiency was 40.1 \% for P and 7.08 \% for cellular P
   content. In addition, the potential of M. circinelloides for P removal
   from waste streams was investigated. Compared with the non-inoculated
   control culture, inoculation with M. circinelloides improved the soluble
   P removal in treating wastewater centrate, screened manure, and digested

Abstract = {{A new Cardiac Electrical Sparse Imaging (CESI) technique is proposed to
   image cardiac activation throughout the three-dimensional myocardium
   from body surface electrocardiogram (ECG) with the aid of individualized
   heart-torso geometry. The sparse property of cardiac electrical activity
   in the time domain is utilized in the temporal sparse promoting inverse
   solution, one formulated to achieve higher spatial-temporal resolution,
   stronger robustness and thus enhanced capability in imaging cardiac
   electrical activity. Computer simulations were carried out to evaluate
   the performance of this imaging method under various circumstances. A
   total of 12 single site pacing and 7 dual sites pacing simulations with
   artificial and the hospital recorded sensor noise were used to evaluate
   the accuracy and stability of the proposed method. Simulations with
   modeling error on heart-torso geometry and electrode-torso registration
   were also performed to evaluate the robustness of the technique. In
   addition to the computer simulations, the CESI algorithm was further
   evaluated using experimental data in an animal model where the
   noninvasively imaged activation sequences were compared with those
   measured with simultaneous intracardiac mapping. All of the CESI results
   were compared with conventional weighted minimum norm solutions. The
   present results show that CESI can image with better accuracy, stability
   and stronger robustness in both simulated and experimental
   circumstances. In sum, we have proposed a novel method for cardiac
   activation imaging, and our results suggest that the CESI has enhanced
   performance, and offers the potential to image the cardiac activation
   and to assist in the clinical management of ventricular arrhythmias.}},

Abstract = {{We present a special symmetric Lanczos algorithm and a kernel polynomial
   method (KPM) for approximating the absorption spectrum of molecules
   within the linear response time-dependent density functional theory
   (TDDFT) framework in the product form. In contrast to existing
   algorithms, the new algorithms are based on reformulating the original
   non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem as a product eigenvalue problem and the
   observation that the product eigenvalue problem is self-adjoint with
   respect to an appropriately chosen inner product. This allows a simple
   symmetric Lanczos algorithm to be used to compute the desired absorption
   spectrum. The use of a symmetric Lanczos algorithm only requires half of
   the memory compared with the nonsymmetric variant of the Lanczos
   algorithm. The symmetric Lanczos algorithm is also numerically more
   stable than the nonsymmetric version. The KPM algorithm is also
   presented as a low-memory alternative to the Lanczos approach, but the
   algorithm may require more matrix-vector multiplications in practice. We
   discuss the pros and cons of these methods in terms of their accuracy as
   well as their computational and storage cost. Applications to a set of
   small and medium-sized molecules are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{Background: A surgeon's skill in the operating room has been shown to
   correlate with a patient's clinical outcome. The prompt accurate
   assessment of surgical skill remains a challenge, in part, because
   expert faculty reviewers are often unavailable. By harnessing the power
   of large readily available crowds through the Internet, rapid, accurate,
   and low-cost assessments may be achieved. We hypothesized that
   assessments provided by crowd workers highly correlate with expert
   surgeons' assessments.
   Materials and Methods: A group of 49 surgeons from two hospitals
   performed two dry-laboratory robotic surgical skill assessment tasks.
   The performance of these tasks was video recorded and posted online for
   evaluation using Amazon Mechanical Turk. The surgical tasks in each
   video were graded by (n=30) varying crowd workers and (n=3) experts
   using a modified global evaluative assessment of Robotic Skills (GEARS)
   grading tool, and the mean scores were compared using Cronbach's alpha
   statistic.
   Results: GEARS evaluations from the crowd were obtained for each video
   and task and compared with the GEARS ratings from the expert surgeons.
   The crowd-based performance scores agreed with the performance
   assessments by experts with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.84 and 0.92 for the
   two tasks, respectively.
   Conclusion: The assessment of surgical skill by crowd workers resulted
   in a high degree of agreement with the scores provided by expert
   surgeons in the evaluation of basic robotic surgical dry-laboratory
   tasks. Crowd responses cost less and were much faster to acquire. This
   study provides evidence that crowds may provide an adjunctive method for
   rapidly providing feedback of skills to training and practicing
   surgeons.}},
