Abstract = {{Electrodeposition of Si from cryolite based melts is a possible solution
   for mass production of solar grade silicon. The deposition potential of
   Si on the candidate cathode, such as graphite, is fundamental
   information that needs to be measured and applied to restrict the
   co-deposition of impurities. In this study this potential was measured
   using cyclic voltammetry. As the activity of SiO2 in the electrolyte
   affects the deposition potential, the measurement was carried out in a
   range of SiO2 concentration, allowing the prediction of potential change
   during the actual deposition process, where the SiO2 content undergoes
   fluctuations. The kinetics of the oxidation and reduction reactions were
   also studied using the recorded voltammograms, showing that reduction of
   Si is a two steps process controlled by diffusion.}},

   such as supercapacitors, batteries and fuel cells. Despite the research
   and commercialization work that has been carried out, there is still a
   need to understand some of the fundamental characteristics of the role
   of activated carbon and the electrolyte in charge storage and ion
   migration within these structures. There has been two general types of
   electrolytes used; aqueous electrolytes with high concentrations of
   conductive salts and organic electrolytes modified to be conductive or
   directly conductive as in the form of ionic liquids. The former have
   high ionic conductance, the latter have a larger voltage range for
   stability. In this work we introduce an alternative to theses
   electrolytes, a low temperature molten inorganic salt. Potential
   advantages include high conductivity and a large potential operating

Abstract = {{Electrolytes were deposited by atmospheric suspension plasma spraying
   (SPS) in metal-supported SOFCs having both anode-and cathode-down
   configurations. The electrodes on the metal supports were intentionally
   made thin (< 30 mu m) and smooth (average roughness < 2.5 mu m) to
   reduce the formation of segmentation cracks and concentrated porosity in
   the electrolytes. In the anode-down cells, the electrolytes had minimal
   concentrated porosity and no segmentation cracks were observed. Open
   circuit voltages (OCVs) were above 1.05 V at 750 degrees C in cells with
   21 m thick electrolytes. The electrolytes in cathode-down cells had
   higher leak rates than those in the anode-down cells, and segmentation
   cracks were observed in some cathode-down cell electrolytes. The
   cathode-down cells having the most gas-tight electrolytes were
   electrochemically tested. OCVs were initially above 1.04 V, though
   performance declined significantly within 2-4 hours. In contrast, the
   OCVs of the anode-down cells were approximately constant after 12 hours
   of testing.}},

   information is obtained from a clinical (single camera) endoscope

   dynamically tracks the suture needle and surface markers. This drives
   robotic needle steering through a set of surgeon-defined entry/exit

Abstract = {{Locating end-effector tips is a prerequisite step in micromanipulation.
   The tip of micromanipulation tools is typically a few micrometers in
   size and highly delicate. In all existing automated micromanipulation
   systems, the process of locating the end-effector tip is conducted by a
   skilled operator, and the automation of this task has not been
   attempted. This paper presents a technique for automatically locating
   end-effector tips. The technique consists of programmed sweeping
   patterns, MHI (motion history image) end-effector detection, active
   contour for estimating end-effector positions, autofocusing and
   quad-tree search for locating end-effector tip, and finally visual
   servoing to position the tip to the center of the field of view. Two
   types of micromanipulation tools (micropipette representing single-ended
   tools and microgripper representing multi-ended tools) were used in
   experiments for testing. Quantitative results were reported in the speed
   and success rate of the auto-locating technique, based on over 500
   trials. Furthermore, the effect of factors such as imaging mode and
   image processing parameter selections was also quantitatively discussed.
   Guidelines are provided for the implementation of the technique in order
   to achieve high efficiency and success rates.}},

Abstract = {{Microtruss cellular metals are a class of multifunctional materials,
   composed of a regular arrangement of supporting struts. They can be
   fabricated by stretching perforated metal sheets out of plane by
   applying force at strut intersections. Once fabricated, external loads
   are resolved axially along the struts resulting in stretch dominated
   deformation, yielding enhanced weight specific strength and stiffness at
   lower densities compared to conventional metallic foams. Given the
   slenderness of the struts making up the microtruss architecture, failure
   often occurs by inelastic buckling and is therefore dependent on the
   rigidity of the strut end constraints. During column buckling the
   limiting conditions are pin jointed (k=1) and rigid jointed (k=2), with
   microtruss struts typically having end constraints intermediate to these
   boundaries. Experimental and finite element methods were used to
   determine the value of k in IN600 microtrusses. Because of the
   non-linear stress-strain behavior of the parent metal, the relative
   significance of end constraint uncertainty is a function of the strut
   slenderness ratios and the material in question.}},

Abstract = {{We study the problem of broadcasting a binary source over a two-receiver
   erasure broadcast channel with source-channel bandwidth mismatch under a
   Hamming distortion measure. Given the distortion constraints of both
   users, we establish a lower bound for the minimum latency required and
   show that this bound is at least as tight as the one obtained from the
   source-channel separation theorem. Our derivation involves adapting an
   outer bound given by Reznic et al. (2006) for the related quadratic
   Gaussian source broadcast problem. The key step in our outer bound is to
   replace the entropy power inequality used by Reznic et al. with a
   suitable inequality for erasure broadcast channels. For the special case
   in which the user with the better channel requires lossless
   reconstruction, we present a coding scheme based on a hybrid
   digital-analog transmission technique and numerically evaluate both
   inner and outer bounds.}},

Abstract = {{Coordinated intercell interference management is essential in dense
   heterogeneous networks with limited back-haul capacity. This paper
   proposes a cluster-based hierarchical cooperative transmission and
   resource allocation scheme with proportionally fair objective in a
   cellular network where both the macro base station (BS) and the small
   cell access-points (SCAs) are equipped with multiple antennas and share
   the entire available bandwidth. As the first step, SCAs form clusters
   based on their pairwise distances where each cluster comprised of
   adjacent SCAs which are potentially strong interferers. Clustering
   enables intra-cluster coordinated transmission and inter-cluster
   coordinated resource allocation. Specifically, SCAs within each cluster
   form a network multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, share the
   users' data symbols, and cancel intra-cluster interference via
   zero-forcing spatial multiplexing. Further, a distributed power control
   scheme is devised for the purpose of mitigating inter-cluster
   interference without exchanging users' data signals. We show that
   clustering facilitates intra-cluster coordination by enabling data
   exchange and channel training with reasonable backhaul communication
   within each cluster. We also show that the proposed inter-cluster power
   control scheme can further improve the network-wide utility.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the significance of decomposition-based schemes
   in achieving the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) of multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) cellular networks. We consider MIMO cellular
   networks with G cells, K users/cell with M antennas at each user, and N
   antennas at each base-station (BS). We assume all channels to be generic
   and time varying. We show that KMN/KM+N DoF/cell can be achieved through
   one-sided decomposition of a MIMO cellular network (on the user side),
   followed by the use of an asymptotic interference alignment scheme. We
   then prove that such an approach achieves the optimal DoF whenever M/N =
   1/q, where q is an element of \{1/G-1, 1/G-2, ..., 1, 2, ..., (G-1)K\}.
   The optimality is proved using a new set of outer bounds on the DoF of a
   MIMO cellular network. Finally, we comment on the DoF achieved using
   two-sided decomposition, and the optimal DoF of cellular networks with
   single-antenna users and cellular networks with two cells.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies single-user compression for the uplink multi-cell
   processing (MCP) model where multiple base-stations are connected to a
   central processor via noiseless backhaul links with a sum capacity
   constraint. The proposed scheme is based on the virtual multiple-access
   channel (V-MAC) architecture, where the base-stations quantize the
   received signals and send the quantized bits to the central processor,
   and at the decoder side the central processor first recovers the
   quantized signals then decodes the user messages in a successive manner.
   This paper focuses on the use of single-user compression in the V-MAC
   architecture, which is significantly simpler to implement than Wyner-Ziv
   compression. The main result of this paper is that single-user
   compression can achieve the sum capacity of the MCP model to within a
   constant gap under two specific scenarios. First, we define a diagonally
   dominant channel criterion and show the constant-gap result for the case
   when the covariance matrix of the received signals across the
   base-stations is kappa-strictly diagonally dominant for some constant
   kappa > 1. Second, we show that the constant-gap result holds for a
   special class of Wyner channel models in the weak interference regime.}},

Abstract = {{We revisit two classes of previously proposed robust streaming-erasure
   codes - MIDAS codes and PRC codes - which guarantee streaming recovery
   over a class of packet erasure channels. We propose a modified
   construction for each class using diagonally-interleaved MDS codes. Our
   proposed codes have near identical performance over deterministic
   erasure channels, but only require a field size that grows polynomially
   in the delay. In contrast the previous constructions require that the
   field size increase exponentially with the delay. We also evaluate the
   performance of the proposed codes over Gilbert-Elliott channels and show
   that some penalty does result when finite field size is considered.}},

Abstract = {{A double-beam system is used to model a single conductor transmission
   line with a stockbridge damper. The base beam represents the conductor
   and is subjected to an axial tensile load. The in-span beam with a tip
   mass at each end models the Stock-bridge damper and it is arbitrarily
   attached to the base beam. Using Hamilton's principle, the system
   equations of motion are derived and an expression is presented for the
   frequency equation. The formulation is validated with finite element
   results in the literature. Parametric studies are done to investigate
   the influence of the flexural rigidity and location of the in-span beam
   on the lowest five natural frequencies of the system. Investigation is
   also performed to examine the effect of the distance separating to two

Abstract = {{Middleboxes are widely deployed in today's enterprise networks. They
   perform a wide range of important network functions, including WAN
   optimizations, intrusion detection systems, network and application
   level firewalls, etc. Depending on the processing requirement of
   traffic, packet processing for different traffic flows may consume
   vastly different amounts of hardware resources (e. g., CPU and link
   bandwidth). Multi-resource fair queueing allows each traffic flow to
   receive a fair share of multiple middlebox resources. Previous schemes
   for multi-resource fair queueing, however, are expensive to implement at
   high speeds. Specifically, the time complexity to schedule a packet is
   O(log n), where n is the number of backlogged flows. In this paper, we
   design a new multi-resource fair queueing scheme that schedules packets
   in a way similar to Elastic Round Robin. Our scheme requires only O(1)
   work to schedule a packet and is simple enough to implement in practice.
   We show, both analytically and experimentally, that our queueing scheme
   achieves nearly perfect Dominant Resource Fairness.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-tier architecture improves the spatial reuse of radio spectrum in
   cellular networks, and user classification allows consideration for
   diverse user service requirements. But they introduce complicated
   heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of transmitters, which brings
   to new challenges in interference analysis. In this work, we present a
   stochastic geometric model to evaluate the uplink interference in a
   two-tier network considering multi-type tier-1 users, tier-2 cells and
   tier-2 users. Each type of tier-1 users and tier-2 base stations are
   modeled as independent homogeneous Poisson point process, and each type
   of tier-2 users are modeled as local non-homogeneous Poisson point
   process centered at tier-2 base stations. By applying a
   superposition-aggregation-superposition (SAS) approach, we numerically
   characterize the interference at of both tiers. Finally, simulation
   results validate our model and illustrate that our model offers
   substantial improvement in accuracy compared with the best known
   approximation model.}},

Abstract = {{Three-Dimensional (3D) range cameras have recently appeared in the
   marketplace for use in surveillance (e.g. cameras affixed to inanimate
   objects) applications. We present FreeGlass(TM) as a wearable hands-
   free 3D gesture- sensing Digital Eye Glass system. FreeGlass comprises a
   head- mounted display with an infrared range camera, both connected to a
   wearable computer. It is based on the MannGlas(TM)computerized welding
   glass, which embodies HDR (High Dynamic Range) and AR (Augmented/
   Augmediated Reality). FreeGlass recontextualizes the 3D range camera as
   a sousveillance (e.g. cameras attached to people) camera. In this
   sousveillance context, the range camera is worn by the user and shares
   the same point-of-view as the user. Computer vision algorithms therefore
   benefit from the use of the range camera to allow image segmentation by
   using both the infrared and depth information from the device for 3D
   hand gesture recognition system. The gesture recognition is then
   accomplished by using a neural network on the segmented hand. Recognized
   gestures are used to provide the user with interactions in an
   augmediated reality environment. Additionally, we present applications
   of FreeGlass for serendipitous gesture recognition in everyday life, as
   well as for interaction with real-world objects (with and without
   gesture recognition). A plurality of FreeGlass units can be used
   together, each sensor having a different spreading sequence, or the
   like, so that a number of people can collaborate and share the same or

Abstract = {{Existential tinkering as a form of inquiry must be brought into the
   engineering curriculum at the university level, as well as into the
   education curricula in general, including early childhood education.
   This paper presents a methodology of education for people of all ages
   and abilities, including engineering education, through unstructured
   play, personal involvement (authenticity), expression, and
   exploration-playful tinkering-as forms of inquiry. Current methods of
   engineering education have too much emphasis on structure, creating
   rigidity that destroys the capacity for creativity and radical
   innovation and invention. We introduce ``
   existinquiry/praxistemology{''} (existential tinkering as inquiry) as a
   learning methodology consisting of three parts: learning by thinking,
   learning by doing, and `` learning by being{''} (existential education).
   The goal of this learning methodology is to create lateral thinkers who
   integrate ideas and methodologies normally associated with play, the
   arts, and the sciences, into the the creative thinking process of
   engineering and design. Our hope is that (1) existinquiry in engineeing
   education will create more competitive and versatile thinkers capable of
   solving more sophisticated problems; and (2) that combining concepts of
   engineering education with concepts of unstructured play that are
   normally associated with early childhood education, will result in more
   groundbreaking inventions. We playfully explore topics of Veillance
   (surveillance, sousveillance, reciprocal transparency,
   equiveillance/omniveillance, uberveillance, and dataveillance) and
   Natural User Interfaces with the fundamental Elements (earth, water,
   air, etc.). The methodologies are applicable to teaching engineering to
   children or adults of any age or ability.}},

Abstract = {{The needs of a realtime vision aid require that it functions
   immediately, not merely for production of a picture or video record to
   be viewed later. Therefore the vision system must offer a high dynamic
   range ( often hundreds of millions to one) that functions in real time.
   In compliment with the existing efficient and real-time HDR compositing
   algorithms, we propose a novel method for compressing High Dynamic Range
   (HDR) images by Per-Pixel Exposure Mapping (PPEM). Unlike any existing
   methods, PPEM only varies exposure to achieve tone mapping. It takes
   advantage of the camera response to enable exposure synthesis which we
   call Wyckoff set expansion. The method evaluates the synthetic exposures
   in a recursive pairwise process to generate a tone mapped HDR image. The
   results can be approximated using a look-up table, which can be used for
   real-time HDR applications.}},

Abstract = {{Wearable computing can be used to both extend the range of human
   perception, and to share sensory experiences with others. For this
   objective to be made practical, engineering considerations such as form
   factor, computational power, and power consumption are critical
   concerns. In this work, we consider the design of a low-power visual
   seeing aid, and how to implement computationally-intensive computational
   photography algorithms in a small form factor with low power
   consumption.
   We present realtime an FPGA-based HDR (High Dynamic Range) video
   processing and filtering by integrating tonal and spatial information
   obtained from multiple different exposures of the same subject matter.
   In this embodiment the system captures, in rapid succession, sets of
   three exposures, `` dark{''}, `` medium{''}, and `` light{''}, over and
   over again, e. g. `` dark{''}, `` medium{''}, `` light{''}, `` dark{''},
   `` medium{''}, `` light{''}, and so on, at 60 frames per second. These
   exposures are used to determine an estimate of the photoquantity every
   1/60th of a second (each time a frame comes in, an estimate goes out).
   This allows us to build a seeing aid that helps people see better in
   high contrast scenes, for example, while welding, or in outdoor scenes,
   or scenes where a bright light is shining directly into the eyes of the
   wearer. Our system is suitable for being built into eyeglasses or small
   camera-based, lifeglogging, or gesturesensing pendants, and other
   miniature wearable devices, with low-power and compact circuits that can
   be easily mounted on the body.}},

Abstract = {{Surveillance is a French word that means ``to watch from above{''} (e.g.
   guards watching prisoners, police watching citizens, etc.). Another form
   of veillance (watching) is sousveillance, which means ``to watch from
   below{''}. Whereas surveillance often means cameras on large entities
   (e. g. buildings and land), sousveillance often means cameras on small
   entities (e. g. individual people). The importance of sousveillance has
   come to the forefront recently with advancements in wearable computing
   and AR (augmented or augmediated reality).
   We characterize sousveillance from both an economic and moral
   perspective. We argue that societies that reject sousveillance will be
   impoverished, relative to those accepting sousveillance. We further
   argue that sousveillance as a form of social action has positive
   survival characteristics, so that in the long run, assuming that social
   and technological trends continue, the widespread adoption of
   sousveillance is inevitable.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the invention and implementation of 3D (Three
   Dimensional) HDR (High Dynamic Range) sensing, along with examples. We
   propose a method of 3D HDR veillance (sensing, computer vision, video
   capture, or the like) by integrating tonal and spatial information
   obtained from multiple HDR exposures for use in conjunction with one or
   more 3D cameras.
   In one embodiment, we construct a 3D HDR camera from multiple 3D cameras
   such as Kinect sensors. In this embodiment the 3D cameras are arranged
   in a fixed array, such that the geometric relationships between them
   remain constant over time. Only a single camera calibration step is
   required at the initial time of assembling and fixing the cameras into
   the array. Preferably the cameras either view from the same position
   through beam splitters, or are fixed close to one another, so that they
   capture approximately the same subject matter. The system is designed so
   the cameras each capture a differently exposed image or video of
   approximately the same subject matter. In one embodiment, two Kinect
   cameras are attached together facing in the same direction, with an ND
   (Neutral Density) filter over one of them, so as to obtain a darker
   exposure. The dark and light exposures are combined to obtain more
   accurate 3D sensing in high contrast scenes. In another embodiment, a
   single 3D camera is exposure-sequenced (alternating light and dark
   exposures).
   3D HDR might, more generally, be incorporated into existing 3D cameras,
   resulting in a new kind of 3D sensor that can work in nearly any
   environment, including high contrast scenes such as outdoor scenes, or
   scenes where a bright light is shining directly into the sensor.}},

Abstract = {{Hospital acquired infections (HAIs) occur frequently in hospitalized
   patients. Staff compliance with hand hygiene (HH) policy during patient
   care has been shown to reduce HAIs. Currently, hospitals evaluate
   adherence to HH policies through direct observation by human auditors.
   The auditors do not have authority over staff members; thus, this
   process is more akin to sousveillance (watching from below) than
   surveillance (watching from above). When behaviour change occurs due to
   awareness of being observed, it is referred to as the ``Hawthorne
   effect{''}. We quantified the effect of sousveillance by comparing the
   frequency of HH events with an auditor present to when no auditor was
   present. The data analysed in the present work is from an ongoing study
   on hand hygiene compliance monitoring.
   A monitoring network recorded 290,000 hand hygiene events over 6 months;
   auditors were present on five occasions for about an hour each visit.
   When using an exponential underlying distribution we found that the
   change in the HH event rate was significant (p < 0.01) in 4 of the 5
   auditor visits. Finally, with a hyper-exponential underlying
   distribution, 5 of 5 were significant (p < 0.01). There was no
   significant change in the HH event rate among dispensers located within
   patient rooms (not visible to the auditor), irrespective of auditor's
   presence.}},

Abstract = {{Ramp metering (PM) is the most effective dynamic traffic measure in
   response to growing congestion in urban freeway networks. Among the
   extensive RM methods available, those based on optimal control theory
   have shown strong potential in improving freeway performance. However,
   these algorithms require an accurate traffic model that limits their
   applicability in practice. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides the
   tools to achieve optimal RM control without reliance on any traffic
   model. In this paper, a guideline for designing RM control systems based
   on RL is presented by testing different states' representations,
   learning methods, action selection, and reward definitions. A
   microscopic simulation test bed based on a portion of Highway 401 in
   Toronto, Canada, is developed to evaluate each of the above design
   parameters and quantify various PM control strategies. A comparison of
   the reinforcement learning ramp-metering (RLRM) algorithm with a
   modified version of ALINEA shows the potential of RLRM to improve
   freeway traffic conditions. When applied to the developed case study,
   the proposed RLRM algorithm and modified ALMA reduce the total travel
   time by 40\% and 20\%, respectively, compared with the case with no RM.}},

Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD}},
Year = {{2013}},
Number = {{2398}},
Pages = {{50-59}},
Abstract = {{A recent study developed a set of zone-level negative binomial collision
   prediction models to investigate the relationship between various
   transportation and sociodemographic characteristics and overall roadway
   safety. The developed models used data from Metro Vancouver, British
   Columbia, Canada, and considered the effect of Poisson variations and
   heterogeneity (extra variation) on collision occurrence. This study aims
   to evaluate spatial effects on the occurrence of collisions and to check
   whether the inclusion of spatial variables can improve the goodness of
   fit and inference capability of those previously developed prediction
   models. Transit-reliant and application-based collision prediction
   models with spatial correlations were developed by using the WinBUGS
   software. The convergence of the developed models was tested by trace
   plots of the parameter estimated, the Brooks-Gelman-Rubin statistics,
   and ratios of Monte Carlo errors relative to the standard deviations of
   the estimates. The results showed that incorporation of the spatial
   correlations affected the parameter estimates, the values of dispersion
   parameters and intercepts, and also the t-statistics. The effect of the
   main exposure variable on all of the models for total, severe, and
   property-damage-only collisions was found to be smaller under spatial
   models. The smaller values of the exponents of the main exposure
   variable confirmed the assumption that spatial effects need to be
   considered in collision prediction models to mitigate any potential bias
   associated with model misspecification.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene is a promising material for many applications, and
   electromagnetic modeling for graphene is needed to aid the design of
   graphene based devices. We present an approach for the finite-difference

   boundary conditions (SIBC) to model graphene as a surface, eliminating
   the need to simulate the interior of the material. The vector-fitting
   technique is used in conjunction with FDTD to achieve accurate response
   over a broad range of frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we propose a method for generating terahertz signals using
   a 2D array of nonlinear right-handed unit cells for harmonic generation,
   combined with a matched array of left-handed unit cells for both
   filtering and focusing the desired harmonic frequency component. The
   nonlinear array can be driven by a single sinusoidal source, or by
   multiple coherent sources, in which case the array topology acts as an
   input power combiner. The proposed structure is suited to monolithic
   fabrication and integration with other system components. Performance
   characterisation of the proposed structure is demonstrated using
   transient simulations of an LC-based structure with AMOS varactors,
   achieving around 2\% to 3\% conversion efficiency at 450 GHz for a 1 V
   input at 150 GHz.}},

Abstract = {{Reflector antennas realized by reflectarrays have many attractive
   features that are unmatched by traditional reflectors. Low-profile
   planar reflectarrays can be made to have high gain and electronic beam
   steering. However, they tend to use elements operating near their
   resonant frequencies for achieving a large phase range, thus limiting
   their bandwidth significantly. Transformation optics (TO) offers a new
   way to design tunable reflecting devices while preserving many of the
   attractive features of a reflectarray antenna. The TO device
   accomplishes beam collimation by using a 2-D array of sub- wavelength
   dipoles, which is macroscopically seen as an effective medium, to incur
   different phase changes of the incident fields. The proposed reflector
   has a relative gain bandwidth of 150\%.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectric media that exhibit dipole relaxation under an externally
   applied electromagnetic field are commonly described by the causal Debye
   model. Such media support the formation and propagation of the Brillouin
   precursor, which propagates with the phase velocity at dc and has an
   algebraic attenuation rate of its peak amplitude. This interesting
   property points to several applications of Brillouin precursors for
   communications and imaging through lossy dispersive media. This paper
   explores the possibility of pursuing such applications with acoustic
   pulses. To that end, a recently proposed causal model for viscoacoustic
   media, which can be interpreted as an extension of the Debye model, is
   employed to illuminate the analogies and discrepancies between acoustic
   and electromagnetic precursor fields.}},

Abstract = {{A method for squint-free arbitrary-angle broadband beamforming in
   series-fed antenna arrays is introduced. This method originates from the
   idea of loading a feedline with non-Foster elements. This type of
   loading reduces the per unit length inductance and capacitance of the
   transmission line and a fast-wave non-dispersive propagation, required
   for squintfree beamforming in series-fed antenna arrays, is obtained.
   Importantly, the challenges associated with traditional implementations
   of non-Foster reactive elements (e. g. stability) are circumvented by
   introducing a new methodology using negativegroup-delay (NGD) networks.
   This method is established by showing that non-Foster reactive elements
   and NGD networks influence propagating waves in a similar manner.
   Subsequently, a series feeding network for linear antenna arrays is
   designed by loading a host transmission line with loss-compensated NGD
   networks. In summary, this paper introduces a new method for
   synthesizing stable non-Foster reactances, using NGD networks, which is
   utilized to present a solution to the beam squinting problem in
   series-fed antenna arrays.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, user context information has been utilized for efficient and
   effective network and service management. In this situation, there is a
   strong need to collect user context information. One of the proprietary
   methods to collect user context information is to use sensors equipped
   inside a smartphone such as accelerometer, gyroscope, digital compass,
   and microphone. However, user context collection on a smartphone easily
   leads to rapid drain of the smartphone battery. To overcome the problem,
   this paper proposes a novel user context information collection model
   for efficient smartphone battery management. This model is based on two
   strategies: scheduling and dynamic sensor reconfiguration. The proposed
   model is implemented on Galaxy Nexus Android smartphone. The Performance
   evaluation shows that the proposed model reduces the energy consumption
   by a ratio of 42 percent compared to the current periodic sensor reading
   model.}},

Abstract = {{he volume of global IP traffic is expected to exponentially grow because
   of the increasing consumption of multimedia contents and the increasing
   usage of mobile devices. To cost-effectively handle the data traffic
   explosion, Content-Centric Networking (CCN) was proposed as an
   alternative to the traditional IP networking. A CCN's basic data
   transport method is pull-based but some of applications require a
   push-based method as well; there are three different approaches to
   support push in CCN. In this paper, we propose a bandwidth consumption
   model of the CCN-based pull and three push methods and evaluate
   bandwidth performances of them using the proposed model.}},

Abstract = {{It is well known that cells respond to structured surface cues that are
   on the micro/nanometer scale. Tissue engineering and bio-fouling fields
   have utilized the semiconductor device fabrication processes to make
   micro- and nanometer patterned surfaces to study animal cell tissue
   formation and to prevent algae attachment on marine surfaces
   respectively. In this paper we describe the use of micro-structured
   surfaces to study the attachment and growth of algal films This paper
   gives an overview of how micro-structured surfaces are made for this
   purpose, how they are incorporated into a photo bioreactor and how this
   patterning influences the growth of an algal biofilm. Our results
   suggest that surface patterning with deeper V-groove patterns that are
   of the same size scale as the algal species has resulted in higher
   biomass productivity giving them a chance to embed and attach on the
   slope and flat surfaces whereas shallower size grooves and completely
   flat surfaces did not show this trend.}},

Abstract = {{Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds offer diverse pricing options,
   including on-demand and reserved instances with various discounts to
   attract different cloud users. A practical problem facing cloud users is
   how to minimize their costs by choosing among different pricing options
   based on their own demands. In this paper, we propose a new cloud
   brokerage service that reserves a large pool of instances from cloud
   providers and serves users with price discounts. The broker optimally
   exploits both pricing benefits of long-term instance reservations and
   multiplexing gains. We propose dynamic strategies for the broker to make
   instance reservations with the objective of minimizing its service cost.
   These strategies leverage dynamic programming and approximate algorithms
   to rapidly handle large volumes of demand. Our extensive simulations
   driven by large-scale Google cluster-usage traces have shown that
   significant price discounts can be realized via the broker.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the tele-operation of a mobile sensor platform. In
   current operations, this land vehicle is controlled by a team consisting
   of a driver and a sensor operator. Our experiment is the first attempt,
   for this system, to assess the impact, if any, of using a single
   operator versus a team of two operators, in order to inform staffing
   decisions as well as the design of future automated functions. The
   experiment was conducted using a simulator and 24 participants: 8 single
   operators and 8 teams of two operators. Lower mission completion times
   arose for the two-operator condition in spite of any extra time and
   workload generated by communication required. Operators in teams also
   assessed the system as more usable. These findings give support to the
   team strategy for tele-operating mobile sensor platforms, and have
   implications for the staffing and design of similarly complex
   uninhabited vehicle systems.}},

Abstract = {{Transit infrastructure is under pressure. As the trends toward greater
   urbanization and more sustainable mobility continue, that pressure is
   likely to increase. Finding ways to accommodate passengers more
   efficiently in existing transit facilities will become of ever greater
   importance, as will the tools and techniques to assess pedestrian
   movement. The suite of pedestrian analysis tools is reliant on first
   principles knowledge and research, where gaps exist. This paper
   describes research that has been completed to fill one such gap, namely
   rider choice at vertical circulation. First, field research was
   conducted on the Toronto Transit Commission subway system in Canada. Key
   explanatory variables were then tested for significance, including total
   height, density of flow, rate of opposing flow, and mobility of the
   individuals. On the basis of this analysis, a series of aggregate
   logistic regression models is proposed to explain pedestrian choice at
   colocated elements of vertical transport, specifically,
   stair-versus-escalator choice. Validation data indicate that the model
   generates values that provide a good fit with observed data.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of increasing
   parking charges at park-and-ride stations on mode choice for current
   park-and-ride users. To address this objective, a stated preference (SP)
   survey was designed to study commuters' willingness to pay for parking
   at park-and-ride transit stations. The SP survey was conducted at the 14
   busiest park-and-ride transit stations in Greater Vancouver in British
   Columbia, Canada. The survey data were then used to model mode choice
   for longer-distance commuting trips by considering three major options:
   automobile all-way, transit all-way, and park-and-ride. A
   heteroscedastic multinomial logit model for stated preference of modal
   choices was estimated. The model included several major factors that
   were found to influence mode choice at park-and-ride stations. The
   estimated model parameters were then used to investigate direct and
   cross elasticities of parking charges at park-and-ride stations to mode
   choices. The model results show that an increase in parking charges at
   park-and-ride stations is more likely to divert current park-and-ride
   users to the transit all-way option compared with the private car
   all-way option.}},

Abstract = {{Middleboxes are widely deployed in today's data-center networks. They
   perform a variety of network functions, each requiring multiple hardware
   resources, such as CPU cycles and link bandwidth. Depending on the
   functions they go through, packet processing of different traffic flows
   may consume a vastly different amount of hardware resources. An
   effective algorithm is therefore highly desired to schedule packets in a
   way such that multiple resources are shared in a fair and efficient
   manner. However, we show in this paper that there exists a
   fairness-efficiency tradeoff when multiple resources are scheduled. Such
   a tradeoff has never been a problem for traditional single-resource fair
   queueing (e. g., GPS, WFQ, SCFQ, DRR) - as long as the queueing schemes
   are work conserving, both fairness and efficiency can be achieved
   simultaneously - and hence has received little attention. Therefore, a
   new and important research problem arises: given a desired
   fairness-efficiency tradeoff, how can we design a packet scheduling
   algorithm to reinforce such a tradeoff? We present our thoughts and
   observations in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Due to the existence of security threats in the cloud, many mechanisms
   have been proposed to allow a user to audit data integrity with the
   public key of the data owner before utilizing cloud data. The
   correctness of choosing the right public key in previous mechanisms
   depends on the security of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and
   certificates. Although traditional PKI has been widely used in the
   construction of public key cryptography, it still faces many security
   risks, especially in the aspect of managing certificates. In this paper,
   we design a certificateless public auditing mechanism to eliminate the
   security risks introduced by PKI in previous solutions. Specifically,
   with our mechanism, a public verifier does not need to manage
   certificates to choose the right public key for the auditing. Instead,
   the auditing can be operated with the assistance of the data owner's
   identity, such as her name or email address, which can ensure the right
   public key is used. Meanwhile, this public verifier is still able to
   audit data integrity without retrieving the entire data from the cloud
   as previous solutions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first
   certificateless public auditing mechanism for verifying data integrity
   in the cloud. Our theoretical analyses prove that our mechanism is
   correct and secure, and our experimental results show that our mechanism
   is able to audit the integrity of data in the cloud efficiently.}},

Abstract = {{The detection performance of high frequency over-the-horizon radar (HF
   OTHR) systems is heavily influenced by the presence of radar clutter
   that originates by Bragg backscatter from plasma structures in the
   aurora zone, denoted as auroral clutter. The work in {[}1] developed a
   data model for the clutter seen by HF OTHR system. The model uses a
   geometric optics approach to determine the power spectral density (PSD)
   of the radar signal phase as a function of space and Doppler. However,
   in that approach the space-Doppler spectrum focuses on a single
   transmit-receive ray path. This, in turn, forces the clutter to occupy a
   very narrow notch in Doppler. This issue was addressed in {[}1] by
   multiplying the resulting clutter signal with a series of random Doppler
   shifts per pulse thereby introducing a Doppler spread in the clutter. In
   this paper we present an extension of this model for auroral clutter
   wherein the clutter is modelled as a superposition of multiple rays each
   of which, individually, satisfies the model in {[}1]. The paper also
   addresses the modelling of the target return that is not addressed in
   {[}1]. The target model presented here uses the power spectrum approach
   to estimate the angle-Doppler spread due to signal propagation through
   the ionosphere.}},

Abstract = {{To initiate our simulations of canine left ventricle (LV) mechanics, we
   needed to specify an initial geometry and an initial wall stress
   distribution. Although there are sufficient measurements of LV
   geometries, there are no assessments of stresses under any conditions.
   To estimate a physiologically plausible range of stresses at end
   diastole, we have inflated an unloaded reference geometry using static
   pressure loads. The LV was modelled as a six-layered truncated prolate
   ellipsoid. The myocardium was defined as a slightly compressible,
   transversely isotropic, hyperelastic material. The reference LV was
   inflated statically by gradually increasing the pressure on its inner
   surface until an end-diastolic state was reached. The calculated
   dependence of normalized LV volume changes on the applied pressure was
   in good agreement with previous experimental results. Our calculated
   geometry was found to be comparable to previous measurements. The
   end-diastolic stresses were found to have complex variations, which
   cannot be determined by adopting an ad hoc stress-free, end-diastolic
   geometry. The calculated geometry and stress distribution are deemed to
   be suitable for use as initial states for cardiac cycle simulations.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular systems are designed such that a certain amount of radio
   spectrum is allocated for their exclusive use to ensure that
   interference within these systems is tightly controlled. For competitive
   reasons, spectrum is divided between operators despite the resulting
   inefficiency in the overall spectrum utilization. For systems with
   relatively large cells and significant number of users per cell the loss
   in efficiency is modest. However, losses can become very large as cells
   become smaller. This paper presents a cooperative spectrum access
   framework that enables spectrum sharing between small cells that are
   being deployed by different operators. Primary spectrum owning operators
   broadcast their spectrum occupancy information to allow small cells of
   other operators to access their spectrum as secondary users.
   LTE-Advanced systems employing small cells are considered. Simulations
   show that the proposed spectrum access framework enables small cells to
   achieve substantial performance gains without affecting the primary
   spectrum owning operator even when the small cell deployment density
   varies significantly between operators.}},

   manipulated using random dot patterns on a simulated real object
   surface, by manipulating dot size, dot density, and whether or not
   objects placed behind the surface were partially occluded by the

Abstract = {{This paper introduces and evaluates a new method for the small-signal
   stability enhancement of large ac power systems based on segmentation
   through line-commutated HVDC links. The proposed method is based on the
   fact that the oscillatory modes of the system may vary by changing the
   system operating point. In this study, the system operating point is
   varied by rerouting the flow of power in the ac transmission lines. The
   flexibility of the HVDC lines in controlling the flow of power in a
   dc-segmented ac system is used to control the power transmission in the
   ac lines. An optimization problem is proposed to determine the optimum
   set-points of the HVDC lines to increase the damping ratio of the
   underdamped oscillatory modes. Simulation results show that at the
   optimum operating point, the low-frequency oscillatory modes are damped
   out significantly and the system net oscillation is less than that of
   the system at the operating point obtained from a standard economic
   dispatch. Simulation results also show that there is a trade-off between
   the generation cost and damping ratio and the proposed method
   effectively enhances the small-signal stability for a variety of system
   configurations.}},

Abstract = {{Autonomous capabilities for manipulating randomly piled objects may
   enhance current methods of path planning and open a new field of
   development for mobile manipulation and Urban Search And Rescue (USAR)
   robotics. This paper introduces the challenge of achieving such
   manipulation capabilities and as a first step presents three algorithms,
   including a proposed novel solution, for the selection of objects to
   remove from a pile. The proposed algorithm determines a removability
   rank for each object according to the degree of its encapsulation within
   other objects. Using the contact vectors of the examined object, it is
   possible to obtain the motions that will not violate the object's
   unilateral contact constraints. The removability rank of the object is
   proportional to the union of all such motions. All algorithms were
   tested in simulation in full and partial knowledge modes, and evaluated
   on a physical robot with a simple manipulator and sensor. This work
   contributes: the introduction of an important autonomous manipulation
   challenge, the solution of which will be useful in the field of
   manipulation in general and USAR in particular; a specific novel
   algorithm for the construction of disassembly plans for piled objects;
   and an experimental evaluation of three algorithms targeted at such

Abstract = {{A validation of a closed-loop system-on-chip (SoC) for epilepsy
   treatment is presented. A 12mm(2) 0.13 mu m CMOS SoC provides the
   functionality of neural recording, neural stimulation and early seizure
   detection based on the bivariate phase synchrony estimation algorithm.
   The SoC can operate in a closed loop, has 64 neural recording and 64
   neural stimulation channels, and dissipates 1.4mW and 1.5mW across 64
   channels for neural recording and stimulation, respectively. Two in vivo
   experiments with freely moving rats based on a non-convulsive and
   convulsive seizure model are presented. The first in vivo experiment
   validates the results by comparing the output of the SoC with a SIMULINK
   model of the implant. The second in vivo experiment validates the SoC in
   early seizure detection and as a closed-loop intractable epilepsy
   treatment with 80 percent efficacy. Long Evans rats are used for all
   experiments. All data are cross-validated by a conventional benchtop
   amplifier.}},

   grid electrodes from patients with extratemporal lobe epilepsy,
   measuring interelectrode wavelet phase coherence (WPC), between
   neighbouring and distant cortical areas, during interictal and ictal
   activity. As several studies have explored phase coherence in the
   epileptic brain, in relation to lower rhythms (< 80 Hz), we have applied
   WPC analysis to both slow and fast neuronal rhythms-in the 1400 Hz
   frequency range-to study their respective temporal and spatial coherence
   patterns. In analyzing the WPC profiles generated from all possible
   electrode pairings, two prominent patterns of phase coherence were
   observed in select electrode pairings on the implanted patient grids:
   during interictal activity, strong coherence was observed in the 8-11 Hz
   frequency range, while increased coherence was observed in activity > 80
   Hz during seizure episodes. Furthermore, electrodes on the grid with
   elevated coherence in faster rhythms during seizures showed overlap with
   areas possessing elevated low-frequency coherence during interictal
   activity. As several studies have identified ictal fast activities as
   possible seizure biomarkers, the interictal coherence patterns observed
   here may also help in defining seizure-related regions of interest in
   the epileptic brain.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a segmented IGBT gate driver IC for mitigating IGBT
   turn-on I-C over-shoot is presented. The proposed IC is fabricated using
   TSMC's 0.18 mu m BCD Gen-2 process. Unlike existing I-C over-shoot
   reduction techniques, the proposed technique does not require
   significant additional external components or an increase in turn-on
   energy. During turn-on, the gate driver is controlled such that
   (dV(GE)/dt) is kept low as current is transferred from the FWD to the
   IGBT and kept high at all other times. The ideal timing of (dV(GE)/dt)
   transitions could vary between IGBT devices, age, temperature, etc. A
   feedback system is used to correct for these variances. A 37\% reduction
   in IC overshoot is achieved while maintaining the same E-ON. A 54\%
   reduction in EON is achieved for the same I-C overshoot. Finally, a 15.5
   dBm reduction in CEMI is observed when compared to operation with a
   constant R-OUT and similar E-ON.}},

Abstract = {{The study reported herein considered three questionnaires available for
   assessing learning styles, viz., Kolb, Honey-Alonso, and Felder-Soloman.
   The questionnaires were implemented in a spreadsheet with automated
   results, and distributed to subjects of both genders, and varying age,
   and academic background. The aim of the work was to determine which
   questionnaire, if any, would be preferred by respondents. The
   respondents were asked to answer all three questionnaires, examine the
   results and indicate their satisfaction by grading each result, using a
   scale between 0 and 10. While the results given by each questionnaire do
   not allow a complete comparison, partial agreement was possible to
   identify. Answers provided by 52 respondents have been processed, which
   show that, while there is no statistically significant difference among
   the preference of respondents regarding the three options, a slight
   preference for the Felder-Soloman questionnaire is discernible.}},

Abstract = {{A fault-tolerant control scheme for a class of nonlinear systems subject
   to actuator faults and system disturbances is proposed and analyzed.
   Fault and state estimates are generated by an H-infinity sliding mode
   observer, making them more robust to disturbances. They are used to form
   an output feedback controller that suppresses the effects of faults and
   disturbances, resulting in an integrated fault tolerant control design.
   Stability of the closed loop system is proved using Lyapunov analysis.
   The integrated fault tolerant control design is applied to a permanent
   magnet synchronous motor. Simulation results demonstrate that with the
   enhanced robustness of the state and fault estimates to disturbances,
   the proposed controller produces significantly improved closed loop
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the problem of reducing power excursions in
   amplified WDM communication networks with Reconfigurable Optical
   Add-Drop Multiplexers (ROADM). We consider a basic WDM network topology,
   namely, a ROADM-based optically amplified chain network, where each
   ROADM node is equipped with Wavelength Selective Switch (WSS) for
   channel power adjustment. In dynamic network loading scenarios or at
   sudden failures, conventional WSS control strategies lead to transient
   power excursions across the chain. We propose a new WSS coordination
   control strategy that effectively decouples nodes in the chain network
   and reduces WSS transient power excursions across the chain in the event
   of failures or reconfigurations. We provide analytical bounds on these
   reductions as well as experimental results implemented on a Transparent
   Optical Mesh Simulator (ATOM) for two realistic scenarios.}},

Abstract = {{Structured nonorthogonal finite-difference discretisations of Maxwell's
   equations are often employed to model curved dielectric-vacuum
   interfaces. As part of this process, it is necessary to employ a
   suitable procedure to enforce the tangential field continuity conditions
   at the locations of the interfaces where the components of the
   permittivity tensor are discontinuous. This paper presents a
   second-order domain-splitting procedure that can accomplish this task
   without assuming that the permittivity tensor components are piecewise
   constant or diagonal. Such a feature is needed to exploit the full
   geometrical flexibility of structured grids. The proposed procedure
   consistently yields a global error that is second-order accurate even in
   extreme cases where the components of the permittivity tensor have a
   sharp jump or change of sign.}},

   addressed for maximizing the sum capacity at each point of the coverage
   area in a CoMP multi-user downlink. Then, based on targeting the minimum
   value of the maximized sum capacity, a design approach is presented for
   obtaining an optimal size of the cells in a wireless network. The
   approach guarantees that the sum capacity at each point of the coverage
   area is above the target value. The path loss model is pivotal for the
   outcome of this type of performance analysis and the ensuing system
   design. Here, a simplistic, standard path loss model is used, but the

   addresses these concerns and studies the performance of spectrum sharing
   LTE-Advanced systems under different sharing scenarios. Advanced system
   level simulations are performed to measure and compare the performance
   of two LTE-Advanced systems under fixed spectrum allocation and spectrum

Abstract = {{We study a lossy source-broadcasting problem involving the transmission
   of a binary source over a two-receiver erasure broadcast channel. The
   motivation of our work stems from the problem faced by a server that
   wishes to singly broadcast content to a diverse set of users with
   fractional source reconstruction requirements. In this problem, the
   server wishes to minimize the overall network latency incurred (measured
   by the number of channel uses per source symbol) when faced with users
   of heterogeneous channel qualities, computing capabilities, content
   demand etc. We provide two complementary approaches to this problem. The
   first approach is to consider the problem from a joint source-channel
   coding formulation. Under this formulation, we provide both inner and
   outer bounds for the network latency under an erasure distortion
   criterion. Alternatively, the second approach employs rateless coding
   and formulates an optimization problem so as to find a degree
   distribution that minimizes the network latency. We compare both
   approaches with numerical simulations.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates an uplink multi-cell processing (MCP) model
   where the cell sites are linked to a central processor (CP) via
   noiseless backhaul links with limited capacity. A simple
   compress-and-forward scheme is employed, where the base-stations (BSs)
   quantize the received signals and send the quantized signals to the CP
   using distributed Wyner-Ziv compression. The CP decodes the quantization
   codewords first, then decodes the user messages as if the users and the
   CP form a virtual multiple-access channel. This paper formulates the
   problem of maximizing the overall sum rate under a sum backhaul
   constraint for such a setting. It is shown that setting the quantization
   noise levels to be uniform across the BSs maximizes the achievable sum
   rate under high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Further, for general SNR a
   low-complexity fixed-point iteration algorithm is proposed to optimize
   the quantization noise levels. This paper further shows that with
   uniform quantization noise levels, the compress-and-forward scheme with
   Wyner-Ziv compression already achieves a sum rate that is within a
   constant gap to the sum capacity of the uplink MCP model. The gap
   depends linearly on the number of BSs in the network but is independent
   of the SNR and the channel matrix.}},

Abstract = {{Fibrillar collagens are important structural proteins and are known to
   be closely associated with mineral in the case of mineralized tissues.
   However, the precise role of collagen in the mineralization process
   remains unclear, and the evaluation of structural differences in
   collagen from mineralized and nonmineralized tissues may be instructive
   in this regard. Here, we review the use of cryo-transmission electron
   microscopy to investigate the axial structure of collagen fibrils in
   tissue sections from both mineralizing and nonmineralizing tissues. By
   examining collagen fibrillar structure in an unstained frozen-hydrated
   state, it is possible to avoid artifacts normally associated with
   staining and dehydration that are required for conventional TEM. We
   describe both sample preparation and image analysis with emphasis on the
   particular challenges of using image averaging techniques, which can be
   used to overcome the low signal-to-noise ratio that is inherent in this
   technique. Detailed banding patterns can be obtained from averaged
   images, and these can be analyzed to obtain quantitative information on
   fibril periodicity and structure.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a data collection framework and its prototype
   application for personal activity travel surveys through the use of
   smartphone sensors. The core components of the framework run on
   smartphones backed by cloud-based (online) services for data storage,
   information dissemination, and decision support. The framework employs
   machine-learning techniques to infer automatically activity types and
   travel modes with minimum interruption for the respondents. The three
   main components of the framework are (a) 24-h location data collection,
   (b) a dynamic land use database, and (c) a transportation mode
   identification component. The location logger is based on the smartphone
   network and can run for 24 h with minimal impact on smartphone battery
   life. The location logger is applicable equally in places where Global
   Positioning System signals are and are not available. The land use
   information is continuously updated from Internet location services such
   as Foursquare. The transportation mode identification module is able to
   distinguish six modes with 98.85\% accuracy. The prototype application
   is conducted in the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and the results
   clearly indicate the viability of this framework.}},

Abstract = {{Each year during the ninth month of the Muslim lunar calendar, more than
   2 million Muslim pilgrims from around the world travel to the Holy City
   of Mecca in Saudi Arabia for Hajj, an annual religious pilgrimage. A
   significant milestone in the effort to improve the existing transport
   system in the Holy City was the introduction of the Southern Masha'er
   Rail Line during the 2010 pilgrimage season. In the first year of
   operation, the line operated at only 30\% of its full capacity before
   full implementation in the following year, when the line operated at
   full capacity of 72,000 passengers per hour. Results are presented of a
   users' survey that aimed to assess the performance of the rail line from
   the perspective of its users. The analysis revealed that rail users
   faced longer access, waiting, and egress times compared with regular
   rail operations standards. However, survey results showed that the
   majority of pilgrims found these times to be tolerable. Moreover, the
   majority of users found the rail line and its stations to be of
   excellent quality and gave positive recommendations for using the rail
   line in the future. The analysis also produced some interesting
   observations that may be of relevance to rail operation in similar
   crowded events. Those observations are highlighted.}},

Abstract = {{The concept of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) has gained recent interest as more
   and more electric vehicles (EVs) are put to use. In this paper, we
   consider a dynamic aggregator-EVs system, where an aggregator centrally
   coordinates a large number of EVs to perform regulation service. We
   propose a Welfare-Maximizing Regulation Allocation (WMRA) algorithm for
   the aggregator to fairly allocate the regulation amount among the EVs.
   The algorithm operates in real time and does not require any prior
   knowledge on the statistical information of the system. Compared with
   previous works, WMRA accommodates a wide spectrum of vital system
   characteristics, including limited EV battery size, EV self
   charging/discharging, EV battery degradation cost, and the cost of using
   external energy sources. Furthermore, our simulation results indicate
   that WMRA can substantially outperform a suboptimal greedy algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{We design, implement and evaluate a parallel radix sort that
   simultaneously utilizes the CPU and GPU devices on the AMD Fusion APU.
   The parallel sort, referred to as FusionSort, partitions the sort keys
   between the CPU and GPU devices and utilizes the integrated memory
   system of the APU to avoid data copying between the devices. We identify
   three design issues that impact overhead and performance: the
   granularity of sharing between the two devices, the scheme of data
   partitioning and the allocation of data in memory regions accessible by
   each device. We present three variants of FusionSort that share data at
   coarse and fine granularities and with fixed and variable data
   partitioning schemes. In each variant, data is allocated to minimize the

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a novel method for extraction of discriminant
   spatio-spectral EEG features in motor imagery brain-computer interfaces.
   Considering a heteroscedastic binary classification setup, this method
   extracts the spatio-spectral features whose variance is maximized for
   one brain task and minimized for the other task. Therefore, our method
   can be considered as a spatio-spectral generalization of the
   conventional common spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm. In comparison to
   the similar solutions in the literature, such as filter-bank CSP (FBCSP)
   method, the proposed method benefits from joint processing of both
   spatial and spectral features, which improves the overall performance of
   the BCI while reducing its computational cost. Furthermore, our
   algorithm provides a simple measure that allows for ranking the
   discriminant power of extracted spatio-spectral features, which is not
   possible in FBCSP method. The experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed method outperforms FBCSP for both raw EEG and preprocessed EEG
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Linear discriminant, analysis (LDA) is a commonly-used feature
   extraction technique. For matrix-variate data such as spatio-spectral
   electroencephalogram (EEG), matrix-variate LDA formulations have been
   proposed. Compared to the standard vector-variate LDA, these
   formulations assume a separable structure for the within-class and
   between-class scatter matrices; these structured parameters can be
   estimated more accurately with a limited number of training samples.
   However, separable scatters do not fit some data, resulting in
   aggravated performance for matrix-variate methods. This paper first
   proposes a common framework for the vector-variate LDA with
   non-separable scatters and our previously proposed solution with
   separable scatters. Then, a regularization of the non-separable scatter
   estimates toward the separable estimates is introduced. This novel
   regularized framework integrates vector-variate and matrix-variate
   approaches, and allows the estimated scatter matrices to adapt to the
   data characteristics. Experiments on data set V from BCI competition III
   demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a considerable
   classification performance gain.}},

Abstract = {{A new multi-stage approach based on component extraction is proposed to
   more efficiently address the sparse representation problem. In each
   stage a pre-set number of coefficients are chosen for reconstructing
   each signal component. A global search is performed to extract a lower
   dimensional sub-dictionary consisting of a sorted set of candidate atoms
   to represent the signal component, corresponding to the stage. The best
   representing atoms are then selected from the sub dictionary using the
   Matching Pursuit (MP) method. Afterwards, the sparse coefficients are
   updated in the same manner in which the Orthogonal Matching Pursuit
   (OMP) operates. The proposed method is more efficient that the
   conventional OMP methods. To evaluate the performance of the proposed
   method, it is compared to OMP and Stagewise OMP (StOMP), which are
   conceptually the most similar to the proposed approach. The results
   illustrate the proposed method is more time efficient than OMP and more
   robust and sparser than the StOMP.}},

   extraction and matching are performed in Euclidean spaces. However,
   there are many scenarios (e. g., biometric template encryption for

   feature vectors. The main contribution of this paper is a
   Hamming-distance classifier for ECG biometrics based on SPEC-Hashing.
   The proposed system was evaluated over a database of ECG signals from 52
   different subjects that were collected at the Biometrics Security
   Laboratory of the University of Toronto. The EER of the Hamming-distance
   classifier was found to be 5.5\% for closed-set matching and 14.82\% for

Abstract = {{Huygens surfaces are a recently proposed way of manipulating
   electromagnetic wavefronts using a superposition of subwavelength
   electric and magnetic dipoles situated on a plane. This allows for
   interesting phenomena such as refraction, beam manipulation, and
   focusing using this planar screen. In this letter, a circuit model for
   the unit cells comprising a Huygens surface is proposed to further
   understand the functionality of this screen. The equivalent circuit is a
   lattice network whose constituent series and shunt impedances correspond
   to the impedances of the magnetic and electric dipoles, respectively. We
   demonstrate that the corresponding voltage and current terminal
   relations across the lattice network correspond exactly to the
   electromagnetic boundary conditions across the Huygens surfaces. We also
   show how this model can be used to design the required unit cells and,
   using a two-dimensional circuit solver, how these lattice cells can be
   used to model an entire Huygens surface.}},

Abstract = {{Spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data suffer from scintillation
   due to changes in the signal path when travelling through the dispersive
   ionosphere. During data collection, scintillation translates into phase
   noise in the received signals, which in turn leads to smearing in the
   resulting image. This article examines ways of reducing
   ionosphere-induced smearing in high-resolution spotlight SAR data. In
   this article, several existing techniques are reviewed and one technique
   is tested using simulated spotlight data with ionospheric phase noise.
   The results show that the existing techniques are ineffective in
   correcting spatially varying ionospheric phase noise. Hence, a 2D phase
   reconstruction and compensation technique is developed, which results in
   a 10\% reduction in the main lobe in simulated data. This technique is
   also demonstrated to sharpen images using measured data obtained from
   the TerraSAR-X satellite mission.}},

Abstract = {{Transcriptome complexity and its relation to numerous diseases underpins
   the need to predict in silico splice variants and the regulatory
   elements that affect them. Building upon our recently described splicing
   code, we developed AVISPA, a Galaxy-based web tool for splicing
   prediction and analysis. Given an exon and its proximal sequence, the
   tool predicts whether the exon is alternatively spliced, displays
   tissue-dependent splicing patterns, and whether it has associated
   regulatory elements. We assess AVISPA's accuracy on an independent
   dataset of tissue-dependent exons, and illustrate how the tool can be
   applied to analyze a gene of interest. AVISPA is available at

Pages = {{1950-1958}},
Abstract = {{Permeable pavements (PPs) have been in use as stormwater management
   systems in Canada and the United States for over 20 years. After years
   of exposure to sediment and debris build-up, surface clogging reduces
   the infiltration of stormwater and inhibits the hydraulic and
   environmental functions of the pavement. Removal of surface material has
   been shown to restore infiltration but the majority of studies have been
   limited to small-scale testing. This paper presents the results of
   small- and full-sized equipment testing aimed at restoring surface
   permeability, including the first testing of regenerative-air and
   vacuum-sweeping streetsweepers in Ontario. Maintenance achieved partial
   restoration of PP surface permeability. Post-treatment surface
   infiltration rates displayed large spatial variability, highlighting
   that localized conditions throughout the pavement have a confounding
   influence on the overall effectiveness of maintenance. The impact of
   maintenance may be improved by establishing regular cleaning intervals
   and developing instructional guidelines for pavement owners and

Abstract = {{Vehicular ad hoc networks are expected to provide a reliable networking
   platform for cooperative safety communication systems. Those systems are
   of a broadcast nature and require to deliver both safety messages and
   vehicle tracking information while being interfered by other types of
   lower priority messages on the same channel. Vehicle tracking
   information are necessary to enable safety communication systems and
   intelligent transportation systems. Due to the large number of
   communicating vehicles and the amount of traffic exchanged in the
   broadcast mode, network congestion often occurs in vehicular
   communication systems. In this paper, a new methodology for avoiding
   such a network congestion is proposed. We identify the sparsity of the
   vehicle tracking information and propose a novel information recovery
   scheme. The proposed scheme reduces the amount of data exchanged due to
   vehicle tracking packets while providing a robust information reception
   at the receivers. Essentially, it utilizes compressive sensing to
   transmit a few measurements of the vehicles velocity vector that allows
   perfect recovery of the original vector at the receiver with a minimal
   error. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of
   applying compressive sensing in recovering vehicles tracking
   information, and relieving the network from unnecessary congestion due
   to the large amount of data exchanged.}},

Abstract = {{Virtualized data centers host multiple applications with distinct
   objectives in a shared infrastructure. Accommodating several dynamic
   applications in virtual data centers is a challenging task for cloud
   providers. Current provisioning solutions focus on a limited set of
   objectives that may not be suited for the increasing number of
   applications deployed in data centers everyday. In this paper we propose
   an adaptive provisioning architecture for virtualized data centers based
   on allocation paradigms. A paradigm translates high-level application
   goals to objectives, allocator instances, and actions that actually
   provision customized virtual infrastructures to applications. A paradigm
   policy language is defined to express the relationship between
   paradigms, objectives, and actions. A performance evaluation of the
   proposed approach considers four main aspects: acceptance ratio,
   provisioning cost, and CPU and link utilization. Simulation results show
   that our proposal is able to select the most appropriate set of
   allocation actions based on the particularities of the applications.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate radiation of a dipole at or below the interface of
   (an)isotropic Epsilon Near Zero (ENZ) media, akin to the classic problem
   of a dipole above a dielectric half-space. To this end, the radiation
   patterns of dipoles at the interface of air and a general anisotropic
   medium (or immersed inside the medium) are derived using the Lorentz
   reciprocity method. By using an ENZ half-space, air takes on the role of
   the denser medium. Thus we obtain shaped radiation patterns in air which
   were only previously attainable inside the dielectric half-space. We
   then follow the early work of Collin on anisotropic artificial
   dielectrics which readily enables the implementation of practical
   anisotropic ENZs by simply stacking sub-wavelength periodic bi-layers of
   metal and dielectric at optical frequencies. We show that when such a
   realistic anisotropic ENZ has a low longitudinal permittivity, the
   desired shaped radiation patterns are achieved in air. In such cases the
   radiation is also much stronger in air than in the ENZ media, as air is
   the denser medium. Moreover, we investigate the subtle differences of
   the dipolar patterns when the anisotropic ENZ dispersion is either
   elliptic or hyperbolic.}},

Abstract = {{We study supervisor localization for real-time discrete-event systems
   (DES) in the Brandin-Wonham timed supervisory control framework. We view
   a real-time DES as comprised of asynchronous agents which are coupled
   through imposed logical and temporal specifications; the essence of
   supervisor localization is the decomposition of monolithic (global)
   control action into local control strategies for the individual agents.
   This study extends our previous work on supervisor localization for
   untimed DES, in that monolithic timed control action typically includes
   not only disabling action as in the untimed case, but also ``clock
   preempting{''} action which enforces prescribed temporal behavior. The
   latter action is executed by a class of special events, called
   ``forcible{''} events; and accordingly, we localize monolithic
   preemptive action with respect to these events. We demonstrate the new
   features of timed supervisor localization on a manufacturing cell case
   study, and discuss a distributed control implementation.}},

Title = {{On the Relationship between Multicast/Broadcast Throughput and Resource
   Utilizations in Wireless Mesh Networks}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Abstract = {{This paper deals with the problem of multicast/broadcast throughput in
   multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks that suffer from the
   resource constraints. We provide a formulation to capture the
   utilization of the network resources and derive analytical relationships
   for the network's throughput in terms of the node utilization, the
   channel utilization, and the number of transmissions. Our model relies
   on the on-demand quality of service multicast/broadcast sessions, where
   each admitted session creates a unique tree with a specific bandwidth.
   As an advantage, the derived relationships are independent of the type
   of tree built for each session and can be used for different protocols.
   The proposed formulation considers the channel assignment strategy and
   reflects both the wireless broadcast advantage and the interference
   constraint. We also offer a comprehensive discussion to evaluate the
   effects of load-balancing and number of transmissions on the network's
   throughput. Numerical results confirm the accuracy of the presented
   analysis.}},

   end result is a system that can process an initial user query, ask
   pertinent questions, and to deduce reasonable medical conclusions.
   Although several example output conversations are shown, the medical
   accuracy of the diagnosis is not the focus of this paper. Instead this
   paper focuses on the system level infrastructure and methodology for

Abstract = {{The location of active users is an important factor in the performance
   analysis of mobile multicell networks, but it is difficult to quantify
   due to the wide variety of user mobility and session patterns. In
   particular, the channel holding times in each cell may be arbitrarily
   distributed and dependent on those in other cells. In this work, we
   study the stationary distribution of users by modeling the system as a
   multi-route queueing network with Poisson inputs. We consider arbitrary
   routing and arbitrary joint probability distributions for the channel
   holding times in each route. Using a decomposition-composition approach,
   we show that the user distribution (1) is insensitive to the user
   movement patterns, (2) is insensitive to general and dependent
   distributed channel holding times, (3) depends only on the average
   arrival rate and average channel holding time at each cell, and (4) is
   completely characterized by an open network with M/M/infinity queues.
   This result is validated by experiments with the Dartmouth user mobility
   traces.}},

   datacenters for better reliability and performance. We consider the
   emerging problem of joint request mapping and response routing with
   distributed datacenters in this paper. We formulate the problem as a
   general workload management optimization. A utility function is used to
   capture various performance goals, and the location diversity of
   electricity and bandwidth costs are realistically modeled. To solve the
   large-scale optimization, we develop a distributed algorithm based on
   the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Following a
   decomposition-coordination approach, our algorithm allows for a parallel
   implementation in a datacenter where each server solves a small
   sub-problem. The solutions are coordinated to find an optimal solution
   to the global problem. Our algorithm converges to near optimum within
   tens of iterations, and is insensitive to step sizes. We empirically
   evaluate our algorithm based on real-world workload traces and latency
   measurements, and demonstrate its effectiveness compared to conventional
   methods.}},

   solutions to such problems rely on primal/dual decomposition and

   large-scale real-time applications. We propose a new iterative approach
   to distributed resource allocation in coupled systems. Without
   complicating message-passing, the new approach is robust to parameter
   choices and expedites convergence by exploiting problem structures. We

Abstract = {{Delivering delay-sensitive data to a group of receivers with minimum
   latency is a fundamental problem for various distributed applications.
   In this paper, we study multicast routing with minimum end-to-end delay
   to the receivers. The delay to each receiver in a multicast tree consist
   of the time that the data spends in overlay links as well as the latency
   incurred at each overlay node, which has to send out a piece of data
   several times over a finite-capacity network connection. The latter
   portion of the delay, which is proportional to the degree of nodes in
   the tree, can be a significant portion of the total delay as we show in
   the paper. Yet, it is often ignored or only partially addressed by
   previous multicast algorithms. We formulate the actual delay to the
   receivers in a multicast tree and consider minimizing the average and
   the maximum delay in the tree. We show the NP-hardness of these problems
   and prove that they cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within
   any reasonable approximation ratio. We then present a number of
   efficient algorithms to build a multicast tree in which the average or
   the maximum delay is minimized. These algorithms cover a wide range of
   overlay sizes for both versions of our problem. The effectiveness of our
   algorithms is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on
   different real-world datasets, and using various overlay network models.
   The results confirm that our algorithms can achieve much lower delays
   (up to 60\% less) and up to orders of magnitude faster running times
   (i.e., supporting larger scales) than previous minimum-delay multicast
   approaches.}},

Abstract = {{A fundamental problem for the delay and backlog analysis across
   multi-hop paths in wireless networks is how to account for the random
   properties of the wireless channel. Since the usual statistical models
   for radio signals in a propagation environment do not lend themselves
   easily to a description of the available service rate, the performance
   analysis of wireless networks has resorted to higher-layer abstractions,
   e. g., using Markov chain models. In this work, we propose a network
   calculus that can incorporate common statistical models of fading
   channels and obtain statistical bounds on delay and backlog across
   multiple nodes. We conduct the analysis in a transfer domain, which we
   refer to as the SNR domain, where the service process at a link is
   characterized by the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio at the
   receiver. We discover that, in the transfer domain, the network model is
   governed by a dioid algebra, which we refer to as (min, x) algebra.
   Using this algebra we derive the desired delay and backlog bounds. An
   application of the analysis is demonstrated for a simple multi-hop
   network with Rayleigh fading channels.}},

Abstract = {{In a secondary spectrum market, the utility of a secondary user often
   depends on not only whether it wins, but also which channels it wins.
   Combinatorial auctions are a natural fit here to allow secondary users
   to bid for combinations of channels. In this context, the VCG mechanism
   constitutes a generic auction that uniquely guarantees both truthfulness
   and efficiency, but it is vulnerable to shill bidding and generates low
   revenue. In this paper, without compromising efficiency, we propose to
   design core-selecting auctions instead, which resolves VCG's
   vulnerability and improves seller revenue. We prove that in a secondary
   spectrum market, the revenue gleaned from a core-selecting auction is at
   least that of the VCG mechanism, and shills are not profitable to
   bidders. Employing linear programming and quadratic programming
   techniques, we design two payment rules suitable for our core-selecting
   auction, which aim to minimize the incentives of bidders to deviate from
   truthful-telling. Our extensive simulation results show that the
   revenues can be largely increased due to spectrum sharing.}},

Abstract = {{In distributed storage systems, a substantial volume of data are stored
   in a distributed fashion, across a large number of storage nodes. To
   maintain data integrity, when existing storage nodes fail, lost data are
   regenerated at replacement nodes. Regenerating multiple data losses in
   batches can reduce the consumption of bandwidth. However, existing
   schemes are only able to achieve lower bandwidth consumption by
   utilizing a large number of participating nodes. In this paper, we
   propose a cooperative pipelined regeneration process that regenerates
   multiple data losses cooperatively with much fewer participating nodes.
   We show that cooperative pipelined regeneration is not only able to
   maintain optimal data integrity, but also able to further reduce the
   consumption of bandwidth as well.}},

Abstract = {{Capacity and buffer sizes are critical design parameters in schedulers
   which multiplex many flows. Previous studies show that in an asymptotic
   regime, when the number of traffic flows N goes to infinity, the choice
   of scheduling algorithm does not have a big impact on performance. We
   raise the question whether or not the choice of scheduling algorithm
   impacts the capacity and buffer sizing for moderate values of N (e.g.,
   few hundred). For Markov-modulated On-Off sources and for finite N, we
   show that the choice of scheduling is influential on (1) buffer overflow
   probability, (2) capacity provisioning, and (3) the viability of network
   decomposition in a non-asymptotic regime. This conclusion is drawn based
   on numerical examples and by a comparison of the scaling properties of
   different scheduling algorithms. In particular, we show that the
   per-flow capacity converges to the per-flow long-term average rate of
   the arrivals with convergence speeds ranging from O (root logN/N) to O
   (1/N) depending on the scheduling algorithm. This speed of convergences
   of the required capacities for different schedulers (to meet a target
   buffer overflow probability) is perceptible even for moderate values of
   N in our numerical examples.}},

Abstract = {{We study low-delay error correction codes for streaming recovery over a
   class of packet-erasure channels that introduce both burst-erasures and
   isolated erasures. We propose a simple, yet effective class of codes
   whose parameters can be tuned to obtain a tradeoff between the
   capability to correct burst and isolated erasures. Our construction
   generalizes previously proposed low-delay codes which are effective only
   against burst erasures.
   We establish an information theoretic upper bound on the capability of
   any code to simultaneously correct burst and isolated erasures and show
   that our proposed constructions meet the upper bound in some special
   cases. We discuss the operational significance of column-distance and
   column-span metrics and establish that the rate 1/2 codes discovered by
   Martinian and Sundberg {[}IT Trans. 2004] through a computer search
   indeed attain the optimal column-distance and column-span tradeoff.
   Numerical simulations over a Gilbert-Elliott channel model and a
   Fritchman model show significant performance gains over previously

Abstract = {{With data services in the cloud, users can easily modify and share data
   as a group. To ensure data integrity can be audited publicly, users need
   to compute signatures on all the blocks in shared data. Different blocks
   are signed by different users due to data modifications performed by
   different users. For security reasons, once a user is revoked from the
   group, the blocks, which were previously signed by this revoked user
   must be re-signed by an existing user. The straightforward method, which
   allows an existing user to download the corresponding part of shared
   data and re-sign it during user revocation, is inefficient due to the
   large size of shared data in the cloud. In this paper, we propose a
   novel public auditing mechanism for the integrity of shared data with
   efficient user revocation in mind. By utilizing proxy re-signatures, we
   allow the cloud to re-sign blocks on behalf of existing users during
   user revocation, so that existing users do not need to download and
   re-sign blocks by themselves. In addition, a public verifier is always
   able to audit the integrity of shared data without retrieving the entire
   data from the cloud, even if some part of shared data has been re-signed
   by the cloud. Experimental results show that our mechanism can
   significantly improve the efficiency of user revocation.}},

   propose a Welfare-Maximizing Regulation Allocation (WMRA) algorithm for
   the aggregator to fairly allocate the regulation amount among the EVs.
   The algorithm operates in real time and does not require any prior
   knowledge on the statistical information of the system. Compared with
   previous works, WMRA accommodates a wide spectrum of vital system
   characteristics, including limited EV battery size, EV self
   charging/discharging, EV battery degradation cost, and the cost of using
   external energy sources. Furthermore, our simulation results indicate

Abstract = {{MyWalk is a mobile app to enable gait rehabilitation in the community.
   Particularly, it can be used to treat and assess step-time asymmetry
   (STA) - which occurs when the amount of time between consecutive heel
   strikes is uneven. Temporal gait asymmetry, of which STA is a form, is
   common post-stroke and could result in difficulties such as joint
   degeneration or musculoskeletal pain. By enabling STA rehabilitation on
   a smartphone, post-stroke patients can now improve and assess their STA
   within the context of their everyday environments. Initial validation of
   MyWalk's algorithm showed minimal error (RMSE 2.20-2.67\%) versus a
   foot-switch ground truth in detecting STA for symmetric walking
   conditions, but larger error (RMSE 13.82-16.34\%) in asymmetric walking
   conditions. Future work will be to improve the accuracy of MyWalk's STA
   algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents an active mechanical perforation method developed
   for embryo biopsy in the preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD)

   micro-needle is driven longitudinally with sinusoidal or square wave
   signals at frequencies close to the micro-needle bending resonances in
   order to excite its lateral vibration modes due to nonlinear modal
   coupling. It has been demonstrated that, in particular, the lateral
   cutting method, is effective and suitable for embryo perforation as well
   as microinjection and micro-dissection. A micro-needle driven with a
   square wave signal at frequency (similar to 850Hz) close to the
   micro-needle first bending resonance frequency has been shown to
   generate an accurate cutting dimensions with minimum damage to the mouse
   embryo zona pellucida. A success rate of 88\% was achieved based on

Abstract = {{We consider the impact of compiler optimizations on the quality of
   high-level synthesis (HLS)-generated FPGA hardware. Using a HLS tool
   implemented within the state-of-the-art LLVM {[}1] compiler, we study
   the effect of compiler optimizations on the hardware metrics of circuit
   area, execution cycles, Fmax, and wall-clock time. We evaluate 56
   different compiler optimizations implemented within LLVM and show that
   some optimizations significantly affect hardware quality. Moreover, we
   show that hardware quality is also affected by the order in which
   optimizations are applied. We then present a new HLS-directed approach
   to compiler optimizations, wherein we execute partial HLS and profiling
   at intermittent points in the optimization process and use the results
   to judiciously undo the impact of optimization passes predicted to be
   damaging to the generated hardware quality. Results show that our
   approach produces circuits with 16\% better speed performance, on
   average, versus using the standard -O3 optimization level.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Abstract = {{Pancreatic islets are heavily vascularized in vivo with fenestrated
   endothelial cells (ECs) to facilitate blood glucose-sensing and
   endocrine hormone secretion. The close proximity of insulin secreting
   beta cells and ECs also plays a critical role in modulating the
   proliferation and survival of both cell types with the mechanisms
   governing this interaction poorly understood. Isolated islets lose EC
   morphology and mass over a period of days in culture prohibiting study
   of this interaction in vitro. The loss of ECs also limits the efficacy
   of islet transplant revascularization in the treatment of Type 1
   diabetes. We previously showed that microfluidically driven flow
   positively affects beta-cell function and EC survival in culture due to
   enhanced transport of media into the tissue. However, holding islets
   stationary in media flow using a dam-wall design also resulted in
   reduced glucose-stimulated metabolic and Ca2+ responses at the periphery
   of the tissue consistent with shear-induced damage. We have now created
   a device that traps islets into sequential cup-shaped nozzles. This
   hydrodynamic trap design limits flow velocity around the perimeter of
   the islet while enhancing media flow through the tissue. We demonstrate
   the feasibility of this device to dynamically treat and collect effluent
   from islets. We further show that treating islets in this device
   enhances EC morphology without reducing glucose-stimulate Ca2+
   responses. These data reveal a microfluidic device to study EC and
   endocrine cell interaction that can be further leveraged to prime islets
   prior to transplantation.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{22}},
Pages = {{4409-4418}},
Abstract = {{In order to be more extensively used outside of research laboratories,
   lab-on-chip technologies must be mass-produced using low-cost materials
   such as thermoplastics. Thermoplastics, however, are generally
   hydrophobic in their native state, which makes them unsuitable for
   direct use with biological samples in aqueous solution, and thus require
   surface coating. This coating should be robust, inexpensive and simple
   to implement, in order not to hinder the industrial advantage of
   thermoplastic chips. Cyclic Olefin Copolymer (COC) is a particularly
   appealing polymer, but it is also difficult to functionalize due to its
   chemical inertness. Here we introduce and compare the performance of two
   new approaches for COC coating. One relies on the use of a commercial
   triblock copolymer, Pluronic (R) F127. The second approach uses new
   copolymers synthesized by radical polymerization, and consisting of a
   dimethylacrylamide (DMA) backbone carrying aliphatic side chains (C22).
   Two DMA-C22 copolymers were synthesized with various C22/DMA ratios:
   DMA-S at 0.175\% and DMA-M at 0.35\%. Different physicochemical
   properties of the polymers such as critical micellar concentration
   (CMC), water contact angle, electroosmosis were investigated. Coated COC
   chips were then tested for their ability to reduce the adsorption of
   proteins, microparticles, and for protein electrophoresis. For each
   application we found an optimal treatment protocol to considerably
   improve the performance of the thermoplastic chip. These treatments use
   physisorption in situ which requires no photografting or chemical
   reaction and can be performed by a simple incubation either after chip
   production, or just prior to use.}},

   entrance}},

Abstract = {{The entrance of a microgel from a large channel into a narrow tube via a
   tapered entrance is described. The microgel was moved under a constant
   pressure difference, unlike previous works, which were implemented under
   constant flow rate conditions. The detailed relationship between the
   steady-state position of the microgel, the volume loss of the microgel
   and the applied pressure difference, Delta P, was established. Beyond a
   critical value, Delta P-crit, a steady state was not possible, and the
   microgel completely entered and traversed the constriction. Delta P-crit
   increased monotonically and non-linearly with microgel size. The
   variation of the microgel position and volume with Delta P were found to
   agree well with theoretical predictions. Also investigated was the
   relaxation of the microgel to its initial shape and volume upon exiting
   the constriction. It was discovered that the microgel relaxed to a
   spherical shape first, and swelled up to its initial volume later. It
   was also found that when adequate time was not provided for relaxation,
   the microgel could be forced into the constriction at a lower Delta
   P-crit. These fundamental results are expected to be useful in
   understanding the occlusion of blood vessels by soft particles, and in
   the design of hydrogels with specific relaxation properties.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud service pricing plays a pivotal role towards the success of cloud
   computing. Existing pricing schemes, however, either provide no service
   guarantees (e. g., Spot Instances in Amazon EC2), or use static
   on-demand pricing in which the price cannot respond quickly to market
   dynamics (e. g., On-demand Instances in Amazon EC2). To overcome these
   problems, in this paper we design dynamic auctions where computing
   instances are periodically auctioned off to accommodate user demands
   over time. We address the two main challenges of revenue maximization
   and auction truthfulness. Our design encompasses a capacity allocation
   scheme, which determines the amount of instances to be auctioned off in
   each period, as well as the underlying auction mechanisms, based on
   dynamic payment schemes corresponding to the proposed capacity
   allocations over time. We show that our design is two-dimensionally
   truthful, and it is asymptotically optimal when demand is sufficiently
   high. Furthermore, by identifying certain optimization structures, we
   substantially reduce the computational complexity of our solution.
   Extensive simulations show that our design closely tracks market
   changes, while generating higher revenues than on-demand pricing.}},

Abstract = {{Middleboxes have found widespread adoption in today's networks. They
   perform a variety of network functions such as WAN optimization,
   intrusion detection, and network-level firewalls. Processing packets to
   serve these functions often require multiple middlebox resources, e. g.,
   CPU and link bandwidth. Furthermore, different packet traffic flows may
   consume significantly different amounts of various resources, depending
   on the network functions that are applied. Multi-resource fair queueing
   is therefore needed to allow flows to share multiple middlebox resources
   in a fair manner. In this paper, we clarify the fairness requirements of
   a queueing scheme and present Dominant Resource Generalized Processor
   Sharing (DRGPS), a fluid flow-based fair queueing idealization that
   strictly realizes Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) at all times. As a
   form of Generalized Processor Sharing (GPS) running on multiple
   resources, DRGPS serves as a benchmark that practical packet-by-packet
   fair queueing algorithm should follow. With DRGPS, techniques and
   insights that have been developed for traditional fair queueing can be
   leveraged to schedule multiple resources. As a case study, we extend
   Worst-case Fair Weighted Fair Queueing (WF(2)Q) to the multi-resource
   setting and analyze its performance.}},

Abstract = {{Biobased/green polymers and nanotechnology warrant a multidisciplinary
   approach to promote the development of the next generation of materials,
   products, and processes that are environmentally sustainable. The
   scientific challenge is to find the suitable applications, and thereby
   to create the demand for large scale production of biobased/green
   polymers that would foster sustainable development of these eco-friendly
   materials in contrast to their petroleum/fossil fuel derived
   counterparts. In this context, this research aims to investigate the
   synergistic effect of green materials and nanotechnology to develop a
   new family of multifunctional biobased polymer composites with promoted
   thermal conductivity. For instance, such composite can be used as a heat
   management material in the electronics industry. A series of parametric
   studies were conducted to elucidate the science behind materials
   behavior and their structure-to-property relationships. Using biobased
   polymers (e. g., polylactic acid (PLA)) as the matrix, heat transfer
   networks were developed and structured by embedding hexagonal boron
   nitride (hBN) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNP) in the PLA matrix. The
   use of hybrid filler system, with optimized material formulation, was
   found to promote the composite's effective thermal conductivity by
   10-folded over neat PLA. This was achieved by promoting the development
   of an interconnected thermally conductive network through structuring
   hybrid fillers. The thermally conductive composite is expected to afford
   unique opportunities to injection mold three-dimensional, net-shape,
   lightweight, and eco-friendly microelectronic enclosures with superior
   heat dissipation performance.}},

Abstract = {{We were interested in evaluating the ability of the mesenchymal stromal
   cell (MSC) population, human umbilical cord perivascular cells
   (HUCPVCs), to undergo cardiomyocyte reprogramming in an established
   coculture system with rat embryonic cardiomyocytes. Results were
   compared with human bone marrow-derived (BM) MSCs. The transcription
   factors GATA4 and Mef2c were expressed in HUCPVCs but not BM-MSCs at
   baseline and, at 7 days, increased 7.6- and 3.5-fold, respectively,
   compared with BM-MSCs. Although cardiac-specific gene expression
   increased in both cell types in coculture, upregulation was more
   significant in HUCPVCs, consistent with Mef2c-GATA4 synergism. Using a
   lentivector with eGFP transcribed from the alpha-myosin heavy chain
   (alpha-MHC) promoter, we found that cardiac gene expression was greater
   in HUCPVCs than BM-MSCs after 14 days coculture (52 +/- 17\% vs. 29 +/-
   6\%, respectively). A higher frequency of HUCPVCs expressed alpha-MHC
   protein compared with BM-MSCs (11.6 +/- 0.9\% vs. 5.3 +/- 0.3\%);
   however, both cell types retained MSC-associated determinants. We also
   assessed the ability of the MSC types to mediate cardiac regeneration in
   a NOD/SC1D gamma mouse model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).
   Fourteen days after AMI, cardiac function was significantly better in
   cell-treated mice compared with control animals and HUCPVCs exhibited
   greater improvement. Although human cells persisted in the infarct area,
   the frequency of alpha-MHC expression was low. Our results indicate that
   HUCPVCs exhibit a greater degree of cardiomyocyte reprogramming but that
   differentiation for both cell types is partial. We conclude that HUCPVCs
   may be preferable to BM-MSCs in the cell therapy of AMI.}},

   hydroxy-BsubPc (HO-BsubPc) as well as para-, meta-, and
   ortho-hydroxy-phenoxy-BsubPc (p-, m- and o-HOPhO-BsubPc). Each solid
   state arrangement demonstrated both strong (O-H center dot center dot
   center dot N, O-H center dot center dot center dot O) and weak (C-H
   center dot center dot center dot O, C-H center dot center dot center dot
   N) hydrogen bonds, with the structure for o-HOPhO-BsubPc including
   examples of bifurcated hydrogen bonds. Many of the C-H center dot center
   dot center dot O interactions were found to occur alongside notable
   perturbations to the expected intra- and intermolecular geometry of
   BsubPcs, providing structural evidence for the significance of weak C-H
   center dot center dot center dot O bonds. We observed that the imine
   nitrogen atom of the BsubPc moiety is a reliable hydrogen bond acceptor,
   and in most arrangements, the hydroxy moiety participated in hydrogen
   bonds both as a donor and an acceptor. The presence of hydrogen bonds in
   addition to other intermolecular interactions (pi-pi and CH center dot
   center dot center dot pi, which are common in BsubPc solid state
   arrangements) facilitates the arrangement of BsubPc into two- and
   three-dimensional networks of closely associated molecules.}},

Abstract = {{The loss of cognition associated with dementia affects an individual's
   ability to participate in even the most fundamental activities of daily
   living (ADL). Assistive technology for cognition (ATC) has shown
   potential to support ADL completion, but few devices have undergone
   real-world deployments.
   The COACH is an existing ATC that has been shown in supervised trials to
   support older adults with dementia through the ADL of hand washing. This
   paper presents the results of a study of the COACH in a long-term,
   real-world, community-based deployment. The COACH was installed in a
   washroom at the Toronto Memory Program. The COACH was configured to run
   in an unsupervised state, interacting with users when they were not
   progressing through the task. Video was collected from an overhead
   camera, and was manually annotated to determine the system's
   capabilities. The trials were conducted from February to May, 2012.
   Twenty participants contributed forty-one hand washing trials. Results
   suggest that the COACH was able to identify completed task steps with
   46.6\% accuracy and the participants' true performance with 54.9\%
   accuracy. This study clarifies the need for more robust, accurate and
   generalized user tracking, including the use of three-dimensional
   tracking, gesture, grip and rotation detection.}},

Abstract = {{This study examines the application of backscattered ultrasound (US) and
   photoacoustics (PA) for assessment of bone structure and density
   variations. Both methods are applied in the frequency-domain, employing
   linear frequency modulation chirps. An 800-nm CW laser and a 3.5-MHz
   ultrasonic transducer are used for transmitting the signal. The
   backscattered pressure waves are detected with a 2.2-MHz US transducer.
   Experiments are focused on detection and evaluation of PA and US signals
   from in-vitro animal and human bones with cortical and trabecular
   sublayers. Osteoporotic changes in the bone are simulated by using a
   very mild demineralization solution (EDTA). Changes in the time-domain
   signal as well as integrated backscattering spectra are compared for
   each sample before and after demineralization. Results show the ability
   of US to generate detectable signals from deeper bone sublayers, whereas
   the PA signals show higher sensitivity to the variation in bone density.
   While US signal variation with changes in the cortical layer is
   insignificant, PA has proven to be able to detect minor variation of the
   cortical bone density.}},

Abstract = {{Blood flow velocity and volumetric flow measurements are important
   parameters for assessment of the severity of stenosis and the outcome of
   interventional therapy. However, feasibility of intravascular flow
   measurement using a rotational catheter based phase resolved Doppler
   optical coherence tomography (DOCT) is difficult. Motion artefacts
   induced by the rotating optical imaging catheter, and the radially
   dependent noise background of measured Doppler signals are the main
   challenges encountered. In this study, a custom-made data acquisition
   system and developed algorithms to remove non-uniform rotational
   distortion (NURD) induced phase shift artefact by tracking the phase
   shift observed on catheter sheath. The flow velocity is calculated from
   Doppler shift obtained by Kasai autocorrelation after motion artefact
   removal. Blood flow velocity profiles in porcine carotid arteries in
   vivo were obtained at 100 frames/s with 500 A-lines/frame and DOCT
   images were taken at 20 frames/s with 2500 A-lines/frame. Time-varying
   velocity profiles were obtained at an artery branch. Furthermore, the
   identification of a vein adjacent to the catheterized vessel based on
   the color Doppler signal was also observed. The absolute measurement of
   intravascular flow using a rotating fiber catheter can provide insights
   to different stages of interventional treatment of stenosis in carotid
   artery.}},

Abstract = {{Virtualization has become a magic bullet to increase utilization,
   improve security, lower costs, and reduce management overheads. In many
   scenarios, the number of virtual machines consolidated onto a single
   processor has grown even faster than the number of hardware threads.
   This results in multiprogrammed virtualization where many virtual
   machines time-share a single processor core. Such fine-grain sharing
   comes at a cost; each time a virtual machine gets scheduled by the
   hypervisor, it effectively begins with a ``cold{''} cache, since any
   cache blocks it accessed in the past have likely been evicted by other
   virtual machines.
   Recently, cache restoration prefetchers have been shown to reduce the
   cold cache effects caused by multiprogrammed virtualization. However,
   these prefetchers waste large amounts of bandwidth prefetching many
   useless blocks and writing and reading metadata to and from memory.
   Using block reuse based filtering, we enhance two existing cache
   restoration prefetchers and reduce their bandwidth overheads by 16\% and
   32\%, with slowdowns of only 0.5\% and 0.6\%.
   We also propose a Region-Based Cache Restoration Prefetcher (RECAP),
   which groups cache blocks into coarse-grain regions of memory, and
   predicts which regions contain useful blocks to prefetch the next time
   the current virtual machine executes. Based on these predictions, and
   using a simple compression technique that exploits spatial locality,
   RECAP provides a robust prefetcher that improves performance by up to
   42\% for some applications and only uses 14\% more bandwidth and 3.5\%
   more power than a stride prefetcher, on average. Compared to other
   prefetchers designed for multiprogrammed virtualization, RECAP provides
   comparable performance while using an average of 12\% to 27\% less
   bandwidth, and reducing the energy-delay product of the L2 cache and
   main memory by 12\% to 13\% on average.}},

Abstract = {{In high power applications, switching devices such as MOSFETs and IGBTs
   must often be connected in parallel in order to provide higher current
   capability. However, the current imbalance of parallel connected IGBTs
   due to stray inductance, variations in device characteristics and
   asymmetric PCB layout, necessitates de-rating of the IGBTs. This
   deliberate de-rating is required in order to ensure the IGBTs function
   within their Safe-Operating-Area. Unfortunately, de-rating also leads to
   an increase in cost, size and complexity of the overall power
   electronics system. A current balancing method for parallel connected
   IGBTs using a dynamically adjustable gate driving resistance
   (R-g\_dyanmic) is presented in this paper. Experimental results are
   achieved by measuring the current distribution between two parallel
   connected IGBTs (rated at 600V, 90A). These experimental results
   indicate an improvement in average current imbalance of 74\% and 65\%
   for the turn on and off periods, respectively.}},

   provides high-efficiency programmable ambient lighting and can also act
   as a networked sensor node to gather a variety of local measurements,
   which leads to improved safety, comfort and efficiency in future
   lighting systems. A dimmable LED driver based on the LLC resonant dc-dc
   converter topology is proposed to implement an emerging communication
   scheme, Visible Light Communication (VLC). VLC capitalizes on the high
   switching-speed of LEDs and offers several compelling advantages over
   conventional RF and wired communication schemes. The digitally
   controlled LLC converter operates in constant-current burst mode, where
   the burst is sequenced to independently control the dimming and
   transmission the data using the Variable Pulse Position Modulation
   (VPPM) protocol. A receiver circuit is designed to demodulate and decode

Abstract = {{Plasmonic slot waveguide (PSW) provides unique ability to confine the
   light in few nanometers only. It also allows for near perfect
   transmission through sharp bends. These features motivate utilizing the
   PSW in various on chip applications that require nanoscale manipulation
   of light. The main challenge of using these PSWs are the associated high
   losses that allow for propagation length of similar to 10 mu m only.
   However, this constraint plays a minimal rule for circuits designed to
   have footprint in the order of few micrometers only. Thus, designing PSW
   with compact size and superior performance is of prime essential.
   Finite difference time domain (FDTD) is usually utilized for modeling of
   such networks. This technique is, however, inefficient as it requires
   very fine grid and carful manipulation of the boundary condition to
   avoid spurious reflections. In the paper, we present our recent
   equivalent circuit model that is capable of accurately modeling the
   various junctions including T and X shapes. This model is highly
   efficient and allows for obtaining a closed form expression of the
   response of any network of PSW with accuracy comparable to the FDTD

Abstract = {{A new adaptive beamforming method for accurately focusing ultrasound
   behind highly scattering layers of human skull and its application to 3D
   transcranial imaging via small-aperture planar phased arrays are
   reported. Due to its undulating, inhomogeneous, porous, and highly
   attenuative structure, human skull bone severely distorts ultrasonic
   beams produced by conventional focusing methods in both imaging and
   therapeutic applications. Strong acoustical mismatch between the skull
   and brain tissues, in addition to the skull's undulating topology across
   the active area of a planar ultrasonic probe, could cause multiple
   reflections and unpredictable refraction during beamforming and imaging
   processes. Such effects could significantly deflect the probe's beam
   from the intended focal point. Presented here is a theoretical basis and
   simulation results of an adaptive beamforming method that compensates
   for the latter effects in transmission mode, accompanied by experimental
   verification.
   The probe is a custom-designed 2 MHz, 256-element matrix array with 0.45
   mm element size and 0.1mm kerf. Through its small footprint, it is
   possible to accurately measure the profile of the skull segment in
   contact with the probe and feed the results into our ray tracing
   program. The latter calculates the new time delay patterns adapted to
   the geometrical and acoustical properties of the skull phantom segment
   in contact with the probe. The time delay patterns correct for the
   refraction at the skull-brain boundary and bring the distorted beam back
   to its intended focus. The algorithms were implemented on the ultrasound
   open-platform ULA-OP (developed at the University of Florence).}},

Abstract = {{Interest in noise control has been growing in recent years and efforts
   are under way to improve the acoustic performance of existing sound
   absorbers and also to replace the non-recyclable ones with
   environmentally friendly materials. Present study describes the research
   on fabrication, improvement of acoustic absorption and enhancement of
   mechanical strength of bio-based open-cell foams. Through this study,
   highly porous open-cell Polylactide (PLA) foams were fabricated by a new
   fabrication method combining particulate leaching technique and
   compression molding.
   Foamed structures were fabricated with PLA and Polyethylene glycol (PEG)
   with salt as the particulate. Pore size of the foam was controlled by
   salt particulates and higher interconnectivity was achieved by the
   co-continuous blending morphology of PLA matrix with water-soluble PEG.
   As a result of novel secondary porous structure, acoustic performance of
   PLA foams was successfully improved.
   One issue with application of bio-based open-cell foams is the weak
   structure. To improve mechanical characteristics of PLA foams, different
   polymer composites of PLA and Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) were foamed and
   characterized in terms of acoustic performance, mechanical properties
   and foam morphology.
   Polymers used in this study are bio-based which is of great importance
   considering huge amount of foams used as acoustic absorbers in various
   industries.}},

Abstract = {{We present a lab-on-a-chip approach to informing thermal oil recovery
   processes. Bitumen - a major global resource - is an extremely viscous
   oil which is extracted by injecting steam underground in a process known
   as Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage (SAGD). Here, a microfluidic network
   saturated with bitumen provides a physical model of the SAGD reservoir;
   steam is injected into the chip, and the oil recovery dynamics are
   visualized and quantified in real-time. The unique advantage of this
   approach is the pore-scale quantification of fluid phase dynamics under
   relevant reservoir conditions and pore sizes. High resolution is
   achieved by leveraging the inherent fluorescence of the native bitumen.
   The approach is applied to quantify the efficacy of an alkaline steam
   additive. With the additive, the mean characteristic size of
   oil-in-water emulsions formed during SAGD is reduced from 150 mu m to 6
   mu m, and the corresponding recovery effectiveness is improved by
   similar to 50\%. These results demonstrate that pore-scale process
   quantification enabled by lab-on-a-chip methods can improve the
   efficacy, and the associated carbon footprint, of energy intensive
   thermal oil recovery processes.}},

Abstract = {{The employment of contrast agents in photoacoustic imaging has gained
   significant attention within the past few years their biomedical
   applications. In this study, the use of silica-coated superparamagnetic
   iron oxide (Fe3O4) nanoparticles (SPION) was investigated as a contrast
   agent in biomedical photoacoustic imaging. SPIONs have been widely used
   as Food-and-Drug-Administration (FDA)-approved contrast agents for
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and are known to have an excellent
   safety profile. Using our frequency-domain photoacoustic correlation
   technique ({''}the photoacoustic radar{''}) with modulated laser
   excitation, we examined the effects of nanoparticle size, concentration
   and biological medium (e.g. serum, sheep blood) on its photoacoustic
   response in turbid media (intralipid solution). Maximum detection depth
   and minimum measurable SPION concentration were determined
   experimentally. The detection was performed using a single element
   transducer. The nanoparticle-induced optical contrast ex vivo in dense
   muscular tissues (avian pectus) was evaluated using a phased array
   photoacoustic probe and the strong potential of silica-coated SPION as a
   possible photoacoustic contrast agent was demonstrated. This study opens
   the way for future clinical applications of nanoparticle-enhanced
   photoacoustic imaging in cancer therapy.}},

Abstract = {{Discriminant analysis methods are powerful tools for face recognition.
   However, these methods cannot be used for the single sample per person
   scenario because the within-subject variability cannot be estimated in
   this case. In the generic learning solution, this variability is
   estimated using images of a generic training set, for which more than
   one sample per person is available. However, because of rather poor
   estimation of the within-subject variability using a generic set, the
   performance of discriminant analysis methods is yet to be satisfactory.
   This problem particularly exists when images are under drastic facial
   expression variation. In this paper, we show that images with the same
   expression are located on a common subspace, which here we call it the
   expression subspace. We show that by projecting an image with an
   arbitrary expression into the expression subspaces, we can synthesize
   new expression images. By means of the synthesized images for subjects
   with one image sample, we can obtain more accurate estimation of the
   within-subject variability and achieve significant improvement in
   recognition. We performed comprehensive experiments on two large face
   databases: the Face Recognition Grand Challenge and the Cohn-Kanade
   AU-Coded Facial Expression database to support the proposed methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Advances in the miniaturization of semiconductor devices have been made
   possible by new methods of microfabrication techniques. These advances
   have stimulated the birth of Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS)
   technology which enable the fabrication of a wide variety of sensing and
   actuating devices of microscopic dimensions. Of particular interest are
   thermal microactuators which provide large deflections and are
   compatible with existing IC technologies. In MEMS technology, a well
   controlled etching process is critical for the fabrication of structures
   with specific geometry and properties. Increasing demand for intricate
   semiconductor devices has fueled and motivated researches to develop
   high precision micromachining techniques. Inductively coupled
   plasma-Reactive ion etching (ICP-RIE) is capable of producing features
   with high aspect ratio as high as 90:1. Taking advantage of the notching
   effect when making a structure from silicon on insulator (SOI),
   structure release without the use of HF acid has been demonstrated. We
   report on the development of a self-aligned single-mask process for the
   fabrication of released and movable MEMS devices. ICP-RIE was used to
   realize the structures directly out of single crystal silicon. Applying
   side wall passivation, controlling the ratio of ion flux and radical
   flux, smooth etching profile can be obtained with high aspect ratio. No
   wet etching process is required to release the structures as is the case
   with SOI wafers. This approach overcomes the stiction limitation
   associated with wet etching and yields good thickness uniformity over
   the entire structure. Electrothermal microactuators with integrated
   microgrippers were designed, fabricated and characterized. harvesters.}},

Abstract = {{This work presents mathematical modelling of unimorph and bimorph AlN
   piezoelectric micromachined harvesters utilizing an energetic electron
   source - amenable to powering miniaturized devices such as MEMS(micro
   electro mechanical system) sensors. Tritiated silicon, as the energetic
   electron source, is appropriately aligned under a cantilever structure
   such that the emitted electrons are trapped by the collecting surface of
   the cantilever, thereby rendering it negatively charged while the
   electron emitting surface becomes positively charged. As a result, the
   attractive electric force causes the cantilever to bend towards the
   electron emitting surface until it makes contact and is discharged, and
   thus the cantilever snaps back. The resulting energy from the
   piezoelectric capacitor is rectified to provide electrical power to MEMS
   devices. Detailed electromechanical analysis and modelling of unimorph
   and series and parallel bimorph architectures are presented. Very good
   agreement between the results of the analytical model and the available
   experimental findings is demonstrated, thus providing assurance for the
   optimization study of tritiated silicon radioisotope excited
   piezoelectric energy harvesters.}},

Abstract = {{The transition to increasingly sophisticated microfluidic systems has
   led to the emergence of ``organ-on-chip'' technology that can faithfully
   recapitulate organ-level function. Given the rapid progress at the
   interface between microfluidics and cell biology, there is need to
   provide a focused evaluation of the state-of-the-art in microfluidic
   systems for cancer research to advance development, accelerate discovery
   of novel insights, and facilitate cooperation between engineers,
   biologists and oncologists in the clinic. Here, we provide a focused
   review of microfluidics technology from cells- and tissues- to
   organs-on-chips with application toward studying the tumor
   microenvironment. Key aspects of the tumor microenvironment including
   angiogenesis, hypoxia, biochemical gradients, tumor-stromal
   interactions, and the extracellular matrix are summarized for both solid
   tumors and non-solid hematologic malignancies. An overview of
   microfluidic systems designed specifically to answer questions related
   to different aspects of the tumor microenvironment is provided, followed
   by an examination of how these systems offer new opportunities to study
   outstanding challenges related to the major cancer hallmarks. Challenges
   also remain for microfluidics engineers, but it is hoped that
   cooperation between engineers and biologists at the intersection of
   their respective fields will lead to significant impact on the utility
   of organs-on-chips in cancer research.}},

Abstract = {{Biological analogies can increase creativity in design by providing
   related, yet distant-domain stimuli, which have been reported to lead to
   more innovative concepts than within-domain stimuli. However, over the
   past decade, we have observed that designers are influenced by cognitive
   biases in their selection and application of biological analogies. We
   propose that abstraction of biological nouns in descriptions of
   biological phenomena can reduce such cognitive bias and support
   analogical reasoning. Experiments confirmed the promising effect of this
   objective and automatable intervention on novice designers. The
   cognitive biases and fixation we aim to reduce are relevant to

Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{8}},

Abstract = {{The potential benefits of using new technologies such as microfluidics
   for life science applications are exciting, but it is critical to
   understand and document potential biases imposed by these technologies
   on the observed results. Here, we report the first study of genome-level
   effects on cells manipulated by digital microfluidics. These effects
   were evaluated using a broad suite of tools: cell-based stress sensors
   for heat shock activation, single-cell COMET assays to probe changes in
   DNA integrity, and DNA microarrays and qPCR to evaluate changes in
   genetic expression. The results lead to two key observations. First,
   most DMF operating conditions tested, including those that are commonly
   used in the literature, result in negligible cell-stress or genome-level
   effects. Second, for DMF devices operated at high driving frequency (18
   kHz) and with large driving electrodes (10 mm x 10 mm), there are
   significant damage to DNA integrity and differential genomic regulation.
   We hypothesize that these effects are caused by droplet heating. We
   recommend that for DMF applications involving mammalian cells that
   driving frequencies be kept low (<= 10 kHz) and electrode sizes be kept
   small (<= 5 mm) to avoid detrimental effects.}},

Abstract = {{Although information pertaining to the viscous characterization of HES
   130/0.4 Voluven (R) and HES 260/0.45 Pentaspan (R) is available,
   quantification is limited to 100\% concentrations. We focus here on the
   quantification of their viscous behavior along with HES 130/0.4 Volulyte
   (R) in a shear thinning non-Newtonian blood analog of aqueous xanthan
   gum and glycerol. Dynamic viscosities of multiple batches of HES fluids
   were measured through capillary viscometry. The viscous behavior of
   100\%, 25\% and 12.5\% concentrations were then measured through a
   closed flow loop across physiologically relevant flow rates. Measured
   viscosities were 2.57 millipascal second (mPa.s) 6.52 mPa.s and 2.48
   mPa.s for HES 130/0.4 Voluven (R), HES 260/0.45 and HES 130/0.4 Volulyte
   (R), respectively. Pipe flow analysis found that all HES fluids
   displayed Newtonian behavior at 100\% concentrations. 25\%
   concentrations of both HES 130/0.4 fluids decreased analog viscosity
   23\%-29\% at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/s and 16\%-21\% at a flow rate of
   22.5 ml/s. At a flow rate of 22.5 ml/s, 25\% and 12.5\% concentrations
   of HES 260/0.45 resulted in analog viscosity changes of 3.9\%-4.5\%.
   Capillary viscosity reductions of approximately 7\% and 14.5\% in HES
   130/0.4 Voluven (R) and HES 260/0.45 suggest changes in molecular
   composition to batches previously measured. Maintenance of analog
   viscosity suggests that HES 260/0.45 would be suitable as a high
   viscosity plasma expander in extreme hemodilution through preservation
   of microcirculatory function and wall shear stress (WSS).}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a microfluidic system and a technique for
   electrically measuring the deformability of red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs
   are deformed when they flow through a small capillary (microfluidic
   channel). The microfluidic device consists of two stages of
   microchannels as two measurement units for measuring cell size/volume
   and cell deformability. A low frequency voltage signal is established
   across the microfluidic channel, and electrical current signal is
   sampled continuously when RBCs pass through the measurement areas.
   Mechanical opacity is defined to mitigate the coupled effect of cell
   size/volume and deformability. The system performed tests on controlled,
   glutaraldehyde-treated, and heated RBCs using a number of driving
   pressures. The experimental results proved the capability of the system
   for distinguishing different RBC populations based on their
   deformability with a throughput of similar to 10 cells s(-1).}},

Abstract = {{Phased array inspection was conducted on a V-butt welded steel sample

   nominal central frequencies (2.25, 4, 5 and 10 MHz). This paper
   describes the measured results, which show high accuracy, typically in
   the range of 0.1-0.2 mm. The results concluded that:
   1. There was no statistical difference between the calculated flaw
   depths from phased array inspections at different flaw tip angles.
   2. There was no statistical difference in flaw depths calculated using
   phased array data collected from either side of the weld.
   3. Flaws with depths less than the estimated probe signal shear
   wavelength could not be sized.
   4. Finally, there was no statistical difference in the calculated flaw
   depths using phased array probes with different sampling frequencies and

Title = {{Secondary convection due to second normal stress differences: A new
   mechanism for the mass transport of solutes in pressure-driven flows of
   concentrated, non-colloidal suspensions}},
Journal = {{SOFT MATTER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{A mechanism for enhancement in the mass transfer rates of solutes in
   flowing, concentrated suspensions that is often cited in the literature
   is the self-diffusion of particles arising from shear-induced
   interparticle interactions. Recently, it was demonstrated by Zrehen and
   Ramachandran (Phys. Rev. Lett., 2013, 110, 018306) that the
   pressure-driven flow of suspensions through non-axisymmetric geometries
   is not unidirectional; the main flow is accompanied by secondary
   currents within the cross-section of the conduit, driven by second
   normal stress differences. This secondary convection represents a new
   and heretofore unexplored, advective mechanism for the mass transfer of
   solutes normal to the primary streamlines in flowing suspensions, and is
   investigated in this paper via simulations. For small particle sizes,
   the enhancement of solute diffusivity by shear-induced self-diffusion is
   weak. However, the magnitude of the secondary currents is unaffected by
   particle size. Thus, for suspensions with particles much smaller than
   the conduit size, secondary convection, and not shear-induced
   self-diffusion, can be the dominant mechanism for shear-induced
   enhancement of mass transfer. In the limit where shear-induced
   self-diffusion is the dominant diffusive mode of mass transfer,
   secondary convection can, for some geometries and conditions, double the
   augmentation of mass transfer over that expected from self-diffusion
   alone. The relevance of this new mechanism of mass transfer is in the
   improved modeling of the transport of solutes for which the dominant
   mass transfer resistance is in the suspension phase. This mechanism also
   suggests the possibility of exploiting conduit geometry to improve the
   mass transfer rate of solutes.}},

Abstract = {{Activated sludge flocs that are carried to the final effluent can

   investigated. The conditions compared were nitrifying vs. non-nitrifying
   vs. an enhanced biological nutrient removal-University of Cape Town
   (BNR-UCT) system. The results showed that the flocs generated in the
   BNR-UCT process were easier to disinfect. The final effluent from the
   BNR-UCT process also showed improved kinetics of inactivation and
   reached higher levels of disinfection. The nitrifying system's final
   effluent had a lower number of initial fecal coliforms, which
   contributed to reaching higher disinfection levels compared to the

Journal = {{WATER QUALITY RESEARCH JOURNAL OF CANADA}},

Pages = {{203-222}},
Abstract = {{Permeable pavement (PP) systems provide opportunities to mitigate the
   impacts of urbanization on receiving water systems by providing at
   source treatment and management of stormwater. However, they do not
   receive mainstream use throughout much of Canada and the USA because of
   a lack of local guidance documents, demonstration projects and
   performance data. Studies have repeatedly shown that PPs attenuate
   stormwater flows by reducing volume and frequency of stormwater flows,
   reducing and delaying peak flow rates, and increasing flow durations. PP
   systems have been shown to improve stormwater quality by reducing
   stormwater temperature, pollutant concentrations and pollutant loadings
   of suspended solids, heavy metals, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, and some
   nutrients. This review is intended as a comprehensive summary of the
   current state of knowledge of the environmental performance of PP
   systems. Published research is synthesized to examine the hydrologic
   performance, impacts to water quality, longevity and functionality and
   maintenance needs of PP systems. Where appropriate, the limitations of
   current knowledge are discussed and emerging and future research needs
   are presented. The intent of this review is to provide stakeholders in
   stormwater management with the critical information that is needed to
   foster acceptance of PPs as a viable alternative to traditional systems.}},

Abstract = {{Fabrication of low cost solar cells using ultra-thin (approximately 20
   mu m) silicon wafers is a viable route given the significant potential
   of reduced material cost and its versatility to a range of portable and
   terrestrial applications. Low temperature processing is a compelling
   opportunity for the synthesis of high-efficiency ultra-thin silicon
   wafers. Further, excellent surface passivation attainable through facile
   low temperature processing techniques is an essential enabler for
   effective manufacturing of ultra-thin silicon solar cells, and thus
   paving the way for high-efficiency low-cost silicon foil photovoltaics.
   This article presents a novel low temperature passivation scheme using
   approximately 1 nm thick facile native oxide and 75 nm PECVD SiNx. A
   maximum lifetime of 1.7 ms has been obtained for the passivation scheme.
   Moreover, the passivated wafers were also used to fabricate Back
   Amorphous-Crystalline Silicon Heterojunction (BACH) cells using double
   side polished n-type FZ wafers. A maximum cell efficiency of 16.7\% is
   obtained for facile native oxide PECVD SiNx bilayer passivated cells
   having V-OC of 641 mV, J(SC) of 33.7 mA/cm(2) and fill-factor of 0.77
   for a 1 cm(2) untextured cell (all measurements having been performed

Abstract = {{The current work details the development and optimization of the
   fabrication processes for nanoelectromechanical resonators such as
   surface and bulk acoustic wave (SAW/BAW) devices that operate in GHz
   range, specifically based on nano-interdigitated transducers (n-IDTs).
   The method combines electron-beam lithography (EBL) and lift-off process
   to fabricate the n-IDTs with finger patterns having line widths of the
   order of 100 nm on AlN/UNCD(aluminum nitride/ultrananocrystalline
   diamond) combined strictures deposited on crystalline silicon. The
   widespread availability of this method has led to the study of the
   combination of processing parameters for both EBL and lift-off for its
   application in the realizadon of n-IDTs. The fabricated devices
   exhibited high frequency range up to 15 GHz with minimum stop-band
   rejection of 25dB. Excellent filtering response of the compatibility of
   fabrication processes with existing manufacturing technologies pave the
   way towards advanced AlN/UNCD based nano-resonators.}},

Abstract = {{Polymeric additives affect the mechanics of phospholipid vesicles, but
   little is known about the effect to supported lipid bilayers that are
   phase segregated on the submicron length scale. In this study, we use
   AFM-based force mapping, by means of breakthrough forces, to quantify
   the spreading pressures and line tensions of raft-forming lipid bilayers
   consisting of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC), egg sphingomyelin
   (ESM), and cholesterol (Chol) in the presence of diblock copolymers
   comprised of polystyrene (PS) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO), PS-b-PEO.
   Varying molecular weights of PS-b-PEO were used in the experiments. The
   presence of the polymer leads to higher breakthrough forces when
   compared to pure DOPC/ESM/Chol bilayers. The lipid-polymer composite
   made with a PS block radius of gyration comparable to the bilayer
   thickness and a PEO block length that is the shortest exhibits the
   highest breakthrough forces and hence is the most stable mechanically.
   The breakthrough force distributions are analyzed to extract the
   spreading pressures and line tensions of the lipid-polymer composites.
   The spreading pressure is seen to increase with the addition of
   PS-b-PEO, and on average, increases with decreasing PEO block length.
   Based on the results, we propose the incorporation of the PS moiety into
   the bilayer core as the main mechanism of this enhanced resistance to
   bilayer breakthrough by the AFM tip.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Volume = {{13}},

Pages = {{2508-2518}},
Abstract = {{In this study, we develop a lab-on-a-chip approach to study pore-scale
   salt precipitation dynamics during CO2 sequestration in saline
   aquifers-a challenge with this carbon management strategy. Three
   distinct phases-CO2 (gas), brine (liquid), and salt (solid)-are tracked
   through microfluidic networks matched to the native geological
   formations. The resulting salt formation dynamics indicate porosity
   decreases of similar to 20\% in keeping with large scale core studies.
   At the network scale, the salt precipitation front moves at a constant
   velocity, similar to 2\% that of the superficial CO2 velocity in this
   case. At the pore-scale, we observe two dominant types of salt
   formation: (1) large bulk crystals, on the order of the pore size (20-50
   mu m), forming early within trapped brine phases; and (2)
   polycrystalline aggregated structures, ranging over broad length scales,
   forming late in the evaporation process and collecting/projecting from
   the CO2-brine interface. Together, these two salt formation mechanisms
   show particular propensity for pore blockage and reduced carbon storage
   capacity.}},

Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},

Pages = {{2519-2527}},
Abstract = {{We introduce a miniature gate valve as a readily implementable strategy
   for actively controlling the flow of liquids on-chip, within a footprint
   of less than one square millimetre. Bubble gates provide for simple,
   consistent and scalable control of liquid flow in microchannel networks,
   are compatible with different bulk microfabrication processes and
   substrate materials, and require neither electrodes nor moving parts. A
   bubble gate consists of two microchannel sections: a liquid-filled
   channel and a gas channel that intercepts the liquid channel to form a
   T-junction. The open or closed state of a bubble gate is determined by
   selecting between two distinct gas pressure levels: the lower level
   corresponds to the ``open{''} state while the higher level corresponds
   to the ``closed'' state. During closure, a gas bubble penetrates from
   the gas channel into the liquid, flanked by a column of equidistantly
   spaced micropillars on each side, until the flow of liquid is completely
   obstructed. We fabricated bubble gates using single-layer soft
   lithographic and bulk silicon micromachining procedures and evaluated
   their performance with a combination of theory and experimentation. We
   assessed the dynamic behaviour during more than 300 open-and-close
   cycles and report the operating pressure envelope for different bubble
   gate configurations and for the working fluids: de-ionized water,
   ethanol and a biological buffer. We obtained excellent agreement between
   the experimentally determined bubble gate operational envelope and a
   theoretical prediction based on static wetting behaviour. We report case
   studies that serve to illustrate the utility of bubble gates for liquid
   sampling in single and multi-layer microfluidic devices. Scalability of
   our strategy was demonstrated by simultaneously addressing 128 bubble
   gates.}},

Abstract = {{Microfluidics (MFs) offers a promising method for the preparation of

   solutions. Spatial separation of MF emulsification and gelation of the
   precursor droplets on chip can address this challenge. In the present
   work, we explored the application of the ``direct injection{''} method
   for the preparation of microgels by adding a highly concentrated polymer
   solution or a gelling agent directly into the precursor droplets. In the
   first system, primary droplets were generated from a dilute aqueous
   solution of agarose, followed by the injection of the concentrated
   agarose solution directly in the primary droplets. The secondary
   droplets served as precursors for microgels. In the second system,
   primary droplets were generated from the low-viscous solution of
   methyl-beta-cyclodextrin and poly(ethylene glycol) end-terminated with
   octadecyl hydrophobic groups. Addition of surfactant directly into the
   primary droplets led to the binding of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin to the
   surfactant, thereby releasing hydrophobized poly(ethylene glycol) to
   form polymer microgels. Our results show that, when optimized, the
   direct injection method can be used for microgel preparation from highly
   viscous liquids and thus this method expands the range of polymers used
   for MF generation of microgels.}},

   the bottom-up fabrication of nanostructures and microstructures. We have
   used this approach to generate high-performance chip-based biosensors

   we explore the applicability of different materials to support the
   electrodeposition and identify the parameters that are essential for
   robust sensor growth. We show that inexpensive materials can be used as
   templates for electrodeposition, and demonstrate that these low-cost
   sensors exhibit clinically-relevant levels of sensitivity and
   specificity. In particular, we prove herein that the glass-based sensors
   successfully detect E. coli in urine, when present at the 100 cfu mu L-1

Title = {{A 3D microfluidic platform incorporating methacrylated gelatin hydrogels
   to study physiological cardiovascular cell-cell interactions}},
Journal = {{LAB ON A CHIP}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{13}},
Pages = {{2591-2598}},
Abstract = {{The cardiovascular system is particularly well-suited to modelling with
   microfluidic technologies, and much progress has been made to create
   microfluidic devices that mimic the microvasculature. In contrast,
   microfluidic platforms that model larger blood vessels and heart valves
   are lacking, despite the clear potential benefits of improved
   physiological relevance and enhanced throughput over traditional cell
   culture technologies. To address this need, we developed a bilayer
   membrane microfluidic device to model the vascular/valvular
   three-dimensional environment. Key features of the platform include
   physiologically-relevant spatial arrangement of multiple cell types,
   fluid flow over an endothelial monolayer, a porous membrane that permits
   heterotypic cell interactions while maintaining cell
   compartmentalization, and a photopolymerizable gelatin methacrylate
   (gel-MA) hydrogel as a physiologically-relevant subendothelial 3D
   matrix. Processing guidelines were defined for successful in-channel
   polymerization of gel-MA hydrogels that were mechanically stable, had
   physiologically-relevant elastic moduli of 2-30 kPa, and supported over
   80\% primary cell viability for at least four days in culture. The
   platform was applied to investigate shear stress-regulated paracrine
   interactions between valvular endothelial cells and valvular
   interstitial cells. The presence of endothelial cells significantly
   suppressed interstitial cell pathological differentiation to a-smooth
   muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts, an effect that was enhanced when
   the endothelium was exposed to flow-induced shear stress. We expect this
   versatile organ-on-a-chip platform to have broad utility for mechanistic
   vascular and valvular biology studies and to be useful for drug
   screening in physiologically-relevant 3D cardiovascular
   microenvironments.}},

Abstract = {{Amber comprises polymerized plant resins that have a remarkable capacity
   for survival in a range of geological environments. Most ambers can be
   traced to coniferous trees and typically combine a broad array of plant
   natural products including terpenoids, carboxylic acids, and associated
   alcohols. Because amber may entomb various organisms at the time of
   production and preserve them with unmatched fidelity, it has been
   studied for centuries. Despite extensive geochemical profiling of
   amber-derived extracts using techniques such as gas-chromatography mass
   spectrometry, to date amber compositional variability has not been
   investigated by time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   (ToF-SIMS). We conducted a series of scans on microtomed surfaces of
   Baltic and Bitterfeld ambers, representing two of Europe's major
   deposits, both of Palaeogene age. We exploited authentic standards of
   mono-methyl succinate and diterpene resin acids to guide interpretation
   of the results. The ToF-SIMS spectra are highly reproducible for each
   amber type considered and highlight subtle differences that are likely
   underscored by differences in age, botanical provenance, and
   post-depositional history. Importantly, the abundance of succinate is
   consistently higher in Baltic amber relative to Bitterfeld amber,
   suggesting they are distinct deposits and not regional variants of each
   other. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive method for measuring
   brain activity and is a strong candidate for brain-computer interface
   (BCI) development. While BCIs can be used as a means of communication
   for individuals with severe disabilities, the majority of existing
   studies have reported BCI evaluations by able-bodied individuals.
   Considering the many differences in body functions and usage scenarios
   between individuals with disabilities and able-bodied individuals,
   involvement of the target population in BCI evaluation is necessary. In
   this review, 39 studies reporting EEG-oriented BCI assessment by
   individuals with disabilities were identified in the past decade. With
   respect to participant populations, a need for assessing BCI performance
   for the pediatric population with severe disabilities was identified as
   an important future direction. Acquiring a reliable communication
   pathway during early stages of development is crucial in avoiding
   learned helplessness in pediatric-onset disabilities. With respect to
   evaluation, augmenting traditional measures of system performance with
   those relating to contextual factors was recommended for realizing
   user-centered designs appropriate for integration in real-life.
   Considering indicators of user state and developing more effective
   training paradigms are recommended for future studies of BCI involving
   individuals with disabilities.}},

Title = {{Scheduling a Dynamic Aircraft Repair Shop with Limited Repair Resources}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{47}},
Pages = {{35-70}},
Abstract = {{We address a dynamic repair shop scheduling problem in the context of
   military aircraft fleet management where the goal is to maintain a full
   complement of aircraft over the long-term. A number of flights, each
   with a requirement for a specific number and type of aircraft, are
   already scheduled over a long horizon. We need to assign aircraft to
   flights and schedule repair activities while considering the flights
   requirements, repair capacity, and aircraft failures. The number of
   aircraft awaiting repair dynamically changes over time due to failures
   and it is therefore necessary to rebuild the repair schedule online. To
   solve the problem, we view the dynamic repair shop as successive static
   repair scheduling sub-problems over shorter time periods. We propose a
   complete approach based on the logic-based Benders decomposition to
   solve the static sub-problems, and design different rescheduling
   policies to schedule the dynamic repair shop. Computational experiments
   demonstrate that the Benders model is able to find and prove optimal
   solutions on average four times faster than a mixed integer programming
   model. The rescheduling approach having both aspects of scheduling over
   a longer horizon and quickly adjusting the schedule increases aircraft
   available in the long term by 10\% compared to the approaches having
   either one of the aspects alone.}},

Abstract = {{Computer simulation is an effective tool for assessing mitigation
   strategies, with recent trends concentrating on agent-based techniques.
   These methods require high computational efforts in order to simulate
   enough scenarios for statistical significance. The population
   individuals and their contacts determined by agent-based simulations
   form a social network. For some network structures it is possible to
   gain high accuracy estimates of contagion spread based on the connection
   structure of the network, an idea that is utilized in this work. A
   representative social network constructed from the 2006 census of the
   Greater Toronto Area (Ontario, Canada) of 5 million individuals in 1.8
   million households is used to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
   We examine the effects of six mitigation strategies with respect to
   their ability to contain disease spread as indicated by pre- and
   post-vaccination reproduction numbers, mean local clustering
   coefficients and degree distributions. One outcome of the analysis
   provides evidence supporting the design of mitigation strategies that
   aim to fragment the population into similarly sized components. While
   our analysis is framed in the context of pandemic disease spread, the
   approach is applicable to any contagion such as computer viruses,
   rumours, social trends, and so on. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{This study introduces a fast locating algorithm for a switched shunt

   whereas other methods separately process individual phase signals. The
   method is training free and established based on algebraic calculations
   with a simple realisation algorithm, which is independent of the power
   system dynamics and parameters. The proposed method is analytically
   investigated and then verified based on the time-domain simulation of
   two study systems. The study systems cover various capacitor-switching

Abstract = {{Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) exhibit complex behaviors as a result of
   their constituent phases and microstructure evolution. In this paper, we
   focus on the numerical simulations of microstructure evolution in SMAs
   using a phase-field model for the two dimensional square- to-
   rectangular martensitic phase transformations. The phase-field model,
   based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, has strong non-linearity,
   thermo-mechanical coupling, and higher-order differential terms and
   presents substantial challenges for numerical simulations. The
   isogeometric analysis, developed in this paper using the rich NURBS
   basis functions, offers several advantages in solving such complex
   problems with higher-order partial differential equations as the problem
   at hand. To our best knowledge, we report here for the first time the
   use of the new method in the study of microstructure evolution in SMAs.
   The numerical experiments of microstructure evolution have been carried
   out on the FePd SMA specimen. The results are in good agreement with
   those previously reported in the literature.}},

Abstract = {{Co-gasification of biomass, namely, switchgrass, with coal and fluid
   coke was performed to investigate the availability of the gasification
   catalysts to the mixed feedstock, especially alkali and alkaline earth
   elements, naturally present on switchgrass. Rates of CO2 gasification of
   the single and mixed materials were measured at temperatures between 750
   and 950 degrees C and atmospheric pressure by thermogravimetry. High
   interparticle mobility of the catalysts is indicated by a prompt and
   lasting effect on the mixed feed gasification rate when compared with
   the separate rates. The switchgrass coal mixtures show a deactivation
   (antagonism), attributed to sequestration of the mobile alkali elements
   by reaction with aluminosilicate minerals in coal to form inactive
   alkali aluminosilicates, such as KAlSi3O8 and KAlSiO4. Remaining
   catalytic activity is evident when excess alkali is present in the feed
   mixture to satisfy the stoichiometric requirements of these deactivation
   reactions. In co-gasification of switchgrass with fluid coke, which has
   little interfering inorganic matter, a synergism is noted in the
   gasification of the mixed feed. The results document the effects of fuel
   mixture, composition of the coal or coke ash, and the gasification
   temperature on this behavior.}},

   production from citrus waste}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN-MAR}},
Abstract = {{The production of biofuel from cellulosic residues can have both
   environmental and financial benefits. A particular benefit is that it
   can alleviate competition for land conventionally used for food and feed
   production. In this research, we investigate greenhouse gas (GHG)
   emissions associated with the production of ethanol, biomethane,
   limonene and digestate from citrus waste, a byproduct of the citrus
   processing industry. The study represents the first life cycle-based
   evaluations of citrus waste biorefineries. Two biorefinery
   configurations are studied-a large biorefinery that converts citrus
   waste into ethanol, biomethane, limonene and digestate, and a small
   biorefinery that converts citrus waste into biomethane, limonene and
   digestate. Ethanol is assumed to be used as E85, displacing gasoline as
   a light-duty vehicle fuel; biomethane displaces natural gas for
   electricity generation, limonene displaces acetone in solvents, and
   digestate from the anaerobic digestion process displaces synthetic
   fertilizer. System expansion and two allocation methods (energy, market
   value) are considered to determine emissions of co-products.
   Considerable GHG reductions would be achieved by producing and utilizing
   the citrus waste-based products in place of the petroleum-based or other
   non-renewable products. For the large biorefinery, ethanol used as E85
   in light-duty vehicles results in a 134\% reduction in GHG emissions
   compared to gasoline-fueled vehicles when applying a system expansion
   approach. For the small biorefinery, when electricity is generated from
   biomethane rather than natural gas, GHG emissions are reduced by 77\%
   when applying system expansion. The life cycle GHG emissions vary
   substantially depending upon biomethane leakage rate, feedstock GHG
   emissions and the method to determine emissions assigned to co-products.
   Among the process design parameters, the biomethane leakage rate is
   critical, and the ethanol produced in the large biorefinery would not
   meet EISA's requirements for cellulosic biofuel if the leakage rate is
   higher than 9.7\%. For the small biorefinery, there are no GHG emission
   benefits in the production of biomethane if the leakage rate is higher
   than 11.5\%. Compared to system expansion, the use of energy and market
   value allocation methods generally results in higher estimates of GHG
   emissions for the primary biorefinery products (i.e., smaller reductions
   in emissions compared to reference systems).}},

Abstract = {{A car-following assisting system named the rear window notification
   display (RWND) was developed, with the aim of improving a driver's
   manual car-following performance. The RWND presented lead-car
   acceleration and time headway (THW) (i.e., intervehicle distance divided
   by the speed of the following car) on the rear window of a lead car,
   which was driven automatically. A simulator-based experiment with 22
   participants showed that the RWND reduced both the mean and standard
   deviation of THW but did not increase the occurrence of potentially
   unsafe headways of less than 1 s. The parameter estimation of a common
   linear car-following model showed that drivers accomplished the
   performance improvements by adopting higher control gains with respect
   to intervehicle distance, relative speed, and acceleration. A
   postexperiment questionnaire revealed that the display was generally not
   regarded as a distraction nor did participants think that it provided
   too much information, with means of 4.0 and 2.9, respectively, on a
   scale from one (completely disagree) to ten (completely agree). The
   results of this study suggest that the RWND can be used along with
   Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control to increase traffic flow without

Title = {{Synergies between climate change adaptation and mitigation in
   development Case studies of Amman, Jakarta, and Dar es Salaam}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLIMATE CHANGE STRATEGIES AND MANAGEMENT}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{95-111}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how cities at
   different stages of development each subject to its own challenges in
   adapting to climate change can manage greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
   Design/methodology/approach - Case studies are undertaken for three
   cities: Amman, Jakarta and Dar es Salaam, including determination of GHG
   emissions and analysis of climate change data (where available) for
   each.
   Findings - In Amman, the most climate-sensitive municipal service is
   water; Jordan is exceptionally dry, and nearly 15 per cent of all
   electricity consumption is by the water authority. Jakarta has already
   experienced extreme flooding. The climate vulnerabilities associated
   with sea-level rise are intensified by subsidence in parts of Jakarta.
   Alternating floods and droughts are climate impacts already experienced
   in Dar es Salaam. Droughts have impacted Tanzania's electricity
   infrastructure disrupting hydroelectricity production, requiring new
   natural gas infrastructure to maintain power, thereby increasing GHG
   emissions. Nonetheless, Dar es Salaam's GHG emissions at 0.56 t
   CO(2)e/cap are small compared to Amman and Jakarta at 3.66 and 4.92 t
   CO(2)e/cap., respectively.
   Originality/value - Synergist development strategies, addressing climate
   change mitigation and adaptation are suggested. In Amman an increased
   share of photovoltaic electricity production might be used for service
   provision, especially for energy needs surrounding water supply.
   Advanced slum upgrading in Jakarta could see relocation of the at-risk
   poor to safe areas with energy efficient homes connected to public
   transit and decentralized, community-based electricity generation. The
   focus in Dar es Salaam community-based waste-to-energy facilities would
   reduce climate change impacts and vulnerabilities while addressing
   energy poverty in poor communities.}},

Pages = {{3187-3199}},
Abstract = {{We report the synthesis and crystal structure analysis of a series of
   halo-substituted phenoxy-boron subphthalocyanine (phenoxy-BsubPc)
   derivatives, including meta-halogenated-phenoxy-BsubPcs,
   ortho-halogenated-phenoxy-BsubPcs, pentabromophenoxy-BsubPc and
   pentachlorophenoxy-BsubPc. We have found that the majority of the
   resulting solid state arrangements contain definite halogen bonds, which
   have not previously been seen in the solid state arrangement of
   phenoxy-BsubPcs. We observed that the presence and strength of halogen
   bonds are dependent upon the particular halogen atom. We used
   semi-empirical methods to calculate the approximate halogen bond
   strength for the meta-halogenated-phenoxy-BsubPcs. This comparative
   approach is useful in cases where a structurally-similar isomer exists
   with a solid state arrangement that is similar, but which differs by
   exactly one type of significant intermolecular interaction. We also
   observed that the tendency to form halogen bonds in phenoxy-BsubPcs
   depends on the position of the halogen atom, and increases in the order:
   para < ortho < meta. The presence of halogen bonds facilitates the
   arrangement of BsubPc into networks of closely associated molecules
   extending into two and three dimensions, resulting in solid state
   arrangements which are noteworthy exceptions to the typical
   phenoxy-BsubPc packing motifs.}},

Title = {{Microdevice array-based identification of distinct mechanobiological
   response profiles in layer-specific valve interstitial cells}},
Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{673-680}},
Abstract = {{Aortic valve homeostasis is mediated by valvular interstitial cells
   (VICs) found in spatially distinct and mechanically dynamic layers of
   the valve leaflet. Disease progression is associated with the
   pathological differentiation of VICs to myofibroblasts, but the
   mechanobiological response profiles of cells specific to different
   layers in the leaflet remains undefined. Conventional mechanically
   dynamic macroscale culture technologies require a large number of cells
   per set of environmental conditions. However, large scale expansion of
   primary VICs in vitro does not maintain in vivo phenotypes, and hence
   conventional macroscale techniques are not well-suited to systematically
   probe response of these cell types to combinatorially manipulated
   mechanobiological cues. To address this issue, we developed a
   microfabricated composite material screening array to determine the
   combined effects of dynamic substrate stretch, soluble cues and matrix
   proteins on small populations of primary cells. We applied this system
   to study VICs isolated from distinct layers of the valve leaflet and
   determined that (1) mechanical stability and cellular adhesion to the
   engineered composite materials were significantly improved as compared
   to conventional stretching technologies; (2) VICs demonstrate
   layer-specific mechanobiological profiles; and (3) mechanical
   stimulation, matrix proteins and soluble cues produce integrated and
   distinct responses in layer-specific VIC populations. Strikingly,
   myofibroblast differentiation was most significantly influenced by cell
   origin, despite the presence of potent mechanobiological cues such as
   applied strain and TGF-beta 1. These results demonstrate that
   spatially-distinct VIC subpopulations respond differentially to
   microenvironmental cues, with implications for valve tissue engineering
   and pathobiology. The developed platform enables rapid identification of
   biological phenomena arising from systematically manipulating the
   cellular microenvironment, and may be of utility in screening
   mechanosensitive cell cultures with applications in drug screening,
   tissue engineering and fundamental cell biology.}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the multi-pulse global heteroclinic bifurcations
   and chaotic dynamics for nonlinear, nonplanar oscillations of the
   parametrically excited viscoelastic moving belts by using an extended
   Melnikov method in the resonant case. Applying the method of multiple
   scales, the Galerkin's approach and the theory of normal form, the
   explicit normal form is obtained for the case of 1:1 internal resonance
   and primary parametric resonance. Studies are performed for the
   heteroclinic bifurcations of the unperturbed system and for the
   characteristics of the hyperbolic dynamics of the dissipative system,
   respectively. The extended Melnikov method is used to investigate the
   Shilnikov type multi-pulse bifurcations and chaotic dynamics of the
   viscoelastic moving belt. Based on the investigation, the geometric
   structure of the multi-pulse orbits is described in the four-dimensional
   phase space. Numerical simulations show that the Shilnikov type
   multi-pulse chaotic motions can occur. Furthermore, numerical
   simulations lead to the discovery of the new shapes of chaotic motion.
   Overall, both theoretical and numerical studies suggest that chaos for
   the Smale horseshoe sense in motion exists.}},

Abstract = {{This study examined the effects of pipe materials (iron, copper, lead
   and PVC) and orthophosphate on chloramine decay and
   N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation under stagnant, laminar and
   turbulent conditions using modified pipe loops. As expected, chloramine
   decay rates generally increased with increasing flow velocity. In the
   presence of orthophosphate, chloramine degradation in the iron loop
   increased regardless of flow conditions, whereas chloramine decay rates
   decreased for the copper and lead loops, especially under turbulent
   conditions. NDMA formation in the copper loop was consistently higher
   than it was in the PVC control loop under laminar conditions, supporting
   the theory of a possible catalytic effect of copper on NDMA formation
   (as reported elsewhere). Iron catalysis of NDMA formation became more
   prominent in the presence of orthophosphate, but copper catalysis became
   less significant after the addition of orthophosphate. Only in the
   copper loop, the released metal concentrations were decreased under
   laminar conditions compared with turbulent flow, and they were also
   reduced effectively due to the addition of orthophosphate, suggesting
   that the catalytic effect was not primarily due to dissolved copper but
   likely included copper-based solids (corrosion products).}},

Journal = {{REGENERATIVE MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-37}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Aim: Recovery following nerve transection declines when target
   reconnection is delayed for prolonged periods. GDNF has previously been
   shown to promote motor axon regeneration following delayed nerve repair.
   Materials \& methods: We constructed delivery systems using fibrin gels
   containing free GDNF or poly(lactide-co-glycolide) microspheres with
   GDNF. The delivery systems were implanted with fluorescent fibrinogen
   surrounding the common fibular (CF; peroneal) nerve in transgenic Thy-1
   GFP rats (whose axons express GFP) to track degradation of the system. A
   delayed nerve repair model was designed by transecting the rat CF nerve,
   where nerve regeneration was prevented by ligating the two stumps to
   surrounding muscle for 2 months prior to resuture. At resuture, either a
   delivery system with GDNF or an additional group consisting of fibrin
   gels with empty microspheres were implanted surrounding the repair site.
   In an additional positive control, the CF was transected and repaired
   immediately without delay. Results: ELISA assays demonstrated GDNF
   release in vitro for 2 weeks from fibrin gels with GDNF microspheres.
   Implanted delivery systems, including GDNF microspheres, remained
   surrounding the nerve for at least 10 days compared with 3 days for free
   GDNF. Four weeks after repair, histomorphometry of distal nerve
   cross-sections taken 20 mm from the repair site demonstrated increased
   fiber diameter and myelin thickness due to release of GDNF from
   microspheres compared with empty microspheres. Additionally, the number
   of motoneurons that regenerated their axons to the same site increased
   to comparable levels as immediate repair due to the extended delivery of
   GDNF from microspheres. Conclusion: These findings demonstrate that
   early measures of nerve regeneration after delayed nerve repair is
   improved by GDNF microspheres implanted at the coaptation site.}},

Title = {{Radiative recombination mechanisms in individual wurtzite ZnSe nanowires
   with a defect-free single-crystalline microstructure}},

Abstract = {{Photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy performed on arrays of semiconductor
   nanowires (NWs) suffers from ensemble broadening of PL lines, and fails
   to separate the PL from NWs of different crystal structures in the
   ensemble. Even the results on PL from single NWs are not devoid of
   ambiguity. This is because the influence of structural defects in NWs,
   such as stacking faults, twin boundaries and dislocations, on their
   optical spectra cannot be accounted for since the structural
   characteristics of the same NW remain largely unknown. We performed
   low-temperature PL spectroscopy on individual wurtzite (WZ) ZnSe NWs,
   and confirmed a homogeneous single-crystalline microstructure without
   any extended defects in these NWs, thus excluding any role of structural
   imperfections in their optical spectra. The luminescence is shown to be
   dominated solely by native point defects, while no role of extrinsic
   impurities was found. The radiative recombination is shown to originate
   from excitons bound to vacancies of Zn (V-Zn), V-Zn-complexes, and their
   phonon replicas. The binding energies of the acceptor-bound excitons,
   ionization energies of the acceptors, and average number of phonons
   emitted for shallow donor-V-Zn acceptor pair related transition were
   determined. Distinct from previous studies on PL from arrays of ZnSe
   NWs, this work provides an unambiguous interpretation of the PL spectra
   and assignment of PL peaks to WZ ZnSe. Narrow excitonic emission of
   linewidths 2.9 meV indicate excellent optical quality of WZ ZnSe NWs.}},

   other patients in other place or something else. Radio Frequency
   Identification {[}RFID] can help us to track doctors, nurses or patients
   to render better health services to cure patients. The aim of this
   project was first, to identify and discuss the most advantages and
   disadvantages of the RFID in hospitals, second, to identify and discuss
   some experience in the entire world. This study reviewed the literature
   on the RFID applications in healthcare. The literature search was
   conducted with the help of library, data bank, and also searches engines
   available at Google, and conference proceedings. For our searches, we
   employed the following keywords and their combinations: RFID,
   healthcare, hospital, Medical Errors, Emergency Room, and Emergency
   Medicine in the searching areas of title, keyword or abstract. Technical
   reports were excluded since we focused on research papers. More than 53
   articles were collected and assessed 26 of them were selected based on
   their relevancy. It can be used to guide future research in this field.
   Care providers can monitor their patient, products, and medical staff.
   To increase quality of care and decrease waiting time, care providers
   should use RFID technology to track and control patients, professional,
   and medical products.}},

Abstract = {{The majority of available cardiomyocyte markers are intercellular
   proteins, limiting our ability to enrich live cardiomyocytes from
   heterogeneous cell preparations in the absence of genetic labeling.
   Here, we describe enrichment of live cardiomyocytes from the hearts of
   adult mice in a label-free microfluidic approach. The separation device
   consisted of a vertical column (15 mm long, 700 mu m diameter), placed
   between permanent magnets resulting in a field strength of 1.23 T. To
   concentrate the field at the column wall, the column was wrapped with 69
   mu m diameter nickel wire. Before passing the cells through the column,
   the cardiomyocytes in the cell suspension had been rendered paramagnetic
   by treatment of the adult mouse heart cell preparation with sodium
   nitrite (2.5 mM) for 20 min on ice. The cell suspension was loaded into
   the vertical column from the top and upon settling, the non-myocytes
   were removed by the upward flow from the column. The cardiomyocytes were
   then collected from the column by applying a higher flow rate (144 mu
   l/min). We found that by applying a separation flow rate of 4.2 mu l/min
   in the first step, we can enrich live adult cardiomyocytes to 93\% +/-
   2\% in a label-free manner. The cardiomyocytes maintained viability
   immediately after separation and upon 24 h in culture. (C) 2013 American

Title = {{A comparative assessment of multi-sensor data fusion techniques for
   freeway traffic speed estimation using microsimulation modeling}},
Journal = {{TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH PART C-EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Pages = {{33-48}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Real-time traffic speed estimation is a fundamental task for urban
   traffic management centers and is often a critical element of
   Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). For this purpose, various
   sensors are used to collect traffic information. For many applications,
   the information provided by individual sensors is incomplete, inaccurate
   and/or unreliable. Therefore, a fusion based estimate provides a more
   effective approach towards traffic speed estimation. In this paper,
   seven multi-sensor data fusion-based estimation techniques are
   investigated. All methods are implemented and compared in terms of their
   ability to fuse data from loop detectors and probe vehicles to
   accurately estimate freeway traffic speed. For the purposes of a
   rigorous comparison, data are generated from a microsimulation model of
   a major freeway in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). The microsimulation
   model includes loop detectors and a newly implemented traffic monitoring
   system that detects Bluetooth-enabled devices traveling past roadside
   Bluetooth receivers, allowing for an automated method of probe vehicle
   data collection. To establish the true traffic speed that each fusion
   method attempts to estimate, all vehicles in the microsimulation model
   are equipped with GPS devices. Results show that most data fusion
   techniques improve accuracy over single sensor approaches. Furthermore,
   the analysis shows that the improvement by data fusion depends on the
   technique, the number of probe vehicles, and the traffic conditions. (C)

Abstract = {{An advanced rule-based transit signal priority (TSP) control method is

   condition. The new method also adopts a priority plan redevelopment
   feature that enables modifying or even switching the already implemented
   priority plan to accommodate changes in the traffic conditions. The
   proposed method utilizes conventional green extension and red truncation
   strategies and also two new strategies including green truncation and
   queue clearance. The new method is evaluated against a typical active
   TSP strategy and also the base case scenario assuming no TSP control in
   microsimulation. The evaluation results indicate that the proposed
   method can produce significant benefits in reducing the bus delay time

Abstract = {{A case study of Toronto is used to demonstrate strategies for developing

   check on the estimation guidelines employed. Under the planned policies,
   a 31\% reduction in per capita greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is
   estimated, with most of the savings due to reduced electrical emissions
   intensity under Ontario's Integrated Systems Plan, as well as a
   reduction in internal combustion automobile use. With the more
   aggressive scenario, buildings, energy and transport-related GHG
   emissions could be reduced to 6 Mt CO(2)e, or 1.9 tonnes per capita, a
   reduction in per capita emissions of 71\% compared to the base case.
   Significant strategies under the aggressive scenario include

Abstract = {{In recent years, bead foaming technology has been of great interest to
   researchers because it represents a breakthrough in the production of
   low density plastic foamed components that have a complex geometrical
   structure. This helps to expand the market for plastic foams by
   broadening their applications. Despite earlier, valuable studies on the
   characterization and manufacture of bead foams, there has been little
   investigation of the critical parameters in the foamed bead
   manufacturing process. To provide an insight into the mechanism behind
   bead foaming technology, a lab-scale autoclave system for foamed bead
   manufacturing is developed and the critical processing parameters were
   studied. Foamed beads were obtained under various processing conditions
   with this lab-scale system while using carbon dioxide as the blowing
   agent. The cellular morphology and melting/crystallization behaviours of
   the beads are examined and discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {{Effects of sensorimotor trunk impairments on trunk and upper limb joint
   kinematics and kinetics during sitting pivot transfers in individuals
   with a spinal cord injury}},

Volume = {{28}},

Abstract = {{Background: Depending on the level and severity of the sensorimotor
   impairment in individuals with a spinal cord injury, the subsequent
   reduced seated postural stability and strength generating-capacity at
   the upper limbs could affect performance during sitting pivot transfer.
   This study aimed to determine the effects of sensorimotor impairments on
   head, trunk and upper limb movement and efforts during sitting pivot
   transfers.
   Methods: Twenty-six individuals with a spinal cord injury participated
   and were stratified in two subgroups: with (N=15) and without voluntary
   motor control (N=11) of their lower back and abdominal muscles.
   Kinematics and kinetics of sitting pivot transfer were collected using a
   transfer assessment system. Mean joint angles and movement amplitudes
   and peak and average joint moments were compared between subgroups using
   independent Student t-tests (P<0.05) for the weight-bearing sitting
   pivot transfer phases.
   Findings: The subgroup without voluntary control of their lower back and
   abdominal muscles had significantly greater forward trunk flexion
   compared to the other subgroup resulting in higher wrist extension and
   elbow flexion at both upper limbs. No significant joint moment
   difference was found between the subgroups. Interpretation: Individuals
   with spinal cord injury who have no voluntary motor control of their
   abdominal and lower back muscles increase forward trunk flexion during
   sitting pivot transfers 1) to increase stiffness of their spine that may
   optimize the strength-generating ability of their thoracohumeral muscles
   and 2) to lower their center of mass that may facilitate lift-off and
   enhance the overall stability during sitting pivot transfers. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{In this paper, we consider the recurrent failures of several repairable
   units, which can only be observed at periodic inspection times. A unit
   is not aging over the period between a failure and its detection. The
   failure times are interval censored by the periodic assessment times.
   The observed data consists of censoring intervals of failure times and
   the unobserved data are the actual ages of the units at the failure
   times. We formulate the likelihood function and use several iterative
   algorithms to find the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the
   parameters. The complete Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, the EM
   gradient, full Newton-Raphson (NR), and the Simplex method are used. We
   derive recursive equations to calculate the expected values required in
   the algorithms. We estimate the parameters for four failure datasets,
   assuming that the failures follow a non-homogeneous Poisson process
   (NHPP). Three datasets are obtained from a hospital for the components
   of general infusion pump, and the fourth dataset is simulated. Since the
   estimation could take a long time, we compare the performance of the
   algorithms in terms of the required number of iterations to converge,
   the total execution time, and the precision of the estimated parameters.
   We also use Monte Carlo and Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation as the
   substitutes for the recursive procedures in the Expectation step of the
   EM gradient and compare the results. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{131}},
Pages = {{158-166}},

Abstract = {{The present study investigates the use of ammonium sulfate as a
   lixiviant in the recovery of rare earth elements (REE) from clays. Rare
   earth ions are physically adsorbed on clay minerals, with concentrations
   ranging from 0.05 to 0.5 wt.\%. It was previously shown that they could
   be easily recovered via an ion exchange mechanism during leaching with
   inorganic monovalent salt solutions (such as ammonium sulfate). A
   standardized desorption procedure was established to systematically
   investigate the influence of leaching conditions such as lixiviant
   concentration, temperature, pH and agitation rate on desorption kinetics
   and REE extraction levels. It was determined that the optimum leaching
   conditions, leading to 80-90\% total REE extraction, required pH values
   in the range 3-4 and moderate temperatures (<50 degrees C) in order to
   avoid lanthanide precipitation/loss via hydrolysis. Various lixiviant
   concentrations above a certain ``cut-off{''} level (about 6 times the
   stoichiometric requirement) did not affect extraction levels, while the
   agitation speed was irrelevant with regards to leaching efficiency,
   requiring only sufficient stirring to ensure complete slurry suspension
   for effective mass-transfer. Extraction kinetics were found to be very
   fast, with less than 5 min to reach terminal extraction, and independent
   of lixiviant concentration, pH, temperature and agitation speed. (C)

Journal = {{INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{578-589}},
Abstract = {{Recapitulating native tissue organization is a central challenge in
   regenerative medicine as it is critical for generating functional
   tissues. One strategy to generate engineered tissues with predictable
   and appropriate organization is to mimic the gene expression patterning
   process that organizes tissues in the developing embryo. In a developing
   embryo, correct organization is accomplished by tissue patterning via
   the generation of temporal and spatial patterns of gene expression
   coupled with, and leading to, extensive cellular re-organization.
   Methods to pattern gene expression in vitro could therefore provide both
   better models for understanding the cellular and molecular events taking
   place during tissue morphogenesis and novel strategies for engineering
   tissues with more realistic and complex architectures. While a few
   attempts have been made to genetically pattern tissues in vitro, these
   do not produce sharp predictable patterning. In both the embryo and an
   in vitro tissue, patterning often occurs during extensive cell
   re-organization but how the dynamics of gene induction and cell
   re-distribution interact to impact the final outcome of patterning and
   ultimately tissue organization is not known. Understanding this
   relationship and the system parameters that dictate robust pattern
   formation is critical for engineering genetic patterning in vitro to
   organize artificial tissues. We set out to identify key requirements for
   pattern formation by patterning gene expression in vitro in sheets of
   re-distributing cells using a drug-inducible gene expression system and
   patterned drug delivery to mimic morphogen gene induction. Based on our
   experimental observations, we develop a mathematical model that allows
   us to identify and experimentally verify the conditions under which
   generation of sharp gene expression patterns is possible in vitro. Our
   results highlight the importance of coordinating gene induction dynamics
   and cellular movement in order to achieve robust pattern formation.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents an intelligent algorithm based on Adaptive
   Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and statistical methods for
   measuring job stress in noisy and complex petrochemical plants. Job
   stress is evaluated against health, safety, environment and ergonomics
   (HSEE) program in the integrated algorithm. The algorithm is composed of
   seventeen distinct steps. To achieve the objectives of this study,
   standard questionnaires with respect to HSEE are completed by operators.
   The average results for each category of HSEE are used as inputs and job
   stress is used as output for the algorithm. Moreover, operators' stress
   level with respect to HSEE is evaluated by the algorithm. Finally,
   operators with weak stress level are identified. The advantage and
   superiority of the intelligent algorithm are shown by error analysis in
   contrast with conventional regression approaches. This is the first
   study that introduces an integrated intelligent algorithm for assessment
   and improvement of job stress and HSEE in noisy, complex and uncertain

Abstract = {{The environmental stability of a solid silicotungstic acid
   (SiWA)-H3PO4-poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) electrolyte in electrochemical
   supercapacitor (EC) applications was improved by the incorporation of
   nano-SiO2. Under ambient conditions, enhanced water retention and
   improved stability were observed for the electrolyte with SiO2 compared
   to the electrolyte without SiO2. Due to the strengthening in bond
   interaction between SiO2 and water molecules, the electrolyte with SiO2
   exhibited a more consistent proton conductivity than the one without
   SiO2. In addition, a cross-linking effect of SiO2 on the PVA polymer was
   observed as a secondary function. The performance of the SiO2-containing
   electrolyte was evaluated in a planar double layer EC. The thin solid EC
   demonstrated high rate capability of 5,000 Vs(-1) in cyclic
   voltammograms with good environmental stability and excellent cycle life

Abstract = {{Phenol-Urea-Formaldehyde (PUF) binder coated mineral fibres' mechanical
   properties have been observed to degrade during ageing at elevated
   temperatures and humidity, while alkanol amine-acid anhydride binder
   based mineral fibres exhibited better ageing properties for same
   duration of ageing. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and
   time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were employed
   to identify the chemical changes occurring in the PUF binder coated
   mineral fibres and alkanol amine-acid anhydride binder coated mineral
   fibres during that ageing. The samples were aged in a climate chamber
   for 7 days at 70 degrees C and 95\% relative humidity. In the case of
   the PUF binder coated fibres, quantitative XPS measurements showed some
   significant changes in the atomic composition of the PUF binder coated
   mineral fibres after ageing, including decreased urea and carbonyl
   groups concentrations. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied on
   the positive and negative ToF-SIMS spectra of the PUF binder coated
   mineral fibres, showing a decrease in the concentration of the nitrogen
   containing peaks during ageing. This decrease was attributed to the
   depolymerisation of the binder due to hydrolysis of amide, methylene
   ether and methylene linkages between urea groups present in the PUF
   binder. In the case of the alkanol amine-acid anhydride binder coated
   mineral fibres, both XPS and ToF-SIMS techniques consistently showed
   that the surface chemical composition of the organic components of the
   alkanol amine-acid anhydride binder coated mineral fibres did not change
   appreciably after 7 days of climate ageing, which is relevant to the
   good retention of mechanical strength for products formulated with the
   alkanol amine-acid anhydride binder. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{A method of designing low-density parity-check codes for
   bandwidth-efficient high-order modulation is proposed. A multi-edge-type
   LDPC code ensemble is used to improve the correspondence between
   modulation bit-channel capacity and bit-level protection in a
   bit-interleaved coded modulation system. A key innovation is the
   development of a multi-dimensional extrinsic information transfer (EXIT)
   vector field technique for the analysis and design of multi-edge-type
   codes. A condition, sufficient for the decoder to converge, is derived
   on the multi-dimensional EXIT vector field, and this condition is used
   as a constraint in code optimization. Code designs indicate that the
   proposed method produces codes matching the performance of codes
   designed using best available methods in ensemble threshold, and is
   capable of achieving identical finite-length error rates with shorter
   block-lengths. In addition to simplified design complexity, the
   resulting codes allow for low-complexity implementation and
   rate-adaptivity, and hence are well-suited for adaptive modulation
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{IN-738LC nickel-based superalloy was joined by transient liquid phase
   diffusion bonding using AMS 4777 filler alloy. The bonding process was
   carried out at 1050 degrees C under vacuum atmosphere for various hold
   times. Microstructures of the joints were studied by optical and
   scanning electron microscopy. Continuous centerline eutectic phases,
   characterized as nickel-rich boride, chromium-rich boride and
   nickel-rich silicide were observed at the bonds with incomplete
   isothermal solidification. In addition to the centerline eutectic
   products, precipitation of boron-rich particles was observed in the
   diffusion affected zone. The results showed that, as the bonding time
   was increased to 75 mm, the width of the eutectic zone was completely
   removed and the joint was isothermally solidified. Homogenization of
   isothermally solidified joints at 1120 degrees C for 300 min resulted in
   the elimination of intermetallic phases formed at the diffusion affected
   zone and the formation of significant gamma' precipitates in the joint

Abstract = {{There is an increasing effort in the search and characterization of
   materials that can function as artificial three-dimensional cellular

   micrometer-size hydrogel particles (microgels) offers the ease of cell
   visualization, the transport of nutrients, and the ability to generate
   large combinatorial libraries of cellular microenvironments. In the
   present work, we report an atomic force microscopy (AFM) method for the
   characterization of an average Young's modulus and the stress relaxation
   time of micrometer-size polymer microgel particles. We studied the
   mechanical properties of agarose microgels with different polymer
   concentration at room temperature and 37 degrees C (the temperature of
   cell culture). We examined the temporal variation in the Young modulus
   of cell-free and cell-laden microgels under physiological conditions.
   Furthermore, we correlated the mechanical properties of the microgels
   laden with a single carcinoma associated fibroblast (CAF) cell with the
   spatial distribution of collagen around the cell. This work is
   potentially useful for studies of changes in cellular microenvironments,
   when cells locally degrade the matrix or secrete molecules that change

Abstract = {{This paper investigates quantization of channel state information (CSI)
   and bit allocation across wireless links in a multi-source, single-relay
   cooperative cellular network. Our goal is to minimize the loss in
   performance, measured as the achievable sum rate, due to limited-rate
   quantization of CSI. We develop both a channel quantization scheme and
   allocation of limited feedback bits to the various wireless links. We
   assume that the quantized CSI is reported to a central node responsible
   for optimal resource allocation. We first derive tight lower and upper
   bounds on the difference in rates between the perfect CSI and quantized
   CSI scenarios. These bounds are then used to derive an effective
   quantizer for arbitrary channel distributions. Next, we use these bounds
   to optimize the allocation of bits across the links subject to a budget
   on total available quantization bits. In particular, we show that the
   optimal bit allocation algorithm allocates more bits to those links in
   the network that contribute the most to the sum-rate. Finally, the paper
   investigates the choice of the central node; we show that this choice
   plays a significant role in CSI bits required to achieve a target
   performance level.}},

Abstract = {{A rapid, simple and specific cancer cell counting sensor would allow for
   early detection and better disease management. We have developed a novel
   cell counting device that can specifically count 125 prostate cancer
   cells in both complex media with serum and a mixed cell population
   containing non-target cells within 15 min. The microfabricated glass
   chip with exposed gold apertures utilizes the anti-EpCAM antibody to
   selectively count prostate cancer cells via differential pulse
   voltammetry. The newly developed sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity
   and selectivity. The cells remain viable throughout the counting process
   and can be used for further analysis. This device could have utility for
   future applications in early stage cancer diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Starling Flock Networks Manage Uncertainty in Consensus at Low Cost}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Flocks of starlings exhibit a remarkable ability to maintain cohesion as
   a group in highly uncertain environments and with limited, noisy
   information. Recent work demonstrated that individual starlings within
   large flocks respond to a fixed number of nearest neighbors, but until
   now it was not understood why this number is seven. We analyze
   robustness to uncertainty of consensus in empirical data from multiple
   starling flocks and show that the flock interaction networks with six or
   seven neighbors optimize the trade-off between group cohesion and
   individual effort. We can distinguish these numbers of neighbors from
   fewer or greater numbers using our systems-theoretic approach to
   measuring robustness of interaction networks as a function of the
   network structure, i.e., who is sensing whom. The metric quantifies the
   disagreement within the network due to disturbances and noise during
   consensus behavior and can be evaluated over a parameterized family of
   hypothesized sensing strategies (here the parameter is number of
   neighbors). We use this approach to further show that for the range of
   flocks studied the optimal number of neighbors does not depend on the
   number of birds within a flock; rather, it depends on the shape, notably
   the thickness, of the flock. The results suggest that robustness to
   uncertainty may have been a factor in the evolution of flocking for
   starlings. More generally, our results elucidate the role of the
   interaction network on uncertainty management in collective behavior,
   and motivate the application of our approach to other biological
   networks.}},

Title = {{An economic evaluation of perioperative adverse events associated with
   spinal surgery}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{44-53}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Besides their clinical impact, the economic impact
   of health care-related adverse events (AEs) is significant. Although a
   number of studies have attempted to estimate the economic impact of AEs,
   few have directly linked costs to clinician-reported event severity.
   PURPOSE: To estimate the economic impact in terms of the incremental
   cost and length of stay (LOS), attributable to different severity grades
   of AEs that occurred during perioperative spinal surgery.
   STUDY DESIGN: Health economic evaluation of data from a prospective
   observational study from the perspective of an academic hospital.
   PATIENT SAMPLE: Consecutive patients at a single, tertiary-quaternary
   care institution who have undergone inpatient spinal surgery.
   OUTCOME MEASURES: The cost and LOS impacts with respect to the severity
   of the AEs.
   METHODS: We analyzed 4 years of patient discharges between January 1,
   2007 and December 31, 2010. The Spine Adverse Events Severity instrument
   was completed by the surgical team at discharge. Clinical impacts of the
   AEs were graded as I (requires no/minimal treatment), II (requires
   treatment and is not likely to cause long-term {[}>6 months] sequelae),
   III (requires treatment and is most likely to cause long-term sequelae),
   and IV (death). A total of 1,815 records were linked with the
   patient-level costing information. We matched each AE case with four
   control cases based on their propensity score for the risk of
   experiencing an AE, regressed against case characteristics. We estimated
   an incremental cost and LOS for each severity grade by calculating the
   differences in means across cases and controls. We conducted a
   sensitivity analysis by estimating the alternate models using
   generalized linear model (GLM) regression with a gamma log link.
   RESULTS: Adverse events were reported in 316 (17.4\%) cases, with 126 of
   these patients (40.2\%) experiencing multiple events. The incremental
   cost/LOS for each severity grade are as follows: I=\$ 4,224
   (p=.0351)/3.63 days (p=.0001); II=\$23,500 (p<.0001)/14.03 days
   (p<.0001); III=\$147,285 (p=.0036)/74.50 days (p=.0018); and
   IV=\$121,366 (p=.0323)/46.44 days (p=.0036). The total cost in
   millions/LOS (days) associated with each grade over the 4-year study
   period are as follows: I=\$0.66 million/569.9 days; II=\$2.96
   million/1,767.8 days; III=\$4.27 million/2,160.5 days; and IV=\$0.49
   million/185.8 days. Our sensitivity analysis produced comparable overall
   results using alternate modeling techniques. Overall, AEs contributed an
   estimated \$8.38 million (16.0\% of the total costs for all patients in
   the sample) in incremental costs and 4,684 additional bed days over the
   4-year study period.
   CONCLUSIONS: In this surgical spine cohort, AEs accounted for 16\% of
   the total cost of in-hospital care. Higher severity AEs were
   progressively more costly on a per-case basis; however, the more
   frequent lower severity events (ie, Grade I and II) also had a
   substantial aggregate cost (43\%). These results suggest that a strong
   business case exists for patient safety strategies focused not only on
   severe AEs but also on the reduction of lower severity events that may
   be more amenable to prevention efforts. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Since the late 1990s, the use of nano zero valent iron (nZVI) for
   groundwater remediation has been investigated for its potential to
   reduce subsurface contaminants such as PCBs, chlorinated solvents, and
   heavy metals. nZVI shows tremendous promise in the environmental sector
   due to its high reactivity and as such, numerous laboratory and field
   studies have been performed to assess its effectiveness. This paper
   reviews the current knowledge of nZVI/bimetallic technology as it
   pertains to subsurface remediation of chlorinated solvents and heavy
   metals. The manuscript provides background on the technology,
   summarizing nZVI reactions with chlorinated solvents and metals, and
   examines the factors affecting nZVI reactivity. Studies on subsurface
   transport of bare and coated nZVI particles are also reviewed and
   challenges with field implementation are discussed. This manuscript
   offers a comprehensive review of nZVI technology and highlights the work
   still needed to optimize it for subsurface remediation. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{A 3-D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) scheme with controllable
   stability beyond the stability limit of FDTD is presented. The key to
   controlling the FDTD stability limit is a spatial filter applied to the
   electromagnetic field vectors in order to ensure that unstable spatial
   harmonics are eliminated. A significant advantage of this approach is
   the simplicity of its incorporation into existing FDTD codes. Moreover,
   this method is employed as a means to implement a late-time stable 3-D
   sub-gridding scheme. Applications include wave guide filters and the
   analysis of screens for near-field sub-wavelength focusing at microwave
   frequencies.}},

Abstract = {{The electronic structure of p(2 x 3) Ag films on Si(100) is studied by
   using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and scanning tunneling
   spectroscopy (STS). We observe three energy loss peaks with their loss
   energies around 1.28, 1.63, and 4.0 eV, respectively. They are assigned
   to the interband transition in the p(2x3) islands, the interface plasmon
   between Si(100) and Ag crystallites formed concomitantly with the p(2 x
   3) islands, and a combination of the surface plasmon and interband
   transition of the Ag crystallites, respectively. STS over the p(2 x 3)
   surface also reveals a band gap around 1 eV in good agreement with the
   EELS observation of the interband transition. The present observation of
   the band gap suggests that the p(2 x 3) surface is semiconducting.
   Furthermore, we examine two models previously proposed for the p(2 x 3)
   surface against the present experimental observation by ab initio band
   structure calculations.}},

Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Type III effectors are virulence factors of Gram-negative bacterial
   pathogens delivered directly into host cells by the type III secretion
   nanomachine where they manipulate host cell processes such as the innate
   immunity and gene expression. Here, we show that the novel type III
   effector XopL from the model plant pathogen Xanthomonas campestris pv.
   vesicatoria exhibits E3 ubiquitin ligase activity in vitro and in
   planta, induces plant cell death and subverts plant immunity. E3 ligase
   activity is associated with the C-terminal region of XopL, which
   specifically interacts with plant E2 ubiquitin conjugating enzymes and
   mediates formation of predominantly K11-linked polyubiquitin chains. The
   crystal structure of the XopL C-terminal domain revealed a single domain
   with a novel fold, termed XL-box, not present in any previously
   characterized E3 ligase. Mutation of amino acids in the central cavity
   of the XL-box disrupts E3 ligase activity and prevents XopL-induced
   plant cell death. The lack of cysteine residues in the XL-box suggests
   the absence of thioester-linked ubiquitin-E3 ligase intermediates and a
   non-catalytic mechanism for XopL-mediated ubiquitination. The crystal
   structure of the N-terminal region of XopL confirmed the presence of a
   leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, which may serve as a protein-protein
   interaction module for ubiquitination target recognition. While the E3
   ligase activity is required to provoke plant cell death, suppression of
   PAMP responses solely depends on the N-terminal LRR domain. Taken
   together, the unique structural fold of the E3 ubiquitin ligase domain
   within the Xanthomonas XopL is unprecedented and highlights the
   variation in bacterial pathogen effectors mimicking this
   eukaryote-specific activity.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF VACUUM SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY B}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Copper phthalocyanine-based organic thin-film transistors (OTFTs) with
   gate dielectric made by different combinations of ZrO2 and Al2O3 are
   fabricated. Experimental results show that as compared to the OTFTs with
   ZrO2/Al2O3 stacked and Al2O3/ZrO2/Al2O3 sandwiched gate dielectric, the
   device fabricated with the Al2O3/ZrO2 stacked gate dielectric manifests
   better electrical properties such as larger on/off ratio, smaller
   subthreshold slope, and higher carrier mobility. This could be explained
   by the fact that Al2O3 has good interface properties with CuPc and can
   act as a barrier layer, which prevents intermixing of materials at the
   organic/insulator interface and can slow oxygen diffusion through Al-O
   matrix, thus suppressing interfacial trap density. The gate-bias stress
   effect on the performance of OTFTs is also investigated. It is found
   that the threshold voltage shifts toward positive direction with stress
   time under a negative gate bias voltage. Longer stress times cause more
   degradation of the subthreshold and on/off ratio, probably due to more
   defect-state creation in the channel and an increase of interfacial
   traps and oxide charges in the dielectric during stress. Results also
   indicate that OTFTs with Al2O3 interlayer between the high-k dielectric
   and the gate electrode have less degradation in subthreshold and on/off
   ratio after a 3600-s stress. The involved mechanism lies in that the
   Al2O3 interlayer at the high-k dielectric/gate electrode interface can
   effectively block the injection of electrons from the gate electrode
   into the high-k material during electrical stress and thus less
   stress-induced interfacial traps and negative oxide charges in the
   devices. The electrical characteristics of the OTFTs after the removal
   of gate bias for a period of time are also studied. (C) 2013 American

Abstract = {{This paper models traffic at the individual vehicle level, estimates
   emissions from on-road vehicle sources accounting for drive cycles,
   estimates how those emissions are dispersed through the atmosphere; and
   finally estimates the exposed population at times of peak emissions. In
   the study area, the Toronto Waterfront Area, emissions are highest on
   the high capacity roadways, and higher in the peak direction of traffic.
   Pollutant concentrations are higher along the freeways. However,
   population exposure to these pollutants is highest in the central
   business district due to the higher population density. Evaluation of
   scenarios shows significant NOx and HC reduction of 12\% and 4\% when
   medium duty diesel trucks are converted to ultra-low emission vehicles.

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ulceration in carotid plaque is a risk indicator
   for ischemic stroke. Our aim was to compare plaque ulcer detection by
   standard TOF and CE-MRA techniques and to identify factors that
   influence its detection.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Carotid MR imaging scans were acquired on 2066
   participants in the ARIC study. We studied the 600 thickest plaques.
   TOF-MRA, CE-MRA, and black-blood MR images were analyzed together to
   define ulcer presence (plaque surface niche >= 2mm in depth). Sixty
   ulcerated arteries were detected. These arteries were randomly assigned,
   along with 40 nonulcerated plaques from the remaining 540, for
   evaluation of ulcer presence by 2 neuroradiologists. Associations
   between ulcer detection and ulcer characteristics, including
   orientation, location, and size, were determined and explored by CFD
   modeling.
   RESULTS: One CE-MRA and 3 TOF-MRAs were noninterpretable and excluded.
   Of 71 ulcers in 56 arteries, readers detected an average of 39 (55\%) on
   both TOF-MRA and CE-MRA, 26.5 (37.5\%) only on CE-MRA, and 1(1.5\%) only
   on TOF-MRA, missing 4.5 (6\%) ulcers by both methods. Ulcer detection by
   TOF-MRA was associated with its orientation (distally pointing versus
   perpendicular: OR = 5.57 {[}95\% CI, 1.08-28.65]; proximally pointing
   versus perpendicular: OR = 0.21 {[}95\% CI, 0.14-0.29]); location
   relative to point of maximum stenosis (distal versus isolevel: OR = 5.17
   {[}95\% CI, 2.10-12.70]); and neck-to-depth ratio (OR = 1.96 {[}95\% CI,
   1.11-3.45]) after controlling for stenosis and ulcer volume.
   CONCLUSIONS: CE-MRA detects more ulcers than TOF-MRA in carotid plaques.
   Missed ulcers on TOF-MRA are influenced by ulcer orientation, location
   relative to point of maximum stenosis, and neck-to-depth ratio.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring of sequestered carbon is essential to establishing the
   environmental safety and the efficacy of geological carbon
   sequestration. Sequestration in saline aquifers requires the detection
   of supercritical CO2 and CO2-saturated brine as distinct from the native
   reservoir brine. Here we demonstrate an all-optical approach to detect
   both supercritical CO2, and saturated brine under sequestration
   conditions. The method employs a long-period grating written on an
   optical fiber with a resonance wavelength that is sensitive to local
   refractive index within a pressure- and temperature-controlled apparatus
   at 40 degrees C and 1400 psi (9.65 MPa). The supercritical CO2 and brine
   are clearly distinguished by a wavelength shift of 1.149 nm (refractive
   index difference of 0.2371). The CO2-saturated brine is also detectable
   relative to brine, with a resonance wavelength shift of 0.192 nm
   (refractive index difference of 0.0396). Importantly, these findings
   indicate the potential for distributed, all-optical monitoring of CO2
   sequestration in saline aquifers.}},

Title = {{SO-MUM: A Coupled Atmospheric Transport and Multimedia Model Used to

Abstract = {{A spatially resolved, dynamic version of the Multimedia Urban Model
   (MUM) and the boundary layer forecast and air pollution transport model
   BLFMAPS were coupled to build Spatially Oriented MUM (SO-MUM), to
   estimate emissions and fate of POPs in an urban area on a 5 x 5 km(2)
   cell resolution. SO-MUM was used to back-calculate emissions from
   spatially resolved measured air concentrations of PCBs and PBDEs in
   Toronto, Canada. Estimated emissions of Sigma(38)PCBs were 230 (40-480)
   kg y(-1), 280 (50-580) g y(-1) km(-2), or 90 (16-190) mg y(-1)
   capita(-1), and Sigma 26PBDEs were 28 (6-63) kg y(-1), 34 (7-77) g y(-1)
   km(-2), or 11 (2-25) mg y(-1) capita(-1). A mass inventory of penta- and
   octa-BDEs in Toronto was estimated to be 200 tonnes (90-1000 tonnes) or
   80 (40-400) g capita(-1). Using this estimate and that of 440 (280-800)
   tonnes of PCBs, estimated emissions of Sigma(88)PCBs and Sigma 26PBDEs
   per mass of chemical inventory in Toronto were 0.5 (0.05-1.6) and 0.1
   (0.01-0.7) g(-1) y(-1) kg(-1), respectively. The results suggest annual
   emission rates of 0.04\% and 0.01\% from the mass inventories with
   downtown accounting for 30\% and 16\% of Toronto's chemical inventory
   and emissions of PCBs and PBDEs, respectively. Since total PBDE
   emissions are a function of mass inventory, which is proportional to
   building volume, we conclude that building volume can be used as a proxy
   to predict emissions. Per mass inventory emission rates were negatively
   related to vapor pressure within a compound class, but not consistently
   when considering all compound congeners.}},

Abstract = {{In this pilot study, we examined how effectively functional electrical
   stimulation (FES) and passive stepping mitigated orthostatic hypotension
   in participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). While being
   tilted head-up to 70 degrees from the supine position, the participants
   underwent four 10-min conditions in a random sequence: 1) no
   intervention, 2) passive stepping, 3) isometric FES of leg muscles, and
   4) FES of leg muscles combined with passive stepping. We found that FES
   and passive stepping independently mitigated a decrease in stroke volume
   and helped to maintain the mean blood pressure. The effects of FES on
   stroke volume and mean blood pressure were greater than those of passive
   stepping. When combined, FES and passive stepping did not interfere with
   each other, but they also did not synergistically increase stroke volume
   or mean blood pressure. Thus, the present study suggests that FES
   delivered to lower limbs can be used in individuals with SCI to help
   them withstand orthostatic stress. Additional studies are needed to
   confirm whether this use of FES is applicable to a larger population of
   individuals with SCI.}},

Abstract = {{Optimal nonblocking modular supervisory control of discrete-event
   systems is developed using state tree structures to manage state
   explosion. The total specification of the system to be controlled is
   decomposed into several sub-specifications, and a separate optimal
   (maximally permissive) nonblocking supervisor designed for each. Under
   an additional global nonblocking condition we directly obtain an optimal
   nonblocking modular state feedback control for the full system. If that
   condition fails, i.e. the modular controlled system is blocking, an
   additional coordinator is adjoined which renders the global controlled
   behaviour, both nonblocking and optimal.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: To compare multidirectional seated postural stability
   between individuals with spinal cord injury and able-bodied individuals
   and to evaluate the impact of abdominal and low back muscle paralysis on
   multidirectional seated stability.
   Design: Case-control study.
   Participants: Fifteen individuals with complete or incomplete spinal
   cord injury affecting various vertebral levels participated in this
   study and were gender-matched with 15 able-bodied individuals.
   Methods: Participants were instructed to lean as far as possible in 8
   directions, set apart by 45 intervals, while seated on an instrumented
   chair with their feet placed on force plates. Eight direction-specific
   stability indices and a global stability index were calculated.
   Results: The global stability index and all direction-specific indices,
   except in the anterior and posterior directions, were lower in
   individuals with spinal cord injury than in able-bodied individuals.
   However, the individuals with spinal cord injury who had partial or full
   control of their abdominal and lower trunk muscles obtained a similar
   global stability index and similar direction-specific indices compared
   to the able-bodied individuals.
   Conclusion: Multidirectional seated postural stability is reduced in
   individuals with SCI who have paralysis of the abdominal and lower back
   muscles in comparison to able-bodied individuals.}},

Abstract = {{Scaling, the formation of hard deposits, in green liquor handling
   systems is a persistent problem in many kraft pulp mills. Scaling is
   commonly believed to be a result of pirssonite (Na2CO3 center dot CaCO3
   center dot 2H(2)O) formation when the green liquor total titrateable
   alkali (TTA) is high. In this study, we characterized 12 scale samples
   obtained from 10 kraft pulp mills using various analytical methods,
   including TGA/DSC (thermogravimetric analysis/differential scanning
   calorimetry), XRF (X-ray fluorescence spectrometry), XRD (X-ray
   diffraction spectrometry), SEM (scanning electron microscopy), and EMPA
   (electron microprobe analyzer). The analysis identified only four of
   these samples as pirssonite; the remaining consisted mostly of calcite
   (CaCO3). The reason for the predominant presence of calcite in the
   majority of the scale samples is not known. It may be a result of
   selective dissolution of sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) from the pirssonite
   scale during the time when the green liquor total TTA was low, leaving
   the insoluble CaCO3 behind.}},

Abstract = {{Rehabilitation engineering is concerned with technology innovations and
   technology-mediated treatments for the improvement of quality of care
   and quality of life of individuals with disability. Unlike many other
   fields of health research, the knowledge translation (KT) cycle of
   rehabilitation engineering research and development (R\&D) is often
   considered incomplete until a technology product or
   technology-facilitated therapy is available to target clientele. As
   such, the KT journey of rehabilitation engineering R\&D is extremely
   challenging, necessarily involving knowledge exchange among numerous
   players across multiple sectors. In this article, we draw on recent
   literature about the knowledge trichotomy in technology-based
   rehabilitation R\&D and propose a knowledge ecosystem to frame the
   rehabilitation engineering KT process from need to product. Identifying
   the principal process of the ecosystem as one of knowledge flow, we
   elucidate the roles of repository and networked knowledge, identify key
   consumers and producers in a trinity of communities of practice, and
   draw on knowledge management literature to describe different knowledge
   flows. The article concludes with instantiations of this knowledge
   ecosystem for 2 local rehabilitation engineering

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The ankle extensors play a dominant role in controlling the equilibrium
   during bipedal quiet standing. Their primary role is to resist the
   gravity toppling torque that pulls the body forward. The purpose of this
   study was to investigate whether the continuous muscle activity of the
   anti-gravity muscles during standing is triggered by the joint torque
   requirement for opposing the gravity toppling torque, rather than by the
   vertical load on the lower limbs. Healthy adults subjects stood on a
   force plate. The ankle torque, ankle angle, and electromyograms from the
   right lower leg muscles were measured. A ground-fixed support device was
   used to support the subject at his/her knees, without changing the
   posture from the free standing one. During the supported condition,
   which eliminates the ankle torque requirement while maintaining both the
   vertical load on the lower limbs and the natural upright standing
   posture, the plantarflexor activity was attenuated to the resting level.
   Also, this attenuated plantarflexor activity was found only in one side
   when the ipsilateral leg was supported. Our results suggest that the
   vertical load on the lower limb is not determinant for inducing the
   continuous muscle activity in the anti-gravity muscles, but that it
   depends on the required joint torque to oppose the gravity toppling
   torque. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The surface properties of a family of elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs),
   differing in molecular weight and sequence length, were investigated to
   understand how the nature of the polypeptide film might contribute to
   their thrombogenic profile. Physical adsorption of the ELPs onto Mylar
   increased surface wettability as the sequence length decreased while
   X-ray spectroscopy analysis showed an increasing amide content with
   sequence length. Chemical force microscopy analysis revealed that the
   ELP-coated surfaces displayed purely hydrophilic adhesion forces that
   increased as the ELP sequence length decreased. Adsorption isotherms
   performed using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, showed
   that the surface coverage increased with ELP sequence length. The longer
   polypeptides (ELP2 and ELP4) also displayed higher specific dissipation
   values indicating that they established films with greater structural
   flexibility and associated water content than the shorter polypeptide,
   ELP1. Additionally, the stability of the ELP coating was lower with the
   shorter polypeptides. This study highlights the different surface
   properties of the ELP coatings as well as the dynamic nature of the ELP
   adsorbed layer wherein the conformational state may be an important
   factor contributing to their blood response.}},

   cellulolytic bacterium Clostridium thermocellum 27405. Using
   noninvasive, in situ fluorescence imaging, we showed biofilms capable of
   near complete substrate conversion with a characteristic monolayered
   cell structure without an extracellular polymeric matrix typically seen
   in biofilms. Cell division at the interface and terminal endospores
   appeared throughout all stages of biofilm growth. Using continuous-flow
   reactors with a rate of dilution (2 h(-1)) 12-fold higher than the
   bacterium's maximum growth rate, we compared biofilm activity under low
   (44 g/liter) and high (202 g/liter) initial cellulose loading. The
   average hydrolysis rate was over 3-fold higher in the latter case, while
   the proportions of oligomeric cellulose hydrolysis products lost from
   the biofilm were 13.7\% and 29.1\% of the total substrate carbon
   hydrolyzed, respectively. Fermentative catabolism was comparable between
   the two cellulose loadings, with ca. 4\% of metabolized sugar carbon
   being utilized for cell production, while 75.4\% and 66.7\% of the two
   cellulose loadings, respectively, were converted to primary carbon
   metabolites (ethanol, acetic acid, lactic acid, carbon dioxide).
   However, there was a notable difference in the ethanol-to-acetic acid
   ratio (g/g), measured to be 0.91 for the low cellulose loading and 0.41
   for the high cellulose loading. The results suggest that substrate
   availability for cell attachment rather than biofilm colonization rates
   govern the efficiency of cellulose conversion.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the loading and extent of CO2 uptake by various
   amines and their mixtures. A quantity of CO2 was introduced into a 292
   mL stainless steel batch reactor containing 10 mL amine solutions at a
   constant temperature, then the reactor was sealed, pressurized with a
   CO2 containing gas and the system pressure was recorded. The CO2
   absorption into the amines was recorded as a pressure decrease and used
   to calculate the amount and loading of CO2 in the amines. In particular,
   diethylenetriamine was found to be effective in enhancing the
   performance of other amines. Diethylenetriamine was added into aqueous
   monoethanolamine and methyldiethanolamine solutions and its effects were
   investigated. The results indicated that CO2 removal extent and
   absorption amount increased with aqueous amine solution concentration,
   while CO2 loading decrease with aqueous amine solution concentration.
   diethylenetriamine has a good absorption characteristic and adding a
   small quantity of diethylenetriamine was found to promote the absorption

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow users to control external devices

   automatically distinguish a mental arithmetic (MA) task from a natural
   baseline state in an individual with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)
   using signals acquired via multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy
   (NIRS). Using dual-wavelength NIRS, we interrogated nine sites around
   the frontopolar locations while the individual performed MA to answer
   multiple-choice questions within a system-paced paradigm. An encouraging
   overall classification accuracy of 71.1\% was obtained, which is
   comparable to the average accuracy we previously reported for healthy
   individuals performing the same task. This result demonstrates the

Abstract = {{This paper studies the capacity region of a K-user cyclicGaussian
   interference channel, where the user interferes with only the (k-1)th
   user (mod) in the network. Inspired by the work of Etkin, Tse, and Wang,
   who derived a capacity region outer bound for the two-user Gaussian
   interference channel and proved that a simple Han-Kobayashi
   power-splitting scheme can achieve to within one bit of the capacity
   region for all values of channel parameters, this paper shows that a
   similar strategy also achieves the capacity region of the K-user cyclic
   interference channel to within a constant gap in the weak interference
   regime. Specifically, for the K-user cyclic Gaussian interference
   channel, a compact representation of the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate
   region using Fourier-Motzkin elimination is first derived; a capacity
   region outer bound is then established. It is shown that the
   Etkin-Tse-Wang power-splitting strategy gives a constant gap of at most
   2 bits in the weak interference regime. For the special three-user case,
   this gap can be sharpened to bits by time-sharing of several different
   strategies. The capacity result of the K-user cyclic Gaussian
   interference channel in the strong interference regime is also given.
   Further, based on the capacity results, this paper studies the
   generalized degrees of freedom (GDoF) of the symmetric cyclic
   interference channel. It is shown that the GDoF of the symmetric
   capacity is the same as that of the classic two-user interference
   channel, no matter how many users are in the network.}},

Abstract = {{To improve rendered video quality and serve more receivers, peer-to-peer
   (P2P) video-on-demand streaming systems usually deploy seed servers.
   These servers complement the limited upload capacity offered by peers.
   In this paper, we are interested in optimally managing the capacity of
   seed servers, especially when scalable video streams are served to
   peers. Scalable video streams are encoded in multiple layers to support
   heterogeneous receivers. We show that the problem of optimally
   allocating the seeding capacity to serve scalable streams to peers is
   NP-complete. We then propose an approximation algorithm to solve it.
   Using the proposed allocation algorithm, we develop an analytical model
   to study the performance of P2P video-on-demand streaming systems and to
   manage their resources. The analysis also provides an upper bound on the
   maximum number of peers that can be admitted to the system in flash
   crowd scenarios. We validate our analysis by comparing its results to
   those obtained from simulations. Our analytical model can be used by
   administrators of P2P streaming systems to estimate the performance and

Abstract = {{Robust generation of pelvic finite element models is necessary to
   understand the variation in mechanical behaviour resulting from
   differences in gender, aging, disease and injury. The objective of this
   study was to apply and evaluate mesh morphing and mapping techniques to
   facilitate the creation and structural analysis of specimen-specific
   finite element (FE) models of the pelvis. A specimen-specific pelvic FE
   model (source?mesh) was generated following a traditional user-intensive
   meshing scheme. The source mesh was morphed onto a computed tomography
   scan generated target surface of a second pelvis using a
   landmarked-based approach, in which exterior source nodes were shifted
   to target surface vertices, while constrained along a normal. A second
   copy of the morphed model was further refined through mesh mapping, in
   which surface nodes of the initial morphed model were selected in
   patches and remapped onto the surfaces of the target model. Computed
   tomography intensity based material properties were assigned to each
   model. The source, target, morphed and mapped models were analyzed under
   axial compression using linear static FE analysis and their strain
   distributions evaluated. Morphing and mapping techniques were
   effectively applied to generate good quality geometrically complex
   specimen-specific pelvic FE models. Mapping significantly improved
   strain concurrence with the target pelvis FE model. Copyright (C) 2012

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The developed world faces major socioeconomic and medical
   challenges associated with motor vehicle accidents caused by risky
   driving. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of individuals
   using virtual reality driving simulators may provide an important
   research tool to assess driving safety, based on brain activity and
   behavior.
   Methods: A fMRI-compatible driving simulator was developed and evaluated
   in the context of straight driving, turning, and stopping in 16 young
   healthy adults.
   Results: Robust maps of brain activity were obtained, including
   activation of the primary motor cortex, cerebellum, visual cortex, and
   parietal lobe, with limited head motion (<1.5 mm deviation from mean
   head position in the superior/inferior direction in all subjects) and
   only minor correlations between head motion, steering, or braking
   behavior.
   Conclusions: These results are consistent with previous literature and
   suggest that with care, fMRI of simulated driving is a feasible
   undertaking. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

Abstract = {{Adult bone marrow (BM) erythrocyte colony-forming units (CFU-Es) are
   important cellular targets for the treatment of anemia and also for the
   manufacture of red blood cells (RBCs) ex vivo. We obtained quantitative
   biochemical measurements from single and small numbers of CFU-Es by
   isolating and analyzing c-Kit(+)CD71(high)Ter119(-) cells from adult
   mouse BM and this allowed us to identify two mechanisms that can be
   manipulated to increase RBC production. As expected, maximum RBC output
   was obtained when CFU-Es were stimulated with a combination of Stem Cell
   Factor (SCF) and Erythropoietin (EPO) mainly because SCF supports a
   transient CFU-E expansion and EPO promotes the survival and terminal
   differentiation of erythroid progenitors. However, we found that one of
   the main factors limiting the output in RBCs was that EPO induces a
   downregulation of c-Kit expression which limits the transient expansion
   of CFU-Es. In the presence of SCF, the EPO-mediated downregulation of
   c-Kit on CFU-Es is delayed but still significant. Moreover, treatment of
   CFU-Es with 1-Naphthyl PP1 could partially inhibit the downregulation of
   c-Kit induced by EPO, suggesting that this process is dependent on a Src
   family kinase, v-Src and/or c-Fyn. We also found that CFU-E survival and
   proliferation was dependent on the level of time-integrated
   extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activation in these cells, all of
   which could be significantly increased when SCF and EPO were combined
   with mouse fetal liver-derived factors. Taken together, these results
   suggest two novel molecular strategies to increase RBC production and
   regeneration.}},

Abstract = {{To determine the outward permeability of retina-choroid-sclera (RCS)
   layer for different ophthalmic drugs and to develop correlations between
   drug physicochemical properties and RCS permeability.
   A finite volume model was developed to simulate pharmacokinetics in the
   eye following drug administration by intravitreal injection. The RCS
   permeability was determined for 32 compounds by best fitting the drug
   concentration-time profile obtained by simulation with previously
   reported experimental data. Multiple linear regression was then used to
   develop correlations between best fit RCS permeability and drugs
   physicochemical properties.
   The RCS drug permeabilities had values that ranged over 3 x 10(-6) m/s.
   Regression analysis for hydrophilic compounds showed that more than 92\%
   of the variation in permeability values can be explained by correlative
   models of drug properties that include logarithm of the octanol-water
   partition coefficient (LogP), protein binding (PB), number of hydrogen
   bond acceptors (HBA), hydrogen bond donors (HBD), polar surface area
   (PSA) and dissociation constant (pKa) as independent variables.
   Regression analysis for lipophilic compounds showed that no significant
   correlation can be found between just physicochemical properties and RCS
   permeability.
   Using the RCS permeability obtained from this study for different drugs,
   one can predict pharmacokinetics of intravitreal drug delivery systems
   such as solid implants or colloidal systems. Furthermore, the developed
   correlations between RCS permeability and physicochemical properties of
   drugs are useful in early drug development by predicting RCS
   permeability and drug concentration in the vitreous without experimental
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Biofuels are of particular interest as they have the potential to reduce
   our dependence on petroleum-derived fuels and the levels of greenhouse
   gas emissions from transportation. 1-Hexanol is a promising renewable
   long chain alcohol that can be used in conventional fuel blends or as a
   cosolvent for biodiesel mixtures. However, the fundamental combustion
   properties of 1-hexanol have not been fully characterized in the
   literature. Thus, new experimental results, consisting of temperature
   and concentration profiles of stable species were obtained for the
   oxidation of 1-hexanol generated in an opposed-flow diffusion flame at
   0.101 MPa. This experimental data were compared to the predicted values
   of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism proposed in the literature to
   study the combustion of 1-hexanol. This mechanism consists of 361
   chemical species and 2687 chemical reactions (most of them reversible).
   Reaction pathway and sensitivity analyses were performed to interpret
   the results. In addition, improvements were investigated to optimize the
   proposed mechanism. (C) 2012 The Combustion Institute. Published by

Abstract = {{Conventional petroleum, Fischer-Tropsch (FT), and other alternative
   hydrocarbon fuels typically contain a high concentration of lightly
   methylated iso-alkanes. However, until recently little work has been
   done on this important class of hydrocarbon components. In order to
   better understand the combustion characteristics of real fuels, this
   study presents new experimental data for 3-methylheptane and
   2,5-dimethylhexane in counterflow diffusion flames. This new dataset
   includes flame ignition, extinction, and speciation profiles. The high
   temperature oxidation of these fuels has been modeled using an extended
   transport database and a high temperature skeletal chemical kinetic
   model. The skeletal model is generated from a detailed model reduced
   using the directed relation graph with expert knowledge (DRG-X)
   methodology. The proposed skeletal model contains sufficient chemical
   fidelity to accurately predict the experimental speciation data in
   flames. The predictions are compared to elucidate the effects of number
   and location of the methyl substitutions. The location is found to have
   little effect on ignition and extinction in these counterflow diffusion
   flames. However, increasing the number of methyl substitutions was found
   to inhibit ignition and promote extinction. Chemical kinetic modelling
   simulations were used to correlate a fuel's extinction propensity with
   its ability to populate the H radical concentration. Species composition
   measurements indicate that the location and number of methyl
   substitutions was found to particularly affect the amount and type of
   alkenes observed. Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion

Title = {{A numerical and experimental study of soot formation in a laminar coflow

Abstract = {{The present numerical and experimental study aims at enhancing the
   quantitative accuracy of soot formation predictions in atmospheric
   pressure, laminar, sooting, coflow diffusion flames of jet fuel,
   improving upon a previously published study that used a polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) nucleation based soot model. That model used
   a conventional acetylene-based PAH growth reaction scheme to calculate
   PAH concentrations in a Jet A-1 surrogate flame. Its results were
   compared to the experimental data for a real Jet A-1 flame. In the
   central region of the flame, that model, similar to many soot models in
   the literature, underpredicted soot concentration by more than one order
   of magnitude. The following improvements are made in the present work:
   (1) flame temperature and soot volume fraction profiles are
   experimentally measured in a flame using surrogate Jet A-1 rather than
   real Jet A-1, so that more direct comparisons can be made, (2) a novel
   reaction scheme for PAH growth (mechanism 2 in the present work), with a
   more comprehensive set of pathways for aromatic ring formation and
   growth, is used to model soot formation, and (3) the empirical soot
   surface growth parameter, a, is updated. The simulation data, using
   mechanism 2, are compared to the measurement results and another set of
   computational data, using the less detailed acetylene-based mechanism
   (mechanism 1). It is shown that only mechanism 2 can predict the correct
   order of magnitude of the centerline soot concentrations, reproducing
   them within a factor of one to five. Soot particles are shown to be
   exposed to similar temperatures and acetylene concentrations with both
   mechanisms. Hence, this improvement on the centerline is because of the
   enhanced PAH growth model, which produces higher levels of pyrene and
   increases the soot particle nucleation rate. (C) 2012 The Combustion

Abstract = {{Human umbilical cord perivascular cells (HUCPVCs) are a readily
   available source of mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) for cell therapy.
   We were interested in understanding how differences from human bone
   marrow (BM)derived MSCs might yield insights into MSC biology. We found
   that HUCPVCs exhibited increased telomerase activity and longer
   telomeres compared with BM-MSCs. We also observed enhanced expression of
   the pluripotency factors OCT4, SOX2, and NANOG in HUCPVCs. The
   methylation of OCT4 and NANOG promoters was similar in both cell types,
   indicating that differences in the expression of pluripotency factors
   between the MSCs were not associated with epigenetic changes. MSC
   methylation at these loci is greater than reported for embryonic stem
   cells but less than in dermal fibroblasts, suggesting that
   multipotentiality of MSCs is epigenetically restricted. These results
   are consistent with the notion that the MSC population (whether BM- or
   HUCPV-derived) exhibits higher proliferative capacity and contains more
   progenitor cells than do dermal fibroblasts. STEM CELLS 2013;31:215-220}},

Journal = {{CELLS TISSUES ORGANS}},

Volume = {{197}},

Abstract = {{After traumatic spinal cord injury, grossly injured blood vessels leak
   blood and fluid into the parenchyma, leading to a large cystic cavity.
   Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) can reduce immediate vasoconstriction
   of vessels in the tissue surrounding the primary injury and promote
   angiogenesis. A localized delivery system would both achieve restricted
   delivery of FGF2 to the spinal cord and limit possible systemic effects
   such as mitogenesis. To enhance the endogenous angiogenic response after
   spinal cord injury, FGF2 was encapsulated in poly(lactide-co-glycolide)
   (PLGA) nanoparticles which were embedded in a biopolymer blend of
   hyaluronan and methylcellulose (HAMC) and then injected into the
   intrathecal space. Treatment began immediately after a 26 g clip
   compression spinal cord injury in rats and consisted of intrathecal
   delivery of FGF2 from the HAMC/PLGA/FGF2 composite. Control animals
   received intrathecal HAMC loaded with blank nanoparticles, intrathecal
   HAMC alone or intrathecal artificial cerebrospinal fluid alone.
   Sustained and localized delivery of FGF2 from composite HAMC/PLGA/FGF2
   achieved higher blood vessel density in the dorsal horns 28 days
   post-injury, due to either greater angiogenesis near the epicenter of
   the injury or vasoprotection acutely after spinal cord injury.
   Importantly, delivery of FGF2 from composite HAMC/PLGA/FGF2 did not
   produce proliferative lesions that had been previously reported for FGF2
   delivered locally using a minipump/catheter. These results suggest that
   localized and sustained delivery with composite HAMC/PLGA/FGF2 is an
   excellent system to deliver biomolecules directly to the spinal cord,
   thereby circumventing the blood spinal cord barrier and avoiding
   systemic side effects. Copyright (C) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Sootblowers used to control deposit accumulation on boiler tubes consume
   substantial amounts of costly high pressure steam; this cost motivates
   the study of sootblowers and development of improved sootblowing
   strategies. This paper reviews recent research done on sootblowing at
   the University of Toronto on three fronts. First, the breakup behavior
   of brittle deposits impacted by a supersonic gas jet was experimentally
   studied. Results reveal that crack formation is vital to deposit
   breakup: to effectively break a deposit, the jet must drill into the
   deposit and crack it in the short time that the deposit is exposed to
   the jet. Second, the interactions between a supersonic jet and various
   tube geometries were visualized to understand sootblower jet flow
   between boiler tube bundles. Images show that sootblower jet flow and
   penetration between platens is strongly affected by any interaction
   between the jet and the first tube of the platen. Finally, a CFD model
   of a turbulent supersonic sootblower jet was developed. The model yields
   results that are in good agreement with available laboratory and in situ
   sootblower measurements. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we follow the pore-level simulation approach to
   investigate fluid flow over an open-porous interface using the lattice

   treatment for the interface, the predicted pore-level velocity field is
   averaged and used to evaluate the available macroscopic boundary
   conditions for the interface. Two most common interface boundary
   conditions are evaluated, and the unknown fitting parameters in them are
   calculated as a function of porosity of the porous region. Analytical
   solutions of the velocity profile in the close vicinity of the interface
   are used to validate the numerical methodology. It is shown that the
   predicted numerical results for penetration depth in the porous region,
   flow rate in open channel, and velocity profile in the open and porous
   regions are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the two
   available models, if the proposed values of their fitting parameters are

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new facial expression recognition (FER) which
   exploits the effectiveness of color information and sparse
   representation. For extracting face feature, we compute color vector
   differences between color pixels so that they can effectively capture
   change of face appearance (e.g., skin texture). Through comparative and
   extensive experiment using two public FER databases (DBs), we validate
   that our color texture features are suited to the sparse representation
   for improving FER accuracy. Specifically, our color texture features can
   considerably improve the recognition accuracy obtained by sparse
   representation compared with other features (e.g., Local Binary Pattern
   (LBP)) under realistic recognition conditions (e.g., low-resolution
   faces). It is also shown that the use of our features can yield high
   discrimination capability and sparsity, justifying the high recognition
   accuracies obtained. Further, the proposed FER outperforms five other
   state-of-the-art FER methods.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the extent to which the bit-level representation of
   variables can be used to optimize hardware generated by high-level
   synthesis (HLS). Two approaches to bit-level optimization are considered
   (individually and together): 1) range analysis, and 2) bitmask analysis.
   Range analysis aims to predetermine min/max ranges for variables to
   reduce the bitwidth required to represent variables in hardware. Bitmask
   analysis characterizes individual bits within a word as either constants
   (1 or 0), sign bits, or unknowns, where constants/don't-cares permit
   hardware to be eliminated under certain conditions. Static
   compiler-based analysis is contrasted with dynamic profiling-based
   analysis in terms of their potential to impact area and speed of
   HLS-generated hardware. For a set of benchmarks implemented in the
   Altera Cyclone II FPGA, results show bit-level optimizations in HLS
   based on static analysis reduce circuit area by 9\%, on average, while
   additional optimizations based on dynamic analysis provide 34\% area
   reduction.}},

Abstract = {{Integrating networks-on-chip (NoCs) on FPGAs can improve device
   scalability and facilitate design by abstracting communication and
   simplifying timing closure, not only between modules in the FPGA fabric
   but also with large ``hard{''} blocks such as high-speed I/O interfaces.
   We propose mixed and hard NoCs that add less than 1\% area to large
   FPGAs and run 5-6x faster than the soft NoC equivalent. A detailed power
   analysis, per NoC component, shows that routers consume 14x less power
   when implemented hard compared to soft, and whether hard or soft most of
   the router's power is consumed in the input modules for buffering. For
   complete systems, hard NoCs consume less than 6\% (and as low as 3\%) of
   the FPGA's dynamic power budget to support 100 GB/s of communication
   bandwidth. We find that, depending on design choices, hard NoCs consume
   4.5-10.4 mJ of energy per GB of data transferred. Surprisingly, this is
   comparable to the energy efficiency of the simplest traditional
   interconnect on an FPGA - soft point-to-point links require 4.7 mJ/GB.
   In many designs, communication must include multiplexing, arbitration
   and/or pipelining. For all these cases, our results indicate that a hard
   NoC will be more energy efficient than the conventional FPGA fabric.}},

Abstract = {{A major issue facing the widespread use of FPGAs as accelerators is
   their programmability wall: the difficulty of hardware design and the
   long synthesis times. Overlays-presynthesized FPGA circuits that are
   themselves reconfigurable-promise to tackle these challenges. We design
   and evaluate an overlay architecture, structured as a mesh of functional
   units, for pipelined execution of data-flow graphs (DFGs), a common
   abstraction for expressing parallelism in applications. We use
   data-driven execution based on elastic pipelines to balance pipeline
   latencies and achieve a high integral MAX, scalability and maximum
   throughput. We prototype two overlays on a Stratix IV FPGA: a 355 MHz
   24x16 integer overlay and a 312 MHz 18x16 floating-point overlay. We
   also design a tool that maps DFGs to overlays. We map 15 DFGs and show
   that the two overlays deliver throughputs of up to 35 GOPS and 22
   GFLOPS, respectively. We also show that DFG mapping is fast, taking no
   more than 6 seconds for the largest DFG. Thus, our overlay architecture
   raises the level of abstraction of FPGA programming closer to that of
   software and avoids lengthy synthesis time, easing the use of these
   devices to accelerate applications.}},

Abstract = {{Pass-transistors have been the key building block for field-programmable
   gate array (FPGA) circuitry for many years due to the very small switch
   they enable. However, pass-transistor performance and reliability have
   been degrading with technology scaling. Transmission gates are an
   alternative to pass-transistors; while larger, they are more robust. We
   develop a new FPGA circuit optimization flow and use it to investigate
   the area, delay and power impact of building FPGAs out of transmission
   gates instead of pass-transistors in a 22nm process. Our results show
   that transmission gate FPGAs are 15\% larger than pass-transistor FPGAs
   but are 10-25\% faster depending on the allowable level of ``gate
   boosting{''}. Without gate boosting, transmission gate FPGAs are the
   better option with 14\% lower area-delay product. If 200mV of gate
   boosting is possible however, pass-transistor FPGAs remain the slightly
   better choice with a 2\% better area-delay product. We also show that
   transmission gates with a separate power supply for their gate terminal
   enable a low-voltage FPGA with 50\% less power and good delay.}},

Abstract = {{Benchmarks play a key role in FPGA architecture and CAD research,
   enabling the quantitative comparison of tools and architectures. It is
   important that these benchmarks reflect modern designs which are large
   scale systems that make use of heterogeneous resources; however, most
   current FPGA benchmarks are both small and simple. In this paper we
   present Titan, a hybrid CAD flow that addresses these issues. The flow
   uses Altera's Quartus II FPGA CAD software to perform HDL synthesis and
   a conversion tool to translate the result into the academic BLIF format.
   Using this flow we created the Titan23 benchmark set, which consists of
   23 large (90K-1.8M block) benchmark circuits covering a wide range of
   application domains. Using the Titan23 benchmarks and a detailed model
   of Altera's Stratix IV architecture we compared the performance and
   quality of VPR and Quartus II targeting the same architecture. We found
   that VPR is at least 2.7 x slower, uses 5.1 x more memory and 2.6 x more
   wire compared to Quartus II. Finally, we identified that VPR's focus on
   achieving a dense packing is responsible for a large portion of the wire
   length gap.}},

Abstract = {{This work studies branch predictor implementations for general purpose,
   pipelined, single core soft processors. It shows that the existing
   designs do not map well onto reconfigurable hardware since they were
   optimized for custom logic implementation. This work then proposes an
   accurate and fast branch predictor that uses few resources on FPGAs. The
   proposed predictor uses: (1) an FPGA-friendly pattern based direction
   predictor, (2) a return address stack, (3) in-fetch target address
   calculation instead of a branch target buffer, and (4) instruction
   pre-decoding. Experimental measurements using a subset of the
   SPECCPU2006 workloads show that the presented FPGA-friendly branch
   predictor delivers high performance while operating at approximately 259
   MHz using only 147 ALUTs and one BRAM on an Altera Stratix IV FPGA.}},

   expectations.
   This paper first details the design of the RPDC activity, and then
   examines the administration and logistics, assessment, student
   engagement and learning, and student response to this highly accelerated
   product design cycle. The examination of the activity pays specific
   attention to the challenges posed by a high frequency of cognitive

   which guided reflection and feedback can be provided based on visible
   behaviour competencies as a means to engage students in learning about
   and improving their individual team-effectiveness. An initial version of
   the TEI was developed with three aspects (organizational, relational and
   communication) and 27 competencies. This TEI was studied through
   responses collected in a first year engineering design class of 250
   students in Winter 2012. Correlation analysis was applied to student
   assessments and combined with the qualitative analyses of survey and
   focus group feedback from the teaching assistants and students to
   develop an understanding of how students perceive and use the inventory.
   Based on this analysis, the 27 competencies were reduced to 18. Student
   perceptions of the inventory as well as details of the modifications
   made to the TEI are presented herein.}},

Abstract = {{For the past six years, the University of Toronto has been offering a
   training program for senior year Ph.D. Candidates in Engineering as they
   prepare for life after graduation. Specifically, the Prospective
   Professors in Training (PPIT) Program offers a year-long curriculum that
   includes seminars, activities and a theoretical course aimed to promote
   teaching and research excellence for individuals seeking to become
   engineering educators. For the seminar component of PPIT, students
   interact with current professors and experts from a variety of
   engineering disciplines on topics pertaining to: the interview process,
   acquiring funding, developing a research program, building a research
   team, the tenure process, and other topics. For the course component,
   the students examine the fundamentals of engineering teaching in terms
   of theory and practice for a period of 12-weeks. The course introduces
   elements of learning theories, engineering pedagogy and accessible
   instruction, and challenges students to develop a teaching philosophy
   and an academic dossier - both of which are reviewed by current faculty
   with constructive feedback provided to the students.
   The study examines the PPIT program over a six-year period and attempts
   to understand areas of strengths and potential improvement. This paper
   introduces the PPIT program and its importance to student development,
   to understand the impact of the PPIT program on the professional
   development of the students. Specifically, each student was asked to
   complete a questionnaire before and after the PPIT program and we
   investigate this information for the purposes of improving PPIT and
   similar courses at other institutions. As we develop the course for next
   year, this study provides a framework that can assist in the development
   and improvement of similar programs in other institutions going forward.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents preliminary studies in developing a fuzzy logic

   rehabilitation exercise. The intelligent system autonomously varies
   control parameters to generate different haptic effects on the robotic
   device. The robotic device is able to apply both resistive and assistive
   forces for guiding the patient during the exercise. The fuzzy logic
   based decision-making system estimates muscle fatigue of the patient
   using exercise performance and generates a combination of resistive and
   assistive forces so that the stroke survivor can exercise for longer
   durations with increasing control. The fuzzy logic based system is
   initially developed using a study with healthy subjects and preliminary
   results are also presented to validate the developed system with healthy
   subjects. The next stage of this work will collect data from stroke
   survivors for further development of the system.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, datacenter carbon emission has become an emerging concern for
   the cloud service providers. Previous works are limited on cutting down
   the power consumption of the datacenters to defuse such a concern. In
   this paper, we show how the spatial and temporal variabilities of the
   electricity carbon footprint can be fully exploited to further green the
   cloud running on top of geographically distributed datacenters. We
   jointly consider the electricity cost, service level agreement (SLA)
   requirement, and emission reduction budget. To navigate such a three-way
   tradeoff, we take advantage of Lyapunov optimization techniques to
   design and analyze a carbon-aware control framework, which makes online
   decisions on geographical load balancing, capacity right-sizing, and
   server speed scaling. Results from rigorous mathematical analyses and
   real-world trace-driven empirical evaluation demonstrate its
   effectiveness in both minimizing electricity cost and reducing carbon
   emission.}},

Abstract = {{GPUs are used to speed up many scientific computations; however, to use
   several networked GPUs concurrently, the programmer must explicitly
   partition work and transmit data between devices. We propose DistCL, a
   novel framework that distributes the execution of OpenCL kernels across
   a GPU cluster. DistCL makes multiple distributed compute devices appear
   to be a single compute device. DistCL abstracts and manages many of the
   challenges associated with distributing a kernel across multiple devices
   including: (1) partitioning work into smaller parts, (2) scheduling
   these parts across the network, (3) partitioning memory so that each
   part of memory is written to by at most one device, and (4) tracking and
   transferring these parts of memory. Converting an OpenCL application to
   DistCL is straightforward and requires little programmer effort. This
   makes it a powerful and valuable tool for exploring the distributed
   execution of OpenCL kernels. We compare DistCL to SnuCL, which also
   facilitates the distribution of OpenCL kernels. We also give some
   insights: distributed tasks favor more compute bound problems and favour
   large contiguous memory accesses. DistCL achieves a maximum speedup of
   29.1 and average speedups of 7.3 when distributing kernels among 32
   peers over an Infiniband cluster.}},

Abstract = {{The great potential of multi-cell processing in Coordinated Multi-point
   (CoMP) transmission is hindered by the limited bandwidth of the backhaul
   network. In this paper, we tackle this problem from two perspectives.
   First, we provide a thorough analytical study of the expected capacity
   when employing zero forcing (ZF) beamforming based on quantized channel
   state information (CSI). We derive simple yet accurate expression for
   the average capacity per user when Zero-forcing precoders are employed.
   Then, we propose a low-complexity algorithm to share the backhaul
   bandwidth between the different users in a fair manner. The algorithm
   does water-filling for the backhaul bandwidth among users based on their
   signal-to-interference ratio (SIR), with a target of Equal SIR for all
   users. We analytically prove that the proposed algorithm is more fair
   than the standard techniques for backhaul sharing. Simulation results
   are provided to asses the analytical findings about the superiority of
   our algorithm in terms of both fairness and sum rate.}},

Abstract = {{Reliable multi-hop forwarding in vehicular networks is required by many
   critical Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) safety applications.
   Cooperative vehicular multi-hop schemes achieve reliability using
   broadcast transmissions and multiple forwarding relays at each hop.
   However, packet duplication must be controlled to circumvent the
   broadcast storm problem. This paper proposes the Cooperative POCbased
   Forwarding (CPF) protocol, which extends the repetition-based POC-MAC
   protocol to handle multi-hop transmissions. Multiple cooperating relays
   at each forwarding hop schedule their transmissions to correspond to a
   single POC codeword. The transmission adhere to the transmission
   patterns of the POC-MAC. The proposed scheme exploits spatial diversity
   while mitigating the effect of hidden terminals on broadcast
   transmissions. By allocating separate POC-based schedules for multi-hop
   packets and the periodic broadcast of safety heartbeat packets, the CPF
   protocol reduces the interference between the two. A Markov model is
   presented for the end-to-end probability of reception of multi-hop
   packets. The performance of the CPF protocol is compared with other
   multi-hop schemes through ns-2 simulations.}},

   cognitive radio capabilities of small cells are required to improve the
   suboptimal spectrum utilization at small cells. However, care must be
   taken to ensure that interference from autonomously deployed small cells
   is tightly controlled when developing such policies. This paper presents
   a dynamic spectrum access framework that enables small cells employing a
   specific Radio Access Technology (RAT) to access the spectrum allocated
   to other RATs as secondary users without degrading the performance of
   primary RATs. Secondary small cells opportunistically access unutilized
   spectrum in their coverage area and the protection of primary RATs is
   achieved by preventing secondary small cells from accessing spectrum
   when a potential interference scenario is detected. A system where HSPA
   and LTE-Advanced are co-deployed is considered. Simulation results show
   that substantial performance gains for both RATs are achieved by
   increasing spectrum utilization through secondary access for small
   cells. Furthermore, gains are achieved without degrading the performance
   of primary RATs.}},

   possible to find a closed virtual holonomic constraint defined in an
   arbitrarily small neighborhood of the reference configuration, which is
   controlled invariant and stabilizable. We present a constructive proof
   that provides a method for the numerical computation of the constraint.

Abstract = {{This paper concerns stabilizability of a multichannel linear
   time-invariant (LTI) system with delay in inputs and outputs by means of
   a finite-dimensional decentralized output feedback controller. This
   problem can be tackled by obtaining the set of unstable decentralized
   fixed modes (DFMs) of the system. Although the set of DFMs for LTI
   time-delay systems is generally delay-dependent, there exists a certain
   type of DFMs, which are delay-independent. In this work, the notion of
   delay-independent DFM (DIDFM) is defined, and algebraic conditions are
   provided under which a mode of a multi-channel LTI system subject to
   input and output delays is a DIDFM. The result of this paper is more
   general than that of {[}1], due to the fact that that all the modes of

Abstract = {{We consider a collection of flexible loads. Each load is modeled as
   requiring energy E on a service interval {[}a,d] at a maximum rate of m.
   The collection is serviced by available generation g(t) which must be
   allocated causally to the various tasks. Our objective is to
   characterize the aggregate flexibility offered by this collection. In
   the absence of rate limits, we offer necessary and sufficient conditions
   for the generation g(t) to service the loads under causal scheduling
   without surplus or deficit. Our results show that the flexibility in the
   collection can be modeled as electricity storage. The capacity Q(t) and
   maximum charge/discharge rate m(t) of the equivalent storage can be
   computed in real time. Ex ante, these parameters must be estimated based
   on arrival/departure statistics and charging needs. Thus, the collection
   is equivalent a stochastic time-varying electricity storage. We next
   consider the case with charging rate limits. Here, we offer bounds on
   the capacity and rate of the equivalent electricity storage. We offer
   synthetic examples to illustrate our results.}},

Abstract = {{Uncertainty is an intrinsic aspect of demand response because electrical
   loads are subject to many random factors and their capabilities are
   often not directly measurable until they have been deployed. Demand
   response algorithms must therefore balance utilizing well-characterized,
   good loads and learning about poorly characterized but potentially good
   loads; this is a manifestation of the classical tradeoff between
   exploration and exploitation.
   We address this tradeoff in a restless bandit framework, a
   generalization of the well-known multi-armed bandit problem. The
   formulation yields index policies, in which loads are ranked by a scalar
   index and those with the highest are deployed. The policy is
   particularly appropriate for demand response because the indices have
   explicit analytical expressions that may be evaluated separately for
   each load, making them both simple and scalable.
   We numerically evaluate the performance of the index policy, and discuss
   implications of the policies in demand response.}},

Abstract = {{We identify a new observability concept, called relative observability,

   observation. A fixed, ambient language is given, relative to which
   observability is tested. Relative observability is stronger than
   observability, but enjoys the important property that it is preserved
   under set union; hence there exists the supremal relatively observable
   sublanguage of a given language. Relative observability is weaker than
   normality, and thus yields, when combined with controllability, a
   generally larger controlled behavior; in particular, no constraint is
   imposed that only observable controllable events may be disabled. We
   present algorithms which compute the supremal relatively observable (and
   controllable) sublanguage of a given language, which is generally larger
   than the normal counterparts. We demonstrate the new observability
   concept and algorithms with a Guideway example.}},

Abstract = {{Organizations need to accurately understand the skills and competencies
   of their human resources in order to effectively respond to internal and
   external demands for expertise and make informed hiring decisions. In
   recent years, however, human resources have become highly mobile, making
   it more difficult for organizations to accurately learn their
   competencies. In such environment, organizations need to rely
   significantly on third parties to provide them with useful information
   about individuals. These sources and the information they provide,
   however, vary in degrees of trust and validity. In a previous paper, we
   developed an ontology for skills and competencies and modeled and
   analyzed the various sources of information used to derive the belief in
   an individual's level of competency. In this paper, we present an
   approach based on social network analysis for identifying unreliable
   sources of competency information. We explore the conditions under which
   evaluations given by an individual or a group about another can be
   trusted. We evaluate this approach using recommendation data gathered by
   crawling user profiles in LinkedIn.}},

Abstract = {{ADC-based receivers use an ADC in the front end to convert the incoming
   signal to digital where significant equalization can be done in digital
   domain. These receivers can be classified as phase-tracking and blind
   architectures. In the former, the VCO phase is controlled through a
   feedback loop so as to sample the received data in the middle of the
   data eye. In the latter, the received signal is sampled with a blind
   clock, i.e. not in a loop, and the data at the center is obtained by
   data processing techniques such as data interpolation and extrapolation.
   This paper compares the two architectures in terms of their design
   complexity and cost, and derives equations that relate the required ADC
   resolution to channel loss and to the characteristics of the FFE/DFE
   that follow the ADC.}},

Abstract = {{Thanks to the ``on-demand{''} nature of cloud computing, a large number
   of applications have been recently migrated to the cloud. To take full
   advantage of superior connectivities between geo-distributed
   datacenters, application traffic can be ``ferried{''} through the cloud
   to provide better service and user experience. However, implementing and
   deploying such inter-datacenter protocols for various applications, such
   as messaging, streaming and conferencing, are not without challenges,
   due to complex requirements of applications and unique characteristics
   of datacenters. In order to simplify the design and implementation of
   new inter-datacenter protocols, we design and implement a new system
   framework, called Bellini, in this paper. Bellini provides customizable
   elements shared by the new category of inter-datacenter protocols,
   including a variety of transport protocols, routing policies, and rate
   allocation strategies. Bellini is also optimized to perform well in
   virtual machines, utilizing available resources efficiently. With case
   studies on video conferencing and messaging, we demonstrate the benefits
   of Bellini when it comes to designing and evaluating new
   inter-datacenter protocols to serve the needs of cloud-based

Abstract = {{This paper considers a downlink multicell cooperation model in which the
   base-stations (BSs) are connected to a central processor (CP) via
   rate-limited backhaul links. A user-centric clustering model is adopted
   where each scheduled user is cooperatively served by a cluster of BSs,
   and the serving BSs for different users may overlap. This paper
   formulates an optimal joint clustering and beamforming design problem in
   which each user dynamically forms a sparse network-wide beamforming
   vector whose non-zero entries correspond to the serving BSs.
   Specifically, we assume a fixed signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio
   (SINR) constraint for each user, and investigate the optimal tradeoff
   between the sum transmit power and the sum backhaul capacity needed to
   form the cooperating clusters. Intuitively, larger cooperation size
   leads to lower transmit power, because interference can be mitigated
   through cooperation, but it also leads to higher sum backhaul, because
   user data needs to be made available to more BSs. Motivated by the
   compressive sensing literature, this paper formulates the sparse
   beamforming problem as an l(0)-norm optimization problem, then uses the
   iterative reweighted l(1) heuristic to find a solution. A key
   observation of this paper is that the reweighting can be done on the
   l(2)-norm square of the beamformers (i.e., the power) at the BSs. This
   gives rise to a weighted power minimization problem over the entire
   network, which can be solved using the uplink-downlink duality technique
   with low computational complexity. This paper further proposes judicious
   choice of the weights, and shows that the new algorithm can provide a
   better tradeoff between the sum power and the sum backhaul capacity in
   the high SINR regime than previous algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we investigate the benefit of base station (BS)

   Our figure of merit is the required BS density required to meet a chosen

   hexagonal lattice in which path loss, lognormal shadowing and Rayleigh
   fading affect the signal received from users. Accurate closed-form
   expressions are first presented for the sum-rate coverage probability
   and ergodic sum-rate at each point of the cooperation region. Then, for
   a chosen quality of user rate, the required density of BS is derived
   based on the minimum value of rate coverage probability in the
   cooperation region. The approach guarantees that the achievable rate in
   the entire coverage region is above a target rate with chosen
   probability. The formulation allows comparison between different orders
   of BS cooperation, quantifying the reduced required BS density from
   higher orders of cooperation.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers the joint optimization of frequency reuse and
   base-station (BS) bias for user association in downlink heterogeneous
   networks for load balancing and inter-cell interference management. To
   make the analysis tractable, we assume that BSs are randomly deployed as
   point processes in multiple tiers, where BSs in each tier have different
   transmission powers and spatial densities. A utility maximization
   framework is formulated based on the user coverage rate, which is a
   function of the different BS biases for user association and different
   frequency reuse factors across BS tiers. Compared to previous works
   where the bias levels are heuristically determined and full reuse is
   adopted, we quantitatively compute the optimal user association bias and
   obtain the closed-form solution of the optimal frequency reuse.
   Interestingly, we find that the optimal bias and the optimal reuse
   factor of each BS tier have an inversely proportional relationship.
   Further, we also propose an iterative method for optimizing these two
   factors. In contrast to systemlevel optimization solutions based on
   specific channel realization and network topology, our approach is
   off-line and is useful for deriving deployment insights. Numerical
   results show that optimizing user association and frequency reuse for
   multi-tier heterogeneous networks can effectively improve cell-edge user
   rate performance and utility.}},

   sensors. Obtaining a single representation of the cardiac cycle from
   these three modalities requires data-level fusion. In the proposed
   method, we introduce a new heart-rate measurement enhancement method
   based on the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD).
   To measure the performance of the proposed method, we collected data on
   56 subjects. Our experimental results show that the Root Mean Square
   Error (as compared to the result from a pulse oximeter) from our
   proposed method is 3.6 which provides better performance than
   traditional filtering in terms of noise reduction. Furthermore, this
   fused result is more accurate than any single modality.}},

Abstract = {{A feedback-voltage-sensing translator for floating buck DC-DC converter
   is designed for CSMC's 0.5 mu m 60 V BCD process. The proposed circuit
   utilizes one NPN, one PNP and a resistor to translate a V-in-referenced
   (input voltage as the reference, instead of GND) feedback voltage to a
   current, which is then translated to a ground-referenced voltage with
   another two bipolar transistors and one resistor. High precision
   translation is accomplished based on the equivalent base-emitter
   voltages of the bipolar transistors. Simulation results show that, for a
   V-in-referenced feedback voltage of V-tb = V-in - V-n, the proposed
   translator generates a ground-referenced voltage of V-n with a variation
   of only 0.6 mV over a wide range of V-in from 18 to 60 V. The translator
   also achieves a low temperature coefficient of 6.9 ppm/degrees C from
   -40 to 125 degrees C. Additionally, the noise of this translator is only
   3.46 mu V-rms from 0.1 to 10 Hz and the PSR is -98 dB @ DC. The
   translator is verified via Spectre simulation in a floating buck
   converter.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the ergodic capacity of a multicell distributed
   antenna system (DAS), where remote antenna ports are spread within each
   cell to cooperatively transmit to user terminals. Unlike most prior
   studies which assume the antenna ports to be deployed at fixed
   locations, this paper assumes the antenna ports to be distributed as a
   spatial Poisson point process (PPP) to account for the fact that in
   practice the antenna ports are randomly placed to cover wherever the
   dead spots are. We first model DAS within each cell as a downlink
   multiple-input single-output (MISO) channel with per-antenna power
   constraint while accounting for inter-cell (inter-cluster) interference.
   Two DAS layouts are considered: the ``regular{''} layout where the
   antenna ports are randomly deployed within regular cellular boundary to
   serve a given user, and the ``user-centric{''} layout where the antenna
   ports are distributed over a wide area and the users choose the
   surrounding antenna ports to form a ``virtual cell{''} as its own
   serving antenna subset. Using the tool of stochastic geometry, we
   analytically derive efficiently computable ergodic capacity expressions
   for the two layouts of DAS. Using these expressions, the cell-edge
   capacity of DAS under the regular layout is shown to be upper-bounded by
   alpha/2, where a is the pathloss exponent. Numerical results show that
   the proposed analytical model can accurately model the first layout, and
   can well approximate the second layout when the serving radius of users
   is not large. Compared to the traditional cellular system where all
   antennas are co-located at the cell center, DAS has better cell-edge
   performance. Further, the user-centric DAS has higher capacity than the
   DAS under regular layout.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we address the problem of robust network design.
   Robustness is defined as the minimizing variations in network
   performance, such as average delay and throughput, due to the
   perturbations in the network, e.g. topology, demand and community of
   interest. We pose an optimization problem is cast in the form of
   minimizing a new robustness metric that is a function of network
   routing, capacities and external traffic demand distributions. We use
   the correspondence between packet flows in a network and random walk
   models. We use Markov chain sensitivity analysis to derive a new measure
   and prove its robustness property. We show that the node robustness
   factor, along with the Kemeny constant, plays a critical role in the
   robustness of a network. We evaluate the proposed robust optimization
   method by comparing to conventional network design approaches.}},

Abstract = {{The indictments, trials, and guilty verdicts for scientists and public
   officials tasked with assessing the risk of earthquakes for the L'Aquila
   region prior to the 2009 quake challenge many of the assumptions
   underlying current theories of risk and public scientific communication:
   this paper explores its potential impact, proposing an alternative to
   the most common prognostications. Although scientific bodies have warned
   of the ``chilling effect{''} the verdicts may have on real scientists
   engaging in dialogue with the public and public agencies in the
   management of risk, the possible impacts are much more complex. In fact,
   the replacement of responsibility with culpability may result in a freer
   flow of information to the public, which both presents opportunities and
   challenges to risk management. Such freedom of information, especially
   if accompanied by a lack of willingness on the part of scientists to
   engage in the conversation, will force a reconsideration of conventional
   models of popular science communication, roles of specific agents in the
   process, and ultimately, the goals of risk communication altogether. In
   this scenario, the concept of providing the right advice for an
   uninformed public ignorant of the data underlying the situation needs
   give way to a more participatory model for risk communication, one that
   is audience aware and necessarily acknowledges the probabilistic, rather
   than deterministic, nature of the predictive sciences.}},

Abstract = {{Instruction in engineering communication, especially for students for
   whom English is an additional language, is often based on assumptions
   that the relationship between knowledge about language and the ability
   to use language is one of cause and effect. However, this perspective
   does not adequately encompass the complex, multidisciplinary nature of
   teaching, learning and practicing engineering communication. Partly in
   response to this dilemma I propose two concepts, agility and efficacy,
   for consideration in researching and teaching engineering communication.
   The concepts emerged from current conceptualizations of language as a
   distributed activity with a focus on the strategies, norms, perceptions,
   and material and symbolic means used to establish shared understanding
   and shared goals. Approaching this dilemma from an activity theory
   perspective provides an opportunity to take advantage of this
   multidisciplinary nature, especially with a consideration of shared
   objects. Activity theory is introduced through examples of engineering
   communication education and a multidisciplinary research project is
   proposed to identify the contradictions and conflicts that make
   teaching, learning and practicing engineering communication so
   challenging.}},

Abstract = {{In 2010, the Engineering Communication Program (ECP) teamed up with
   Engineering Strategic Communication to find a visual way to resolve
   ECP's identity issues. We wanted to integrate the university and our
   Faculty's recently developed ``brand{''} in order to represent ourselves
   visibly as part of the engineering world, and so developed a type
   treatment of our name, and an insignia that introduced an acronym for
   communication instructors - MyCI. It was intended to resolve the
   confusion between TAs and Communication Instructors by introducing a
   mnemonic, an easy to say, easy to remember counterpart to the acronym
   for Teaching Assistant, while reinforcing the idea that developing a
   relationship with a Communication Instructor helps the learning process.
   We are investigating student response to the insignia before beginning
   work with their CIs, and as they become more familiar with the program.
   Our study consists of a survey administered at three points in first
   year, as well as focused interviews. Results will provide information
   about the degree to which students can identify and differentiate
   Communication Instructors and instruction from other parts of their
   academic experience, and the effectiveness of the MyCI insignia in
   transmitting accurate information about ECP and its instructors.}},

Abstract = {{We study near optimal error correction codes for real-time
   communication. In our setup the encoder must operate on an incoming
   source stream in a sequential manner, and the decoder must reconstruct
   each source packet within a fixed playback deadline of T packets. The
   underlying channel is a packet erasure channel that can introduce both
   burst and isolated losses.
   We first consider a class of channels that in any window of length T + 1
   introduce either a single erasure burst of a given maximum length B, or
   a certain maximum number N of isolated erasures. We demonstrate that for
   a fixed rate and delay, there exists a tradeoff between the achievable
   values of B and N, and propose a family of codes that is near optimal
   with respect to this tradeoff. We also consider another class of
   channels that introduce both a burst and an isolated loss in each window
   of interest and develop the associated streaming codes.
   All our constructions are based on a layered design and provide
   significant improvements over baseline codes in simulations over the
   Gilbert-Elliott channel.}},

   channels, a class of (mainly nonlinear) channels described by a Lax
   operator-pair. For such channels, the nonlinear Fourier transform, a
   powerful tool in soliton theory and exactly solvable models, plays the
   same role in ``diagonalizing{''} the channel that the ordinary Fourier
   transform plays for linear convolutional channels. A transmission
   strategy encoding information in the nonlinear Fourier spectrum, termed
   nonlinear frequency-division multiplexing, is proposed for integrable
   channels that is the nonlinear analogue of orthogonal frequency-division
   multiplexing commonly used in linear channels. A central and motivating
   example is fiber-optic data transmission, for which the proposed
   transmission technique deals with both dispersion and nonlinearity
   directly and unconditionally without the need for dispersion or
   nonlinearity compensation methods.}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the looming ``capacity crunch{''} in current fiber-optic
   systems, we recently suggested using the nonlinear Fourier transform
   (NFT) to transmit information over integrable communication channels
   such as the optical fiber channel, which is governed by the generalized
   nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In this transmission scheme information
   is encoded in the nonlinear Fourier transform of the signal, consisting
   of two components: a discrete and a continuous spectral function. In
   this paper, we restrict to discrete spectrum modulation and provide some
   simple examples of achievable spectral efficiencies. With this new
   method, deterministic distortions arising from the dispersion and
   nonlinearity, such as inter-symbol and interchannel interference are
   zero for a single user channel or all users of a multiple user network.}},

Abstract = {{We study sequential streaming of Gauss-Markov sources over a
   burst-erasure channel. In any sliding window of length L, the channel
   introduces a single erasure burst of maximum length B. The encoder
   observes a sequence of vector Gaussian sources, where the vectors are
   i.i.d. across the spatial dimension and correlated across the temporal
   dimension. The encoder output can depend on all source vectors observed
   up to that time but not on any future source vectors. The decoder is
   required to reconstruct the source vectors instantaneously and within a
   quadratic distortion constraint of D, except those source vectors that
   either appear during the erasure periods or a recovery period of W
   following each erasure burst. We focus on time-invariant encoders and
   establish upper and lower bounds on the minimum compression rate R(L, B,
   W, D). Our lower bound is obtained by making connection to a Gaussian
   multi-terminal source coding problem. The upper bound is based on
   distributed source coding, but requires a careful analysis of the
   achievable rate. Numerical comparisons indicate that the proposed
   technique provides significant gains over other baseline schemes.}},

Abstract = {{We study two multiple-access scenarios with encoders that are informed
   only intermittently. The first is the Gaussian multiple-access channel
   with an intermittent feedback link. Here we assume that, depending on
   the current binary state which evolves in a memoryless fashion, the
   previous channel output is either revealed to the two encoders or not.
   For this scenario we obtain an outer bound on the capacity region that
   approaches the capacity region without feedback when the probability
   that the channel output will be fed back approaches zero. We also
   propose an inner bound that converges to the capacity region with ideal
   feedback and the capacity region with no feedback in the associated
   extreme cases.
   In the second scenario the encoders always observe ideal feedback, and
   in addition they can crib intermittently. For this scenario we establish
   the capacity region for the special class of semi-deterministic
   multiple-access channels. The capacity is achieved using the
   Superposition Block Markov Coding technique of Cover and Leung.
   For both scenarios the outer bounds are tighter than those obtained by
   revealing the underlying state sequence non-causally to the encoders.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of cooperative rescue robot teams in urban search and rescue
   (USAR) missions is for the rescue robots to effectively work together in
   order to minimize the overall exploration time it takes to search
   disaster scenes and find as many victims as possible. To achieve this
   goal, task allocation and execution amongst the team members must be
   considered. In this paper, a unique hierarchical reinforcement learning
   (HRL) based semi-autonomous control architecture is proposed for rescue
   robot teams to enable cooperative learning between the robot team
   members. The HRL-based control architecture allows a multi-robot rescue
   team to collectively make decisions regarding which rescue tasks need to
   be carried out at a given time, and which team member should execute
   them to achieve optimal performance in exploration and victim
   identification. Due to the cluttered nature of disaster scenes, we
   propose the development of a semi-autonomous centralized control
   approach to allow task sharing between the robot team members and human
   operators when needed. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of
   the proposed HRL-based methodology for multi-robot cooperative
   exploration and victim identification in USAR-like scenes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents the development of a semi-autonomous exploration
   approach for a rescue robot team exploring unknown urban search and
   rescue (USAR) environments. The approach consists of a direction-based
   exploration technique utilized by multiple robots to search an unknown
   cluttered environment. The technique uses an occupancy grid approach
   that uniquely considers: 1) the terrain information of an environment by
   classifying obstacle cells as climbable or non-climbable cells, as well
   as 2) the direction of approach of a robot into a cell in order to
   determine a robot's ability to traverse a cell of interest. A distance
   threshold technique is employed to determine when the robots in a team
   should share this information with each other to minimize exploration
   overlap. The performance of the direction-based semi-autonomous
   exploration approach was investigated and compared to autonomous
   exploration of the same robot teams in simulations conducted in USARSim.
   The results verified that there was a statistically significant increase
   in exploration coverage using the semi-autonomous exploration mode over
   the fully autonomous exploration mode. The simulations also verified the
   potential use of semi-autonomous exploration of a team with multiple
   rescue robots.}},

   management in many aspects of daily lives, such as application login,
   access control and transaction security. This paper presents a novel
   approach to individual identification based on a new biometric modality
   Transient Evoked Otoacoustic Emission (TEOAE), which is a low level
   acoustic signal generated by human cochlea and detected in the outer ear
   canal. We resort to wavelet analysis to derive the time-frequency
   representation of such non-stationary signal and machine learning
   techniques: linear discriminant analysis and softmax regression to
   accomplish pattern recognition. We also introduce a complete framework
   of the biometric system considering practical application. Experiments
   on a TEOAE dataset of biometric setting show the merits of the proposed
   method. With fusion of information from both ears an average
   identification rate 98.72\% is achieved.}},

   target signatures are often too weak. In comparison, the
   forward-scattered signals are much more sensitive to a target since it
   is likely to affect their attenuation. On the other hand, the ability of
   current imaging algorithms to achieve good range resolution depends
   critically on the availability of back-scattered signals. Here, we
   propose a method to achieve good range resolution with forward-scattered

Abstract = {{In response to a few recent publications that deny the existence of
   negative refraction at a single interface on the grounds that it
   violates causality, an investigation is performed using two-dimensional
   transmission-line grids. Containing only passive elements and simulated
   using a standard circuit simulator, the transient response of an
   obliquely incident Gaussian beam on a negative-refractive-index material
   is examined.
   Phase velocity and group velocity (power) are both shown to refract
   negatively. The refracted beam front, however, is no longer parallel to
   the phase fronts. In order to remain causal, it must always maintain a
   positive angle with respect to the interface. This front is called the
   group front, and despite facing in a different direction, it propagates
   in the direction of the group velocity.
   The effect of adding a second interface to the simulation is also shown.
   In this case, the wave emerging from the negative-refractive-index slab
   is parallel to the incident wave.}},

Abstract = {{An analogy is demonstrated between negative group delay (NGD) networks
   and non-Foster reactive elements. It is shown that non-Foster elements
   and NGD networks influence a propagating wave in an equivalent manner.
   Based on this analogy, a novel method for the design of non-Foster
   elements using loss-compensated NGD networks is proposed. This method
   introduces a new perspective in realizing non-Foster elements based on
   wave propagation theory and dispersion engineering, as opposed to the
   traditional methods which are based on network theory. This method
   provides a way around the challenging stability problems of the
   traditional designs. Subsequently, a loss compensation method for NGD
   networks using regular unilateral amplifiers is presented that can be
   employed to design unilateral non-Foster elements. Such non-Foster
   elements can prove useful for guided-wave applications where a traveling
   wave is required to propagate in a certain direction. One design of a
   representative unilateral non-Foster element is presented using
   simulations and experiments.}},

Abstract = {{We apply algorithmic noise-tolerance (ANT) techniques {[}1] to improve
   the energy efficiency of DSP circuits implemented on FPGAs. Our approach
   leverages the programmable power architectural feature in Altera
   commercial FPGAs that allows internal logic blocks to operate in two
   modes {[}2]: high speed or low (leakage) power. We build a main DSP
   circuit with high utilization of low-power mode blocks, reducing its
   speed and introducing errors into its output. The errors are
   subsequently (partially) corrected by a second (smaller) estimation
   circuit, producing an overall system with higher performance accuracy
   and lower power than a baseline system built with high-speed logic on
   its timing-critical paths. We demonstrate a filter implemented in a 40nm
   commercial FPGA that incorporates ANT and achieves higher SNR using 15\%
   less static power than a traditional filter (without ANT).}},

Abstract = {{Non-Foster reactive elements such as negative capacitors and negative
   inductors hold promise for a number of important applications such as
   broadband small antennas (beyond the Chu limit), broadband matching
   networks (beyond the Bode-Fano limit) and squint-free series-fed and
   leaky-wave antennas. Traditionally, negative capacitors and inductors
   have been implemented using negative-impedance converters (NICs) and
   negative-impedance inverters (NIIs). However, these NIC and NII circuits
   are prone to instabilities and excessive noise. In this article, we
   highlight a new perspective in realizing non-Foster reactive elements
   using negative-group-delay (NGD) networks. The underlying NGD networks
   are completely passive and thus stable. However, NGD are associated with
   some kind of loss (resistive or reflective) which can be compensated
   using amplifiers. The stable operation of these elements can lead to
   interesting antenna applications discussed in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The cleanliness of high strength low alloy (HSLA) steel was assessed
   qualitatively and quantitatively. The determination of inclusion type
   and inclusion morphology were carried out using Selective Potentiostatic
   Etching by Electrolytic Dissolution (SPEED) method allowing in-situ
   examination of inclusion morphology by analytical techniques such as
   SEM/EDS. Inclusion size analysis mainly involved a combination of an
   analytical technique to provide images of the sample surface and an
   image analysis system to accurately measure the inclusion size. Four
   analytical methods were compared in order to evaluate their suitability
   for subsequent quantitative analysis. It was found that images taken
   with backscattered electron imaging mode from the scanning electron
   microscope provides the most accurate representation of inclusion
   distribution. The various techniques were used to evaluate HSLA steel
   grades of similar chemistry produced with and without gas purging of the
   refractory nozzle between ladle and tundish. The results confirmed that
   with reoxidation minimized by gas purging between ladle and tundish, the
   steel cleanliness was significantly improved.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we examine the predictability of genetic algorithm (GA)
   performance using information-theoretic fitness landscape measures. The
   outcome of a GA is largely based on the choice of search operator,
   problem representation and tunable parameters (crossover and mutation
   rates, etc). In particular, given a problem representation the choice of
   search operator will determine, along with the fitness function, the
   structure of the landscape that the GA will search upon. Statistical and
   information theoretic measures have been proposed that aim to quantify
   properties (ruggedness, smoothness, etc) of this landscape. In this
   paper we concentrate on the utility of information theoretic measures to
   predict algorithm output for various instances of the capacitated and
   time-windowed vehicle routing problem. Using a clustering-based approach
   we identify similar landscape structures within these problems and
   propose to compare GA results to these clusters using performance
   profiles. These results highlight the potential for predicting GA
   performance, and providing insight self-configurable search operator
   design.}},

Abstract = {{The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system
   is the most recognized green building certification program in North
   America. In order to be LEED certified, a building must earn a certain
   number of points, which are obtained through achieving certain credits
   or design elements. Prior to LEED version 3, each credit was worth one
   point. In this study, we develop an inverse optimization approach to
   examine how building designers intrinsically valued design elements in
   LEED version 2. Due to the large dimensionality of the inverse
   optimization problem, we develop an approximation to improve
   tractability. We apply our method to 18 different LEED-certified
   buildings in the United States. We find that building designers did not
   value all credits equally and that other factors such as cost and
   certification level play a role in how the credits are valued. Overall,
   inverse optimization may provide a new method to assess historical data
   and support the design of future versions of LEED.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the nonlinear vibration of a thin-plate workpiece during
   milling process is investigated. The thin-plate workpiece is modeling as
   a cantilevered thin plate. The equations of motion for the thin-plate
   workpiece are derived based on the Kirchhoff-plate theory and the von
   Karman straindisplacement relations by using the Hamilton's principle.
   By applying the Galerkin's approach, the resulting equations are reduced
   to a two-degree-of-freedom nonlinear system with external excitations.
   Considering the case of 1:1 internal resonance, the method of Asymptotic
   Perturbation method is utilized to obtain the averaged equations of the
   cantilevered thin-plate workpiece. Numerical method is used to study
   nonlinear dynamics of the cantilevered thin plate and get the
   two-dimensional phase portraits, waveforms phase, threedimensional phase
   and frequency spectrum phase. The result shows that the cantilevered
   thin-plate workpiece exhibits the complex dynamic behavior with the
   increase of the amplitude of the forcing excitation.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the model of a micro-machined beam-type resonator is
   presented. The resonator is a micro-bridge which is modeled using
   Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. A comb-drive electrostatic actuator is
   attached to the micro-bridge for the excitation/detection of vibrations.
   In the models presented in the literature, it is assumed that the center
   of mass of the comb-drive is located on the neutral axis of the beam. In
   this paper, it is demonstrated that this assumption can not be applied
   for asymmetric-shaped comb-drives. Furthermore, the governing equations
   of motion are derived by relaxing the above assumption. It has been
   shown that the off-axis center of mass of the comb-drive generates an
   amplitude-dependent transverse force in the beam, which is essentially a
   nonlinear effect. The governing equations of motion are solved using a
   hybrid analytical-numerical approach. The end application of the
   structure under investigation is in resonant sensing and energy
   harvesting applications.}},

Abstract = {{Piezoelectric material has been widely utilized in vibration-based
   energy harvesters (VEH). The most common configuration of piezoelectric
   energy harvester is a cantilevered beam with unimorph or bimorph
   piezoelectric layers. In this paper, a new configuration of PEH is
   proposed. Two beams are assembled as V shape with tip masses attached.
   The first beam is a cantilevered beam with tip mass while the second
   beam is attached to the end of the first beam with a certain angle.
   Piezoelectric layers are attached to both beams in unimorph
   configuration for power generation. The analytical solution is derived
   based on Euler-Bernoulli beam theory. In this analysis, the angle varies
   from 0 to 135 degree to see the influence of angle on voltage and power
   frequency response. The V-shaped VEH is proven to have the second
   resonant frequency relatively close to the first resonant frequency when
   compared with conventional cantilevered VEH. Furthermore, the angle
   between the two beams will influence the ratio of the second to the
   first resonant frequency. By choosing a suitable angle, the V-shaped
   structure can effectively broaden the bandwidth.}},

   microfluidic device for trapping and immobilization of single mouse

   microinjection of mouse embryos for large-scale biomolecule testing. The
   working principle of the device is based on the hydrodynamic trapping
   effect generated when a vacuum (e.g., negative pressure) is applied to
   micrometer-sized through-holes on a glass substrate. A novel
   microfabrication process is developed for device construction, which
   includes two-sided glass wet etching and polydimethylsiloxane
   (PDMS)glass oxygen plasma bonding. Experimental results of single embryo
   trapping and microinjection demonstrate that the device is capable of
   trapping and immobilizing 25 mouse embryos within 31 s, and that the
   hydrodynamic immobilization does not produce negative effects on
   embryonic development after microinjection.}},

   to validate the results obtained, and to compare with smooth fibre
   thermal contact resistance for rough and smooth fibres. The thermal

   orientation and contact forces; it was determined that values for rough
   fibre contact are on average twice that of the contact of smooth fibres.}},

Booktitle = {{TRANSPORT SURVEY METHODS: BEST PRACTICE FOR DECISION MAKING}},

Pages = {{257-277}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - The main objective of this survey is to collect data for the
   development of six models in a freight modeling framework. The framework
   aims to simulate the interactions between shippers and carriers in a
   freight market.
   Methodology/approach - A web-based survey was designed using stated
   preference methods and experimental auctions, to collect information
   about shipper and carrier behavior when facing hypothetical situations.
   Hypothetical situations were constructed using information collected
   during the survey.
   Findings - The modeling results are available for one model, the carrier
   selection model. In this model, data were collected using stated
   preference (SP) methods. Nine SP designs were developed using D-designs
   and an approach to minimize the nonattendance problem. A multinomial
   probit model was used. No bias was found due to the position of
   alternatives on the screen, signs of the parameters are as expected, and
   level of service attributes are relevant in the carrier selection
   process.
   Research limitations/implications - The final response rate was small
   (about 9\%) which is not uncommon in surveys with freight managers. This
   response rate might result in nonresponse bias of the estimates, which
   is the subject of future research.
   Practical implications - Since freight transport is the output of a
   freight market, the application of the freight modeling framework
   presented in this chapter has potential to improve forecasts of freight
   flows.
   Originality/value of chapter - To the best of our knowledge, the survey
   presented in this chapter consists of an innovative data collection
   procedure for the development of an original freight modeling framework.}},

Title = {{Semantic Approach to Capture Psychological Factors Affecting Mode
   Choice: Comparative Results from Canada and Chile}},
Booktitle = {{TRANSPORT SURVEY METHODS: BEST PRACTICE FOR DECISION MAKING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Pages = {{625-642}},
Abstract = {{Purpose - Study the causal effect of psychological factors on mode
   choice, using an instrument which gathered attitudinal, affective and
   habitual behaviour factors, with an application to a Canadian and
   Chilean sample.
   Approach - Ad hoc questionnaire used to collect information related to
   psychological factors, studying the role of these factors upon mode
   choice using structural equation modelling, combining a measurement
   model and the latent variables.
   Findings - Emotional (affective) factors have a strong influence on mode
   choice, as well as attitudinal and habitual factors. Car users have a
   strong positive emotion to the transport mode they use when compared
   with public transport users and transit utilization.
   Research limitations - The inclusion of social factors, such as norm,
   role and self-concept, is desirable for a better understanding of
   people's behaviour regarding transport mode usage. The structural
   equation modelling was used to analyse the causal effects among factors,
   but it is not intended to model mode choice. An advanced approach would
   be to estimate a hybrid discrete choice model.
   Practical implications - Realizing the real importance of personal
   psychological factors on mode choice is a key issue when intending to
   implement mobility and travel demand management strategies. The success
   of these strategies strongly relies on people's change of behaviour,
   which does not depend only on instrumental and socio-demographic
   factors, such as cost, time and income, but also on these very inner
   personal aspects.
   Originality/value - Capture psychological factors through a
   comprehensive survey, which rests on a psychological framework and
   considers simultaneously attitudinal, affective and habitual personal
   factors, as well as instrumental and socio-demographic information. Make
   a comparison among cities belonging to different countries regarding the
   role of these factors, cities with a different cultural and social
   background.}},

Journal = {{BIOFOULING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{29}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{77-85}},
Abstract = {{The freshwater zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is a notorious
   biofouling organism. It adheres to a variety of substrata underwater by
   means of a proteinaceous structure called the byssus, which consists of
   a number of threads with adhesive plaques at the tips. The byssal
   proteins are difficult to characterize due to extensive cross-linking of
   3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), which renders the mature structure
   largely resistant to protein extraction and immunolocalization. By
   inducing secretion of fresh threads and plaques in which cross-linking
   is minimized, three novel zebra mussel byssal proteins were identified
   following extraction and separation by gel electrophoresis. Peptide
   fragment fingerprinting was used to match tryptic digests of several gel
   bands against a cDNA library of genes expressed uniquely in the mussel
   foot, the organ which secretes the byssus. This allowed identification
   of a more complete sequence of Dpfp2 (D. polymorpha foot protein 2), a
   known DOPA-containing byssal protein, and a partial sequence of Dpfp5, a
   novel protein with several typical characteristics of mussel adhesive
   proteins.}},

Journal = {{STRUCTURE AND INFRASTRUCTURE ENGINEERING}},

Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{201-213}},
Abstract = {{The objective of this article is to evaluate the influence of material,
   structural design variables and exposure conditions on the service life
   and cost effectiveness of precast concrete culverts in Canada. This
   investigation will assist practicing engineers to account for long-term
   performance and integrate life cycle analysis into design and
   construction decisions. The design variables considered in this study
   include the percentage of ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS)
   as cement replacement, reinforcing steel cover depth and culvert size.
   This study proposes the usage of a life-cycle cost assessment approach
   to compare different culvert designs on an economic basis which accounts
   for the design variables and the impact of CO2 production and uptake
   over the life of a culvert from cradle to grave. Analysis of each
   culvert scenario includes the cost of the initial production of CO2
   during the manufacturing process as well as the cost savings that were
   incurred due to the uptake of CO2 through carbonation processes.
   Overall, the present cost of the culverts is controlled by the GGBFS
   content and the reinforcing steel cover depth while carbonation
   processes have a relatively small economic impact.}},

Abstract = {{In various microfluidic devices, surface tension and interfacial tension
   values are necessary to analyze the fluid behavior in microchannels, and
   evaluating the values of interfacial tension is especially important for
   gas-liquid and liquid-liquid flows. A pendant drop method is commonly
   used to measure the interfacial tension value; however, the pendant drop
   method requires strict accuracy in measuring the droplet size when the
   droplet has a nonspherical shape, as well as an accurate value of the
   density difference between the two liquids. In this work, a new
   measurement method called the ``liquid bridge-inducing microscale
   contact method{''} has been developed in which the interfacial tension
   can be obtained from the bridging of two liquid droplets extruded from
   opposing ends of glass capillary tubes or formed on the ends of round
   metal rods. By measuring the radii of curvature of each liquid surface
   and interface, we calculate the Laplace pressure on the surface and
   interface, and derive the interfacial tension value using the Laplace
   equation. The results show that the values of interfacial tension
   obtained from the two methods are approximately the same and that the
   liquid bridge-inducing microscale contact method is capable of accurate
   interfacial tension measurements.}},

Abstract = {{A pair of optical void sensors and a high-speed video camera were used

   patterns, void fraction, and velocities of gas plug/slug and liquid
   slugs were measured at different axial locations between the gas-liquid
   mixer and microchannel exit. The pressure decreased linearly in the
   first half of the microchannel, and more rapidly and nonlinearly in the
   second half of the test section. As a result, the flow accelerated
   significantly in the second half of the microchannel such that the void
   fraction and liquid slug velocity increased nonlinearly. The measured
   mean void fraction and mean velocity of liquid slugs also agreed well
   with the homogeneous flow model predictions when the liquid flow rate

Abstract = {{Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) efficiently convert chemical energy into
   electrical energy with fuel flexibility and low emissions. Plasma
   spraying has emerged as a fabrication technique for metal-supported
   SOFCs. Residual stresses in suspension plasma sprayed (SPS)
   yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes fabricated with various
   processing parameters and substrates were analyzed by X-ray diffraction.
   The temperature dependence of the residual stresses was also evaluated.
   The electrolyte residual stresses varied with both processing conditions
   and substrate characteristics, and ranged from 35 to 91 MPa. The change
   in stresses agreed well with the observed microstructural changes
   arising from the use of different processing conditions and substrates.
   The electrolytes fabricated using torch power and standoff distance of
   133 kW and 90 mm exhibited the highest residual stress due to the their
   relatively dense microstructure with low level of vertical cracking
   compared to electrolytes made with the other spray conditions. As these
   electrolytes were heated from room temperature to 750 degrees C,
   residual stresses decreased from 91 to 39 MPa. The decrease is due to
   changes in Young's modulus and to thermal expansion mismatch between the
   layers, and possibly also due to the formation of additional microcracks
   or creep of the porous stainless steel substrate. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {{For systems with hidden or unrevealed failures, a common practice is to
   inspect the system regularly, since failures can only be detected upon
   inspection. Recent works in the literature have studied the availability
   of a system under periodic inspection, assuming perfect
   repair/replacement with non-negligible downtime due to
   repair/replacement for a detected failure. In some situations, however,
   not only downtime due to repair/replacement but also downtime due to
   inspection is non-negligible regardless whether a failure was detected
   or not. In this paper, we consider the availability of a system subject

Title = {{Ensuring units invariant slack selection in radial data envelopment
   analysis models, and incorporating slacks into an overall efficiency
   score}},

Volume = {{41}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{This paper introduces a new methodology ensuring units invariant slack
   selection in radial DEA models and incorporating the slacks into an
   overall efficiency score. The CCR and BCC models are units invariant in
   their radial component, but not in their slack component, thus changing
   the units of measurement of one or more variables can change the models'
   solution. The proposed Full Proportional Slack (FPS) methodology
   improves the slack selections of the CCR and BCC models by producing
   slack selections that (a) are units invariant, thus producing fully
   units invariant models, (b) maximize the relative improvements
   represented by the slacks, and not their values, and (c) measure the
   full slacks that need to be removed from their corresponding variables.
   The FPS methodology is a fully oriented methodology first maximizing the
   improvements in the variables on the side of the orientation of the
   model. The Proportional Slack Adjusted (PSA) methodology incorporates
   the FPS slacks into an overall efficiency score, making it easier to
   interpret and use the results. The FPS and PSA methodologies are
   illustrated using an input oriented VRS Loan Quality DEA model with data
   from the retail branch network of one of Canada's largest banks. (C)

Abstract = {{Antibody-mediated imaging of amyloid beta (A beta) in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) offers a promising strategy to detect and monitor specific
   A beta species, such as oligomers, that have important pathological and
   therapeutic relevance. The major current limitation of antibodies as a
   diagnostic and imaging device is poor blood-brain-barrier permeability.
   A classical anti-A beta antibody, 6E10, is modified with 10 kDa
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a positron emitting isotope, Copper-64
   (t(1/2) = 12.7 h), and intravenously delivered to the TgCRND8 mouse
   model of Alzheimer's disease. Modification of 6E10 with PEG (6E10-PEG)
   increases accumulation of 6E10 in brain tissue in both TgCRND8 and wild
   type control animals. 6E10-PEG differentiates TgCRND8 animals from wild
   type controls using positron emission tomography (PET) and provides a
   framework for using antibodies to detect pathology using non-invasive
   medical imaging techniques.}},

Title = {{Semi-Automatic In Silico Gap Closure Enabled De Novo Assembly of Two
   Dehalobacter Genomes from Metagenomic Data}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{Typically, the assembly and closure of a complete bacterial genome
   requires substantial additional effort spent in a wet lab for gap
   resolution and genome polishing. Assembly is further confounded by
   subspecies polymorphism when starting from metagenome sequence data. In
   this paper, we describe an in silico gap-resolution strategy that can
   substantially improve assembly. This strategy resolves assembly gaps in
   scaffolds using pre-assembled contigs, followed by verification with
   read mapping. It is capable of resolving assembly gaps caused by
   repetitive elements and subspecies polymorphisms. Using this strategy,
   we realized the de novo assembly of the first two Dehalobacter genomes
   from the metagenomes of two anaerobic mixed microbial cultures capable
   of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethanes and chloroform. Only
   four additional PCR reactions were required even though the initial
   assembly with Newbler v. 2.5 produced 101 contigs within 9 scaffolds
   belonging to two Dehalobacter strains. By applying this strategy to the
   re-assembly of a recently published genome of Bacteroides, we
   demonstrate its potential utility for other sequencing projects, both
   metagenomic and genomic.}},

Abstract = {{How species with similar repertoires of protein-coding genes differ so
   markedly at the phenotypic level is poorly understood. By comparing
   organ transcriptomes from vertebrate species spanning similar to 350
   million years of evolution, we observed significant differences in
   alternative splicing complexity between vertebrate lineages, with the
   highest complexity in primates. Within 6 million years, the splicing
   profiles of physiologically equivalent organs diverged such that they
   are more strongly related to the identity of a species than they are to
   organ type. Most vertebrate species-specific splicing patterns are
   cis-directed. However, a subset of pronounced splicing changes are
   predicted to remodel protein interactions involving trans-acting
   regulators. These events likely further contributed to the
   diversification of splicing and other transcriptomic changes that
   underlie phenotypic differences among vertebrate species.}},

Abstract = {{The interactions between a silica substrate and iron particles were
   investigated using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy
   (AFM). The micrometer- and nanosized iron particles employed were either
   bare or coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a polymer utilized to
   stabilize iron particle suspensions. The effect of water chemistry on
   the forces of interaction was probed by varying ionic strength (with 100
   mM NaCl and 100 mM CaCl2) or pH (4, 5.5, and 8) or by introducing 10
   mg/L of humic acids (HA). When particles were uncoated, the forces upon
   approach between silica and iron were attractive at pH 4 and 5.5 and in
   100 mM CaCl2 at pH 8, but they were negligible in 100 mM NaCl buffered
   to pH 8 and repulsive in water buffered to pH 8 and in HA solutions. HA
   produced electrosteric repulsion between iron particles and silica,
   likely due to its sorption to iron particles. HA sorption to silica was
   excluded on the basis of experiments conducted with a quartz-crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring. Repulsion with CMC-coated iron
   was attributed to electrosteric forces, which were damped at high ionic
   strength. An extended DLVO model and a modified version of Ohshima's
   theory were successfully utilized to model AFM data.}},

   the dark and the illumination stresses for the InGaZnO thin film

   properties exhibit an obvious negative threshold voltage shift and a
   significant degradation of subthreshold swing. The photoelectric heat
   effect that combined the effects of electric field, illumination, and
   temperature induces the generation of dangling bonds in the interface,
   resulting in an apparent degradation. It is related to the presence of
   light energy. Finally, this work also employs the capacitance-voltage

   degradation behaviors. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In this work, cultivation of photosynthetic microbes in surface plasmon
   enhanced evanescent fields is demonstrated. Proliferation of
   Synechococcus elongatus was obtained on gold surfaces excited with
   surface plasmons. Excitation over three days resulted in 10 mu m thick
   biofilms with maximum cell volume density of 20\% vol/vol (2\% more
   total accumulation than control experiments with direct light).
   Collectively, these results indicate the ability to (1) excite
   surface-bound cells using plasmonic light fields, and (2) subsequently
   grow thick biofilms by coupling light from the surface. Plasmonic light
   delivery presents opportunities for high-density optofluidic
   photobioreactors for microalgal analysis and solar fuel production. (C)

Abstract = {{The evolution of microstructure upon different annealing conditions in
   the Ni-carbonyl chemical vapor deposited (CVD) Ni material was
   investigated systematically in the present study by differential
   scanning calorimetry (DSC), optical microscopy and transmission electron
   microscopy (TEM) with both ex situ and hot-stage in situ annealing
   approaches. TEM observations reveal that the as-deposited CVD nickel
   possesses a bi-modal grain structure, with large columnar grains
   embedded in a nano-grained matrix. The large columnar grains are found
   to be full of ultrafine- and nano-growth twins: there are also scattered
   fivefold symmetry grains as large as 3-5 mu m. Microstructure
   observations upon annealing show that grain growth did not occur until
   annealing at 400 degrees C or higher, and the nano-grain matrix grew
   into large equaxial grains above 600 degrees C. A major microstructural
   evolution phenomenon, the detwinning process was observed at 400 degrees
   C or higher temperatures, and twin boundary receding in the detwinning
   process was found to have a number of mechanisms all involving
   dislocation activities. Upon annealing, the ultrafine- and nano-twins
   were found to transform into dislocation cell structures and this
   phenomenon is considered to be driven by the excess free energy
   associated with the high density of grown-in twin boundaries. The large
   sized, fivefold twinned grains found in the as-processed bulk deposited
   Ni are found to be thermally stable up to 600 degrees C. Surface
   dragging effect to twin and grain boundaries is detected during the
   hot-stage in situ TEM observation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights

   = 1/2 (i+j-2) cos (i-j)omega appears in connection with the design of
   finite impulse response (FIR) digital filters with real coefficients. We
   prove several results about its eigenvalues; in particular, assuming N
   >= 4 we prove that P(omega) has one positive and one negative eigenvalue
   when omega/pi is an integer, while it has two positive and two negative
   eigenvalues when omega/pi is not an integer. We also show that for
   omega/pi not being an integer and a sufficiently large N. the two
   positive eigenvalues converge to alpha N-+(2) and the two negative
   eigenvalues to alpha N--(2), where alpha(+/-) = (1 +/- 2/root 3/)/8.
   Furthermore, an equivalent transformation diagonalizing P(omega) is
   described. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Global divergence in critical income for adult and childhood survival:
   analyses of mortality using Michaelis-Menten}},
Journal = {{ELIFE}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{1}},
Month = {{DEC 13}},
Abstract = {{Life expectancy has risen sharply in the last 50 years. We applied the
   classic Michaelis-Menten enzyme kinetics to demonstrate a novel
   mathematical relationship of income to childhood (aged 0-5 years) and
   adult (aged 15-60 years) survival. We treat income as a substrate that
   is catalyzed to increase survival (from technologies that income buys)
   for 180 countries from 1970 and 2007. Michaelis-Menten kinetics permit
   estimates of maximal survival and, uniquely, the critical income needed
   to achieve half of the period-specific maximum. Maximum child and adult
   survival rose by about 1\% per year. Critical incomes fell by half for
   children, but doubled for men. HIV infection and smoking account for
   some, but not all, of the rising critical incomes for adult survival.
   Altering the future cost curve for adult survival will require more
   widespread use of current interventions, most notably tobacco control,
   but also research to identify practicable low-cost drugs, diagnostics,
   and strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Vascularization is critical for the survival of engineered tissues in
   vitro and in vivo. In vivo, angiogenesis involves endothelial cell
   proliferation and sprouting followed by connection of extended cellular
   processes and subsequent lumen propagation through vacuole fusion. We
   mimicked this process in engineering an organized capillary network
   anchored by an artery and a vein. The network was generated by inducing
   directed capillary sprouting from vascular explants on micropatterned
   substrates containing thymosin beta 4-hydrogel. The capillary outgrowths
   connected between the parent explants by day 21, a process that was
   accelerated to 14 d by application of soluble VEGF and hepatocyte growth
   factor. Confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy
   indicated the presence of tubules with lumens formed by endothelial
   cells expressing CD31, VE-cadherin, and von Willebrand factor. Cardiac
   tissues engineered around the resulting vasculature exhibited improved
   functional properties, cell striations, and cell-cell junctions compared
   with tissues without prevascularization. This approach uniquely allows
   easy removal of the vasculature from the microfabricated substrate and
   easy seeding of the tissue specific cell types in the parenchymal space.}},

Abstract = {{This paper provides a theoretical assessment of the safety
   considerations encountered in the simultaneous use of transcranial
   magnetic stimulation (TMS) and neurological interventions involving
   implanted metallic electrodes, such as electrocorticography. Metal
   implants are subject to magnetic forces due to fast alternating magnetic
   fields produced by the TMS coil. The question of whether the mechanical
   movement of the implants leads to irreversible damage of brain tissue is
   addressed by an electromagnetic simulation which quantifies the
   magnitude of imposed magnetic forces. The assessment is followed by a
   careful mechanical analysis determining the maximum tolerable force
   which does not cause irreversible tissue damage. Results of this
   investigation provide useful information on the range of TMS stimulator
   output powers which can be safely used in patients having metallic
   implants. It is shown that conventional TMS applications can be
   considered safe when applied on patients with typical electrode implants
   as the induced stress in the brain tissue remains well below the limit
   of tissue damage.}},

Title = {{Generalized method for computation of true thickness and x-ray intensity
   information in highly blurred sub-millimeter bone features in clinical
   CT images}},
Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{57}},
Number = {{23}},
Pages = {{8099-8116}},
Month = {{DEC 7}},
Abstract = {{In clinical computed tomography (CT) images, cortical bone features with
   sub-millimeter (sub-mm) thickness are substantially blurred, such that
   their thickness is overestimated and their intensity appears
   underestimated. Therefore, any inquiry of the geometry or the density of
   such bones based on these images is severely error prone. We present a
   model-based method for estimating the true thickness and intensity
   magnitude of cortical and trabecular bone layers at localized regions of
   complex shell bones down to 0.25 mm. The method also computes the width
   of the corresponding point spread function. This approach is applicable
   on any CT image data, and does not rely on any scanner-specific
   parameter inputs beyond what is inherently available in the images
   themselves. The method applied on CT intensity profiles of custom
   phantoms mimicking shell-bones produced average cortical thickness
   errors of 0.07 +/- 0.04 mm versus an average error of 0.47 +/- 0.29 mm
   in the untreated cases (t(55) = 10.92, p << 0.001)). Similarly, the
   average error of intensity magnitude estimates of the method were 22 +/-
   2.2 HU versus an error of 445 +/- 137 HU in the untreated cases (t(55)=
   26.48, p << 0.001)). The method was also used to correct the CT
   intensity profiles from a cadaveric specimen of the craniofacial
   skeleton (CFS) in 15 different regions. There was excellent agreement
   between the corrections and mu CT intensity profiles of the same regions
   used as a `gold standard' measure. These results set the groundwork
   towards restoring cortical bone geometry and intensity information in
   entire image data sets. This information is essential for the generation
   of finite element models of the CFS that can accurately describe the
   biomechanical behavior of its complex thin bone structures.}},

Title = {{Blood vessel hyperpermeability and pathophysiology in human tumour
   xenograft models of breast cancer: a comparison of ectopic and
   orthotopic tumours}},
Journal = {{BMC CANCER}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 5}},
Abstract = {{Background: Human tumour xenografts in immune compromised mice are
   widely used as cancer models because they are easy to reproduce and
   simple to use in a variety of pre-clinical assessments. Developments in
   nanomedicine have led to the use of tumour xenografts in testing
   nanoscale delivery devices, such as nanoparticles and polymer-drug
   conjugates, for targeting and efficacy via the enhanced permeability and
   retention (EPR) effect. For these results to be meaningful, the
   hyperpermeable vasculature and reduced lymphatic drainage associated
   with tumour pathophysiology must be replicated in the model. In
   pre-clinical breast cancer xenograft models, cells are commonly
   introduced via injection either orthotopically (mammary fat pad, MFP) or
   ectopically (subcutaneous, SC), and the organ environment experienced by
   the tumour cells has been shown to influence their behaviour.
   Methods: To evaluate xenograft models of breast cancer in the context of
   EPR, both orthotopic MFP and ectopic SC injections of MDA-MB-231-H2N
   cells were given to NOD scid gamma (NSG) mice. Animals with matched
   tumours in two size categories were tested by injection of a high
   molecular weight dextran as a model nanocarrier. Tumours were collected
   and sectioned to assess dextran accumulation compared to liver tissue as
   a positive control. To understand the cellular basis of these
   observations, tumour sections were also immunostained for endothelial
   cells, basement membranes, pericytes, and lymphatic vessels.
   Results: SC tumours required longer development times to become size
   matched to MFP tumours, and also presented wide size variability and
   ulcerated skin lesions 6 weeks after cell injection. The 3 week MFP
   tumour model demonstrated greater dextran accumulation than the size
   matched 5 week SC tumour model (for P < 0.10). Immunostaining revealed
   greater vascular density and thinner basement membranes in the MFP
   tumour model 3 weeks after cell injection. Both the MFP and SC tumours
   showed evidence of insufficient lymphatic drainage, as many fluid-filled
   and collagen IV-lined spaces were observed, which likely contain excess
   interstitial fluid.
   Conclusions: Dextran accumulation and immunostaining results suggest
   that small MFP tumours best replicate the vascular permeability required
   to observe the EPR effect in vivo. A more predictable growth profile and
   the absence of ulcerated skin lesions further point to the MFP model as
   a strong choice for long term treatment studies that initiate after a
   target tumour size has been reached.}},

   Growth Factor-21 (FGF21)-Induced Metabolism}},

Abstract = {{Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) has therapeutic potential for
   metabolic syndrome due to positive effects on fatty acid metabolism in
   liver and white adipose tissue. FGF21 also improves pancreatic islet
   survival in excess palmitate; however, much less is known about
   FGF21-induced metabolism in this tissue. We first confirmed
   FGF21-dependent activity in islets by identifying expression of the
   cognate coreceptor Klotho beta, and by measuring a ligand-stimulated
   decrease in acetyl-CoA carboxylase expression. To further reveal the
   effect of FGF21 on metabolism, we employed a unique combination of
   two-photon and confocal autofluorescence imaging of the NAD(P) H and
   mitochondrial NADH responses while holding living islets stationary in a
   microfluidic device. These responses were further correlated to
   mitochondrial membrane potential and insulin secretion.
   Glucose-stimulated responses were relatively unchanged by FGF21. In
   contrast, responses to glucose in the presence of palmitate were
   significantly reduced compared to controls showing diminished NAD(P) H,
   mitochondrial NADH, mitochondrial membrane potential, and insulin
   secretion. Consistent with the glucose-stimulated responses being
   smaller due to continued fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial membrane
   potential was increased in FGF21-treated islets by using the fatty acid
   transport inhibitor etomoxir. Citrate-stimulated NADPH responses were
   also significantly larger in FGF21-treated islets suggesting preference
   for citrate cycling rather than acetyl-CoA carboxylase-dependent fatty
   acid synthesis. Overall, these data show a reduction in
   palmitate-induced potentiation of glucose-stimulated metabolism and
   insulin secretion in FGF21-treated islets, and establish the use of
   autofluorescence imaging and microfluidic devices to investigate cell
   metabolism in a limited amount of living tissue.}},

   for devising intermediate set points to ensure feasibility of operation.
   A potential function is defined for each controllable unit of the
   microgrid such that minimizing the potential function corresponds to
   achieving the control goal. The set points are dynamically updated using
   communication within the microgrid. This strategy is generalized to
   include both local and system-wide constraints. Case studies are

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present Y-Geo, a new numerical code for
   geomechanical applications based on the combined finite-discrete element
   method (FDEM). FDEM is an innovative numerical technique that combines
   the advantages of continuum-based modeling approaches and discrete
   element methods to overcome the inability of these methods to capture
   progressive damage and failure processes in rock. In particular, FDEM
   offers the ability to explicitly model the transition from continuum to
   discontinuous behavior by fracture and fragmentation processes. Several
   algorithmic developments have been implemented in Y-Geo to specifically
   address a broad range of rock mechanics problems. These features include
   (1) a quasi-static friction law, (2) the Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion,
   (3) a rock joint shear strength criterion, (4) a dissipative impact
   model, (5) an in situ stress initialization routine, (6) a material
   mapping function (for an exact representation of heterogeneous models),
   and (7) a tool to incorporate material heterogeneity and transverse
   isotropy. Application of Y-Geo is illustrated with two case studies that
   span the capabilities of the code, ranging from laboratory tests to
   complex engineering-scale problems. (C) 2012 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{Cities globally are in the midst of taking action to reduce greenhouse
   gas (GHG) emissions. After the vital step of emissions quantification,
   strategies must be developed to detail how emissions reductions targets
   will be achieved. The Pathways to Urban Reductions in Greenhouse Gas
   Emissions (PURGE) model allows the estimation of emissions from four
   pertinent urban sectors: electricity generation, buildings, private
   transportation, and waste. Additionally, the carbon storage from urban
   and regional forests is modeled. An emissions scenario is examined for a
   case study of the greater Toronto, Ontario, Canada, area using data on
   current technology stocks and government projections for stock change.
   The scenario presented suggests that even with some aggressive targets
   for technological adoption (especially in the transportation sector), it
   will be difficult to achieve the less ambitious 2050 emissions reduction
   goals of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. This is largely
   attributable to the long life of the building stock and limitations of
   current retrofit practices. Additionally, demand reduction (through
   transportation mode shifting and building occupant behavior) will be an
   important component of future emissions cuts.}},

Abstract = {{We theoretically investigate the optical Anderson localization in the

   value of the nonlinear parameter and applying numerical simulations
   respectively, a critical behavior, a transformation from a localized
   state to a spreading state, is found. We use different initial power of
   the probe and obtain a series of critical values of the nonlinear
   parameter. Below the critical value, the localizing effect is enhanced
   with the increase of the nonlinear parameter. While above the critical
   value, the localized state is destroyed. We give a study of the critical
   behavior and the critical values corresponding to different physical
   parameters, including the intensity of the self-defocusing nonlinearity,
   the intensity of the lattice-forming beams and the randomness strength

Abstract = {{The main objective of the study was to investigate the ability of
   frequency-domain photothermal radiometry (PTR) and modulated
   luminescence (LUM) to detect secondary caries lesions on the walls of
   restorations (wall lesions). Changes in experimental PTR-LUM signals due
   to sequential demineralization on entire vertical walls of sectioned
   tooth samples were investigated. In addition, transverse
   micro-radiography (TMR) analysis (used as a gold standard) was conducted
   to measure the degree of demineralization that occurred in each sample.
   Statistical correlation between TMR results and PTR-LUM signals was
   determined using Pearson's correlation coefficient. LUM signals were
   found to be dominated by the scattered component of the incident laser
   beam. The more clinically relevant cases of localized demineralization
   and remineralization on vertical walls were also investigated to examine
   whether PTR-LUM signals are sensitive to demineralization and
   remineralization of much smaller areas. The overall results demonstrated
   that PTR-LUM is sensitive to progressive demineralization and
   remineralization on vertical walls of sectioned tooth samples. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Transmitting sub-wavelength information to the far-zone is of great
   interest for various electromagnetics and optics applications, e.g., for
   overcoming the diffraction limit in imaging or enabling
   multiple-input/multiple-output operation in closely spaced antennas. The
   common phenomenon in these applications is the conversion of evanescent
   to propagating waves. In this paper, we rigorously analyze and study
   evanescent-to-propagating wave conversion based on sub-wavelength
   metallic strip gratings. A theory is provided, which fully captures all
   diffracted fields and clearly highlights this conversion phenomenon. The
   Green's function of the strip gratings is constructed by introducing the
   spectral impulse response. This method solves the problem of the
   aperiodic excitation of the periodic grating and along the way provides
   insight and clear explanation of the evanescent-to-propagating wave
   conversion that takes place. All proposed results are validated against
   full-wave electromagnetic simulations. The theory is used to highlight
   and explain ``extraordinary{''} transmission through a sub-wavelength
   metal strip grating when excited by a current source. Finally, an
   interesting application is presented where a nonradiating arrangement of
   sources is made to radiate by converting and diffracting its reactive
   near-field spectrum into the propagating regime using a simple metal
   strip grating.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a methodology for extracting and verifying the
   high-frequencymodel parameters of the HICUM L0 and L2 models of a
   silicon-germanium HBT from device and circuit measurements in the
   110-325-GHz range. For the first time, the non-quasi-static effects,
   missing in the HICUM/L0 model, are found to be essential in accurately
   capturing the frequency dependence of the transistor maximum available
   power gain beyond the inflection frequency for unconditional stability.
   Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the optimal partitioning of the
   area and periphery components of the junction base-emitter,
   base-collector, and collector-substrate capacitances, and of the
   internal and external base and collector resistances can only be
   determined from S-parameter measurements beyond 200 GHz. The extracted
   models are validated on state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear circuits
   (amplifier, voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), and VCO + divider
   chain) operating at frequencies as high as 240 GHz.}},

Title = {{Computational Fluid Dynamics Evaluation of the Cross-Limb Stent Graft
   Configuration for Endovascular Aneurysm Repair}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICAL ENGINEERING-TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASME}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{134}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The technique of crossing the limbs of bifurcated modular stent grafts
   for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is often employed in the face of
   splayed aortic bifurcations to facilitate cannulation and prevent device
   kinking. However, little has been reported about the implications of
   cross-limb EVAR, especially in comparison to conventional EVAR. Previous
   computational fluid dynamics studies of conventional EVAR grafts have
   mostly utilized simplified planar stent graft geometries. We herein
   examined the differences between conventional and cross-limb EVAR by
   comparing their hemodynamic flow fields (i.e., in the ``direct{''} and
   ``cross{''} configurations, respectively). We also added a ``planar{''}
   configuration, which is commonly found in the literature, to identify
   how well this configuration compares to out-of-plane stent graft
   configurations from a hemodynamic perspective. A representative
   patient's cross-limb stent graft geometry was segmented using computed
   tomography imaging in Mimics software. The cross-limb graft geometry was
   used to build its direct and planar counterparts in SolidWorks.
   Physiologic velocity and mass flow boundary conditions and blood
   properties were implemented for steady-state and pulsatile transient
   simulations in ANSYS CFX. Displacement forces, wall shear stress (WSS),
   and oscillatory shear index (OSI) were all comparable between the direct
   and cross configurations, whereas the planar geometry yielded very
   different predictions of hemodynamics compared to the out-of-plane stent
   graft configurations, particularly for displacement forces. This
   single-patient study suggests that the short-term hemodynamics involved
   in crossing the limbs is as safe as conventional EVAR. Higher helicity
   and improved WSS distribution of the cross-limb configuration suggest
   improved flow-related thrombosis resistance in the short term. However,
   there may be long-term fatigue implications to stent graft use in the
   cross configuration when compared to the direct configuration. {[}DOI:

Title = {{PERT: A Method for Expression Deconvolution of Human Blood Samples from
   Varied Microenvironmental and Developmental Conditions}},
Journal = {{PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The cellular composition of heterogeneous samples can be predicted using
   an expression deconvolution algorithm to decompose their gene expression
   profiles based on pre-defined, reference gene expression profiles of the
   constituent populations in these samples. However, the expression
   profiles of the actual constituent populations are often perturbed from
   those of the reference profiles due to gene expression changes in cells
   associated with microenvironmental or developmental effects. Existing
   deconvolution algorithms do not account for these changes and give
   incorrect results when benchmarked against those measured by
   well-established flow cytometry, even after batch correction was
   applied. We introduce PERT, a new probabilistic expression deconvolution
   method that detects and accounts for a shared, multiplicative
   perturbation in the reference profiles when performing expression
   deconvolution. We applied PERT and three other state-of-the-art
   expression deconvolution methods to predict cell frequencies within
   heterogeneous human blood samples that were collected under several
   conditions (uncultured mono-nucleated and lineage-depleted cells, and
   culture-derived lineage-depleted cells). Only PERT's predicted
   proportions of the constituent populations matched those assigned by
   flow cytometry. Genes associated with cell cycle processes were highly
   enriched among those with the largest predicted expression changes
   between the cultured and uncultured conditions. We anticipate that PERT
   will be widely applicable to expression deconvolution strategies that
   use profiles from reference populations that vary from the corresponding
   constituent populations in cellular state but not cellular phenotypic
   identity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an on-chip hand-powered membrane pump using a
   robust patient-to-chip syringe interface. This approach enables safe
   sample collection, sample containment, integrated sharps disposal, high
   sample volume capacity, and controlled downstream flow with no
   electrical power requirements. Sample is manually injected into the
   device via a syringe and needle. The membrane pump inflates upon
   injection and subsequently deflates, delivering fluid to downstream
   components in a controlled manner. The device is fabricated from
   poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and silicone, using CO2 laser
   micromachining, with a total material cost of similar to 0.20
   USD/device. We experimentally demonstrate pump performance for both
   deionized (DI) water and undiluted, anticoagulated mouse whole blood,
   and characterize the behavior with reference to a resistor-capacitor
   electrical circuit analogy. Downstream output of the membrane pump is
   regulated, and scaled, by connecting multiple pumps in parallel. In
   contrast to existing on-chip pumping mechanisms that typically have low
   volume capacity (similar to 5 mu L) and sample volume throughput
   (similar to 1-10 mu l/min), the membrane pump offers high volume
   capacity (up to 240 mu l) and sample volume throughput (up to 125 mu
   l/min). (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {{In this paper we study the effect of receiver phase noise on single
   carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA). We show that
   common phase error rotates all the symbols by a certain angle and that
   the higher order frequency components of phase noise result in
   inter-carrier interference, or ICI and draw parallels to orthogonal
   frequency division multiple access (OFDMA). We then study the effect of
   phase noise on the performance of linear receivers that are often used
   in practice. In particular, we show that the amount of ICI affecting the
   subcarriers depends closely on the allocation of sub-carriers among
   different users and prove that the performance of linear receivers in
   the presence of receiver phase noise deteriorates much more in the case
   of interleaved SC-FDMA than in the case of localized SC-FDMA. We
   identify the association of the significant phase noise components with
   the components of multi-user interference to be the fundamental reason
   behind the performance gap between interleaved and localized SC-FDMA.}},

Abstract = {{Very high effective minority carrier lifetime (6.3 ms) and very low

   float-zone 1-2 Omega cm crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers by depositing
   a-Si:H films using grid-biased remote radio-frequency plasma enhanced
   chemical vapor deposition (RF PECVD). This method employs a
   semi-transparent DC biased-grid within the conventional RF PECVD
   configuration. The DC-biased grid is positioned between the RF
   electrodes in order to develop a remote plasma and thus allow control of
   the flux and type of precursors involved in the growth of hydrogenated
   amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) film. It is shown that compared to
   conventional RF diode, the grid-biased remote RF PECVD method produces
   a-Si:H films with superior passivating properties as well as
   significantly lower concentrations of void and SiH2 bonding and a lower
   overall hydrogen content, all of which contribute to a higher quality

Abstract = {{During the last decade, various steel casting products for steel
   building structures have been developed, such as connectors between
   brace members and gusset plates in braced frames. Some casting products
   are welded to steel sections such as tubular members and I-section
   members in building structures, where these members are expected to
   develop their capacity during a large-scale earthquake. In this
   situation, brittle fracture can be another concern of the casting
   products if there are defects in the connections. A study of defect
   tolerance for cast steel connections is therefore very important to
   prevent brittle fracture from weld defects or casting defects. This
   paper describes defect tolerances for cast steel connections in braced
   frames and explores the possibility of brittle fracture from assumed
   defects in typical cast steel connectors. A parametric study, which
   investigates the sensitivity of brittle fracture to defect size, defect
   location, and material mismatch effects, is described through cast steel
   connector models. A toughness scaling model is used for evaluating the
   occurrence of brittle fracture from assumed defects in the models. DOI:

Abstract = {{This paper sums up the International RILEM Workshop on Present and
   Future Durability Challenges for Reinforced Concrete Structures, held at
   ETH Zurich in Switzerland on 1718 April 2012. Major focus is put on the
   discussions. During the latter it was revealed that one of the key
   durability challenges lies in predicting the performance of new
   materials, where the increasing diversity of cement and concrete plays a
   major role. As most current engineering models are not capable of
   predicting actual field performance adequately, a knowledge-based
   approach to durability will become more important than ever. Only a
   scientific approach on a multi-scale and interdisciplinary level will
   allow predicting the performance of new materials (where no long-term
   experience is available for fitting purposes). This will facilitate the
   use of more performance-based durability design that is urgently needed
   to promote innovative, long-lasting solutions.}},

Abstract = {{Most concrete specifications tend to be prescriptive in nature and this
   can prevent concrete producers from optimizing their mixtures for local
   materials, and confuses the responsibility for the in-place performance
   of a structure. While it is generally agreed that performance is a
   superior way to specify concrete since it should clarify
   responsibilities and allow for innovation, many parties to construction
   are leery of adopting performance specifications. One of the major
   concerns is related to the lack of adequate performance tests and
   specification limits that relate to field performance. While current
   test methods are far from perfect, it is thought that there is
   sufficient experience to use them and that adoption of performance
   specifications will lead to development of better test methods.}},

Title = {{The Polyfunctionality of Human Memory CD8+ T Cells Elicited by Acute and
   Chronic Virus Infections Is Not Influenced by Age}},
Journal = {{PLOS PATHOGENS}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As humans age, they experience a progressive loss of thymic function and
   a corresponding shift in the makeup of the circulating CD8+ T cell
   population from naive to memory phenotype. These alterations are
   believed to result in impaired CD8+ T cell responses in older
   individuals; however, evidence that these global changes impact
   virus-specific CD8+ T cell immunity in the elderly is lacking. To gain
   further insight into the functionality of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in
   older individuals, we interrogated a cohort of individuals who were
   acutely infected with West Nile virus (WNV) and chronically infected
   with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). The cohort was
   stratified into young (<40 yrs), middle-aged (41-59 yrs) and aged (>60
   yrs) groups. In the aged cohort, the CD8+ T cell compartment displayed a
   marked reduction in the frequency of naive CD8+ T cells and increased
   frequencies of CD8+ T cells that expressed CD57 and lacked CD28, as
   previously described. However, we did not observe an influence of age on
   either the frequency of virus-specific CD8+ T cells within the
   circulating pool nor their functionality (based on the production of IFN
   gamma, TNF alpha, IL2, Granzyme B, Perforin and mobilization of CD107a).
   We did note that CD8+ T cells specific for WNV, CMV or EBV displayed
   distinct functional profiles, but these differences were unrelated to
   age. Collectively, these data fail to support the hypothesis that
   immunosenescence leads to defective CD8+ T cell immunity and suggest
   that it should be possible to develop CD8+ T cell vaccines to protect
   aged individuals from infections with novel emerging viruses.}},

Abstract = {{Poly(lactic acid) is a biobased and compostable thermoplastic polyester
   that has rapidly evolved into a competitive commodity material over the
   last decade. One key bottleneck in extending the use of PLA is the
   control of its crystallinity. Understanding the crystallization behavior
   is particularly crucial to control PLA's degradation rate, thermal
   resistance as well as optical, mechanical and barrier properties. PLA
   crystallization has also been a particularly rich topic from a
   fundamental point of view because of the existence of the two
   enantiomeric forms of lactic acid that can be used to control the
   crystallization rate but also to form high melting point stereocomplex
   structures. This article presents an overview of the current
   understanding on the fundamentals of PLA crystallization in quiescent
   conditions and on the practical means to enhance its rate. Data from the
   abundant literature on PLA crystallization were compiled and analyzed to
   provide comprehensive relationships between crystallization kinetics and
   the main molecular structure characteristics of PIA. In addition, the
   most promising efforts in enhancing PLA crystallization kinetics through
   plasticization or heterogeneous nucleation were reviewed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{The main challenge for RNAi therapeutics lies in systemic delivery of
   siRNA to the correct tissues and transporting them into the cytoplasm of
   targeted cells, at safe, therapeutic levels. Recently, we developed a
   high-density lipoprotein-mimicking peptide phospholipid scaffold (HPPS)
   and demonstrated its direct cytosolic delivery of siRNA in vitro,
   thereby bypassing endosomal trapping. Aim: We investigate the in vivo
   implementation of HPPS for siRNA delivery. Method \& results: After
   systemic administration in KB tumor-bearing mice, HPPS prolonged the
   blood circulation time of cholesterol-modified siRNA (chol-siRNA) by a
   factor of four, improved its biodistribution and facilitated its uptake
   in scavenger receptor class B type I overexpressed tumors. For
   therapeutic targeting to the bcl-2 gene, the HPPS-chol-si-bcl-2
   nanoparticles downregulated Bcl-2 protein, induced enhanced apoptosis
   (2.5-fold) in tumors when compared with controls (saline, HPPS,
   HPPS-chol-si-scramble and chol-si-bcl-2) and significantly inhibited
   tumor growth with no adverse effect. Conclusion: HPPS is a safe,
   efficient nanocarrier for RNAi therapeutics in vivo. Original submitted

Abstract = {{A tunable surface that promotes either hydrophobic or hydrophilic
   behavior of TiO2 films is produced with aerosol deposition. This process
   is capable of mass production by high-speed coating at room temperature

   to be economically viable, energy efficient, and environmentally
   friendly. Functional TiO2 films between 1 and 18 mu m thick are produced
   by directly depositing dry, 1-mu m TiO2 powders accelerated through a
   supersonic nozzle. Tunable film morphology due to a rough honeycomb
   surface structure yields variable water contact angles. When plasma
   treated with CF4, the films exhibit superhydrophilicity despite the
   rough honeycomb surface structure. Superhydrophilicity is due to the
   incorporation of fluorine in the film as shown using XPS.}},

   Loading}},

Abstract = {{A compact, fully-printed negative-refractive-index transmission-line
   (NRI-TL) metamaterial-loaded dipole antenna is proposed, which exhibits
   multiband resonant characteristics that are not harmonically related.
   The multiband behavior is achieved by loading a host dipole antenna with
   series capacitive gaps and shunt inductive strips, to form a two
   unit-cell NRI-TL loaded antenna. By modeling the right-handed dipole
   sections as biconical transmission lines, the rich dispersion properties
   of the NRI-TL structure can be exploited, while still creating an
   effective radiator. An equivalent circuit model of the NRI-TL antenna is
   developed, and it is shown that its performance agrees well with the
   results obtained using full-wave simulations. It is also shown that the
   resonant behavior of the antenna can be adjusted by changing its
   geometrical parameters, which in turn tune the loading parameters of
   each NRI-TL unit cell. As such, both dual-band and triband versions of
   the antenna are designed and fabricated. The dual-band version exhibits
   three distinct resonances at 1.15, 2.88, and 3.72 GHz, with measured -10
   dB bandwidths of 37 and 1150 MHz. The lowest resonance at 1.15 GHz
   corresponds to a 47\% reduction in the resonant frequency compared to
   that of a reference unloaded dipole antenna, which translates into a
   size miniaturization factor of approximately two. The antenna exhibits
   stable dipolar radiation patterns with a linear electric field
   polarization, and has a total size of 50 x 10 x 0.79 mm(3) or 0.19
   lambda(0) x 0.04 lambda(0) x 0.003 lambda(0) at 1.15 GHz. Throughout the
   operating bands the measured gain and radiation efficiency vary from
   0.11 to 3.26 dBi and 49.5\% to 95.6\%, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Recent advances in wireless sensing and communications have resulted in
   the need for antennas capable of high-directivity reconfigurable
   beamforming. Transmitarrays have been shown to be viable architectures,
   and two general design approaches have emerged: the layered-scatterer
   approach and the guided-wave approach. In this paper, we first
   investigate the beamforming capability of the layered-scatterer
   approach, generalizing the approach using impedance surfaces. Using
   Floquet mode analysis, we show that when a structure of this type is
   used to produce a pencil beam at angles greater than 20 degrees
   off-broadside, significant side-lobes are produced at large angles,
   regardless of the aperture size. Next, we present a fully reconfigurable
   6 x 6 transmitarray based on a guided-wave approach that experimentally
   demonstrates both pencil beam scanning over a 100 x 100-degree window as
   well as shaped-beam synthesis, over a 10 percent fractional bandwidth.
   The conclusion from our investigations into these two approaches is that
   for general beamforming applications, the guided-wave approach is
   superior, achieving good bandwidth, scanning range, insertion loss, and
   small structure thickness, with only moderate fabrication complexity.}},

   cells were deposited by suspension plasma spraying using a range of
   spray conditions and a variety of substrates, including finely
   structured porous stainless steel disks and cathode layers on stainless
   steel supports. Electrolyte permeability values and trends were found to
   be highly dependent on which substrate was used. The most gas-tight
   electrolyte coatings were those deposited directly on the porous metal
   disks. With this substrate, permeability was reduced by increasing the
   torch power and reducing the stand-off distance to produce dense coating
   microstructures. On the substrates with cathodes, electrolyte
   permeability was reduced by increasing the stand-off distance, which
   reduced the formation of segmentation cracks and regions of aligned and
   concentrated porosity. The formation mechanisms of the various
   permeability-related coating features are discussed and strategies for
   reducing permeability are presented. The dependences of electrolyte
   deposition efficiency and surface roughness on process conditions and
   substrate properties are also presented.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigates the performance of a new statistically driven
   acute ischemia detection algorithm that can process data from two
   bipolar cutaneous or subcutaneous leads. During a start-up phase, the
   algorithm processes electrocardiogram signals to determine a normal
   range of ST-segment deviation as a function of heart rate. The algorithm
   then generates upper and lower ST-deviation thresholds based on the
   dispersion of the baseline ST-deviation data. After the start-up phase,
   persistent ST-deviation that is beyond either the upper or lower
   thresholds results in detection of acute ischemia. To test the
   algorithm, we performed long-term (10 day) Holter monitoring in a
   control group of 14 subjects. We also performed Holter monitoring during
   balloon angioplasty, and for 2 days after surgery, in 30 subjects who
   underwent elective percutaneous coronary interventions ({''}PCI{''}). We
   determined the percentage of balloon inflations the algorithm detected
   without producing false positive detections within the control group
   10-day daily life data. The algorithm detected 17/17 LAD occlusions, 7/8
   LCX occlusions, and 8/9 RCA occlusions. Our results suggest that
   automatically generated, subject-specific, heart-rate dependent
   ST-deviation thresholds can detect PCI induced myocardial ischemia
   without resulting in false positive detections in a small control group.}},

Abstract = {{This technical note studies the distributed averaging problem over

   networks need not be column-stochastic, and the random process
   generating the update matrices need not be ergodic or i.i.d. It is then
   justified that the scheme achieves average consensus in the mean-square
   sense, which, in a special case, also implies averaging with probability
   one. A key technique to the justification is a matrix perturbation
   result, which describes the behavior of eigenvalues perturbed

Abstract = {{The decentralized robust servomechanism problem (DRSP) for colocated

   disturbances such that no ``spillover effects{''} occur, can be
   simultaneously handled using a fault-accommodating decentralized tuning
   PID error-feedback controller. Necessary and sufficient conditions for
   solvability of the DRSP for colocated LFSS under sensor and actuator
   failures are derived in our analysis. In the case when each control
   agent is single-input/single-output, the decentralized fault-tolerant
   controller becomes particularly simple to implement. Steady-state output
   matrices for failed outputs are computed, and are found to be

Abstract = {{An integrated catalytic hydrothermal reforming process for the
   production of hydrogen and methane from wet biomass feedstock is
   proposed where the process heat is provided by molten salts previously
   heated by solar energy. The simulated reactor consists of double tubes
   in which the reactants and the heat transfer fluid (i.e. molten salts)
   are concurrently pumped through the inner and the outer tubes,
   respectively. The first section of the reactor essentially serves as a
   preheater to increase the feed temperature to 20 K below the desired
   reaction temperature (i.e. 773 K), while the second section is comprised
   of a catalyst appropriate for the reforming of glycerol and water-gas
   shift reaction (e.g. Ru and Ni catalysts). The required energy for
   heating up the reactants to the final reaction temperature in the
   preheating section as well as the heat of reaction needed throughout the
   catalyst bed is provided by a co-currently fed molten salts mixture
   previously heated to 823 K in parabolic trough solar collectors. After
   heat recovery, the product mixture is cooled down to ambient temperature
   and depressurized to form liquid and gas phases. The gas products are
   subsequently separated into hydrogen, methane, and carbon dioxide or can
   be alternatively used for electricity generation using solid oxide fuel
   cells (SOFC). Glycerol was considered as a biomass model compound
   throughout this study, but the same methodology with minor changes can
   be applied to other oxygenated biomass compounds such as carbohydrates.
   The simulation results indicated that the degree of heat recovery has
   considerable effects on the process efficiency, the required parabolic
   mirror area, and the corresponding molten salt flow rate. Also, the
   higher the extent of the heat recovery, the smaller the dependence of
   the overall efficiency to the feed concentration. Copyright (c) 2012,

Abstract = {{The first instance of the solvent-free X-ray determined single-crystal
   structure of the oxygen-bridged boron subphthalocyanine dimer
   {[}mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2), C48H24B2N12O] is reported. Single crystals
   obtained by train sublimation were found to have mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2)
   organized into a C2/c space group. The crystal structure obtained by
   sublimation is of particular interest as it is highly symmetric and also
   of notably high density when compared with other BsubPc crystals. The
   acquisition of this crystal structure came about from the direct
   chemical synthesis of mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) followed by a work-up which
   culminated in obtaining the single crystals by sublimation. Several
   methods for the direct chemical synthesis of mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) were
   also investigated each using dichlorobenzene as the solvent. On
   standing, these reaction mixtures produced a crystal of the
   dichlorobenzene (DCB) solvate of mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2)
   {[}mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2)center dot 2DCB]. It is also reported that the
   conversion of bromo-boron subphthalocyanine (Br-BsubPc) to
   mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2) happens on train sublimation which resulted in the
   acquisition of a partially hydrated crystal {[}mu-oxo-(BsubPc)(2)center
   dot 0.25H(2)O].}},

Abstract = {{The oil-in-water emulsion formed during an aqueous extraction of yellow
   mustard seed flour was destabilized using isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in a
   four stage extraction process, with concurrent recovery of oil and water
   in separate phases. The emulsion was extracted using two different
   approaches: phase separation extraction (PSE) that used fresh IPA as the
   extraction solvent at each stage, and phase separation extraction with
   recycle (PSER) that reused the extracted water-rich phase, containing
   IPA, as the extraction solvent. Extraction processes by both approaches
   were modeled by the ternary liquid phase diagram of IPA, canola oil and
   water to characterize the extraction progress. PSER resulted in improved
   oil-water separation and IPA usage efficiency than PSE, but achieved
   only 84.0 \% oil recovery, compared to 92.3 \% by PSE. The ternary
   diagram of IPA, canola oil and water offered good approximation of the
   oil and water separation behavior of PSE and PSER by closely predicting
   the compositions of the separated phases; however, the weight ratio of
   the separated phases were not as closely predicted.}},

Abstract = {{Fault detection and diagnosis of gear transmission systems have
   attracted a lot of attention in recent years, but there are very few
   papers dealing with the early detection of shaft cracks. In this paper,
   a new methodology for predicting failures of a gear shaft system is
   presented. The time synchronous averaging (TSA) method is applied to the
   gear shaft vibration data, and the wavelet transform technique is then
   used to obtain quantitative indicators of gear shaft deterioration.
   System deterioration is modeled as a hidden, 3-state continuous-time
   homogeneous Markov process. States 0 and 1, which are not observable,
   represent healthy and unhealthy system conditions, respectively. Only
   the failure state 2 is assumed to be observable. The computed
   quantities, which are stochastically related to the system state, are
   chosen as the observation process in the hidden Markov modeling
   framework. The objective is to develop a method for optimally predicting
   impending system failures, which maximizes the long-run expected average
   system availability per unit time. Model parameters are estimated using
   the EM algorithm and an optimal Bayesian fault prediction scheme is
   proposed. The entire procedure is illustrated using real gear shaft
   vibration data. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Perfusion decellularisation is a promising technique in scaffold
   production for tissue engineering. The similarity of decellularised
   extracellular matrix to native matrix is attractive for the development
   of compatible and functional constructs for therapeutic applications.
   Here, whole organs were processed for tissue culture with an emphasis on
   production staging. Adult rat hearts were perfusion-decellularised on a
   modified chromatography system that facilitated the study of flow
   properties and effluent material to better understand the transport
   processes of decellularisation. Tracer pulse experiments confirmed gross
   integrity of the ECM, and suggested the accumulation of debris in tissue
   lumen at late decellularisation. The rate of protein loss matched visual
   indications of decellularisation, slowing to zero as the tissue achieved
   a uniform appearance. Decellularised hearts were cryopreserved for up to
   1 year before reconditioning including disinfection and soluble protein
   perfusion to remove adsorbed detergents. Canine blood outgrowth
   endothelial cells were seeded and cultured in a novel recellularisation
   apparatus with bubble-free aeration. After 9 days of culture, cells
   seeded in the lumen remained viable and exhibited well-attached
   morphology. This work presents approaches for the process analysis and
   non-destructive evaluation of decellularising tissue and demonstrates
   that cells may be successfully cultured on whole decellularised organs
   following long-term storage. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical

Abstract = {{Although potassium hydroxide (KOH) is known to be effective in
   generating highly porous activated carbons, the mechanism of KOH
   activation has not been well elucidated. To develop porosity in carbon,
   a high KOH/carbon mass ratio must be maintained. Consequently, KOH, as
   the activating agent, represents a major part of the cost of the
   activation process. Focusing on the mechanism, particularly the
   activation products, the present work attempted to establish the
   technical feasibility of recycling KOH. Experiments revealed that the
   major products of KOH activation at 600900 degrees C are metallic K,
   K2CO3, CO and H-2, which is supported by thermodynamic analysis. The
   overall reaction may be written as 6KOH + 4C = K2CO + 4K + 3H(2) + 3CO.
   At temperatures over 900 degrees C, K2CO3 becomes unstable and
   participates in activation reactions with carbon; a more suitable
   overall reaction would be KOH + C = CO + K + 0.5H(2). As potassium ion
   is reduced to metallic K which is readily converted into KOH and
   hydrogen gas upon reacting with water, KOH recycling is feasible. The
   reuse of KOH in chemical activation could substantially reduce the cost
   of activation process. (c) 2011 Canadian Society for Chemical

Abstract = {{A family 15 carbohydrate esterase (CE15) from the white-rot
   basidiomycete, Phanerochaete carnosa (PcGCE), was transformed into
   Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 and was expressed from the constitutive
   cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter. Like other CE15 enzymes, PcGCE
   hydrolyzed methyl-4-O-methyl-d-glucopyranuronate and could target ester
   linkages that contribute to lignincarbohydrate complexes that form in
   plant cell walls. Three independently transformed Arabidopsis lines were
   evaluated in terms of nine morphometric parameters, total sugar and
   lignin composition, cell wall anatomy, enzymatic saccharification and
   xylan extractability. The transgenic lines consistently displayed a
   leaf-yellowing phenotype, as well as reduced glucose and xylose content
   by as much as 30\% and 35\%, respectively. Histological analysis
   revealed 50\% reduction in cell wall thickness in the interfascicular
   fibres of transgenic plants, and FT-IR microspectroscopy of
   interfascicular fibre walls indicated reduction in lignin cross-linking
   in plants overexpressing PcGCE. Notably, these characteristics could be
   correlated with improved xylose recovery in transgenic plants, up to
   15\%. The current analysis represents the first example whereby a fungal
   glucuronoyl esterase is expressed in Arabidopsis and shows that the
   promotion of glucuronoyl esterase activity in plants can alter the
   extent of intermolecular cross-linking within plant cell walls.}},

Abstract = {{The recent growing interest for indoor Location-Based Services (LBSs)
   has created a need for more accurate and real-time indoor positioning
   solutions. The sparse nature of location finding makes the theory of
   Compressive Sensing (CS) desirable for accurate indoor positioning using
   Received Signal Strength (RSS) from Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
   Access Points (APs). We propose an accurate RSS-based indoor positioning
   system using the theory of compressive sensing, which is a method to
   recover sparse signals from a small number of noisy measurements by
   solving an l(1)-minimization problem. Our location estimator consists of
   a coarse localizer, where the RSS is compared to a number of clusters to
   detect in which cluster the node is located, followed by a fine
   localization step, using the theory of compressive sensing, to further
   refine the location estimation. We have investigated different coarse
   localization schemes and AP selection approaches to increase the
   accuracy. We also show that the CS theory can be used to reconstruct the
   RSS radio map from measurements at only a small number of fingerprints,
   reducing the number of measurements significantly. We have implemented
   the proposed system on a WiFi-integrated mobile device and have
   evaluated the performance. Experimental results indicate that the
   proposed system leads to substantial improvement on localization
   accuracy and complexity over the widely used traditional fingerprinting
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Current surgical treatments for degenerative intervertebral disc disease
   do not restore full normal spinal movement. Tissue engineering a
   functional disc replacement may be one way to circumvent this
   limitation, but will require an integration of the different tissues
   making up the disc for this approach to be successful. Hence, an
   in-depth characterization of the native tissue interfaces, including
   annulus insertion into bone is necessary, as knowledge of this interface
   is limited. The objective of this study was to characterize the annulus
   fibrosusvertebral bone (AFVB) interface in immature (69 months old) and
   mature (1824 months old) bovine discs, as well as to define these
   structures for normal adult human (22 and 45 years old) discs.
   Histological assessment showed that collagen fibers in the inner
   annulus, which are predominantly type II collagen, all appear to insert
   into the mineralized endplate zone. In contrast, some of the collagen
   fibers of the outer annulus, predominantly type I collagen, insert into
   this endplate, while other fibers curve laterally, at an similar to 90
   degrees angle, to the outer aspect of the bone, and merge with the
   periosteum. This is seen in both human and bovine discs. Where the AF
   inserts into the calcified zone of the AFVB interface, it passes through
   a chondroid region, rich in type II collagen and proteoglycans. Annulus
   cells (elongated cells that are not surrounded by proteoglycans) are
   present at this interface. This cartilage zone is evident in both human
   and bovine discs. Type X collagen and alkaline phosphatase are localized
   to the interface region. Age-associated differences in bovine spines are
   observed when examining the interface thickness and the matrix
   composition of the cartilaginous endplate, as well as the thickness of
   the mineralized endplate. These findings will assist with the design of
   the AFVB interface in the tissue engineered disc.}},

Abstract = {{Mobile robots are currently being developed to help rescue workers in
   urban disaster environments to search for survivors. Our research
   focuses on developing robust 3-D sensors that can be used in robotic
   rescue missions to map these unknown cluttered environments and
   determine the locations of victims. This paper presents the development
   of a new active 3-D sensory system for robotic search and rescue in
   unknown cluttered urban disaster environments. The sensory system can
   provide high resolution 2-D and 3-D information of a cluttered scene
   that can be used by a robot operator for real-time viewing as well as to
   develop a 3-D map of the disaster scene. The main advantage of the
   proposed sensory system is its robustness to cluttered, and dark and
   dimly lit environments found in disaster areas. Experimental results are
   presented to verify the performance of the sensory system in obtaining
   3-D sensory information of rubble piles in Urban Search and Rescue like
   environments as well as the potential use of the sensor for 3-D mapping
   applications in these unknown environments.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a small-size low-power portable vector display
   system. The display system uses a micromirror which consists of a simple
   two-thin-film structure and is fabricated using a surface-micromachining
   process, i.e., Polysilicon Multi User MEMS Processes. The micromirror
   exhibits rotational motion around two axes as well as translational
   motion through four repulsive-force electrostatic actuating units. The
   micromirror is free of the ``pull-in{''} effect which is associated with
   conventional micro electrostatic actuators. The micromirror is operated
   in a nonresonant mode and is capable of static positioning. Measured
   data show that the micromirror can achieve an optical scanning angle of
   +/- 2.5 degrees in each axis. The measured bandwidth (-3 dB) for each
   driving unit is 2000 Hz operating at a sinusoidal input voltage of 0-200
   V. The settling times of the actuating unit are 2.75 and 3.32 ms with
   overshoots of 5\% and 48\% for step inputs of 200 to 0 V and 0 to 200 V,
   respectively. The portable vector display system is developed through
   integrating the micromirror, a laser source, the optics, and a
   microcontroller and is shown to be very effective in displaying complex
   geometries. Open-loop control methods using lookup table searching, spot
   dwelling, and scan speed control were developed to control the
   integrated portable device.}},

Abstract = {{Stereocomplex formation between poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and
   poly(D-lactic acid) (PDLA) in the melt state was investigated. Blends
   with up to 5\% PDLA were prepared via melt-blending and characterized by
   rheological, calorimetric, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and optical
   microscopy techniques. Kinetic studies suggest that the stereocomplex
   formation half-time (t(1/2)) is in the range of 5-7 min. The nucleating
   role of the stereocomplex for PLA homocrystallization was demonstrated
   in XRD experiment and in optical microscopy observations through an
   increase in the spherulite density as well as the growth of a
   transcrystalline layer on stereocomplex spherulites. More interestingly,
   a dual crystalline morphology for PLA stereocomplex comprising a
   spherulitic and a network structure was revealed by optical microscopy
   observations. This complex morphology was associated to a double
   stereocomplex melting peak behavior observed after isothermal
   crystallization in DSC as well as to a huge viscosity increase observed
   in the presence of a small concentration of stereocomplex in a PLLA
   melt. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study the existence of absolutely maximally entangled (AME) states in
   quantum mechanics and its applications to quantum information. AME
   states are characterized by being maximally entangled for all
   bipartitions of the system and exhibit genuine multipartite
   entanglement. With such states, we present a parallel teleportation
   protocol which teleports multiple quantum states between groups of
   senders and receivers. The notable features of this protocol are that
   (i) the partition into senders and receivers can be chosen after the
   state has been distributed, and (ii) one group has to perform joint
   quantum operations while the parties of the other group only have to act
   locally on their system. We also prove the equivalence between pure
   state quantum secret sharing schemes and AME states with an even number
   of parties.}},

Abstract = {{We report on the fabrication of high-fidelity inverted-pyramids in
   crystalline silicon (c-Si) at the 1 mu m scale through the selective
   removal of a silicon nitride (SiNx) hard-mask with a 522 nm femtosecond
   (fs) laser and subsequent alkaline potassium hydroxide (KOH) etching.
   Through a series of systematic experiments on a range of hard-mask
   thicknesses, the use of 20 nm thick SiNx film yielded a 0.6 mu m
   diameter laser-ejected aperture in the hard-mask at a single pulse
   fluence of 0.45 J cm(-2), resulting in 1 mu m wide inverted-pyramid
   structure in c-Si after KOH etching. Anisotropic KOH etching of the
   partially amorphized c-Si underlying the fs-laser patterned hard mask
   was found to render clean (111) planes of c-Si. An array of
   inverted-pyramids on c-Si surfaces as large as 4 cm(2) was produced with
   a defect density of less than 1 in 10(4). This facile, non-contact, and
   cleanroom-independent technique serves a variety of applications
   including anti-reflective texturing of thin c-Si for photovoltaics,
   wafer marking, labeling, and fabrication of microfluidic and optical
   devices or laboratories on silicon wafers. (C) 2012 American Institute

Abstract = {{Capitalizing on the benefits of microscale segmented flows, e.g.,
   enhanced mixing and reduced sample dispersion, so far requires
   specialist training and accommodating a few experimental inconveniences.
   For instance, microscale gas-liquid flows in many current setups take at
   least 10 min to stabilize and iterative manual adjustments are needed to
   achieve or maintain desired mixing or residence times. Here, we report a
   cruise control strategy that overcomes these limitations and allows
   microscale gas-liquid (bubble) and liquid-liquid (droplet) flow
   conditions to be rapidly ``adjusted{''} and maintained. Using this
   strategy we consistently establish bubble and droplet flows with
   dispersed phase (plug) velocities of 5-300 mm s(-1) plug lengths of
   0.6-5 mm and continuous phase (slug) lengths of 0.5-3 mm. The mixing
   times (1-5 s), mass transfer times (33-250 ms) and residence times
   (3-300 s) can therefore be directly imposed by dynamically controlling
   the supply of the dispersed and the continuous liquids either from
   external pumps or from local pressurized reservoirs. In the latter case,
   no chip-external pumps, liquid-perfused tubes or valves are necessary
   while unwanted dead volumes are significantly reduced.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives This study investigated whether cytokine enhancement of a
   biodegradable patch could restore cardiac function after surgical
   ventricular restoration (SVR) even when seeded with cells from old
   donors.
   Background SVR can partially restore heart size and improve function
   late after an extensive anterior myocardial infarction. However, 2
   limitations include the stiff synthetic patch used and the limited
   healing of the infarct scar in aged patients.
   Methods We covalently immobilized 2 proangiogenic cytokines (vascular
   endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor) onto
   porous collagen scaffolds. We seeded human mesenchymal stromal cells
   from young (50.0 +/- 8.0 years, N = 4) or old (74.5 +/- 7.4 years, N =
   4) donors into the scaffolds, with or without growth factors. The
   patches were characterized and used for SVR in a rat model of myocardial
   infarction. Cardiac function was assessed.
   Results In vitro results showed that cells from old donors grew slower
   in the scaffolds. However, the presence of cytokines modulated the
   aging-related p16 gene and enhanced cell proliferation, converting the
   old cell phenotype to a young phenotype. In vivo studies showed that 28
   days after SVR, patches seeded with cells from old donors did not induce
   functional recovery as well as patches seeded with young cells. However,
   cytokine-enhanced patches seeded with old cells exhibited preserved
   patch area, prolonged cell survival, and augmented angiogenesis, and
   rats implanted with these patches had better cardiac function. The patch
   became an elastic tissue, and the old cells were rejuvenated.
   Conclusions This sustained-release, cytokine-conjugated system provides
   a promising platform for engineering myocardial tissue for aged patients
   with heart failure. (J Am Coll Cardiol 2012;60:2237-49) (C) 2012 by the

Abstract = {{This paper presents the formulation and application of a multiscale
   methodology that couples three domains using a finite element framework.
   The proposed method efficiently models atomistic systems by decomposing
   the system into continuum, bridging, and atomistic domains. The
   atomistic and bridging domains are solved using a combined finite
   elementmolecular mechanics simulation where the system is discretized
   into atom/nodal centric elements based on the atomic scale finite
   element method. Coupling between the atomistic domain and continuum
   domain is performed through the bridging cells, which contain locally
   formulated atoms whose displacements are mapped to the nodes of the
   bridging cell elements. The method implements a temperature-dependent
   potential for finite temperature simulations. Validation and
   demonstration of the methodology are provided through three case
   studies: displacement in a one-dimensional chain, stress around
   nanoscale voids, and fracture. From these studies differences between
   multiscale and fully atomistic simulations were very small with the
   simulation time of the proposed methodology being approximately a tenth
   of the time of the fully atomistic model. Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley

Abstract = {{Plasmonic polymers present an interesting concept that builds on the
   analogy between molecular polymers and linear chains of strongly
   interacting metal nanoparticles. Ensemble averaged optical properties of
   plasmonic polymers are strongly influenced by their structure. In the
   present work, we formed plasmonic polymers by using solution based
   assembly of gold nanorods (NRs) end tethered with photoactive
   macromolecular tethers. By using postassembly ligand
   photo-cross-linking, we established a method to arrest NR polymer growth
   after a particular self-assembly time, and in this manner, using
   kinetics of step-growth polymerization, we achieved control over the
   average degree of polymerization of plasmonic polymers.
   Photo-cross-linking of ligands also enabled control over the
   internanorod distance and resulted in the increased rigidity of NR
   chains. These results, along with a higher structural integrity of NR
   chains, can be utilized in plasmonic nanostructure engineering and
   facilitate advanced applications of plasmonic polymers in sensing and

Abstract = {{Nanomaterials are becoming increasingly widespread in consumer
   technologies, but there is global concern about the toxicity of
   nanomaterials to humans and the environment as they move rapidly from
   the research laboratory to the market place. With this in mind, it makes
   sense to intensify the nanochemistry community's global research effort
   on the synthesis and study of nanoparticles that are purportedly green.
   One potentially green nanoparticle that seems to be a most promising
   candidate in this context is silicon, whose appealing optical,
   optoelectronic, photonic, and biomedical attributes are recently gaining
   much attention. In this paper, we outline some of our recent
   contributions to the development of the growing field of silicon
   nanocrystals (ncSi) in order to stress the importance of continued study
   of ncSi as a green alternative to the archetypal semiconductor
   nanocrystals like CdSe, InAs, and PbS. While a variety of developments
   in synthetic methods, characterization techniques, and applications have
   been reported in recent years, the ability to prepare colloidally-stable
   monodisperse ncSi samples may prove to have the largest impact on the
   field, as it opens the door to study and access the tunable
   size-dependent properties of ncSi. Here, we summarize our recent
   contributions in size-separation methods to achieve monodisperse
   samples, the characterization of size-dependant property trends, the
   development of ncSi applications, and their potential impact on the
   promising future of ncSi.}},

Abstract = {{We demonstrate a microfluidic approach to the production of block
   copolymer vesicles via flow directed self assembly in a segmented
   gas-liquid device. Chemical conditions that favor spherical micelles in
   the bulk are found to yield a nearly pure population of vesicles on a
   chip-a transformation of two full morphological steps-because of a
   coalescence mechanism enabled by high shear. The production of polymeric
   vesicles via top-down control in a microfluidic device enables new
   processing routes to applications including drug delivery formulations

Title = {{Effects of nonlinear interfacial kinetics and interfacial thermal
   resistance in planar solidification}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2012}},
Volume = {{86}},

Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Large temperature discontinuities were recently measured at a
   solid-liquid interface during heat transport processes. These
   observations suggest that when heat flows between two phases, the
   interface is not well characterized by assuming thermal equilibrium.
   This can be of importance in rapid solidification processes. In this
   paper we consider a planar front model that solidifies from its
   undercooled melt. We use a generalized interfacial boundary condition
   that includes nonlinear kinetic effects and allows for a temperature
   discontinuity. The effects of the new boundary condition on the
   solidification rates and the temperature profile are reported as a
   function of time. Our analysis shows that the undercooling regime where
   constant phase-front velocities are observed at steady states
   (traveling-wave solutions) are unaffected by the new boundary
   conditions. These solutions arise when the Stephan number is larger than
   1. On the other hand, the solidification rates and the steady-state
   velocities are greatly affected by the assumed conditions at the
   interface. Incorporation of an interface thermal resistance, or Kapitza
   resistance, generates temperature discontinuities at the interface,
   leads to reduced solidification rates and the Mullins-Sekerka
   instability arises at longer wavelengths deformation of the planar
   front.}},

Abstract = {{Using oil-sands petroleum coke as the raw material and sulfur dioxide as
   the activating agent at 700 degrees C, the process of pore development
   in dense carbonaceous materials was studied. The time dependence of
   porosity was established from measured values of specific surface area
   (SSA), which could not be explained using conventional porous layer
   theories. Incorporating the Random Pore Model with measurements of
   particle size and porous layer thickness, a model was developed based on
   the existence of a porous layer of constant thickness. The model was
   found to accurately reproduce experimental time dependence of SSA. The
   results confirm a constant thickness of the porous layer for the
   activation conditions studied, which results from competing effects of
   carbon gasification reaction and penetration of the activating agent
   into the carbon particle interior. The model predicts a higher
   achievable SSA for a greater constant porous layer thickness, smaller
   initial particle size, and lower inorganic ash content. This model was
   found to be useful in predicting the maximum porous layer thickness of a
   dense material undergoing activation or gasification using only measured
   values of SSA, pore size distribution, and particle size as inputs.}},

Number = {{21}},
Pages = {{4557-4568}},

Abstract = {{Transition metal oxides are capable of a wide range of work functions.
   This quality allows them to be used in many applications that involve
   charge transfer with adsorbed molecules, for example as heterogeneous
   catalysts, as charge-injection layers in organic electronics, and as
   electrodes in fuel cells. Chemical and structural factors can alter
   transition-metal oxide work functions, often making their work functions
   difficult to control. Little is known about the effects of the cation
   oxidation state and point defects on the oxide work function. It is
   necessary to understand how such chemical and structural factors affect
   work functions in order to controllably tune transition metal oxides for
   desired applications. Here, a correlation between the oxide work
   function and cation oxidation state is demonstrated. This correlation is
   attributed to the change in cation electronegativity with oxidation
   state. A model is presented that relates the work function to the oxygen
   deficiency for d(0) oxides in the limit of dilute oxygen vacancies. It
   is proposed that the rapid initial decrease in work function, observed
   for d(0) oxides, is caused by an increase in the density of donor-like
   defect states. It is also shown that oxides tend to have decreased work
   functions near a metal/metal-oxide interface as a consequence of the
   relationship between defects and work function. These insights provide
   guidelines for tuning transition metal oxide work functions.}},

Abstract = {{Further insight toward the complex association and dissociation events

   Three-color fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (3C-FCCS) has
   been shown to track assemblies of three spectrally labeled species in
   solution. Here, we clearly show that 3C-FCCS is capable of
   distinguishing beads barcoded with quantum dots from free quantum dots
   in the background despite the 800-to-1 difference in concentration of
   these two components. The validation of this spectroscopic technique in
   combination with the development of barcode labels would enable one to
   start to investigate complex association and dissociation kinetics of
   macromolecules and nanomaterials during the assembly process.}},

   Spread codes are a family of optimal codes with maximal minimum

   ((n - k)k(3)) operations over an extension field F(q)k. Our algorithm is
   more efficient than the previous ones in the literature, when the
   dimension k of the codewords is small with respect to n. The decoding
   algorithm takes advantage of the algebraic structure of the code, and it
   uses original results on minors of a matrix and on the factorization of

Abstract = {{Molecular optical imaging is a widespread technique for interrogating
   molecular events in living subjects. However, current approaches
   preclude long-term, continuous measurements in awake, mobile subjects, a
   strategy crucial in several medical conditions. Consequently, we
   designed a novel, lightweight miniature biosensor for in vivo continuous
   optical sensing. The biosensor contains an enclosed vertical-cavity
   surface-emitting semiconductor laser and an adjacent pair of
   near-infrared optically filtered detectors. We employed two sensors
   (dual sensing) to simultaneously interrogate normal and diseased tumor
   sites. Having established the sensors are precise with phantom and in
   vivo studies, we performed dual, continuous sensing in tumor (human
   glioblastoma cells) bearing mice using the targeted molecular probe
   cRGD-Cy5.5, which targets alpha(V)beta(3) cell surface integrins in both
   tumor neovasculature and tumor. The sensors capture the dynamic
   time-activity curve of the targeted molecular probe. The average tumor
   to background ratio after signal calibration for cRGD-Cy5.5 injection is
   approximately 2.43 +/- 0.95 at 1 h and 3.64 +/- 1.38 at 2 h (N = 5
   mice), consistent with data obtained with a cooled charge coupled device
   camera. We conclude that our novel, portable, precise biosensor can be
   used to evaluate both kinetics and steady state levels of molecular
   probes in various disease applications. (C)2012 Society of Photo-Optical

   computer vision techniques have the potential to automate equipment
   monitoring tasks. This paper presents research in the evaluation of
   combinations of existing object recognition and background subtraction
   algorithms to recognize off-highway dump trucks in noisy video streams
   containing other active machines. Two detection algorithms, namely,
   Haar-histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and Blob-HOG, are presented
   and evaluated for their ability to recognize dump trucks in videos as
   measured by both effectiveness and timeliness. The results of this study
   can help practitioners select a suitable approach to recognize such
   equipment in videos for real-time applications such as productivity
   measurement, performance control, and proactive work-zone safety.

Abstract = {{The central basin of Lake Erie has chronic hypoxia that is exacerbated
   by strong seasonal temperature stratification near the lake bed. A
   computational study was conducted to determine the feasibility of
   mechanically mixing the water column by using a bubble plume system to
   reduce stratification, thus facilitating vertical transport of oxygen.
   The most efficient design delivered an air flow rate of 0.4-0.5 m(3)
   s(-1) through 40-50 non-interacting plumes, which only mix the
   watercolumn during the late summer hypoxic events. The optimal
   efficiency was computed using a new metric, which neglects changes in
   stratification resulting from meteorologically induced mixing, relative
   to those from artificial mixing. DOI:

Abstract = {{A handful of early breakthroughs in photoacoustic science and
   engineering since its modern-day (scientific) renaissance in the 1970s
   has defined directions in the development of the photoacoustic,
   photothermal, and diffusion-wave fields in the past 40 years that have
   shaped modern day developments and have led to an impressive range of
   vibrant and unique technologies in the third millennium (technological
   renaissance). A power-point presentation on the ICPPP-16 opening plenary
   talk focuses on the historical roots of what I perceive to be some of
   today's most successful and unique technologies, while readily
   acknowledging the impossibility to be all inclusive. It can be found
   under the url:
   http://cadift.mie.utoronto.ca/History\_of\_Photoacoustics-Photothermics.
   ppt. The thematic areas in question include historical reviews selected
   among the following topics: Piezoelectric photoacoustic microscopy (PAM)
   which, along with early gas-phase PA spectroscopic studies of
   biomaterials such as blood haemoglobin and progress in the physics of
   photon diffusion waves, has led to the modern-day explosion in
   biomedical photoacoustic imaging technologies with future trends for
   photoacoustic and ultrasound co-registered imagers; Thermoreflectance,
   piezoelectric, and gas-phase PA imaging of semiconductors which, along
   with developments in photocarrier diffusion wave physics, led to
   photocarrier radiometry, nanolayer diagnostics, carrierographic imaging
   of optoelectronic materials, and devices with industrial trends in solar
   cell inspection and control; Photoacoustic gas-phase and infrared
   radiometric probing and scanning imaging NDE which led to lock-in
   thermography and have spawned industrial and biomedical technologies;
   Thermal-wave interferometry and the quest for thermal coherence which
   led to thermal-wave cavities, the thermal-wave radar, and derivative
   depth profiling technologies, and, very recently, thermal coherence
   tomography. This review is meant to be a growing public record of work
   in progress, with new materials in the given thematic areas and other
   thematic areas being added as more information on the rich history of
   the field becomes available. Direct inputs to the author by the broader
   photoacoustic, photothermal, and diffusion-wave community are solicited
   and strongly encouraged to ensure that all landmark and seminal work
   that shaped the state of the science and art in the field receives fair
   and deserving exposure and the historical review becomes truly
   representative and comprehensive.}},

   practical application of the mathematical correlation processing method

   sources. Image comparison with ultrasound (US) modality was investigated
   to see the complementarity between the two techniques. The obtained

   resolution. Using matched filter principles, a methodology is proposed
   enabling these parabolic diffusion-wave energy fields to exhibit energy

   improves the axial resolution, but also allows for deconvolution of
   individual responses of superposed axially discrete sources, opening a
   new field of depth-resolved subsurface thermal coherence tomography
   using diffusion waves. The depth-resolved nature of the developed
   methodology is verified through experiments carried out on phantoms and

   depends on the free-photocarrier diffusion-wave density, the spatial
   resolution is a function of modulation frequency, and the contrast is
   due to the spatial distribution of important parameters influencing the
   efficiency of the solar cell, such as base recombination lifetime.
   High-spatial-resolution and high-frequency carrierographic images have
   been obtained using a HDCG method. The relationship between the LICG
   amplitude and the solar cell terminal photovoltage under an external
   load was investigated. The influence of surface recombination velocities
