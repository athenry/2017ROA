Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to show and discuss the effects of the gold
   nanoparticle (Au-NPs) concentration inside a tissue phantom using a
   combined system of photoacoustics (PA) and optical beam deflection and
   their applications particularly to photoacoustic imaging. It was found
   that the PA signal from aggregated Au nanoparticles is significantly
   enhanced. The stock concentration of 100 nm Au-NPs was particles/mL from
   which three samples with 30 \%, 70 \%, and 90 \% concentration were
   prepared using polyvinyl chloride-plastisol. Each sample was then
   irradiated across a line scan using a 10 ns pulsed Q-switched Nd:YAG
   laser at a 1 Hz repetition rate and so that no physical ablation was
   observed. The corresponding photoacoustic pressure was found to
   approximately cover a range between 10 kPa and 51 kPa. This corresponds
   to approximately 130 pJ to 315 pJ of acoustic energy radiated by Au-NPs
   into the tissue. The maximal efficacy of the transformation of optical
   energy into thermal energy was . Time-resolved photoacoustic deflection
   was also used to monitor the laser-interaction process. The results
   clearly indicated that (i) the photoacoustic signal amplitude varies in
   a given sample as a result of the non-uniform concentration distribution
   of embedded Au-NPs; (ii) an increase of the concentration increased the
   signal amplitude linearly; and (iii) at higher nanoparticle
   concentrations, the probe deflection was found to increase due to a
   steeper thermoelastic gradient as a result of a higher absorption by
   particle agglomerates and particle size-dependent dispersions.}},

Abstract = {{Photocarrier radiometry (PCR) with 355 nm laser excitation was used for
   the study of c-Si covered with intrinsic thin hydrogenated amorphous Si
   (i-a-Si:H) on one, or both, sides, with thicknesses ranging from 10 nm
   to 90 nm. Short wavelength excitation allows one to resolve the
   contribution of the upper i-a-S layer to the PCR signal due to the very
   small absorption depth (tens of nm) of the excitation beam. As a result,
   fundamental transport parameters of the composite structure can be
   evaluated from the PCR frequency dependence. A theoretical model has
   been developed to describe the diffuse carrier density wave (CDW) in
   this two-layer system. The model of the one-dimensional CDW fields for
   composite electronic solids involves front, interface, and back surface
   recombination velocities, the diffusion coefficient, recombination
   lifetimes in the upper and lower layers, and the unoccupied trap density
   at the interface. Simulations of the transport parameter influence on
   the PCR signal were performed, and the theoretical model was able to
   describe the experimental data accurately, therefore, making it possible
   to evaluate the transport parameters of i-a-Si:H and c-Si as well as to

   super-bandgap illumination laser beams is introduced in both

   carrierographic images of the wafer up to 400 Hz modulation frequency
   are presented. To overcome the frame rate and exposure time limitations
   of the camera, a heterodyne method is employed for high-frequency
   carrierographic imaging which results in high-resolution near-subsurface
   information. The feasibility of the method is guaranteed by the typical
   superlinearity behavior of photoluminescence, which allows one to
   construct a slow enough beat frequency component from nonlinear mixing
   of two high frequencies. Intensity-scan measurements were carried out
   with a conventional single-element InGaAs detector photocarrier
   radiometry system, and the nonlinearity exponent of the wafer was found
   to be around 1.7. Heterodyne images of the wafer up to 4 kHz have been
   obtained and qualitatively analyzed. With the help of the complementary

Abstract = {{In the field of medical diagnostics, biomedical photoacoustics (PA) is a
   non-invasive hybrid optical-ultrasonic imaging modality. Due to the
   unique hybrid capability of optical and acoustic imaging, PA imaging has
   risen to the frontiers of medical diagnostic procedures such as human
   breast cancer detection. While conventional PA imaging has been mainly
   carried out by a high-power pulsed laser, an alternative technology, the
   frequency domain biophotoacoustic radar (FD-PAR) is under intensive
   development. It utilizes a continuous wave optical source with the laser
   intensity modulated by a frequency-swept waveform for acoustic wave
   generation. The small amplitude of the generated acoustic wave is
   significantly compensated by increased signal-to-noise ratio (several
   orders of magnitude) using matched-filter and pulse compression
   correlation processing in a manner similar to radar systems. The current
   study introduces the theory of a novel FD-PAR modality for
   ultra-sensitive characterization of functional information for breast
   cancer imaging. The newly developed theory of wavelength-modulated
   differential PA spectroscopy (WM-DPAS) detection has been introduced to
   address angiogenesis and hypoxia monitoring, two well-known benchmarks
   of breast tumor formation. Based on the WM-DPAS theory, this modality
   efficiently suppresses background absorptions and is expected to detect
   very small changes in total hemoglobin concentration and oxygenation
   levels, thereby identifying pre-malignant tumors before they are
   anatomically apparent. An experimental system design for the WM-DPAS is
   presented and preliminary single-ended laser experimental results were
   obtained and compared to a limiting case of the developed theoretical
   formalism.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) have attracted significant interest for
   applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices such as
   photodetectors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. However, a poor
   understanding of charge transport in these nanocrystalline films hinders
   their practical applications. The photocarrier radiometry (PCR)
   technique, a frequency-domain photoluminescence method spectrally gated
   for radiative recombination photon emissions and exclusion of thermal
   infrared photons, has been applied to a coupled PbS CQD thin film with
   inter-dot spacing of 0.5 nm to 1 nm for the analysis of charge transport
   properties. As the nanoparticle bandgap depends on the size of the
   quantum dots, polydispersity of the CQD thin film causes bandgap
   variability leading to photoexcited carrier (exciton) decay lifetime
   broadening and temperature dependence. The carrier transport mechanisms
   of QDs are quite different from bulk semiconductors, so the conventional
   carrier-diffusion wave-based PCR theory was modified into a
   non-diffusive limit model. A developed variational discrete lifetime
   reconstruction approach was used to analyze PCR frequency scans under
   two optical excitation modes: a modulated laser source without, and
   with, an additional continuous laser source. Using this model, the CQD
   mean lifetime values were found and variational discrete lifetime
   spectra were reconstructed.}},

Title = {{Catalytic Consequences of Chemisorbed Oxygen during Methanol Oxidative
   Dehydrogenation on Pd Clusters}},
Journal = {{ACS CATALYSIS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{3375-3386}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{Surface oxygen contents and thermodynamic activities of nanosized Pd
   clusters and their connection to the reactivities for methanol oxidative
   dehydrogenation are established from rate measurements in the
   kinetically controlled regime and oxygen uptake studies at chemical
   equilibrium. First-order rate coefficients for methanol oxidative
   dehydrogenation (turnover rates divided by CH3OH pressure) are
   single-valued functions of the oxygen-to-methanol ratio in the
   contacting gas phase because this ratio determines the oxygen coverages,
   the relative abundance of ? chemisorbed oxygen and unoccupied Pd sites,
   and in turn, the identities of the kinetically relevant steps at Pd
   cluster surfaces. As the oxygen-to-methanol ratio increases, the most
   abundant surface intermediates on Pd dusters vary from uncovered to
   saturated with chemisorbed oxygen; in response to this shift in
   coverages, the kinetically relevant step concomitantly varies from
   oxygen dissociation, to CH3OH activation on oxygen adatom and oxygen
   vacancy pairs (O{*}-{*}), and then to CH3OH activation on oxygen adatorn
   pairs (O{*}-O{*}), during which the first order rate coefficients
   initially increase and then reach a maximum value before decreasing to a
   constant value that does not vary with the oxygen-to-methanol ratio.
   These dependencies reflect the dual catalytic functionality of
   chemisorbed oxygen, first promoting the methanol conversion as the
   oxygen coverages increase and then inhibiting the reaction at near O{*}
   saturation, as oxygen displaces the unoccupied Pd sites, thus removing
   the O{*}-{*} centers while replacing them with less reactive O{*}-O{*}
   centers for CH3OH activation. Methanol acts as a surface oxygen
   scavenger that reduces the oxygen chemical potential at Pd cluster
   surfaces during its catalytic turnovers The oxygen scavenging step by
   methanol increases with temperature to a larger extent than the O-2
   activation step. As a result of more effective oxygen removal (by
   reactions) at higher temperatures, the critical oxygen coverage required
   for the transition of regimes from {*}-{*} to O{*}-{*} as the
   predominant surface sites occurs at higher oxygen-to-methanol ratios.
   Larger Pd clusters are more reactive for methanol oxidative
   dehydrogenation than smaller dusters in all regimes because duster
   dimension influences the relative abundance of chemisorbed oxygen and
   unoccupied Pd sites, the oxygen binding strengths, and their
   reactivities. The direct connection of firstorder rate coefficient and
   oxidant-to-reductant ratio appears to be general for methanol oxidative
   dehydrogenation on other transition metals and for oxidation catalysis,
   for which the reductant scavenges the chemisorbed oxygen effectively,
   thus dictating their coverages and thermodynamic activities.}},

Abstract = {{Patient-specific flow rates are rarely available for image-based
   computational fluid dynamics models. Instead, flow rates are often
   assumed to scale according to the diameters of the arteries of interest.
   Our goal was to determine how choice of inlet location and scaling law
   affect such model-based estimation of inflow rates. We focused on 37
   internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm cases from the Aneurisk cohort.
   An average ICA flow rate of 245 mL min(-1) was assumed from the
   literature, and then rescaled for each case according to its inlet
   diameter squared (assuming a fixed velocity) or cubed (assuming a fixed
   wall shear stress). Scaling was based on diameters measured at various
   consistent anatomical locations along the models. Choice of location
   introduced a modest 17\% average uncertainty in model-based flow rate,
   but within individual cases estimated flow rates could vary by > 100 mL
   min(-1). A square law was found to be more consistent with physiological
   flow rates than a cube law. Although impact of parent artery truncation
   on downstream flow patterns is well studied, our study highlights a more
   insidious and potentially equal impact of truncation site and scaling
   law on the uncertainty of assumed inlet flow rates and thus,
   potentially, downstream flow patterns.}},

Title = {{Methadone Contributes to N-Nitrosodimethylamine Formation in Surface
   Waters and Wastewaters during Chloramination}},
Journal = {{ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{2}},
Number = {{6}},
Pages = {{151-157}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{N-Nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) is a probable human carcinogen that forms
   in drinking water as a disinfection byproduct. Several specific
   precursor chemicals present during chloramination are known but cannot
   account for the total observed NDMA formation potential (FP) in drinking
   waters. We discovered a pharmaceutical precursor of NDMA with high FP
   using a liquid chromatography/quadrupole/time-of-flight mass
   spectrometry (LC/QTOF-MS) screening procedure. The pharmaceutical
   methadone, which is used to mitigate heroin withdrawal symptoms and is
   also prescribed for chronic pain, contains a dimethylisopropylamine
   functional group that reacts to form large amounts of NDMA upon
   chloramination. In this study, methadone had a molar NDMA yield ranging
   from 23 to 70\% depending on chloramine dose (1-150 mg of Cl-2/L) and
   was responsible for between 1 and 10\% of NDMA FP in most raw surface
   waters in which it was detected and up to 62\% of NDMA FP in wastewater.
   Samples with higher methadone concentrations had greater NDMA FP. We
   measured a median methadone concentration of 23 ng/L with a range of
   1-2256 ng/L among detections, which was consistent with high occurrence
   rates and environmental persistence for methadone in the published
   literature for surface waters and wastewaters. A literature review of
   methadone use, metabolism, and fate in the United States resulted in a
   prediction of low nanogram per liter levels of methadone-associated NDMA
   FP at drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) downstream of communities
   using methadone. Medicinal use of methadone potentially displaces and
   transforms the health risks associated with heroin use by individuals to
   possible cancer risk for populations served by downstream DWTPs. This
   work is among the first to contrast known public health benefits of
   pharmaceutical-taking patients against the potential exposure of
   millions of people to physiologically relevant levels of carcinogenic
   NDMA in chloraminated drinking water.}},

Abstract = {{We study delivering delay-sensitive data to a group of receivers with
   minimum latency. This latency consists of the time that the data spends
   in overlay links as well as the delay incurred at each overlay node,
   which has to send out a piece of data several times over a
   finite-capacity network connection. The latter part is a significant
   portion of the total delay as we show in the paper, yet it is often
   ignored or only partially addressed by previous multicast algorithms. We
   analyze the actual delay in multicast trees and consider building trees
   with minimum-average and minimum-maximum delay. We show the NP-hardness
   of these problems and prove that they cannot be approximated in
   polynomial time to within any reasonable approximation ratio. We then
   present a set of algorithms to build minimum-delay multicast trees that
   cover a wide range of application requirements-min-average and min-max
   delay, for different scales, real-time requirements, and session
   characteristics. We conduct comprehensive experiments on different
   real-world datasets, using various overlay network models. The results
   confirm that our algorithms can achieve much lower delays (up to 60\%
   less) and up to orders-of-magnitude faster running times (i.e.,
   supporting larger scales) than previous related approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Swallowing is a complex biomechanical process. In this review, several
   different techniques for measuring swallowing physiology are described,
   and limitations of each instrumental perspective are discussed. The
   techniques discussed include videofluoroscopy, endoscopy,
   three-dimensional dynamic computed tomography imaging, ultrasound,
   electromagnetic articulography, electromyography, lingual and pharyngeal
   manometry, electropalatography, airflow measurement, and swallowing
   acoustics/accelerometry. It is hoped that this review will inform
   scientists in the food oral-processing field regarding methods that may
   be useful for capturing relevant features of swallowing behavior across
   different food textures and liquid consistencies. Likewise, it is hoped
   that the delineation of current gaps in knowledge will reveal topics of
   shared interest for swallowing and food oral scientists as a first step
   toward future collaboration.
   Practical ApplicationsSwallowing is something that we take for granted,
   but is actually a complicated biomechanical activity involving many
   muscles. The process of swallowing can be studied or measured using a
   variety of different clinical and instrumental techniques. In this
   review article, the strengths and limitations of several different
   instrumental approaches to measuring swallowing behaviours are
   discussed. An extensive reference list is provided to original articles
   using these different techniques.}},

Abstract = {{A tunable diode laser (TDL) was used to measure hydrogen chloride (HCI)
   spectra at 5747 cm(-1) (1.74 mu m) and temperatures of 25-950 degrees C
   in a quartz cell. The purpose was to evaluate the capability of
   monitoring HCI concentration under pyrohydrolysis conditions using a
   near-infrared (NIR) laser. These conditions are characterized by 20-40\%
   HCI, 2-40\% H2O, and the presence of metal chloride vapors at
   temperatures of 600-1000 degrees C. Spectral peak area measurements of
   HCI-N-2 mixtures at atmospheric pressure and a path length of 8.1 cm
   showed linear absorption behavior between concentrations of 5-95\% and
   temperatures of 25-950 degrees C. Results from the addition of 2-40\%
   water (H2O) indicate that the HCI peak area relationships are not
   affected for temperatures of 350-950 degrees C. Evaporating NiCl2 within
   the cell did not show spectral interference effects with HCI between 650
   and 850 degrees C. The results from this work indicate that a
   near-infrared optical sensor is capable of measuring high HCI
   concentrations at high temperatures in the presence of high H2O content
   during pyrohydrolysis process conditions.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a simulation testbed framework to evaluate
   the performance of a self-learning adaptive traffic signal control
   system. The core contribution of this paper is the assessment of the
   system's two modes of operations (independent versus coordinated) under
   different congestion levels and network configurations. The insights and
   conclusions of the paper are based on the synergetic effect of the
   following: (1) appropriate design of the adaptive system parameters, (2)
   seamless design of generic interfaces between the adaptive system and
   the simulation environment using application programming interfaces, (3)
   rigorously calibrated simulation model and a comprehensive set of
   performance and environmental measures, and (4) investigation of the
   system components required for building a complete functioning system in
   the field. The system was designed and lab-tested on two case studies in
   the City of Burlington, Ontario. The intersections were designed and
   operated using the adaptive system and compared to the actuated
   optimized and coordinated base case timings plans. The analysis of the
   simulation results shows that overall the adaptive system outperforms
   the base case scenario by up to 25\% savings in delay at the network
   level, and 15\% reduction in CO2 emission. On the other hand, the
   results of the two testbed models indicate that the performance of the
   adaptive system varies according to the intersection conditions and
   flows, network configuration, traffic volume, variability in flow
   arrivals, and the proximity of intersections to each other.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Several neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with
   social processing deficits. The objective of this study was to compare
   patterns of social perception abilities across obsessive-compulsive
   disorder (OCD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD), and control participants.
   Method: A total of 265 children completed the Reading the Mind in the
   Eyes Test Child Version (RMET). Parents or caregivers completed
   established trait/symptom scales. The predicted percentage of accuracy
   on the RMET was compared across disorders and by item difficulty and
   item valence (i.e., positive/negative/neutral mental states), then
   analyzed for associations with trait/symptom scores.
   Results: The percentage of correct RMET scores varied significantly
   between diagnostic groups (p <.0001). On pairwise group comparisons
   controlling for age and sex, children with ADHD and ASD scored lower
   than the other groups (p <.0001). When IQ was also controlled for in the
   model, participants with OCD performed better than controls (p <.001),
   although differences between other groups were less pronounced.
   Participants with ASD scored lowest on easy items. Those with ASD and
   ADHD scored significantly lower than other groups on items with positive
   valence (p <.01). Greater social communication impairment and
   hyperactivity/impulsivity, but not OCD traits/symptoms, were associated
   with lower scores on the RMET, irrespective of diagnosis.
   Conclusion: Social perception abilities in neurodevelopmental disorders
   exist along a continuum. Children with ASD have the greatest deficits,
   whereas children with OCD may be hypersensitive to social information.
   Social communication deficits and hyperactive/impulsive traits are
   associated with impaired social perception abilities; these findings
   highlight overlapping cognitive and behavioral manifestations across
   disorders.}},

Abstract = {{We propose Time Space Threshold Vector Error Correction (TS-TVEC) model

   of cointegration with error correction mechanism is employed in the
   general design of the new statistical model TS-TVEC. An inherent
   connection between mathematical form of error correction model and
   traffic flow theory is revealed through the transformation of the
   well-known Fundamental Traffic Diagrams. A threshold regime switching
   framework is implemented to overcome any unknown structural changes in
   traffic time series. Spatial cross correlated information is
   incorporated with a piecewise linear vector error correction model. A
   Neural Network model is also constructed in parallel to comparatively
   test the effectiveness and robustness of the new statistical model. Our
   empirical study shows that the TS-TVEC model is an effective tool that
   is capable of modeling the complexity of stochastic traffic flow
   processes and potentially applicable to real time traffic state

Title = {{Trunk control impairment is responsible for postural instability during

Journal = {{CLINICAL BIOMECHANICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{30}},

Pages = {{507-512}},

Abstract = {{Background: Individuals with cervical spinal cord injury usually sustain
   impairments to the trunk and upper and lower limbs, resulting in
   compromised sitting balance. The objectives of this study were to: 1)
   compare postural control of individuals with cervical spinal cord injury
   and able-bodied individuals; and 2) investigate the effects of foot
   support and trunk fluctuations on postural control during sitting
   balance.
   Methods: Ten able-bodied individuals and six individuals with cervical
   spinal cord injury were asked to sit quietly during two 60 s trials. The
   forces exerted on the seat and the foot support surfaces were measured
   separately using two force plates. The global centre of pressure sway
   was obtained from the measurements on the two force plates, and the sway
   for each force plate was calculated individually.
   Findings: Individuals with spinal cord injury had at least twice as
   large global and seat sways compared to able-bodied individuals, while
   foot support sway was not significantly different between the two
   groups. Comparison between global and seat sways showed that
   anterior-posterior velocity of global sway was larger compared to the
   seat sway in both groups.
   Interpretation: Postural control of individuals with cervical spinal
   cord injury was worse than that of able-bodied individuals. The trunk
   swayed more in individuals with spinal cord injury, while the
   stabilization effect of the feet did not differ between the groups. Foot
   support affected anterior-posterior fluctuations in both groups equally.
   Thus, trunk control is the dominant mechanism contributing to sitting
   balance in both able-bodied and spinal cord injury individuals. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{The dynamic voltage restorer (DVR) is a series compensator for
   distribution system applications, which protects sensitive loads against
   voltage sags by fast voltage injection. The DVR must estimate the
   magnitude and phase of the measured voltages to achieve the desired
   performance. This paper proposes a phasor parameter estimation algorithm
   based on a recursive variable and fixed data window least error squares
   (LES) method for the DVR control system. The proposed algorithm, in
   addition to decreasing the computational burden, improves the frequency
   response of the control scheme based on the fixed data window LES
   method. The DVR control system based on the proposed algorithm provides
   a better compromise between the estimation speed and accuracy of the
   voltage and current signals and can be implemented using a simple and
   low-cost processor. The results of the studies indicate that the
   proposed algorithm is insensitive to noise, harmonics, interharmonics,
   and dc offset unlike the LES method, while both methods estimate the
   phasor parameters within 5 ms. The performance of the control scheme
   based on the proposed method is evaluated by multiple case studies in
   the PSCAD/EMTDC environment and experimentally validated based on a
   laboratory setup.}},

Abstract = {{Current human-machine interfaces (HMIs) for users with severe
   disabilities often have difficulty distinguishing between intentional
   and inadvertent activations. Pre-movement neuro-cortical activity may
   aid in this elusive discrimination task but has not been exploited in
   HMIs. This work investigates the utility of the readiness potential
   (RP), a slow negative cortical potential preceding voluntary movement,
   for detecting the intention of self-initiated fine movements prior to
   their motoric realization. We recorded electroencephalography from the
   frontal, central, parietal and occipital lobes of 10 participants using
   a self-initiated switch activation protocol. Eye movement artifacts were
   removed by regression and the RP was detected on a single-trial basis,
   in a narrow frequency range (0.1-1Hz). Common average reference was
   applied prior to windowed-averaging for feature extraction. Electrodes
   were selected according to a separability measure based on Fisher
   projection. Our findings demonstrate that feature fusion from an optimal
   number of electrodes achieves a statistically significant lower
   classification error than the best single classifier. Finally, voluntary
   fine movement intention was detected on a single-trial basis at
   above-chance levels approximately 396 ms before physical switch
   activation. These findings encourage the development of rapid-response,
   intention-aware HMIs for individuals with severe disabilities who
   struggle with executing voluntary fine motor movements.}},

Abstract = {{Solar cells based on inorganic absorbers, such as Si, GaAs, CdTe and
   Cu(In, Ga)Se-2, permit a high device efficiency and stability. The
   crystals' three-dimensional structure means that dangling bonds
   inevitably exist at the grain boundaries (GBs), which significantly
   degrades the device performance via recombination losses. Thus, the
   growth of single-crystalline materials or the passivation of defects at
   the GBs is required to address this problem, which introduces an added
   processing complexity and cost. Here we report that antimony selenide
   (Sb2Se3)-a simple, non-toxic and low-cost material with an optimal solar
   bandgap of similar to 1.1 eV-exhibits intrinsically benign GBs because
   of its one-dimensional crystal structure. Using a simple and fast
   (similar to 1 mu m min(-1)) rapid thermal evaporation process, we
   oriented crystal growth perpendicular to the substrate, and produced
   Sb2Se3 thin-film solar cells with a certified device efficiency of
   5.6\%. Our results suggest that the family of one-dimensional crystals,
   including Sb2Se3, SbSeI and Bi2S3, show promise in photovoltaic
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, we investigate the effect of carbon nanotube (CNT)
   waviness on the active constrained layer damping (ACLD) of the laminated
   hybrid composite shells. In particular, the effect of CNT waviness has
   been studied for the case of a novel nano-tailored composite-continuous
   fuzzy fiber-reinforced composite (FFRC). The distinctive feature of the
   construction of the FFRC is that the uniformly spaced straight or wavy
   CNTs are radially grown on the circumferential surfaces of carbon
   fibers. The constraining layer of the ACLD treatment is considered to be
   made of vertically or obliquely reinforced 1-3 piezoelectric composite
   material. A three-dimensional finite element model has been developed to
   study the damping characteristics of the laminated FFRC shells
   integrated with the patches of ACLD treatment. Our results reveal that
   (i) the planar orientation of CNT waviness has a significant influence
   on the damping characteristics of the laminated FFRC shells, (ii)
   damping characteristics of the symmetric cross-ply, and antisymmetric
   angle-ply laminated FFRC shells are improved if CNT waviness is coplanar
   with the longitudinal plane of the carbon fiber, and (iii) for the
   antisymmetric cross-ply laminated FFRC shells, the performance of the
   ACLD patches becomes maximum for attenuating the fundamental mode when
   CNT waviness is coplanar with the transverse plane of the carbon fiber.}},

Abstract = {{The joint user association and spectrum allocation problem is studied
   for multi-tier heterogeneous networks (HetNets) in both downlink and
   uplink in the interference-limited regime. Users are associated with
   base-stations (BSs) based on the biased downlink received power.
   Spectrum is either shared or orthogonally partitioned among the tiers.
   This paper models the placement of BSs in different tiers as spatial
   point processes and adopts stochastic geometry to derive the theoretical
   mean proportionally fair utility of the network based on the coverage
   rate. By formulating and solving the network utility maximization
   problem, the optimal user association bias factors and spectrum
   partition ratios are analytically obtained for the multi-tier network.
   The resulting analysis reveals that the downlink and uplink user
   associations do not have to be symmetric. For uplink under spectrum
   sharing, if all tiers have the same target signal-to-interference ratio
   (SIR), distance-based user association is shown to be optimal under a
   variety of path loss and power control settings. For both downlink and
   uplink, under orthogonal spectrum partition, it is shown that the
   optimal proportion of spectrum allocated to each tier should match the
   proportion of users associated with that tier. Simulations validate the
   analytical results. Under typical system parameters, simulation results
   suggest that spectrum partition performs better for downlink in terms of
   utility, while spectrum sharing performs better for uplink with power
   control.}},

Abstract = {{Thompson's model of very large scale integration computation relates the
   energy of a computation to the product of the circuit area and the
   number of clock cycles needed to carry out the computation. It is shown
   that for any sequence of increasing block-length decoder circuits
   implemented according to this model, if the probability of block error
   is asymptotically less than 1/2 then the energy of the computation
   scales at least as Omega(n(log n)(1/2)), and so the energy of decoding
   per bit must scale at least as Omega (log n)(1/2). This implies that the
   average energy per decoded bit must approach infinity for any sequence
   of decoders that approaches capacity. The analysis techniques used are
   then extended to show that for any sequence of increasing block-length
   serial decoders, if the asymptotic block error probability is less than
   1/2 then the energy scales at least as fast as Omega (n log n). In a
   very general case that allows for the number of output pins to vary with
   block length, it is shown that the energy must scale as Omega (n(log
   n)(1/5)). A simple example is provided of a class of circuits performing
   low-density parity-check decoding whose energy complexity scales as
   O(n(2) log log n).}},

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the symmetric degrees of freedom (DoF) of
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cellular networks with G cells and
   K users per cell, having N antennas at each base station and M antennas
   at each user. In particular, we investigate techniques for achievability
   that are based on either decomposition with asymptotic interference
   alignment or linear beamforming schemes and show that there are distinct
   regimes of (G, K, M, N), where one outperforms the other. We first note
   that both one-sided and two-sided decomposition with asymptotic
   interference alignment achieve the same DoF. We then establish specific
   antenna configurations under which the DoF achieved using
   decomposition-based schemes is optimal by deriving a set of outer bounds
   on the symmetric DoF. Using these results, we completely characterize
   the optimal DoF of any G-cell network with single-antenna users. For
   linear beamforming schemes, we first focus on small networks and propose
   a structured approach to linear beamforming based on a notion called
   packing ratios. Packing ratio describes the interference footprint or
   shadow cast by a set of transmit beamformers and enables us to identify
   the underlying structures for aligning interference. Such a structured
   beamforming design can be shown to achieve the optimal spatially
   normalized DoF (sDoF) of two-cell two-user/cell network and the two-cell
   three-user/cell network. For larger networks, we develop an unstructured
   approach to linear interference alignment, where transmit beamformers
   are designed to satisfy conditions for interference alignment without
   explicitly identifying the underlying structures for interference
   alignment. The main numerical insight of this paper is that such an
   approach appears to be capable of achieving the optimal sDoF for MIMO
   cellular networks in regimes where linear beamforming dominates
   asymptotic decomposition, and a significant portion of sDoF elsewhere.
   Remarkably, polynomial identity test appears to play a key role in
   identifying the boundary of the achievable sDoF region in the former
   case.}},

Abstract = {{The self-centering energy-dissipative (SCED) brace is a new steel
   bracing member that provides both damping and recentering capability to
   a structure, while reducing or eliminating residual building
   deformations after major seismic events. Previous SCED brace designs
   exhibited full self-centering capability over frame lateral deformations
   ranging from 1.5 to 2.0\% of a typical building story height owing to
   the elongation capacity of the tendons comprising the system. To
   overcome this limitation, a new enhanced-elongation telescoping SCED
   (T-SCED) brace has been developed that allows for self-centering
   response over two times the range achieved with the original SCED
   bracing system. A prototype design of this proposed system was
   fabricated and tested quasi-statically and dynamically in a full-scale
   vertical steel frame. It exhibited full self-centering behavior in a
   single story frame that was laterally deformed to 4\% of its story
   height. This new T-SCED brace also satisfied standard testing protocols
   for buckling restrained braces. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {{An in-depth understanding about the reactions in the high-temperature
   zone of a blast furnace is significant to optimize both the current and
   future blast furnace process. The interfaces between coke, slag, and
   metal were observed using scanning electronic microscope with samples
   obtained from the tuyere level of a blast furnace. Two types of slag
   phases were identified, one originating from coke ash and the other from
   the bosh slag. Slag formed by coke ash was seen to cover the coke
   surface, which may hinder the reaction of coke with both gas and liquid
   iron. The reduction of FeO from the bosh slag (originated from the
   primary slag) occurs in the coke/slag interface with the reduced iron
   forming a metal layer surrounding the coke surface. The reduction of
   SiO2 occurs both in and outside the coke, and the reduced silicon reacts
   with iron to form iron silicide if the two species come into contact.
   Further study is proposed based on the results of this study.}},

Abstract = {{This manuscript presents research work related to the assimilation of
   Silicon (Si) in molten Aluminum (Al) under natural and forced convection
   conditions. The effects of impurity levels of solid Si, Al bath
   temperature, and fluid flow conditions were investigated. It was found
   that a polycrystalline metallurgical grade Si (MGSi) with higher levels
   of impurities dissolved more slowly than high purity polycrystalline
   MGSi, which showed a similar dissolution rate to monocrystalline
   electronic grade Si. For high-purity Si cylinders, the experimental data
   under natural convection conditions exhibit good agreement with a
   correlation for vertical cylinders: Under forced convection conditions,
   by rotating the molten Al, the mass transfer rate increased at higher
   liquid velocities, implying that the dissolution process is controlled
   by liquid phase diffusion. When the forced convection prevails, the
   experimental data are well predicted by a correlation for vertical
   cylinders in cross flow: Finally, at lower velocities of liquid Al, the
   combined effect of natural and forced convection must be considered, and
   a correlation is proposed based on the buoyancy force normal to the
   direction of the flow.}},

Abstract = {{Following on a study of Si dissolution in molten Al, the effect of gas
   agitation is examined. The effects of gas flow rate, liquid bulk
   velocity, the position of a top injection lance, and bath temperature on
   the dissolution rate are quantified. A higher gas flow rate produced
   larger bubbles while bubble frequency remained relatively unchanged.
   This resulted in larger bubble-induced fluctuating velocities which in
   turn increased the dissolution rate. At lower bulk velocities, the
   effect of gas agitation is localized around the lance. By increasing the
   velocity, the effect of gas agitation is transported further into the
   bath. The dissolution rate enhancement varies with increasing bulk
   velocity, and explanations are provided. When combined with a bulk flow,
   gas agitation increases the dissolution rate regardless of lance
   position. Also, the enhancement of dissolution rate due to gas injection
   decreases at higher superheats, as the higher bath temperature increases
   the mass boundary thickness. In addition, the dissolution rate without
   gas agitation (single-phase flow) and with gas agitation (two-phase
   flow) is compared in terms of mean mass transfer coefficients. It was
   found that for the same liquid bulk velocities, the mean mass transfer
   coefficients are higher in two-phase flow than in single-phase flow.
   Finally, an increment to the single-phase flow bulk velocity that would
   be required to gain parity with the two-phase flow dissolution rate rise
   is demonstrated.}},

Abstract = {{This study applies land-use regression (LUR) to characterize the spatial
   distribution of ultrafine particles (UFP) in a large city. Particle
   number (PN) concentrations were measured in residential areas around
   Toronto, Canada, between June and August 2008. A combination of fixed
   and mobile monitoring was used to assess spatial gradients between and
   within communities. The fixed monitoring locations included a central
   site, two downtown sites, and four residential sites located 6-15 km
   from the downtown core. The mobile data included average PN
   concentrations collected on 112 road segments from 10 study routes that
   were repeated on three separate days. The mobile data was used to create
   the land-use regression model while the fixed sites were used for
   validation purposes. The predictor variables that best described the
   spatial variation of PN concentration (R-2 = 0.72, validated R-2 = 0.68)
   included population density within 300 m, total resource and industrial
   area within 1000 m, total residential area within 3000 m, and major
   roadway and highway length within 3000 m. The LUR model successfully
   predicted the afternoon peak PN concentration (slope = 0.96, R-2 = 0.86)
   but over-predicted the 24-h average PN concentration (slope = 1.28, R-2
   = 0.72) measured at seven fixed monitoring sites. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds offer diverse pricing options,
   including on-demand and reserved instances with various discounts to
   attract different cloud users. A practical problem facing cloud users is
   how to minimize their costs by choosing among different pricing options
   based on their own demands. In this paper, we propose a new cloud
   brokerage service that reserves a large pool of instances from cloud
   providers and serves users with price discounts. The broker optimally
   exploits both pricing benefits of long-term instance reservations and

Abstract = {{Lately, for geo-distributed data centers, a workload management approach
   that routes user requests to locations with cheaper and cleaner
   electricity has been developed to reduce energy consumption and cost. We
   consider two key aspects that have not been explored in this approach.
   First, through empirical studies, we find that the energy efficiency of
   cooling systems depends critically on the ambient temperature, which
   exhibits significant geographical diversity. Temperature diversity can
   be used to reduce the cooling energy overhead. Second, energy
   consumption comes from not only interactive workloads driven by user
   requests, but also delay tolerant batch workloads that run at the
   back-end. The elastic nature of batch workloads can be exploited to
   further reduce the energy cost. In this paper, we propose to make
   workload management temperature aware. We formulate the problem as a
   joint optimization of request routing for interactive workloads and
   capacity allocation for batch workloads. We develop a distributed
   algorithm based on an m-block alternating direction method of
   multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that extends the classical two-block
   algorithm. We prove the convergence and rate of convergence results
   under general assumptions. Through trace-driven simulations, we find
   that our approach consistently provides 15-20 percent cooling energy
   reduction, and 5-20 percent overall cost reduction over existing
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{We report on a semiconductor nanostructures/metal Schottky junction for

   an electron mobility of 64.9 cm V-1 s(-1) and electron concentration of

   co-evaporation method. Electrical analysis reveals that the Schottky
   barrier diodes (SBD) based on the ZnS:Cl NRs/Au junctions exhibited
   typical rectifying behavior (rectification ratio > 10(3)) with Schottky
   barrier height of .64 eV and a small ideality factor of similar to 1.05
   at 320 K. Interestingly, n-ZnS:Cl NR/Au nano-SBD device exhibited
   pronounced negative photoresponse at forward bias, but positive
   photoresponse at reverse bias under 365 nm UV light irradiation.
   Finally, the detailed reason for this phenomenon was explained by the

Abstract = {{A two-dimensional lumped-parameter simulation of the head and neck has
   been carried out to capture the dynamic whiplash response during
   rear-end collisions in the sagittal plane. Joint locations are
   positioned at the instantaneous axis of rotation locations to capture
   the realistic intervertebral motions of the cervical spine for the 50th
   percentile male. Rotational viscoelastic joints are defined at each
   joint using linear stiffness and damping parameters in a Voigt
   configuration. Lagrangian mechanics is used to derive the whiplash
   response for a given collision acceleration. An inverse analysis is used
   to determine the viscoelastic lumped-parameter values based on cadaver
   whiplash test results. The results of four models are presented,
   demonstrating the response and influence of stiffness and damping joint
   parameters for the following models: (1) uniform joint stiffness with no
   damping, (2) joint stiffness with no damping, (3) joint damping with no
   stiffness, and (4) joint stiffness and joint damping. The rigid-linkage
   viscoelastic joint stiffness and joint damping lumped-parameter model is
   seen to provide quick solution results and good overall results for the
   head and intervertebral response (peak head x-displacement,
   y-displacement and rotation within 10, 20 mm and 7.5A degrees) compared
   with cadaver test results. This model can be easily scaled to
   accommodate anthropometric differences in occupant height, weight,
   gender, and posture for the desired collision dynamics. These properties
   make this rigid-linkage model well-suited for injury assessment and use
   in head-restraint optimization to minimize injury and improve neck
   biofidelity in anthropometric test dummies.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, as a state of the art testing method, real-time hybrid
   simulation (RTHS) is implemented and verified with a shake table for
   education and research. As an application example, the dynamic behavior
   of a tuned liquid damper (TLD)-structure system is investigated. RTHS is
   a practical and economical experimental technique which complements the
   strengths of computer simulation with physical testing. It separates the
   test structure into two substructures where part of the structure for
   which a reliable analytical model is not available is tested physically
   (experimental substructure) and coupled together with the analytical
   model of the remaining structure (analytical substructure). The
   implementation of RTHS involves challenges in accurate control of the
   experimental substructure as well as the synchronization of the signals.
   The details of the hardware and the software developed and the steps
   taken to improve the controller are discussed in this paper so that the
   implementation of RTHS is properly introduced. The accuracy has been
   verified using tracking indicators as well as using the response
   obtained from a spring-mass oscillator and TLD system. The shake table
   used in this study is available in over 100 universities around the
   world. In this paper, the implementation of RTHS is provided with
   sufficient details to enable easy introduction of this testing method
   wherever a similar shake table is available. This additional
   functionality will not only provide a new research tool, but it will
   also facilitate classroom demonstrations to improve how students
   understand new concepts in structural dynamics and earthquake
   engineering.}},

Abstract = {{Recent research interest in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) has grown
   towards effective manufacturing processes that are compatible with
   low-cost materials such as stainless steel structural supports.
   Suspension plasma spraying is a promising technique that rapidly
   produces a fully consolidated, thin electrolyte layer with good
   microstructure control and without any post-deposition heat treatment.
   In the present study, suspension plasma spraying was used to deposit
   yttria-stabilized zirconia electrolyte coatings on porous stainless
   steel substrates using a range of spray conditions. Mechanical
   properties of the coatings, such as hardness and fracture toughness,
   were characterized. These properties can affect the durability of SOFC
   electrolytes, coupled with the thermal stresses generated during
   operation. Coating toughness and hardness were observed to be dependent
   on the torch power and stand-off distance during fabrication, which
   affect coating microstructural features such as porosity, microcracks,
   and segmentation cracks. The fracture toughness measured using an
   indentation technique of the coatings produced with a torch power of 133
   kW and a stand-off distance of 90 mm was found to be 1.5 +/- 0.15 MPa
   m(1/2). (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Disturbances in roadway networks due to increases in demand or drops in
   network capacity can severely degrade the performance of the system. The
   robustness of a roadway network to such disturbances has been
   investigated using a variety of methods leading to disparate robust
   network designs. This paper introduces a unifying framework for
   understanding and applying different robust network designs based on the
   context of traffic disturbances and design goals. It presents the
   objectives, requirements and examples of robust network design with
   long-term (planning) and short-term (operation) goals. A sample case
   study is presented to assess a short-term robust network design using
   traffic assignment. The preliminary testing results compared to
   conventional User Equilibrium and System Optimal traffic assignment,
   demonstrate 20\% and 10\% travel time savings with demand increase and

Abstract = {{The ability to control material properties in space and time for
   functionally graded viscoelastic materials makes them an asset where
   they can be adapted to different design requirements. The continuous
   microstructure makes them advantageous over conventional composite
   materials. Functionally graded porous structures have the added
   advantage over conventional functionally graded materials of offering a
   significant weight reduction compared to a minor drop in strength.
   Functionally graded porous structures of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene
   (ABS) had been fabricated with a solid-state constrained foaming
   process. Correlating the microstructure to material properties requires
   a deterministic analysis of the cellular structure. This is accomplished
   by analyzing the scanning electron microscopy images with a locally
   adaptive image threshold technique based on variational energy
   minimization. This characterization technique of the cellular morphology
   is analyst independent and works very well for porous structures.
   Inferences are drawn from the effect of processing on microstructure and
   then correlated to creep strain and creep compliance. Creep is strongly
   correlated to porosity and pore sizes but more associated to the size
   than to porosity. The results show the potential of controlling the
   cellular morphology and hence tailoring creep strain/compliance of ABS
   to some desired values. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci.,

Journal = {{CARBON}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{10-17}},
Month = {{JUN}},
Abstract = {{The wettability of graphitic carbon can impact the behavior of many
   carbonaceous materials in a variety of systems involving water, for
   example, the carbon aerosols-cloud interaction that affects the climate
   and the penetration of micropores by aqueous solution in activated
   carbons. Previous studies on this topic have been limited to the basal
   surface of graphite. Apparent water-contact angle (WCA) values reported
   in the literature for the basal surface of graphite or graphene sheet
   vary from 35 degrees to 126 degrees, due to factors such as surface
   contamination and roughness. The intrinsic wettability of graphitic
   carbon remains uncertain. Here we report the first experimental attempt
   of quantifying the intrinsic wettability of the edge surface of
   graphite. We show that the basal surface is intrinsically hydrophilic
   with a WCA of about 61 degrees; the edge surface is more hydrophilic
   than the basal surface and has an intrinsic WCA likely less than 40
   degrees. We also show that the apparent WCA is highly sensitive to
   sample preparation procedures. Annealing, a commonly used method for
   removing surface organic contaminants, could result in an underestimated
   WCA due to oxidation by the trace O-2 in the inert gases. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from a numerical investigation into the
   seismic retrofit of a soft story frame using a novel gapped-inclined
   brace (GIB) system. The GIB system consists of a pinned brace and a gap
   element that is added to the first story columns of the frame. The
   inclusion of GIB elements in addition to increasing the lateral capacity
   of columns at the first story increases the post-yield stiffness ratio
   of the system and reduces the P-delta effects on the columns, while not
   increasing the first story lateral resistance or stiffness. This allows
   for the isolating benefits of the soft story to protect the upper floors
   of the structure from damage while avoiding excessive deformations and
   reducing the propensity for collapse. A six-story RC frame with masonry
   infills on all floors except for the first floor is studied. The dynamic
   response of the retrofitted building using the GIB system is
   investigated numerically and is compared with the response of the
   original un-retrofitted building and the same building in which masonry
   infills are added to the first story to mitigate the soft story
   response. Results from the nonlinear time-history analyses indicate that
   the GIB system could provide a reliable seismic retrofit mechanism for
   soft story buildings, which greatly reduces the likelihood of collapse
   by increasing the displacement capacity of the soft storey and by
   reducing P-delta effects, while minimizing the overall damage and losses
   in the building by taking advantages of the isolation that is provided
   by the soft story to the rest of the structure located above. Copyright

Abstract = {{Recently we developed supervisor localization, a top-down approach to
   distributed control of discrete-event systems in the Ramadge-Wonham
   supervisory control framework. Its essence is the allocation of
   monolithic (global) control action among the local control strategies of
   individual agents. In this paper, we start by presenting several
   refinements of our localization theory. First, we drop the original
   assumption that the event sets of component agents are pairwise
   disjoint. Second, we show that consistent marking information can be
   enforced by just one agent, which can be selected arbitrarily. Third,
   the event sets of localized controllers are explicitly defined, in
   general as proper subsets of the entire event set. For these
   generalizations, we again prove that the collective local controlled
   behavior is identical to the global optimal and nonblocking controlled
   behavior. Moreover, we provide a language interpretation of localization
   by relating the key concept of control cover/congruence on the
   supervisor's state set to a special right congruence on the supervisor's
   language.W e go on to apply the extended supervisor localization to
   solve a multi-agent formation problem. We introduce a suitable
   formulation of formation invariance as well as shortest paths to
   formation. Local strategies are synthesized for a group of agents to
   arrive at a pre-specified formation in shortest paths; then issues of
   information exchange and control logic are examined. We further
   demonstrate the extended localization on a large-scale Cluster Tool
   example. By first synthesizing a set of decentralized supervisors and
   coordinators by an efficient heterarchical approach, our localization
   yields a distributed control architecture with comprehensible local
   control/coordination logic.}},

Abstract = {{In typical organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), the device turn-on

   reports that various combinations of active materials can be
   strategically selected to construct OLEDs with device working voltages
   below the HOMO-LUMO energy gaps of emitters; i.e., emitted photon
   energies are higher than applied electrical energies. The operation
   mechanism of this type of OLED is found to be related to ballistic
   Auger-electron injection at organic heterojunctions. This Auger-electron
   injection acts as a built-in voltage booster. The Auger-electron process
   predicts that the turn-on voltage scales linearly with the energy
   difference between an acceptor's LUMO and a donor's HOMO. This
   prediction is in excellent agreement with experimental data.}},

Abstract = {{Temperature plays an important role in many rock engineering practices.
   The increase or decrease of temperature induces the damage characterized

   is essential to quantify the damage induced by the heat-treatment and
   establish its correlation to the mechanical properties of rocks. In this
   study, X-ray Micro-computed tomography (CT), a non-destructive
   observation technique was utilized to quantify the damage induced by the
   heat-treatment. Using CT images, the damage variables were measured for
   Longyou sandstone (IS) at three heat-treatment temperatures, 250 degrees
   C, 450 degrees C, and 600 degrees C, and room temperature of 25 degrees
   C. The dynamic compressive strength of LS was then obtained by a
   modified split Hopkinson pressure bar system with the loading rate from
   10(2) to 10(4) GPa/s. An empirical equation to quantify the correlation
   between the damage variable and the dynamic compressive strength was

Abstract = {{The migration of gases from deep to shallow reservoirs can cause
   damageable events. For instance, some gases can pollute the biosphere or
   trigger explosions and eruptions. Seismic tomography may be employed to
   map the accumulation of subsurface bubble-bearing fluids to help
   mitigating such hazards. Nevertheless, how gas bubbles modify seismic
   waves is still unclear. We show that saturated rocks strongly attenuate
   seismic waves when gas bubbles occupy part of the pore space. Laboratory
   measurements of elastic wave attenuation at frequencies <100Hz are
   modeled with a dynamic gas dissolution theory demonstrating that the
   observed frequency-dependent attenuation is caused by
   wave-induced-gas-exsolution-dissolution (WIGED). This result is
   incorporated into a numerical model simulating the propagation of
   seismic waves in a subsurface domain containing CO2-gas bubbles. This
   simulation shows that WIGED can significantly modify the wavefield and
   illustrates how accounting for this physical mechanism can potentially
   improve the monitoring and surveying of gas bubble-bearing fluids in the
   subsurface.}},

Title = {{Metabolic engineering of a tyrosine-overproducing yeast platform using
   targeted metabolomics}},
Journal = {{MICROBIAL CELL FACTORIES}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{MAY 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: L-tyrosine is a common precursor for a wide range of
   valuable secondary metabolites, including benzylisoquinoline alkaloids
   (BIAs) and many polyketides. An industrially tractable yeast strain
   optimized for production of L-tyrosine could serve as a platform for the
   development of BIA and polyketide cell factories. This study applied a
   targeted metabolomics approach to evaluate metabolic engineering
   strategies to increase the availability of intracellular L-tyrosine in
   the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae CEN.PK. Our engineering strategies
   combined localized pathway engineering with global engineering of
   central metabolism, facilitated by genome-scale steady-state modelling.
   Results: Addition of a tyrosine feedback resistant version of
   3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate synthase Aro4 from S.
   cerevisiae was combined with overexpression of either a tyrosine
   feedback resistant yeast chorismate mutase Aro7, the native
   pentafunctional arom protein Aro1, native prephenate dehydrogenase Tyr1
   or cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase TyrC from Zymomonas mobilis. Loss of
   aromatic carbon was limited by eliminating phenylpyruvate decarboxylase
   Aro10. The TAL gene from Rhodobacter sphaeroides was used to produce
   coumarate as a simple test case of a heterologous by-product of
   tyrosine. Additionally, multiple strategies for engineering global
   metabolism to promote tyrosine production were evaluated using metabolic
   modelling. The T21E mutant of pyruvate kinase Cdc19 was hypothesized to
   slow the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and accumulate
   the former as precursor to the shikimate pathway. The ZWF1 gene coding
   for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase was deleted to create an NADPH
   deficiency designed to force the cell to couple its growth to tyrosine
   production via overexpressed NADP(+)-dependent prephenate dehydrogenase
   Tyr1. Our engineered Zwf1(-) strain expressing TYRC ARO4(FBR) and grown
   in the presence of methionine achieved an intracellular L-tyrosine
   accumulation up to 520 mu mol/g DCW or 192 mM in the cytosol, but
   sustained flux through this pathway was found to depend on the complete
   elimination of feedback inhibition and degradation pathways.
   Conclusions: Our targeted metabolomics approach confirmed a likely
   regulatory site at DAHP synthase and identified another possible
   cofactor limitation at prephenate dehydrogenase. Additionally, the
   genome-scale metabolic model identified design strategies that have the
   potential to improve availability of erythrose 4-phosphate for DAHP
   synthase and cofactor availability for prephenate dehydrogenase. We
   evaluated these strategies and provide recommendations for further
   improvement of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae.}},

Title = {{Influence of pre-existing discontinuities and bedding planes on
   hydraulic fracturing initiation}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{19}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{580-597}},

Abstract = {{Pressure-driven fracturing, also known as hydraulic fracturing, is a
   process widely used for developing geothermal resources, extracting
   hydrocarbons from unconventional reservoirs such as tight sandstone and
   shale formations, as well as for preconditioning the rock-mass during
   deep mining operations. While the overall process of pressure-driven
   fracturing is well understood, a quantitative description of the process
   is difficult due to both geologic and mechanistic uncertainties. Among
   them, the simulation of fractures growing in a complex heterogeneous
   medium is associated with computational difficulties. Experimental
   evidence based on micro-seismic monitoring clearly demonstrates the
   important influence of rock mass fabric on hydraulic fracture
   development, and the interaction between fluid-driven fractures and
   pre-existing discontinuities. However, these components are not well
   accounted for by standard numerical approaches. Thus, the design of
   hydraulic fracturing operations continues to be based on simplified
   models whereby the rock mass is treated as a homogeneous continuum. The
   purpose of this paper is to present the preliminary results obtained
   using the combined finite-discrete element technology to study the
   interaction between fluid driven fractures and natural rock mass
   discontinuities.}},

   In this work, electrospun PLGA nanofiber assemblies are utilized to
   create a scaffold. Aided by a polypropylene auxiliary supporter, the
   scaffold is able to maintain long-term integrity without dimensional
   shrinkage. This scaffold is also able to suspend in cell culture medium;
   hence, keratinocyte cells seeded on the scaffold are exposed to air as

Abstract = {{With the purpose of fabricating polymer nanocomposite foams and
   preventing coalescence in foaming processes, the interfacial tension of
   poly(lactic acid) (PLA)-silica composites is investigated in this work.
   Synthesized silica nanoparticles (SNs) with a CO2-philic surface
   modification are used as the dispersed nanoparticles. Interfacial
   tension is a key parameter in processing of polymer foams since it
   directly affects the final foam properties, such as cell size and cell
   density. Interfacial tension of silica-containing PLA and supercritical
   carbon dioxide (CO,) is measured using axisymmetric drop shape analysis
   profile (ADSA-P) pendant drop method at high pressures and high
   temperatures. The interfacial tension between PLA and supercritical CO2
   is observed to decrease as a result of the nanoparticles' adsorption to
   the interface. These results indicate that the reduction in interfacial
   tension with increasing silica content significantly deviates from a
   linear trend; there is a minimum at 2 wt \% loading of the SNs and then
   the interfacial tension curve reaches a plateau. Contact angle
   measurements show an affinity of the SNs for the polymer-supercritical
   CO2 interface, and these obtained results are used to calculate the
   binding energy of the nanopartides to the PLA/CO2 interface. In addition
   to interfacial properties, the adsorption of silica nanopartides at the
   interface is also studied in detail with scanning electron microscopy.}},

Abstract = {{The planning and implementation of a multimodal transportation system in
   the Holy City of Makkah to handle the huge volumes of pilgrims to the
   City is not a straightforward mission, as Makkah poses numerous
   challenges including its unique seasonal demand patterns, mountainous
   terrain, and limited space. Aerial ropeway transit (ART), a promising
   transport technology solution, could be an important component of this
   system. This paper presents the results of a technical and economic
   feasibility study to explore the potential of introducing ART service in
   Makkah. The study reveals that, overall, ART service on some corridors
   in Makkah is technically feasible, and with some necessary enforcement
   measures to attract ridership could become a profitable transportation
   investment. Specifically, the study recommends using ART for special
   user groups and service/emergency crews during peak seasons and opening
   ART to the public as a premium service during the off-peak season.}},

Title = {{Are Global and Regional Improvements in Life Expectancy and in Child,
   Adult and Senior Survival Slowing?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 18}},
Abstract = {{Improvements in life expectancy have been considerable over the past
   hundred years. Forecasters have taken to applying historical trends
   under an assumption of continuing improvements in life expectancy in the
   future. A linear mixed effects model was used to estimate the trends in
   global and regional rates of improvements in life expectancy, child,
   adult, and senior survival, in 166 countries between 1950 and 2010.
   Global improvements in life expectancy, including both child and adult
   survival rates, decelerated significantly over the study period. Overall
   life expectancy gains were estimated to have declined from 5.9 to 4.0
   months per year for a mean deceleration of -0.07 months/year(2); annual
   child survival gains declined from 4.4 to 1.6 deaths averted per 1000
   for a mean deceleration of -0.06 deaths/1000/year(2); adult survival
   gains were estimated to decline from 4.8 to 3.7 deaths averted per 1000
   per year for a mean deceleration of -0.08 deaths/1000/year(2). Senior
   survival gains however increased from 2.4 to 4.2 deaths averted per 1000
   per year for an acceleration of 0.03 deaths/1000/year(2). Regional
   variation in the four measures was substantial. The rates of global
   improvements in life expectancy, child survival, and adult survival have
   declined since 1950 despite an increase in the rate of improvements
   among seniors. We postulate that low-cost innovation, related to the
   last half-century progress in health-primarily devoted to children and
   middle age, is reaping diminishing returns on its investments. Trends
   are uneven across regions and measures, which may be due in part to the
   state of epidemiological transition between countries and regions and
   disparities in the diffusion of innovation, accessible only in
   high-income countries where life expectancy is already highest.}},

Abstract = {{Graphene has been intensively investigated as a possible hydrogen
   storage medium due to the spectacular properties granted by its
   two-dimensional nature. Since graphene's discovery, several new
   two-dimensional carbon allotropes have been theorized and synthesized.
   We investigated the hydrogen storage ability of six such allotropes:
   C-65, C-64, C-63 > C-62, C-31 and C-41. The ability to anchor lithium
   metal atoms over each allotrope and the hydrogen binding energies for
   each lithium decorated allotrope were studied with density functional
   theory using LDA, GGA and vdW-DF2 (for describing van der Waals
   interactions) functionals. All the allotropes were able to achieve
   double sided lithium decoration and hydrogen adsorption. Every allotrope
   other than C-31 possesed lithium binding energies stronger than bulk
   lithium's cohesive energy which indicates that adsorbed lithium atoms
   will not cluster on the allotrope surface. Furthermore, every structure
   produced hydrogen binding energies stronger than that of lithium
   decorated graphene, suggesting the potential of use of these structures
   in practical hydrogen storage media. The C-41 structure was able to
   adsorb far more hydrogen molecules than any other structure with a
   maximum hydrogen gravimetric density of 7.12 wt.\% using the vdW-DF2
   functional. Copyright (C) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{High velocity solution precursor flame spray process was used to deposit
   MnCo1.9Fe0.1O4 and Mn1.5Co1.5O4 coatings on Crofer 22 APU ferritic
   stainless steel samples. The solution precursors were manufactured by
   diluting metal nitrates into deionized water. The as-sprayed coatings
   were oxidized at 850 degrees C for 500 h to evaluate Cr-barrier and
   electrical properties.
   The post-mortem studies were performed with various qualitative and
   quantitative elemental analysis methods and a four-point measurement was
   used for the area specific resistance studies. The as-sprayed coatings
   were formed of single crystallite nanoparticles (10-20 nm) and
   polycrystalline sub-micron particles (100-500 nm). The small particle
   and crystallite size showed strong sintering behavior during the
   oxidation cycle. Cr-migration was fully prevented thought the oxidized
   coatings. The surface topography and grain growth dominated the
   electrical properties during the test cycle. Copyright (C) 2015,

Abstract = {{In this paper we present results from a series of laboratory hydraulic
   fracture experiments designed to investigate various components of the
   energy budget. The experiments involved a cylindrical sample of Westerly
   granite being deformed under various triaxial stress states and
   fractured with distilled water, which was injected at a range of
   constant rates. Acoustic emission sensors were absolutely calibrated,
   and the radiated seismic energy was estimated. The seismic energy was
   found to range from 7.02E-8\% to 1.24E-4\% of the injection energy which
   is consistent with a range of values for induced seismicity from
   field-scale hydraulic fracture operations. The deformation energy (crack
   opening) of the sample during hydraulic fracture propagation was
   measured using displacement sensors and ranged from 18\% to 94\% of the
   injection energy. Our results support the conclusion that aseismic
   deformation is a significant term in the hydraulic fracture energy
   budget.}},

   of mixed tumour profiles}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Month = {{MAY 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Tumour samples containing distinct sub-populations of cancer
   and normal cells present challenges in the development of reproducible
   biomarkers, as these biomarkers are based on bulk signals from mixed
   tumour profiles. ISOpure is the only mRNA computational purification
   method to date that does not require a paired tumour-normal sample,
   provides a personalized cancer profile for each patient, and has been
   tested on clinical data. Replacing mixed tumour profiles with
   ISOpure-preprocessed cancer profiles led to better prognostic gene
   signatures for lung and prostate cancer.
   Results: To simplify the integration of ISOpure into standard R-based
   bioinformatics analysis pipelines, the algorithm has been implemented as
   an R package. The ISOpureR package performs analogously to the original
   code in estimating the fraction of cancer cells and the patient cancer
   mRNA abundance profile from tumour samples in four cancer datasets.
   Conclusions: The ISOpureR package estimates the fraction of cancer cells
   and personalized patient cancer mRNA abundance profile from a mixed
   tumour profile. This open-source R implementation enables integration
   into existing computational pipelines, as well as easy testing,
   modification and extension of the model.}},

Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Month = {{MAY 13}},
Abstract = {{Coherent state photon sources are widely used in quantum information
   processing. In many applications, such as quantum key distribution
   (QKD), a coherent state functions as a mixture of Fock states by
   assuming that its phase is continuously randomized. In practice, such a
   crucial assumption is often not satisfied, and therefore the security of
   existing QKD experiments is not guaranteed. To bridge this gap, we
   provide a rigorous security proof of QKD with discrete-phase-randomized
   coherent state sources. Our results show that the performance of the
   discrete-phase randomization case is close to its continuous counterpart
   with only a small number (say, 10) of discrete phases. Compared to the
   conventional continuous phase randomization case, where an infinite
   amount of random bits are required, our result shows that only a small
   amount (say, 4 bits) of randomness is needed.}},

Title = {{Brain tumor is a sequence-specific RNA-binding protein that directs

   transition}},

Abstract = {{Background: Brain tumor (BRAT) is a Drosophila member of the TRIM-NHL
   protein family. This family is conserved among metazoans and its members
   function as post-transcriptional regulators. BRAT was thought to be
   recruited to mRNAs indirectly through interaction with the RNA-binding
   protein Pumilio (PUM). However, it has recently been demonstrated that
   BRAT directly binds to RNA. The precise sequence recognized by BRAT, the
   extent of BRAT-mediated regulation, and the exact roles of PUM and BRAT
   in post-transcriptional regulation are unknown.
   Results: Genome-wide identification of transcripts associated with BRAT
   or with PUM in Drosophila embryos shows that they bind largely
   non-overlapping sets of mRNAs. BRAT binds mRNAs that encode proteins
   associated with a variety of functions, many of which are distinct from
   those implemented by PUM-associated transcripts. Computational analysis
   of in vitro and in vivo data identified a novel RNA motif recognized by
   BRAT that confers BRAT-mediated regulation in tissue culture cells. The
   regulatory status of BRAT-associated mRNAs suggests a prominent role for
   BRAT in post-transcriptional regulation, including a previously
   unidentified role in transcript degradation. Transcriptomic analysis of
   embryos lacking functional BRAT reveals an important role in mediating
   the decay of hundreds of maternal mRNAs during the maternal-to-zygotic
   transition.
   Conclusions: Our results represent the first genome-wide analysis of the
   mRNAs associated with a TRIM-NHL protein and the first identification of
   an RNA motif bound by this protein family. BRAT is a prominent
   post-transcriptional regulator in the early embryo through mechanisms
   that are largely independent of PUM.}},

Abstract = {{We present a method of direct patterning of plasmonic nanofeatures on
   glass that is fast, scalable, tunable, and accessible to a wide range of
   users-a unique combination in the context of current nanofabrication
   options for plasmonic devices. These benefits are made possible by the
   localized heating and subsequent annealing of thin metal films using
   infrared light from a commercial CO2 laser system. This approach results
   in patterning times of 30 mm(2)/min with an average cost of
   \$0.10/mm(2). Colloidal Au nanoparticles with diameters between 15 and
   40 nm can be formed on glass surfaces with x-y patterning resolutions of
   similar to 180 mu m. While the higher resolution provided by lithography
   is essential in many applications, in cases where the spatial patterning
   resolution threshold is lower, commercial CO2 laser processing can be
   30-fold faster and 400-fold less expensive.}},

Abstract = {{Understanding the drivers of energy and material flows of cities is
   important for addressing global environmental challenges. Accessing,
   sharing, and managing energy and material resources is particularly
   critical for megacities, which face enormous social stresses because of
   their sheer size and complexity. Here we quantify the energy and
   material flows through the world's 27 megacities with populations
   greater than 10 million people as of 2010. Collectively the resource
   flows through megacities are largely consistent with scaling laws
   established in the emerging science of cities. Correlations are
   established for electricity consumption, heating and industrial fuel
   use, ground transportation energy use, water consumption, waste
   generation, and steel production in terms of heating-degree-days, urban
   form, economic activity, and population growth. The results help
   identify megacities exhibiting high and low levels of consumption and
   those making efficient use of resources. The correlation between per
   capita electricity use and urbanized area per capita is shown to be a
   consequence of gross building floor area per capita, which is found to
   increase for lower-density cities. Many of the megacities are growing
   rapidly in population but are growing even faster in terms of gross
   domestic product (GDP) and energy use. In the decade from 2001-2011,
   electricity use and ground transportation fuel use in megacities grew at
   approximately half the rate of GDP growth.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, the snap-through buckling of an initially curved
   microbeam subject to an electrostatic force, accounting for fringing
   field effect, is investigated. The general governing equations of the
   curved microbeam are developed using Euler-Bernoulli beam theory and
   used to develop a new criterion for the snap-through buckling of that
   beam. The size effect of the microbeam is accounted for using the
   modified couple stress theory, and intermolecular effects, such as van
   der Waals and Casimir forces, are also included in our snap-through
   formulations. The snap-through governing equations are solved using
   Galerkin decomposition of the deflection. The results of our work enable
   us to carefully characterize the snap-through behaviour of the initially
   curved microbeam. They further reveal the significant effect of the beam
   size, and to a much lesser extent, the effect of fringing field and
   intermolecular forces, upon the snap-through criterion for the curved
   beam.}},

   previously developed adaptive and robust radiation therapy (ARRT) method
   for lung cancer was demonstrated to be effective when the sequence of
   breathing patterns was well-behaved. In this paper, we examine the
   applicability of the ARRT method to less well-behaved breathing
   patterns. We develop a novel method to generate sequences of probability
   mass functions that represent different types of drift in the underlying
   breathing pattern. Computational results derived from applying the ARRT
   method to these sequences demonstrate that the ARRT method is effective
   for a much broader class of breathing patterns than previously

Abstract = {{The process optimization for production of a tough hybrid biocomposite
   through long fibre thermoplastic direct compounding and moulding process
   (LFT-D) was investigated with an ultimate goal of high impact strength.
   High shear mixing - twin screw extrusion - and low shear mixing - single
   screw extrusion methods were used for the production of tough hybrid
   composites. The optimum operating condition was found to be the twin
   screw extrusion at which feeder to motor speed ratio was 1:10 without
   breaker and die while feeding the GF before the vent at 100 rpm. The
   hybrid composite produced accordingly had well dispersed fibres with GF
   content of 20 wt\%, the average length of 23 mm, and impact strength of
   130 J/m. It can be concluded that toughness was influenced by fibre

Abstract = {{Core needle biopsy (CNB) sampling is known to be inexpensive and
   minimally invasive relative to traditional tissue resectioning. But CNBs
   are often not used in analytical settings because of the tiny amount of
   sample and analyte. To address this challenge, we introduce an
   analytical method capable of multiplexed steroid quantification in CNB
   samples-those studied here ranged in mass from 2 to 8 mg. The new method
   uses digital microfluidics to extract steroids from CNB tissue samples
   (including a solid-phase extraction cleanup step) followed by analysis
   by high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
   (HPLC-MS/MS). The method has limits of detection of 3.6,1.6, 5.8, and
   8.5 fmol for estradiol, androstendione, testoterone, and progesterone,
   respectively. We propose that future generations of this method may be
   useful for regular quantification of steroids in core needle biopsy
   samples of breast tissue to inform dosage and timing of antihormone or
   hormone replacement therapies as part of a personalized medicine
   approach to treating a variety of hormone-sensitive disorders.}},

Title = {{The Perils of Adapting to Dose Errors in Radiation Therapy}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY 5}},
Abstract = {{We consider adaptive robust methods for lung cancer that are also
   dose-reactive, wherein the treatment is modified after each treatment
   session to account for the dose delivered in prior treatment sessions.
   Such methods are of interest because they potentially allow for errors
   in the delivered dose to be corrected as the treatment progresses,
   thereby ensuring that the tumor receives a sufficient dose at the end of
   the treatment. We show through a computational study with real lung
   cancer patient data that while dose reaction is beneficial with respect
   to the final dose distribution, it may lead to exaggerated daily
   underdose and overdose relative to non-reactive methods that grows as
   the treatment progresses. However, by combining dose reaction with a
   mechanism for updating an estimate of the uncertainty, the magnitude of
   this growth can be mitigated substantially. The key finding of this
   paper is that reacting to dose errors - an adaptation strategy that is
   both simple and intuitively appealing - may backfire and lead to
   treatments that are clinically unacceptable.}},

Volume = {{54}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{855-876}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents a new method for estimating regional trade flows
   using transportation survey data describing commodity origin-destination
   flows. Explicit attention is paid to the difference between commodity
   flows and trade flows that arises from the presence of transhipment
   points. Observed commodity flows in the transportation survey data are
   converted to production-consumption trade flows that are consistent with
   the multi-regional input-output framework. Regional trade flow estimates
   are then reconciled with regional production and consumption estimates
   using a mathematical program that aims to make minimal adjustments while
   imposing known multi-regional input-output accounting identities. It is
   shown that commodities originating or terminating at a transhipment
   point should be reassigned to their probable production origins or
   consumption destinations as long as an unbiased sample of previous
   observations is available. As the number of observations increases, the
   prediction error of the production origin or consumption destination
   decreases exponentially. A real-world case study in the Province of
   Ontario in Canada demonstrates the feasibility of estimating
   interregional trade flows from commercial vehicle survey data and shows
   that the estimated pattern of trade flows is maintained after
   adjustments are made to satisfy accounting constraints. Therefore, it is
   possible to create a balanced multi-regional input-output model based on
   a commercial vehicle survey and the limited supplementary data available
   at the regional level.}},

   remove all side-channels from the measurement unit, arguably the most
   vulnerable part in QKD systems, thus offering a clear avenue toward
   secure QKD realisations. Here, we review the latest developments in the

Abstract = {{Beamforming in series-fed antenna arrays can inherently suffer from
   beam-squinting. To overcome the beam-squinting problem, low-dispersion,
   fast-wave transmission lines can be employed. Such transmission lines
   can be designed by loading a regular transmission line with non-Foster
   reactive elements (e. g., negative capacitors and inductors). As a
   result of a recent development, these non-Foster reactive elements can
   be implemented using loss-compensated negative-group-delay (NGD)
   networks, providing a solution to the stability issues associated with
   conventional non-Foster networks. In this work, transmission lines
   augmented by loss-compensated NGD networks, representing the non-Foster
   reactive-element loading, are employed for designing wideband fast-wave,
   low-dispersion transmission lines. This work consolidates this
   non-Foster reactive element loading method with earlier efforts where
   NGD networks were used to implement zero-degree phase shifters for
   beamforming at the broadside direction, and generalizes these methods
   for arbitrary-angle beamforming from backfire to endfire including the
   broadside direction. Experimental results are presented for a wideband
   linear four-element transmitting array feed network for beamforming at
   30 degrees with respect to the broadside direction in the frequency
   range 1-1.5 GHz. By connecting this feed network to four wideband
   tapered-slot antennas, the beamforming performance is experimentally
   verified inside an anechoic chamber. Moreover, the antenna array is
   experimentally tested for transmission of a narrow pulse, where low
   distortion is observed at the beamforming angle over the entire
   operating bandwidth. The physical length of the feed network is
   realistic and is 0.96 wavelengths long at the center of this frequency
   range. In addition, switched-line phase shifters are employed for
   squint-free beamforming in three other angles: 60 degrees, 0 degrees,
   and -30 degrees.}},

Abstract = {{A visualization system to observe crystal and bubble formation in
   polymers under high temperature and pressure has been developed. Using
   this system, polymer can be subjected to a programmable thermal
   treatment to simulate the process in high pressure differential scanning
   calorimetry (HPDSC). With a high-temperature/high-pressure view-cell
   unit, this system enables in situ observation of crystal formation in
   semi-crystalline polymers to complement thermal analyses with HPDSC. The
   high-speed recording capability of the camera not only allows detailed
   recording of crystal formation, it also enables in situ capture of
   plastic foaming processes with a high temporal resolution. To
   demonstrate the system's capability, crystal formation and foaming
   processes of polypropylene/carbon dioxide systems were examined. It was
   observed that crystals nucleated and grew into spherulites, and they
   grew at faster rates as temperature decreased. This observation agrees
   with the crystallinity measurement obtained with the HPDSC. Cell
   nucleation first occurred at crystals' boundaries due to CO2 exclusion
   from crystal growth fronts. Subsequently, cells were nucleated around
   the existing ones due to tensile stresses generated in the constrained
   amorphous regions between networks of crystals.}},

Abstract = {{We consider the impact of compiler optimizations on the quality of
   high-level synthesis (HLS)-generated field-programmable gate array
   (FPGA) hardware. Using an HLS tool implemented within the
   state-of-the-art LLVM compiler, we study the effect of compiler
   optimizations on the hardware metrics of circuit area, execution cycles,
   FMax, and wall-clock time. We evaluate 56 different compiler
   optimizations implemented within LLVM and show that some optimizations
   significantly affect hardware quality. Moreover, we show that hardware
   quality is also affected by some optimization parameter values, as well
   as the order in which optimizations are applied. We then present a new
   HLS-directed approach to compiler optimizations, wherein we execute
   partial HLS and profiling at intermittent points in the optimization
   process and use the results to judiciously undo the impact of
   optimization passes predicted to be damaging to the generated hardware
   quality. Results show that our approach produces circuits with 16\%
   better speed performance, on average, versus using the standard -03
   optimization level.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are an attractive thin-film material for
   photovoltaic applications due to low material costs, ease of
   fabrication, and size-tunable band gap. Unfortunately, today they suffer
   from a compromise between light absorption and photocarrier extraction,
   a fact that currently prevents the complete harvest of incoming
   above-band-gap solar photons. We have investigated the use of structured
   substrates and/or electrodes to increase the effective light path
   through the active material and found that these designs require highly
   conformal application of the light-absorbing films to achieve the
   greatest enhancement. This conformality requirement derives from the
   need for maximal absorption enhancement combined with shortest-distance
   charge transport. Here we report on a means of processing highly
   conformal layer-by-layer deposited CQD absorber films onto
   microstructured, light-recycling electrodes. Specifically, we engineer
   surface hydrophilicity to achieve conformal deposition of upper layers
   atop underlying ones. We show that only with the application of
   conformal coating can we achieve optimal quantum efficiency and enhanced
   power conversion efficiency in structured-electrode CQD cells.}},

Abstract = {{Analysis and literature review have indicated that transportation
   agencies often report significant percentage of missing values of
   traffic volumes collected at permanent data collection stations (PDCS).
   These missing values can be as high as 60\% in some cases. Although
   invested significantly in legacy systems that rely primarily on
   inductive loop detectors to collect traffic volumes, transportation
   agencies are faced with a challenge of relying only on a small set of
   the traffic data. Despite the fact that transportation agencies are
   often required to report on various annual traffic statistics such as
   average annual daily traffic (AADT) and vehicles miles travelled, little
   research is available on how transportation practitioners handled
   missing values in their traffic data collection efforts. In this paper,
   a simple iterative approach is introduced-based on the integration of an
   imputation algorithm and a time series model - to impute missing PDCS
   data. The approach is deigned such that the imputation algorithm is
   implemented first to impute relatively small to medium gaps forming a
   library of complete datasets; then a time series model is fitted to
   these stations to form the base for imputing large gaps. The data
   imputation algorithm is applied on a case study on Ministry of
   Transportation of Ontario PDCS stations, Canada. The average errors for
   imputing as high as 90\% of missing data - with maximum continuous gaps
   of 76 h - were approximately 16\% with an average median error of 11
   veh/h. After all traffic data are imputed, a time series model is
   estimated to capture the multiple seasonalities and trends in the
   traffic data across multiple years. The estimated ``model{''} is then
   used to calculate and produce seasonal variation factors and graphs that
   are typically required for planning, design, control, operation, and
   management of traffic and highway facilities. By estimating the model
   parameters using existing raw data, the model was then tested to assess
   its accuracy to forecast future years.}},

Abstract = {{Solution-processed planar perovskite devices are highly desirable in a
   wide variety of optoelectronic applications; however, they are prone to
   hysteresis and current instabilities. Here we report the first
   perovskite-PCBM hybrid solid with significantly reduced hysteresis and
   recombination loss achieved in a single step. This new material displays
   an efficient electrically coupled microstructure: PCBM is homogeneously
   distributed throughout the film at perovskite grain boundaries. The PCBM
   passivates the key PbI3- antisite defects during the perovskite
   self-assembly, as revealed by theory and experiment. Photoluminescence
   transient spectroscopy proves that the PCBM phase promotes electron
   extraction. We showcase this mixed material in planar solar cells that
   feature low hysteresis and enhanced photovoltage. Using conductive AFM
   studies, we reveal the memristive properties of perovskite films. We
   close by positing that PCBM, by tying up both halide-rich antisites and
   unincorporated halides, reduces electric field-induced anion migration
   that may give rise to hysteresis and unstable diode behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{The determination of the specific surface area and pore structure
   parameters of natural materials have been a long-standing issue. We
   propose a method for determining the specific surface area and pore size
   distribution that is based on the zeta adsorption isotherm and apply
   that method for each of two hydrocarbon vapors, octane and heptane,
   adsorbing on two types of shale, as-received and milled shale. We
   determined the specific surface areas of both materials, approximate the
   pores as cylindrical, and determine the average pore mouth radius. The
   standard deviation in the mean values of the specific surface areas and
   average pore radius determined with each of the two vapors is less than
   3\%. The experimental isotherms on the as-received shale indicate the
   existence of a pronounced adsorption-desorption hysteresis loop that
   results from the mesoporous structure of the material. We previously
   showed that liquid forms in the pores because of coalescence of
   molecular clusters inside the pores. In this study, we show that the
   pore emptying in the as-received shale is delayed because of the pore
   blocking effect. The zeta isotherm theory and the necessary conditions
   for thermodynamic equilibrium along with the measured amount adsorbed
   are used to determine the distribution in the pore mouth radii.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, crude oil characterization based on surface plasmon
   resonance (SPR) is demonstrated. Oil characterization plays a crucial
   role in both the upstream and downstream oil industry. The application
   of SPR to these opaque, high index fluids is made possible here using
   infrared light (lambda = 1550 nm) for which crude oil is largely
   transparent, coupled through a high-index prism. Bitumen-toluene mixture
   tests show a measurement sensitivity of 74 degrees RIU-1 and a limit of
   detection below 1\% toluene. Seven crude oils from around the world are
   differentiated with refractive indices (RIs) spanning 1.44-1,56, with a
   sensor limit of detection of 0.0006 RIU. These results indicate a
   significant potential for SPR as a non-intrusive, fast, and simple
   technique for crude oil characterization applicable to reservoirs,

Abstract = {{This paper analyzes the impact of user mobility in multi-tier
   heterogeneous networks. We begin by obtaining the handoff rate for a
   mobile user in an irregular cellular network with the access point
   locations modeled as a homogeneous Poisson point process. The received
   signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR) distribution along with a chosen SIR
   threshold is then used to obtain the probability of coverage. To capture
   potential connection failures due to mobility, we assume that a fraction
   of handoffs result in such failures. Considering a multi-tier network
   with orthogonal spectrum allocation among tiers and the maximum biased
   average received power as the tier association metric, we derive the
   probability of coverage for two cases: 1) the user is stationary (i.e.,
   handoffs do not occur, or the system is not sensitive to handoffs); 2)
   the user is mobile, and the system is sensitive to handoffs. We derive
   the optimal bias factors to maximize the coverage. We show that when the
   user is mobile, and the network is sensitive to handoffs, both the
   optimum tier association and the probability of coverage depend on the
   user's speed; a speed-dependent bias factor can then adjust the tier
   association to effectively improve the coverage, and hence system
   performance, in a fully-loaded network.}},

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE The clinical heterogeneity of schizophrenia has hindered
   neurobiological investigations aimed at identifying neural correlates of
   the disorder.
   OBJECTIVE To identify network-based biomarkers across the spectrum of
   impairment present in schizophrenia by separately evaluating individuals
   with deficit and nondeficit subtypes of this disorder.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A university hospital network-based
   neuroimaging study was conducted between February 1, 2007, and February
   28, 2012. Participants included patients with schizophrenia (n = 128)
   and matched healthy controls (n = 130) from two academic centers and
   patients with bipolar I disorder (n = 39) and matched healthy controls
   (n = 43) from a third site. Patients with schizophrenia at each site in
   the top quartile on the proxy scale for the deficit syndrome were
   classified as having deficit schizophrenia and those in the bottom
   quartile were classified as having nondeficit schizophrenia.
   EXPOSURE All participants underwent magnetic resonance brain imaging.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Network-level properties of cortical
   thickness were assessed in each group. Interregional cortexwide coupling
   was compared among the groups, and graph theoretical approaches were
   used to assess network density and node degree, betweenness, closeness,
   and eigenvector centrality.
   RESULTS Stronger frontoparietal and frontotemporal coupling was found in
   patients with deficit schizophrenia compared with those with nondeficit
   schizophrenia (17 of 1326 pairwise relationships were significantly
   different, P < .05; 5\% false discovery rate) and in patients with
   deficit schizophrenia compared with healthy controls (49 of 1326
   pairwise relationships were significantly different, P < .05; 5\% false
   discovery rate). Participants with nondeficit schizophrenia and bipolar
   I disorder did not show significant differences in coupling relative to
   those in the control groups (for both comparisons, 0 of 1326 pairwise
   relationships were significantly different, P > .05; 5\% false discovery
   rate). The networks formed from patients with deficit schizophrenia
   demonstrated increased density of connections relative to controls and
   nondeficit patients (range, 0.07-0.45 in controls, 0.09-0.43 in the
   nondeficit group, and 0.18-0.67 in the deficit group). High centrality
   nodes were identified in the supramarginal, middle, and superior
   temporal and inferior frontal regions in deficit schizophrenia networks
   based on ranking of 4 centrality metrics. High centrality regions were
   identified as those that ranked in the top 10 in 50\% or more of the
   thresholded networks in 3 or more of the centrality measures. Network
   properties were similar in patients with deficit schizophrenia from both
   study sites.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Patients with schizophrenia at one end of a
   spectrum show characteristic signatures of altered intracortical
   relationships compared with those at the other end of that spectrum,
   patients with bipolar I disorder, and healthy individuals. Cortical
   connectomic approaches can be used to reliably identify neural
   signatures in clinically heterogeneous groups of patients.}},

Title = {{Robust optimization methods for cardiac sparing in tangential breast

Abstract = {{Purpose: In left-sided tangential breast intensity modulated radiation
   therapy (IMRT), the heart may enter the radiation field and receive
   excessive radiation while the patient is breathing. The patient's
   breathing pattern is often irregular and unpredictable. We verify the
   clinical applicability of a heart-sparing robust optimization approach
   for breast IMRT. We compare robust optimized plans with clinical plans
   at free-breathing and clinical plans at deep inspiration breath-hold
   (DIBH) using active breathing control (ABC).
   Methods: Eight patients were included in the study with each patient
   simulated using 4D-CT. The 4D-CT image acquisition generated ten
   breathing phase datasets. An average scan was constructed using all the
   phase datasets. Two of the eight patients were also imaged at
   breath-hold using ABC. The 4D-CT datasets were used to calculate the
   accumulated dose for robust optimized and clinical plans based on
   deformable registration. We generated a set of simulated breathing
   probability mass functions, which represent the fraction of time
   patients spend in different breathing phases. The robust optimization
   method was applied to each patient using a set of dose-influence
   matrices extracted from the 4D-CT data and a model of the breathing
   motion uncertainty. The goal of the optimization models was to minimize
   the dose to the heart while ensuring dose constraints on the target were
   achieved under breathing motion uncertainty.
   Results: Robust optimized plans were improved or equivalent to the
   clinical plans in terms of heart sparing for all patients studied. The
   robust method reduced the accumulated heart dose (D10cc) by up to 801
   cGy compared to the clinical method while also improving the coverage of
   the accumulated whole breast target volume. On average, the robust
   method reduced the heart dose (D10cc) by 364 cGy and improved the
   optBreast dose (D99\%) by 477 cGy. In addition, the robust method had
   smaller deviations from the planned dose to the accumulated dose. The
   deviation of the accumulated dose from the planned dose for the
   optBreast (D99\%) was 12 cGy for robust versus 445 cGy for clinical. The
   deviation for the heart (D10cc) was 41 cGy for robust and 320 cGy for
   clinical.
   Conclusions: The robust optimization approach can reduce heart dose
   compared to the clinical method at free-breathing and can potentially
   reduce the need for breath-hold techniques. (C) 2015 American

Abstract = {{The gluco-oligosaccharide oxidase from Sarocladium strictum CBS 346.70
   (GOOX) is a single domain flavoenzyme that favourably oxidizes gluco-
   and xylo-oligosaccharides. In the present study, GOOX was shown to also
   oxidize plant polysaccharides, including cellulose, glucomannan, beta-(1
   -> 3,1 -> 4)-glucan, and xyloglucan, albeit to a lesser extent than
   oligomeric substrates. To improve GOOX activity on polymeric substrates,
   three carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) from Clostridium thermocellum,
   namely CtCBM3 (type A), CtCBM11 (type B), and CtCBM44 (type B), were
   separately appended to the amino and carboxy termini of the enzyme,
   generating six fusion proteins. With the exception of GOOX-CtCBM3 and
   GOOX-CtCBM44, fusion of the selected CBMs increased the catalytic
   activity of the enzyme (kcat) on cellotetraose by up to 50\%. All CBM
   fusions selectively enhanced GOOX binding to soluble and insoluble
   polysaccharides, and the immobilized enzyme on a solid cellulose surface
   remained stable and active. In addition, the CBM fusions increased the
   activity of GOOX on soluble glucomannan by up to 30\% and on insoluble
   crystalline as well as amorphous cellulose by over 50 \%.}},

Abstract = {{Pediatric cranial radiation therapy can induce long-term neurocognitive
   deficits, the risk and severity of these deficits are amplified in
   females and in those individuals exposed at a younger age and/or those
   irradiated at higher doses. To investigate the developmental
   consequences of these factors in greater detail, male and female
   C57Bl/6J mice between infancy and late childhood (16 and 36 days) were
   irradiated at a single time point with a whole-brain dose of 0, 3, 5 or
   7 Gy. In vivo and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   deformation-based morphometry was used to identify radiation-induced
   volume differences. As expected, exposure to 7 Gy of radiation at 16
   days of age induced widespread volume deficits that were largely
   mitigated by increasing treatment age or decreasing dose. Notable
   exceptions were regions in the olfactory bulbs and hippocampus that
   displayed both a detectable difference in volume and a loss in
   neurogenesis for most doses and ages. Furthermore, white matter regions
   located at the front of the brain remained sensitive to radiation at
   later treatment ages, compared to regions at the back. Differences due
   to sex were subtle, with increased radiosensitivity in females
   detectable only in the mammillary bodies and fornix. Our results reveal
   anatomical alterations in brain development consistent with expectations
   based on pediatric patient neurocognitive outcomes. This data
   demonstrates that neuroimaging of the mouse is an effective tool for
   investigating radiation-induced late effects. (C) 2015 by Radiation

Abstract = {{When exposed to high osmolarity, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
   aureus (MRSA) restores its growth and establishes a new steady state by
   accumulating the osmoprotectant metabolite betaine. Effective
   osmoregulation has also been implicated in the acquirement of a profound
   antibiotic resistance by MRSA. Betaine can be obtained from the
   bacterial habitat or produced intracellularly from choline via the toxic
   betaine aldehyde (BA) employing the choline dehydrogenase and betaine
   aldehyde dehydrogenase (BADH) enzymes. Here, it is shown that the
   putative betaine aldehyde dehydrogenase SACOL2628 from the early MRSA
   isolate COL (SaBADH) utilizes betaine aldehyde as the primary substrate
   and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) as the cofactor. Surface
   plasmon resonance experiments revealed that the affinity of NAD(+), NADH
   and BA for SaBADH is affected by temperature, pH and buffer composition.
   Five crystal structures of the wild type and three structures of the
   Gly234Ser mutant of SaBADH in the apo and holo forms provide details of
   the molecular mechanisms of activity and substrate
   specificity/inhibition of this enzyme.}},

Abstract = {{We aim to examine the potential of using analogies in design education
   and to compare the roles of analogies in explaining versus inspiring in
   engineering design. We review existing research in analogical thinking,
   with a focus on scientific discourse and education. Then we explore the
   role of analogies in design education in making concepts more relatable
   by asking six participants in a graduate-level design course to generate
   analogies for course topics. We describe criteria developed to evaluate
   the analogies and present these evaluations. We then asked participants
   to perform divergent thinking tests, but we found no significant
   correlation between these and analogy scores. The participants were also
   asked to reflect on what constitutes an effective analog, describe their
   process of identifying analogies, and provide their definitions of
   analogies. We describe possible links between these comments and the
   ratings of their analogies. We then draw on results in using analogies
   in pedagogy to inform and reflect on obstacles we encountered in the use
   of analogies to inspire. Specifically, we related them to our experience
   with biomimetic or biologically inspired design, where we used a
   natural-language search approach to identify relevant analogies. Three
   aspects discussed are familiarity of source analogies, boundaries of
   parallels between source analogies and target concepts, and concreteness
   of source analogies. Finally, we discuss possible pedagogical benefits
   of eliciting analogies on course topics from students, namely, using the
   elicited analogies as tools for improved student engagement as well as
   more prompt instructor feedback.}},

Journal = {{AUTOMATICA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{55}},
Pages = {{108-115}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The paper studies the reach control problem (RCP) to make trajectories
   of an affine system defined on a polytopic state space reach and exit a
   prescribed facet of the polytope in finite time without first leaving
   the polytope. We introduce the notion of a flow function, which provides
   the analog of a Lyapunov function for the equilibrium stability problem.
   A flow function comprises a scalar function that decreases along
   closed-loop trajectories, and its existence is a necessary and
   sufficient condition for closed-loop trajectories to exit the polytope.
   It provides an analysis tool for determining if a specific instance of
   RCP is solved, without the need for calculating the state trajectories
   of the closed-loop system. Results include a variant of the LaSalle
   Principle tailored to RCP. An open problem is to identify suitable
   classes of flow functions. We explore functions of the form V(x) =
   max\{V-i(x)\}, and we give evidence that these functions arise naturally
   when RCP is solved using continuous piecewise affine feedbacks. Next we
   introduce the notion of a control flow function. It is shown that the
   Artstein-Sontag theorem of control Lyapunov functions has direct
   analogies to RCP via control flow functions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Absolute pitch (AP), the ability to identify a musical pitch without a
   reference, has been examined behaviorally in numerous studies for more
   than a century, yet only a few studies have examined the neuroanatomical
   correlates of AP. Here, we used MRI and diffusion tensor imaging to
   investigate structural differences in brains of musicians with and
   without AP, by means of whole-brain vertex-wise cortical thickness (CT)
   analysis and tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) analysis. APs
   displayed increased CT in a number of areas including the bilateral
   superior temporal gyrus (STG), the left inferior frontal gyrus, and the
   right supramarginal gyrus. Furthermore, we found higher fractional
   anisotropy in APs within the path of the inferior fronto-occipital
   fasciculus, the uncinate fasciculus, and the inferior longitudinal
   fasciculus. The findings in gray matter support previous studies
   indicating an increased left lateralized posterior STG in APs, yet they
   differ from previous findings of thinner cortex for a number of areas in
   APs. Finally, we found a relation between the whitematter results and
   the CT in the right parahippocampal gyrus. In this study, we present
   novel findings in AP research that may have implications for the
   understanding of the neuroanatomical underpinnings of AP ability.}},

   showed high extinction ratios at 1 THz of 25 dB and 40 dB, respectively.
   Furthermore, the transmittance of the 40 m CNTA sheet for THz
   polarization parallel to the carbon nanotubes decreased with increasing
   frequency, resulting in an extinction ratio of 34 dB at 2 THz exceeding

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose an optimal Bayesian control policy with two
   sampling intervals minimizing the long-run expected average maintenance
   cost per unit time for a partially observable deteriorating system.
   Unlike the previous optimal Bayesian approaches which used periodic
   sampling models with equidistant intervals, a novel sampling methodology
   is proposed which is characterized by two sampling intervals and two
   control thresholds. The deterioration process is modeled as a 3-state
   continuous time hidden-Markov process with two unobservable
   operating-states and an observable failure state. At each sampling
   epoch, the multivariate observation data provides only partial
   information about the actual state of the system. We start observing the
   system with a longer sampling interval. If the posterior probability
   that the system is in the warning state exceeds a warning limit,
   observations are taken more frequently, i.e., the sampling interval
   changes to a shorter one, and if the posterior probability exceeds a
   maintenance limit, the full inspection is performed, followed possibly
   by preventive maintenance. We formulate the maintenance control problem
   in a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework to
   find the two optimal control limits and two sampling intervals. Also,
   the mean residual life (MRL) of the system is calculated as a function
   of the posterior probability. A numerical example is provided and
   comparison of the proposed scheme with several alternative sampling and
   maintenance control strategies is carried out.}},

Abstract = {{Mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) can influence the destiny of
   hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSCs) and exert broadly
   immunomodulatory effects on immune cells. However, how MSCs regulate the
   differentiation of regulatory dendritic cells (regDCs) from HSCs remains
   incompletely understood. In this study, we show that mouse bone
   marrow-derived Sca-1(+)Lin(-)CD117(-) MSCs can drive HSCs to
   differentiate into a novel IFN regulatory factor (IRF) 8-controlled
   regDC population (Sca(+) BM-MSC-driven DC {[}sBM-DCs]) when cocultured
   without exogenous cytokines. The Notch pathway plays a critical role in
   the generation of the sBM-DCs by controlling IRF8 expression in an
   RBP-J-dependent way. We observed a high level of H3K27me3 methylation
   and a low level of H3K4me3 methylation at the Irf8 promoter during
   sBM-DC induction. Importantly, infusion of sBM-DCs could alleviate
   colitis in mice with inflammatory bowel disease by inhibiting lymphocyte
   proliferation and increasing the numbers of CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T
   cells. Thus, these data infer a possible mechanism for the development
   of regDCs and further support the role of MSCs in treating immune
   disorders.}},

   Dynamic Performance of High-Rise Buildings}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF STRUCTURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{141}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{A new damping system, the viscoelastic coupling damper (VCD), has been
   developed to enhance the wind and seismic performance of coupled shear
   wall high-rise buildings by adding high damping elements in place of
   reinforced concrete coupling beams. VCDs replace structural members,
   such as outriggers or coupling beams, and therefore do not occupy any
   usable architectural space. When they are properly configured in
   high-rise buildings, they provide supplemental viscous damping to all
   lateral modes of vibration, which mitigates building tenant vibration
   perception problems and reduces both the wind and earthquake response.
   Experimental results from tests on five small-scale viscoelastic (VE)
   damper specimens of 5- and 10-mm thicknesses are first presented,
   followed by the results from six full-scale VCDs representing two
   alternative configurations. The first was designed for areas where
   moderate seismic ductility is required, and the second was designed with
   built-in ductile structural fuses for areas where high seismic ductility
   is required. The VE material tests exhibited stable hysteretic behavior
   under the loading conditions that are expected in high-rise buildings
   under wind and earthquake loading. The full-scale tests validated the
   overall system performance within a realistic coupled wall
   configuration, and confirmed the performance of the wall anchorages and
   all connecting elements as well as the VE material behavior. The
   full-scale test results also demonstrated the targeted viscoelastic
   response during wind and low level earthquake loading and the targeted
   viscoelastic-plastic response for extreme earthquakes, where the
   response is a combination of the VE response and the nonlinear behavior
   of the structural fuses.}},

Abstract = {{Cys2-His2 zinc finger (C2H2-ZF) proteins represent the largest class of
   putative human transcription factors. However, for most C2H2-ZF proteins
   it is unknown whether they even bind DNA or, if they do, to which
   sequences. Here, by combining data from a modified bacterial one-hybrid
   system with protein-binding microarray and chromatin immunoprecipitation
   analyses, we show that natural C2H2-ZFs encoded in the human genome bind
   DNA both in vitro and in vivo, and we infer the DNA recognition code
   using DNA-binding data for thousands of natural C2H2-ZF domains. In vivo
   binding data are generally consistent with our recognition code and
   indicate that C2H2-ZF proteins recognize more motifs than all other
   human transcription factors combined. We provide direct evidence that
   most KRAB-containing C2H2-ZF proteins bind specific endogenous
   retroelements (EREs), ranging from currently active to ancient families.
   The majority of C2H2-ZF proteins, including KRAB proteins, also show
   widespread binding to regulatory regions, indicating that the human
   genome contains an extensive and largely unstudied adaptive C2H2-ZF
   regulatory network that targets a diverse range of genes and pathways.}},

Abstract = {{The physical forces that drive morphogenesis are not well characterized
   in vivo, especially among vertebrates. In the early limb bud, dorsal and
   ventral ectoderm converge to form the apical ectodermal ridge (AER),
   although the underlying mechanisms are unclear. By live imaging mouse
   embryos, we show that prospective AER progenitors intercalate at the
   dorsoventral boundary and that ectoderm remodels by concomitant cell
   division and neighbour exchange. Mesodermal expansion and ectodermal
   tension together generate a dorsoventrally biased stress pattern that
   orients ectodermal remodelling. Polarized distribution of cortical actin
   reflects this stress pattern in a beta-catenin-and Fgfr2-dependent
   manner. Intercalation of AER progenitors generates a tensile gradient
   that reorients resolution of multicellular rosettes on adjacent
   surfaces, a process facilitated by beta-catenin-dependent attachment of
   cortex to membrane. Therefore, feedback between tissue stress pattern
   and cell intercalations remodels mammalian ectoderm.}},

Abstract = {{A new method for generating high-repetition-rate (12.7-38.2 MHz) burst
   trains of femtosecond laser pulses has been demonstrated for the purpose
   of tailoring ultrashort laser interactions in material processing that
   can harness the heat accumulation effect among pulses separated by a
   short interval (i.e., 26 ns). Computer-controlled time delays were
   applied to synchronously trigger the high frequency switching of a high
   voltage Pockels cell to specify distinctive values of polarization
   rotation for each round-trip of a laser pulse cycling within a passive
   resonator. Polarization dependent output coupling facilitated the
   flexible shaping of the burst envelope profile to provide burst trains
   of up to similar to 1 mJ of burst energy divided over a selectable
   number (1 to 25) of pulses. Individual pulses of variable energy up to
   150 mu J and with pulse duration tunable over 70 fs to 2 ps, were
   applied in burst trains to generate deep and high aspect ratio holes
   that could not form with low-repetition-rate laser pulses. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{A critical aspect of creating vascularized tissues is the remodelling
   that occurs in vivo, driven in large part by the host response to the
   tissue construct. Rather than a simple inflammatory response, a
   beneficial tissue remodelling response results in the formation of
   vascularised tissue. The characteristics and dynamics of this response
   are slowly being elucidated, especially as they are modulated by the
   complex interaction between the biomaterial and cellular components of
   the tissue constructs and the host. This process has elements that are
   similar to both wound healing and tumour development, and its features
   are illustrated by reference to the bottom-up generation of a tissue
   using modular constructs. These modular constructs consist of
   mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) embedded in endothelial cell
   (EC)-covered collagen gel rods that are a few hundred microns in size.
   Particular attention is paid to the role of hypoxia and macrophage
   recruitment, as well as the paracrine effects of the MSC and EC in this
   host response.}},

Abstract = {{The paper considers a maintenance problem in the presence of competing
   risks (soft and hard failure) for a degrading system subject to
   condition monitoring at equidistant, discrete time epochs. A
   random-coefficient autoregressive model with time effect is developed to
   describe the system degradation. The system age, previous state
   observations, and the item-to-item variability of the degradation are
   jointly combined in the proposed degradation model. The failure rate
   corresponding to the hard failure is characterized by its dependency on
   the system age and the degradation state. We propose a maintenance
   policy which initiates preventive maintenance when the failure rate of
   the hard failure reaches a certain threshold. Computational algorithms
   for the optimization of the maintenance policy are developed in a
   semi-Markov decision process framework, with the objective of minimizing
   the long-run expected average cost. The effectiveness of the proposed
   method is demonstrated by numerical examples. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Gingival atrophy manifests as exposure of the tooth root surface because
   of recession of the gingiva, a condition that affects >20\% of adults
   and leads to increased root sensitivity and ultimately, tooth loss.
   Tissue engineering approaches that employ novel synthetic polymeric
   scaffolds are being considered for rebuilding the gingival lamina
   propria lost in the atrophic process. Specifically, polyurethane
   hydrogels (degradable/polar/hydrophobic/ionic polyurethane {[}D-PHI])
   can enhance the proliferation of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) and
   collagen production in a perfusion system. However, few studies have
   assessed the potential of synthetic block copolyurethanes to initiate
   blood vessel formation in an in vitro bioreactor system. As the gingival
   lamina propria is highly vascular, a coculture system of human umbilical
   vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with HGFs was used in perfused D-PHI
   scaffolds to determine the feasibility of initiating vascularization.
   Culture conditions were optimized for driving cocultures toward the
   desired tissue-engineered construct. HUVEC-HGF coculture in perfused
   D-PHI scaffolds with a cell seeding density of at least 80,000
   cells/scaffold in a 50/50 mix of HUVEC and HGF media (by volume)
   exhibited enhanced cell growth and increased vascular endothelial growth
   factor and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2 production, as well as
   reduced myofibroblast differentiation. A greater fibroblast proportion
   (seeding ratio of 1:2) in the coculture resulted in HUVEC cluster
   formations and increased transforming growth factor-beta 1 and FGF-2
   production. The combined pro-angiogenic effects provided by these
   culture conditions are anticipated to be important in the development of
   a highly vascularized tissue-engineered construct for regenerating the
   gingival lamina propria and possibly other soft tissues.}},

Abstract = {{A new adaptive beamforming algorithm for imaging via small-aperture 1-D
   ultrasonic-phased arrays through composite layered structures is
   reported. Such structures cause acoustic phase aberration and wave
   refraction at undulating interfaces and can lead to significant
   distortion of an ultrasonic field pattern produced by conventional
   beamforming techniques. This distortion takes the form of defocusing the
   ultrasonic field transmitted through the barrier and causes loss of
   resolution and overall degradation of image quality. To compensate for
   the phase aberration and the refractional effects, we developed and
   examined an adaptive beamforming algorithm for small-aperture
   linear-phased arrays. After accurately assessing the barrier's local
   geometry and sound speed, the method calculates a new timing scheme to
   refocus the distorted beam at its original location. As a tentative
   application, implementation of this method for trans-skull imaging of
   certain types of head injuries through human skull is discussed.
   Simulation and laboratory results of applying the method on
   skull-mimicking phantoms are presented. Correction of up to 2.5 cm focal
   point displacement at up to 10 cm depth under our skull phantom is
   demonstrated. Quantitative assessment of the method in a variety of
   temporal focusing scenarios is also reported. Overall temporal deviation
   on the order of a few nanoseconds was observed between the simulated and
   experimental results. The single-point adaptive focusing results
   demonstrate strong potential of our approach for diagnostic imaging
   through intact human skull. The algorithms were implemented on an
   ultrasound advanced open-platform controlling 64 active elements on a
   128-element phased array.}},

Abstract = {{The current diagnosis process of dementia is resulting in a high

   this paper, we explore the feasibility of autonomously detecting mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) in the older adult population. We implement a
   signal processing approach equipped with a machine learning paradigm to
   process and analyze real-world data acquired using home-based
   unobtrusive sensing technologies. Using the sensor and clinical data
   pertaining to 97 subjects, acquired over an average period of three
   years, a number of measures associated with the subjects' walking speed
   and general activity in the home were calculated. Different time spans
   of these measures were used to generate feature vectors to train and
   test two machine learning algorithms namely support vector machines and
   random forests. We were able to autonomously detect MCI in older adults
   with an area under the ROC curve of 0.97 and an area under the
   precision-recall curve of 0.93 using a time window of 24 weeks. This
   study is of great significance since it can potentially assist in the
   early detection of cognitive impairment in older adults.}},

   to encode glycoside hydrolase family 62 (GH62) enzymes. Transcriptome
   analysis showed that only abf62A and abf62C are actively expressed
   during growth on diverse substrates including straws from barley,
   alfalfa, triticale and canola. The abf62A and abf62C genes were
   expressed in Escherichia coli and the resulting recombinant proteins
   were characterized. Calcium-free crystal structures of Abf62C in apo and
   xylotriose bound forms were determined to 1.23 and 1.48 angstrom
   resolution respectively. Site-directed mutagenesis confirmed Asp55,
   Asp171 and Glu230 as catalytic triad residues, and revealed the critical
   role of non-catalytic residues Asp194, Trp229 and Tyr338 in positioning
   the scissile -L-arabinofuranoside bond at the catalytic site. Further,
   the +2R substrate-binding site residues Tyr168 and Asn339, as well as
   the +2NR residue Tyr226, are involved in accommodating long-chain xylan
   polymers. Overall, our structural and functional analysis highlights
   characteristic differences between Abf62A and Abf62C, which represent
   divergent subgroups in the GH62 family.}},

Abstract = {{Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) was previously
   used to characterize lignocellulosic materials, including woody biomass.
   ToF-SIMS can acquire both rapid spectral and spatial information about a
   sample's surface composition. In the present study, ToF-SIMS was used to
   characterize the cell walls of stem tissue from the plant model
   organism, Arabidopsis thaliana. Using principal component analyses,
   ToF-SIMS spectra from A. thaliana wild-type (Col-0), cellulose mutant
   (irx3), and lignin mutant (fah1) stem tissues were distinguished using
   ToF-SIMS peaks annotated for wood-derived lignocellulose, where spectra
   from the irx3 and fah1 were characterized by comparatively low
   polysaccharide and syringyl lignin content, respectively. Spatial
   analyses using ToF-SIMS imaging furthermore differentiated
   interfascicular fiber and xylem vessels based on differences in the
   lignin content of corresponding cell walls. These new data support the
   applicability of ToF-SIMS peak annotations based on woody biomass for
   herbaceous plants, including model plant systems like arabidopsis.

Abstract = {{Carsharing organizations are shared-mobility services which allow users
   to share vehicles of a fleet. These services are divided into one-way
   and two-way systems. Two-way systems require users to return the
   vehicles to their original pick up stations whereas one-ways systems do
   not. We present a hybrid system that has features of both. Two integer
   programming optimization models are formulated. The first model, called
   the fleet size problem (FSP), is for tactical planning and calculates
   the required fleet size in order to answer all the demand in various
   market segments where every market segment is composed of some
   direct-trip and some round-trip users. This model also accounts for
   vehicle relocation between stations. In reality, however, fleet size is
   fixed for day-to-day operations. With a specified fleet size, not all
   users are necessarily served unless the fleet size is quite large
   compared to the demand. Therefore, a second operational model, called
   profit maximization problem (PMP), selects from a list of user requests
   those who profit the service-provider the most. Data from Autoshare, a
   carsharing company in Toronto, is used to assess the models. Results of
   the FSP model indicate that one-way systems require the lowest fleet
   size but highest vehicle relocation hours. Two-way systems are
   relatively insensitive to the market segment and the hybrid system's
   performance is dependent on the market segment scenario. The PMP model
   shows that the one-way (two-way) system is most beneficial to
   direct-trip (round-trip) users. The hybrid system is the only system
   without user surplus costs.}},

Abstract = {{One major bottleneck in the practical implementation of received signal
   strength (RSS) based indoor localization systems is the extensive
   deployment efforts required to construct the radio maps through
   fingerprinting. In this paper, we aim to design an indoor localization
   scheme that can be directly employed without building a full
   fingerprinted radio map of the indoor environment. By accumulating the
   information of localized RSSs, this scheme can also simultaneously
   construct the radio map with limited calibration. To design this scheme,
   we employ a source data set that possesses the same spatial correlation
   of the RSSs in the indoor environment of interest. The knowledge of this
   data set is then transferred to a limited number of calibration
   fingerprints and one or several RSS observations with unknown locations,
   in order to perform direct localization of these observations using
   manifold alignment. We test two different source data sets, namely a
   simulated radio propagation map and the environment's plan coordinates.
   For moving users, we exploit the correlation of their observations to
   improve their localization accuracy. The online testing in two indoor
   environments shows that the plan coordinates achieve better results than
   the simulated radio maps, and a negligible degradation with 70-85
   percent reduction in the calibration load.}},

Abstract = {{Laser processing of shape memory alloys (SMAs) promises to enable the
   multifunctional capabilities needed for medical device applications.
   Prior to clinical implementation, the surface characterisation of laser
   processed SMA is essential in order to understand any adverse biological
   interaction that may occur. The current study systematically
   investigated two Ni-49.8 at.\% Ti SMA laser processed surface finishes,
   including as-processed and polished, while comparing them to a
   chemically etched parent material. Spectrographic characterisation of
   the surface included; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), auger
   electron spectroscopy (AES), and Raman spectroscopy. Corrosion
   performance and Ni ion release were also assessed using potentiodynamic
   cyclic polarization testing and inductively coupled plasma optical
   emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES), respectively. Results showed that
   surface defects, including increased roughness, crystallinity and
   presence of volatile oxide species, overshadowed any possible
   performance improvements from an increased Ti/Ni ratio or inclusion
   dissolution imparted by laser processing. However, post-laser process
   mechanical polishing was shown to remove these defects and restore the
   performance, making it comparable to chemically etched NiTi material.

Abstract = {{The mechanical performance of stretch-formed microtrusses is determined
   by both the internal strut architecture and the accumulated plastic
   strain during fabrication. The current study addresses the question of
   optimization, by taking into consideration the interdependency between
   fabrication path, material properties and architecture. Low carbon steel
   (AISI1006) and aluminum (AA3003) material systems were investigated
   experimentally, with good agreement between measured values and the
   analytical model. The compressive performance of the microtrusses was
   then optimized on a minimum weight basis under design constraints such
   as fixed starting sheet thickness and final microtruss height by
   satisfying the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition. The optimization results
   were summarized as carpet plots in order to meaningfully visualize the
   interdependency between architecture, microstructural state, and
   mechanical performance, enabling material and processing path selection.

   techniques that can extract the multi-scale pore space from micro
   computed tomography (microCT) or scanning electron microscopy (SEM) are
   needed. In this work, the application and evaluation of thresholding
   techniques originally developed for sandstones were applied and
   evaluated for Indiana Limestone and Pink Dolomite, carbonates that
   exhibit dual porosities (porosities that represent two distinct pore
   size distributions). The objective was to determine whether there is a
   single method or imaging technique that can reliably evaluate the
   porosity of carbonate rocks. The evaluation of the thresholding
   techniques applied to carbonate rocks showed that one single imaging
   technique or thresholding method cannot be solely used for all carbonate
   rocks. Instead, the evaluated porosity is a function of the
   microporosity, rock type and image resolution. The sensitivities of
   existing methods to thresholding techniques, imaging method and material
   structure were shown. This work provides a preliminary assessment of
   thresholding dual porosity carbonates. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{The poor management of human excreta in developing countries is among
   the most prominent global issues due to its negative impact on public
   health. This work demonstrates for the first time that self-sustaining
   smouldering of faeces mixed with sand is a feasible alternative to
   incineration for rapid destruction of waste. Self-sustaining smouldering
   requires minimal energy input and pre-drying of faeces compared to
   incineration. This process ensures the elimination of biological hazards
   via long residence times (>20 min) at high temperatures (>400 degrees
   C). Surrogate faeces which exhibits similar energetic, thermal, and
   mechanical properties to real faeces are used in this study. The
   parameters controlling the combustion process including moisture
   content, airflow rate, and sand-to-faeces ratio are mapped to establish
   the range of conditions where self-sustaining smouldering of faeces can
   be achieved. Experiments were conducted within the ranges 0-75\% for
   moisture content, 7-108 g/min for airflow rate and 2.75-11.9 g/g for
   sand-to-faeces (wet basis) ratio. Preliminary validation of the
   parameter space is done using real dog faeces. In this work, the
   parameter space defining the range of conditions where self-sustaining
   smouldering occurs is mapped. Results show successful self-sustaining
   smouldering of faeces for moisture contents of up to 60\%, airflow
   ranging from 10 to 100 g/min, and wet sand-to-faeces ratio greater than
   3.25. This proof-of-concept for a smouldering reactor to treat human
   solid waste demonstrates that smouldering of faeces could be the basis
   for a new, energy efficient waste treatment approach. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In this study, we consider the choice of a standard electron-donating
   material to be paired with boron subphthalocyanines (BsubPcs) to rapidly
   assess the viability of new BsubPc derivatives as electron-accepting
   materials within organic photovoltaic devices (OPVs). Specifically, we
   evaluate the effectiveness of solution-cast
   poly(3-hexylthiophene-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) as an electron donor paired with
   BsubPc derivatives relative to vacuum-deposited sexithiophene (-6T). By
   using fullerene (C-60), boron subphthalocyanine chloride (Cl-BsubPc),
   and hexachloro boron subphthalocyanine chloride (Cl-Cl(6)BsubPc) as
   electron acceptors, we find that devices made with -6T outperform those
   with P3HT. However, the two thiophene-based materials show the same
   performance trends. Given the preservation of these trends, we can
   recommend either option for assessing the potential of new BsubPc
   derivatives; P3HT as a solution-cast electron-donor layer or -6T as a

Abstract = {{This paper aims to comprehensively distinguish among the merits of
   different vehicles using a common primary energy source. In this study,
   we consider compressed natural gas (CNG) use directly in conventional
   vehicles (CV) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV), and natural
   gas-derived electricity (NG-e) use in plug-in battery electric vehicles
   (BEV). This study evaluates the incremental life cycle air emissions
   (climate change and human health) impacts and life cycle ownership costs
   of non-plug-in (CV and REV) and plug-in light-duty vehicles. Replacing a
   gasoline CV with a CNG CV, or a CNG CV with a CNG HEV, can provide life
   cycle air emissions impact benefits without increasing ownership costs;
   however, the NG-e BEV will likely increase costs (90\% confidence
   interval: \$1000 to \$31 000 incremental cost per vehicle lifetime).
   Furthermore, eliminating REV tailpipe emissions via plug-in vehicles has
   an insignificant incremental benefit, due to high uncertainties, with
   emissions cost benefits between \$1000 and \$2000. Vehicle criteria air
   contaminants are a relatively minor contributor to life cycle air
   emissions impacts because of strict vehicle emissions standards.
   Therefore, policies should focus on adoption of plug-in vehicles in
   nonattainment regions, because CNG vehicles are likely more
   cost-effective at providing overall life cycle air emissions impact
   benefits.}},

Abstract = {{Deformable image registration (DIR) has been extensively studied over
   the past two decades due to its essential role in many image-guided
   interventions (IGI). IGI demands a highly accurate registration that
   maintains its accuracy across the entire region of interest. This work
   evaluates the improvement in accuracy and consistency by refining the
   results of Morfeus, a biomechanical model-based DIR algorithm.
   A hybrid DIR algorithm is proposed based on, a biomechanical model-based
   DIR algorithm and a refinement step based on a B-spline intensity-based
   algorithm. Inhale and exhale reconstructions of four-dimensional
   computed tomography (4DCT) lung images from 31 patients were initially
   registered using the biomechanical DIR by modeling contact surface
   between the lungs and the chest cavity. The resulting deformations were
   then refined using the intensity-based algorithm to reduce any residual
   uncertainties. Important parameters in the intensity-based algorithm,
   including grid spacing, number of pyramids, and regularization
   coefficient, were optimized on 10 randomly-chosen patients (out of 31).
   Target registration error (TRE) was calculated by measuring the
   Euclidean distance of common anatomical points on both images after
   registration. For each patient a minimum of 30 points/lung were used.
   Grid spacing of 8 mm, 5 levels of grid pyramids, and regularization
   coefficient of 3.0 were found to provide optimal results on 10 randomly
   chosen patients. Overall the entire patient population (n = 31), the
   hybrid method resulted in mean +/- SD (90th\%) TRE of 1.5 +/- 1.4 (2.9)
   mm compared to 3.1 +/- 1.9 (5.6) using biomechanical DIR and 2.6 +/- 2.5
   (6.1) using intensity-based DIR alone.
   The proposed hybrid biomechanical modeling intensity based algorithm is
   a promising DIR technique which could be used in various IGI procedures.
   The current investigation shows the efficacy of this approach for the
   registration of 4DCT images of the lungs with average accuracy of 1.5
   mm.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a nonlinear wideband multi-mode piezoelectric
   vibration-based energy harvester (PVEH) is proposed based on a compliant
   orthoplanar spring (COPS), which has an advantage of providing multiple
   vibration modes at relatively low frequencies. The PVEH is made of a
   tri-leg COPS flexible structure, where three fixed-guided beams are
   capable of generating strong nonlinear oscillations under certain base
   excitation. A prototype harvester was fabricated and investigated
   through both finite-element analysis and experiments. The frequency
   response shows multiple resonance which corresponds to a hardening type
   of nonlinear resonance. By adding masses at different locations on the
   COPS structure, the first three vibration modes are brought close to
   each other, where the three hardening nonlinear resonances provide a
   wide bandwidth for the PVEH. The proposed PVEH has enhanced performance
   of the energy harvester in terms of a wide frequency bandwidth and a
   high-voltage output under base excitations. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Cell surface proteins are major targets of biomedical research due to
   their utility as cellular markers and their extracellular accessibility
   for pharmacological intervention. However, information about the cell
   surface protein repertoire (the surfaceome) of individual cells is only
   sparsely available. Here, we applied the Cell Surface Capture (CSC)
   technology to 41 human and 31 mouse cell types to generate a
   mass-spectrometry derived Cell Surface Protein Atlas (CSPA) providing
   cellular surfaceome snapshots at high resolution. The CSPA is presented
   in form of an easy-to-navigate interactive database, a downloadable data
   matrix and with tools for targeted surfaceome rediscovery
   (http://wlab.ethz.ch/cspa). The cellular surfaceome snapshots of
   different cell types, including cancer cells, resulted in a combined
   dataset of 1492 human and 1296 mouse cell surface glycoproteins,
   providing experimental evidence for their cell surface expression on
   different cell types, including 136 G-protein coupled receptors and 75
   membrane receptor tyrosine-protein kinases. Integrated analysis of the
   CSPA reveals that the concerted biological function of individual cell
   types is mainly guided by quantitative rather than qualitative
   surfaceome differences. The CSPA will be useful for the evaluation of
   drug targets, for the improved classification of cell types and for a
   better understanding of the surfaceome and its concerted biological
   functions in complex signaling microenvironments.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the microporous layer (MPL) of the polymer electrolyte
   membrane (PEM) fuel cell was analysed at the nano-scale. Atomic force
   microscopy (AFM) was utilized to image the top layer of MPL particles,
   and a curve fitting algorithm was used to determine the particle size
   and filling radius distributions for SGL-10BB and SGL-10BC. The
   particles in SGL-10BC (approximately 60 nm in diameter) have been found
   to be larger than those in SGL-10BB (approximately 40 nm in diameter),
   highlighting structural variability between the two materials. The
   impact of the MPL particle interactions on the effective thermal
   conductivity of the bulk MPL was analysed using a discretization of the
   Fourier equation with the Gauss-Seidel iterative method. It was found
   that the particle spacing and filling radius dominates the effective
   thermal conductivity, a result which provides valuable insight for
   future MPL design. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{A rational approach to defining principal axes of multidirectional wall

Abstract = {{The distribution of arterial lesions is attributed by the prevalent
   mechanistic theory to the proatherogenic role played by low and
   oscillatory wall shear stress (WSS). However, discrepancies observed
   when comparing WSS distribution with location of regions with lesion
   prevalence challenge this theory and have recently stimulated the idea
   that a role in endothelial mechanosensing is played by WSS
   multidirectionality, which could contribute to explain the observed
   discrepancies.
   Here an approach is presented for analyzing the multidirectional nature
   of WSS in complex vascular geometries. Using an essential geometric
   attribute of the vessel (its centerline), the local WSS vector is
   projected along an ``axial{''} direction (aligned with the tangent to
   the vessel's centerline), and ``secondary{''} direction (orthogonal to
   centerline's tangent), which is related to secondary flow. The WSS
   projection scheme is applied: (1) to a realistic computational
   hemodynamic model of human aorta, with the aim to come up with a
   plausibility checking regarding its consistency; and (2) to investigate
   if an aortic hemodynamics characterized by different amount and topology
   of helical flow (HF) could influence WSS directionality.
   The projection scheme confirmed its consistency and plausibility in
   realistic arterial geometries and allowed to get insight into the
   relationship between aortic intravascular fluid structures and WSS
   directionality. The findings of this study clearly show the potential of
   the projection scheme as quantitative tool for an in depth investigation
   of the WSS multidirectional nature. The proposed approach enriches the
   arsenal of tools available to study and exploit the role played by local
   hemodynamics in vascular disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Current methods for the development of pelvic finite element (FE) models
   generally are based upon specimen specific computed tomography (CT)
   data. This approach has traditionally required segmentation of CT data
   sets, which is time consuming and necessitates high levels of user
   intervention due to the complex pelvic anatomy. The purpose of this
   research was to develop and assess CT landmark-based semi-automated mesh
   morphing and mapping techniques to aid the generation and mechanical
   analysis of specimen-specific FE models of the pelvis without the need
   for segmentation. A specimen-specific pelvic FE model (source) was
   created using traditional segmentation methods and morphed onto a CT
   scan of a different (target) pelvis using a landmark-based method. The
   morphed model was then refined through mesh mapping by moving the nodes
   to the bone boundary. A second target model was created using
   traditional segmentation techniques. CT intensity based material
   properties were assigned to the morphed/mapped model and to the
   traditionally segmented target models. Models were analyzed to evaluate
   their geometric concurrency and strain patterns. Strains generated in a
   double-leg stance configuration were compared to experimental strain
   gauge data generated from the same target cadaver pelvis. CT
   landmark-based morphing and mapping techniques were efficiently applied
   to create a geometrically multifaceted specimen-specific pelvic FE
   model, which was similar to the traditionally segmented target model and
   better replicated the experimental strain results (R-2=0.873). This
   study has shown that mesh morphing and mapping represents an efficient
   validated approach for pelvic FE model generation without the need for
   segmentation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Biphasic monopolar electrical stimulation induces rapid and directed
   galvanotaxis in adult subependymal neural precursors}},
Journal = {{STEM CELL RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR 12}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Following injury such as stroke, adult mammalian
   subependymal neural precursor cells (NPCs) are induced to proliferate
   and migrate toward the lesion site where they differentiate into neural
   cells, albeit with limited efficacy. We are interested in enhancing this
   migratory ability of NPCs with the long-term goal of promoting neural
   repair. Herein we build on our previous studies demonstrating that
   direct current electric fields (DCEFs) promote rapid and
   cathode-directed migration of undifferentiated adult NPCs (but not
   differentiated phenotypes) - a phenomenon known as galvanotaxis. While
   galvanotaxis represents a promising strategy to promote NPC recruitment
   to lesion sites, stimulation of neural tissue with DCEFs is not a
   clinically-viable strategy due to the associated accumulation of charge
   and toxic byproducts. Balanced biphasic waveforms prevent the
   accumulation of charge and thus are outside of the limitations of DCEFs.
   In this study, we investigated the effects of balanced biphasic
   electrical stimulation on the migratory behaviour of undifferentiated
   subependymal NPCs and their differentiated progeny.
   Methods: NPCs were isolated from the subependymal zone of adult mouse
   brains and cultured in a NPC colony-forming assay to form neurospheres.
   Neurospheres were plated onto galvanotaxis chambers in conditions that
   either promoted maintenance in an undifferentiated state or promoted
   differentiation into mature phenotypes. Chambers containing cells were
   then time-lapse imaged in the presence of either biphasic monopolar, or
   biphasic bipolar electrical stimulation, or in the complete absence of
   electrical stimulation. Single cell migration was subsequently tracked
   and the cells' magnitude of velocity, directedness and tortuosity were
   quantified.
   Results: We demonstrate, for the first time, the use of balanced
   biphasic electric fields to induce galvanotaxis of NPCs.
   Undifferentiated adult mouse subependymal NPCs exposed to biphasic
   monopolar stimulation undergo rapid and directed migration toward the
   cathode. In contrast, both biphasic bipolar stimulation and the lack of
   electrical stimulation produced non-directed migration of NPCs. Notably,
   NPCs induced to differentiate into mature phenotypes prior to exposure
   to electrical stimulation do not migrate in the presence or absence of
   biphasic stimulation.
   Conclusion: We purport that balanced biphasic stimulation represents a
   clinically-viable technique for mobilizing NPCs that may be integrated
   into strategies for promoting endogenous neurorepair.}},

Abstract = {{We develop an ozone transport and reaction model to determine reaction
   probabilities and assess the importance of physical properties such as
   porosity, pore diameter, and material thickness on reactive uptake of
   ozone to five materials. The one-dimensional model accounts for
   molecular diffusion from bulk air to the airmaterial interface, reaction
   at the interface, and diffusive transport and reaction through material
   pore volumes. Material-ozone reaction probabilities that account for
   internal transport and internal pore area, gamma(ipa), are determined by
   a minimization of residuals between predicted and experimentally derived
   ozone concentrations. Values of gamma(ipa) are generally less than
   effective reaction probabilities (gamma(eff)) determined previously,
   likely because of the inclusion of diffusion into substrates and
   reaction with internal surface area (rather than the use of the
   horizontally projected external material areas). Estimates of gamma(ipa)
   average 1 x 10(-7), 2 x 10(-7), 4 x 10(-5), 2 x 10(-5), and 4 x 10(-7)
   for two types of cellulose paper, pervious pavement, Portland cement
   concrete, and an activated carbon cloth, respectively. The transport and
   reaction model developed here accounts for observed differences in ozone
   removal to varying thicknesses of the cellulose paper, and estimates a
   near constant gamma(ipa) as material thickness increases from 0.02 to
   0.16 cm.}},

Abstract = {{A simple two-step method was used to produce efficient planar organolead
   halide perovskite solar cells. Films produced using solely iodine
   containing precursors resulted in poor morphology and failed devices,
   whereas addition of chlorine to the process greatly improved morphology
   and resulted in dense, uniform perovskite films. This process was used
   to produce perovskite solar cells with a fullerene-based passivation
   layer. The hysteresis effect, to which planar perovskite devices are
   otherwise prone, was greatly suppressed through the use of this
   interface modifier. The combined techniques resulted in perovskite solar
   cells having a stable efficiency exceeding 11\%. This straightforward
   fabrication procedure holds promise in development of various
   optoelectronic applications of planar perovskite films. (C) 2015 AIP

Journal = {{ECONOMIC SYSTEMS RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{27}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{172-193}},
Month = {{APR 3}},
Abstract = {{Many efforts have recently been devoted to developing global
   multi-region input-output (GMRIO) models. Unfortunately, the scales of
   GMRIO models do not allow them to capture the heterogeneity of regions
   within a single country. Multi-scale models can provide more
   comprehensive analyses capable of capturing the interdependencies of the
   global economy while preserving regional differences. The primary
   objective of this research is to develop methods for integrating
   multi-region input-output data sets from multiple spatial scales into
   multi-scale multi-region input-output (MSMRIO) models. These methods
   result in models that may have unusual features such as non-square trade
   coefficient matrices and a mix of industry-by-industry and
   commodity-by-commodity technical coefficients. To demonstrate the
   feasibility of MSMRIO modelling, a Canada-centric model was developed.
   This model includes 47 countries and Canada's 13 subnational regions. A
   MSMRIO model provides a tool to analyse global issues with a more
   spatially detailed focus.}},

Abstract = {{This paper utilizes socio-psychometric survey data to investigate the
   influence of attitudes, affective appraisal and habit formation on
   commuting mode choice. The data-set was collected in 2009-2010 in
   Edmonton, Alberta. In addition to conventional socio-economic,
   demographic and modal attributes, the survey gathered psychological
   information regarding habitual behaviour, affective appraisal and
   personal attitudes. Different psychometric tools were used to capture
   psychological factors affecting mode choice. Habitual behaviour was
   measured using Verplanken's response-frequency questionnaire. Affective
   appraisal was indirectly estimated using the Osgood's semantic
   differential. Five-point Likert scales were used to measure attitude.
   The structural equation modelling (SEM) approach was used to investigate
   the effects of psychological factors on mode choice behaviour. SEM
   captures the latent nature of psychological factors and uses path
   diagrams to identify the directionality as well as intensity of the
   relationships. The investigation reveals that passengers have positive
   emotions towards their chosen mode. Further, evidence of the superiority
   of the car as a travel alternative was established in terms of strong
   habit towards it, such that passengers would use the car for almost
   every single trip.}},

Abstract = {{The design of a 4x blind analogue-to-digital converter (ADC)-based

   implements a speculative decision-feedback equaliser. By reducing the
   ADC resolution and by simplifying the digital clock and data recovery
   design, the power consumption is reduced by a factor of 2 compared with
   previous works. Measurement results confirm a bit error rate of <10(-12)
   at 5 Gbit/s with a high-frequency jitter tolerance of 0.39 and 0.31 UIpp
   for a 9.3 and a 12.9 dB FR4 channel, respectively. The entire receiver
   consumes 63 and 86 mW for the respective channels.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow individuals to use only cognitive
   activities to interact with their environment. The widespread use of
   BCIs is limited, due in part to their lack of user-friendliness. The
   main goal of this work was to develop a more user-centered BCI and
   determine if: (1) individuals can acquire control of an online
   near-infrared spectroscopy BCI via usability and performance-informed
   selection of mental tasks without compromising classification accuracy
   and (2) the combination of usability and performance-informed selection
   of mental tasks yields subjective ease-of-use ratings that exceed those
   attainable with prescribed mental tasks. Twenty able-bodied participants
   were recruited. Half of the participants served as a control group,
   using the state-of-the-art prescribed mental strategies. The other half
   of the participants comprised the study group, choosing their own
   personalized mental strategies out of eleven possible tasks. It was
   concluded that users were, in fact, able to acquire control of the more
   user-centered BCI without a significant change in accuracy compared to
   the prescribed task BCI. Furthermore, the personalized BCI yielded
   higher subjective ease-of-use ratings than the prescribed BCI. Average
   online accuracies of 77 +/- 12.9\% and 73 +/- 12.9\% were achieved by
   the personalized and prescribed mental task groups, respectively. (C)

Abstract = {{Bio-based/green polymers and multifunctional bio-based polymeric
   composites warrant a multidisciplinary approach to promote the
   development of the next generation of materials, products, and processes
   that are environmentally sustainable. The scientific challenge is to
   produce bio-based composites with suitable properties as replacements
   for current oil-based materials in different applications to create the
   demand for mass production of bio-based/green polymers. This would raise
   sustainable development of these eco-friendly materials. This research
   aims to develop a new family of multifunctional bio-based polymer
   composites with improved thermal conductivity to be used for heat
   management in the electronics industry. A series of parametric studies
   were conducted to clarify the science behind the composites' behavior
   and their structure-to-property relationships. Using bio-based polymers
   (e.g., polylactic acid (PLA)) as the matrix, heat transfer networks were
   developed and structured by embedding hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) in a
   PLA matrix. The effects of random uniform micron size thermal networks
   of hBN on improving the effective thermal conductivity (k(eff)) of
   produced composites were studied and compared. The composites were then
   characterized with respect to physical, thermal, electrical, and
   mechanical properties for practical usage in the electronics industry.
   The use of high thermally conductive filler systems, with optimized
   material formulation, was found to promote the composites' effective
   thermal conductivity more than 11-fold over neat PLA. The thermally
   conductive composite is expected to afford unique opportunities to
   injection mold three-dimensional, net-shaped, lightweight, and
   eco-friendly microelectronic enclosures with superior heat dissipation
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{We investigate the effect of a thin PbS quantum dot (QD) layer on the
   performance of hybrid quantum-dot-organic solar cells (QD-OSCs). The PbS
   QD layer is able to function as a photosensitizing layer to improve
   short circuit current density (J(sc)) and power conversion efficiency
   (PCE) by exploiting solar flux in the near infrared region up to 1100
   nm. The increase in J(sc) is well represented by changes observed in the
   external quantum efficiency of devices with and without the PbS QD
   layer, including the region of the first exciton transition where only
   the PbS QD layer absorbs. Remarkably, enhanced performance was observed
   in QD-OSCs consisting of just a 13 nm thick PbS QD layer and 150 nm
   PTB7:PC71BM layer, exhibiting a J(sc) of 17.0 mA cm(-2), and PCE of
   8.30\% (8.58\% for champion device) compared to reference devices
   without PbS QD which produced a J(sc) of 15.4 mA cm(-2) and PCE of
   7.56\%. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Measuring the excitability of individual axons is complicated by the
   prohibitive difficulty in obtaining intracellular recordings. Here, we
   present an innovative methodology that enables local excitability to be
   measured anywhere in a channelrhodopsin (ChR2)-expressing neuron. The
   approach hinges on activating ChR2 in a spatially and temporally precise
   manner while recording the resulting spike train from a remote site. We
   validated this approach in primary afferent neurons (PANs). Initial
   encoding of somatosensory stimuli relies on transduction of the physical
   stimulus into a receptor potential and transformation of the receptor
   potential into a spike train; the transformation process depends on the
   excitability of the most distal PAN endings but, as explained above, is
   extraordinarily difficult to study in situ using traditional methods.
   Using ChR2-based photoactivation, we show 1) that excitability differs
   between the distal endings and more proximal portions of PAN axons, 2)
   that the transformation process differs between PANs, and 3) that the
   transformation process is directly affected by inflammation. Beyond
   presenting an innovative method by which to study axonal excitability,
   this study has validated its utility in helping to decipher the earliest
   stages of somatosensory encoding.}},

Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON RECONFIGURABLE TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Benchmarks play a key role in Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)
   architecture and CAD research, enabling the quantitative comparison of
   tools and architectures. It is important that these benchmarks reflect
   modern large-scale systems that make use of heterogeneous resources;
   however, most current FPGA benchmarks are both small and simple. In this
   artile, we present Titan, a hybrid CAD flow that addresses these issues.
   The flow uses Altera's Quartus II FPGA CAD software to perform HDL
   synthesis and a conversion tool to translate the result into the
   academic Berkeley Logic Interchange Format (BLIF). Using this flow, we
   created the Titan23 benchmark set, which consists of 23 large (90K-1.8M
   block) benchmark circuits covering a wide range of application domains.
   Using the Titan23 benchmarks and an enhanced model of Altera's Stratix
   IV architecture, including a detailed timing model, we compare the
   performance and quality of VPR and Quartus II targeting the same
   architecture. We found that VPR is at least 2.8xslower, uses 6.2x more
   memory, 2.2x more wire, and produces critical paths 1.5x slower compared
   to Quartus II. Finally, we identified that VPR's focus on achieving a
   dense packing and an inability to take apart clusters is responsible for
   a large portion of the wire length and critical path delay gap.}},

Title = {{A PEGylation-Free Biomimetic Porphyrin Nanoplatform for Personalized

Volume = {{9}},

Abstract = {{PEGylation (PEG) is the most commonly adopted strategy to prolong
   nanoparticles' vascular circulation by mitigating the
   reticuloendothelial system uptake. However, there remain many concerns
   in regards to its immunogenicity, targeting efficiency, etc., which
   inspires pursuit of alternate, non-PEGylated systems. We introduced here
   a PEG-free, porphyrin-based ultrasmall nanostructure mimicking nature
   lipoproteins, termed PLP, that integrates multiple imaging and
   therapeutic functionalities, including positron emission tomography
   (PET) imaging, near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence imaging and photodynamic
   therapy (PDT). With an engineered lipoprotein-mimicking structure, PLP
   is highly stable in the blood circulation, resulting in favorable
   pharmacokinetics and biodistribution without the need of PEG. The prompt
   tumor intracellular trafficking of PLP allows for rapid nanostructure
   dissociation upon tumor accumulation to release monomeric porphyrins to
   efficiently generate fluorescence and photodynamic reactivity, which are
   highly silenced in intact PLP, thus providing an activatable mechanism
   for low-background NIR fluorescence imaging and tumor-selective PDT. Its
   intrinsic copper-64 labeling feature allows for noninvasive PET imaging
   of PLP delivery and quantitative assessment of drug distribution. Using
   a clinically relevant glioblastoma multiforme model, we demonstrated
   that PLP enabled accurate delineation of tumor from surrounding healthy
   brain at size less than 1 mm, exhibiting the potential for
   intraoperative fluorescence-guided surgery and tumor-selective PDT.
   Furthermore, we demonstrated the general applicability of PLP for
   sensitive and accurate detection of primary and metastatic tumors in
   other clinically relevant animal models. Therefore, PLP offers a
   biomimetic theranostic nanoplatform for pretreatment stratification
   using PET and NIR fluorescence imaging and for further customized cancer
   management via imaging-guided surgery, PDT, or/and potential
   chemotherapy.}},

Abstract = {{Delivering milliwatts of wireless power at centimeter distances is
   advantageous to many existing and emerging biomedical applications. It
   is highly desirable to fully integrate the receiver on a single chip in

   transfer (WPT) receiver (Rx) coil fabricated in 0.13 mu m CMOS. The WPT
   system utilizes a 14.5 x 14.5 mm(2) transmitter (Tx) coil that is
   fabricated on a standard FR4 substrate. The on-chip power harvester
   demonstrates a peak WPT efficiency of -18.47dB, -20.96 dB and -20.15 dB,
   at 10 mm of separation through air, bovine muscle and 0.2 molar NaCl,
   respectively. The achieved efficiency enables the delivery of milliwatts

Abstract = {{Study design: Consensus statement.
   Introduction: There is a lack of consensus in the literature on the
   measures of pediatric upper extremity (UE) function for musculoskeletal
   conditions.
   Purpose: To establish expert consensus on utility, satisfaction and
   importance of functional outcome measures in children with UE
   musculoskeletal conditions, across International Classification of
   Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) domains.
   Methods: Using Delphi Consensus Methodology, expert panelists completed
   three rounds of questionnaires.
   Results: Agreement on Body Functions and Structure, Activity, and
   Participation outcome measures was determined (alpha, ICC range =
   0.86-0.96). Mean satisfaction of measures in the respective domains was
   between 6.93 and 7.94. The Activity domain had lowest satisfaction,
   however there was consensus it was the most important.
   Discussion: Consensus on relative importance, but low satisfaction in
   the Activity domain suggests a need for better outcomes in this domain.
   Conclusions: Findings report the status of outcome measure utility and
   use in pediatric UE function. (C) 2015 Hanley \& Belfus, an imprint of

Title = {{All-photonic quantum repeaters}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Quantum communication holds promise for unconditionally secure
   transmission of secret messages and faithful transfer of unknown quantum
   states. Photons appear to be the medium of choice for quantum
   communication. Owing to photon losses, robust quantum communication over
   long lossy channels requires quantum repeaters. It is widely believed
   that a necessary and highly demanding requirement for quantum repeaters
   is the existence of matter quantum memories. Here we show that such a
   requirement is, in fact, unnecessary by introducing the concept of
   all-photonic quantum repeaters based on flying qubits. In particular, we
   present a protocol based on photonic cluster-state machine guns and a
   loss-tolerant measurement equipped with local high-speed active
   feedforwards. We show that, with such all-photonic quantum repeaters,
   the communication efficiency scales polynomially with the channel
   distance. Our result paves a new route towards quantum repeaters with
   efficient single-photon sources rather than matter quantum memories.}},

Title = {{Programmable definition of nanogap electronic devices using
   self-inhibited reagent depletion}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Electrodes exhibiting controlled nanoscale separations are required in
   devices for light detection, semiconductor electronics and medical
   diagnostics. Here we use low-cost lithography to define micron-separated
   electrodes, which we downscale to create three-dimensional electrodes
   separated by nanoscale gaps. Only by devising a new strategy, which we
   term electrochemical self-inhibited reagent depletion, were we able to
   produce a robust self-limiting nanogap manufacturing technology. We
   investigate the method using experiment and simulation and find that,
   when electrodeposition is carried out using micron-spaced electrodes
   simultaneously poised at the same potential, these exhibit
   self-inhibited reagent depletion, leading to defined and robust
   nanogaps. Particularly remarkable is the formation of fractal electrodes
   that exhibit interpenetrating jagged elements that consistently avoid
   electrical contact. We showcase the new technology by fabricating
   photodetectors with responsivities (A/W) that are one hundred times
   higher than previously reported photodetectors operating at the same low
   (1-3 V) voltages. The new strategy adds to the nanofabrication toolkit
   method that unites top-down template definition with bottom-up
   three-dimensional nanoscale features.}},

   loudspeakers, which are typically used for prototyping such devices,
   hard drive actuators are cheap and ubiquitous, but they are less

   Frequencies between 0 and 17 kHz, and likely beyond, can be reproduced
   reliably. No machining tools or amplifying electronics are needed for

Abstract = {{Based on the powerful Computational Structural Dynamics method coupled
   to a Computational Fluid Dynamics approach, the PolyMAX algorithm is
   used along with the simulation of two-way fluid-structure interactions,
   as a new virtual testing method for estimating the structural modal
   parameters and damping ratios of a vibrating structure in either air or
   some other fluid. The viscosity and motion of fluid are accounted for,
   as are the shape of the flow passage and a variety of boundary
   conditions. The method is shown to be able to simulate the vibration of
   a structure within a real operating environment in which the structure
   experiences a specified excitation load while the vibration responses of
   the structure are obtained through a two-way FSI model. Based on the
   PolyMAX method for estimating the modal parameters, these vibration
   responses are processed and analyzed. Finally, the dynamic parameters
   (i.e., the natural frequencies and the damping ratios) of the vibrating
   structure are identified. For validation, the natural frequencies and
   damping ratios of two simple submerged cantilever plates were simulated
   both in air and water and the simulated results were found to agree
   closely with experimental data. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Volume = {{7}},

Abstract = {{Wavelength routing based on arrayed waveguide grating (AWG) devices has
   been proposed as a disruptive technology for capacity, footprint, and
   flexibility requirements of cloud data centers. The limited buffering
   capacity of AWG-based routers, however, affects network throughput and
   makes them highly susceptible to data center traffic imbalance. A
   load-balancing stage, capable of evenly distributing the incoming
   traffic in both space and time, can improve network robustness and
   remedy congestion penalties. Robustness and scalability due to load
   balancing come at the cost of physical-layer complexities in terms of
   added cost, power consumption, and impairments. In this paper, we
   conduct a novel scalable analysis to study load-balancing tradeoffs
   between network-layer gains and physical-layer penalties in a multistage
   routing scenario. Our cross-layer simulations examine the requirements
   of a wavelength-routing load balancer based on AWG and tunable
   wavelength converters (TWCs) in order to achieve performance interesting
   for a data center. Our results point to the critical contribution of
   Q-factor degradation to load-balancer performance and encourage efforts
   in the design of novel router architectures, aiming to consolidate
   routing with scheduling-based load balancing.}},

Abstract = {{Glioblastoma, the most common and aggressive type of brain tumors, has
   devastatingly proliferative and invasive characteristics. The need for
   finding a novel and specific drug target is urgent as the current
   approaches have limited therapeutic effects in treating glioblastoma.
   Xyloketal B is a marine compound obtained from mangrove fungus Xylaria
   sp. (No. 2508) from the South China Sea, and has displayed antioxidant
   activity and protective effects on endothelial and neuronal oxidative
   injuries. In this study, we used a glioblastoma U251 cell line to (1)
   explore the effects of xyloketal B on cell viability, proliferation, and
   migration; and (2) investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms and
   signaling pathways. MTT assay, colony formation, wound healing, western
   blot, and patch clamp techniques were employed. We found that xyloketal
   B reduced cell viability, proliferation, and migration of U251 cells. In
   addition, xyloketal B decreased p-Akt and p-ERK1/2 protein expressions.
   Furthermore, xyloketal B blocked TRPM7 currents in HEK-293 cells
   overexpressing TRPM7. These effects were confirmed by using a TRPM7
   inhibitor, carvacrol, in a parallel experiment. Our findings indicate
   that TRPM7-regulated PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK signaling is involved in
   anti-proliferation and migration effects of xyloketal B on U251 cells,
   providing in vitro evidence for the marine compound xyloketal B to be a
   potential drug for treating glioblastoma.}},

Abstract = {{Diagnosis of disease outside of sophisticated laboratories urgently
   requires low-cost, user-friendly devices. Disposable, instrument-free
   testing devices are used for home and physician office testing, but are
   limited in applicability to a small class of highly abundant analytes.
   Direct, unambiguous visual read-out is an ideal way to deliver a result
   on a disposable device; however, existing strategies that deliver
   appropriate sensitivity produce only subtle colour changes. Here we
   report a new approach, which we term electrocatalytic fluid
   displacement, where a molecular binding event is transduced into an
   electrochemical current, which drives the electrodeposition of a metal
   catalyst. The catalyst promotes bubble formation that displaces a fluid
   to reveal a high contrast change. We couple the read-out system to a
   nanostructured microelectrode and demonstrate direct visual detection of
   100 fM DNA in 10 min. This represents the lowest limit of detection of
   nucleic acids reported using high contrast visual read-out.}},

Abstract = {{The grafting reactivities with glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) of five
   xylans from hardwood and cereal sources were compared. The structural
   property that best predicted the reactivities of xylans with GMA was the
   fraction of 4-O-methylglucuronic acid (MeGlcA) substitution. A
   comparatively high level of arabinose substitution was also positively
   correlated to reactivity with GMA. The impact of MeGlcA and arabinose
   branching groups is likely attributed to the solubilizing effect of
   these substituents. Consistent with this prediction, low water
   solubility and high lignin content were found to hinder reactivity. Even
   though oligomeric substrates have the advantage of water solubility,
   modified xylo-oligosaccharides were difficult to purify. Accordingly,
   delignified and high-molecular weight xylans that are soluble or
   dispersible in water are best suited for this type of backbone
   derivatization. Adsorption studies with a quartz crystal microbalance
   with dissipation indicated that grafting lowered the total adsorption of
   arabinoxylan but did not significantly affect the fraction of xylans
   adsorbed irreversibly on cellulose.}},

   hypothesised that the effects of thermal diffusion caused by the steep
   temperature gradient (similar to 1550 degrees) between the incoming gas
   stream and the surface of the droplet, is responsible for the difference
   observed between the well established mass transfer model and the
   experimental data for decarburisation kinetics. This finding has
   important implications with respect to the application of appropriate

Abstract = {{Temperature and relative humidity (hygrothermal) cycles during PEM fuel
   cell operation can lead to the introduction and exacerbation of
   micro-scale mechanical defects. We developed a two-dimensional finite
   element model based on cohesive zone theory to describe the delamination
   propagation at the cathodic membrane/catalyst layer interface due to
   temperature and hygrothermal duty cycles. Particularly, the effects of
   hygrothermal cycle amplitudes, relative humidity (RH) distribution
   profiles, and gas flow channel position were studied. It was found that
   doubling the hygrothermal cycle amplitude resulted in a 6-fold increase
   in fatigue stresses, and a defect length growth to 0,1 mm before
   reaching the end of the fuel cell life (40,000 cycles). A counter
   intuitive result was also observed, whereby a crack located within the
   membrane was found to grow faster than a delamination located at the
   catalyst layer/membrane interface. When introducing an anode/cathode
   channel offset, a 2-fold increase in the rate of delamination
   propagation was found compared to the case with the aligned anode and

Abstract = {{This forum article explores thermodynamic understanding of the growth of
   cities, including theoretical foundations, observations, and analysis.
   The general theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics is reviewed,
   recognizing differences in interpretation between Prigogine and
   Schneider and Kay as well as discussing the hypothesis of maximum
   entropy production. Calculations of exergy gradients in a few cities and
   settlements, along with measures of anthropogenic heat loss in further
   cities, support the notion that cities are dissipative structures. The
   observation that primary energy use per capita increases in Singapore
   and Hong Kong as they grow is further evidence to support the
   thermodynamic understanding of the growth of cities, indicative of an
   increasing rate of entropy production. At the global scale, the strong
   linear relationship between global urban population and total global
   energy use, and the distribution of city sizes according to Zipf's law,
   can be understood as emergent results based on thermodynamics. Parallel
   results might be derived from models that represent underlying
   microscale processes, several of which are reviewed. Issues for future
   research include: development of nonequilibrium thermodynamic models
   specific to city growth; further study of exergy flows of cities with
   consistent methodology, including attention to solar energy exchanges in
   cities; and further exploration of links between thermodynamic and
   economic models of urban growth.}},

Abstract = {{Converting nanoparticles or monomeric compounds into larger
   supramolecular structures by endogenous(1,2) or external(3,4) stimuli is
   increasingly popular because these materials are useful for imaging and
   treating diseases. However, conversion of microstructures to
   nanostructures is less common. Here, we show the conversion of
   microbubbles to nanoparticles using low-frequency ultrasound. The
   microbubble consists of a bacteriochlorophyll-lipid shell around a
   perfluoropropane gas. The encapsulated gas provides ultrasound imaging
   contrast and the porphyrins in the shell confer photoacoustic and
   fluorescent properties. On exposure to ultrasound, the microbubbles
   burst and form smaller nanoparticles that possess the same optical
   properties as the original microbubble. We show that this conversion is
   possible in tumour-bearing mice and could be validated using
   photoacoustic imaging. With this conversion, our microbubble can
   potentially be used to bypass the enhanced permeability and retention
   effect when delivering drugs to tumours.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a partially observable degrading system subject to condition
   monitoring and random failure. The system's condition is categorized
   into one of three states: a healthy state, a warning state, and a
   failure state. Only the failure state is observable. While the system is
   operational, vector data that is stochastically related to the system
   state is obtained through condition monitoring at regular sampling
   epochs. The state process evolution follows a hidden semi-Markov model
   (HSMM) and Erlang distribution is used for modeling the system's sojourn
   time in each of its operational states. The Expectation-maximization
   (EM) algorithm is applied to estimate the state and observation
   parameters of the HSMM. Explicit formulas for several important
   quantities for the system residual life estimation such as the
   conditional reliability function and the mean residual life are derived
   in terms of the posterior probability that the system is in the warning
   state. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the applicability
   of the estimation procedure and failure prediction method. A comparison
   results with hidden Markov modeling are provided to illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed model. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Journal = {{PHYTOCHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{112}},

Abstract = {{The secondary walls of angiosperms contain large amounts of
   glucuronoxylan that is thought to be covalently linked to lignin via
   ester bonds between 4-O-methyl-alpha-D-glucuronic acid (4-O-Me-GlcA)
   moieties in glucuronoxylan and alcohol groups in lignin. This linkage is
   proposed to be hydrolysed by glucuronoyl esterases (GCEs) secreted by
   wood-degrading fungi. We report effects of overexpression of a GCE from
   the white-rot basidiomycete Phanerochaete carnosa, PcGCE, in hybrid
   aspen (Populus tremula L. x tremuloides Michx.) on the wood composition
   and the saccharification efficiency.
   The recombinant enzyme, which was targeted to the plant cell wall using
   the signal peptide from hybrid aspen cellulase PttCel9B3, was
   constitutively expressed resulting in the appearance of GCE activity in
   protein extracts from developing wood.
   Diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectroscopy and pyrolysis-GC/MS analyses
   showed significant alternation in wood chemistry of transgenic plants
   including an increase in lignin content and S/G ratio, and a decrease in
   carbohydrate content Sequential wood extractions confirmed a massive
   (+43\%) increase of Klason lignin, which was accompanied by a ca. 5\%
   decrease in cellulose, and ca. 20\% decrease in wood extractives.
   Analysis of the monosaccharide composition using methanolysis showed a
   reduction of 4-O-Me-GlcA content without a change in Xyl contents in
   transgenic lines, suggesting that the covalent links between 4-O-Me-GlcA
   moieties and lignin protect these moieties from degradation. Enzymatic
   saccharification without pretreatment resulted in significant decreases
   of the yields of Gal, Glc, Xyl and Man in transgenic lines, consistent
   with their increased recalcitrance caused by the increased lignin
   content In contrast, the enzymatic saccharification after acid
   pretreatment resulted in Glc yields similar to wild-type despite of
   their lower cellulose content.
   These data indicate that whereas PcGCE expression in hybrid aspen
   increases lignin deposition, the inhibitory effects of lignin are
   efficiently removed during acid pretreatment, and the extent of wood
   cellulose conversion during hydrolysis after acid pretreatment is
   improved in the transgenic lines possible due to reduced cell wall
   cross-links between cell wall biopolymers by PcGCE. (C) 2014 The

Abstract = {{The optical properties of frozen waves (FWs) are theoretically and
   numerically investigated using the generalized Lorenz-Mie theory (GLMT)
   together with integral localized approximation. These waves are
   constructed from a suitable superposition of equal-frequency ordinary
   Bessel beams and are capable of providing almost any desired
   longitudinal intensity profile along their optical axis, thus being of
   potential interest in applications in which intensity localization may
   be used advantageously, such as in optical trapping and
   micromanipulation systems. In addition, because FWs are composed of
   nondiffracting beams, they are also capable of overcoming the
   diffraction effects for longer distances when compared to conventional
   (ordinary) beams, e.g., Gaussian beams. Expressions for the beam-shape
   coefficients of FWs are provided, and the GLMT is used to reconstruct
   their intensity profiles and to predict their optical properties for
   possible biomedical optics purposes. (C) 2015 Optical Society of America}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a boundary controller for a flexible marine riser to
   suppress the riser's vibration with a top tension constraint. The
   flexible marine riser is described by a distributed parameter system
   with a partial differential equation and four ordinary differential

   the riser based on an integral-barrier Lyapunov function to suppress the
   riser's tension at top. Adaptive control is designed when the system
   parametric uncertainty exists. With the proposed robust adaptive
   boundary control, uniformed boundedness under the ocean disturbance can
   be achieved. Stability analysis of the closed-loop system is given using
   the Lyapunov stability theory. Simulation results illustrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed boundary controller with top tension

Abstract = {{Equilibrium contact angle of liquid drops over horizontal surfaces has
   been modeled using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). The model is
   capable of accurate implementation of contact angles to stationary and
   moving contact lines. In this scheme, the desired value for stationary
   or dynamic contact angle is used to correct the profile near the triple
   point. This is achieved by correcting the surface normals near the
   contact line and also interpolating the drop profile into the
   boundaries. Simulations show that a close match to the chosen contact
   angle values can be achieved for both stationary and moving contact
   lines. This technique has proven to reduce the amount of nonphysical
   shear stresses near the triple point and to enhance the convergence
   characteristics of the solver.}},

Title = {{Models for predicting objective function weights in prostate cancer IMRT}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{42}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{1586-1595}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and evaluate the clinical applicability of advanced
   machine learning models that simultaneously predict multiple
   optimization objective function weights from patient geometry for
   intensity-modulated radiation therapy of prostate cancer.
   Methods: A previously developed inverse optimization method was applied
   retrospectively to determine optimal objective function weights for 315
   treated patients. The authors used an overlap volume ratio (OV) of
   bladder and rectum for different PTV expansions and overlap volume
   histogram slopes (OVSR and OVSB for the rectum and bladder,
   respectively) as explanatory variables that quantify patient geometry.
   Using the optimal weights as ground truth, the authors trained and
   applied three prediction models: logistic regression (LR), multinomial
   logistic regression (MLR), and weighted K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The
   population average of the optimal objective function weights was also
   calculated.
   Results: The OV at 0.4 cm and OVSR at 0.1 cm features were found to be
   the most predictive of the weights. The authors observed comparable
   performance (i.e., no statistically significant difference) between LR,
   MLR, and KNN methodologies, with LR appearing to perform the best. All
   three machine learning models outperformed the population average by a
   statistically significant amount over a range of clinical metrics
   including bladder/rectum V53Gy, bladder/rectum V70Gy, and dose to the
   bladder, rectum, CTV, and PTV. When comparing the weights directly, the
   LR model predicted bladder and rectum weights that had, on average, a
   73\% and 74\% relative improvement over the population average weights,
   respectively. The treatment plans resulting from the LR weights had, on
   average, a rectum V70Gy that was 35\% closer to the clinical plan and a
   bladder V70Gy that was 29\% closer, compared to the population average
   weights. Similar results were observed for all other clinical metrics.
   Conclusions: The authors demonstrated that the KNN and MLR weight
   prediction methodologies perform comparably to the LR model and can
   produce clinical quality treatment plans by simultaneously predicting
   multiple weights that capture trade-offs associated with sparing
   multiple OARs. (C) 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.}},

Abstract = {{As the first section of a multi-part review series, this section
   provides an overview of the ongoing research and development aimed at
   fabricating novel heart valve replacements beyond what is currently
   available for patients. Here we discuss heart valve replacement options
   that involve a biological component or process for creation, either in
   vitro or in vivo (tissue-engineered heart valves), and heart valves that
   are fabricated from polymeric material that are considered permanent
   inert materials that may suffice for adults where growth is not
   required. Polymeric materials provide opportunities for cost-effective
   heart valves that can be more easily manufactured and can be easily
   integrated with artificial heart and ventricular assist device
   technologies. Tissue engineered heart valves show promise as a
   regenerative patient specific model that could be the future of all
   valve replacement. Because tissue-engineered heart valves depend on
   cells for their creation, understanding how cells sense and respond to
   chemical and physical stimuli in their microenvironment is critical and
   therefore, is also reviewed.}},

   valve engineering) is an exciting and evolving field. Since the first
   valve replacement, technology has progressed by leaps and bounds.
   Innovations emerge frequently and supply patients and physicians with

   much as any other field in medicine the treatment of heart valve disease
   has experienced a renaissance in the last 10 years. Here we review the
   currently available technologies and future options in the surgical and

Abstract = {{On-chip jitter measurement can be used to optimize the performance of
   wireline transceivers. In this work, the jitter of random data is
   measured on-chip by correlating the phase detector outputs from two
   adjacent CDR lanes. This allows the jitter's auto-correlation function
   to be estimated, from which the jitter's RMS value and power spectral
   density are extracted without using any external reference clock. The
   RMS value of random jitter ranging from 0.85 ps to 1.89 ps, and
   sinusoidal jitter from 0.89 ps to 5.1 ps is measured in PRBS31 data with
   less than 0.6 ps of error compared to measurements by an 80 GS/s
   real-time oscilloscope. Correlating the phase detectors in the CDRs with
   a third phase detector, which measures the phase difference between the
   clocks recovered by the two CDRs, allows measurement of the recovered
   clock jitter. Sinusoidal jitter from 1.8 ps to 5.3 ps is measured in the
   recovered clock with an error of less than 1 ps.}},

Abstract = {{Automated tracking of living cells in microscopy image sequences is an
   important and challenging problem. With this application in mind, we
   propose a global track linking algorithm, which links cell outlines
   generated by a segmentation algorithm into tracks. The algorithm adds
   tracks to the image sequence one at a time, in a way which uses
   information from the complete image sequence in every linking decision.
   This is achieved by finding the tracks which give the largest possible
   increases to a probabilistically motivated scoring function, using the
   Viterbi algorithm. We also present a novel way to alter previously
   created tracks when new tracks are created, thus mitigating the effects
   of error propagation. The algorithm can handle mitosis, apoptosis, and
   migration in and out of the imaged area, and can also deal with false
   positives, missed detections, and clusters of jointly segmented cells.
   The algorithm performance is demonstrated on two challenging datasets
   acquired using bright-field microscopy, but in principle, the algorithm
   can be used with any cell type and any imaging technique, presuming
   there is a suitable segmentation algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, Bonded-Discrete element methods (Bonded-DEM) and hybrid
   finite-discrete element methods (FDEM) have become widely employed to
   model brittle fracturing processing in geomaterials. These approaches
   possess the ability to explicitly simulate fracture and fragmentation,
   but necessitate a large number of input parameters to be specified. Many
   of these parameters cannot be directly measured or characterized via
   laboratory tests and therefore must be estimated via calibration
   procedures to attain reliable results. In this work, a prescriptive
   procedure to arrive at a combination of input parameters for the newly
   developed Y-Geo FDEM code is developed. The proposed procedure is
   applicable for laboratory-scale simulations where some laboratory
   testing data for the material to be simulated is available. It uses a
   combination of the known elastic parameters, uniaxial compressive
   strength, and Brazilian disc strength of a material as calibration
   targets and limits the over-determined nature of the calibration problem
   by considering the similitude of the resulting fracture patterns. The
   development of this procedure represents a major step forward in
   obtaining reliable and consistent results using an FDEM approach. (C)

Abstract = {{Current treatments for postmenopausal osteoporosis aim to either promote
   bone formation or inhibit bone resorption. The C1 conjugate drug
   represents a new treatment approach by chemically linking the
   antiresorptive compound alendronate (ALN) with the anabolic agent
   prostanoid EP4 receptor agonist (EP4a) through a linker molecule (LK) to
   form a conjugate compound. This enables the bone-targeting ability of
   ALN to deliver EP4a to bone sites and mitigate the systemic side effects
   of EP4a, while also facilitating dual antiresorptive and anabolic
   effects. In vivo hydrolysis is required to release the EP4a and ALN
   components for pharmacological activity. Our study investigated the in
   vivo efficacy of this drug in treating established bone loss using an
   ovariectomized (OVX) rat model of postmenopausal osteopenia. In a
   curative experiment, 3-month-old female Sprague-Dawley rats were OVX,
   allowed to lose bone for 7 weeks, then treated for 6 weeks. Treatment
   groups consisted of C1 conjugate at low and high doses, vehicle-treated
   OVX and sham, prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), and mixture of unconjugated
   ALN-LK and EP4a to assess the effect of conjugation. Results showed that
   weekly administration of C1 conjugate dose-dependently increased bone
   volume in trabecular bone, which partially or completely reversed
   OVX-induced bone loss in the lumbar vertebra and improved vertebral
   mechanical strength. The conjugate also dose-dependently stimulated
   endocortical woven bone formation and intracortical resorption in
   cortical bone, with high-dose treatment increasing the mechanical
   strength but compromising the material properties. Conjugation between
   the EP4a and ALN-LK components was crucial to the drug's anabolic
   efficacy. To our knowledge, the C1 conjugate represents the first time
   that a combined therapy using an anabolic agent and the antiresorptive
   compound ALN has shown significant anabolic effects which reversed
   established osteopenia. (c) 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral

Abstract = {{Purpose: To determine the pressure required to prime an Ahmed Glaucoma
   Valve (AGV) and determine whether the valve can be damaged by
   ``over-priming pressure.{''}
   Methods: Three AGVs, a syringe pump, and a manometer were used to assess
   priming pressure. Balanced salt solution was pumped through the AGV tube
   at increasing pressures until a jet of fluid was seen to eject from the
   AGV, as per manufacturer instructions. This was repeated 3 times for 3
   different virgin AGVs giving the ``priming pressure.{''} A second
   experiment used the same experimental set up to determine the
   ``over-priming pressure{''} on 3 other AGVs. Fluid was pumped through
   the AGV at increasing pressures until evidence of damage was seen. The
   valve function was assessed before and after the ``over-priming{''}
   stress test. Valve function was determined by the closing pressure,
   which is the pressure at which the valve closes and fluid was no longer
   seen passing through the valve.
   Results: The priming pressure in the 3 AGVs was 2844, 3154, and 3051 mm
   Hg (mean, 3017 +/- 158 mm Hg). The maximum pressure generated using the
   syringe pump was 10,860, 10,343, and 10,860 mm Hg (mean, 10,688 +/- 299
   mm Hg). No damage was observed in the valve mechanism. AGV closing
   pressure before the ``over-priming{''} stress test was 8, 6, and 13 mm
   Hg and after the stress test was 6, 7, and 13 mm Hg.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the priming pressure is
   consistent at around 3000 mm Hg. In addition, over-priming is not likely
   to damage or disturb the closing pressure.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesFunctional electrical stimulation (FES) has been shown to
   facilitate the recovery of grasping function in individuals with
   incomplete spinal cord injury. Neurophysiological theory suggests that
   this benefit may be further enhanced by a more consistent pairing of the
   voluntary commands sent from the user's brain down their spinal cord
   with the electrical stimuli applied to the user's periphery. The
   objective of the study was to compare brain-machine interfaces
   (BMIs)-controlled and electromyogram (EMG)-controlled FES therapy to
   three more well-researched therapies, namely, push button-controlled FES
   therapy, voluntary grasping (VOL), and BMI-guided voluntary grasping.
   Materials and MethodsTen able-bodied participants underwent one hour of
   each of five grasping training modalities, including BMI-controlled FES
   (BMI-FES), EMG-controlled FES (EMG-FES), conventional push
   button-controlled FES, VOL, and BMI-guided voluntary grasping.
   Assessments, including motor-evoked potential, grip force, and maximum
   voluntary contraction, were conducted immediately before and after each
   training period.
   ResultsMotor-evoked potential-based outcome measures were more
   upregulated following BMI-FES and especially EMG-FES than they were
   following VOL or FES. No significant changes were found in the more
   functional outcome measures.
   ConclusionsThese results provide preliminary evidence suggesting the
   potential of BMI-FES and EMG-FES to induce greater neuroplastic changes
   than conventional therapies, although the precise mechanism behind these
   changes remains speculative. Further investigation will be required to
   elucidate the underlying mechanisms and to conclusively determine
   whether these effects can translate into better long-term functional
   outcomes and quality of life for individuals with spinal cord injury.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, passivity-based methods are used to perform tracking
   control of flexible robot manipulators subject to impact collision. The
   model taken for colliding system is an n-degree of freedom body moving
   in the manipulator's workspace. Impulsive forces generated in the course
   of impact cause sudden changes in velocity/acceleration of the links of
   robot and the colliding system. On the other hand, under-actuated
   systems subject to impact are likely to have instabilities, or poor
   transient responses, due to excitation of some un-actuated states. The
   proposed adaptive passivity-based controller not only improves the
   post-impact transient response of the under-actuated system (e.g.
   flexible-joint robot), but also needs no force sensor to measure impulse
   force during the impact phase of robot motion. The main advantage of the
   proposed controller relative to model-based inverse-dynamic algorithms
   is its highly robust characteristics in dampening effects of oscillation
   right after impact collision for an under-actuated system. This can be
   done through the introduction of an energy-storage function which
   incorporates the effects of both actuated and un-actuated states of the
   system.}},

   response to air pollution in a mouse model of asthma. The aim of this
   study was to further investigate the role of Syk in airway contractility
   in response to methacholine (MCh) and particulate matter (PM) air
   pollutants, in the absence of underlying inflammation.
   Methods: We used Syk(flox/flox)//rosa26CreER(T2) conditional Syk
   knockout mice to evaluate respiratory mechanics and MCh responsiveness
   following PM exposure in vivo using the ventilator-based flexiVent (R)
   system.
   Results: While total and differential cell counts in bronchoalveolar
   lavage fluid were similar between the Syk(flox/flox) and Syk(del/del)
   mice, central airways respiratory resistance (RN) to MCh was
   significantly augmented following PM exposure between Syk-intact
   (Syk(flox/flox)) and Syk-deficient (Syk(del/del)) mice (R-N(max): 2.06
   +/- 0.29 vs. 1.29 +/- 0.10, respectively; p < 0.05, n = 8-10/group). We
   employed live video-microscopy to investigate changes in airway luminal
   diameter using ex vivo lung slices, which were devoid of circulating
   leukocytes. MCh reduced the airway luminal area of Syk(flox/flox) mice
   to 81.1 +/- 1.4\% of baseline, which was virtually abrogated in
   Syk(del/del) mice (luminal area = 93.2 +/- 0.5\%, n = 5/group, p <
   0.05). In response to PM exposure, Syk(flox/flox) airways contracted to
   73.8 +/- 2.7\% of baseline luminal diameter, whereas Syk(del/del)
   airways exhibited minimal contractility to PM and MCh (90.0 +/- 1.3\% of
   baseline, n = 5/group, p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: These observations suggest that Syk mediates airway
   contractility in the normal and allergic airways, independent of its
   role and function in leukocytes, and supports a paracrine role for
   airway epithelial Syk in modulating airway smooth muscle activity.}},

Abstract = {{We study forward error correction codes for low-delay, real-time
   streaming communication over packet erasure channels. Our encoder
   operates on a stream of source packets in a sequential fashion, and the
   decoder must output each packet in the source stream within a fixed
   delay. We consider a class of practical channel models with correlated
   erasures and introduce new ``streaming codes{''} for efficient error
   correction over these channels. For our analysis, we propose a
   simplified class of erasure channels that introduce both burst and
   isolated erasures within the same decoding window. We demonstrate that
   the previously proposed streaming codes can lead to significant number
   of packet losses over such channels. Our proposed constructions involve
   a layered coding approach, where a burst-erasure code is first
   constructed, and additional layers of parity-checks are concatenated to
   recover from the isolated erasure patterns. We also introduce another
   construction that requires a significantly smaller field-size and
   decoding complexity, but incurs some performance loss. Numerical
   simulations over the Gilbert-Elliott and Fritchman channel models
   indicate that by addressing patterns involving both burst and isolated
   erasures within the same window, our proposed codes achieve significant
   gains over previously proposed streaming codes.}},

Abstract = {{An n-Laterally Double Diffused Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect
   Transistor (LDMOST) with self-driven split p-top gate is studied. By
   integrating a low-voltage charge pump circuit, a constant positive
   voltage (approximate to 10 V) is self-generated in the OFF-state and
   applied to the split p-top electrode in the ON-state. This voltage
   assists the accumulation of electrons near the surface of the n-drift
   region. As a result, the specific ON-resistance R-ON,R-sp is reduced
   without an increase in effective gate charge Q(G). Moreover, the
   adaptation of the optimum variation lateral doping enables a shorter
   n-drift region length to support the same breakdown voltage. The
   simulation results indicate that for a 600 V device, the R-ON,R-sp is
   20.7 m Omega . cm(2). This is approximately five times smaller than a
   conventional double REduced SURface Field LDMOST.}},

Abstract = {{Hopf bifurcation phenomenon of a power system results in oscillatory
   dynamics which can lead to instabilities in the system. Therefore, it is
   desirable to operate the system such that a sufficient margin to Hopf
   bifurcation is ensured. This paper presents a methodology based on the
   adjustment of the setpoint values of the HVDC link controllers, to
   prevent instability or increase the stability margin of the system
   subject to Hopf bifurcation. In this paper, the first-order
   sensitivities of the Hopf stability margin to the setpoint values of the
   HVDC links are presented. These sensitivities identify the optimum
   direction to change the HVDC setpoints to steer the system away from
   instability, increase the stability margin, and improve the damping of
   oscillatory modes. The proposed method is evaluated on various system
   configurations subject to Hopf bifurcation phenomena caused by a variety
   of events, such as load and line impedance variations. Simulation
   results show that at the optimum operating point, for a variety of Hopf
   bifurcations, the stability margin and damping of the oscillatory modes
   improve.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces an enhanced equivalent model of the half-bridge

   is, startup, dc-side pole-to-pole fault, and ac-side
   three-phase-to-ground fault. The study results indicate that: 1) in

   accurately represents the MMC under various operating conditions; 2) the

   links. The GSC is designed based on a linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG)

   ac system while either minimizing the propagation of oscillatory
   dynamics from one segment to other segments (GSC1) or enabling their
   controlled transfer from a disturbed segment to other segments (GSC2).
   The study results show that in a fully-dc-segmented system: 1) GSC1 and
   GSC2 are able to stabilize the system; 2) under GSC1, each segment can
   experience major disturbances without causing adjacent segments to
   experience the disturbances with the same degree of severity; and 3)
   GSC2 enables controlled transfer of the oscillations among the segments

Abstract = {{This research investigated the behavior of a composite shear wall system
   consisting of two skins of profiled steel sheeting and an infill of
   concrete under in-plane monotonic loading. Three sets of double skin
   composite wall (DSCW) specimens with overall wall dimensions of 1626 mm
   high by 720 mm wide were tested. Steel sheet-concrete connections were
   provided by intermediate fasteners along the height and width of the
   wall to generate composite action. Two types of concrete namely
   self-consolidating concrete (SCC) and highly ductile engineered
   cementitious composite (ECC) as well as cold formed profiled steel sheet
   having same geometry but with two different yield strengths were
   incorporated to investigate their influence on the composite wall
   behavior. Analytical models for the shear resistance of the composite
   wall were developed based on existing models taking into account the
   shear capacity of steel sheet, concrete core and steel sheet-concrete
   interaction. The advantage of using ECC over SCC was exhibited through
   more ductile wall behavior and energy absorbing capacity. The benefit of
   using mild over high strength steel was also demonstrated through more
   ductile failure. The steel-concrete intermediate fasteners along the
   height and width of the wall provided sufficient steel-concrete
   composite action to prevent early elastic buckling of the profiled steel
   sheets. Experimental and analytical shear resistance of composite walls
   showed very good agreement. The proposed analytical models can be used
   for the prediction of shear resistance of composite walls with
   reasonable accuracy. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   boron concentration. Solvent refining at lower temperatures resulted in
   smaller distribution coefficient values. The boron removal percentages

Title = {{Epidermolysis Bullosa Pruriginosa: A Systematic Review Exploring
   Genotype-Phenotype Correlation}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL DERMATOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{81-87}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Introduction Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) is a clinical
   variant of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), characterized by
   intense pruritus and hypertrophic, lichenified, prurigo-like papules,
   plaques, and nodules secondary to scratching. These clinical findings
   have been attributed to various mutations in the COL7A1 gene. Previous
   reports have yielded inconsistent findings regarding a possible
   genotype-phenotype relationship in EBP.
   Objective Our aim was to conduct a systematic review aimed at assessing
   the genotype-phenotype correlation in EBP.
   Methods A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Medline, EMBASE,
   and Cochrane databases for all reports of mutation-verified EBP,
   published from 1946 to September 2014. Statistical comparison of
   clinical findings between mutation types was performed using logistic
   regression analysis.
   Results The review included a total of 28 articles with 74 individuals,
   which consisted of level 4 non-controlled case series (grade C) and
   level 5 case reports (grade D). Previous reported mutation types
   included glycine substitution (GS, 52.7 \%), in-frame skipping (IFS,
   33.8 \%), non-glycine substitution (NGS, 8.1 \%), and premature
   termination codon (PTC, 5.4 \%). The most common clinical findings were
   extremities involvement, linear configuration, and nail dystrophy. In
   comparison with GS mutation carriers, IFS carriers had a higher
   likelihood of (1) being male (OR 2.99; p = 0.043; 95 \% CI 1.27-11.4)
   and (2) presenting with blisters (OR 4.10; p = 0.013; 95 \% CI
   1.34-12.5).
   Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the first systematic review
   examining the relationship between mutation type and clinical
   presentation in EBP. The findings in this review (1) identify common
   clinical characteristics of EBP that may help in the assessment of
   patients with possible EBP; and (2) indicate that certain mutation
   carriers may have a higher likelihood of exhibiting particular
   phenotypes. In the case of potential diagnostic challenge, assessment
   for presence of common clinical findings as well as molecular testing
   may facilitate correct identification and prognostication.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Clinicians identify seizure onset zones (SOZs) for resection
   in an attempt to localize the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which is the
   cortical tissue that is indispensible for seizure generation. An
   automated system is proposed to objectively localize this EZ by
   identifying regions of interest (ROIs). Methods. Intracranial
   electroencephalogram recordings were obtained from seven patients
   presenting with extratemporal lobe epilepsy and the interaction between
   neuronal rhythms in the form of phase-amplitude coupling was
   investigated. Modulation of the amplitude of high frequency oscillations
   (HFOs) by the phase of low frequency oscillations was measured by
   computing the modulation index (MI). Delta- (0.5-4 Hz) and theta- (4-8
   Hz) modulation of HFOs (30-450 Hz) were examined across the channels of
   a 64-electrode subdural grid. Surrogate analysis was performed and false
   discovery rates were computed to determine the significance of the
   modulation observed. Mean MI values were subjected to eigenvalue
   decomposition (EVD) and channels defining the ROIs were selected based
   on the components of the eigenvector corresponding to the largest
   eigenvalue. ROIs were compared to the SOZs identified by two independent
   neurologists. Global coherence values were also computed. Main results.
   MI was found to capture the seizure in time for six of seven patients
   and identified ROIs in all seven. Patients were found to have a poorer
   post-surgical outcome when the number of EVD-selected channels that were
   not resected increased. Moreover, in patients who experienced a
   seizure-free outcome (i.e., Engel Class I) all EVD-selected channels
   were found to be within the resected tissue or immediately adjacent to
   it. In these Engel Class I patients, delta-modulated HFOs were found to
   identify more of the channels in the resected tissue compared to
   theta-modulated HFOs. However, for the Engel Class IV patient, the
   delta-modulated HFOs did not identify any of the channels in the
   resected tissue suggesting that the resected tissue was not appropriate,
   which was also suggested by the Engel Class IV outcome. A sensitivity of
   75.4\% and a false positive rate of 15.6\% were achieved using
   delta-modulated HFOs in an Engel Class I patient. Significance.
   LFO-modulated HFOs can be used to identify ROIs in extratemporal lobe
   patients. Moreover, delta-modulated HFOs may provide more accurate
   localization of the EZ. These ROIs may result in better surgical
   outcomes when used to compliment the SOZs identified by clinicians for
   resection.}},

Abstract = {{Purolator is a Canadian courier company that recently introduced hybrid
   electric vehicles (HEVs) into their fleets. This paper estimates the
   fuel savings and greenhouse gas reductions for Purolator's hybrid trucks
   using a life-cycle assessment executed with GHGenius, a Government of
   Canada model. Overall, it was found that Purolator's hybrid diesel
   trucks reduce GHG emissions by 23\% and 8\% for city and highway
   driving, respectively. The results confirm that switching to an HEV
   fleet could reduce CO2 emissions during vehicle operations by 25\%, as
   the vehicle manufacturer (Azure Dynamics) has advertised. Moreover, the
   modeled emission reductions (1,668 t CO2 -eq) and fuel savings (609,000
   L) over a distance of 5,200,000 km are similar to Purolator's advertised
   values (1,900 t CO2-eq, 645,000 L). The life-cycle costs of hybrid
   delivery trucks do not presently make them financially favorable
   alternatives to conventional diesel trucks, but their financial
   competitiveness is sensitive to vehicle service life, diesel fuel price,
   assumed discount rate, and incremental hybrid cost. (C) 2014 American

Journal = {{MECHANICS OF MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{83}},
Pages = {{72-89}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{A multiscale model based on synergistic damage mechanics is developed
   for predicting the elastic response of symmetric composite laminates
   containing matrix cracks in plies of multiple orientations, and
   subjected to an arbitrary multiaxial strain state. On the
   micromechanical scale, the proposed multiscale modeling approach invokes
   three-dimensional finite element analysis to characterize the multiaxial
   damage state within the cracked multidirectional laminate, and evaluate
   damage constants required in the damage constitutive model. These damage
   constants capture the ply constraint effects acting on the surface
   displacements of the developed matrix cracks in all off-axis and on-axis
   plies. The representative volume element describing the applied
   multiaxial stress state within the laminate is developed through finite
   element models using periodic boundary conditions, which are necessary
   to accurately represent the physical problem. The developed
   micromechanical models also allow for prediction of the laminate's shear
   deformation response. The model is shown to accurately capture the
   nonlinear stiffness degradation exhibited by cross-ply, quasi-isotropic
   and angle-ply laminates containing matrix cracks in multiple plies and
   subjected to various multiaxial stress states. The prediction results
   are validated by available experimental data and compared with
   independent three-dimensional finite element calculations. The
   multiscale model can easily be implemented into a commercial finite
   element software package in order to predict stiffness degradation in
   composite structures. This will provide a means to predict the integrity
   and durability of these structures, and ultimately lead to
   damage-tolerant designs. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Electrochemical slurry jet micro-machining (ESJM) is a new
   non-conventional process that couples abrasive slurry jet machining
   (ASJM) and electrochemical jet machining (ECJM) concurrently. A
   micro-jet of abrasive particles and electrolytic solution is made to
   impinge on the target while applying a DC potential between the jet
   nozzle and the workpiece. ESJM can be used to remove material that is
   difficult to machine through a combination of erosion, corrosion and
   synergistic effects. This study focuses on ESJM of tungsten carbide (WC)
   using a pH-neutral NaCl electrolyte rather than an alkaline solution
   which is more commonly used in the electrochemical processing of WC. For
   the studied process parameters, it was shown that the erosion due to
   ASJM alone was not able to erode the WC, and that the corrosion under
   ECJM was slow and produced unacceptably wide channels. The combined ESJM
   process however, was found to involve erosion of the developed oxide
   layer and subsequent exposure of un-corroded WC, leading to a much
   higher machining current density, corrosion rate, and machining
   localization than using ECJM alone. It was also found that the total
   abrasive kinetic energy, working voltage and solution concentration
   strongly affected the machining current density, material removal rate
   and aspect ratio (depth to width ratio). The results indicate that ESJM
   has a high potential to machine difficult-to-cut metals efficiently and

Title = {{Priorities in lower limb prosthetic service delivery based on an
   international survey of prosthetists in low- and high-income countries}},

Abstract = {{Background: Prosthetic services, including the provision of an
   appropriate prosthesis, are a crucial part of the rehabilitation process
   for individuals with lower limb amputations. However, globally there
   exist unique challenges in the delivery of prosthetic services that are
   limiting rehabilitation outcomes and consequently the well-being and
   socio-economic status of individuals with lower limb amputations.
   Objectives: The objective of this work was to explore the issues related
   to the provision of appropriate prosthetic technologies and to compare
   these across different economies of the world.
   Study design: Cross-sectional survey.
   Methods: An online survey was developed and distributed to prosthetic
   practitioners providing services in countries around the world. An
   open-coding thematic content analysis procedure was applied to extract
   key themes from the data.
   Results: The response codes defined three overall themes of lower limb
   prosthetic delivery, and several key differences between higher and
   lower income countries emerged. Namely, a higher emphasis on
   part/material availability, practitioner training and durability in
   lower income countries was found. High costs were an issue raised by
   practitioners in all countries.
   Conclusion: Practitioners around the world share many of the same
   concerns; however, some lower income countries face important and
   pressing issues that limit their ability to provide adequate prosthetic
   services.
   Clinical relevance This work highlights the most crucial service and
   technology-related needs, as perceived by trained prosthetic
   practitioners, of populations requiring lower limb prosthetic treatment
   around the world. Additionally, the results may be used to prioritize
   prosthetic-related health-care initiatives led by other researchers,
   governments and organizations working to improve services
   internationally.}},

Title = {{gamma-Irradiation sterilized bone strengthened and toughened by ribose
   pre-treatment}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF THE MECHANICAL BEHAVIOR OF BIOMEDICAL MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{44}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: This study tested the hypothesis that a ribose-based
   pre-treatment would protect the strength, ductility and toughness of
   gamma-irradiation sterilized cortical bone. Methods: Experiment 1: The
   effects of ribose pre-treatment (1.8 M in PBS at 60 degrees C for 24 h)
   prior to 33kGy of irradiation on strength, ductility and toughness
   (beams in three-point bending) and fracture toughness (J-integral at
   instability in single edge notched (bending)) were tested against
   matched non-irradiated and irradiated controls from bovine tibiae.
   Experiment 2: Three-point bending tests were conducted using beams from
   human femora (males, 59-67 years). Bone collagen thermal stability and
   network connectivity were examined using hydrothermal isometric tension
   testing.
   Results: Ribose pre-treatment protected the strength, ductility and
   toughness of irradiation sterilized bovine and human specimens to
   differing degrees. Their ultimate strength was not detectably different
   from non-irradiated control levels; toughness in bovine and human
   specimens was protected by 57 and 76\%, respectively. Untreated human
   bone was less affected by irradiation and ribose pre-treatment was more
   effective in human bone than bovine bone.
   Conclusions: This paper presents the first proof-of-principle that
   irradiation-sterilized bone with improved mechanical properties can be
   produced through the application of a ribose pre-irradiation treatment,
   which provides a more stable and connected collagen network than found
   in conventionally irradiated controls. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Peroxidases have great potential as industrial biocatalysts. In
   particular, the oxidative polymerization of phenolic compounds catalyzed
   by peroxidases has been extensively examined because of the advantage of
   this method over other conventional chemical methods. However, the
   industrial application of peroxidases is often limited because of their
   rapid inactivation by phenoxyl radicals during oxidative polymerization.
   In this work, we report a novel protein engineering approach to improve
   the radical stability of horseradish peroxidase isozyme C (HRPC).
   Phenylalanine residues that are vulnerable to modification by the
   phenoxyl radicals were identified using mass spectrometry analysis.
   UV-Vis and CD spectra showed that radical coupling did not change the
   secondary structure or the active site of HRPC. Four phenylalanine (Phe)
   residues (F68, F142, F143, and F179) were each mutated to alanine
   residues to generate single mutants to examine the role of these sites
   in radical coupling. Despite marginal improvement of radical stability,
   each single mutant still exhibited rapid radical inactivation. To
   further reduce inactivation by radical coupling, the four substitution
   mutations were combined in F68A/F142A/F143A/F179A. This mutant
   demonstrated dramatic enhancement of radical stability by retaining 41\%
   of its initial activity compared to the wild-type, which was completely
   inactivated. Structure and sequence alignment revealed that
   radical-vulnerable Phe residues of HPRC are conserved in homologous
   peroxidases, which showed the same rapid inactivation tendency as HRPC.
   Based on our site-directed mutagenesis and biochemical characterization,
   we have shown that engineering radical-vulnerable residues to eliminate
   multiple radical coupling can be a good strategy to improve the
   stability of peroxidases against radical attack. Biotechnol. Bioeng.

Abstract = {{The practical finite analytic (PFA) method was applied to the solution
   of the one-dimensional advection equation with scale-dependent
   dispersion equation (ASDE) for solute transport in porous media under
   advection-dominated (high Peclet number) conditions. A triangular
   explicit PFA (EPFA) with three different approaches (EPFA 1, 2 and 3)
   and the Crank-Nicolson (CN) centered and upwind techniques were
   developed to solve the ASDE with a dispersivity with linear dependence
   on transport distance. In EPFA 1, to get more accurate results for the
   ASDE, the existing PFA method was developed and combined with the FD
   method. In EPFA 2 the original PFA method was employed to check its
   accuracy for modeling the ASDE without any modifications. Finally, in
   EPFA 3, based on the current PFA solution, new formulations are proposed
   to evaluate the accuracy of this approach. For all conditions, EPFA 3
   has the best behavior in comparison with other numerical techniques for
   different linear functions for distance dependence of dispersivity. (C)

Volume = {{38}},

Abstract = {{The housing search process, a topic of interest to both practitioners
   and researchers, starts with an alternative formation and screening
   practice. Due to the limitation of cognitive capacity, household members
   at this level evaluate potential alternatives based on many factors,
   such as lifestyle, preferences, and so on, to form a manageable choice
   set. This article attempts to provide a detailed study of this screening
   and filtering practice to develop a modeling framework that can
   replicate the choice set formation process. In order to show the
   potential of the method, one prospective decision criteriathe average
   desired commute to work distanceis considered the potential attribute
   that the household evaluates for feasible housing alternatives. It is
   postulated that alternatives will only be included in the choice set if
   the average work distance satisfies the household distance threshold.
   This article explores the viability of using proportional hazard models
   in the housing search process. Some of the specifications of
   hazard-based models that are typically used on temporal data are
   examined on average work distance. Several household sociodemographic
   attributes from eight waves of the Seattle Metropolitan Area's Puget
   Sound Transportation Panel (PSTP) are utilized for model estimation,
   along with built environment variables, characteristics of the supply
   side of the market, and several other economic indicators. The approach
   presented in this article provides a remedy for the large choice set
   problem typically faced in discrete choice modeling.}},

Abstract = {{Oxygen is an essential medicine for the treatment of pneumonia, the
   leading cause of death in children under five worldwide. Yet, providing
   a sufficient and reliable supply of oxygen is a major challenge for many
   health facilities in the developing world, particularly in paediatric
   care units. The cost-effectiveness of oxygen concentrators versus
   compressed gas cylinders as a source of oxygen in low-resource health
   facilities has been demonstrated, but evidence of their long-term
   functionality is scarce. The Biomedical Engineering Department at the
   Medical Research Council Unit in The Gambia manages and maintains 27
   oxygen concentrators at several sites across the country, and has kept
   electronic records of all preventive maintenance checks and repairs on
   these devices since 2006. Through a retrospective analysis of these
   maintenance records, the objective of this study was to assess the
   long-term reliability and maintenance needs of oxygen concentrators in a
   low-income setting with biomedical engineering technologist support. We
   found that the majority of concentrator repairs are low-cost and require
   a low experience level to complete. We estimate that the useful lifespan
   of oxygen concentrators in low-resource settings could reasonably exceed
   7 years provided a system is in place for routine preventive
   maintenance. We conclude the paper with additional insights on the
   broader support ecosystem required to manage and maintain oxygen
   concentrators in low-resource settings.}},

Abstract = {{In 2012, the City of Toronto Environment Office undertook a resilience
   assessment project with the objective of understanding critical
   infrastructure interdependencies, to create a platform for stakeholder
   collaboration on issues related to extreme events, and to improve the
   city's ability to survive and recover from extreme events efficiently.
   Herein this project is reviewed for its large contribution to the
   planning of urban resilience through the construction and analysis of
   dependencies of core city functions. This structure is generalised and
   formalised into a repeatable methodological form invoking the unique
   attributes of the vitae (of life) system of systems formalism to link
   urban resilience planning to the fundamentals of survival, vitality and
   conviviality as desirable outputs of integrated disaster management and
   of urban planning and asset management for sustainable urban

Title = {{The Use of Behavior Change Theory in Internet-Based Asthma
   Self-Management Interventions: A Systematic Review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{17}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Background: The high prevalence rate of asthma represents a major
   societal burden. Advancements in information technology continue to
   affect the delivery of patient care in all areas of medicine.
   Internet-based solutions, social media, and mobile technology could
   address some of the problems associated with increasing asthma
   prevalence.
   Objective: This review evaluates Internet-based asthma interventions
   that were published between 2004 and October 2014 with respect to the
   use of behavioral change theoretical frameworks, applied clinical
   guidelines, and assessment tools.
   Methods: The search term (Asthma AND {[}Online or Internet or Mobile or
   Application or eHealth or App]) was applied to six bibliographic
   databases (Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, BioMed Central, ProQuest Computing, Web
   of Knowledge, and ACM Digital Library) including only English-language
   articles published between 2004 and October 2014. In total, 3932
   articles matched the priori search terms and were reviewed by the
   primary reviewer based on their titles, index terms, and abstracts. The
   matching articles were then screened by the primary reviewer for
   inclusion or exclusion based on their abstract, study type, and
   intervention objectives with respect to the full set of priori inclusion
   and exclusion criteria; 331 duplicates were identified and removed. A
   total of 85 articles were included for in-depth review and the remaining
   3516 articles were excluded. The primary and secondary reviewer
   independently reviewed the complete content of the 85 included articles
   to identify the applied behavioral change theories, clinical guidelines,
   and assessment tools. Findings and any disagreement between reviewers
   were resolved by in-depth discussion and through a consolidation process
   for each of the included articles.
   Results: The reviewers identified 17 out of 85 interventions (20\%)
   where at least one model, framework, and/ or construct of a behavioral
   change theory were applied. The review identified six clinical
   guidelines that were applied across 30 of the 85 interventions (35\%) as
   well as a total of 21 assessment tools that were applied across 32 of
   the 85 interventions (38\%).
   Conclusions: The findings of this literature review indicate that the
   majority of published Internet-based interventions do not use any
   documented behavioral change theory, clinical guidelines, and/ or
   assessment tools to inform their design. Further, it was found that the
   application of clinical guidelines and assessment tools were more
   salient across the reviewed interventions. A consequence, as such, is
   that many Internet-based asthma interventions are designed in an ad hoc
   manner, without the use of any notable evidence-based theoretical
   frameworks, clinical guidelines, and/ or assessment tools.}},

   finger tapping performance}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{109}},
Pages = {{130-139}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{The cerebellum has been associated with timing on the millisecond scale
   and with musical rhythm and beat processing. Early musical training
   (before age 7) is associated with enhanced rhythm synchronization
   performance and differences in cortical motor areas and the corpus
   callosum. In the present study, we examined the relationships between
   regional cerebellar volumes, early musical training, and timing
   performance. We tested adult musicians and non-musicians on a standard
   finger tapping task, and extracted cerebellar gray and white matter
   volumes using a novel multi-atlas automatic segmentation pipeline. We
   found that early-trained musicians had reduced volume in bilateral
   cerebellar white matter and right lobules IV, V and VI, compared to
   late-trained musicians. Strikingly, better timing performance, greater
   musical experience and an earlier age of start of musical training were
   associated with smaller cerebellar volumes. Better timing performance
   was specifically associated with smaller volumes of right lobule VI.
   Collectively, these findings support the sensitivity of the cerebellum
   to the age of initiation of musical training and suggest that lobule VI
   plays a role in timing. The smaller cerebellar volumes associated with
   musical training and timing performance may be a reflection of more
   efficiently implemented low-level timing and sensorimotor processes. (C)

Abstract = {{Banks occasionally employ frontier efficiency analyses to objectively
   identify best practices within their organizations. Amongst such
   methods, Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was found to be one of the

   focus on assessing the growth potential of individual branches.
   This research presents five models that examine three perspectives of
   branch growth. Each model was applied to the branch network of one of
   Canada's top five banks to gauge the growth potential of individual
   branches and to provide tailored improvement recommendations. Using
   various analysis methodologies, the results of each model were examined
   and their functionality assessed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Journal = {{FUEL}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{145}},
Pages = {{202-213}},
Month = {{APR 1}},
Abstract = {{A series of adsorption-alkalization experiments were conducted in a
   muffle furnace on two types of blast furnace cokes at 1300 degrees C in
   the presence of alkali vapors. Coke textures were found to peel off
   layer by layer after the alkalization process by potassium vapor, and
   macro fissures were observed for K/Coke ratios higher than 3/100. This
   phenomenon was not observed in the coke samples alkalized by sodium
   vapor. A number of additional potassium-bearing and sodium-bearing
   phases were detected with scanning electron microscope and energy
   dispersive spectrometer after the alkalization process. The formation of
   kalsilite or potassium aluminum silicate (KAlSiO4) and sodium alumina
   silicates (Na6Al4Si4O17) was confirmed through X-ray diffraction,
   however the formation of intercalation compounds that were expected to
   form in the alkalized coke samples could not be confirmed. The catalytic
   effect of sodium and potassium-bearing minerals appeared to be quite
   similar; the degradation of coke strength by sodium was however found to
   be stronger than that caused by potassium. The severe degradation of
   coke quality caused by alkali vapors was attributed to their strong
   influence on the coke carbon matrix, coke minerals, as well as their
   catalytic effect on the carbon gasification reaction. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Title = {{Exploring impacts of process technology development and regional factors
   on life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of corn stover ethanol}},
Journal = {{RENEWABLE ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{76}},
Pages = {{726-734}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{This paper examines impacts of regional factors affecting biomass and
   process input supply chains and ongoing technology development on the
   life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of ethanol production from
   corn stover in the U.S. Corn stover supply results in GHG emissions from
   6 gCO(2)eq./MJ ethanol (Macon County, Missouri) to 13 gCO(2)eq./MJ
   ethanol (Hardin County, Iowa), reflecting location-specific soil carbon,
   and N2O emissions responses to stover removal. Biorefinery emissions
   based on the 2011 National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) process
   model are the single greatest emissions source (18 gCO(2)eq./MJ ethanol)
   and are approximately double those assessed for the 2002 NREL design
   model, due primarily to the inclusion of GHG-intensive inputs (caustic,
   ammonia, glucose). Energy demands of on-site enzyme production included
   in the 2011 design contribute to reducing the electricity co-product and
   associated emissions credit, which is also dependent on the
   GHG-intensity of regional electricity supply. Life cycle emissions vary
   between 1.5 and 22 gCO(2)eq./MJ ethanol (2011 design) depending on
   production location (98\%-77\% reduction vs. gasoline). Using system
   expansion for co-product allocation, ethanol production in studied
   locations meet the Energy Independence and Security Act emissions
   requirements for cellulosic biofuels; however, regional factors and
   on-going technology developments significantly influence these results.

Abstract = {{Motivated by application of Gaussian sum filters (GSF) and multiple
   model adaptive estimation (MMAE) approaches in scenarios where
   assumption of proper (circular) Gaussian signals is not valid, the
   letter proposes a novel complex-valued Gaussian sum filter (C/GSF) for
   non-linear filtering of non-Gaussian/non-circular measurement noise.
   Although the literature on recursive state estimation using GSF is rich,
   its complex-valued counterpart which incorporates the full second-order
   statistics of the system and can cope with
   non-Gaussian/non-circular-measurements, has not yet been investigated in
   the literature. The paper addresses this gap. The C/GSF is a
   computationally attractive adaptive filter where the number of
   non-circular Gaussian components is controlled utilizing a modified
   Bayesian learning technique which is used to collapse the resulting
   non-Gaussian sum mixture into an equivalent complex-valued Gaussian
   term. Simulation results indicate that the C/GSF provides significant
   performance improvement over its traditional counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{RATIONALE: The manufacturing and uses of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH)
   have resulted in a serious environmental challenge and legacy. This
   study highlights the ability of compound specific isotope analysis
   (CSIA) to distinguish among various HCH sources and to support the
   evaluation of the potential for in situ biodegradation in contaminated
   groundwater.
   METHODS: Tests were conducted to verify the absence of significant
   isotope fractionation during HCH sample pre-concentration including
   dichloromethane extraction, solvent exchange into iso-octane, and H2SO4
   clean-up, and analysis by gas chromatography/combustion-isotope ratio
   mass spectrometry (GC/C-IRMS). The method was then applied to four
   Technical Grade (TG) HCH mixtures procured from different sources and to
   groundwater samples from a contaminated site.
   RESULTS: The pre-concentration method enabled determination of carbon
   isotope ratios (delta C-13 values) of HCH isomers with no significant
   isotopic fractionation. The TG-HCH mixtures had significantly different
   delta C-13 values. Moreover, for any given TG-HCH, all isomers had delta
   C-13 values within 1.1 parts per thousand of each other - a distinctly
   uniform fingerprint. At the HCH-contaminated field site, compared with
   source wells, downgradient wells showed significant (up to 5.1 parts per
   thousand) enrichment in C-13 and the delta C-13 values of the HCH
   isomers were significantly different from each other.
   CONCLUSIONS: A method was successfully developed for the CSIA of HCH
   isomers that showed potential for HCH source differentiation and
   identification of HCH in situ biodegradation. At the HCH-contaminated
   site, the observed preferential isotopic enrichment of certain isomers
   relative to others for a given source allows differentiation between
   biodegraded and non-biodegraded HCH. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \&

Abstract = {{The dissociation of water on 2D monolayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)
   edges was studied with density functional theory. The catalytically
   active sites for H2O, H, and OH adsorption on MoS2 edges with 0\%
   (Mo-edge), 50\% (S50-edge), and 100\% (S100-edge) sulfur coverage were
   determined, and the Mo-edge was found to be the most favorable for
   adsorption of all species. The water dissociation reaction was then
   simulated on all edges using the climbing image nudged elastic band
   (CI-NEB) technique. The reaction was found to be endothermic on the
   S100-edge and exothermic for the S50- and Mo-edges, with the Mo-edge
   having the lowest activation energy barrier. Water dissociation was then
   explored on the Mo-edge using metadynamics biased ab initio molecular
   dynamics (AIMD) methods to explore the reaction mechanism at finite
   temperature. These simulations revealed that water dissociation can
   proceed by two mechanisms: the first by splitting into adsorbed OH and H
   species produced a particularly small activation free energy barrier of
   0.06 eV (5.89 kJ/mol), and the second by formation of desorbed H2 and
   adsorbed O atom had a higher activation barrier of 0.36 eV (34.74
   kJ/mol) which was nevertheless relatively small. These activation
   barrier results, along with reaction rate calculations, suggest that
   water dissociation will occur spontaneously at room temperature on the
   Mo-edge.}},

   subluminal regime}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW E}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{91}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 24}},
Abstract = {{Spectral reshaping and nonuniform phase delay associated with an
   electromagnetic pulse propagating in a temporally dispersive medium may
   lead to interesting observations in which the group velocity becomes
   superluminal or even negative. In such cases, the finite bandwidth of
   the superluminal region implies the inevitable existence of a cutoff
   distance beyond which a superluminal pulse becomes subluminal. In this
   paper, we derive a closed-form analytic expression to estimate this
   cutoff distance in abnormal dispersive media with gain. Moreover, the
   method of steepest descent is used to track the time-frequency dynamics
   associated with the evolution of the center of mass of a superluminal
   pulse to the subluminal regime. This evolution takes place at longer
   propagation depths as a result of the subluminal components affecting
   the behavior of the pulse. Finally, the analysis presents the
   fundamental limitations of superluminal propagation in light of factors
   such as the medium depth, pulse width, and the medium dispersion
   strength.}},

Abstract = {{Flat, lambda/2-spaced phased arrays for therapeutic ultrasound were
   examined in silico and in vitro. All arrays were made by combining
   modules made of 64 square elements with 1.5 mm inter-element spacing
   along both major axes. The arrays were designed to accommodate
   integrated, co-aligned diagnostic transducers for targeting and
   monitoring. Six arrays of 1024 elements (16 modules) and four arrays of
   6144 elements (96 modules) were modelled and compared according to
   metrics such as peak pressure amplitude, focal size, ability to be
   electronically-steered far off-axis and grating lobe amplitude. Two 1024
   element prototypes were built and measured in vitro, producing over 100
   W of acoustic power. In both cases, the simulation model of the pressure
   amplitude field was in good agreement with values measured by
   hydrophone. Using one of the arrays, it was shown that the peak pressure
   amplitude dropped by only 24\% and 25\% of the on-axis peak pressure
   amplitude when steered to the edge of the array (40 mm) at depths of 30
   mm and 50 mm. For the 6144 element arrays studied in in silico only,
   similarly high steerability was found: even when steered 100 mm
   off-axis, the pressure amplitude decrease at the focus was less than
   20\%, while the maximum pressure grating lobe was only 20\%. Thermal
   simulations indicate that the modules produce more than enough acoustic
   power to perform rapid ablations at physiologically relevant depths and
   steering angles. Arrays such as proposed and tested in this study have
   enormous potential: their high electronic steerability suggests that
   they will be able to perform ablations of large volumes without the need
   for any mechanical translation.}},

Abstract = {{Myelin basic protein (MBP) is an intrinsically disordered (unstructured)
   protein known to play an important role in the stability of myelin's
   multilamellar membrane structure in the central nervous system. The
   adsorption of MBP and its capacity to interact with and bridge solid
   substrates has been studied using a surface forces apparatus (SFA) and a
   quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D). Adsorption
   experiments show that MBP molecules adsorb to the surfaces in a swollen
   state before undergoing a conformational change into a more compact
   structure with a thickness of similar to 3 nm. Moreover, this compact
   structure is able to interact with nearby mica surfaces to form adhesive
   bridges. The measured adhesion force (energy) between two bridged
   surfaces is 1.0 +/- 0.1 mN/m, (E-ad = 0.21 +/- 0.02 mJ/m(2)), which is
   slightly smaller than our previously reported adhesion force of 1.7 mN/m
   (E-ad = 0.36 mJ/m(2)) for MBP adsorbed on two supported lipid bilayers
   (Lee et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014, 111, E768-E775). The
   saturated surface concentration of compact MBP on a single SiO2 surface
   reaches a stable value of 310 +/- 10 ng/cm(2) regardless of the bulk MBP
   concentration. A kinetic three-step adsorption model was developed that
   accurately fits the adsorption data. The developed model is a general
   model, not limited to intrinsically disordered proteins, that can be
   extended to the adsorption of various chemical compounds that undergo
   chemical reactions and/or conformational changes upon adsorbing to
   surfaces. Taken together with our previously published data (Lee et al.,
   Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2014, 111, E768-E775), the present results
   confirm that conformational changes of MBP upon adsorption are a key for
   strong adhesion, and that such conformational changes are strongly
   dependent on the nature of the surfaces.}},

Abstract = {{Carbon capture, storage, and utilization has emerged as an essential
   technology for near-term CO, emission control. The largest CO2 projects
   globally combine storage and oil recovery. The efficiency of this
   process relies critically on the miScibility of CO, in crude oils at
   reservoir conditions. We present a,microfluidic approach to quantify the
   minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) that leverages the inherent
   fluorescence Of crude oils, is faster aim conventional technologies, and
   provides quantitatiVe, operator-independerit measurements. To validate
   the approach synthetic oil Mixtures of known composition (pentane,
   hexadecane), are tested and MMP values affect compared to reported
   values. Results differ by less than 0.5 MPa on average, in contrast to
   comparison between conventional methods with variations on the order of
   1-2 MPa. In terms of speed, a pressure scan for a single MMP measurement
   required less than 30 min (with potential to be sub-10 min), hi stark
   contrast to days or weeks with existing approaches. The method is
   applied to determine the MMP for Pennsylvania, West Texas, and Saudi
   crudes. Importantly, our fluorescence-based approach enables rapid;
   automated, operator-independent measurement of MMP as needed to inform
   the world's largest CO2 projects.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{106}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{MAR 16}},
Abstract = {{Two main applications requiring high friction on ice are automobile
   tires and footwear. The main motivation behind the use of soft rubbers
   in these applications is the relatively high friction force generated
   between a smooth rubber contacting smooth ice. Unfortunately, the
   friction force between rubber and ice is very low at temperatures near
   the melting point of ice and as a result we still experience automobile
   accidents and pedestrian slips and falls in the winter. Here, we report
   on a class of compliant fiber-composite materials with textured surfaces
   that provide outstanding coefficients of friction on wet ice. The
   fibrous composites consist of a hard glass-fiber phase reinforcing a
   compliant thermoplastic polyurethane matrix. The glass-fiber phase is
   textured such that it is aligned transversally and protruding out of the
   elastomer surface. Our analysis indicates that the exposed fiber phase
   exhibits a ``micro-cleat{''} effect, allowing for it to fracture the ice
   and increase the interfacial contact area thereby requiring a high force
   to shear the interface. (C) 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

   the light concentrator's focal distance is directly proportional to the
   thickness of the lens, opposite to conventional dielectric lenses. It is
   then shown that the same hetero-junction structure can be used as a
   near-field beam-splitter when illuminated from the back, in addition to
   its concentration property. Equal and unequal beam splitting, as well as
   beam shifting can be achieved using a very thin device. (C) 2015 Optical

Abstract = {{A thin film Mo oxide-nitride pseudocapacitive electrode was synthesized
   by electrodeposition of Mo oxide on Ti and a subsequent low-temperature
   (400 degrees C) thermal nitridation. Two nitridation environments, N-2
   and NH3, were used and the results were compared. Surface analyses of
   these nitrided films showed partial conversion of Mo oxide to nitrides,
   with a lower conversion percentage being the film produced in N-2.
   However, the electrochemical analyses showed that the surface of the
   N-2-treated film had better pseudocapacitive behaviors and outperformed
   that nitrided in NH3. Cycle life of the resultant N-2-treated Mo
   oxide-nitride was also much improved over Mo oxide. A two-electrode cell
   using Mo oxide-nitride electrodes was demonstrated and showed high rate
   performance. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Pages = {{1528-1542}},

Abstract = {{Motivated by the problem of estimating the discrete and continuous
   states of an improper complex-valued stochastic hybrid system, the paper
   proposes a class of widely linear (augmented) multiple model adaptive
   estimation algorithms, referred to as the C/MMAE. We show that for an
   improper complex-valued signal, pseudo-covariance of the innovation
   sequence is not zero and, therefore, carries useful statistical
   information regarding the unknown behaviour mode of the hybrid system. A
   new Bayesian law is, therefore, derived as a function of the
   pseudo-covariance of the innovation sequence and used to compute the
   probability that a hypothesized model is in effect at a certain time. We
   show that the C/MMAE, which uses the new Bayesian law and utilizes the
   complete second-order statistical characterization of the complex-valued
   innovation sequence, convergences faster than its counterpart, which
   only uses the conventional covariance of the innovation sequence. In
   order to simplify the computational complexity, we develop two
   circularized versions of the C/MMAE using a preprocessing step, referred
   to as the circularizing filter (CF). The CF is incorporated to convert
   the improper observations/innovations into the proper ones in order to
   reduce the computational complexity of the hypothesis testing step.
   Finally, an interacting version of the C/MMAE, referred to as C/IMM, is
   developed for improper complex-valued systems with Markovian switching
   coefficients. Simulation results indicate that the proposed hybrid
   estimators provide improved performance and convergence properties over
   their traditional counterparts.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we have assessed the potential application of dichloro
   silicon phthalocyanine (Cl-2-SiPc) and dichloro germanium phthalocyanine
   (Cl-2-GePc) in modern planar heterojunction organic photovoltaic (PHJ
   OPV) devices. We have determined that Cl-2-SiPc can act as an electron
   donating material when paired with C60 and that Cl-2-SiPc or Cl-2-GePc
   can also act as an electron acceptor material when paired with
   pentacene. These two materials enabled the harvesting of triplet energy
   resulting from the singlet fission process in pentacene. However,
   contributions to the generation of photocurrent were observed for
   Cl-2-SiPc with no evidence of photocurrent contribution from Cl-2-GePc.
   The result of our initial assessment established the potential for the
   application of SiPc and GePc in PHJ OPV devices. Thereafter,
   bis(pentafluoro phenoxy) silicon phthalocyanine (F-10-SiPc) and
   bis(pentafluoro phenoxy) germanium phthalocyanine (F-10-GePc) were
   synthesized and characterized. During thermal processing, it was
   discovered that F-10-SiPc and F-10-GePc underwent a reaction forming
   small amounts of difluoro SiPc (F-2-SiPc) and difluoro GePc (F-2-GePc).
   This undesirable reaction could be circumvented for F-10-SiPc but not
   for F-10-GePc. Using single crystal X-ray diffraction, it was determined
   that F-10-SiPc has significantly enhanced p-p interactions compared with
   that of Cl-2-SiPc, which had little to none. Unoptimized PHJ OPV devices
   based on F-10-SiPc were fabricated and directly compared to those
   constructed from Cl-2-SiPc, and in all cases, PHJ OPV devices based on
   F-10-SiPc had significantly improved device characteristics compared to
   Cl-2-SiPc.}},

Abstract = {{In order to improve the properties of electrodes based on carbon
   nanotubes (CNTs), nanocomposite electrodes of CNTs/activated carbon (AC)
   are prepared. The effect of CNT loadings on the performance of the
   nanocomposite electrodes is evaluated by electrochemical methods.
   Scanning electron microscopy images show the CNTs are well dispersed,
   entwine with the AC, and form a more conductive network in a
   nanocomposite electrode. When CNT loadings increase from 0 to 10wt\%,
   the capacitance increases by 15\% (89.4 to 102.5Fg(-1)), and the
   equivalent series resistance (ESR) decreases by 13\% (0.93 to 0.81). The
   capacitance improvement has an optimum CNT loading of about 6 to 10wt\%.
   The decreased ESR with high CNT loadings does not prevent capacitance
   loss at sweep rates greater than 50mVs(-1). The nanocomposite electrode
   shows good cycle performance with no capacity loss after 5000cycles at a
   scan rate of 500mVs(-1). These results indicate that the CNT-based
   nanocomposite electrodes would be a promising material for use in

Abstract = {{The dynamics of indoor environmental conditions, human occupancy, and
   operational characteristics of buildings influence human comfort and
   indoor environmental quality, including the survival and progression of
   microbial communities. A suite of continuous, long-term environmental
   and operational parameters were measured in ten patient rooms and two
   nurse stations in a new hospital building in Chicago, IL to characterize
   the indoor environment in which microbial samples were taken for the
   Hospital Microbiome Project. Measurements included environmental
   conditions (indoor dry-bulb temperature, relative humidity, humidity
   ratio, and illuminance) in the patient rooms and nurse stations;
   differential pressure between the patient rooms and hallways; surrogate
   measures for human occupancy and activity in the patient rooms using
   both indoor air CO2 concentrations and infrared doorway beam-break
   counters; and outdoor air fractions in the heating, ventilating, and
   air-conditioning systems serving the sampled spaces. Measurements were
   made at 5-minute intervals over consecutive days for nearly one year,
   providing a total of similar to 8x10(6) data points. Indoor temperature,
   illuminance, and human occupancy/ activity were all weakly correlated
   between rooms, while relative humidity, humidity ratio, and outdoor air
   fractions showed strong temporal (seasonal) patterns and strong spatial
   correlations between rooms. Differential pressure measurements confirmed
   that all patient rooms were operated at neutral pressure. The patient
   rooms averaged about 100 combined entrances and exits per day, which
   suggests they were relatively lightly occupied compared to higher
   traffic environments (e.g., retail buildings) and more similar to lower
   traffic office environments. There were also clear differences in
   several environmental parameters before and after the hospital was
   occupied with patients and staff. Characterizing and understanding
   factors that influence these building dynamics is vital for hospital
   environments, where they can impact patient health and the survival and
   spread of healthcare associated infections.}},

Abstract = {{Progress in urban climate science is severely restricted by the lack of
   useful information that describes aspects of the form and function of
   cities at a detailed spatial resolution. To overcome this shortcoming we
   are initiating an international effort to develop the World Urban
   Database and Access Portal Tools (WUDAPT) to gather and disseminate this
   information in a consistent manner for urban areas worldwide. The first
   step in developing WUDAPT is a description of cities based on the Local
   Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme, which classifies natural and urban landscapes
   into categories based on climate-relevant surface properties. This
   methodology provides a culturally-neutral framework for collecting
   information about the internal physical structure of cities. Moreover,
   studies have shown that remote sensing data can be used for supervised
   LCZ mapping. Mapping of LCZs is complicated because similar LCZs in
   different regions have dissimilar spectral properties due to differences
   in vegetation, building materials and other variations in cultural and
   physical environmental factors. The WUDAPT protocol developed here
   provides an easy to understand workflow; uses freely available data and
   software; and can be applied by someone without specialist knowledge in
   spatial analysis or urban climate science. The paper also provides an
   example use of the WUDAPT project results.}},

Title = {{On the piezoelectric potential of gallium nitride nanotubes}},
Journal = {{NANO ENERGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Pages = {{322-330}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The piezoelectric potential of strained intrinsic gallium nitride (GaN)
   nanotubes (NTs) has been studied analytically and numerically. The
   material properties used are obtained from molecular dynamics
   simulations (MDSs) and found to depend on the temperature and the NT's
   wall thickness. A novel core-surface model is developed to explain the
   size-dependent phenomenon and also used to predict the material
   properties for large-scale structures, where MDSs are not feasible. The
   obtained results show that GaN NTs can generate a much higher
   piezoelectric potential than their nanowire (NW) counterparts due to
   distinct material and geometric properties of NTs. This observation is
   not only limit for the present intrinsic structures but also can be
   expected for the as-grown structures. The influence of material and
   geometric properties becomes more significant for NTs with smaller
   radius or wall thickness-to-radius ratio and may enhance the
   piezoelectric potential by up to ten times for intrinsic NTs. However,
   the temperature is found to have no significant influence on the
   improvement of the piezoelectric potential of NTs. The observed improved
   piezoelectric potential in GaN NTs together with some other advantages
   of NTs, such as more efficient surface functionalization, suggests that
   the GaN NT can be a better candidate for the building blocks in
   piezotronic nanodevices compared with the most commonly used NWs. (C)

Abstract = {{Should energy storage buy and sell power at wholesale prices like
   utilities and generators, or should its physical and financial operation
   be asynchronyous as with transmission lines? In the first case, storage
   straightforwardly profits through inter-temporal arbitrage, also known
   as load shifting and peak shaving. In this paper, the latter case,
   referred to as passive storage, is examined. Because passive storage
   does not make nodal price transactions, new mechanisms are necessary for
   its integration into electricity markets. This issue is addressed by
   further developing the analogy between energy storage and transmission.
   Specifically, financial rights are defined for storage, and tracing is
   extended to multiperiod power flows linked by storage. Like flowgate
   transmission rights, the new financial storage rights redistribute the
   system operator's merchandising surplus and enable risk-averse market
   participants to hedge against nodal price volatility resulting from
   storage congestion. Simple examples are given demonstrating the
   implementation of the new mechanisms. Game-theoretic analysis suggests
   that financial storage rights mitigate gaming when both the generator
   and load bid strategically.}},

   of HSEE are used as inputs and accomplishment of HSEE programs is used
   as output for the algorithm. Moreover, this algorithm is used to rank
   operators performance with respect to HSEE. Finally, the algorithm
   identifies efficient operators with respect to HSEE. This is the first

Abstract = {{Methods that increase cardiomyocyte survival upon exposure to ischemia,
   hypoxia and reoxygenation injuries are required to improve the efficacy
   of cardiac cell therapy and enhance the viability and function of
   engineered tissues. We investigated the effect of combined hypoxia/NaNO2
   pretreatment on rat neonatal cardiomyocyte (CM), cardiac fibroblast, and
   human embryonic stem cell-derived CM (hESC-CM) survival upon exposure to
   hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) injury in vitro. Cells were pretreated with
   and without hypoxia and/or various concentrations of NaNO2 for 20 min,
   then incubated for 2 h under hypoxic conditions, followed by 2 h in
   normoxia. The control cells were maintained under normoxia for 4 h.
   Pretreatment with either hypoxia or NaNO2 significantly increased CM
   viability but had no effect on cardiac fibroblast viability. Combined
   hypoxia/NaNO2 pretreatment significantly increased CM viability but
   significantly decreased cardiac fibroblast viability. In rat neonatal
   CMs, cell death, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity,
   was significantly reduced with hypoxia/NaNO2 pretreatment; and in
   hESC-CMs, hypoxia/NaNO2 pretreatment increased the BCL-2/BAX gene
   expression ratio, suggesting that hypoxia/NaNO2 pretreatment promotes
   cell viability by downregulating apoptosis. Additionally, we found a
   correlation between the prosurvival effect of hypoxia/NaNO2 pretreatment
   and the myoglobin content of the cells by comparing neonatal rat
   ventricular and atrial CMs, which express high and low myoglobin
   respectively. Functionally, hypoxia/NaNO2 pretreatment significantly
   improved the excitation threshold upon H/R injury to the level observed
   for uninjured cells, whereas pretreatment did not affect the maximum
   capture rate. Hence, hypoxia/NaNO2 pretreatment may serve as a strategy
   to increase CM survival in cardiac regenerative therapy applications and
   tissue engineering. (c) 2015 American Institute of Chemical Engineers

Abstract = {{A common source of error when detecting heel-strike moments utilizing
   split force-plate treadmills is unwillingly stepping on contra-lateral
   force-plate. In this study, we quantified this error when heel-strike
   was detected based on such erroneous data and compared three methods to
   investigate how well the heel-strikes and stride-intervals were detected
   with erroneous data. Eleven subjects walked on a split force-plate
   treadmill for more than 20 min. We used 20 N and 50\% body-weight
   thresholds to detect the heel-strike moments (HS20N and HS50\%,
   respectively). Besides, we used linear approximation to estimate the
   unaffected force profile from affected force-plate data, and
   subsequently to detect the heel-strike moments (HSest). We used
   heel-strike moments detected by a foot-switch as a reference to compare
   accuracy of HS20N, HS50\% and HSest. HS20N and HSest detected
   heel-strike moments accurately for unaffected force-plate data
   (median(max) errors for all subjects: 9(23) and 9(37) ms) but HS50\%
   showed significantly larger errors (52(74) ms). Unlike HS50\% and HSest,
   HS20N was considerably affected by the affected force-plate data (23(68)
   ms). The error in stride-interval measurement was relatively small using
   any methods for unaffected force-plate data (3(7), 6(8), and 6(12) ms),
   while stride-interval errors were large for some subjects when using
   HS20N for affected data (6(175) ms).
   We concluded that unwillingly stepping on contra-lateral force-plate
   occurred a few percent and up to 37.7\% of all strides (median: 12.9\%).
   Our proposed method (HSest) robustly showed small errors for heel-strike
   detection and stride-interval calculation consistently among subjects,
   while HS50\% and HS20N showed large errors depending on subjects. (C)

Abstract = {{A theoretical one-dimensional two-layer linear photocarrier radiometry
   (PCR) model including the presence of effective interface carrier traps
   was used to evaluate the transport parameters of p-type hydrogenated
   amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) and n-type crystalline silicon (c-Si)
   passivated by an intrinsic hydrogenated amorphous silicon (i-layer)
   nanolayer. Several crystalline Si heterojunction structures were
   examined to investigate the influence of the i-layer thickness and the
   doping concentration of the a-Si: H layer. The experimental data of a
   series of heterojunction structures with intrinsic thin layers were
   fitted to PCR theory to gain insight into the transport properties of
   these devices. The quantitative multi-parameter results were studied
   with regard to measurement reliability (uniqueness) and precision using
   two independent computational best-fit programs. The considerable
   influence on the transport properties of the entire structure of two key
   parameters that can limit the performance of amorphous thin film solar
   cells, namely, the doping concentration of the a-Si: H layer and the
   i-layer thickness was demonstrated. It was shown that PCR can be applied
   to the non-destructive characterization of a-Si: H/c-Si heterojunction
   solar cells yielding reliable measurements of the key parameters. (C)

Abstract = {{Background-Hydrogels are being actively investigated for direct delivery
   of cells or bioactive molecules to the heart after myocardial infarction
   (MI) to prevent cardiac functional loss. We postulate that
   immobilization of the prosurvival angiopoietin-1-derived peptide,
   QHREDGS, to a chitosan-collagen hydrogel could produce a clinically
   translatable thermoresponsive hydrogel to attenuate post-MI cardiac
   remodeling.
   Methods and Results-In a rat MI model, QHREDGS-conjugated hydrogel
   (QHG213H), control gel, or PBS was injected into the peri-infarct/MI
   zone. By in vivo tracking and chitosan staining, the hydrogel was
   demonstrated to remain in situ for 2 weeks and was cleared in
   approximate to 3 weeks. By echocardiography and pressure-volume
   analysis, the QHG213H hydrogel significantly improved cardiac function
   compared with the controls. Scar thickness and scar area fraction were
   also significantly improved with QHG213H gel injection compared with the
   controls. There were significantly more cardiomyocytes, determined by
   cardiac troponin-T staining, in the MI zone of the QHG213H hydrogel
   group; and hydrogel injection did not induce a significant inflammatory
   response as assessed by polymerase chain reaction and an inflammatory
   cytokine assay. The interaction of cardiomyocytes and cardiac
   fibroblasts with QHREDGS was found to be mediated by beta(1)-integrins.
   Conclusions-We demonstrated for the first time that the QHG213H
   peptide-modified hydrogel can be injected in the beating heart where it
   remains localized for a clinically effective period. Moreover, the
   QHG213H hydrogel induced significant cardiac functional and
   morphological improvements after MI relative to the controls.}},

Abstract = {{This work analyzes the temperature distribution inside the
   microwave-heated lignocellulosic biomass samples through experiments and
   finite element modeling. Dielectric properties of the samples were
   measured with a coaxial probe technique. The results showed that the
   biomasses were weak absorbers of microwave radiation with a low loss
   tangent of less than 0.1, suggesting the need of adding strong
   microwave-absorbing agent. To measure temperature during microwave
   heating, pressure probes were designed, built, calibrated and used. With
   the added microwave absorber (KOH), the temperature at the center of the
   sample was found to reach a plateau between 600 and 800 degrees C after
   about 4 min. Using COMSOL multiphysics, a 3-D model was developed to
   simulate the temperature distribution in microwave-heated samples. The
   model yielded a time-dependence of temperature that was similar to one
   measured with the probe. Microwave pyrolysis could result in a
   non-uniform temperature distribution even after the plateau temperature
   was reached. The degree of non-uniformity changes with thermal
   properties of samples, such as heat conductivity and capacity. (C) 2015

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Since natural gas is odorless, to assure the customer safety, odorants
   are added to it to alarm the consumer in the case of a gas leak.
   Although the odorization is a common practice in natural gas
   distribution systems, odor fading has been reported in pipelines, which
   is a great safety risk. This paper summarizes results of experiments
   conducted to investigate possible chemical and physical mechanisms
   responsible for odor fading. In these experiments, X-ray photoelectron
   spectroscopy (XPS) and gas chromatography were used to check the
   possible interactions of tertiary butyl mercaptan (TBM) as odorant with
   the pipe material. Evidences of chemisorption, adsorption and desorption
   of TBM on the iron oxide inside the pipe were observed. It was found
   that by increasing pressure, rusted surface of the pipe, and temperature
   or by decreasing the gas flow rate and odorant concentration the
   mercaptan removal was increased. (C) 2015 The Institution of Chemical

Abstract = {{Inorganic natiOpatticles are ideal precursors for engineering barcodes
   for rapidly detecting diseases. Despite advances in the chemical design
   of these barcodes, they have not advanced to clinical use because they
   lack sensitivity and are not cost-effective due to requirement of a
   large read-out system. Here we combined recent advances in quantum dot
   `barcode technology with smattphones and isothermal amplification to
   engineer a simple and low-cost chip-based wireless multiplex diagnostic
   device. We characterized the analytical peittfinance of this device and
   demonstrated that the deviceis capable of detecting down to 1000 viral
   genetic copies per milliliter, and this enabled the diagnosis of
   patients infected with HIV or hepatitis B. More importantly, the
   barcoding enabled us to detect multiple infectious pathogens
   simultaneously, in a-single test, in less than 1 h. This multiplexing
   capability of the device enables the diagnosis of infections that are
   difficult to differentiate clinically due to common symptoms such as a
   fever or rash. The integration of quantum dot barcoding technology with
   a smattphone-reader provides a capacity for global surveillance of
   infectious diseases and the potential to accelerate knowledge exchange
   transfer of emerging or exigent disease threats with healthcare and

   changes provide an objective and language-free measure of arousal
   associated with anxiety, which can complement treatment programs for
   clinical populations who have difficulty with introspection,
   communication, and emotion recognition. This motivates the development
   of automatic methods for detection of anxiety-related arousal using
   physiology signals. While several supervised learning methods have been
   proposed for this purpose, these methods require regular collection and
   updating of training data and are, therefore, not suitable for clinical
   populations, where obtaining labelled data may be challenging due to
   impairments in communication and introspection. In this context, the
   objective of this paper is to develop an unsupervised and real-time
   arousal detection algorithm. Methods: We propose a learning framework
   based on the Kalman filtering theory for detection of physiological
   arousal based on cardiac activity. The performance of the system was
   evaluated on data obtained from a sample of children with autism
   spectrum disorder. Results: The results indicate that the system can
   detect anxiety-related arousal in these children with sensitivity and
   specificity of 99\% and 92\%, respectively. Conclusion and significance:
   Our results show that the proposed method can detect physiological
   arousal associated with anxiety with high accuracy, providing support
   for technical feasibility of augmenting anxiety treatments with
   automatic detection techniques. This approach can ultimately lead to
   more effective anxiety treatment for a larger and more diverse
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-tier architecture improves the spatial reuse of radio spectrum in
   cellular networks, but it introduces complicated heterogeneity in the
   spatial distribution of transmitters, which brings new challenges in
   interference analysis. In this work, we present a stochastic geometric
   model for evaluating the uplink interference in a two-tier network
   considering multi-type users and base stations. Each type of tier-1
   users and tier-2 base stations aremodeled as independent homogeneous
   Poisson point processes, and tier-2 users are modeled as locally
   non-homogeneous clustered Poisson point processes centered at tier-2
   base stations. By applying a superposition-aggregation-superposition
   approach, we quantify the interference at both tiers. Our model is also
   able to capture the impact of two types of exclusion regions, where
   either tier-2 base stations or tier-2 users are restricted to avoid
   cross-tier interference. As an important application of this analytical
   model, an intensity planning scenario is investigated, in which we aim
   to maximize the total income of the network operator with respect to the
   intensities of tier-2 cells, under constraints on the outage
   probabilities of tier-1 and tier-2 users. The result of our interference
   analysis suggests that this maximization can be converted to a standard
   convex optimization problem. Finally, numerical studies further
   demonstrate the correctness of our analysis.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Visual and auditory systems interact at both cortical and subcortical
   levels. Studies suggest a highly context-specific cross-modal modulation
   of the auditory system by the visual system. The present study builds on
   this work by sampling data from 17 young healthy adults to test whether
   visual speech stimuli evoke different responses in the auditory efferent
   system compared to visual non-speech stimuli. The descending cortical
   influences on medial olivocochlear (MOC) activity were indirectly
   assessed by examining the effects of contralateral suppression of
   transient-evoked otoacoustic emissions (TEOAEs) at 1, 2, 3 and 4 kHz
   under three conditions: (a) in the absence of any contralateral noise
   (Baseline), (b) contralateral noise observing facial speech gestures
   related to productions of vowels /a/and /u/and (c) contralateral noise +
   observing facial non-speech gestures related to smiling and frowning.
   The results are based on 7 individuals whose data met strict recording
   criteria and indicated a significant difference in TEOAE suppression
   between observing speech gestures relative to the non-speech gestures,
   but only at the 1 kHz frequency. These results suggest that observing a
   speech gesture compared to a non-speech gesture may trigger a difference
   in MOC activity, possibly to enhance peripheral neural encoding. If such
   findings can be reproduced in future research, sensory perception models
   and theories positing the downstream convergence of unisensory streams
   of information in the cortex may need to be revised.}},

Title = {{Energy-Oriented Partial Desktop Virtual Machine Migration}},
Journal = {{ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2015}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Modern offices are crowded with personal computers. While studies have
   shown these to be idle most of the time, they remain powered, consuming
   up to 60\% of their peak power. Hardware-based solutions engendered by
   PC vendors (e.g., low-power states, Wake-on-LAN) have proved
   unsuccessful because, in spite of user inactivity, these machines often
   need to remain network active in support of background applications that
   maintain network presence. Recent proposals have advocated the use of
   consolidation of idle desktop Virtual Machines (VMs). However, desktop
   VMs are often large, requiring gigabytes of memory. Consolidating such
   VMs creates large network transfers lasting in the order of minutes and
   utilizes server memory inefficiently. When multiple VMs migrate
   concurrently, networks become congested, and the resulting migration
   latencies are prohibitive. We present partial VM migration, an approach
   that transparently migrates only the working set of an idle VM. It
   creates a partial replica of the desktop VM on the consolidation server
   by copying only VM metadata, and it transfers pages to the server
   on-demand, as the VM accesses them. This approach places desktop PCs in
   low-power mode when inactive and switches them to running mode when
   pages are needed by the VM running on the consolidation server. To
   ensure that desktops save energy, we have developed sleep scheduling and
   prefetching algorithms, as well as the context-aware selective resume
   framework, a novel approach to reduce the latency of power mode
   transition operations in commodity PCs. Jettison, our software prototype
   of partial VM migration for off-the-shelf PCs, can deliver 44-91\%
   energy savings during idle periods of at least 10 minutes, while
   providing low migration latencies of about 4 seconds and migrating
   minimal state that is under an order of magnitude of the VM's memory
   footprint.}},

Title = {{Mapping the coherence of ictal high frequency oscillations in human

Journal = {{EPILEPSIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{56}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{393-402}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Objective: High frequency oscillations (HFOs) have recently been
   recorded in epilepsy patients and proposed as possible novel biomarkers
   of epileptogenicity. Investigation of additional HFO characteristics
   that correlate with the clinical manifestation of seizures may yield
   additional insights for delineating epileptogenic regions. To that end,
   this study examined the spatiotemporal coherence patterns of HFOs
   (80-400 Hz) so as to characterize the strength of HFO interactions in
   the epileptic brain. We hypothesized that regions of strong HFO
   coherence identified epileptogenic networks believed to possess a
   pathologic locking nature in relation to regular brain activity.
   Methods: We applied wavelet phase coherence analysis to the intracranial
   EEG (iEEG)s of patients (n = 5) undergoing presurgical evaluation of
   drug-resistant extratemporal lobe epilepsy (ETLE). We have also computed
   HFO intensity (related to the square-root of the power), to study the
   relationship between HFO amplitude and coherence.
   Results: Strong HFO (80-270 Hz) coherence was observed in a consistent
   and spatially focused channel cluster during seizures in four of five
   patients. Furthermore, cortical regions possessing strong ictal HFO
   coherence coincided with regions exhibiting high ictal HFO intensity,
   relative to all other channels.
   Significance: Because HFOs have been shown to localize to the
   epileptogenic zone, and we have demonstrated a correlation between ictal
   HFO intensity and coherence, we propose that ictal HFO coherence can act
   as an epilepsy biomarker. Moreover, the seizures studied here showed
   strong spatial correlation of ictal HFO coherence and intensity in the
   80-270 Hz frequency range, suggesting that this band may be targeted
   when defining seizure-related regions of interest for characterizing
   ETLE.}},

Abstract = {{We analyze the uplink of coordinated multi-point (CoMP) networks in
   which cooperation can be amongst N = 2 or N = 3 base stations (BSs). We
   consider a 2-D network of BSs on a regular hexagonal lattice wherein the
   cooperation tessellates the 2-D plane into cooperation regions (CRs);
   specifically, we analyze the impact of the interference between the CRs
   in the network. Our model accounts realistic propagation conditions,
   particularly including shadowing. We obtain accurate, closed-form,
   approximations for the user capacity coverage probability (CCP) and the
   ergodic capacity at each point within the CR. To provide a network-level
   analysis, we focus on the locations within each CR with the minimum
   CCP-{''}the worst-case point(s){''}. The worst-case CCP and/or ergodic
   capacity can be used in parametric studies for network design. Here, the
   analysis is applied to obtain the relationship between cell size and CCP
   and, thereby, the required density of BSs to achieve a chosen target
   capacity coverage. The analysis also allows for a comparison between
   different orders of BS cooperation, quantifying the reduced required BS
   density from higher orders of cooperation. Comprehensive simulations are
   used to illustrate the accuracy of our analysis, including the
   approximations used for analytic tractability.}},

Abstract = {{Transmitarrays and transmissive metasurfaces must efficiently couple
   incident power to the transmitted beam. Inefficiency is manifested in
   sidelobe levels, reflections, and insertion loss. The Huygens
   metasurface embodies the Huygens and equivalence principles, suppressing
   these sidelobe levels and reflections. This is accomplished with a
   single thin layer of Huygens sources, which contains both an electric
   and a magnetic response. In this paper, 2-D interfacial refraction is
   implemented with a scalar Huygens metasurface. The measured total
   efficiency is on average 71.06\% for a 70 degrees range, the maximum
   being 80.87\% at theta(i) = 0 degrees. Moreover, it is on average
   68.64\% over a fractional bandwidth of 8\%, the maximum being 80.87\% at
   10.0 GHz. This demonstrates that the insertion loss, reflection, and
   sidelobe powers are low in our design. Furthermore, the questions of
   polarization purity, and the appropriate polarization definition for a
   scalar Huygens metasurface, are addressed. Our design contains only
   printed elements, and consists of two bonded boards, instead of many
   stacked interspaced layers. This simplifies fabrication, and makes it
   scalable to millimeter-wave frequencies and beyond. The design is also
   lambda/9.3 thick, in contrast to traditional transmitarrays, which
   require 3-4 lambda/4 spaced layers to obtain the same degree of phase
   control and matching.}},

Abstract = {{Growth and thermal behavior of copper-phthalocyanine (CuPc) and
   fullerene (C-60) organic nanocomposite thin films, grown on SiO2 and
   Cu(111) surfaces, have been studied using scanning electron microscopy,
   X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). It is
   found that the growth of pure CuPc organic thin films follows an
   island-type growth mode. The island formation is found to be
   dramatically suppressed by the inclusion of C-60 during deposition. XRD
   and STM studies reveal that the CuPc molecular packing is altered upon
   C-60 inclusion, producing disordered CuPc-C-60 interfaces. The ordered
   molecular stacking of CuPc is found to be disrupted completely when C-60
   concentration reaches 30wt.\%. The thermal stability of the CuPc thin
   film has been significantly improved upon C-60 inclusion. It is
   suggested that the molecular diffusion kinetics rather than
   thermodynamics are responsible for the improved stability.}},

Title = {{The Computational Fluid Dynamics Rupture Challenge 2013-Phase I:
   Prediction of Rupture Status in Intracranial Aneurysms}},
Journal = {{AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{36}},

Pages = {{530-536}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Rupture risk assessment for intracranial
   aneurysms remains challenging, and risk factors, including wall shear
   stress, are discussed controversially. The primary purpose of the
   presented challenge was to determine how consistently aneurysm rupture
   status and rupture site could be identified on the basis of
   computational fluid dynamics.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two geometrically similar MCA aneurysms were
   selected, 1 ruptured, 1 unruptured. Participating computational fluid
   dynamics groups were blinded as to which case was ruptured. Participants
   were provided with digitally segmented lumen geometries and, for this
   phase of the challenge, were free to choose their own flow rates, blood
   rheologies, and so forth. Participants were asked to report which case
   had ruptured and the likely site of rupture. In parallel, lumen
   geometries were provided to a group of neurosurgeons for their
   predictions of rupture status and site.
   RESULTS: Of 26 participating computational fluid dynamics groups, 21
   (81\%) correctly identified the ruptured case. Although the known
   rupture site was associated with low and oscillatory wall shear stress,
   most groups identified other sites, some of which also experienced low
   and oscillatory shear. Of the 43 participating neurosurgeons, 39 (91\%)
   identified the ruptured case. None correctly identified the rupture
   site.
   CONCLUSIONS: Geometric or hemodynamic considerations favor
   identification of rupture status; however, retrospective identification
   of the rupture site remains a challenge for both engineers and
   clinicians. A more precise understanding of the hemodynamic factors
   involved in aneurysm wall pathology is likely required for computational
   fluid dynamics to add value to current clinical decision-making
   regarding rupture risk.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of xylan is a detriment to the enzymatic saccharification
   of cellulose in lignocelluloses. The inhibition of the processive
   cellobiohydrolase Cel7A by soluble wheat arabinoxylan is shown here to
   increase by 50 \% following enzymatic treatment with a
   commercially-purified alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase. The enhanced
   inhibitory effect was shown by T-2 relaxation time measurements via low
   field NMR to coincide with an increasing degree of constraint put on the
   water in xylan solutions. Furthermore, quartz crystal micro-balance with
   dissipation experiments showed that alpha-l-arabinofuranosidase
   treatment considerably increased the rate and rigidity of arabinoxylan
   mass association with cellulose. These data also suggest significant
   xylan-xylan adlayer formation occurs following initial binding of
   debranched arabinoxylan. From this, we speculate the inhibitory effects
   of xylan to cellulases may result from reduced enzymatic access via the
   dense association of xylan with cellulose.}},

Volume = {{62}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a novel low-complexity multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) detector tailored for single-carrier frequency
   division-multiple access (SC-FDMA) systems, suitable for efficient
   hardware implementations. The proposed detector starts with an initial
   estimate of the transmitted signal based on a minimum mean square error
   (MMSE) detector. Subsequently, it recognizes less reliable symbols for
   which more candidates in the constellation are browsed to improve the
   initial estimate. An efficient high-throughput VLSI architecture is also
   introduced achieving a superior performance compared to the conventional
   MMSE detectors with less than 28\% added complexity. The performance of
   the proposed design is close to the existing maximum likelihood
   post-detection processing (ML-PDP) scheme, while resulting in a
   significantly lower complexity, i.e., 4.5 x 10(2) and 7 x 10(4) times
   fewer Euclidean distance (ED) calculations in the 16-QAM and 64-QAM
   schemes, respectively. The proposed design for the 16-QAM scheme is
   fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology and fully tested, achieving a
   1.332 Gbps throughput, reporting the first fabricated design for SC-FDMA
   MIMO detectors to-date. A soft version of the proposed architecture is
   also introduced, which is customized for coded systems.}},

Abstract = {{Cell metabolism is an important platform for sustainable biofuel,
   chemical and pharmaceutical production but its complexity presents a
   major challenge for scientists and engineers. Although in silica strains
   have been designed in the past with predicted performances near the
   theoretical maximum, real-world performance is often sub-optimal. Here,
   we simulate how strain performance is impacted when subjected to many
   randomly varying perturbations, including discrepancies between gene
   expression and in vivo flux, osmotic stress, and substrate uptake
   perturbations due to concentration gradients in bioreactors. This
   computational study asks whether robust performance can be achieved by
   adopting robustness-enhancing mechanisms from naturally evolved
   organisms-in particular, redundancy. Our study shows that redundancy,
   typically perceived as a ubiquitous robustness-enhancing strategy in
   nature, can either improve or undermine robustness depending on the
   magnitude of the perturbations. We also show that the optimal number of
   redundant pathways used can be predicted for a given perturbation size.

Abstract = {{Volume diffractive optical elements promise widespread application in
   laser beam shaping, imaging and optical data storage by structuring
   refractive index modulation in the third axial dimension. Femtosecond
   laser direct writing has been exploited inside fused silica to assemble
   multiple 1D grating layers on Talbot planes and overcome the inherent
   weak diffraction efficiency otherwise found in low-contrast volume
   gratings. Here, we extend laser structuring from linear (1D) to
   orthogonally crossed (2D) gratings with the aim to write 3D photonic
   crystal templates in photoresist by 3D interference lithography. The
   formation of crossed grating structures present challenges in balancing
   the efficiency of diffraction orders owing to blazing and index
   overwriting effects requiring compensation by tuning the grating design
   and laser power exposure. In this way, six-layer grating designs have
   been fabricated and applied to exposure of thick photoresist, enabling
   the formation of 3D photonic crystal templates with bicontinuous
   structure. A systematic offsetting of orthogonal grating layers to
   establish phase offsets over 0 to pi/2 range presents a precise means
   for controlling the photonic crystal structure symmetry between body
   centered tetragonal (BCT) and woodpilelike tetragonal (wTTR). (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Natural organic matter (NOM) in drinking water can react with
   disinfectants to form disinfection by-products (DBPs). Halogenated
   furanones are a group of emerging DBPs that can account for 20-60\% of
   the total mutagenicity observed in drinking water. This study examined
   the impacts of bench-scale coagulation and subsequent chlorination on
   DBP formation as well as genotoxicity using three source waters located
   in Ontario, Canada. Two halogenated furanones
   3-chloro-4-(dichloromethyl)-2(5H)-furanone (MX) and mucochloric acid
   (MCA) were analyzed; along with trihalomethanes (THMs), haloacetic acids
   (HAAs), and absorbable organic halides (AOX). NOM was quantified using
   liquid chromatography-organic carbon detection (LC-OCD). Measured MX and
   MCA formation was 6.9-15.3 ng/L and 43.2-315 ng/L following optimized
   coagulation and subsequent chlorination of the three waters tested. DBP
   formation and speciation were evaluated as a function of the specific
   NOM fractions present in the source waters. Humics, building blocks, and
   biopolymers were highly correlated with DBP formation. Correlations
   between DBPs were also investigated and a potential relationship between
   MCA and/or MX vs. HAAs was observed. MX was the only measured DBP that
   contributed to genotoxicity, representing less than 0.001\% of AOX by
   mass but responsible for 40-67\% of the genotoxic response in
   chlorinated Ottawa River water samples. Genotoxic potential decreased
   with alum dosages, signifying that coagulation was effective at removing
   genotoxic DBP precursors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The shrimp Rimicaris exoculata dominates the fauna in deep-sea
   hydrothermal vent sites along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (depth, 2,320 m).
   Here, we identified and biochemically characterized three carboxyl
   esterases from microbial communities inhabiting the R. exoculata gill
   that were isolated by naive screens of a gill chamber metagenomic
   library. These proteins exhibit low to moderate identity to known
   esterase sequences (<= 52\%) and to each other (11.9 to 63.7\%) and
   appear to have originated from unknown species or from genera of
   Proteobacteria related to Thiothrix/Leucothrix (MGS-RG1/RG2) and to the
   Rhodobacteraceae group (MGS-RG3). A library of 131 esters and 31
   additional esterase/lipase preparations was used to evaluate the
   activity profiles of these enzymes. All 3 of these enzymes had greater
   esterase than lipase activity and exhibited specific activities with
   ester substrates (<= 356 U mg(-1)) in the range of similar enzymes.
   MGS-RG3 was inhibited by salts and pressure and had a low optimal
   temperature (30 degrees C), and its substrate profile clustered within a
   group of low-activity and substrate-restricted marine enzymes. In
   contrast, MGS-RG1 and MGS-RG2 were most active at 45 to 50 degrees C and
   were salt activated and barotolerant. They also exhibited wider
   substrate profiles that were close to those of highly active promiscuous
   enzymes from a marine hydrothermal vent (MGS-RG2) and from a cold
   brackish lake (MGS-RG1). The data presented are discussed in the context
   of promoting the examination of enzyme activities of taxa found in
   habitats that have been neglected for enzyme prospecting; the enzymes
   found in these taxa may reflect distinct habitat-specific adaptations
   and may constitute new sources of rare reaction specificities.}},

Abstract = {{Most of the Earth's biosphere is cold and is populated by cold-adapted
   microorganisms. To explore the natural enzyme diversity of these
   environments and identify new carboxylesterases, we have screened three
   marine metagenome gene libraries for esterase activity. The screens
   identified 23 unique active clones, from which five highly active
   esterases were selected for biochemical characterization. The purified
   metagenomic esterases exhibited high activity against alpha-naphthyl and
   p-nitrophenyl esters with different chain lengths. All five esterases
   retained high activity at 5 A degrees C indicating that they are
   cold-adapted enzymes. The activity of MGS0010 increased more than two
   times in the presence of up to 3.5 M NaCl or KCl, whereas the other four
   metagenomic esterases were inhibited to various degrees by these salts.
   The purified enzymes showed different sensitivities to inhibition by
   solvents and detergents, and the activities of MGS0010, MGS0105 and
   MGS0109 were stimulated three to five times by the addition of glycerol.
   Screening of purified esterases against 89 monoester substrates revealed
   broad substrate profiles with a preference for different esters. The
   metagenomic esterases also hydrolyzed several polyester substrates
   including polylactic acid suggesting that they can be used for polyester
   depolymerization. Thus, esterases from marine metagenomes are
   cold-adapted enzymes exhibiting broad biochemical diversity reflecting
   the environmental conditions where they evolved.}},

Abstract = {{We identify a new observability concept, called relative observability,
   in supervisory control of discrete-event systems under partial
   observation. A fixed, ambient language is given, relative to which
   observability is tested. Relative observability is stronger than
   observability, but enjoys the important property that it is preserved
   under set union; hence there exists the supremal relatively observable
   sublanguage of a given language. Relative observability is weaker than
   normality, and thus yields, when combined with controllability, a
   generally larger controlled behavior; in particular, no constraint is
   imposed that only observable controllable events may be disabled. We
   design new algorithms which compute the supremal relatively observable
   (and controllable) sublanguage of a given language, which is generally
   larger than the normal counterpart. We demonstrate the new observability
   concept and algorithms with a Guideway and an AGV example.}},

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second leading neurodegenerative disease
   after Alzheimer's disease. In PD research and its surgical treatment,
   such as deep brain stimulation (DBS), anatomical structural
   identification and references for spatial normalization are essential,
   and human brain atlases/templates are proven highly instrumental.
   However, two shortcomings affect current templates used for PD. First,
   many templates are derived from a single healthy subject that is not
   sufficiently representative of the PD-population anatomy. This may
   result in suboptimal surgical plans for DBS surgery and biased analysis
   for morphological studies. Second, commonly used mono-contrast templates
   lack sufficient image contrast for some subcortical structures (i.e.,
   subthalamic nucleus) and biochemical information (i.e., iron content), a
   valuable feature in current PD research.
   We employed a novel T1-T2{*} fusion MRI that visualizes both cortical
   and subcortical structures to drive groupwise registration to create
   co-registered multi-contrast (T1w, T2{*}w, T1-T2{*} fusion, phase, and
   an R2{*} map) unbiased templates from 15 PD patients, and a
   high-resolution histology-derived 3D atlas is co-registered. For
   validation, these templates are compared against the Colin27 template
   for landmark registration and midbrain nuclei segmentation.
   While the T1w, T2{*}w, and T1-T2{*} fusion templates provide excellent
   anatomical details for both cortical and subcortical structures, the
   phase and R2{*} map contain the biochemical features. By one-way ANOVA
   tests, our templates significantly () outperform the Colin27 template in
   the registration-based tasks.
   The proposed unbiased templates are more representative of the
   population of interest and can benefit both the surgical planning and
   research of PD.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes the application of a non-sinusoidal periodic
   excitation voltage to induce a near-square-wave driving tip trajectory
   in linear ultrasonic motors (LUSMs). A square-wave-based trajectory can
   deliver superior frictional force to the moving stage in the forward
   stroke of the driving tip motion and reduced frictional force during the
   return stroke. This would reduce lost power in the periodic driving tip
   motion, thereby, increasing the output force and power of the LUSM. An
   implementation procedure is suggested to achieve the near-square-wave
   driving tip trajectory. The proposed approach is illustrated through
   realistic finite-element-based simulations using a bimodal LUSM
   configuration.}},

Journal = {{ACTA MATERIALIA}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{86}},
Pages = {{157-168}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Lattice materials composed of hollow nanocrystalline struts have
   recently made it possible to access new regions of material property
   space, by exploiting structural efficiencies along multiple length
   scales (nanometre to centimetre range). An important design issue for
   these materials is to understand how the failure mechanisms that act at
   these scales affect the macroscopic mechanical properties. In this
   study, we tested hollow nanocrystalline cylinders of two different grain
   sizes (20 nm and 100 nm) in uniaxial compression to investigate the
   effect of grain size on dominant failure mechanisms, and the influence
   of the latter on the compressive strength. The finite element method was
   used to model the interaction of the three observed failure mechanisms:
   shell buckling (SB), yielding (Y) and fracture (F). Depending on the
   grain size and geometry, the failure sequence can be SB-Y-F, Y-SB-F,
   SB-Y or Y-SB, the order of which has important implications in defining
   the limits of mechanical performance. One such implication is that when
   shell buckling occurs in the inelastic regime of the material, the
   macroscopic strength increase due to grain size refinement can be
   greater than the inherent yield strength increase of the material.
   Second, material fracture and shell buckling may not be competing
   failure mechanisms, which means that the effectiveness of grain size
   reduction in increasing the structural efficiency of cylindrical strut
   members can span the entire Hall-Petch range of the material. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{PurposeTo investigate the potential of manganese (Mn)-enhanced MRI for
   sensitive detection and delineation of tumors that demonstrate little
   enhancement on Gd-DTPA.
   Materials and MethodsEighteen nude rats bearing 1 to 2 cm in diameter
   orthotopic breast tumors (ZR75 and LM2) were imaged on a 3 Tesla (T)
   clinical scanner. Gd-DTPA was administered intravenously and MnCl2
   subcutaneously, both at 0.05 mmol/kg. T-1-weighted imaging and T-1
   measurements were performed precontrast, 10 min post-Gd-DTPA, and 24 h
   post-MnCl2. Tumors were excised and histologically assessed using H\&E
   (composition and necrosis) and CD34 (vascularity).
   ResultsMost tumors (78\%) demonstrated little enhancement (< 20\% change
   in R-1) on Gd-DTPA. MnCl2 administration achieved greater and more
   uniform enhancement throughout the tumor mass (i.e., not restricted to
   the tumor periphery), with R-1 changing over 20\% in 72\% of tumors.
   MnCl2-induced R-1 changes compared with Gd-induced changes were
   significantly greater in both ZR75 (P<0.01) and LM2 tumors (P<0.05).
   Histology confirmed very low vascularity in both tumor models, and
   necrotic areas were well delineated only on Mn-enhanced MRI.
   ConclusionMn-enhanced MRI is a promising approach for detection of
   low-Gd-enhancing tumors. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:806-813. (c)

Abstract = {{In this paper, a hybrid configuration of ant colony optimization (ACO)
   with artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm called hybrid ACO-ABC
   algorithm is presented for optimal location and sizing of distributed
   energy resources (DERs) (i.e., gas turbine, fuel cell, and wind energy)
   on distribution systems. The proposed algorithm is a combined strategy
   based on the discrete (location optimization) and continuous (size
   optimization) structures to achieve advantages of the global and local
   search ability of ABC and ACO algorithms, respectively. Also, in the
   proposed algorithm, a multi-objective ABC is used to produce a set of
   non-dominated solutions which store in the external archive. The
   objectives consist of minimizing power losses, total emissions produced
   by substation and resources, total electrical energy cost, and improving
   the voltage stability. In order to investigate the impact of the
   uncertainty in the output of the wind energy and load demands, a
   probabilistic load flow is necessary. In this study, an efficient point
   estimate method (PEM) is employed to solve the optimization problem in a
   stochastic environment. The proposed algorithm is tested on the IEEE 33-
   and 69-bus distribution systems. The results demonstrate the potential
   and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in comparison with those of
   other evolutionary optimization methods. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Short and long packets co-exist in cache-coherent NoCs. Existing designs
   for torus networks do not efficiently handle variable-size packets. For
   deadlock free operations, a design uses two VCs, which negatively
   affects the router frequency. Some optimizations use one VC. Yet, they
   regard all packets as maximum-length packets, inefficiently utilizing
   the precious buffers. We propose flit bubble flow control (FBFC), which
   maintains one free flit-size buffer slot to avoid deadlock. FBFC uses
   one VC, and does not treat short packets as long ones. It achieves both
   high frequency and efficient buffer utilization. FBFC performs 92.8 and
   34.2 percent better than LBS and CBS for synthetic traffic in a 4 x 4
   torus. The gains increase in larger networks; they are 107.2 and 40.1
   percent in an 8 x 8 torus. FBFC achieves an average 13.0 percent speedup
   over LBS for PARSEC workloads. Our results also show that FBFC is more
   power efficient than LBS and CBS, and a torus with FBFC is more power
   efficient than a mesh.}},

Volume = {{767}},
Pages = {{146-172}},

Abstract = {{We investigate azimuthal instabilities which exist on the periphery of a
   non-turbulent liquid jet injected transversely into a gaseous
   cross-flow. We predict that the temporal growth of such instabilities
   may lead to the formation of interface corrugations, which are
   eventually sheared off of the jet surface (known as the jet `surface
   breakup'), In this study we employ temporal linear stability analyses to
   understand the nature of these instabilities. The analysis is based on a
   continuous formulation of momentum equations in which the jet and cross
   floss are considered to be slightly miscible at the vicinity of the
   interface. We identify the shear instability as the primary
   destabilization mechanism in the flow. This inherently inviscid
   mechanism opposes the previously suggested mechanism of surface breakup
   (known as `boundary-layer stripping'), which is based on a viscous
   interpretation. The results show that the wavelengths of instabilities
   increase by moving away from the jet windward stagnation point toward
   the leeward point. We also investigate the influence of the
   jet-to-cross-flow density ratio on the flow stability and find that a
   higher ratio leads to formation of instabilities with higher wavenumbers
   on the jet surface. The results show that the density may have a
   non-monotonic stabilizing/destabilizing effect on the flow.}},

Abstract = {{In the first of a two part publication, the effect of fuel utilization
   (U-f) on carbon deposition rates in solid oxide fuel cell nickel-based
   anodes was studied. Representative 5-component CH4 reformate
   compositions (CH4, H-2, CO, H2O, \& CO2) were selected graphically by
   plotting the solutions to a system of mass-balance constraint equations.
   The centroid of the solution space was chosen to represent a typical
   anode gas mixture for each nominal Uf value. Selected 5-component and
   3-component gas mixtures were then delivered to anode-supported cells
   for 10 h, followed by determination of the resulting deposited carbon
   mass. The empirical carbon deposition thresholds were affected by atomic
   carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (0) fractions of the delivered gas
   mixtures and temperature. It was also found that CH4-rich gas mixtures
   caused irreversible damage, whereas atomically equivalent CO-rich
   compositions did not. The coking threshold predicted by thermodynamic
   equilibrium calculations employing graphite for the solid carbon phase
   agreed well with empirical thresholds at 700 degrees C (Uf approximate
   to 32\%); however, at 600 degrees C, poor agreement was observed with
   the empirical threshold of 36\%. Finally, cell operating temperatures
   correlated well with the difference in enthalpy between the supplied
   anode gas mixtures and their resulting thermodynamic equilibrium gas
   mixtures. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{For the second part of a two part publication, coking thresholds with
   respect to molar steam:carbon ratio (SC) and current density in
   nickel-based solid oxide fuel cells were determined. Anode-supported
   button cell samples were exposed to 2-component and 5-component gas
   mixtures with I <= SC <= 2 and zero fuel utilization for 10 h, followed
   by measurement of the resulting carbon mass. The effect of current
   density was explored by measuring carbon mass under conditions known to
   be prone to coking while increasing the current density until the cell
   was carbon-free. The SC coking thresholds were measured to be similar to
   1.04 and -1.18 at 600 and 700 degrees C, respectively. Current density
   experiments validated the thresholds measured with respect to fuel
   utilization and steam:carbon ratio. Coking thresholds at 600 degrees C
   could be predicted with thermodynamic equilibrium calculations when the
   Gibbs free energy of carbon was appropriately modified. Here, the Gibbs
   free energy of carbon on nickel-based anode support cermets was measured
   to be -6.91 +/- 0.08 kJ mol(-1). The results of this two part
   publication show that thermodynamic equilibrium calculations with
   appropriate modification to the Gibbs free energy of solid-phase carbon
   cart be used to predict coking thresholds on nickel-based anodes at
   600-700 degrees C. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This study develops a fuzzy-boundary interval programming (FBIP) method
   for tackling dual uncertainties expressed as crisp intervals and
   fuzzy-boundary intervals. An interactive algorithm and a vertex analysis
   approach are proposed for solving the FBIP model and solutions with
   alpha-cut levels have been generated. FBIP is applied to planning water
   quality management of Xiangxi River in the Three Gorges Reservoir
   Region, China. Biological oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN), and
   total phosphorus (TP) are selected as water quality indicators to
   determine the pollution control strategies. Results reveal that the
   highest discharge of BOD is observed at the Baishahe chemical plant,
   among all point and nonpoint sources; crop farming is the main nonpoint
   source with the excessive nitrogen loading due to too much uses of
   livestock manures and chemical fertilizers; phosphorus discharge derives
   mainly from point sources (i.e. chemical plants and phosphorus mining
   companies). Abatement of pollutant discharges from industrial and
   agricultural activities is critical for the river pollution control;
   however, the implementation of management practices for pollution
   control can have potentials to affect the local economic income. These
   findings can help generate desired decisions for identifying various
   industrial and agricultural activities in association with both
   maximizing economic income and mitigating river-water pollution.}},

Journal = {{PUBLIC TRANSPORT}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},

Pages = {{39-60}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Public transit agencies are constantly looking for ways to increase
   their ridership. While many studies have attempted to identify the
   factors affecting new customer attraction, the issue of transit user
   loyalty has been far less researched. In addition to being a good
   indicator of a transit agency's performance, customer loyalty provides
   several added benefits. Loyal customers are more likely to use the
   transit agency's services and recommend them to potential new users.
   Furthermore, attracting users usually involves additional customer
   acquisition costs (e.g. marketing) not required in order to retain
   existing loyal users. This study used data provided by a mixed Stated
   Preference/Revealed Preference survey to identify some of the factors
   that affect customer loyalty in the context of public transit. Factors
   examined include service attributes, trip characteristics, as well as
   socioeconomic and psychological attributes of the individual. The
   findings suggest that service quality attributes play a critical role in
   transit user loyalty, while initiatives such as the provision of
   real-time information panels or making park and ride facilities
   available have a less determinant effect on the customers' mode shifting
   decisions, irrespective of their emotional response to public transit.}},

Journal = {{ULTRASONICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{A literature survey is presented on the radiation endurance of
   piezoelectric ultrasonic transducer components and complete transducer
   assemblies, as functions of cumulative gamma dose and neutron fluence.
   The most extensive data on this topic has been acquired in CANDU
   electrical generating stations, which use piezoelectric ultrasonic
   transducers manufactured commercially with minor accommodation for high
   radiation fields. They have been found to be reliable for cumulative
   gamma doses of up to approximately 2 MegaGrays; a brief summary is made
   of the associated accommodations required to the transducer design, and
   the ultimate expected failure modes.
   Outside of the CANDU experience, endurance data have been acquired under
   a diverse spectrum of operating conditions; this can impede a direct
   comparison of the information from different sources. Much of this data
   is associated with transducers immersed in liquid metal coolants
   associated with advanced reactor designs. Significant modifications to
   conventional designs have led to the availability of custom transducers
   that can endure well over 100 MegaGrays of cumulative gamma dose.
   Published data on transducer endurance against neutron fluence are
   reviewed, but are either insufficient, or were reported with inadequate
   description of test conditions, to make general conclusions on
   transducer endurance with high confidence. Several test projects are
   planned or are already underway by major laboratories and research
   consortia to augment the store of transducer endurance data with respect
   to both gamma and neutron radiation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{558-575}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{The paper considers the problem of dynamic sensor scheduling for
   non-linear tracking problems in distributed sensor/agent networks
   (AN/SN), where channel limitations restrict how many sensors can
   simultaneously participate in the estimation mechanism. Commonly
   referred to as sensor selection, the basic objective is to select a
   subset of sensors from available sensors that minimises the estimation
   error. The posterior Cramer-Rao lower bound (PCRLB) has recently been
   proposed as an effective sensor selection criteria. Nevertheless,
   existing PCRLB-based selectors are limited to centralised and
   hierarchical networks, and when extended to distributed architectures
   use approximate expressions. First, the non-conditional distributed
   PCRLB (dPCRLB) that considers observations and state variables to be
   random is used to derive the non-conditional sensor-selector. The dPCRLB
   expressions we derive are optimal. Unlike the non-conditional PCRLB, its
   conditional counterpart is a function of the past history of
   observations and is a more accurate representation of the system's
   performance. Second, the paper generalises the non-conditional dPCRLB
   sensor-selector to its conditional dPCRLB version. Both dPCRLB
   sensor-selectors use raw observations adding significant communication
   overhead. Third, the paper extends the conditional dPCRLB framework to
   quantised observations and develops the quantised version of the
   conditional dPCRLB sensor-selector. Numerical simulations verify the
   efficiency of our distributed dynamic sensor-selectors. (C) 2014

   tracking using an acoustic vector sensor network}},
Journal = {{SIGNAL PROCESSING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{108}},
Pages = {{589-603}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Different centralized approaches such as least-squares (LS) and particle
   filtering (PF) algorithms have been developed to localize an acoustic
   source by using a distributed acoustic vector sensor (AVS) array.
   However, such algorithms are either not applicable for multiple sources
   or rely heavily on sensor-processor communication. In this paper, a
   distributed unscented PF (DUPF) approach is proposed for multiple
   acoustic source tracking. At each distributed AVS node, the first-order
   and the second-order statistics of the local state are estimated by
   using an unscented information filter (UIF) based PF. The UIF is
   employed to approximate the optimum importance function due to its
   simplicity, by which the matrix operation is the state information
   matrix rather than the covariance matrix of the measurement sequence.
   These local statistics are then fused between neighbor nodes and a
   consensus filter is applied to achieve a global estimation. In such an
   architecture, only the state statistics need to be transmitted among the
   neighbor nodes. Consequently, the communication cost can be reduced. The
   distributed posterior Cramer-Rao bound is also derived. Simulation
   results show that the performance of the DUPF tracking approach is
   similar to that of centralized PF algorithm and significantly better
   than that of LS algorithms. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Spatial control of the conductivity of
   poly(3,4-ethylenediophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is
   demonstrated through the Use of ultraviolet (UV) exposure. With
   appropriate UV exposure, electrical characterization shows that the
   in-plane sheet resistance of PEDOT:PSS films is increased by 4 orders of
   magnitude compared to unexposed regions. Characterization Of the films
   using Raman Spectroscopy identifies a significant reduction of the
   inter-ring stretching modes between PEDOT monomers and a morphological
   shift from the quinoid to benzoid form of PEDOT. Additional analysis
   using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy indicates a reduction in
   filth doping and a decrease in C=C vibrational modes that are associated
   with PEDOT oligomer length. Height and phase images of these,films
   obtained from atomic force microscopy exhibit a loss Of phase
   segregation in the film between the PEDOT grains and PSS regions:
   Spectroscopic ellipsometry highlights an increase in both the real and
   imaginary components of the Index upon UV explosure. This broad range of
   analysis consistently suggests that the increased resistivity can be
   attributed to a significant reduction in material doping caused by
   scission-driven decomposition of the Conductive PEDOT chains When flood
   exposure is combined with the use of an appropriate UV blocking mask,
   patterning in the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS films can be realized. In
   contrast to other patterning approaches, no resist development or
   etching is required for the electrical isolation of certain regions. TO
   demonstrate the efficacy of this process, an organic light emitting
   diode was fabricated with UV patterned PEDOT:PSS as a hole transport
   layer. The regions of unexposed PEDOT:PSS produced electrolurninescence,
   whereas those exposed to UV remained unlit, enabling the realization of
   pixelated illumination with no removal of material.}},

   Tetrahedral-mesh-based MC simulations particularly are attractive due to
   the ability to refine the mesh at will to conform to complicated
   geometries or user-defined resolution requirements. Since the chosen MC
   method does not inherently require approximations on the materials, it
   is applicable to the broadest set of biophotonic simulation problems. MC
   methods also have other implementation features including inherent
   parallelism, and permit a continuously-variable quality-runtime
   tradeoff. We demonstrate here a complete MC-based prospective fluence
   dose evaluation system for interstitial PDT to generate dose-volume
   histograms on a tetrahedral mesh geometry description. To our knowledge,
   this is the first such system for general interstitial photodynamic
   therapy employing MC methods and is therefore applicable to a very broad
   cross-section of anatomy and material properties. We demonstrate that
   evaluation of dose-volume histograms is an effective variance-reduction
   scheme in its own right which greatly reduces the number of packets
   required and hence runtime required to achieve acceptable result
   confidence. We conclude that MC methods are feasible for general PDT
   treatment evaluation and planning, and considerably less costly than
   widely believed.}},

Title = {{Control of zinc oxide nanowire array properties with electron-beam
   lithography templating for photovoltaic applications}},
Journal = {{NANOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Hydrothermally synthesized zinc oxide nanowire arrays have been used as
   nanostructured acceptors in emerging photovoltaic (PV) devices. The
   nanoscale dimensions of such arrays allow for enhanced charge extraction
   from PV active layers, but the device performance critically depends on
   the nanowire array pitch and alignment. In this study, we templated
   hydrothermally-grown ZnO nanowire arrays via high-resolution
   electron-beam-lithography defined masks, achieving the dual requirements
   of high-resolution patterning at a pitch of several hundred nanometers,
   while maintaining hole sizes small enough to control nanowire array
   morphology. We investigated several process conditions, including the
   effect of annealing sputtered and spincoated ZnO seed layers on nanowire
   growth, to optimize array property metrics-branching from individual
   template holes and off-normal alignment. We found that decreasing
   template hole size decreased branching prevalence but also reduced
   alignment. Annealing seed layers typically improved alignment, and
   sputtered seed layers yielded nanowire arrays superior to spincoated
   seed layers. We show that these effects arose from variation in the size
   of the template holes relative to the ZnO grain size in the seed layer.
   The quantitative control of branching and alignment of the nanowire
   array that is achieved in this study will open new paths toward
   engineering more efficient electrodes to increase photocurrent in
   nanostructured PVs. This control is also applicable to inorganic
   nanowire growth in general, nanomechanical generators, nanowire
   transistors, and surface-energy engineering.}},

Title = {{TRPM7 inhibitor carvacrol protects brain from neonatal hypoxic-ischemic
   injury}},
Journal = {{MOLECULAR BRAIN}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{FEB 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Our previous study found that suppression of TRPM7 reduced
   neuronal death in adult rat ischemic brain injury. It was reported that
   carvacrol blocked TRPM7 and attenuated brain injury in an adult rat MCAO
   model. The effects of carvacrol on neonatal stroke remain unknown. This
   study investigated the effects of carvacrol on neuronal injury and
   behavioral impairment after hypoxia-ischemia in neonatal mice and the
   potential signaling pathway underlying these effects.
   Results: Carvacrol inhibited TRPM7 current in HEK293 cells
   over-expressing TRPM7 and TRPM7-like current in hippocampal neurons in a
   dose-dependent manner. Carvacrol (> 200 mu M) reduced OGD-induced
   neuronal injury in cortical neurons. 24 hours after HI, TRPM7 protein
   level in the ipsilateral hemisphere was significantly higher than in the
   contralateral hemisphere. Carvacrol (30 and 50 mg/kg) pre-treatment
   reduced brain infarct volume 24 hours after HI in a dose-dependent
   manner. Carvacrol pre-treatment also improved neurobehavioral outcomes.
   Furthermore, animals pre-treated with carvacrol had fewer TUNEL-positive
   cells in the brain compared to vehicle-treated animals 3 days after HI.
   Carvacrol pre-treatment also increased Bcl-2/Bax and p-Akt/t-Akt protein
   ratios and decreased cleaved caspase-3 protein expression 24 hours after
   HI.
   Conclusions: Carvacrol pre-treatment protects against neonatal
   hypoxic-ischemic brain injury by reducing brain infarct volume,
   promoting pro-survival signaling and inhibiting pro-apoptotic signaling,
   as well as improving behavioral outcomes. The neuroprotective effect may
   be mediated by the inhibition of TRPM7 channel function. Carvacrol is a
   potential drug development target for the treatment of neonatal stroke.}},

Abstract = {{Although posterior tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) has been shown in
   both clinical and animal studies to elicit bladder-inhibitory reflexes,
   our understanding of the role of posterior tibial nerve (PTN) afferents
   that elicit these responses is significantly limited. To this end, we
   investigated the effects of frequency-dependant PTNS in
   urethane-anesthetized rats undergoing repeated urodynamic fills. Nerve
   stimulation trials (10 min) resulted in statistically significant
   inhibition of the urinary bladder, both during and after nerve
   stimulation (P < 0.05). PTNS applied at 5 Hz resulted in both acute and
   prolonged changes that corresponded to 38.0\% and 34.1\% reductions in
   the bladder contraction frequency, respectively. In contrast, PTNS
   applied at 10 Hz could only elicit an acute decrease (22.9\%) in bladder
   activity. Subsequent electrical activation of individual PTN branches
   (lateral or medial plantar nerves) confirmed that these bladder reflexes
   are mediated by specific subsets of the PTN trunk. Both acute and
   prolonged inhibition of the bladder were achieved by electrical
   stimulation of the lateral plantar (10 and 20 Hz) and medial plantar (5
   and 10 Hz) nerves. Finally, we report a bladder-excitatory reflex that
   is elicited by electrical activation of either the PTN trunk or lateral
   plantar nerve at 50 Hz. This study shows that multiple bladder reflexes
   are tuned to specific subsets of nerve afferents and stimulation
   frequencies, each of which provide novel insights into the physiological
   effects of PTNS.}},

Abstract = {{Polylactide (PLA) composite foams with two different void fractions of
   30\% and 55\% were developed using regular foam injection molding (FIM)

   kinetics of the unfoamed samples was also analyzed with and without the
   presence of dissolved nitrogen (N-2). The results showed that the
   presence of nanoclay and talc, presence of pressurized N-2, foaming
   action, and mold opening all enhanced the PLA's crystallization kinetics
   during injection molding, leading to a threefold increase in the final
   crystallinity. Consequently, the presence of nanoclay/talc together with
   the expedited crystallization enhanced the PLA foams' morphology with a
   finer and more uniform cell structure (cell size < 50 mu m) at a void
   fraction of 55\%. The mechanisms of the formation of such morphologies

Abstract = {{Tumors often contain multiple subpopulations of cancerous cells defined

   on variant allele frequencies (VAFs) of point mutations and population
   frequencies of structural variations. We introduce a principled

Title = {{Superoscillations without Sidebands: Power-Efficient Sub-Diffraction
   Imaging with Propagating Waves}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{A superoscillation wave is a special superposition of propagating
   electromagnetic (EM) waves which varies with sub-diffraction resolution
   inside a fixed region. This special property allows superoscillation
   waves to carry sub-diffraction details of an object into the far-field,
   and makes it an attractive candidate technology for super-resolution
   devices. However, the Shannon limit seemingly requires that
   superoscillations must exist alongside high-energy sidebands, which can
   impede its widespread application. In this work we show that, contrary
   to prior understanding, one can selectively synthesize a portion of a
   superoscillation wave and thereby remove its high-energy region.
   Moreover, we show that by removing the high-energy region of a
   superoscillation wave-based imaging device, one can increase its power
   efficiency by two orders of magnitude. We describe the concept behind
   this development, elucidate conditions under which this phenomenon
   occurs, then report fullwave simulations which demonstrate the
   successful, power-efficient generation of sub-wavelength focal spots
   from propagating waves.}},

Abstract = {{Colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs) are widely studied as
   building blocks for novel solid-state materials. Inorganic surface
   functionalization, used to displace native organic capping ligands from
   NC surfaces, has been a major enabler of electronic solid-state devices
   based on colloidal NCs. At the same time, very little is known about the
   atomistic details of the organic-to-inorganic ligand exchange and
   binding motifs at the NC surface, severely limiting further progress in
   designing all-inorganic NCs and NC solids. Taking thiostannates (K4SnS4,
   K4Sn2S6, K6Sn2S7) as typical examples of chalcogenidometallate ligands
   and oleate-capped CdSe NCs as a model NC system, in this study we
   address these questions through the combined application of solution H-1
   NMR spectroscopy, solution and solid-state 119Sn NMR spectroscopy,
   far-infrared and X-ray absorption spectroscopies, elemental analysis,
   and by DFT modeling. We show that through the X-type
   oleate-to-thiostannate ligand exchange, CdSe NCs retain their Cd-rich
   stoichiometry, with a stoichiometric CdSe core and surface Cd adatoms
   serving as binding sites for terminal S atoms of the thiostannates
   ligands, leading to all-inorganic
   (CdSe)(core){[}Cdm(Sn2S7)(y)K((6y-2m))]shell (taking Sn2S76 ligand as an
   example). Thiostannates SnS44 and Sn2S76- retain (distorted) tetrahedral
   SnS4 geometry upon binding to NC surface. At the same time, experiments
   and simulations point to lower stability of Sn2S64 (and SnS32) in most
   solvents and its lower adaptability to the NC surface caused by rigid
   Sn2S2 rings.}},

Journal = {{APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS}},

Month = {{FEB 9}},
Abstract = {{Hydrophobic surfaces that are robust can have widespread applications in
   drop-wise condensation, anti-corrosion, and anti-icing. Recently, it was
   shown that the class of ceramics comprising the lanthanide series
   rare-earth oxides (REOs) is intrinsically hydrophobic. The unique
   electronic structure of the rare-earth metal atom inhibits hydrogen
   bonding with interfacial water molecules resulting in a hydrophobic
   hydration structure where the surface oxygen atoms are the only hydrogen
   bonding sites. Hence, the presence of excess surface oxygen can lead to
   increased hydrogen bonding and thereby reduce hydrophobicity of REOs.
   Herein, we demonstrate how surface stoichiometry and surface relaxations
   can impact wetting properties of REOs. Using X-ray Photoelectron
   Spectroscopy and wetting measurements, we show that freshly sputtered
   ceria is hydrophilic due to excess surface oxygen (shown to have an O/Ce
   ratio of similar to 3 and a water contact angle of similar to 15
   degrees), which when relaxed in a clean, ultra-high vacuum environment
   isolated from airborne contaminants reaches close to stoichiometric O/Ce
   ratio (similar to 2.2) and becomes hydrophobic (contact angle of similar
   to 104 degrees). Further, we show that airborne hydrocarbon contaminants
   do not exclusively impact the wetting properties of REOs, and that
   relaxed REOs are intrinsically hydrophobic. This study provides insight
   into the role of surface relaxation on the wettability of REOs. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Optimal photon management is a key challenge for photobioreactor design,

Abstract = {{This paper presents a fusion-based neural network (NN) classification
   algorithm for 40-Hz auditory steady state response (ASSR) ensemble
   averaged signals which were recorded from eight human subjects for
   observing sleep patterns (wakefulness W-0 and deep sleep N-3 or slow
   wave sleep SWS). In SWS, sensitivity to pain is the lowest relative to
   other sleep stages and arousal needs stronger stimuli. 40-Hz ASSR
   signals were extracted by averaging over 900 sweeps on a 30-s window.
   Signals generated during N-3 deep sleep state show similarities to those
   produced when general anesthesia is given to patients during clinical
   surgery. Our experimental results show that the automatic classification
   system used identifies sleep states with an accuracy rate of 100\% when
   the training and test signals come from the same subjects while its
   accuracy is reduced to 97.6\%, on average, when signals are used from
   different training and test subjects. Our results may lead to future
   classification of consciousness and wakefulness of patients with 40-Hz

Abstract = {{Powder activated carbon (AC) injection is widely considered as the most
   viable technology for removing gaseous elemental mercury (H-g(0)) in
   flue gases of coal-fired power plants. However, sulfuric acid (H2SO4)
   can form on the external and internal surfaces of AC particles due to
   the presence of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, oxygen, and moisture in
   flue gases. This work focuses on the effects of H2SO4 and O-2 on the
   H-g(0) uptake capacity and reversibility of sulfur impregnated activated
   carbon (SIAC) under dynamic conditions. Experiments were conducted with
   25 mu g-H-g(0)/m(3) of nitrogen or air, using a semicontinuous flow
   fixed-bed reactor kept at 120 or 180 degrees C. H2SO4 had a profound
   hindering effect on H-g(0) uptake due to pore blockage. O-2
   significantly enhanced H-g(0) uptake and its reversibility, via the
   oxidation of H-g(0) which facilitated chemisorption and the subsequent
   physisorption onto chemically adsorbed Hg. Absorption of Hg in H2SO4 was
   unlikely a significant contributor, when H-g(0) concentrations were at
   levels of typical power plants (tens of ppb). The reversibility of and
   relative contributions of physisorption and chemisorption to H-g(0)
   uptake would change with H-g(0) concentrations in flue gases. These
   findings could be significant in developing a complete solution for Hg
   capture where the handling of spent sorbent materials and the possible
   secondary pollution need to be considered.}},

Abstract = {{Surface shear stress induced by different air sparging regimes on a
   submerged hollow fiber ultrafiltration module with
   horizontally-oriented, densely packed fibers was characterized.
   Continuous and intermittent (cycling on and off) coarse bubbles
   (0.75-2.5 mL), as well as large pulse bubble (150 and 500 mL) sparging
   were considered for a range of air flow rates. The power required to
   induce surface shear stress on the surface of the hollow fibers was
   substantially lower when using large pulse bubble sparging compared to
   both continuous and intermittent coarse bubble sparging. Results
   indicated that the air flow required for pulse bubble sparging was more
   than 80\% lower than that required for coarse bubble sparging to induce
   comparable surface shear stress (and corresponding fouling control).
   This study demonstrates the potential value and efficiency of pulse
   bubble air sparging as a fouling control option in densely packed hollow
   fiber membrane systems. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Digital Microfluidic Platform for the Detection of Rubella Infection and

Volume = {{61}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Whereas disease surveillance for infectious diseases such as
   rubella is important, it is critical to identify pregnant women at risk
   of passing rubella to their offspring, which can be fatal and can result
   in congenital rubella syndrome (CRS). The traditional centralized model
   for diagnosing rubella is cost-prohibitive in resource-limited settings,
   representing a major obstacle to the prevention of CRS. As a step toward
   decentralized diagnostic systems, we developed a proof-of-concept
   digital microfluidic (DMF) diagnostic platform that possesses the
   flexibility and performance of automated immunoassay platforms used in
   central facilities, but with a form factor the size of a shoebox.
   METHODS: DMF immunoassays were developed with integrated sample
   preparation for the detection of rubella virus (RV) IgG and IgM. The
   performance (sensitivity and specificity) of the assays was evaluated
   with serum and plasma samples from a commercial antirubella mixed-titer
   performance panel.
   RESULTS: The new platform performed the essential processing steps,
   including sample aliquoting for 4 parallel assays, sample dilution, and
   IgG blocking. Testing of performance panel samples yielded diagnostic
   sensitivity and specificity of 100\% and 100\% for both RV IgG and RV
   IgM. With 1.8 mu L sample per assay, 4 parallel assays were performed in
   approximately 30 min with <10\% mean CV.
   CONCLUSIONS: This proof of concept establishes DMF-powered immunoassays
   as being potentially useful for the diagnosis of infectious disease. (C)

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{This work analyses the effects of microwaves on the production of char
   the solid product of pyrolysis. Using pulp mill sludge and a 1200 W
   microwave oven, the pyrolysis of the sludge was analyzed and compared
   with that of conventional heating. Alkali metal hydroxide is an
   effective microwave absorber; adding a mass fraction of 5\% of KOH to
   dried sludge enabled a complete pyrolysis in a few minutes, compared to
   hours in conventional pyrolysis. Microwave-assisted pyrolysis, however,
   retained 20\% less carbon from the sludge, likely caused by the faster
   release of volatiles. The secondary sludge yielded more char than the
   primary sludge, which may be attributed to its greater protein content.
   Microwave-assisted combined pyrolysis and activation was feasible, due
   to the dual roles of alkali metal hydroxides as activating agent and
   microwave absorber. The combined one-step process generated an activated
   carbon with a specific surface area of 660 m(2)g(-1) from the sludge in
   three minutes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The present study provides a deeper view of protein functionality as a
   function of temperature, salt and pressure in deep-sea habitats. A set
   of eight different enzymes from five distinct deep-sea (3040-4908m
   depth), moderately warm (14.0-16.5 degrees C) biotopes, characterized by
   a wide range of salinities (39-348 practical salinity units), were
   investigated for this purpose. An enzyme from a superficial' marine
   hydrothermal habitat (65 degrees C) was isolated and characterized for
   comparative purposes. We report here the first experimental evidence
   suggesting that in salt-saturated deep-sea habitats, the adaptation to
   high pressure is linked to high thermal resistance (P value=0.0036).
   Salinity might therefore increase the temperature window for enzyme
   activity, and possibly microbial growth, in deep-sea habitats. As an
   example, Lake Medee, the largest hypersaline deep-sea anoxic lake of the
   Eastern Mediterranean Sea, where the water temperature is never higher
   than 16 degrees C, was shown to contain halopiezophilic-like enzymes
   that are most active at 70 degrees C and with denaturing temperatures of
   71.4 degrees C. The determination of the crystal structures of five
   proteins revealed unknown molecular mechanisms involved in protein
   adaptation to poly-extremes as well as distinct active site
   architectures and substrate preferences relative to other structurally
   characterized enzymes.}},

Abstract = {{Population and per capita gross domestic product (GDP) projections are
   used to estimate total global municipal solid waste (MSW) generation
   over the twenty-first century. Some projections for global population
   suggest that it will peak this century. Waste generation rates per
   capita generally increase with affluence, although in the most affluent
   countries there is also a trend toward dematerialization. The confluence
   of these factors means that at some point in the future total global
   waste generation could possibly peak. To determine when peak waste might
   occur, we used the shared-socioeconomic pathway scenarios (used in
   Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change {[}IPCC] studies) combined
   with estimates of municipal solid waste (MSW) generation rates,
   extrapolated from our work for the World Bank. Despite the expectation
   that total MSW generation in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) and high-income countries will peak mid-century, with
   current trajectories global peak waste is not expected before 2100. The
   peak could be moved forward to around 2075 and reduced in intensity by
   some 30\% if a more aggressive sustainability growth scenario were
   followed, rather than the current business-as-usual scenario. Further,
   the magnitude of peak waste is sensitive to the intensity of waste
   generation; it could vary from 7.3 to 10.9 megatonnes per day under the
   sustainability scenario. The timing of peak waste will substantially
   depend on the development of cities in Sub-Saharan Africa, where
   population growth rates are more than double the rest of the world.}},

Title = {{Effect of below-the-knee compression stockings on severity of
   obstructive sleep apnea}},
Journal = {{SLEEP MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{16}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{258-264}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Overnight fluid shift from the legs to the neck may narrow
   the upper airway and contribute to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
   pathogenesis. We hypothesized that below-the-knee compression stockings
   will decrease OSA severity in a general OSA population by decreasing
   daytime leg fluid accumulation and overnight fluid shift and increasing
   upper-airway size.
   Methods: Patients with OSA (apnea-hypopnea index >= 10) were randomized
   to wear compression stockings during the daytime or to a control group
   for 2 weeks. Overnight polysomnography with measurement of leg and neck
   fluid volumes and upper-airway cross-sectional area before and after
   sleep was performed at baseline and follow-up. The primary outcome was
   change in the apnea-hypopnea index.
   Results: Twenty-two patients randomized to compression stockings and 23
   to control completed the study. The apnea-hypopnea index decreased
   significantly more in the compression stockings than in the control
   group (from 32.4 +/- 20.0 to 23.8 +/- 15.5 vs. from 31.2 +/- 25.0 to
   30.3 +/- 23.8, p = 0.042), in association with a significantly greater
   reduction in the overnight decrease in leg fluid volume (p = 0.028), and
   a significantly greater increase in morning upper-airway cross-sectional
   area (p = 0.006). Overnight change in neck fluid volume was unchanged.
   Conclusion: These observations suggest that in, a general OSA
   population, below-the-knee compression stockings decrease OSA severity
   modestly via attenuation of overnight fluid shift and consequent
   upperairway dilatation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Self-Sensing Porphysomes for Fluorescence-Guided Photothermal Therapy}},
Journal = {{BIOCONJUGATE CHEMISTRY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{345-351}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Porphysomes are highly quenched unilamellar porphyrin-lipid nanovesicles
   with structurally dependent photothermal properties. The high packing
   density of porphyrin molecules in the lipid bilayer enables their
   application in photothermal therapy, whereas the partial disruption of
   the porphysome structure over time restores the porphyrin fluorescence
   and enables the fluorescence-guided photothermal ablation. This
   conversion is a time-dependent process and cannot be easily followed
   using existing analytical techniques. Here we present the design of a
   novel self-sensing porphysome (FRETysomes) capable of fluorescently
   broadcasting its structural state through Forster resonance energy
   transfer. By doping in a near-infrared emitting fluorophore, it is
   possible to divert a small fraction of the absorbed energy toward
   fluorescence emission which provides information on whether the vesicle
   is intact or disrupted. Addition of bacteriopheophorbide-lipid into the
   vesicle bilayer as a fluorescence acceptor (0.5-7.5 mol \%) yields a
   large separation of 100 nm between the absorption and fluorescence bands
   of the nanoparticle. Furthermore, a progressive increase in FRET
   efficiency (14.6-72.7\%) is observed. Photothermal heating and serum
   stability in FRETysomes is comparable with the undoped porphysomes. The
   fluorescence arising from the energy transfer between the donor and
   acceptor dyes can be clearly visualized in vivo through hyperspectral
   imaging. By calculating the ratio between the acceptor and donor
   fluorescence, it is possible to determine the structural fate of the
   nanovesicles. We observe using this technique that tumor accumulation of
   structurally intact porphyrin-lipid nanovesicles persists at 24 and 48 h
   postinjection. The development of FRETysomes offers a unique and
   critical imaging tool for planning porphysome-enabled
   fluorescence-guided photothermal treatment, which maximizes
   light-induced thermal toxicity.}},

Journal = {{CURRENT ONCOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{E27-E37}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background
   This evidence-based practice guideline was developed to update and
   address new issues in the handling of cytotoxics, including the use of
   oral cytotoxics; the selection and use of personal protective equipment;
   and treatment in diverse settings, including the home setting.
   Methods
   The guideline was developed primarily from an adaptation and endorsement
   of an existing guideline and from three systematic reviews. Before
   publication, the guideline underwent a series of peer and external
   reviews to gather feedback. All comments were addressed, and the
   guideline was amended when required. The guideline applies to health
   care workers who could come into contact with cytotoxic drugs at any
   point in the medication circuit. The intended users are hospital
   administrators, educators, and managers; occupational health and safety
   services; and pharmacy and health care workers.
   Results
   The recommendations represent a reasonable and practical set of
   procedures that the intended users of this guideline should implement to
   minimize opportunities for accidental exposure. They are not limited to
   just the point of care; they cover the entire chain of cytotoxics
   handling from the time such agents enter the institution until they
   leave in the patient or as waste.
   Conclusions Reducing the likelihood of accidental exposure to cytotoxic
   agents within the medication circuit is the main objective of this
   evidenced-based guideline. The recommendations differ slightly from
   earlier guidelines because of the availability of new evidence.}},

Title = {{Associations of distraction involvement and age with driver injury
   severities}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SAFETY RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{52}},
Pages = {{23-28}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: This paper investigates the associations between the
   severity of injuries sustained by a driver who is involved in a
   two-vehicle crash, the existence and type of driver distraction as well
   as driver's age. Few studies investigated distraction as it relates to
   injury severity. Moreover, these studies did not consider driver age
   which is a significant factor related to driving behavior and the
   ability to respond in a crash situation. Methods: An ordered logit model
   was built to predict injury severity sustained by drivers using data
   from the U.S. National Automotive Sampling System's General Estimates
   System (2003 to 2008). Various factors (e.g., weather, gender, and
   speeding) were statistically controlled for, but the main focus was on
   the interaction of driver age and distraction type. Results: The trends
   observed for young and mid-age drivers were similar. For these age
   groups, dialing or texting on the cell phone, passengers, and in-vehicle
   sources resulted in an increase in a likelihood of more severe injuries.
   Talking on the cell phone had a similar effect for younger drivers but
   was not significant for mid-age drivers. Inattention and distractions
   outside the vehicle decreased the odds of severe injuries. For older
   drivers, the highest odds of severe injuries were observed with dialing
   or texting on a cell phone, followed by in-vehicle sources and talking
   on the cell phone. All these sources were associated with an increased
   likelihood of injury severity. Similar to young and mid-age drivers,
   distractions outside the vehicle decreased the odds of severe injuries.
   Other distraction types did not have a significant effect for the older
   age group. Conclusions: The results support previous literature and
   extend our understanding of crash injury severity. Practical
   applications: The findings have implications for policy making and the
   design of distraction mitigation systems. (C) 2014 National Safety

Abstract = {{Endophentoypes, quantifiable traits lying on the causal chain between a
   clinical phenotype and etiology, can be used to accelerate genomic
   discovery in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Here we identify the
   neuroanatomic changes that are shared by 22 OCD adult and adolescent
   patients and 25 of their unaffected siblings who are at genetic risk for
   the disorder. Comparisons were made against 47 age and sex matched
   healthy controls. We defined the surface morphology of the striatum,
   globus pallidus and thalamus, and thickness of the cerebral cortex.
   Patients with OCD show significant surface expansion compared with
   healthy controls, following adjustment for multiple comparisons, in
   interconnected regions of the caudate, thalamus and right orbitofrontal
   cortex. Their unaffected siblings show similar, significant expansion,
   most marked in the ventromedial caudate bilaterally, the right pulvinar
   thalamic nucleus and the right orbitofrontal cortex. These regions
   define a network that has been consistently implicated in OCD. In
   addition, both patients with OCD and unaffected siblings showed similar
   increased thickness of the right precuneus, which receives rich input
   from the thalamic pulvinar nuclei and the left medial temporal cortex.
   Anatomic change within the orbitofrontostriatal and posterior brain
   circuitry thus emerges as a promising endophenotype for OCD.}},

Abstract = {{A new application of porous ceramics as the attenuative backing element
   in high-temperature transducers is introduced. By introducing pores of
   different volume fractions and various sizes into the ceramic matrix,
   acoustic impedance and attenuation can be controlled to match their
   optimal values as predicted by a simple numerical model of the entire
   transducer, coupled with a model of the attenuative effect of the pores.
   This concept was applied to the design and manufacture of porous 3mol\%
   Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) backing elements for a 2.8-MHz lithium
   niobate (LiNbO3) piezoelectric crystal, with a targeted operating
   temperature of 700 degrees C to 800 degrees C. Acoustic measurements
   revealed that the actual acoustic impedance and attenuation of the
   porous samples matched well with their predicted values. The design and
   fabrication process can be employed in manufacturing backing elements
   for a variety of transducers with specified center frequency and signal
   bandwidth.}},

Abstract = {{A cross-network cross-layer design method is proposed to exploit the
   trunking, diversity, and best service assignment gains available in a
   heterogeneous wireless network (HWN), consisting of orthogonal radio
   access networks (RANs) and interference-limited RANs. Accounting for
   traffic-level dynamics and channel fading, we jointly design the
   distribution strategy for elastic and inelastic traffic, and the radio
   resource management strategy for RANs, in a network-separable control
   architecture. Optimal and quantified near-optimal radio allocation
   schemes are proposed for each type of RAN, which are combined into an
   on-line design framework that over time provides asymptotically optimal
   performance, maximizing the sum throughput utility for elastic traffic
   while guaranteeing the throughput requirements of inelastic traffic.
   Extensive simulation results demonstrate substantial performance
   improvement against suboptimal alternatives.}},

Abstract = {{The two-component regulatory system SsrA-SsrB in Salmonella enterica
   controls expression of a virulence gene program required for
   intracellular survival in host cells. SsrA signaling is induced within
   the acidic host vacuole in which the bacteria reside; however, the
   mechanism by which SsrA senses this intracellular environment is
   unknown. Here, we show that the periplasmic sensor domain of SsrA is
   enriched in histidine residues that increase SsrA signaling below
   external pH of 6. While no single histidine accounted for the full
   acid-responsiveness of SsrA, we localized the acid-responsiveness
   principally to five histidines in the C-terminal end of the periplasmic
   sensor domain, with input from additional histidines in the N-terminal
   end of the senor. A sensor mutant lacking critical pH-responsive
   histidines was defective for acid-promoted activity, yet retained basal
   activity similar to wild type at neutral pH, indicating that the role of
   these histidines is to enhance signaling in response to acidification.
   In support of this, a pH-blind mutant was insensitive to the vacuole
   acidification blocking activity of bafilomycin, and was attenuated for
   competitive fitness during infection of mice. Our data demonstrate that
   SsrA contains a histidine-rich periplasmic sensor that enhances
   signaling in response to the innate host defense of vacuolar
   acidification.}},

Abstract = {{Extremely thin-absorber solar cells offer low materials utilization and
   simplified manufacture but require improved means to enhance photon
   absorption in the active layer. Here, we report enhanced-absorption
   colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells that feature transfer-stamped
   solution-processed pyramid-shaped electrodes employed in a
   hierarchically structured device. The pyramids increase, by up to a
   factor of 2, the external quantum efficiency of the device at
   absorption-limited wavelengths near the absorber band edge. We show that
   absorption enhancement can be optimized with increased pyramid angle
   with an appreciable net improvement in power conversion efficiency, that
   is, with the gain in current associated with improved absorption and
   extraction overcoming the smaller fractional decrease in open-circuit
   voltage associated with increased junction area. We show that the
   hierarchical combination of micron-scale structured electrodes with
   nanoscale films provides for an optimized enhancement at
   absorption-limited wavelengths. We fabricate 54.7 degrees
   pyramid-patterned electrodes, conformally apply the quantum dot films,
   and report pyramid CQD solar cells that exhibit a 24\% improvement in
   overall short-circuit current density with champion devices providing a
   power conversion efficiency of 9.2\%.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To appraise the current videofluoroscopic evidence on the
   reduction of aspiration using thickened liquids in the head and neck
   cancer population.
   Data Sources Search terms relating to deglutition or dysphagia or
   swallow and neoplasms and oncology or head and neck cancer and viscosity
   or texture and apira or residu{*} were combined with honey or nectar,
   xerostomia, and respiratory aspiration using Boolean operators.
   Review Methods A multiengine literature search identified 337
   nonduplicate articles, of which 6 were judged to be relevant. These
   underwent detailed review for study quality and qualitative synthesis.
   Results The articles reviewed in detail predominantly described
   heterogeneous study samples with small sample sizes, making for
   difficult interpretation and generalization of results. Rates of
   aspiration were typically not reported by bolus consistency, despite the
   fact that a variety of stimulus consistencies was used during a
   videofluoroscopic swallowing study. Studies confirmed that aspiration is
   a major concern in the head and neck cancer population and reported a
   trend toward more frequent aspiration after (chemo)radiotherapy.
   Conclusion Overall, the literature on thickened liquids as an
   intervention to eliminate aspiration in the head and neck cancer
   population is limited. Because aspiration is known to be prevalent in
   the head and neck cancer population and thickened liquids are known to
   eliminate aspiration in other populations, it is important to determine
   the effectiveness of thickened liquids for reducing aspiration in the
   head and neck cancer population.}},

Abstract = {{The effects of SiO2 and TiO2 nanofillers on a poly(ethylene oxide)
   (PEO)-1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium hydrogensulfate (EMIHSO4) electrolyte
   were studied and compared with respect to ionic conductivity,
   crystallinity, and dielectric properties over a temperature range from
   -10 degrees C to 80 degrees C. X-ray diffraction and differential
   scanning calorimetry were used to study the impact of fillers on the
   structure of the polymer electrolytes. Using an electrochemical
   capacitor model, impedance (complex capacitance) and dielectric analyses
   were performed to understand the ionic conduction process with and
   without fillers in both semi-crystalline and amorphous states. Despite
   their different nanostructures, both SiO2 and TiO2 promoted an amorphous
   structure in PEO-EMIHSO4 and increased the ionic conductivity by a
   factor of two. While in the amorphous phase, the dielectric constant
   characteristic of the fillers (TiO2 in this case) contributed to
   increased conductivity and cell capacitance. Combining complex
   capacitance and dielectric analyses is an effective approach to study
   solid electrochemical capacitors and to identify and explain the impact
   of different fillers on ionic conduction of polymer electrolytes. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper presents a new energy efficient successive approximation
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) using a charge recycling and LSB-down
   switching scheme for the capacitive digital-to-analog converter (CDAC).
   Compared to the conventional binary weighed CDAC, the proposed technique
   exhibits a 95\% reduction in switching energy, a 50\% reduction in
   capacitor area, and with 30\% reduction in nonlinearity under the same
   unit capacitor size and matching condition. The improvement on the
   switching energy consumption is the best among reported CDAC switching
   techniques. To validate the technique, a prototype of 10-bit ADC is
   fabricated in a 0.13 mu m CMOS technology using standard capacitors.
   With a unit capacitor size of 30 fF, the ADC consumes 15.6 mu W from a
   0.5 V digital supply and a 1 V analog supply. The measured
   signal-to-noise-plus-distortion ratio is 54.6 dB at 1.1 MS/s. The FOM is
   31.8 fJ/conv.-step, which is among the best when normalized to the same
   unit capacitor size.}},

Abstract = {{PurposeTo evaluate a new formulation of manganese porphyrin as a
   potential gadolinium (Gd)-free extracellular magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) contrast agent for dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI of tumors.
   Materials and MethodsA previously reported new contrast agent, MnTCP,
   was evaluated in six female tumor-bearing nude rats. MRI was performed
   on a 3 T clinical scanner 3 to 4 weeks after inoculation of breast tumor
   cells in the mammary fat pads. Gd-DTPA was injected intravenously,
   followed by injection of MnTCP at least 2 hours later (both at 0.05
   mmol/kg). T-1 relaxation time measurements and DCE-MRI were performed.
   ResultsEnhancement and clearance patterns were visually similar between
   MnTCP and Gd-DTPA. However, relative R-1 increases in all 11 tumors were
   larger for MnTCP over 60 minutes postcontrast, the difference being
   significant as late as 20 minutes (R-1post/R-1pre=1.420.15 for MnTCP vs.
   1.20 +/- 0.08 for Gd-DTPA, P<0.05). R-1-related effects for MnTCP were
   largely reduced after 60 minutes (R-1post/R-1pre=1.13 +/- 0.07) and
   completely gone within 24 hours (R-1post/R-1pre=0.97 +/- 0.06). DCE-MRI
   revealed a consistently larger (1.5 to over 2-fold) peak enhancement and
   higher values of the steepest slope, time-to-peak, and AUC(60) in all
   tumors with MnTCP (P<0.01).
   ConclusionMnTCP is an alternative to extracellular Gd agents for tumor
   imaging, offering sensitive detection and rapid renal clearance. J.

Title = {{Enhancement of Facial Nerve Motoneuron Regeneration through Cross-Face
   Nerve Grafts by Adding End-to-Side Sensory Axons}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: In unilateral facial palsy, cross-face nerve grafts are used
   for emotional facial reanimation. Facial nerve regeneration through the
   grafts takes several months, and the functional results are sometimes
   inadequate. Chronic denervation of the cross-face nerve graft results in
   incomplete nerve regeneration. The authors hypothesize that donor axons
   from regional sensory nerves will enhance facial motoneuron
   regeneration, improve axon regeneration, and improve the amplitude of
   facial muscle movement.
   Methods: In the rat model, a 30-mm nerve graft (right common peroneal
   nerve) was used as a cross-face nerve graft. The graft was coapted to
   the proximal stump of the transected right buccal branch of the facial
   nerve and the distal stumps of the transected left buccal and marginal
   mandibular branches. In one group, sensory occipital nerves were coapted
   end-to-side to the cross-face nerve graft. Regeneration of green
   fluorescent protein-positive axons was imaged in vivo in transgenic
   Thy1-green fluorescent protein rats, in which all neurons express green
   fluorescence. After 16 weeks, retrograde labeling of regenerated neurons
   and histomorphometric analysis of myelinated axons was performed.
   Functional outcomes were assessed with video analysis of whisker motion.
   Results: ``Pathway protection{''} with sensory axons significantly
   enhanced motoneuron regeneration, as assessed by retrograde labeling, in
   vivo fluorescence imaging, and histomorphometry, and significantly
   improved whisker motion during video analysis.
   Conclusion: Sensory pathway protection of cross-face nerve grafts
   counteracts chronic denervation in nerve grafts and improves
   regeneration and functional outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{The fundamental combustion and emissions properties of advanced biofuels
   are reviewed, and their impact on engine performance is discussed, in
   order to guide the selection of optimal conversion routes for obtaining
   desired fuel combustion properties. Advanced biofuels from second- and
   third-generation feedstocks can result in significantly reduced
   life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions, compared to traditional fossil
   fuels or first-generation bioftiels from food-based feedstocks. These
   advanced biofuels include alcohols, biodiesel, or synthetic hydrocarbons
   obtained either from hydrotreatment of oxygenated biofuels or from
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The engine performance and exhaust pollutant
   emissions of advanced biofuels are linked to their fundamental
   combustion properties, which can be modeled using combustion
   chemical-kinetic mechanisms and surrogate fuel blends. In general,
   first-generation or advanced biofuels perform well in existing
   combustion engines, either as blend additives with petro-fuels or as
   pure ``drop-in{''} replacements. Generally, oxygenated biofuels produce
   lower intrinsic nitric-oxide and soot emissions than hydrocarbon fuels
   in fundamental experiments, but engine-test results can be complicated
   by multiple factors. In order to reduce engine emissions and improve
   fuel efficiency, several novel technologies, including engines and fuel
   cells, are being developed. The future fuel requirements for a selection
   of such novel power-generation technologies, along with their potential
   performance improvements over existing technologies, are discussed. The
   trend in the biofuels and transportation industries appears to be moving
   towards drop-in fuels that require little changes in vehicle or fueling
   infrastructure, but this comes at a cost of reduced life-cycle
   efficiencies for the overall alternative-fuel production and utilization
   system. In the future, fuel-flexible, high-efficiency, and
   ultra-low-emissions heat-engine and fuel-cell technologies promise to
   enable consumers to switch to the lowest-cost and cleanest fuel
   available in their market at any given time. This would also enable
   society as a whole to maximize its global level of transportation
   activity, while maintaining urban air quality, within an energy- and
   carbon-constrained world. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Current approaches to cartilage tissue engineering require a large
   number of chondrocytes. Although chondrocyte numbers can be expanded in
   monolayer culture, the cells dedifferentiate and unless they can be
   redifferentiated are not optimal to use for cartilage repair. We took
   advantage of the differential effect of culture conditions on the
   ability of passaged and primary chondrocytes to form cartilage tissue to
   dissect out the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules produced and
   accumulated in the early stages of passaged cell cartilage tissue
   formation as we hypothesized that passaged bovine cells that form
   cartilage accumulate a pericellular matrix that differs from cells that
   do not form cartilage. Twice passaged bovine chondrocytes (P2)
   (cartilage forming), or as a control primary chondrocytes (P0) (which do
   not generate cartilage), were cultured on three-dimensional membrane
   inserts in serum-free media. P2 redifferentiation was occurring during
   the first 8 days as indicated by increased expression of the
   chondrogenic genes Sox9, collagen type II, aggrecan, and COMP,
   suggesting that this is an appropriate time period to examine the ECM.
   Mass spectrometry showed that the P2 secretome (molecules released into
   the media) at 1 week had higher levels of collagen types I, III, and
   XII, and versican while type II collagen and COMP were found at higher
   levels in the P0 secretome. There was increased collagen synthesis and
   retention by P2 cells compared to P0 cells as early as 3 days of
   culture. Confocal microscopy showed that types XII, III, and II
   collagen, aggrecan, versican, and decorin were present in the ECM of P2
   cells. In contrast, collagen types I, II, and III, aggrecan, and decorin
   were present in the ECM of P0 cells. As primary chondrocytes grown in
   serum-containing media, a condition that allows for the generation of
   cartilage tissue in vitro, also accumulate versican and collagen XII,
   this study suggests that these molecules may be necessary to provide a
   microenvironment that supports hyaline cartilage formation. Further
   study is required to determine if these molecules are also accumulated
   by passaged human chondrocytes and their role in promoting hyaline
   cartilage formation.}},

Abstract = {{A better understanding of the factors governing the vascularization of
   engineered tissues is crucial for their advancement as therapeutic
   platforms. Here, we studied the effect of implant volume and cell
   densities on the in vivo vascularization of modular engineered tissue
   constructs. Sub-millimeter collagen modules containing adipose-derived
   mesenchymal stromal cells (adMSC) and enveloped by human umbilical vein
   endothelial cells (HUVEC) were subcutaneously implanted in
   severe-combined immunodeficient mice with a beige-mutation (SCID-bg)
   mice. Implant volume and cell density was varied relative to a base
   case, defined as a 0.01 mL implant containing 1.5x10(7) adMSC/mL and
   3.9x10(6) HUVEC/mL. At 7 and 14 days post-transplantation, the
   constructs were harvested for immunohistochemical analysis of total
   (CD31(+)) and graft-derived (UEA1(+)) vessel formation,
   hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1 alpha) expression, infiltration
   of host-derived leukocytes (CD45), and macrophages (F4/80). Implant
   volume and cell density affected the relative contributions of host-
   versus graft-derived vascularization, highlighting that different
   mechanisms underlie the two processes. Graft-derived vessel formation
   was most rapid and robust in implants with high HIF1 alpha expression,
   namely large volume implants and implants with high adMSC and HUVEC
   density (p<0.01 compared to base case at day 7). Many HIF1 alpha(+)
   cells were vessel-lining HUVEC, suggesting that HIF1 activation may be
   key to vessel assembly in the graft. Host vessel ingrowth, however,
   dominated the vascularization of small volume implants (of high and low
   adMSC density alike), which showed low HIF1 alpha expression at day 7.
   Host vessels were sustained to day 14 when adMSC density alone was
   increased, presumably due to increased paracrine secretions. This study
   points to a potential role of HIF1 activation in the vascularization of
   tissue constructs, which may be harnessed to engineer robust vessels for
   therapeutic applications.}},

Title = {{Unique influence of stimulus duration and stimulation site (glabrous vs.

Volume = {{19}},

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe application to the skin of spatially interlaced innocuous
   warm (40 degrees C) and cool (20 degrees C) thermodes (termed a thermal
   grill - TG) can produce an unusual thermal percept, but the mechanisms
   remain unclear.
   MethodsWe compared the percept quality and intensity over a 120-s period
   evoked by each of three configurations of a 6-bar thermal stimulator
   (6TS): all 40 degrees C(WARM); all 20 degrees C(COOL); alternating bars
   40/20 degrees C (TG) at two body sites (forearm and palm).
   ResultsBoth unpleasantness and pain were significantly greater for the
   TG-induced (vs. either COOL- or WARM-induced) percept. Unpleasantness
   ratings were significantly higher than pain intensity ratings. Several
   emotional qualitative descriptors were unique to the TG-induced percept.
   TG palmar (vs. forearm) stimulation produced a more intense percept and
   was perceived as painful in more subjects. Temporal profiles of
   intensities of TG-induced percepts differed from those induced by the
   COOL or WARM thermodes alone. For both unpleasantness and pain, the site
   differences in the temporal profile were also unique for TG versus the
   COOL- or WARM-evoked percepts. Qualitative characteristics of the
   TG-induced percept varied over time and between subjects.
   ConclusionsThe TG percept intensity and temporal profile were different
   from those evoked by either of its component parts. The perceived
   quality is person-specific. These differences suggest that the classic
   TG illusion' results from complex central integration of several types
   of peripheral afferent inputs activated by the TG. Differing body
   site-related roles of thermosensory afferents in discrimination versus
   temperature homeostasis may explain site-related variations in the
   percept.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS ENGINEERING AND PERFORMANCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{24}},

Abstract = {{The presence of a cold shot in an aircraft turbine blade can lead to the
   catastrophic failure of the blade and ultimately to the failure of the
   power plant. Currently, no nondestructive evaluation (NDE) method exists
   to detect this kind of defect. This deficiency is primarily due to the
   fact that the only known cold shot defects in existence are those found
   in failed blades. Therefore, in order to develop effective NDE methods,
   reference specimens are needed which mimic the embedded oxide layer that
   is a primary distinguishing feature of a cold shot. Here, we present a
   procedure to synthetically reproduce the features of a real cold shot in
   Inconel 600 and the precise characterization of this oxide layer as a
   reference specimen suitable for NDE evaluation. As a first step to
   develop a suitable NDE technique, high-frequency ultrasound simulations
   are considered. A theoretical 1-D model is developed in order to
   quantify the multiple reflection-transmission trajectory of the acoustic
   wave in the reference specimen. This paper also presents an experimental
   determination of the density and the Young's modulus of the Inconel 600
   oxide, which are required as inputs to calculate the acoustic impedance
   used in the theoretical model.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Discontinuities in brittle geomaterials, including concrete and rock,
   represent localized zones of weakness and enhanced hydraulic
   transmissivity that often control the hydromechanical behavior of the
   medium. The shearing of discontinuities and the resulting morphological
   changes can significantly alter this behavior. In this work, a procedure
   is developed to characterize sheared discontinuity replicas as a
   function of the applied normal load using X-ray micro-computed
   tomography (micro-CT) imagery. A specimen design and testing procedure
   that facilitates CT scanning is presented along with an image processing
   procedure to quantify the morphological changes in the specimens.
   Subsequently, the results of direct shear testing and image-based
   measurements of mean fracture aperture, surface area, median effective
   aperture, and the preferential orientation of fracture void space are
   presented and discussed. Application of the procedure developed herein
   yields characteristics of the morphology of sheared discontinuities that
   were previously not possible to obtain or that were time consuming to
   collect with destructive sectioning methods.}},

Abstract = {{We present a 320-channel active probe for high-spatial-resolution
   neuromonitoring and responsive neurostimulation. The probe comprises an
   integrated circuit (IC) cell array bonded to the back side of a
   pitch-matched microelectrode array. The IC enables up to 256-site neural
   recording and 64-site neural stimulation at the spatial resolution of
   400 mu m and 200 mu m, respectively. It is suitable for direct
   integration with electrode arrays with the shank pitch of
   integermultiples of 200 mu m. In the presented configuration, the IC is
   bonded with a 8 x 8 400 mu m-pitch Utah electrode array (UEA) and up to
   additional 192 recording channels are used for peripheral
   neuromonitoring. The 0.35 mu m CMOS circuit array has a total die size
   of 3.5 mm x 3.65 mm. Each stimulator channel employs a current memory
   for simultaneous multi-site neurostimulation, outputs 20 mu A-250 mu A
   square or arbitrary waveformcurrent, occupies 0.02 mm(2), and dissipates
   2.76 mu Wquiescent power. Each fully differential recording channel has
   two stages of amplification and filtering and an 8-bit single-slope ADC,
   occupies 0.035mm(2), and consumes 51.9 mu W. The neural probe has been
   experimentally validated in epileptic seizure propagation studies in a
   mouse hippocampal slice in vitro and in responsive neurostimulation for
   seizure suppression in an acute epilepsy rat model in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{CRISPR-Cas systems provide adaptive microbial immunity against invading
   viruses and plasmids. The cariogenic bacterium Streptococcus mutans
   UA159 has two CRISPR-Cas systems: CRISPR1 (type II-A) and CRISPR2 (type
   I-C) with several spacers from both CRISPR cassettes matching sequences
   of phage M102 or genomic sequences of other S. mutans. The deletion of
   the cas genes of CRISPR1 (Delta C1S), CRISPR2 (Delta C2E), or both
   CRISPR1 + 2 (Delta C1SC2E) or the removal of spacers 2 and 3 (Delta
   CR1SP13E) in S. mutans UA159 did not affect phage sensitivity when
   challenged with virulent phage M102. Using plasmid transformation
   experiments, we demonstrated that the CRISPR1-Cas system inhibits
   transformation of S. mutans by the plasmids matching the spacers 2 and
   3. Functional analysis of the cas deletion mutants revealed that in
   addition to a role in plasmid targeting, both CRISPR systems also
   contribute to the regulation of bacterial physiology in S. mutans.
   Compared to wild-type cells, the Delta C1S strain displayed diminished
   growth under cell membrane and oxidative stress, enhanced growth under
   low pH, and had reduced survival under heat shock and DNA-damaging
   conditions, whereas the Delta C2E strain exhibited increased sensitivity
   to heat shock. Transcriptional analysis revealed that the two-component
   signal transduction system VicR/K differentially modulates expression of
   cas genes within CRISPR-Cas systems, suggesting that VicR/K might
   coordinate the expression of two CRISPR-Cas systems. Collectively, we
   provide in vivo evidence that the type II-A CRISPR-Cas system of S.
   mutans may be targeted to manipulate its stress response and to
   influence the host to control the uptake and dissemination of antibiotic
   resistance genes.}},

Title = {{Theoretical and experimental investigation of a nonlinear

   excitations}},
Journal = {{SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{Harvesting ambient vibration energy is a promising method for realizing
   self-powered autonomous operation for low-power electronic devices. Most
   energy harvesters developed to date employ bending-beam configurations
   and work around the resonant points. There are two critical problems
   that have hindered the widespread adoption of energy harvesters:
   insufficient power output and narrow working bandwidth. To overcome
   these problems, we proposed a novel energy harvester, called a
   high-efficiency compressive-mode piezoelectric energy harvester
   (HC-PEH). The HC-PEH delicately synthesizes the merits of the force
   amplification effect of the flexural motion and the dynamic properties
   of elastic beams, and thus is capable of high power output with wide
   working bandwidth. In this paper, theoretical and experimental studies
   were performed on the HC-PEH. Taking nonlinear stiffness, nonlinear
   damping, and nonlinear piezoelectricity into account, we developed an
   analytical model that provides comprehensive insight into the nonlinear
   mechanical and electrical behaviors of the system. The analytical
   results closely render the experimental data and demonstrate great
   performance enhancement. In the experiment, a maximum power output of
   54.7mW is generated at 26 Hz under an acceleration of 4.9 m s(-2), which
   is over one order of magnitude higher than other stateof- the-art
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{A constrained sufficient statistic (CSS)-based distributed particle
   filter (CSS/DPF) implementation is proposed for nonlinear bearing-only
   and joint bearing/range tracking applications in sensor networks. The
   CSS/DPF runs localized particle filters at nodes constituting the sensor
   network and uses the resulting local sufficient statistics (LSS) to
   compute the global sufficient statistics (GSS) for the overall system.
   The CSS/DPF is, therefore, a two-step procedure: i) the means of the
   LSSs for the local filters are computed by running average consensus
   algorithms, which are then used to derive the corresponding GSSs, and
   ii) each node renews the local weights of the localized particle filters
   using the updated GSSs. The attractive feature of the CSS/DPF is the
   reduced number of consensus runs as compared with the state-of-art
   consensus-based DPF implementations. To further reduce the consensus
   overhead, we couple the CSS/DPF with the distributed unscented particle
   filter (DUPF), collectively referred to as the CSS/DUPF, which extends
   the linear consensus and innovation framework to nonlinear distributed
   estimation. Our Monte Carlo simulations show that the performance of the
   CSS/DUPF follows that of the centralized particle filter, even with a
   limited number of iterations per consensus run.}},

Abstract = {{Retail stores contain a wide range of products that can emit a variety
   of indoor pollutants. Among these chemicals, phthalate esters and
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are two important categories of
   semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs). Filters in heating,
   ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system collect particles from
   large volumes of air and thus potentially provide spatially and
   temporally integrated SVOC concentrations. This study measured six
   phthalate and 14 PBDE compounds in HVAC filter dust in 14 retail stores
   in Texas and Pennsylvania, United States. Phthalates and PBDEs were
   widely found in the HVAC filter dust in retail environment, indicating
   that they are ubiquitous indoor pollutants. The potential co-occurrence
   of phthalates and PBDEs was not strong, suggesting that their indoor
   sources are diverse. The levels of phthalates and PBDEs measured in HVAC
   filter dust are comparable to concentrations found in previous
   investigations of settled dust in residential buildings. Significant
   correlations between indoor air and filter dust concentrations were
   found for diethyl phthalate, di-n-butyl phthalate, and benzyl butyl
   phthalate. Reasonable agreement between measurements and an equilibrium
   model to describe SVOC partitioning between dust and gas-phase is

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present an optimal preventive maintenance policy and

   control-limit maintenance policies with two different inspection

   solved in a semi-Markov decision process framework. The objective is to
   minimize the long-run expected average cost. A formula for the mean
   residual life is derived for the proposed degradation model and a
   control limit policy, which enables the estimation of the remaining
   useful life and early maintenance planning based on the observed
   degradation process. An example is presented to demonstrate the

Abstract = {{This paper aims to provide a guideline for numerical modeling of
   reinforced concrete (RC) frame elements for the seismic performance
   assessment of a structure. Several types of numerical models of RC frame
   elements are available in nonlinear structural analysis packages.
   Because the numerical models are formulated based on different
   assumptions and theories, the models' accuracy, computing time, and
   applicability vary, which poses a great difficulty to practicing
   engineers and limits their confidence in the analysis results. In this
   study, the applicability of five representative numerical models of RC
   frame elements is evaluated through comparison with 320 experimental
   results available from the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research
   column database. The accuracy of a numerical model is evaluated
   according to its initial stiffness, peak strength, and energy
   dissipation capacity of the global responses. In addition, a parametric
   study of a cantilever RC column subjected to earthquake excitation is
   carried out to systematically evaluate the consequence of the adopted
   numerical models on the maximum inelastic structural responses. It is
   found from this study that the accuracy of the numerical models is
   sensitive to shear force demand-capacity ratio. If a structural period
   is short and the structure is shear critical, the use of numerical
   models that can explicitly capture the shear deformation and failure is
   suggested. If the structural period is long, the selection of a
   numerical model does not greatly influence the global response of the
   structure. The paper also presents statistical parameters of each
   numerical model, which can be used for probabilistic seismic performance
   assessment. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{The influence of milling time on the powder packing characteristics and
   compressive mechanical properties of a biomedical Ti-10Nb-3Mo alloy
   (wt.\%) was investigated. Ball milling was performed on elemental metal
   powders at different milling times of 0 (blended), 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 h.
   This article demonstrates that despite the beneficial effects of ball
   milling technique in the mechanical alloying of the Ti-based alloy, the
   ball-milled powders synthesized at longer milling times can adversely
   affect the packing density and significantly diminish the compressive
   mechanical properties of the sintered powders. Crown Copyright (C) 2014

Title = {{Designing Truthful Spectrum Auctions for Multi-hop Secondary Networks}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{316-327}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Opportunistic wireless channel access granted to non-licensed users
   through auctions represents a promising approach for effectively
   distributing and utilizing the scarce wireless spectrum. A limitation of
   existing spectrum auction designs lies in the over-simplifying
   assumption that every non-licensed secondary user is a single node or
   single-hop network. For the first time in the literature, we propose to
   model non-licensed users as secondary networks (SNs), each of which
   comprises of a multihop network with end-to-end routing demands. We use
   simple examples to show that such auctions among SNs differ drastically
   from simple auctions among single-hop users, and previous solutions
   suffer from local, per-hop decision making. We first design a simple,
   heuristic auction that takes inter-SN interference into consideration
   and is truthful. We then design a randomized auction framework based on
   primal-dual linear optimization, which is automatically truthful and
   achieves a social welfare approximation ratio that matches one achieved
   by cooperative optimization assuming truthful bids for free. The
   framework relieves a spectrum auction designer from worrying about
   truthfulness of the auction, so that he or she can focus on social
   welfare maximization while assuming truthful bids for free.}},

Title = {{Dynamic rock tests using split Hopkinson (Kolsky) bar system - A review}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND GEOTECHNICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{27-59}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic properties of rocks are important in a variety of rock mechanics
   and rock engineering problems. Due to the transient nature of the
   loading, dynamic tests of rock materials are very different from and
   much more challenging than their static counterparts. Dynamic tests are
   usually conducted using the split Hopkinson bar or Kolsky bar systems,
   which include both split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) and split
   Hopkinson tension bar (SHTB) systems. Significant progress has been made
   on the quantification of various rock dynamic properties, owing to the
   advances in the experimental techniques of SHPB system. This review aims
   to fully describe and critically assess the detailed procedures and
   principles of techniques for dynamic rock tests using split Hopkinson
   bars. The history and principles of SHPB are outlined, followed by the
   key loading techniques that are useful for dynamic rock tests with SHPB
   (i.e. pulse shaping, momentum-trap and multi-axial loading techniques).
   Various measurement techniques for rock tests in SHPB (i.e. X-ray micro
   computed tomography (CT), laser gap gauge (LGG), digital image
   correlation (DIC), Moire method, caustics method, photoelastic coating
   method, dynamic infrared thermography) are then discussed. As the main
   objective of the review, various dynamic measurement techniques for
   rocks using SHPB are described, including dynamic rock strength
   measurements (i.e. dynamic compression, tension, bending and shear
   tests), dynamic fracture measurements (i.e. dynamic imitation and
   propagation fracture toughness, dynamic fracture energy and fracture
   velocity), and dynamic techniques for studying the influences of
   temperature and pore water. (C) 2015 Institute of Rock and Soil

Abstract = {{Background: This study examines the backscattered ultrasound (US) and
   back-propagating photoacoustic (PA) signals from trabecular bones, and
   their variations with reduction in bone minerals and collagen content.
   While the collagen status is directly related to the strength of the
   bone, diagnosis of its condition using US remains a challenge.
   Methods: For both PA and US methods, coded-excitation signals and
   matched filtering were utilized to provide high sensitivity of the
   detected signal. The optical source was a 805-nm CW laser and signals
   were detected employing a 2.2-MHz ultrasonic transducer. Bone
   decalcification and decollagenization were induced with mild
   ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and sodium hypochlorite
   solutions, respectively.
   Results: The PA and US signals were measured on cattle bones, and
   apparent integrated backscatter/backpropagating (AIB) parameters were
   compared before and after demineralization and decollagenization.
   Conclusions: The results show that both PA and US are sensitive to
   mineral changes. In addition, PA is also sensitive changes.}},

Title = {{Illness Progression, Recent Stress, and Morphometry of Hippocampal

Volume = {{77}},

Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Longitudinal studies of illness progression in patients with
   major depressive disorder (MDD) indicate that the onset of subsequent
   depressive episodes becomes increasingly decoupled from external
   stressors. A possible mechanism underlying this phenomenon is that
   multiple episodes induce long-lasting neurobiological changes that
   confer increased risk for recurrence. Prior morphometric studies have
   frequently reported volumetric reductions in patients with
   MDD-especially in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and the
   hippocampus-but few studies have investigated whether these changes are
   exacerbated by prior episodes.
   METHODS: In a sample of 103 medication-free patients with depression and
   control subjects with no history of depression, structural magnetic
   resonance imaging was performed to examine relationships between number
   of prior episodes, current stress, hippocampal subfield volume and
   cortical thickness. Volumetric analyses of the hippocampus were
   performed using a recently validated subfield segmentation approach, and
   cortical thickness estimates were obtained using vertex-based methods.
   Participants were grouped on the basis of the number of prior depressive
   episodes and current depressive diagnosis.
   RESULTS: Number of prior episodes was associated with both lower
   reported stress levels and reduced volume in the dentate gyrus. Cortical
   thinning of the left mPFC was associated with a greater number of prior
   depressive episodes but not current depressive diagnosis.
   CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these findings are consistent with
   preclinical models suggesting that the dentate gyrus and mPFC are
   especially vulnerable to stress exposure and provide evidence for
   morphometric changes that are consistent with stress-sensitization
   models of recurrence in MDD.}},

Abstract = {{Development of a super sound absorbing fixture to damp acoustic energy
   of sound wave over a wide range of frequencies, while occupying the
   least amount of space is of great interest to various industries. A
   broadband absorption effect can be achieved by appropriately grading the
   cell structure of a porous layer to enhance acoustic properties based on
   the specific application. Such porous structures with microstructural
   gradation are called functionally graded materials. A novel graded
   bio-based foam structure is presented with enhanced sound absorption
   capability compared to uniform foams of the same porosity with 20 \%
   increase of maximum acoustic absorption coefficient and 9 \% increase in
   average absorption. In addition, foams with different cell sizes and
   cell distributions were fabricated and characterized for acoustic and
   mechanical performance to investigate the effect of microstructure of
   open-cell foams on the macroscopic properties. Among the uniformly
   distributed cells, cell size of 380 mu m illustrates the highest average
   absorption. The correspondence between sound absorption of open-cell
   foams under study to cell size indicates the importance of understanding
   the effect of microstructure on acoustic behavior of porous-condensed
   matter to determine the ideal cell size/arrangement and reach the
   engineering design with optimum performance for any specific
   application.}},

Title = {{Mechanical properties of partially damaged structural steel induced by

Abstract = {{In structural engineering practice, understanding the behaviour of steel
   under extreme loading conditions is essential for accurate prediction of
   material response when subjected to a combination of severe load
   scenarios such as collision by heavy objects and a following fire.
   Hitherto, the combined effects of high strain loading and subsequent
   elevated temperature have not been widely investigated on the mechanical
   properties of structural steel. A comprehensive test program is carried
   out to investigate the post-impact fire properties of Grade 350 steel
   under well-defined conditions, the results of which are reported in this
   paper. Coupon specimens have undergone interrupting high strain rate
   (HSR) tensile loading at impact level, controlled locally at different
   levels of elongation, to account for different deformation states. Three
   different damage levels are introduced with respect to the displacement
   corresponding to the ultimate stress (A). Subsequently, the partly
   damaged specimens are subjected to steady-state quasi-static tensile
   loading to failure at temperatures ranging from ambient to 600 degrees
   C. The overall stress strain relationship, as well as the mechanical
   properties of pre-damaged steel, are presented at elevated temperatures
   and compared to those of each individual loading scenario. The test
   results demonstrate that the effects of these combined actions are
   profoundly different from those in which the structure is subjected to
   either high strain rate or thermal loading individually. It is shown
   that the strength and ductility of mild steel is significantly dependent
   on the rate of loading, the pre-deformation history and the temperature
   to which it is subsequently exposed. This necessitates the development
   of models which take into account the coupled effect of high strain rate
   and temperature in rational fire analysis and design of steel
   structures. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bubble and dew point data are essential for many practical applications,
   and particularly the safe pipeline transport of post-capture CO2 which
   contain impurities. These mixtures show highly composition specific
   phase properties, necessitating much more experimental data and
   motivating more rapid and inexpensive measurement methods. Here we
   demonstrate a responsive small-scale pressure volume-temperature (PVT)
   cell system enabled by thin-film interference, and its application to an
   industrially-relevant post-capture CO2 mixture stream. The small (5 mL)
   volume is one-to-two orders of magnitude faster to equilibrate than
   conventional PVT cells with viewing windows. Inside the cell, top and
   bottom optical fiber sensors detect bubble and dew points, respectively.
   At vapor-liquid transition points, the reflection spectrum from the
   optical fiber tips report clear interference patterns caused by a thin
   film on the sensor. In addition to sharply delineating the phase change
   condition, the sensor also reports the real time thickness of the film
   (accuracy on the order of 1 mu m). The method is validated with the well
   characterized pure CO2 test case (average error of 2.8 bar as compared
   to NIST data), and applied to an industrially-relevant CO2 stream,
   characteristic of post-capture oxyfuel combustion - an important source
   for downstream CO2 utilization and storage. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {{Effects of topological point reconstructions on the fracture strength
   and deformation mechanisms of graphene}},
Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL MATERIALS SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{97}},
Pages = {{172-180}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Recent experimental studies have identified a number of topological
   reconstructions of point defects in graphene, however, their influence
   on fracture strength has not been studied. From a weakest-link
   perspective, each of these defects are potentially strength-limiting
   features, necessitating investigation of their effects on mechanical
   properties. In the present study, molecular dynamics tensile simulations
   are performed to quantify the strengths of single and divacancy
   topological reconstructions with consideration of temperature and strain
   rate effects. Fracture strengths in the range of 92-101 GPa are obtained
   for the topological reconstructions at 300 K and a strain rate of
   10(9)/s. This range shifts to 81-95 GPa when the loading rate is
   decreased to 5 x 10(6)/s, highlighting the significant influence of
   kinetic factors on fracture strength. Similarly, an increase in
   temperature causes appreciable strength reductions, resulting in
   fracture strengths of 87-97 GPa at 450 K and a 10(9)/s strain rate. In
   order to provide a meaningful comparison to the limited experimental
   data available, the energy barriers for fracture are determined from
   thermal activation theory. Analytical calculations predict fracture
   strengths in the range of 50-79 GPa at 300 K and 10(0)/s, which agrees
   well with experimental reports. Surprisingly, the topological point
   reconstructions with under-coordinated atoms and highest potential
   energies are found to be the strongest defects. Physically,
   under-coordinated atoms are observed to undergo bond rotations, enabling
   a deformation accommodation mechanism that suppress brittle fracture and
   leads to improved flaw tolerance. This finding is supported by Quantized
   Fracture Mechanics calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights

Title = {{A numerical scheme for investigating the effect of bimodal structure on
   acoustic behavior of polylactide foams}},
Journal = {{APPLIED ACOUSTICS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{88}},
Pages = {{75-83}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In order to understand the acoustic behavior of porous membranes, there
   is a need to further investigate the link between microstructure and
   macroscopic properties of such materials. This study presents the sound
   absorption properties of a novel bimodal foam structure made of
   polylactide (PLA) with an interconnected network of pores and micropores
   of very different characteristic sizes, fabricated utilizing the blend
   of PLA and polyethylene glycol (PEG) water soluble polymer. Fabricated
   foams are bio-based and have the advantage of resolving the
   environmental concerns raised by petrochemical based sound absorbers.
   The purpose of this study is to develop bio-based open cell structures
   as a practical solution to today's needs for noise control resolutions.
   Acoustic performance of the bimodal PLA foams is studied by measuring
   the normal incident absorption coefficient and the effect of bimodal
   structure is investigated in terms of acoustic properties (i.e., sound
   absorption) and non-acoustic properties associated to the
   Johnson-Champoux-Allard model (i.e., porosity, airflow resistivity,
   tortuosity, ... ). Inverse method based on JCA model and impedance tube
   measurements for normal incident absorption coefficient was applied to
   estimate tortuosity and characteristic lengths. Results of inverse
   method are in good agreement with direct measurements of normal incident
   absorption coefficient. While tortuosity increases by increasing the
   polymer weight percent, it remains constant as the secondary porous
   structure extends in the porous medium. As the bimodal structure extends
   through the foam, both thermal and viscous characteristic lengths
   increase for different foam categories. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Automotive polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells are exposed to
   high magnitude road-induced impact loads and vibrations as well as
   high-level cyclic stresses due to humidity and temperature

   two-dimensional finite element model based on cohesive zone theory was
   employed to investigate the combined effects of hygrothermal cycle
   amplitude and amplitude and frequency of external vibrations on damage
   propagation. The simultaneous presence of hygrothermal cycles and
   vibrations severely intensified damage propagation within the expected
   fuel cell lifetime. Compared with applied vibrations, hygrothermal
   cycles produced a dominating effect on degradation. Under hygrothermal
   cycling, membrane cracks experienced more severe propagation compared to
   delaminations, while vibrations had a more significant effect on
   delaminations compared to cracks. The presence of a channel offset led
   to a 2.5-fold increase in delamination length compared to a case with no
   channel offset. Copyright (C) 2014, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

Abstract = {{Triarylamines are a well-established family of organic semiconductors.
   Recently, we have attached short silicone chains to these molecules to
   alter their mechanical properties. The resulting compounds are liquids
   at room temperature. We have undertaken to confirm the suitability of
   these molecules for use in thin film flexible devices. One fundamental
   property of semiconductors is the charge carrier mobility, which
   provides a quantitative estimate for how rapidly charge percolates
   through a material. The charge carrier mobility for a series of six
   recently developed liquid siliconized triarylamines was measured using
   time-of-flight spectroscopy (TOF). In order to evaluate the effect of
   glass transition temperature on mobility, TOF was performed for
   different electric fields at temperatures above and below the glass
   transition temperature. Mobilities were found to compare favorably to
   the charge carrier mobilities of conventional nonliquid triarylamines.
   It was further observed that the mobilities conform to the predictions
   of the disorder formalism for a disordered solid both above and below
   the glass transition temperature. This suggests that charge transport is
   dominated by thermally activated intermolecular hopping rather than by
   any convective or diffusive mass transport within the liquid phase.}},

Abstract = {{Non-specific adsorption of biomolecules (or biofouling) is a major
   problem in microfluidics and many other applications. The problem is
   particularly pernicious in digital microfluidics (DMF, a technique in
   which droplets are manipulated electrodynamically on an array of
   electrodes coated with a hydrophobic insulator), as local increases in
   surface energy that arise from fouling can cause droplet movement to
   fail. We report a new solution to this problem: a device coating bearing
   a combination of fluorinated poly(ethylene glycol) functionalities
   (FPEG) and perfluorinated methacrylate (FA) moieties. A range of
   different FPEG-FA copolymers were synthesized containing varying amounts
   of FPEG relative to the fluorinated backbone. Coatings with low\%FPEG
   were found to result in significant reductions in protein adsorption and
   improvements in device lifetime (up to 5.5-fold) relative to the state
   of the art. An analysis of surface topology and chemistry suggests that
   FPEG-FA surfaces undergo a dynamic reconstruction upon activation by
   applying DMF driving potentials, with FPEG groups forming vertical
   protrusions out of the plane of the device surface. An analysis of
   changes in surface wettability and adhesion as a function of activation
   supports this hypothesis. This innovation represents an advance for
   digital microfluidics, and may also find use in other applications that
   are currently limited by biofouling.}},

Abstract = {{Nerve injuries cause pain, paralysis and numbness that can lead to major
   disability, and newborns often sustain nerve injuries during delivery
   that result in lifelong impairment. Without a pharmacologic agent to
   enhance functional recovery from these injuries, clinicians rely solely
   on surgery and rehabilitation to treat patients. Unfortunately, patient
   outcomes remain poor despite application of the most advanced
   microsurgical and rehabilitative techniques. We hypothesized that the
   detrimental effects of traumatic neonatal nerve injury could be
   mitigated with pharmacologic neuroprotection, and tested whether the
   novel neuroprotective agent P7C3 would block peripheral neuron cell
   death and enhance functional recovery in a rat neonatal nerve injury
   model. Administration of P7C3 after sciatic nerve crush injury doubled
   motor and sensory neuron survival, and also promoted axon regeneration
   in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with P7C3 also enhanced behavioral
   and muscle functional recovery, and reversed pathological mobilization
   of spinal microglia after injury. Our findings suggest that the P7C3
   family of neuroprotective compounds may provide a basis for the
   development of a new neuroprotective drug to enhance recovery following
   peripheral nerve injury. (C) 2014 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Complex morphology of open cell porous media makes it difficult to link
   microstructural parameters and acoustic behavior of these materials.
   While morphology determines the overall sound absorption and noise
   damping effectiveness of a porous structure, little is known on the
   influence of microstructural configuration on the macroscopic
   properties. In the present research, a novel bimodal porous structure
   was designed and developed solely for modeling purposes. For the
   developed porous structure, it is possible to have direct control on
   morphological parameters and avoid complications raised by intricate
   pore geometries. A semi-empirical model is developed to relate
   microstructural parameters to macroscopic characteristics of porous
   material using precise characterization results based on the designed
   bimodal porous structures. This model specifically links macroscopic
   parameters including static airflow resistivity (sigma), thermal
   characteristic length (Lambda'), viscous characteristic length (Lambda),
   and dynamic tortuosity (alpha(infinity)) to microstructural factors such
   as cell wall thickness (2t) and reticulation rate (R-w). The developed
   model makes it possible to design the morphology of porous media to
   achieve optimum sound absorption performance based on the application in
   hand. This study makes the base for understanding the role of
   microstructural geometry and morphological factors on the overall
   macroscopic parameters of porous materials specifically for acoustic
   capabilities. The next step is to include other microstructural
   parameters as well to generalize the developed model. In the present
   paper, pore size was kept constant for eight categories of bimodal foams
   to study the effect of secondary porous structure on macroscopic
   properties and overall acoustic behavior of porous media. (C) 2015 AIP

Title = {{Alkaline Extraction of Xylan from Wood Using Microwave and Conventional
   Heating}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},

Abstract = {{This study aims to investigate the effect of microwave heating versus
   conventional heating for the alkaline hydrolysis of xylan from birch
   wood to understand the effect of the heating process on the dissolution
   of wood, the yield of xylan, and the degree of polymerization of the
   isolated xylan. The results indicate that the rate of wood dissolution
   is significantly higher (0.020/s) during microwave extraction than the
   conventional extraction (0.001/s). Wood solubilization, after an initial
   rapid removal of damaged fibers, is linear with time for both
   conventional and microwave extraction, with microwave showing a rate 20
   times faster. The yield of xylan reaches a limit of about 60\% for both
   processes but then declines slowly as thermal degradation become
   significant. Microwave heating provides 60\% yield in 1/10th the time of
   the conventional process. This is found to be associated with the rapid
   temperature rise, and also with local hot spots generated during
   microwave treatment. The results indicated that xylan degradation was
   significant above 95 degrees C. The nature of the isolated xylan was
   different for the two heating methods: the xylan isolated using
   microwave extraction for 20 min exhibits higher molecular weight (i.e.,
   a greater degree of polymerization, about 150) than the xylan isolated
   using conventional extraction for the same duration (degree of
   polymerization, about 124) demonstrating the effectiveness of microwave
   heating for extraction of xylan from wood. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals,

Title = {{Avoiding 40\% of the premature deaths in each country, 2010-30: review
   of national mortality trends to help quantify the UN Sustainable
   Development Goal for health}},
Journal = {{LANCET}},

Month = {{JAN 17}},
Abstract = {{Background The UN will formulate ambitious Sustainable Development Goals
   for 2030, including one for health. Feasible goals with some
   quantifiable, measurable targets can influence governments. We propose,
   as a quatitative health target, ``Avoid in each country 40\% of
   premature deaths (under-70 deaths that would be seen in the 2030
   population at 2010 death rates), and improve health care at all
   ages{''}. Targeting overall mortality and improved health care ignores
   no modifiable cause of death, nor any cause of disability that is
   treatable (or also causes many deaths). 40\% fewer premature deaths
   would be important in all countries, but implies very different
   priorities in different populations. Reinforcing this target for overall
   mortality in each country are four global subtargets for 2030: avoid
   two-thirds of child and maternal deaths; two-thirds of tuberculosis,
   HIV, and malaria deaths; a third of premature deaths from
   non-communicable diseases (NCDs); and a third of those from other causes
   (other communicable diseases, undernutrition, and injuries). These
   challenging subtargets would halve under-50 deaths, avoid a third of the
   (mainly NCD) deaths at ages 50-69 years, and so avoid 40\% of under-70
   deaths. To help assess feasibility, we review mortality rates and trends
   in the 25 most populous countries, in four country income groupings, and
   worldwide.
   Methods UN sources yielded overall 1970-2010 mortality trends. WHO
   sources yielded cause-specific 2000-10 trends, standardised to
   country-specific 2030 populations; decreases per decade of 42\% or 18\%
   would yield 20-year reductions of two-thirds or a third.
   Results Throughout the world, except in countries where the effects of
   HIV or political disturbances predominated, mortality decreased
   substantially from 1970-2010, particularly in childhood. From 2000-10,
   under-70 age-standardised mortality rates decreased 19\% (with the
   low-income and lower-middle-income countries having the greatest
   absolute gains). The proportional decreases per decade (2000-10) were:
   34\% at ages 0-4 years; 17\% at ages 5-49 years; 15\% at ages 50-69
   years; 30\% for communicable, perinatal, maternal, or nutritional
   causes; 14\% for NCDs; and 13\% for injuries (accident, suicide, or
   homicide).
   Interpretation Moderate acceleration of the 2000-10 proportional
   decreases in mortality could be feasible, achieving the targeted 2030
   disease-specific reductions of two-thirds or a third. If achieved, these
   reductions avoid about 10 million of the 20 million deaths at ages 0-49
   years that would be seen in 2030 at 2010 death rates, and about 17
   million of the 41 million such deaths at ages 0-69 years. Such changes
   could be achievable by 2030, or soon afterwards, at least in areas free
   of war, other major effects of political disruption, or a major new
   epidemic.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) alignment on

   consists of the Lennard-Jones potential of Van der Waals interaction
   between CNTs and the bending energy of CNT walls. Simulation results
   show better agreement with experimental data by the newly development.
   The current study reveals the anisotropy of electrical property of
   aligned CNT/polymer composites is mainly affected by the average
   conductive pathway density of CNTs, which depends heavily on CNT
   alignment structure. The study further identifies that the aligned CNT
   structure in polymer matrix effectively affects the contributions of

   were reduced and carburized simultaneously by carbon monoxide (CO) at
   temperatures up to 950 degrees C. ICP and FTIR along with XRD analyses
   were conducted on the residual solution and powders to investigate the
   precipitation mechanism. The effect of precursor solution pH on the
   chemical and morphological uniformity of the powders process was
   investigated; the optimum value was determined as similar to 13. The ICP
   analysis of the remained solution after co-precipitation indicated
   almost complete extraction of Ni and W into the precipitates. Proper
   temperatures for calcination in air, and simultaneous reduction and
   carburizing in CO were determined through TGA analysis; 550 degrees C
   and 950 degrees C respectively. SEM observation of the material in
   various steps revealed nano-sized particles in all of them, along with
   fine distribution of Ni and W elements. XRD analysis of the calcine
   sample showed the presence of WO3 and NiWO4 and the same analysis for
   the reduced and carburized sample confirmed the formation of WC and Ni.

Abstract = {{In this work, we study the spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of
   discrete solitons in two-component waveguide arrays with long-range
   linearly coupled effect. Stable symmetry and asymmetry two-component
   discrete solitons are found in the system. The symmetry transition
   between them are studied. We find that, increasing the strength of the
   linear long-range coupling, the process of the symmetry breaking from
   the symmetric soliton to the asymmetric soliton will switch from
   supercritical to subcritical type. The specific switch point is
   identified by numerical simulations. Compared to the case with nonlinear
   long-range couplings, the SSB with linear long-range coupling is
   opposite in behavior. These findings can help to fill the gap in our
   general picture of the symmetry breaking against nonlocal effects, and
   may possible have potential applications in optical communications and
   all-optical networks.}},

Title = {{Temporal alignment of electrocorticographic recordings for upper limb
   movement}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 13}},
Abstract = {{The detection of movement-related components of the brain activity is
   useful in the design of brain-machine interfaces. A common approach is
   to classify the brain activity into a number of templates or states. To
   find these templates, the neural responses are averaged over each
   movement task. For averaging to be effective, one must assume that the
   neural components occur at identical times over repeated trials.
   However, complex arm movements such as reaching and grasping are prone
   to cross-trial variability due to the way movements are performed.
   Typically initiation time, duration of movement and movement speed are
   variable even as a subject tries to reproduce the same task identically
   across trials. Therefore, movement-related neural activity will tend to
   occur at different times across the trials. Due to this mismatch, the
   averaging of neural activity will not bring into salience
   movement-related components. To address this problem, we present a
   method of alignment that accounts for the variabilities in the way the
   movements are conducted. In this study, arm speed was used to align
   neural activity. Four subjects had electrocorticographic (ECoG)
   electrodes implanted over their primary motor cortex and were asked to
   perform reaching and retrieving tasks using the upper limb contralateral
   to the site of electrode implantation. The arm speeds were aligned using
   a non-linear transformation of the temporal axes resulting in average
   spectrograms with superior visualization of movement-related neural
   activity when compared to averaging without alignment.}},

Title = {{Mathematical model accurately predicts protein release from an
   affinity-based delivery system}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF CONTROLLED RELEASE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{197}},
Pages = {{69-77}},
Month = {{JAN 10}},
Abstract = {{Affinity-based controlled release modulates the delivery of protein or
   small molecule therapeutics through transient dissociation/association.
   To understand which parameters can be used to tune release, we used a
   mathematical model based on simple binding kinetics. A comprehensive
   asymptotic analysis revealed three characteristic regimes for
   therapeutic release from affinity-based systems. These regimes can be
   controlled by diffusion or unbinding kinetics, and can exhibit release
   over either a single stage or two stages. This analysis fundamentally
   changes the way we think of controlling release from affinity-based
   systems and thereby explains some of the discrepancies in the literature
   on which parameters influence affinity-based release. The rate of
   protein release from affinity-based systems is determined by the balance
   of diffusion of the therapeutic agent through the hydrogel and the
   dissociation kinetics of the affinity pair. Equations for tuning protein
   release rate by altering the strength (K-D) of the affinity interaction,
   the concentration of binding ligand in the system, the rate of
   dissociation (k(off)) of the complex, and the hydrogel size and
   geometry, are provided. We validated our model by collapsing the model
   simulations and the experimental data from a recently described affinity
   release system, to a single master curve. Importantly, this mathematical
   analysis can be applied to any single species affinity-based system to
   determine the parameters required for a desired release profile. (C)

Title = {{Subthreshold membrane currents confer distinct tuning properties that
   enable neurons to encode the integral or derivative of their input}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JAN 9}},
Abstract = {{Neurons rely on action potentials, or spikes, to encode information. But
   spikes can encode different stimulus features in different neurons. We
   show here through simulations and experiments how neurons encode the
   integral or derivative of their input based on the distinct tuning
   properties conferred upon them by subthreshold currents. Slow-activating
   subthreshold inward (depolarizing) current mediates positive feedback
   control of subthreshold voltage, sustaining depolarization and allowing
   the neuron to spike on the basis of its integrated stimulus waveform.
   Slow-activating subthreshold outward (hyperpolarizing) current mediates
   negative feedback control of subthreshold voltage, truncating
   depolarization and forcing the neuron to spike on the basis of its
   differentiated stimulus waveform. Depending on its direction,
   slow-activating subthreshold current cooperates or competes with
   fast-activating inward current during spike initiation. This explanation
   predicts that sensitivity to the rate of change of stimulus intensity
   differs qualitatively between integrators and differentiators. This was
   confirmed experimentally in spinal sensory neurons that naturally behave
   as specialized integrators or differentiators. Predicted sensitivity to
   different stimulus features was confirmed by covariance analysis.
   Integration and differentiation, which are themselves inverse
   operations, are thus shown to be implemented by the slow feedback
   mediated by oppositely directed subthreshold currents expressed in
   different neurons.}},

Abstract = {{Catabolism of host cholesterol is critical to the virulence of
   Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is a potential target for novel
   therapeutics. KstR2, a TetR family repressor (TFR), regulates the
   expression of 15 genes encoding enzymes that catabolize the last half of
   the cholesterol molecule, represented by 3a alpha-H-4
   alpha(3'-propanoate)-7a beta -methylhexahydro-1,5-indane-dione (HIP).
   Binding of KstR2 to its operator sequences is relieved upon binding of
   HIP-CoA. A 1.6-angstrom resolution crystal structure of the
   KstR2(Mtb)center dot HIP-CoA complex reveals that the KstR2(Mtb) dimer
   accommodates two molecules of HIP-CoA. Each ligand binds in an elongated
   cleft spanning the dimerization interface such that the HIP and CoA
   moieties interact with different KstR2(Mtb) protomers. In isothermal
   titration calorimetry studies, the dimer bound 2 eq of HIP-CoA with high
   affinity (K-d = 80 +/- 10 n(M)) but bound neither HIP nor CoASH.
   Substitution of Arg-162 or Trp-166, residues that interact,
   respectively, with the diphosphate and HIP moieties of HIP-CoA,
   dramatically decreased the affinity of KstR2(Mtb) for HIP-CoA but not
   for its operator sequence. The variant of R162M that decreased the
   affinity for HIP-CoA (Delta Delta G = 13 kJ mol(-1)) is consistent with
   the loss of three hydrogen bonds as indicated in the structural data. A
   24-bp operator sequence bound two dimers of KstR2. Structural
   comparisons with a ligand-free rhodococcal homologue and a DNA-bound
   homologue suggest that HIP-CoA induces conformational changes of the
   DNA-binding domains of the dimer that preclude their proper positioning
   in the major groove of DNA. The results provide insight into
   KstR2-mediated regulation of expression of steroid catabolic genes and
   the determinants of ligand binding in TFRs.}},

Abstract = {{To facilitate precision medicine and whole-genome annotation, we
   developed a machine-learning technique that scores how strongly genetic
   variants affect RNA splicing, whose alteration contributes to many
   diseases. Analysis of more than 650,000 intronic and exonic variants
   revealed widespread patterns of mutation-driven aberrant splicing.
   Intronic disease mutations that are more than 30 nucleotides from any
   splice site alter splicing nine times as often as common variants, and
   missense exonic disease mutations that have the least impact on protein
   function are five times as likely as others to alter splicing. We
   detected tens of thousands of disease-causing mutations, including those
   involved in cancers and spinal muscular atrophy. Examination of intronic
   and exonic variants found using whole-genome sequencing of individuals
   with autism revealed misspliced genes with neurodevelopmental
   phenotypes. Our approach provides evidence for causal variants and
   should enable new discoveries in precision medicine.}},

Abstract = {{This paper reports the first study of stiffness/deformability changes of
   lymphocytes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients,
   demonstrating that at the single cell level, leukemic metastasis
   progresses are accompanied by biophysical property alterations. A
   microfluidic device was utilized to electrically measure cell volume and
   transit time of single lymphocytes from healthy and CLL patients. The
   results from testing thousands of cells reveal that lymphocytes from CLL
   patients have higher stiffness (i.e., lower deformability), as compared
   to lymphocytes in healthy samples, which was also confirmed by AFM
   indentation tests. This observation is in sharp contrast to the known
   knowledge on other types of metastatic cells (e.g., breast and lung
   cancer cells) whose stiffness becomes lower as metastasis progresses.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCED HEALTHCARE MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{4}},
Number = {{1}},

Abstract = {{To replace damaged or diseased tissues, large tissue-engineered
   constructs can be prepared by assembling modular components in a
   bottom-up approach. However, a high-speed method is needed to produce
   sufficient numbers of these modules for full-sized tissue substitutes.
   To this end, a novel production technique is devised, combining air
   shearing and a plug flow reactor-style design to rapidly produce large
   quantities of hydrogel-based (here type I collagen) cylindrical modular
   components with tunable diameters and length. Using this technique,
   modules containing NIH 3T3 cells show greater than 95\% viability while
   endothelial cell surface attachment and confluent monolayer formation
   are demonstrated. Additionally, the rapidly produced modules are used to
   assemble large tissue constructs (>1 cm(3)) in vitro. Module building
   blocks containing luciferase-expressing L929 cells are packed in full
   size adult rat-liver-shaped bioreactors and perfused with cell medium,
   to demonstrate the capacity to build organ-shaped constructs;
   bioluminescence demonstrates sustained viability over 3 d.
   Cardiomyocyte-embedded modules are also used to assemble electrically
   stimulatable contractile tissue.}},

Title = {{Effect of material property heterogeneity on biomechanical modeling of

Journal = {{PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{60}},
Number = {{1}},

Month = {{JAN 7}},
Abstract = {{Biomechanical model based deformable image registration has been widely
   used to account for prostate deformation in various medical imaging
   procedures. Biomechanical material properties are important components
   of a biomechanical model. In this study, the effect of incorporating
   tumor-specific material properties in the prostate biomechanical model
   was investigated to provide insight into the potential impact of
   material heterogeneity on the prostate deformation calculations. First,
   a simple spherical prostate and tumor model was used to analytically
   describe the deformations and demonstrate the fundamental effect of
   changes in the tumor volume and stiffness in the modeled deformation.
   Next, using a clinical prostate model, a parametric approach was used to
   describe the variations in the heterogeneous prostate model by changing
   tumor volume, stiffness, and location, to show the differences in the
   modeled deformation between heterogeneous and homogeneous prostate
   models. Finally, five clinical prostatectomy examples were used in
   separately performed homogeneous and heterogeneous biomechanical model
   based registrations to describe the deformations between 3D
   reconstructed histopathology images and ex vivo magnetic resonance
   imaging, and examine the potential clinical impact of modeling
   biomechanical heterogeneity of the prostate. The analytical formulation
   showed that increasing the tumor volume and stiffness could
   significantly increase the impact of the heterogeneous prostate model in
   the calculated displacement differences compared to the homogeneous
   model. The parametric approach using a single prostate model indicated
   up to 4.8 mm of displacement difference at the tumor boundary compared
   to a homogeneous model. Such differences in the deformation of the
   prostate could be potentially clinically significant given the voxel
   size of the ex vivo MR images (0.3 x 0.3 x 0.3 mm). However, no
   significant changes in the registration accuracy were observed using
   heterogeneous models for the limited number of clinical prostatectomy
   patients modeled and evaluated in this study.}},

Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{102}},
Month = {{JAN 6}},
Abstract = {{The mechanical properties of extracellular matrix proteins strongly
   influence cell-induced tension in the matrix, which in turn influences
   cell function. Despite progress on the impact of elastic behaviour of
   matrix proteins on cell-matrix interactions, little is known about the
   influence of inelastic behaviour, especially at the large and slow
   deformations that characterize cell-induced matrix remodelling. We found
   that collagen matrices exhibit deformation rate-dependent behaviour,
   which leads to a transition from pronounced elastic behaviour at fast
   deformations to substantially inelastic behaviour at slow deformations
   (1 mu m min(-1), similar to cell-mediated deformation). With slow
   deformations, the inelastic behaviour of floating gels was sensitive to
   collagen concentration, whereas attached gels exhibited similar
   inelastic behaviour independent of collagen concentration. The presence
   of an underlying rigid support had a similar effect on cell-matrix
   interactions: cell-induced deformation and remodelling were similar on 1
   or 3 mg ml(-1) attached collagen gels while deformations were two-to
   fourfold smaller in floating gels of high compared with low collagen
   concentration. In cross-linked collagen matrices, which did not exhibit
   inelastic behaviour, cells did not respond to the presence of the
   underlying rigid foundation. These data indicate that at the slow rates
   of collagen compaction generated by fibroblasts, the inelastic responses
   of collagen gels, which are influenced by collagen concentration and the
   presence of an underlying rigid foundation, are important determinants
   of cell-matrix interactions and mechanosensation.}},

Abstract = {{The analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is an important
   capability that may lead to new approaches for cancer management. CTC
   capture devices developed to date isolate a bulk population of CTCs and
   do not differentiate subpopulations that may have varying phenotypes
   with different levels of clinical relevance. Here, we present a new
   device for CTC spatial sorting and profiling that sequesters blood-borne
   tumor cells with different phenotypes into discrete spatial bins.
   Validation data are presented showing that cancer cell lines with
   varying surface expression generate different binning profiles within
   the device. Working with patient blood samples, we obtain profiles that
   elucidate the heterogeneity of CTC populations present in cancer
   patients and also report on the status of CTCs within the
   epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT).}},

Abstract = {{The perfect regulation problem with bounded peaking refers to the design
   of controllers which can regulate the output of a system arbitrarily

   lower bounds on the dynamic order. The result is a one parameter family

Abstract = {{The reach control problem (RCP) deals with finding a feedback control
   which drives the states of an affine control system to leave a simplex

   continuous feedback stabilization, a topological obstruction to solving
   the RCP by continuous feedback results in a deep necessary condition for
   solvability. In this paper, we interpret the problem of topological
   obstruction as a problem of existence of null-homotopic maps on spheres.
   This results in a complete and easily implementable characterization of
   the topological obstruction for the case of systems with two inputs.}},

Abstract = {{In distributed systems, a common question is how to synthesize a control
   law that adheres to the system's distributed interconnection structure.
   One promising synthesis approach involves encoding the system's
   interconnections as a pattern in the system matrices, and carrying this
   pattern through all steps of a control design. To date, though, all
   control results on this front have had limitations on which distributed
   structures are admissible. In this paper, we provide a pole placement
   result that is valid for more general system patterns. We also show that
   a system's controllability does not imply patterned pole placement, so
   we introduce a novel notion of controllability for patterned distributed
   systems.}},

Abstract = {{This paper focuses on the optimal operation of water distribution
   networks. We model water distribution networks using physical and
   hydraulic constraints, and formulate a joint pump scheduling and water
   flow problem using the hydraulic characteristics of variable speed
   pumps. The optimal pump scheduling and water flow problem is a mixed
   integer nonlinear program. This problem is generally non-convex, and
   hence NP-hard. We propose a second-order cone relaxation for this
   problem, and analytically show that the proposed relaxation is exact for
   a wide class of water network topologies. The proposed problem is a
   mixed integer nonlinear program with a linear objective function and
   quadratic constraints. This problem can be solved with a commercial
   solver such as CPLEX. Finally, we consider a real-world water network,
   and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed relaxation in
   computing the optimal pump schedules and water flows.}},

Abstract = {{Power consumption analysis is the first step in the process of
   dimensioning the cell size for any mobile network. Therefore, improving
   power utilization emerges as one of the major challenges to the 3rd
   Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long-Term Evolution (LTE) Release
   12 coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception scheme. This
   paper proposes new models for heterogeneous deployment of CoMP
   macrocells overlaid with the emerging neighborhood femtocell network in
   order to meet the power efficiency requirements. Two case studies are
   mathematically analyzed: Firstly, neighborhood femtocells are allocated
   at the macrocell edge line in order to reduce the ultimate range of CoMP
   transmission while coverage is extended using low power femtocell
   transmissions. Secondly, femtocells are deployed at selected CoMP
   intra-cell regions in order to improve neighborhood coverage;
   transmissions are coupled between femtocells and CoMP to provide the
   necessary converge across the cell area and transfer connections from
   macrocell to low power femtocells. A comparative study is performed to
   show the power efficiency obtained through scaling the network area at
   both cell-edge and sub-cell areas. The analysis show new strategies for
   deploying small cells under CoMP macrocell umbrella in order to minimize
   the power consumption figures compared to only macrocell based network.}},

Abstract = {{Signal strength variation across diverse devices is a major problem with
   RSS-based indoor localization systems. This paper aims to solve this
   problem by considering two factors: the instability of collected RSS
   samples and linear shift of RSS patterns collected by different devices.
   We propose different techniques to handle the uncertainty of samples.
   Furthermore, we propose an automatic linear transformation algorithm

   algorithm finds the set of nearest neighbor fingerprints for an online
   point through a series of linear transformations. A localizer engine is
   then used to detect user's location. The proposed system is automatic,
   has low computational complexity and does not require any training

Abstract = {{In heterogeneous cellular networks (HCNs), the interference received at
   a user is correlated over time slots since it comes from the same set of
   randomly located base stations (BSs). This results in the correlations
   of link successes, thus affecting network performance. Under the
   assumptions of a K-tier Poisson network, strongest long-term averaged
   biased-received-power based BS association, and independent Rayleigh
   fading, we first quantify the correlation coefficients of interference.
   We observe that the interference correlation is independent of the
   number of tiers, BS density, signal-to-interference-ratio (SIR)
   threshold, and transmit power. Then, we study the correlations of link
   successes in terms of the joint success probability over multiple time
   slots. We show that analysis without considering the temporal
   interference correlation underestimates the joint success probability.
   Moreover, we explore the effects of BS density, transmit power and user
   association bias on the joint success probability. In particular, BS
   density and transmit power affect the joint success probability of the
   overall network by influencing the association probability of each tier.
   We also reveal that the unbiased cell association outperforms the biased
   cell association in terms of the joint success probability. Finally, we
   conduct simulations to validate our analysis.}},

Abstract = {{Multicast transmission and wireless caching are effective ways of
   reducing air and backhaul traffic load in wireless networks. This paper
   proposes to incorporate these two key ideas for content-centric
   transmission in a cloud radio access network (RAN) where multiple base
   stations (BSs) are connected to a central processor (CP) via
   finite-capacity backhaul links. Each BS has a cache with finite storage
   size and is equipped with multiple antennas. The BSs cooperatively
   transmit contents, either stored in the local cache or fetched from the
   CP, to multiple users in the network. Users requesting a same content
   form a multicast group and are served by a same cluster of BSs
   cooperatively using multicast beamforming. Assuming fixed cache
   placement, this paper investigates the joint design of multicast
   beamforming and content-centric BS clustering by formulating an
   optimization problem of minimizing the total network cost under the
   quality-of-service (QoS) constraints for each multicast group. The
   network cost involves both the transmission power and the backhaul cost.
   We model the backhaul cost using the mixed l(0)/l(2)-norm of beamforming
   vectors. To solve this non-convex problem, we first approximate it using
   the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and concave smooth functions.
   We then propose a difference of convex functions (DC) programming
   algorithm to obtain suboptimal solutions and show the connection of
   three smooth functions. Simulation results validate the advantage of
   multicasting and show the effects of different cache size and caching
   policies in cloud RAN.}},

   identify several ranges of channel parameters where these bounds

   of the presence of an eavesdropper on the capacity. We consider the
   following two scenarios regarding the availability of randomness: 1) a

   randomness is available only at the source and there is no available
   randomness at the relays. We obtain the upper bound by taking into
   account the correlation between the two relay signals and the
   availability of randomness at each encoder. For the lower bound, we
   propose two types of coding schemes: 1) a decode-and-forward scheme
   where the relays cooperatively transmit the message and the fictitious
   message and 2) a partial DF scheme incorporated with multicoding in
   which each relay sends an independent partial message and the whole or

Abstract = {{We study the secure degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) of helper-assisted
   Gaussian wiretap channel with shared key between the transmitter and the
   helper. Given that the rate of the key scales with power as gamma/2 log
   SNR, we show that secure d.o.f. is min \{1+gamma/2, 1\}. The
   achievability proof combines real interference alignment with the
   artificial noise transmission technique. Using the shared key we sample
   common artificial noise symbols from a PAM constellation at the
   transmitter and the helper and transmit them in the null space of the
   legitimate receiver's channel. We further sample independent noise
   symbols, also from the same PAM constellation, at the transmitter and
   the helper and align these symbols at the legitimate receiver. The noise
   symbols together occupy sufficient dimensions to mask the message at the
   eavesdropper. A converse proof, which extends the technique of Xie and
   Ulukus to incorporate common randomness, establishes the optimality of
   secure d.o.f.. We also extend the result to the case with M helpers with
   two different assumptions on the key sharing structure: the transmitter
   shares a common key or distinct keys with the M helpers. The exact
   secure d.o.f.s for these two cases, before they saturate to 1, are
   proved to be M + gamma/M + 1 and M + M gamma/M + 1 respectively.}},

Abstract = {{A standard VLSI model is used to derive universal lower bounds on the
   energy of decoder circuits. In the circuit model used, the product of
   the circuit area and number of clock cycles, or the area-time complexity
   is proportional to the energy of computation. Lower bounds as a function
   of block length n are presented for three different circuit paradigms.
   Firstly, for circuits that compute in parallel, an Omega (n(log n)(1/2))
   scaling rule is shown. Secondly, for circuits that compute serially, an
   Omega (n log n) lower bound is presented. Thirdly, for a sequence of
   decoding circuits in which the number of output pins grows arbitrarily
   with block length, the energy is shown to grow as Omega(n(log n)(1/5)).
   In addition, it is shown that the energy complexity of almost all LDPC
   decoders that can get close to capacity and whose Tanner graphs are
   generated according to a uniform standard configuration model must take
   Omega(n(2)) area to implement directly.}},

   a source sequence, and we are interested in the minimum latency, or
   transmission time, required to serve them all. We first show that for a
   two-user broadcast channel, a point-to-point outer bound can always be
   achieved. For broadcasting to three users, we propose a queue-based
   hybrid digital-analog coding scheme that achieves optimal performance
   for the duration of analog transmissions. We propose a method of
   characterizing the number of analog transmissions that can be sent,

Abstract = {{This paper investigates the compress-and-forward scheme for an uplink
   cloud radio access network (C-RAN) model, where multi-antenna
   base-stations (BSs) are connected to a cloud computing based central
   processor (CP) via capacity-limited fronthaul links. The BSs perform
   Wyner-Ziv coding to compress and send the received signals to the CP;
   the CP performs either joint decoding of both the quantization codewords
   and the user messages at the same time, or the more practical successive
   decoding of the quantization codewords first, then the user messages.
   Under this setup, this paper makes progress toward the optimization of
   the fronthaul compression scheme by proving two results. First, it is
   shown that if the input distributions are assumed to be Gaussian, then
   under joint decoding, the optimal Wyner-Ziv quantization scheme for
   maximizing the achievable rate region is Gaussian. Second, for fixed
   Gaussian input, under a sum fronthaul capacity constraint and assuming
   Gaussian quantization, this paper shows that successive decoding and
   joint decoding achieve the same maximum sum rate. In this case, the
   optimization of Gaussian quantization noise covariance matrices for
   maximizing sum rate can be formulated as a convex optimization problem,
   therefore can be solved efficiently.}},

   erasure channel which captures the temporal correlation in packet losses

   statistical channels such as Gilbert-Elliott channel. In the
   point-to-point case, we provide a new class of codes, Embedded Maximum
   Distance Separable (EMDS) codes, which recovers from channels
   introducing a mixture of burst and isolated erasures. Moreover, we
   propose a technique that extends point-to-point codes for the multicast
   scenario with two receivers that tolerate different delays, T-1 and T-2.
   The multicast codes opportunistically decode packets with short delay
   T-1 when the channel is relatively better and with long delay T-2 when
   the channel is worse. Simulations over multicast Gilbert-Elliott
   channels show that EMDS codes outperform other streaming codes for both
   users.}},

Abstract = {{Alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) decoding is a new
   decoding framework for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. It can be
   used to implement linear programming (LP) decoding or penalized LP
   decoding. Similar to belief propagation (BP) decoding, ADMM decoding
   consists of local ``check{''} and ``variable updates{''}. However, ADMM
   decoding performs better than BP at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).
   To understand why these two locally operating algorithms result in
   different error floor behaviors, we study the dynamics of ADMM decoding
   in this paper. In particular, we focus on trapping sets, which are
   observed to cause error floors in ADMM decoding. Our results show that
   the dynamics of ADMM decoding on trapping sets can be characterized as a
   jump linear system. Furthermore, these results indicate that the
   Lagrange multipliers involved in ADMM play an important role in
   correcting trapping set errors. Finally, we present simulation results
   that support this understanding.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a noisy network coding integrated with partial
   decode-and-forward relaying for single-source multicast discrete
   memoryless networks (DMN's). Our coding scheme generalizes the
   partial-decode-compressand- forward scheme (Theorem 7) by Cover and El
   Gamal. This is the first time the theorem is generalized for DMN's such
   that each relay performs both partial decode-and-forward and
   compress-and-forward simultaneously. Our coding scheme simultaneously
   generalizes both noisy network coding by Lim, Kim, El Gamal, and Chung
   and distributed decode-and-forward by Lim, Kim, and Kim. It is not
   trivial to combine the two schemes because of inherent incompatibility
   in their encoding and decoding strategies. We solve this problem by
   sending the same long message over multiple blocks at the source and at
   the same time by letting the source find the auxiliary covering indices
   that carry information about the message simultaneously over all blocks.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a new fault prediction model for a partially
   observable production system subject to two failure modes, namely a
   catastrophic failure and a failure due to the system degradation. The
   degradation process is described by a three states hidden Markov
   model(HMM). It is assumed that the time to sudden failure is dependent
   on system operating state. The parameter estimation procedure based on
   the Expectation-Maximization(EM) algorithm is developed. Explicit
   formulas for the conditional reliability function and the mean residual
   life are derived in terms of the posterior probability that the system
   is in the warning state. The method is illustrated using simulated data.
   The effectiveness of the proposed HMM to predict failures is then
   compared with the performance of the previously published HM model. (C)

Abstract = {{Data races make parallel programs hard to understand. Precise race
   detection that stops an execution on first occurrence of a race
   addresses this problem, but it comes with significant overhead. In this
   work, we exploit the insight that precisely detecting only
   write-after-write (WAW) and read-after write (RAW) races suffices to
   provide cleaner semantics for racy programs. We demonstrate that
   stopping an execution only when these races occur ensures that
   synchronization free -regions appear to be executed in isolation and
   that their writes appear atomic. Additionally, the undetected racy
   executions can be given certain deterministic guarantees with efficient
   mechanisms.
   We present CLEAN, a system that precisely detects WAW and RAW races and
   deterministically orders synchronization. We demonstrate that the
   combination of these two relatively inexpensive mechanisms provides
   cleaner semantics for racy programs. We evaluate both software-only and
   hardware-supported CLEAN. The software-only CLEAN runs all Pthread
   benchmarks from the SPLASH-2 and PARSEC suites with an average 7.8x
   slowdown. The overhead of precise WAW and RAW detection (5.8x)
   constitutes the majority of this slowdown. Simple hardware extensions
   reduce the slowdown of CLEAN's race detection to on average 10.4\% and
   never more than 46.7\%.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional fixed dead-time driving strategy can lead to unwanted
   body-diode conduction or momentary cross-conduction. Since the optimum
   dead-time varies with the load current, it is important to continuously
   adjust the dead-time on a cycle by cycle basis. The turning on and off
   of the switching node also require different dead-times. This paper
   introduces a digital continuous dead-time correction circuit that can
   adjust the optimum timing for both the rising and falling edges of the
   output switching waveform for an integrated non-inverting tri-mode DC-DC
   converter. The converter is designed to operate with a Li-ion battery as
   the input power supply (2.7 V to 4.2 V) and to provide an output voltage
   ranging from 1 V to 5 V. An improvement in peak power conversion
   efficiency of 3\% is observed when the output current varies from 0 to
   0.5 A with a switching frequency of 1.5 MHz.}},

Abstract = {{This work proposes a three-port converter structure for high-voltage dc
   (HVDC) applications to facilitate power flow routing between a
   controlled dc bus and two independent dc networks. Control of line power
   flows is achieved via the series injection of incremental dc voltages
   between the networks, thus the converter structure is only rated for a
   fraction of the rated power and voltage of the connecting dc networks.
   Unlike previously proposed dc power flow devices, a significant
   advantage of the presented structure is that the incremental dc voltages
   are generated without requiring power exchange with an external ac
   network. As a result, the proposed converter structure offers a highly
   cost-effective means of routing and controlling dc power flows within
   emerging HVDC grids.}},

   the latest bandwidth demands and new protocols and features. To address
   this need, we propose a new programmable packet processor architecture
   built from an FPGA containing an embedded Network-on-Chip (NoC). The
   architecture is highly flexible, providing more programmability than is
   possible in an ASIC-based design, while supporting throughputs of 400
   and 800 Gb/s. Additionally, we show that our design is 1.7x and 3.2x
   more area efficient, and achieves 1.5x and 3.7x lower latency than the
   best previously proposed FPGA-based packet processor on complex and
   simple applications, respectively. Lastly, we explore various ways a

Abstract = {{Modern FPGA system integration tools, such as Qsys and Vivado, seek to
   help designers easily instantiate and connect IP cores. These tools
   require the cores to ascribe to a specific interconnect abstraction,
   which is either a high-level memory-mapped or low-level point-to-point
   streaming protocol. We present a system-level construction tool that
   gives the designer more control over the nature of the interconnect -
   specifically permitting multicast communication and the ability to
   easily construct custom network topologies. Our tool requires less user
   input than Qsys and yields a 5\% area savings and 35\% reduction in
   simulated execution time for a large and complex linear algebra
   application. The primary goal of this work is to make the designer's job
   easier by automating the design of interconnect, including exploration
   of alternative structures and communication patterns.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, high-level languages and compilers, such as OpenCL have
   improved both productivity and FPGA adoption on a wider scale. One of
   the challenges in the design of high-performance stream FPGA
   applications is iterative manual optimization of the numerous
   application buffers (e.g., arrays, FIFOs and scratch-pads). First, to
   achieve the desired throughput, the programmer faces the burden of
   analyzing the memory accesses of each application buffer, and based on
   observed data locality determines the optimal on-chip buffering, and
   off-chip read/write data access strategy. Second, to minimize throughput
   bottlenecks, the programmer has to carefully partition the limited
   on-chip memory resources among many application buffers. In this work we
   present an FPGA OpenCL library of pre-optimized stream memory components
   (SMCs). The library contains three types of SMCs, which implement
   frequently applied data transformations: 1) stencil, 2) transpose and 3)
   tiling. The library generates SMCs that are optimized both for the
   specific data transformation they perform as well as the user specified
   data set size. Further, to ease the partitioning of on-chip memory
   resources among many application memories, the library automatically
   maps application buffers to on-chip and off-chip memory resources. This
   is achieved by enabling the programmer to specify an on-chip memory
   budget for each component. In terms of on-chip memory, the SMCs perform
   data buffering to exploit data locality and maximize reuse. In terms of
   off-chip memory accesses, the SMCs optimize read/write memory operations
   by performing data coalescing, bursting and prefetching. We show that
   using the SMC library, the programmer can quickly generate scalable,
   pre-optimized stream application memory components, thus reaching

Abstract = {{In the last decade, OpenCL has sparked the interest of the computing
   world as it is a language based on an open standard that can run on many
   different heterogeneous platforms. This standard is continuously
   evolving to adapt to various use cases of different platforms. For
   example, with requests from the FPGA community, the pipe construct was
   added to the standard to facilitate the implementation of streaming
   applications. The versatility of the pipe construct allows several
   different usage modes.
   In this paper, we explore various implementations of pipes to evaluate
   the pipe construct. Our results show that for the FIFO mode, an
   implementation using an off-the-shelf component is favourable due to its
   performance and resource usage. However for the remaining modes, our
   proposed pipe implementation performs significantly better than other
   implementations at a resource utilization cost that is insignificant
   when compared to the abundance of resources in modern FPGAs.}},

Abstract = {{The discrete cosine transform (DCT) and its inverse (IDCT) are widely
   used in image and video compression standards. In this paper, we propose
   a novel unified architecture for DCT and IDCT based on adaptive recoding
   coordinate rotation digital computer (ARC). The proposed architecture
   requires two types of ARC rotators. In addition, an efficient adder and
   shifter-based scale factor approximation is used in the proposed
   architecture. To verify the function and evaluate the performance, the
   proposed architecture is validated on a Virtex 5 FPGA development
   platform. Under DCT-only mode, compared with the proposed architecture,
   a state-of-the-art DCT architecture uses 12\% more hardware resources,
   increases the critical path delay by 7.12\%, consumes 10.1\% more power
   and decreases 4.8 dB in PSNR. Under DCT/IDCT mode, the latest unified
   DCT/IDCT architecture has a factor of 2.17-fold in latency, needs 74.9\%
   more hardware resources and dissipates 52.5\% more power when compared
   to the proposed architecture. In addition, PSNR of the proposed
   architecture is better by 2 dB.}},

Abstract = {{Aquaculture is a major driver of economic growth in rural Southeast Asia
   where many families rely on small-scale fish ponds to supplement their
   livelihoods. However, due to lack of aeration and other advanced
   aquaculture technologies, yields in those rural ponds have been low.
   Aeration systems are typically not employed due to lack of access to
   reliable electricity, as well as prohibitive capital, operating, and
   maintenance costs. In this paper, we describe a design concept for an
   innovative, low-cost, solar-thermal aeration system that is appropriate
   for pond aquaculture in resource-constrained, rural settings. The Solar
   Updraft Aeration (SUpA) system consists of a solar collector and an
   externally-insulated draft tube, which conduct heat to the
   oxygen-depleted deeper layers of the pond. This induces convective
   circulation, which mixes oxygen generated naturally by phytoplankton in
   the epilimnion throughout the pond depth, while preventing oxygen losses
   to the atmosphere due to supersaturation at the pond surface. The result
   is an increase in the overall oxygen content of the pond, which improves
   the health of the fish and allows for greater pond productivity. This
   paper presents the preliminary models developed for concept evaluation.
   These models describe the oxygen generation and consumption within the
   aquaculture pond and evaluate the convective water circulation using
   computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In the next design phase, the
   results from these models will be used to tailor a prototype system for
   field testing in Vietnam.}},

Abstract = {{A base-station (BS) equipped with multiple antennas can use its spatial
   dimensions in three ways: (1) serve multiple users to achieve a
   multiplexing gain, (2) provide diversity to its users, and/or (3) null
   interference at a chosen subset of out-of-cell users. The main
   contribution of this paper is to answer the following question: what is
   the optimal balance between the three competing benefits of
   multiplexing, diversity and interference nulling? We answer this
   question in the context of the downlink of a cellular network in which
   each user chooses its best serving BS, and requests nearby interfering
   BSs for interference nulling. BSs are equipped with a large number of
   antennas, serve multiple single-antenna users using zero-forcing
   beamforming and equal power assignment, and null interference at a
   subset of out-of-cell users. The remaining spatial dimensions provide
   transmit diversity. We assume perfect channel state information at the
   BSs and users. Utilizing tools from stochastic geometry, we show that,
   surprisingly, to maximize the per-BS ergodic sum rate, at the optimal
   allocation of spatial resources, interference nulling does not bring
   tangible benefit. A close-to-optimal strategy is to use none of the
   spatial resources for interference nulling, while reserving 60\% of
   spatial resources for achieving multiplexing and the rest for providing
   diversity.}},

Abstract = {{Climate change has exposed the vulnerability of power utilities to low
   water availability for hydropower generation and to high river
   temperatures for thermoelectric power plants. In this study, we focus on
   a region whose power system is controlled by an operator that relies on
   a set of thermal power plants to generate electricity, and consider the
   conventional economic dispatch problem in the presence of cooling water
   scarcity and climate change constraints. Specifically, we consider water
   constraints on the amount of water that can be consumed by the power
   plants, and heat constraints on the amount of heat that be transferred
   to the environment by the thermoelectric power plants. We focus on a
   practical scenario in which the power plants are aligned on a river
   shared by all the power plants. We then propose a general optimal power
   flow (OPF) framework. The proposed economic dispatch problem is NP-hard.
   We have developed numerical techniques to compute sub-optimal solutions
   to the proposed problem. Finally, we show the impact of climate change
   (i.e., water availability and heat constraints) on electricity

Abstract = {{The diseases in glands of human bodies have been increased with high
   rate in the last decade. Thyroid is one of these glands that its disease
   has spread worldwide. The main function of thyroid gland is to balance
   the metabolism and cells' activity. Since it does its own task
   abnormally, thyroid disorders will occur and the negligence of them may
   cause irreparable events. Because of inaccessibility of Endocrinologist
   experts for most people, modeling and developing an expert system for
   diagnosis thyroid's disease that can be accessible in everywhere is
   vital.
   This paper presents a fuzzy rule-based expert system for diagnosis
   thyroid's disease. This proposed system includes three steps:
   pre-processing (feature selection), neuro-fuzzy classification and
   system evaluating. In the proposed system, the process of diagnosis
   encounters with vagueness and uncertainty in final decision. So, we
   handled the imprecise knowledge by using fuzzy logic. In neuro-fuzzy
   classification step, we generated initial fuzzy rules by k-means
   algorithm and then scaled conjugate gradient algorithm (SCG) was used to
   determine the optimum values of parameters. In the last step, we used
   the generated fuzzy rules to model and evaluate the system. This system
   can help non-experts who are suspicious of their thyroid function or it
   can be used as a diagnosis assistance system to help experts for
   assuring their diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a cellular network where base stations with widely different
   maximum power capabilities (or power classes) are deployed in a highly
   inhomogeneous or irregular pattern-referred to as an irregular cellular
   network. This paper proposes an extension of a spatially correlated
   shadowing model appropriate for irregular networks, that was detailed in
   previous work. The extended model has the capability to generate
   correlated lognormal shadowing in scenarios with inhomogeneous shadowing
   parameters. This is accomplished through computation of multiple
   Gaussian potential fields. A complete algorithm for the shadowing model
   is detailed in the paper. In addition, the model is verified through
   simulation, and computational complexity reduction is discussed. The
   proposed model enables the calculation of correlated shadowing in
   realistic irregular cellular networks. In addition, it forms part of a
   channel simulation framework which will be important in evaluating slow
   adaptation algorithms such as those forming part of 3GPP LTE SON.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies joint resource provisioning and admission control in
   wireless virtualized networks (WVN), where one base station of an
   OFDMA-based wireless network is virtualized into two types of slices
   with resource-based and rate-based reservations. Aiming to maximize the
   total rate of WVN, first, the resource provisioning optimization
   problems are formulated by guaranteeing a minimum requirement for each
   slice. Via constraint relaxation and variable transformations, an
   iterative algorithm is developed for power and sub-carrier allocation.
   Due to the channel variations, WVN suffers from non-zero outage
   probability, i.e., slice requirements cannot always be met. To prevent
   this issue, we present an admission control algorithm in which slice
   requirements are dynamically adjusted based on channel state
   information. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our
   proposed algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for imaging purposes.
   However, the sensitivity and intrinsic contrast of the MRI is low. In
   order to improve the quality of images Gd-DTPA (commercial Magnevist) is
   normally. Because of some limitations of low molecular weight of
   gadolinium chelates, nanoparticles gadolinium based contrast agents are
   proposed. In this study, we synthesized Gd-DTPA and compared its effects
   with Gd2O3-DEG nanoparticles. The samples were prepared at
   concentrations of 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 and 1.2 mM respectively by adding 1.5 ml
   deionized water. The corresponding Gd2O3-DEG nanoparticles diameter was
   measured about 80 nm. An in vitro study was performed using a 1.5 T
   scanner with standard spin echo protocol. Clearly, the signal amplitudes
   in both cases were increased with the Gd concentration at constant
   relaxation time. Also, a linear relation between signal intensity and
   longitudinal relaxation rate (R1) was observed with a correlation
   coefficient close to 1. The values of 4.30 and 14.27 (s(-1). mM(-1))
   were achieved for Gd-DTPA and Gd2O3-DEG nanoparticles special

Abstract = {{High reliance on computed tomography (CT) worldwide results in high
   levels of radiation exposure to patients, which translates into
   increased cancer risks. Efforts to manage radiation dose are
   progressing, but the approach has not been standardized. It was,
   therefore, the aim of this study to systematically assess jurisdictional
   models for their comparative effectiveness. An assessment instrument was
   formulated by identifying 3 domains of related constructs
   (executability, comprehensiveness, rigor) that would negate knowledge
   translation barriers. Six jurisdictions (British Columbia, Ontario,
   Texas, California, Germany, Ireland) that contain institutions with dose
   tracking systems were selected to account for several possible
   approaches to radiation dose management. Two reviewers performed
   independent policy evaluations using the instrument. Statistical
   analyses were performed using Pearson correlation and cohen's kappa.
   Inter-rater reliability was high (kappa = 0.830) for the assessments
   after discussion occurred to clarify the definition and application of
   the domains. There was strong positive correlation for the domains, but
   not themes. The assessment instrument may be useful for relative
   comparisons of knowledge translation potential in regulatory policies.
   The evaluations revealed that precise accreditation standards (such as
   those in British Columbia and California) exhibited the most executable,
   comprehensive and rigorous model for managing radiation dose. California
   achieved the highest individual domain and aggregate scores (51 out of
   72) in our analysis. Our goal is to improve patient safety globally, by
   encouraging translatable jurisdictional models for radiation dose
   management. Further evaluations will need to validate the relationship
   between jurisdictional policies and radiation dose reduction over time.}},

Abstract = {{Upper limb function can be severely impaired after neurological
   injuries. Currently there is no viable method to monitor hand function
   once the patient has returned to the community after rehabilitation.
   Wearable sensors based on egocentric cameras may allow us to capture
   information about a person's independence and reliance on attendant
   care. Such a system needs to be able to differentiate object
   manipulations performed by the user from those performed by a caregiver,
   as well as the user's right and left hands. The angle of the arm in the
   video is important in these classifications. In this study, we compare
   three methods for detecting arm angles in egocentric view. Following
   hand detection, Method I rotates a Haar-like feature around the hand.
   Method II uses Hough line transforms and attempts to determine which of
   the detected lines passing though the hand correspond to the edges of
   the sleeve. Method III detects the contour of the sleeve based on a
   colour histogram obtained through a calibration step, followed by a
   least squares fit to determine the angle of the arm. The three methods
   were tested by comparing their output to manually measured angles in 120
   video frames. Method I was shown to have a mean absolute error of 34.79
   +/- 38.48 degrees, Method II 68.76 +/- 58.01 degrees, and Method III
   23.70 +/- 22.89 degrees. While Method III has the smallest error, it is
   less practical than Method I, which does not require any calibration and
   still has a comparable error. We have demonstrated that a Haar-like
   feature method can be integrated with hand detection to determine arm
   angle in an egocentric computer vision-based wearable sensor for
   detecting hand usage at home.}},

Abstract = {{High reliance on medical technologies in modern medicine has resulted in
   excessive number of alarms. This translates into an increased risk of
   alarm fatigue amongst caregivers, lowered quality of care and
   interrupted patient recovery. Technologies have been developed to
   address alarm safety, but there are inherent limitations to every
   technology. It was, therefore, the aim of this case study to develop an
   evidence-based approach to alarm safety management that can be applied
   across clinical units. Two intensive care units, a Level 3 (Medical
   Surgical Neurological Intensive Care Unit (MSNICU)) and a Level 2, at
   the Toronto Western Hospital were investigated. A recommended alarms
   management program by the ECRI Institute was modified to include only
   steps that were applicable to the investigational units and their
   associated workplace cultures. Observations in the clinical units,
   nursing alarm surveys for MSNICU staff and review of incident reports
   were used to determine the areas of greatest vulnerability and establish
   priorities. Recurring themes in the textual data were indexed and
   refined. Thematic analysis revealed that alarm safety concerns centered
   around three themes of related constructs (alarm noise, alarm
   desensitization and alarm workflow). However, the relative contribution
   of each theme to alarm concerns varied on each unit. Standardized
   procedures and increased educational activities could reduce unnecessary
   noise from frequent alarms. Cultural changes are anticipated to provide
   an effective first step to alarm safety management, however, future
   studies will require analysis of alarm data (number per bed, type and
   duration) to identify high-priority areas per clinical unit in a safe,
   effective manner.}},

Abstract = {{FPGA routing architectures consist of routing wires and programmable
   switches which together account for a significant portion of the fabric
   delay and area. Routing architectures have traditionally been evaluated
   using a full CAD flow with a suite of benchmark circuits. While the
   results of such a flow can be accurate, CAD tools are often tuned to a
   specific architecture type and can take a long time to run which
   prohibits quick exploration of different architectures early in the
   design process. In this paper we present an alternative approach that
   quickly estimates routability for a wide range of architectures without
   the use of benchmark circuits. Our new routability predictor first
   assigns congestion probabilities to the architecture's routing resources
   based on demand estimates found via efficient path enumeration through
   the routing graph. Next, we compute the probabilities of successfully
   routing different source/sink connections and finally we combine them to
   assign an overall routability score. We describe our predictor and
   present routability estimates for a range of 6-LUT and 4-LUT
   architectures, showing reasonable agreement with routability results
   from the full VPR CAD flow in much less CPU time.}},

Abstract = {{The hybrid cloud architecture utilizes both privately owned cloud
   servers and rented instances from public cloud providers, to offer
   flexible services that are particularly suited to enterprise computing.
   The task scheduler at a hybrid cloud decides both the selection of tasks
   to be offloaded to the public cloud and the scheduling of the remaining
   tasks on the processors at the private cloud. In this work, we consider
   the problem of minimizing a weighted sum of the makespan at the private
   cloud and the offloading cost to the public cloud. In contrast to prior
   works, we do not assume that the task processing times are known a
   priori. We show that the original problem can be solved by the same
   algorithms designed toward minimizing the maximum between the makespan
   and the weighted offloading cost, only with doubling of the competitive
   ratio. Furthermore, the latter problem can be equivalently transformed
   into a makespan minimization problem with unrelated processors. In the
   case where all tasks arrive at time zero, we propose a
   Greedy-One-Restart (GOR) algorithm based on online estimation of the
   unknown processing times, and one-time cancellation and rescheduling of
   tasks that turn out to require long processing times. We derive its
   competitive ratio and show that it is upper bounded on the order of the
   square root of the number of private processors, which is a substantial
   improvement over the best known algorithms in the literature. We present
   also a tight constant competitive ratio for the special two-processor
   case. In the case where tasks arrive dynamically with unknown arrival
   times, we extend GOR to Dynamic-GOR (DGOR) and find its competitive
   ratio. Further simulation results demonstrate that GOR and DGOR are
   favorable also in terms of average performance, in comparison with the
   well-known list scheduling algorithm and idealized offline algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Many code constraints can be represented using factor graphs. By
   relaxing these factorable coding constraints to linear constraints, it
   is straightforward to form a decoding optimization problem. Furthermore,
   by pairing these factor graphs with the alternating directions method of
   multipliers (ADMM) technique of large-scale optimization, one can
   develop distributed algorithms to solve the decoding optimization
   problems. However, the non-trivial part has always been developing an
   efficient algorithm for the subroutines of ADMM, which directly relates
   to the geometries of the relaxed coding constraints. In this paper, we
   focus on summarizing existing results and distilling insights to these
   problems. First, we review the ADMM formulation and geometries involved
   in the subroutines. Next, we present a linear time algorithm for
   projecting onto an l(1) ball with box constraints.}},

Abstract = {{LP-decodable multipermutation codes are a class of multipermutation
   codes that can be decoded using linear programming (LP). These codes are
   defined using linearly constrained multipermutation matrices, which are
   binary matrices that satisfy particular row sum and column sum
   constraints. Although generic LP solvers are capable of solving the LP
   decoding problem, they are not efficient in general because they do not
   leverage structures of the problem. This motivates us to study efficient
   decoding algorithms.
   In this paper, we focus on encoding and decoding algorithms for
   LP-decodable multipermutation codes. We first describe an algorithm that
   ``ranks{''} multipermutations. In other words, it maps consecutive
   integers, one by one, to an ordered list of multipermutations. By
   leveraging this algorithm, we develop an encoding algorithm for a code
   proposed by Shieh and Tsai. Regarding decoding algorithms we propose an
   iterative decoding algorithm based on the alternating direction method
   of multipliers (ADMM), each iteration of which can be solved efficiently
   using off-the-shelf techniques. Finally, we study decoding performances
   of different decoders via simulation.}},

Abstract = {{While small cells (SCs) are an important feature of emerging network
   architectures, providing backhaul to SCs is a challenging problem.
   Non-line-of-sight (NLOS) wireless backhaul networks provide a cost
   effective approach in urban areas where providing a wired-or fiber-based
   backhaul is difficult. An important problem in designing such networks
   is to optimize the position of backhaul hubs in a way that all SCs are
   properly serviced. However, this is a NP-complete problem requiring
   suboptimal, but effective, solutions. In this work, we will propose a
   novel suboptimal algorithm, based on dynamic programming, to solve the
   NP-hard problem of hub placement in backhaul networks. We will further
   consider an extended problem of optimizing both the placement of hubs
   and the orientation of the hub antennas. Our design methodology is
   backed up with numerical examples using deterministic channel prediction
   tools which leads to a robust and smart design of the backhaul network.}},

Abstract = {{This paper considers a heterogeneous downlink cloud radio access network
   (C-RAN) where all the base stations (BSs) in the network are connected
   to a central processor (CP) via capacity-limited backhaul links. Under
   this model, we investigate the message-sharing transmission strategy
   where the CP shares each user's message with a fixed subset of BSs,
   which then serve the user through joint beamforming. In this setting,
   although the overall long-term average backhaul consumption is limited
   by the fixed cluster size, the instantaneous backhaul consumption at
   each BS may vary significantly depending on the data rates of the
   scheduled users at each time slot. To avoid such large fluctuations in
   backhaul consumption, this paper proposes a backhaul-aware multicell
   scheduling and beamforming strategy that explicitly accounts for
   backhaul consumption. Specifically, a beamforming design algorithm is
   proposed to maximize the network utility for a downlink C-RAN under both
   per-BS power constraints and per-BS backhaul constraints in each time
   slot. Although this problem has already been considered in our previous
   work, this present paper proposes a new beamforming design algorithm
   that not only has guaranteed convergence but also achieves better system
   performance. This paper also shows that the performance of the proposed
   algorithm can be further improved by iterating with an additional power
   minimization step.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud storage services such as Amazon S3, Drop-Box, Google Drive and
   Microsoft OneDrive have become increasingly popular. However, users may
   be reluctant to completely trust a cloud service. Current proposals in
   the literature to protect the confidentiality, integrity and consistency
   of data stored in the cloud all have shortcomings when used on
   battery-powered devices - they either require devices to be on longer so
   they can communicate directly with each other, rely on a trusted service
   to relay messages, or cannot provide timely detection of attacks.
   We propose Caelus, which addresses these shortcoming. The key insight
   that enables Caelus to do this is having the cloud service declare the
   timing and order of operations on the cloud service. This relieves
   Caelus devices from having to record and send the timing and order of
   operations to each other - instead, they need to only ensure that the
   timing and order of operations both conforms to the cloud's promised
   consistency model and that it is perceived identically on all devices.
   In addition, we show that Caelus is general enough to support popular
   consistency models such as strong, eventual and causal consistency. Our
   experiments show that Caelus can detect consistency violations on
   Amazon's S3 service when the desired consistency requirements set by the
   user are stricter than what S3 provides. Caelus achieves this with a
   roughly 12.6\% increase in CPU utilization on clients, 1.3\% of network
   bandwidth overhead and negligible impact on the battery life of devices.}},

Abstract = {{A 3 DOF micromirror is controlled to steer a laser beam for laser
   scanned display. The micromirror consists of a 1 mm mirror plate which
   is driven by four repulsive-force rotation electrostatic actuators. The
   micromirror is fabricated using the surface micromachining process,
   PolyMUMPs. The overall size of the micromirror including the four
   actuators is 3.5 mm by 3.5 mm. Each actuator can be controlled
   individually by varying the applied voltage. When in operation, changing
   the voltage in one or two actuators will tilt the mirror towards a
   desired direction. Thus, by controlling the voltages applied to the four
   repulsive-force actuators, the micromirror can be rotated to stir the
   laser beam. Three micromirrors are integrated with lasers and optics to
   form a low cost and portable vector graphic display device that is
   integrated as a head-up display system for automotive systems. The laser
   beams are steered at high speeds to produce a static image on a screen.
   The integrated device consists of a TTL modulated laser module, which
   includes a plano-convex lens used to focus the laser beam, and a
   biconcave lens to magnify the output image. The integrated system is
   able to display navigation information and vehicle notifications to the
   driver.}},

Abstract = {{In Ontario, underground stormwater detention chamber systems (USDC) are
   a relatively new alternative to wet detention ponds for the detention
   and treatment of urban stormwater runoff. Few tools are available for
   designers to predict the removal of contaminants from USDC. A conceptual
   model was developed to fill this void and make USDC a more approachable
   solution to stormwater management.
   The Model for Underground Detention Sedimentation (MUDS) predicts the
   removal efficiency of total suspended solids through sedimentation based
   on the hydraulic properties of USDC. As runoff enters the USDC waves of
   particles are released, the pathline of these particles are tracked
   along vertical and longitudinal axes as they move through the USDC to
   determine whether a given diameter of particle is removed by
   sedimentation. Based on the particle size distribution and the density
   of the particles, the mass removal efficiency is determined. The model
   was found to adequately predict the hydraulics and treatment efficiency
   of USDC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a coordinated joint uplink user scheduling and power
   control algorithm across multiple cells in a wireless cellular network.
   The uplink scheduling and power control problem is more challenging than
   the downlink, because the uplink interference pattern strongly depends
   on the schedule decisions of the neighboring cells. This paper considers
   a weighted sum rate maximization objective in the uplink and formulates
   the joint scheduling and power control problem as a non-convex
   mixed-integer problem. The main contribution of the paper is a novel
   problem reformulation based on sum-of-ratios programming and a
   distributed iterative algorithm based on a subsequent quadratic
   transformation. The algorithm optimizes the transmit power and
   scheduling of each iteration jointly in closed form. The proposed
   algorithm has provable convergence guarantee, and is shown to
   significantly outperform existing approaches.}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines whether interference alignment (IA) can be leveraged
   to improve network utility in a multiuser multi-antenna wireless
   cellular network. Optimality of IA from a DoF standpoint has the
   potential to aid conventional network optimization algorithms that
   typically can only find locally optimal solutions. This paper
   investigates the usefulness of IA for interference coordination and
   utility maximization by proposing a two-stage optimization framework for
   a G-cell multi-antenna network with K users/cell, and with full channel
   state information (CSI) available at all base-stations. The first stage
   of the proposed framework focuses exclusively on nulling interference
   from a set of dominant interferers using IA, while the second stage
   optimizes the transmit and receive beamformers iteratively to maximize a
   network-wide utility using the IA solution as the initial point. The
   number of dominant interferers to be nulled in the first stage is guided
   by a set of new feasibility results for partial IA. This paper focuses
   on maximizing the specific network utility of minimum rate over all
   users in the network. Through simulations on two different topologies of
   cluster of BSs either in isolation or in the presence of other
   non-cooperating BSs, the proposed framework with IA initialization is
   observed to outperform straightforward optimization on an isolated
   cluster of BSs. But, IA loses its impact when there is significant
   out-of-cluster interference. Thus, in a large-scale dense cellular
   deployment, the benefit of IA is likely to be limited, even with
   centralized network optimization and full CSI.}},

Abstract = {{Cloud radio access network (C-RAN) is regarded as a promising solution
   of future mobile communication infrastructures. The key character of
   C-RAN is migrating conventional distributed base station functionalities
   into a centralized cloud baseband unit (BBU) pool, which consists of
   many software defined virtual machines (VMs). In this paper, we take the
   joint consideration of VM activation in the BBU pool and joint
   transmission (JT) in the coordinated remote radio heads (RRHs) cluster
   to minimize the system cost of C-RAN, such that the system delay
   constraint can be satisfied. We propose two different approaches to
   solve this problem, i.e., integer search (IS) approach and joint
   optimization (JO) approach. Simulation results suggest that our proposed
   algorithm is more cost-effective than the benchmark algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{Despite the growing deployment of 4G networks, the capacity of cellular
   networks is still insufficient to satisfy the ever-increasing bandwidth
   demand of mobile applications. Given the common interest of mobile
   users, Device-to-Device (D2D) communication has emerged as a promising
   solution to offload cellular traffic and enable proximity-based
   services. One of the main detriments for D2D communication is the lack
   of incentive for mobile users to share their content, since such sharing
   inevitably consumes limited resources and potentially jeopardizes user
   privacy. In this paper, we study the incentive problem in D2D
   communications. Specifically, we model the incentive in offloading
   scenario as an auction game. A trading network is constructed between an
   eNB and users, in which auctions are conducted to group offloading users
   and determine proper rewards. We further design a randomized auction
   mechanism to guarantee system efficiency and truthfulness. Extensive
   experiments verify the effectiveness of our mechanism in that it
   achieves a significant performance gain in comparison with baseline
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-atlas segmentation techniques typically comprise generation of

   stage. Label fusion strategies usually leverage information contained in

   Here, we address this limitation by explicitly incorporating local
   information at the label fusion stage. The proposed method -
   Autocorrecting Walks over Localized Markov Random Fields (AWoL-MRF) - is
   initialized using a set of candidate labels from the atlas library to
   partition a specific structure into high and low confidence regions. The
   labels of the low confidence regions are updated based on a localized
   Markov random field model and a novel sequential inference process
   (walks), which mimics manual segmentation protocols. The approach
   combines a priori information from the atlas library with the local
   spatial constraints improving the accuracy and robustness of the
   existing segmentation methods.}},

Abstract = {{In large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, high cost
   and high power consumption of RF chains typically prohibit the use of
   traditional baseband beamforming which requires one distinct
   radio-frequency (RF) chain per antenna. One possible architecture to
   reduce the number of RF chains is hybrid beamforming in which the
   overall beamformer consists of a concatenation of an analog RF
   beamformer implemented using phase shifters (PSs) and a low-dimensional
   baseband digital beamformer. However, conventional hybrid beamforming
   designs require high-resolution PSs, which are expensive. In this paper,
   we consider transceiver design for maximizing the spectral efficiency of
   a large-scale MIMO system with hybrid beamforming architecture where
   only finite-resolution PSs are available at both ends. We propose a
   heuristic transceiver design for the critical case where the number of
   RF chains is equal to the number of data streams. We show that the
   proposed hybrid beamforming design can achieve a rate close to that of
   optimal exhaustive search. We also suggest how to generalize the
   algorithm for the setting where the number of RF chains exceeds the
   number of data streams. We show that the generalized algorithm can use
   the extra RF chains to significantly improve the system performance in
   the case of low-resolution PSs.}},

Abstract = {{We consider a mobile cloud computing scenario consisting of one user
   with multiple independent tasks, one computing access point (CAP), and
   one remote cloud server. The CAP can either process the received tasks
   from the mobile user or offload them to the cloud, providing additional
   computation capability over traditional mobile cloud computing systems.
   We aim to optimize the offloading decision of the user to minimize the
   overall cost of energy, computation, and delay. It is shown that the
   problem can be formulated as a non-convex quadratically constrained
   quadratic program, which is NP-hard in general. We propose an efficient
   offloading decision algorithm by semidefinite relaxation and a novel
   randomization mapping method. Our simulation results show that the
   proposed algorithm gives nearly optimal performance with only a small
   number of randomization iterations, and adding CAPs to the traditional
   dichotomy of mobile devices and remote cloud servers can drastically
   improve mobile cloud computing performance.}},

Abstract = {{In smart-metered systems, fine-grained time-series power usage data
   (load profile) is communicated from a user to the utility provider. The
   correlation of the load profile with a user's private activities leaves
   open the possibility of inference attacks. Using a rechargeable battery,
   the user can partially obscure its load profile and provide some
   protection to the private information using various strategies for
   charging and discharging the battery (battery management policies).
   Using mutual information as the privacy metric, we study optimal battery
   management policies for discrete alphabets. We show that the problem can
   be formulated as a Markov Decision Process, identify the associated
   state and action space, and using this framework characterize the
   optimal policy for the binary alphabet case.}},

Abstract = {{Cellular and device-to-device (D2D) communication may cause significant
   inter-cell interference (ICI) at a neighboring base station (BS). In
   this work, we aim to maximize the sum rate of a cellular user (CU) and a
   D2D pair, with receive beamforming at the BS equipped with multiple
   antennas, subject to per-node power, maximum ICI, and minimum SINR
   constraints. We propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the sum rate
   in two steps. We first consider the D2D admissibility problem to
   determine whether the D2D pair can share the spectrum with the CU while
   satisfying all the constraints and SINR requirements. We then obtain the
   optimal beam vector and the optimal power levels of the CU and D2D
   transmitters in closed form. The performance of the proposed algorithm
   is studied numerically. It is shown the proposed optimal solution
   substantially outperforms a CU-priority heuristic approach that selects
   the maximum CU power with minimum D2D interference.}},

Abstract = {{This work demonstrates that a set of commercial and scale-out
   applications exhibit significant use of superpages and thus suffer from
   the fixed and small superpage TLB structures of some modern core
   designs. Other processors better cope with superpages at the expense of
   using power-hungry and slow fully-associative TLBs. We consider
   alternate designs that allow all pages to freely share a single,
   power-efficient and fast set-associative TLB. We propose a
   prediction-guided multi-grain TLB design that uses a superpage
   prediction mechanism to avoid multiple lookups in the common case. In
   addition, we evaluate the previously proposed skewed TLB {[}1] which
   builds on principles similar to those used in skewed associative caches
   {[}2]. We enhance the original skewed TLB design by using page size
   prediction to increase its effective associativity. Our prediction-based
   multi-grain TLB design delivers more hits and is more power efficient
   than existing alternatives. The predictor uses a 32-byte prediction
   table indexed by base register values.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed file systems such as Google File System and Hadoop
   Distributed File System have been used to store large volumes of data in
   Cloud data centers. These systems divide data sets in blocks of fixed
   size and replicate them over multiple machines to achieve both
   reliability and efficiency. Recent studies have shown that data blocks
   tend to have a wide disparity in data popularity. In this context, the
   naive block replication schemes used by these systems often cause an
   uneven load distribution across machines, which reduces the overall I/O
   throughput of the system. While many replication algorithms have been
   proposed, existing solutions have not carefully studied the placement of
   data blocks that balances the load across machines, while ensuring node
   and rack-level reliability requirements are satisfied.
   In this paper, we study the dynamic data replication problem with the
   goal of balancing machine load while ensuring machine and rack-level
   reliability requirements are met. We propose several local search
   algorithms that provide constant approximation guarantees, yet simple
   and practical for implementation. We further present Aurora, a dynamic
   block placement mechanism that implements these algorithms in the Hadoop
   Distributed File System with minimal overhead. Through experiments using
   workload traces from Yahoo! and Facebook, we show Aurora reduces machine
   load imbalance by up to 26.9\% compared to existing solutions, while
   satisfying node and rack-level reliability requirements.}},

Abstract = {{Real-time pricing is an incentive-based demand response, which makes it
   challenging to predict the outcome of the implementation. This paper
   focuses on the prediction of consumer behaviour from real-time pricing
   based on a population game model. The participation in demand response
   and the rescheduling of consumption are studied to predict change in
   demand. Moreover, we looked at different types of consumers and used
   their characteristics to study dynamics among them. The dynamic
   behaviour of the consumers from pricing is modeled with the replicator
   dynamic equation. Simulation results show how consumers schedule their
   consumption during peak and non-peak hours. Based on this model, the
   demand response from real-time pricing is predicted over time, and the
   effect in peak reduction is studied. An evolutionary game approach
   enables the interpretation of dynamic consumer behaviour and the design
   of adaptable pricing for consumers.}},

Abstract = {{We measure and visualize the ability-to-see, from the human eye, as that
   ability-to-see propagates through space. ``Biological veillance flux{''}
   is a metric of sensory precision emitted from the eyes and falling on
   objects, with much greater detail than merely tracking the center of the
   eye's field of view.
   This work makes it possible to ``see sight{''} and ``measure sight{''}
   as the ``sight{''} travels through three-dimensional space. In earlier
   work we measured veillance flux from electronic sensors and cameras.
   Now, we examine biological veillance flux. The result is a method to
   detect radiation of information-bearing optical sensitivity, as opposed
   to radiation of ordinary light energy in the opposite direction.
   These measurements can be used as an augmented-reality visualization of
   human sight. They can serve as an interactive score tracking how much a
   target is seen. Additionally, they could serve as a data-rich metric of
   visual precision directed by human eyes toward control panels in
   industrial applications, or as a metric of visual precision directed by
   human eyes towards printed material or digital media, for advertising,
   arts or entertainment applications. Extramissive optics, as a new field
   of research, is thus expanded into the biological realm.}},

Abstract = {{A novel class of modulation is introduced, for frequency transformation
   and spectral synthesis in real-time. Swarm modulation has potential
   applications to enhance human hearing with extended frequency ranges, in
   medical diagnostics for electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram
   (EEG) and other medical signals, for RADAR analysis, for user-interface
   sonification, and for sound synthesis or non-synthetic sound
   transformation.
   Swarm modulation is a new way to transform signals, and is demonstrated
   for transforming subsonic and ultrasonic sound into the audible range of
   human hearing. Swarm modulation is based on the principle of
   phase-incoherent frequency-roaming oscillation. Features in the
   frequency-time plane are reconstructed via a time-varying process,
   controllable with instantaneous zero-latency reaction time to new
   information.
   Swarm modulation allows prioritization of salient output spectral
   features for efficient processing, and overcomes cyclic beating patterns
   when Fourier and wavelet-based methods are applied in a stationary
   manner. Swarm modulation can flexibly re-map sound when a user
   expressively touches physical matter creating vibration. By detecting
   subsonic, sonic and ultrasonic vibrations, we can add to materials a
   rich acoustic user-feedback that can be adjusted to sound like a bell,
   xylophone, dull piece of wood, or a variety of other objects, in
   real-time. By dynamically controlling the output sound spectrum
   depending on the input spectrum, simultaneously with a continuous and
   low-latency temporal response, the system imitates the physicality of
   touching a real object.
   Applied in control panels and expressive control surfaces, swarm
   modulation can create realistic sonic feedback, for human head-up
   operation of controls in critical applications.}},

Abstract = {{We propose a highly expressive input device having keys that each
   generate an acoustic sound or similar disturbance when struck, rubbed,
   or hit in various ways. A separate acoustic pickup is used for each key,
   and these pickups are connected to a computer having an array of analog
   inputs. Non-binary, continuous sensitivity allows a smooth
   ({''}fluid{''}) range of control. We describe three embodiments of the
   input device, one that works in each of the 3 states-of-matter: solid,
   liquid, and gas. These use (respectively) geophones, hydrophones, and
   microphones as the pickup devices.
   When used with liquid or gas, the device becomes a fluid-dynamic
   user-interface, comprising an array of fluid flows that are sensitive to
   touch. Sounds are produced by a Karman vortex street generated across a
   separate shedder bar, shedder orifice, or other sound producing device
   for each finger hole. Data is entered by covering the holes in various
   ways. This gives highly intricate variations in each keystroke by using
   a concept we call ``finger embouchure{''}, akin to the embouchure
   expression imparted to a flute by the shape of a player's mouth.
   We also present the concept of an array of frequency shifters, which we
   refer to as a shifterbank. The shifterbank helps in providing meaningful
   audible feedback for the data input, as well as helping in one very
   specialized form of data entry, namely musical composition.}},

Abstract = {{In order to realize the rapid deployment of indoor localization systems,
   the crowdsourcing method has been proposed to reduce the collection
   workload. However, compared to conventional methods, the reduced number
   of received signal strength (RSS) values lends greater influence to
   noises and erroneous measurements in RSS values. In this paper, a
   graph-based semi-supervised learning (G-SSL) method is used to exploit
   the correlation of RSS values at nearby locations to infer an optimal
   RSS value at each location in terms of error. The RSS difference between
   different locations is used as a part of cost function to improve the
   performance of G-SSL. Experimental results show that the proposed method
   results in a smoother radio map and improved localization accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{The penetration of renewable energy has been increasing rapidly through
   out the world. But its generation is intermittent unlike conventional
   sources. Energy storages provide an environmentally sustainable
   mechanism to reduce its variability. And given the geographically
   distributed nature of renewable energy sources, using a network of
   energy storages instead of using centralized ones can be helpful in
   avoiding congestion in transmission networks. In this paper we study a
   power system with such a network of storages. We provide a stochastic
   formulation to obtain the optimal scheduling policy for it. We show that
   the problem of calculating that policy is not convex in general and we
   find sufficient conditions for convexity. We also propose and
   numerically evaluate a heuristic algorithm which provides sub-optimal
   policies when the problem is non-convex.}},

   consider a power grid that is supplied by one conventional generator

   aggregator operates the power grid and aims at minimizing the long-term

   solution, taking into account the uncertainty of the renewable
   generation, loads, and energy prices. We demonstrate that our proposed
   algorithm is asymptotically optimal as the storage capacity increases
   and the CG ramping constraint loosens. The distributed implementation
   enjoys a fast convergence rate and enables each RG and the aggregator to
   make their own decisions.}},

Abstract = {{Affective states classification has become an important part of the
   Human-Computer Interface (HCI) study. In recent years, studies of
   physiological signals, such as ECG, GSR and EEG on affective expression
   have shown very promising results. In this study, we carried out two
   experiments to better understand the neurological expression of emotions
   through the use of EEG signals. In particular, we carried out a
   subject-independent affective states classification study using
   narrow-band spectral power of the EEG signals. The MAHNOB-HCI-Tagging
   database was used for experimental purposes, which was collected over 27
   participants with film clips as emotional stimuli. An averaged correct
   classification rate of 64.74\% and 62.75\% were achieved respectively on
   the 3-class Arousal and valence states classification problem using
   support vector machine (SVM) with ANOVA as feature selection mechanism.
   The second experiment, a proof-of-concept study, was to examine the
   suitability of the current in-market consumer-grade EEG headsets, with
   emphasis on the location of the electrodes, for the above affective
   states classification application.}},

Abstract = {{For the emerging heterogeneous networks, the theoretical analysis has
   been largely limited to using a Poisson point process (PPP) model for
   the locations of base stations (BSs). This model has been shown to
   provide a lower bound on the coverage probability (CP) when compared
   with real-world deployments; as such, in this paper, we focus on a
   perturbed hexagonal lattice model. We show that, as compared to a PPP,
   this model better fits the locations of BSs in real-world cellular
   networks. We provide a tractable analysis for the signal-to-interference
   (SIR) CP at any point of an interference-limited reuse-1 network.
   Simulation results help illustrate the accuracy of the theory developed.
   The resulting average SIR CP (averaged over the network area) lies in
   between that of the PPP and the perfect hexagonal lattice models. The
   perturbation allows us to quantify the loss in the CP in moving from a
   perfect lattice model to a random BS deployment. Finally, we compare the
   perturbed lattice to real-world BS deployments using data from publicly
   available databases. Using the method of minimum contrast we show that
   the average SIR CP from the presented formulation accurately fits that
   of real-world cellular networks.}},

   in SO-TDMA is similar to carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) in the
   beginning, but quickly converges to TDMA with an adaptive pseudo-frame
   structure. This approach has the benefits of TDMA in a high-load traffic
   environment, while overcoming its disadvantages in low-load,
   heterogeneous traffic scenarios. Furthermore, it supports distributed
   and asynchronous channel-access operation as in CSMA. These are achieved
   by dynamically adapting the transmission opportunity duration based on
   the common idle/busy channel state information acquired by each node
   through learning, without explicit message passing. Performance
   comparison of CSMA, TDMA, and SO-TDMA in terms of effective capacity,

Abstract = {{This paper reports a micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based
   XY-stage integrating compliant motion amplification mechanisms for
   nanopositioning at sub nanometer resolution. The MEMS stage is driven by
   bidirectional Z-beam electrothermal actuators that generate large output
   forces to activate the amplification mechanisms. The amplification
   mechanisms are used in their inverse (motion reduction) mode to convert
   micrometer input displacements (from the Z-beam actuators) into
   nanometer output displacements at a constant motion reduction ratio with
   good linearity. This unique design significantly enhances the
   positioning resolution of the XY-stage. An analytical model is developed
   to predict output displacements of the XY-stage as a function of the
   input voltages applied to the Z-beam actuators, and the predicted
   results agree with the experimental results. Capacitive position sensors
   are arranged along both X-and Y-axes for measuring the input
   displacements of the amplification mechanisms, enabling closed-loop
   nanopositioning control of the XY-stage. The device calibration results
   show that, within an actuation voltage of +/- 15 V, the MEMS stage
   offers a motion range of +/- 1 mu m and a displacement resolution better
   than 0.3 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Dielectrophoresis is an electric effect enabling the contact-free
   manipulation of cells and other small particles. The forces applied to
   particles experiencing dielectrophoresis are highly dependent on the
   gradient of the electric field experienced by said particles. In
   constrained design problems in which voltages are upper-bounded,
   modifying the shape of the electrodes that generate the electric field
   is the primary option available to increase the applied force. This
   paper provides readers with a fast, easy-to-implement technique to
   optimize dielectrophoresis electrodes for any planar electrode design
   problem. The procedure to numerically simulate electrodes using COMSOL
   Multiphysics is described, and the approach is demonstrated through the
   optimization of a custom electrode design problem.}},

Abstract = {{Secure operating regions are utilized by system operators to define
   system limits and rapidly assess the state of the power grid. Dynamic
   Security Assessment produces a set of power system limit points that are
   then used to construct the secure operating region. This data set is
   typically large for a complex power system, and processing these in a
   timely manner becomes difficult. In this paper, we propose novel
   techniques to efficiently automate the computation of the secure
   operating region. The algorithm reduces the size of the limit point data
   set and simplifies the operating region constraints while retaining
   maximal secure operation region. Our algorithm can be used in off-line
   studies for compressing a large limit point data set with minimal
   information loss. It can also be applied to on-line studies in which
   processing efficiency is critical. Our algorithm was applied to identify
   voltage and transient secure operating regions on a IEEE 39 bus system.}},

Abstract = {{Power demands are rising continuously and accommodating these in a
   sustainable and economical manner without any loss of service is a
   daunting challenge. We propose a novel demand response ( DR) scheme
   which taps onto the inherent consumer flexibility to curtail peak
   aggregate power demands in order to minimize dependence on expensive
   high carbon-footprint peak generators. Our strategy capitalizes on the
   ubiquitous communication capability present in the smart grid to foster
   cooperation amongst a large number of consumers with a heterogeneous mix
   of loads and comfort requirements. Simplistic communication signals are
   broadcast periodically by the grid operator which are used by consumers
   to make local decisions on power reduction. Comprehensive analyses using
   simulations and theoretical tools such as water-filling in convex
   optimization show that this distributed DR strategy is highly scalable
   and enables the system to rapidly converge to optimality.}},

Abstract = {{Communication latency poses a challenge to the operation of control
   systems in power systems. Specifically, excessive delay between sensors
   and controllers can substantially worsen the performance of distributed
   control schemes. In this paper we utilize the parametric feedback
   linearization (PFL) control to actuate energy storage systems in order
   to achieve transient stability. A delay-adaptive design capitalizing on
   the features of PFL control is presented in this work in order to
   enhance the time delay tolerance of the power system. Specifically, a
   piece-wise linear delay-adaptive property of the PFL control is
   investigated. The parameters of the PFL controller are adapted according
   to the latency value in the cyber component of the grid in order to
   optimize performance. The enhancements achieved by the proposed
   delay-adaptive scheme on the performance of the distributed controller
   are shown when applied to the New England 39-bus and WECC 9-bus power
   systems following the occurrence of a physical disturbance. Further,
   numerical results show that the proposed delay-adaptive control is able

Abstract = {{A new class of switching attacks in smart grid systems is investigated
   in this work. The proposed attack relies on calculated switchings of a
   fast-acting energy storage system (ESS) in order to drive the system
   state variable of the target generator beyond the stability boundary.
   Based on understanding the structure of the power system, an adversary
   uses the swing equation to find the stability boundary of the target
   generator. In order to conduct a successful switching attack, the
   adversary intercepts the power system's measurements and switches the
   circuit breaker of the ESS back-and-forth depending on the value of
   system state variable. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the
   proposed switching attack when applied to the New England power system.}},

Abstract = {{A parametric controller is proposed for the frequency and phase
   stabilization after the occurrence of a disturbance in the power grid.
   The proposed controller is based on the feedback linearization control
   theory. To drive the frequency of the system generators to stability,
   the controller relies on receiving timely phasor measurement unit (PMU)
   readings about the power grid to employ fast-acting flywheels that are
   situated near the synchronous generators in order to balance a swing
   equation model of the synchronous generators. The advantages of the
   proposed controller are that it is tunable and integrates well with
   existing governor controls in contrast to other forms of PMU-based
   control. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed
   controller when applied to the New England power system. Further, a
   comparison is drawn between the controller and recently-proposed
   nonlinear controllers for transient stability.}},

Abstract = {{Monitoring and actuation represent critical tasks for electric power
   utilities to maintain system stability and reliability. As such, the
   utility is highly dependent on a low latency communication
   infrastructure for receiving and transmitting measurement and control
   data to make accurate decisions. This dependency, however, can be
   exploited by an adversary to disrupt the integrity of the grid. We
   demonstrate that Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, even if perpetrated on
   a subset of cyber communication nodes, has the potential to succeed in
   disrupting the overall grid. One countermeasure to DoS attacks is
   enabling cyber elements to distributively reconfigure the system's
   routing topology so that malicious nodes are isolated. We propose a
   collaborative reputation-based topology configuration scheme and through
   game theoretic principles we prove that a low-latency Nash Equilibrium
   routing topology always exists for the system. Numerical results
   indicate that during an attack on a subset of cyber nodes, the proposed
   algorithm effectively enables the remaining nodes to converge quickly to
   an equilibrium topology and maintain dynamical stability in the specific
   instance of an islanded microgrid system.}},

Abstract = {{Today's power grid is provisioned conservatively for rarely occurring
   demand peaks. These peaks are served by flexible generation systems that
   are typically costly and have significant carbon footprint. Distributed
   power sources such as wind turbines and solar panels are sustainable but
   unreliable as these have inherently variable generation capacities. An
   effective power dispatch management system is necessary to harness the
   significant generation potential of these intermittent systems. In this
   work, a novel scheme is proposed which leverages upon the recent
   cyber-enablement in the power grid to distributively dispatch a large
   number of strategically interacting small-scale variable generators. We
   incorporate evolutionary game theoretic techniques into the formulation
   of the dispatch strategy as it provides an opportunity to model the
   aggregate behaviour of tactical agents making inter-dependent decisions
   and aids with establishing deterministic steady state predictions of the
   system state. Numerical and theoretical results presented in this work
   show that the proposed strategy is highly scalable and enables real-time
   power dispatch of intermittent systems while maintaining low
   computational overhead.}},
