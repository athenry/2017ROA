Abstract = {{This paper investigates the impact of the dynamic hydraulic conditions
   on the kinetics of chlorine decay in water supply systems. A simulation
   framework has been developed for the scale-adaptive hydraulic and
   chlorine decay modelling under steady- and unsteady-state flows. An
   unsteady decay coefficient is defined which depends upon the absolute
   value of shear stress and the rate of change of shear stress for
   quasi-unsteady and unsteady-state flows. By coupling novel
   instrumentation technologies for continuous hydraulic monitoring and
   water quality sensors for in-pipe water quality sensing a pioneering
   experimental and analytical investigation was carried out in a water
   transmission main. The results were used to model monochloramine decay
   and these demonstrate that the dynamic hydraulic conditions have a
   significant impact on water quality deterioration. The spatial and
   temporal resolution of experimental data provides new insights for the
   near real-time modelling and management of water quality as well as
   highlighting the uncertainty and challenges of accurately modelling the
   loss of disinfectant in water supply networks.}},

Abstract = {{The composition of cell-surface proteins changes during lineage
   specification, altering cellular responses to their milieu. The changes
   that characterize maturation of early neural stem cells (NSCs) remain
   poorly understood. Here we use mass spectrometry-based cell surface
   capture technology to profile the cell surface of early NSCs and
   demonstrate functional requirements for several enriched molecules.
   Primitive NSCs arise from embryonic stem cells upon removal of
   Transforming growth factor- signaling, while definitive NSCs arise from
   primitive NSCs upon Lif removal and FGF addition. In vivo aggregation
   assays revealed that N-cadherin upregulation is sufficient for the
   initial exclusion of definitive NSCs from pluripotent ectoderm, while
   c-kit signaling limits progeny of primitive NSCs. Furthermore, we
   implicate EphA4 in primitive NSC survival signaling and Erbb2 as being
   required for NSC proliferation. This work elucidates several key
   mediators of NSC function whose relevance is confirmed on
   forebrain-derived populations and identifies a host of other candidates
   that may regulate NSCs. Stem Cells2014;32:258-268}},

Abstract = {{Advances in preclinical radiotherapy systems have provided the technical
   foundations for delivering highly heterogeneous dose distributions for
   unique radiobiological experiments, but methods to deliver arbitrary
   dose distributions are in their infancy. This study developed a method
   to optimize and automatically deliver planar dose distributions on a
   recently developed preclinical radiotherapy platform. The method was
   based on empirically determined dose kernel distributions from
   radiochromic film measurements. These kernels were used to determine
   optimal animal stage positions and beam weights to deliver a desired
   dose distribution at a given depth using a sequential quadratic
   programming optimization algorithm. The method was validated by
   end-to-end delivery of two dosimetric challenges designed to quantify
   targeting and dosimetric accuracy. The results revelead an overall
   targeting accuracy of 112 mu m and a dosimetric delivery error,
   calculated along four line profiles in radiochromic film measurements,
   of 6.8\%. Mean absolute delivery error across a linear dose gradient
   between 0 and 1 Gy over 7.5 mm was 0.03 Gy. These results confirm the
   optimization framework is an effective platform for delivery of
   millimetre scale heterogeneous dose distributions with sub-millimetre
   accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Biomarkers such as proteins and nucleic acids released from human cells,
   bacteria, and viruses offer a wealth of information pertinent to
   diagnosis and treatment ranging from cancer to infectious disease. The
   release of these molecules from within cells is a crucial step in

   can be achieved, inline, within a microfluidic channel; that it can
   produce highly efficient lysis and biomarker release; and, further, that
   it can do so with minimal degradation of the released biomarkers.
   Central to this new technology is the use of three-dimensional
   sharp-tipped electrodes (3DSTEs) in lysis, which we prove using
   experiment and finite-element modeling produce the electric field
   concentration necessary for efficient cell wall rupture.}},

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The problem of finite-time vibration-attenuation controller design for
   buildings structural systems with parameter uncertainties is the concern
   of this paper. The objective of designing controllers is to guarantee
   the finite-time stability of closed-loop systems with a prescribed level
   of disturbance attenuation. First, based on matrix transformation, the
   structural system is described as state-space model, which contains
   parameter uncertainties. Then, based on finite-time stability analysis
   method, some sufficient conditions for the existence of finite-time
   vibration-attenuation controllers are obtained. By solving these
   conditions, the desired controllers can be obtained for the closed-loop
   system to be finite-time stable with the performance parallel to z
   parallel to(2) < gamma parallel to omega parallel to(2). It is shown by
   the simulation results, that compared with some Lyapunov asymptotic
   stability results, finite-time stability control can obtain better state
   responses, especially while the system is under nonzero initial states.}},

Title = {{Effect of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage on Word Generation}},
Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{Background. Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH) survivors commonly
   exhibit impairment on phonemic and semantic fluency tests; however, it
   is unclear which of the contributing cognitive processes are compromised
   in aSAH patients. One method of disentangling these processes is to
   compare initial word production, which is a rapid, semiautomatic,
   frontal-executive process, and late phase word production, which is
   dependent on more effortful retrieval and lexical size and requires a
   more distributed neural network. Methods. Seventy-two individuals with
   aSAH and twenty-five control subjects were tested on a cognitive battery
   including the phonemic and semantic fluency task. Demographic and
   clinical information was also collected. Results. Compared to control
   subjects, patients with aSAH were treated by clipping and those with
   multiple aneurysms were impaired across the duration of the phonemic
   test. Among patients treated by coiling, those with anterior
   communicating artery aneurysms or a neurological complication
   (intraventricular hemorrhage, vasospasm, and edema) showed worse output
   only in the last 45 seconds of the phonemic test. Patients performed
   comparably to control subjects on the semantic test. Conclusions. These
   results support a ``diffuse damage{''} hypothesis of aSAH, indicated by
   late phase phonemic fluency impairment. Overall, the phonemic and
   semantic tests represent a viable, rapid clinical screening tool in the
   postoperative assessment of patients with aSAH.}},

Abstract = {{Epithelium is abundantly present in the human body as it lines most
   major organs. Therefore, ensuring the proper function of epithelium is
   pivotal for successfully engineering whole organ replacements. An
   important characteristic of mature epithelium is apical-basal
   polarization which can be obtained using the air-liquid interface (ALI)
   culture system. Micropatterning is a widely used bioengineering strategy
   to spatially control the location and organization of cells on tissue
   culture substrates. Micropatterning is therefore an interesting method
   for generating patterned epithelium. Enabling micropatterning of
   epithelial cells however requires micropatterning methods that are
   designed to (i) be compatible with permeable membranes substrates and
   (ii) allow prolonged culture of patterned cells, both of which are
   required for appropriate epithelial apical basal polarization. Here, we
   describe a number of methods we have developed for generating
   monoculture as well as coculture of epithelial cells that are compatible
   with ALI culture.}},

Journal = {{SHOCK AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2014}},
Abstract = {{The exact natural frequencies, mode shapes, and the corresponding
   orthogonality relations are important in forced vibration analysis via
   modal expansion. In the present paper, a free vibration analysis is
   conducted to determine the exact natural frequencies and mode shapes of
   an axially loaded beam carrying several absorbers. An explicit
   expression is presented for the generalized orthogonality relations.
   These generalized orthogonality conditions are employed along with the
   assumed modes method to perform forced vibration analysis. The present
   approach is compared to other approximate methods in the literature with
   the classical orthogonality relations and different choice of mode
   shapes. The results indicate that the use of the generalized
   orthogonality relation with the exact mode shapes is required for a

Pages = {{1142-1150}},
Abstract = {{Sperm selection is essential to assisted reproductive technology (ART),
   influencing treatment outcomes and the health of offspring. The
   fundamental challenge of sperm selection is dictated by biology: a
   heterogeneous population of similar to 10(8) sperm per milliliter with a
   short lifetime in vitro. However, conventional sperm selection
   approaches result in less than 50\% improvement in DNA integrity. Here,
   a clinically applicable microfluidic device is presented that selects
   sperm based on the progressive motility in 500 parallel microchannels.
   The result is a one-step procedure for semen purification and high DNA
   integrity sperm selection from 1 mL of raw semen in under 20 minutes.
   Experiments with bull sperm indicate more than 89\% improvement in
   selected sperm vitality. Clinical tests with human sperm show more than
   80\% improvement in human DNA integrity, significantly outperforming the
   best current practices. These results demonstrate the presence of a
   sub-population of sperm with nearly intact chromatin and DNA integrity,
   and a simple clinically-applicable lab-on-a-chip method to select this
   population.}},

Abstract = {{Background and ObjectiveMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common
   condition for which available pharmaceutical treatments are not always
   effective and can have side-effects. Therefore, alternative and/or
   complementary MDD treatments are needed. Research on facial expressions
   has shown that facial movements can induce the corresponding emotions,
   particularly when specific attention is paid to voluntarily activating
   muscles that are typically only activated involuntarily while expressing
   emotions. We hypothesized that functional electrical stimulation (FES)
   applied to facial muscles may enhance this effect due to its ability to
   modulate central nervous system plasticity. Thus, applying FES to the
   facial muscles associated with smiling (including the Duchenne marker)
   may increase the activity of subcortical nuclei related to positive
   emotions and counteract symptoms of depression.
   MethodsTwelve able-bodied subjects received FES and were compared with a
   group of 12 control subjects. Both groups underwent the same
   experimental procedures involving a cognitive task, and a deception was
   used such that subjects were unaware that the objective was to modulate
   mood. Assessments with the Positive and Negative Affect ScheduleExpanded
   Form (PANAS-X) were administered before and after the experiment.
   ResultsNo significant between-group differences were found in the change
   scores for our primary outcomes, the PANAS-X item happy, and aggregate
   scores Joviality and Positive Affect. Significant differences were,
   however, detected for secondary outcomes determined, daring, scared, and
   concentrating.
   ConclusionsThese results suggest that modulating emotion using FES may
   be possible, but is difficult to target accurately. Further work is
   warranted to explore FES applications to MDD.}},

Title = {{Continuum-discontinuum analysis of failure mechanisms around unsupported
   circular excavations in anisotropic clay shales}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ROCK MECHANICS AND MINING SCIENCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{65}},
Pages = {{96-115}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The stability of circular excavations in clay shales is a key issue in
   the drilling and funnelling industries as well as in the held of deep
   geological waste storage. A large body of experimental evidence
   indicates that the damaged zone around these cavities is influenced by
   strong mechanical anisotropy induced by the layered material structure.
   The vast majority of numerical models adopted to date to analyse the
   stability of openings in layered rocks have been based on continuum
   mechanics principles using classic shear failure theory for
   elasto-plastic materials. However, a number of experimental observations
   demonstrate that clay shales may tail in a brittle manner under
   low-confinement conditions such as those characterizing the near-field
   of the excavation. Therefore, an alternative numerical approach based on
   non-linear fracture mechanics principles and the discrete element method
   is adopted to gain new insight into the failure process of this class of
   geomaterials. In order to account for the influence of clay shale
   microstructure on its mechanical behaviour a newly developed approach to
   capture the anisotropy of strength is proposed. With this numerical
   approach, the cohesive strength parameters of the fracture model are
   assumed to be a function of the relative orientation between the element
   bonds and the layering orientation. The effectiveness of the numerical
   technique is quantitatively demonstrated by simulating standard rock
   mechanics tests on an indurated claystone, namely Opalinus Clay.
   Emergent strength and deformation properties, together with the
   simulated fracture mechanisms, are shown to be in good agreement with
   experimental observations. The modelling technique is then applied to
   the simulation of the Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) around a circular
   tunnel in horizontally bedded Opalinus Clay. The simulated fracturing
   process is mainly discussed in the context of the damage mechanisms
   observed at the Mont Terri URL. Furthermore, the influence of in situ
   stress on resulting EDZ geometry is analysed together with possible
   implications for ground support and tunnel constructability. Modelling
   results highlight the importance of shear strength mobilization along
   bedding planes in controlling the EDZ formation process. In particular,
   slippage of bedding planes is shown to cause rock mass deconfinement
   which in turn promotes brittle failure processes in the form of
   spalling. The numerical technique is currently limited to
   two-dimensional analyses without any thermo-hydro-mechanical coupling.

Abstract = {{Environmental attributes are critical risk factors that have proven to
   affect collision rates. Associated driving risks can be reduced by
   better maintenance of roadway infrastructure, enforcement of speed
   limits or other traffic laws. Given the preventive nature of these
   policies and regulations, accurate predictions of environmental
   attributes are needed. Currently, most of road safety prediction models
   are based on deterministic weather forecasts which are not able to
   capture changes in the likelihood of collision occurrence. As a result,
   probabilistic forecast is required to improve decision making, mainly in
   winter. In this paper, a stochastic approach to modeling highway
   collisions in winter time is considered which enables better assessment
   of driving conditions and a more accurate prediction. A logistic
   regression model with covariates is applied to crash data where
   environmental characteristics are modeled as a finite state space
   homogeneous multivariate discrete time Markov chain. After fitting the
   model, weather prediction as well as the conditional predictive
   probability distribution of collision occurrence are obtained. As the
   application, the ability of the proposed model to predict hourly
   environmental attributes and collision occurrence is examined using real
   highway crash data. The performance of the developed stochastic model is
   compared with several existing models in the literature using actual
   collision data. The results demonstrate that the proposed stochastic
   model outperforms existing models and it accurately predicts collision
   occurrence in the presence of stochastically changeable winter weather
   conditions. As a result, the proposed probabilistic forecast model can
   be used as a valuable tool in a decision support system. (C) 2013

Journal = {{NUCLEAR ENGINEERING AND DESIGN}},

Volume = {{266}},
Pages = {{148-154}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Three dimensional numerical simulations are conducted on a full scale
   CANDU Moderator and transient variations of the temperature and velocity
   distributions inside the tank are determined. The results show that the
   flow and temperature distributions inside the moderator tank are three
   dimensional and no symmetry plane can be identified.
   Competition between the upward moving buoyancy driven flows and the
   downward moving momentum driven flows in the center region of the tank,
   results in the formation of circulation zones. The moderator tank
   operates in the buoyancy driven mode and any small disturbances in the
   flow or temperature makes the system unstable and asymmetric.
   Different types of temperature fluctuations are noted inside the tank:
   (i) large amplitude are at the boundaries between the hot and cold; (ii)
   low amplitude are in the core of the tank; (iii) high frequency
   fluctuations are in the regions with high velocities and (iv) low
   frequency fluctuations are in the regions with lower velocities. (C)

Abstract = {{Tissue engineering enables the generation of three-dimensional (3D)
   functional cardiac tissue for preclinical testing in vitro, which is
   critical for new drug development. However, current tissue engineering
   methods poorly recapitulate the architecture of oriented cardiac bundles
   with supporting capillaries. In this study, we designed a
   microfabricated bioreactor to generate 3D micro-tissues, termed
   biowires, using both primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and human
   embryonic stem cell (hESC) derived cardiomyocytes. Perfusable cardiac
   biowires were generated with polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tubing
   template, and were integrated with electrical field stimulation using
   carbon rod electrodes. To demonstrate the feasibility of this platform
   for pharmaceutical testing, nitric oxide (NO) was released from perfused
   sodium nitroprusside (SNP) solution and diffused through the tubing. The
   NO treatment slowed down the spontaneous beating of cardiac biowires
   based on hESC derived cardiomyocytes and degraded the myofibrillar
   cytoskeleton of the cardiomyocytes within the biowires. The biowires
   were also integrated with electrical stimulation using carbon rod
   electrodes to further improve phenotype of cardiomyocytes, as indicated
   by organized contractile apparatus, higher Young's modulus, and improved
   electrical properties. This microfabricated platform provides a unique
   opportunity to assess pharmacological effects on cardiac tissue in vitro
   by perfusion in a cardiac bundle model, which could provide improved
   physiological relevance.}},

Abstract = {{We study a multi-antenna broadcast channel with two legitimate receivers

   eavesdropper is unknown to the legitimate terminals but satisfies a
   maximum rank constraint. As our main result we characterize the

   common and private messages. We show that a direct extension of the
   single-user wiretap codebook does not achieve the secrecy degrees of
   freedom. Our proposed optimal scheme involves decomposing the signal
   space into a common subspace, which can be observed by both receivers,
   and private subspaces which can be observed by only one of the
   receivers, and carefully transmitting a subset of messages in each
   subspace. We also consider the case when each user's private message
   must additionally remain confidential from the other legitimate receiver
   and characterize the s.d.o.f. region in this case.}},

Abstract = {{Surface segregation of Pt is investigated in nanoporous metals formed by
   dealloying of Ag-Au-Pt alloys. By exposing freshly-dealloyed
   nanostructures to surprisingly low temperatures in the presence of
   laboratory air, the Pt segregates to the surface of the ligaments thanks
   to its preferential interaction with oxygen; in contrast, in an inert
   atmosphere (Ar-H-2), Pt mostly remains in the bulk of the ligaments.
   Moreover, the co-segregation of Pt and 0 hinders the thermal coarsening
   of the ligaments. The averaged size of the ligaments, the resulting
   roughness factor (R-f) and the fraction of Pt atoms on the surface of
   the ligaments were investigated. Scanning electron microscopy,
   transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and
   low energy ion scattering were used to characterize the resulting

   information that needs to be measured and applied to restrict the
   co-deposition of impurities. In this study this potential was measured
   using cyclic voltammetry. As the activity of SiO2 in the electrolyte
   affects the deposition potential, the measurements were carried out in a
   range of SiO2 concentrations, allowing the prediction of potential
   change during the actual deposition process, where the SiO2 content
   undergoes fluctuations. The kinetics of the oxidation and reduction
   reactions were also studied using the recorded voltammograms, showing
   that reduction of Si is a two steps process controlled by diffusion. (C)

Abstract = {{Radon (Rn-222) and progenies emanate from soil and building components
   and can create an indoor air quality hazard. In this study, nine
   concrete constituents, including the supplementary cementitious
   materials (SCMs) fly ash and metakaolin, were used to create eleven
   different concrete mixtures. We investigated the effect of constituent
   radium specific activity, radon effective activity and emanation
   fraction on the concrete emanation fraction and the radon exhalation
   rate. Given the serious health effects associated with radionuclide
   exposure, experimental results were coupled with Monte Carlo simulations
   to demonstrate predictive differences in the indoor radon concentration
   due to concrete mixture design. The results from this study show that,
   on average, fly ash constituents possessed radium specific activities
   ranging from 100 Bq/kg to 200 Bq/kg and emanation fractions ranging from
   1.1\% to 2.5\%. The lowest emitting concrete mixture containing fly ash
   resulted in a 3.4\% reduction in the concrete emanation fraction, owing
   to the relatively low emanation that exists when fly ash is part of
   concrete. On average, the metakaolin constituents contained radium
   specific activities ranging from 67 Bq/kg to 600 Bq/kg and emanation
   fractions ranging from 8.4\% to 15.5\%, and changed the total concrete
   emanation fraction by roughly +/- 5\% relative to control samples. The
   results from this study suggest that SCMs can reduce indoor radon
   exposure from concrete, contingent upon SCM radionucleotide content and
   emanation fraction. Lastly, the experimental results provide
   SCM-specific concrete emanation fractions for indoor radon exposure
   modeling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   predicts the crack spacings and widths of R/SFRC with reasonable
   accuracy and outperforms other steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC)
   crack spacing models currently available. The model is expanded to
   include biaxial stress conditions to facilitate the analysis of elements

Abstract = {{Building professionals are increasingly being called upon to conduct
   indoor microbial investigations as they remediate moisture-damaged
   buildings and design new, healthy, sustainable buildings. Characterizing
   the indoor microbial community present in the built environment is
   challenging and complicated by the vast array of biological methods
   available to building professionals. Furthermore, the particular
   biological technique employed to study an indoor environment can have a
   significant impact on the results obtained. This study evaluates the
   advantages and disadvantages of four biological methods suitable for
   indoor microbial investigations: culturing, quantitative polymerase
   chain reaction (qPCR), Sanger sequencing, and pyrosequencing. The
   results obtained from a study of four buildings are used to evaluate the
   merits of each bioanalytical approach. In each of the four study sites,
   the microbial-laden dust recovered on HVAC filters was used to provide a
   passive, long-term sample of the indoor air. Culturing of the
   microorganisms recovered from the dust was the least expensive method
   tested but provided a limited characterization of the microbial
   community present. qPCR provided the most specific information about the
   presence and quantity of target microorganisms but this method requires
   a priori knowledge of the species of interest and specifically designed
   primers that may not enumerate unanticipated species. Sanger sequencing
   provided microbial identification at the species level but lacked
   coverage to fully describe the microbial community present.
   Pyrosequencing provided in-depth sequence coverage of the microbial
   community present (to the genus level) but the vast dataset generated
   required increased computational analysis and data storage.
   Nevertheless, pyrosequencing when coupled with qPCR for target species
   quantification represents a viable approach that should become more
   accessible to building professionals as user-friendly software for
   analyzing sequencing results becomes available and more commercial
   laboratories offer these services.}},

Abstract = {{Trunk instability during sitting is a major problem following
   neuromuscular injuries such as stroke and spinal cord injury. In order
   to develop new strategies for alleviating this problem, a better
   understanding of the intrinsic contributions of the healthy trunk to
   sitting control is needed. As such, this study set out to propose and
   validate a novel methodology for determining multidirectional trunk
   stiffness during sitting using randomized transient perturbations.
   Fifteen healthy individuals sitting naturally on a custommade seat were
   randomly perturbed in eight horizontal directions. Trunk stiffness and
   damping were quantified using force and trunk kinematics in combination
   with translational and torsional models of a mass-spring-damper system.
   The results indicate that stiffness and damping of the healthy trunk are
   roughly symmetrical between the two body sides. Moreover, both
   quantities are smallest in the anterior and largest in the lateral
   directions. In conclusion, a novel protocol for identifying intrinsic
   trunk stiffness and damping has been developed, eliminating anticipation
   effects with respect to perturbation timing and direction. Subsequent
   studies will use these findings as a reference not only for quantifying
   trunk stiffness and damping in individuals with various neuromuscular
   disorders, but also for assessing whether neuroprostheses could increase
   upper body stiffness and, hence, stability. (C) 2013 IPEM. Published by

Abstract = {{This work studies games with coupled constraints in general topology
   optical wavelength-division multiplexed (WDM) networks towards
   optimizing channel optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR). We first
   develop a model to describe the network and an OSNR model for each link
   by investigating the interaction between the network and physical
   layers. The nonlinear threshold is considered as the link capacity
   constraint and we study the case in which channel powers are adjustable
   at optical switching nodes (e.g., optical cross-connects (OXCs)). An
   OSNR Nash game is formulated with coupled utilities and constraints, in
   which each player (channel) maximizes its own utility function related
   to minimizing its individual OSNR degradation. We exploit this OSNR Nash
   game in three types of network topologies: multi-link topology,
   quasi-ring topology and general topology. A hierarchical decomposition
   approach leads to a lower-level game for channels with no coupled
   constraints and a higher-level optimization problem for the network.
   Computation of equilibria based on this hierarchical algorithm is
   discussed and evaluated by simulation for each of the three network
   topologies. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Dental implant failures that occur clinically for unknown reasons could
   be related to undiagnosed hyperglycemia. The exact mechanisms that
   underlie such failures are not known, but there is a general consensus
   that bone growth is compromised in hyperglycemia. Nevertheless,
   contradictory findings exist related to pen-implant bone healing in
   hyperglycemia. We hypothesized that hyperglycemia delays early bone
   healing by impeding osteoconduction, and that the compromised implant
   integration due to hyperglycemia could be abrogated by using
   nanotopographically complex implants. Thus we undertook two parallel
   experiments, an osteotomy model and a bone in-growth chamber model. The
   osteotomy model tracked temporal bone healing in the femora of
   euglycemic and hyperglycemic rats using micro computed tomography
   (microCT) analysis and histology. The bone in-growth chamber model used
   implant surfaces of either micro- or nanotopographical complexity and
   measured bone-implant contact (BIC) using backscattered electron imaging
   in both metabolic groups. Quantitative microCT analyses on bone volume,
   trabeculae number and trabeculae connectivity density provided clear
   evidence that bone healing, both reparative trabecular bone formation
   and remodeling, was delayed in hyperglycemia, and the reparative bone
   volume changed with time between metabolic groups. Furthermore,
   fluorochrome labeling showed evidently less mineralized bone in
   hyperglycemic than euglycemic animals. An increased probability of
   osteoconduction was seen on nano-compared with microtopographically
   complex surfaces, independent of metabolic group. The
   nanotopographically complex surfaces in hyperglycemia outperformed
   microtopographically complex surfaces in euglycemic animals. In
   conclusion, the compromised implant integration in hyperglycemia is
   abrogated by the addition of nanotopographical features to an underlying
   microtopographically complex implant surface. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia

Abstract = {{We present multiple methods of high aspect ratio hole drilling in fused
   silica glass, taking advantage of high power and high repetition rate
   picosecond lasers and flexible beam delivery methods to excise deep
   holes with minimal collateral damage. Combinations of static and
   synchronous scanning of laser focus were explored over a range of laser
   repetition rates and burst-train profiles that dramatically vary laser
   plume interaction dynamics, heat-affected zone, and heat accumulation
   physics. Chemically assisted etching of picosecond laser modification
   tracks are also presented as an extension from femtosecond laser writing
   of volume nanograting to form high aspect ratio (77) channels.
   Processing windows are identified for the various beam delivery methods
   that optimize the laser exposure over energy, wavelength, and repetition
   rate to reduce microcracking and deleterious heating effects. The
   results show the benefits of femtosecond laser interactions in glass
   extend into the picosecond domain, where the attributes of higher power
   further yield wide processing windows and significantly faster
   fabrication speed. High aspect ratio holes of 400 mu m depth were formed
   over widely varying rates of 333 holes per second for mildly cracked
   holes in static-focal positioning through to one hole per second for
   low-damage and taper free holes in synchronous scanning.}},

Abstract = {{RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful therapeutic strategy that induces
   gene silencing by targeting disease-causing mRNA and can lead to their
   removal through degradation pathways. The potential of RNAi is
   especially relevant in cancer therapy, as it can be designed to regulate
   the expression of genes involved in all stages of tumor development
   (initiation, growth, and metastasis). We have generated gene silencing
   3D DNA prisms that integrate antisense oligonucleotide therapeutics at
   1, 2, 4, and 6 positions. Synthesis of these structures is readily
   achieved and leads to the assembly of highly monodisperse and
   well-characterized structures. We have shown that antisense strands
   scaffolded on DNA cages can readily induce gene silencing in mammalian
   cells and maintain gene knockdown levels more effectively than single
   and double stranded controls through increased stability of bound
   antisense units.}},

Abstract = {{Tension stiffening is still a matter of discussion into the scientific
   community; the study of this phenomenon is even more relevant in
   structural members where the total reinforcement consists of a proper
   combination of traditional rebars and steel fibers. In fact, fiber
   reinforced concrete is now a worldwide-used material characterized by an
   enhanced behavior at ultimate limit states as well as at serviceability
   limit states, thanks to its ability in providing a better crack control.
   This paper aims at investigating tension stiffening by discussing
   pure-tension tests on reinforced concrete prisms having different sizes,
   reinforcement ratios, amount of steel fibers and concrete strength. The
   latter two parameters are deeply studied in order to determine the
   influence of fibers on crack patterns as well as the significant effect
   of the concrete strength; both parameters determine narrower cracks
   characterized by a smaller crack width. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Laue diffraction measurements made using polychromatic synchrotron
   x-radiation have revealed significant changes to the microscopic strain
   distributions in an Alloy 600 (UNS N06600) tube following the
   application of a circumferential (hoop) stress and then as a result of
   stress corrosion cracking (SCC). The changes in the elastic and plastic
   strain distributions were studied for the same area near the outer
   diameter of the tube prepared as a C-ring. Following the application of
   the circumferential stress, there was a notable loss of crystal order
   within the outermost 3 mu m to 5 mu m of the tube surface as a result of
   plastic processes; further into the sample the elastic strains in grain
   boundaries become oriented toward the direction of the impressed stress.
   The average intensity of oriented tensile strain is 5x10(-3) within the
   outermost 50 mu m of the C-ring. After corrosion, the elastic strain
   distribution in the same region becomes slightly compressive. The
   strains associated with a network of fine incipient cracks on the
   outside diameter of the C-ring were explored; elastic compressive
   strains were found within few micrometers from the crack center
   presumably as a result of crack opening, while plastic deformation was
   limited to the immediate crack region.}},

Abstract = {{Turbulent heat transfer in circular pipe flow with constant heat flux on

   frictional Reynolds number Re (tau) = 180 and for Prandtl numbers in the
   range 0.1 a parts per thousand currency sign Pr a parts per thousand

   difference scheme, combined with a projection method for the pressure,
   on a collocated grid in cylindrical coordinates. The predicted
   statistical properties of the velocity and temperature fields show good
   agreement with available data from direct numerical simulations.
   Further, we study the local thermal flow structures for different
   Prandtl numbers. As expected, our simulations predict that by reducing
   the Prandtl number, the range of variations in the local heat transfer
   and the Nusselt number decrease. Moreover, the thermal flow structures
   smear in the flow and become larger in size with less sharpness,
   especially in the vicinity of the wall. In order to characterize the
   local instantaneous heat transfer, probability density functions (PDFs)
   for the instantaneous Nusselt number are derived for different Prandtl
   number. Also, it is shown that these PDFs are actually scaled by the
   square root of the Prandtl number, so that a single PDF can be employed
   for all Prandtl numbers. The curve fits of the PDFs are presented in two
   forms of log-normal and skewed Gaussian distributions.}},

Abstract = {{Epilepsy is a dynamical disease and its effects are evident in over
   fifty million people worldwide. This study focused on objective
   classification of the multiple states involved in the brain's
   epileptiform activity. Four datasets from three different rodent
   hippocampal preparations were explored, wherein seizure-like-events
   (SLE) were induced by the perfusion of a low - Mg2+/high - K+ solution
   or 4-Aminopyridine. Local field potentials were recorded from CA3
   pyramidal neurons and interneurons and modeled as Markov processes.
   Specifically, hidden Markov models (HMM) were used to determine the
   nature of the states present. Properties of the Hilbert transform were
   used to construct the feature spaces for HMM training. By sequentially
   applying the HMM training algorithm, multiple states were identified
   both in episodes of SLE and nonSLE activity. Specifically, preSLE and
   postSLE states were differentiated and multiple inner SLE states were
   identified. This was accomplished using features extracted from the
   lower frequencies (1-4 Hz, 4-8 Hz) alongside those of both the low-
   (40-100 Hz) and high-gamma (100-200 Hz) of the recorded electrical
   activity. The learning paradigm of this HMM-based system eliminates the
   inherent bias associated with other learning algorithms that depend on
   predetermined state segmentation and renders it an appropriate candidate
   for SLE classification.}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes a method for constructing a three-dimensional model
   of the hard palate using electro-magnetic articulography, and defines
   two algorithms to derive constriction degree and constriction location
   values from the trajectories of tongue coils using this model. The
   kinematics of tongue motion that have been transformed into constriction
   degree and constriction location values are investigated in detail to
   determine whether this type of representation obeys the constraints
   theorized to operate over higher level motor control. Results show that
   palate-relative coordinate spaces decouple mechanical dependencies
   present in the tongue, while maintaining low-level kinematic properties.
   They additionally preserve the 1/3 power law for speed and curvature
   observed across many motor systems. Finally, it is shown that tongue
   movements in a palate relative coordinate space more closely correspond
   to their optimal, jerk-minimized trajectories. These results suggest
   that this type of coordinate space provides a closer match to higher
   level motor-planning, in line with production models that specify
   control units in terms of vocal tract constriction parameters. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{We present a scalable, out-of-plane desalination approach using ion

   enables multiplexing in three dimensions, providing the functional

   125-200 mu m, and applied voltage of 5 V, the energy requirement is 4.6
   Wh L-1 for 20 mM solution, and 13.8 Wh L-1 for 200 mM. Energy efficiency
   is found to be insensitive to flow rate as the depletion boundary
   adjusts to yield a commensurate volume of purified water. Scaled-up
   devices are presented, which have a 3-fold improvement in functional
   density over planar systems.}},

Abstract = {{The Opalinus Clay (OPA) is an argillaceous rock formation selected to
   host a deep geologic repository for high-level nuclear waste in
   Switzerland. It has been shown that the excavation damaged zone (EDZ) in
   this formation is heavily affected by the anisotropic mechanical
   response of the material related to the presence of bedding planes. In
   this context, the purpose of this study is twofold: (i) to illustrate
   the new developments that have been introduced into the combined
   finite-discrete element method (FEM/DEM) to model layered materials and
   (ii) to demonstrate the effectiveness of this new modelling approach in
   simulating the short-term mechanical response of OPA at the
   laboratory-scale. A transversely isotropic elastic constitutive law is
   implemented to account for the anisotropic elastic modulus, while a
   procedure to incorporate a distribution of preferentially oriented
   defects is devised to capture the anisotropic strength. Laboratory
   results of indirect tensile tests and uniaxial compression tests are
   used to calibrate the numerical model. Emergent strength and deformation
   properties, together with the simulated damage mechanisms, are shown to
   be in strong agreement with experimental observations. Subsequently, the
   calibrated model is validated by investigating the effect of confinement
   and the influence of the loading angle with respect to the specimen
   anisotropy. Simulated fracture patterns are discussed in the context of
   the theory of brittle rock failure and analyzed with reference to the
   EDZ formation mechanisms observed at the Mont Terri Underground Research
   Laboratory.}},

Abstract = {{Patients undergoing a bone marrow stem cell transplant (BMT) face
   various risk factors. Analyzing data from past transplants could enhance
   the understanding of the factors influencing success. Records up to 120
   measurements per transplant procedure from 1751 patients undergoing BMT
   were collected (Shariati Hospital). Collaborative filtering techniques
   allowed the processing of highly sparse records with 22.3\% missing
   values. Ten-fold cross-validation was used to evaluate the performance
   of various classification algorithms trained on predicting the survival
   status. Modest accuracy levels were obtained in predicting the survival
   status (AUC = 0.69). More importantly, however, operations that had the
   highest chances of success were shown to be identifiable with high
   accuracy, e. g., 92\% or 97\% when identifying 74 or 31 recipients,
   respectively. Identifying the patients with the highest chances of
   survival has direct application in the prioritization of resources and
   in donor matching. For patients where high-confidence prediction is not
   achieved, assigning a probability to their survival odds has potential
   applications in probabilistic decision support systems and in
   combination with other sources of information.}},

Abstract = {{Recent achievements in wireless technologies have opened up enormous
   opportunities for the implementation of ubiquitous health care systems
   in providing rich contextual information and warning mechanisms against
   abnormal conditions. This helps with the automatic and remote
   monitoring/tracking of patients in hospitals and facilitates and with
   the supervision of fragile, elderly people in their own domestic
   environment through automatic systems to handle the remote drug
   delivery. This paper presents a new modeling and analysis framework for
   the multipatient positioning in a wireless body area network (WBAN)
   which exploits the spatial sparsity of patients and a sparse fast
   Fourier transform (FFT)-based feature extraction mechanism for
   monitoring of patients and for reporting the movement tracking to a
   central database server containing patient vital information. The main
   goal of this paper is to achieve a high degree of accuracy and
   resolution in the patient localization with less computational
   complexity in the implementation using the compressive sensing theory.
   We represent the patients' positions as a sparse vector obtained by the
   discrete segmentation of the patient movement space in a circular grid.
   To estimate this vector, a compressive-sampling-based two-level FFT
   (CS-2FFT) feature vector is synthesized for each received signal from
   the biosensors embedded on the patient's body at each grid point. This
   feature extraction process benefits in the combination of both
   short-time and longtime properties of the received signals. The
   robustness of the proposed CS-2FFT-based algorithm in terms of the
   average positioning error is numerically evaluated using the realistic
   parameters in the IEEE 802.15.6-WBAN standard in the presence of
   additive white Gaussian noise. Due to the circular grid pattern and the
   CS-2FFT feature extraction method, the proposed scheme represents a
   significant reduction in the computational complexity, while improving
   the level of the resolution and the localization accuracy when compared
   to some classical CS-based positioning algorithms.}},

Abstract = {{This paper compares the static properties of a total of seven
   cold-formed rectangular hollow sections (RHS) manufactured by different
   methods: (1) direct-forming, (2) continuous-forming, and (3)
   continuous-forming plus stress-relieving by heat treatment. The static
   properties compared are: (1) tensile stress-strain behaviour and
   ductility around the cross-section, (2) compressive stress-strain
   behaviour of the entire cross-section, and (3) longitudinal residual
   stress around the cross-section. The maximum values of longitudinal
   compressive residual stresses estimated from the stub column test
   results are used to check the accuracy of the longitudinal residual
   stress measurements from strips. Finally, the measured longitudinal
   residual stress gradients are incorporated into column models to study
   the column behaviour of RHS with different production histories. It is
   found that, in general, the static properties of a direct-formed RHS are
   midway between those of its continuous-formed and

Abstract = {{A comprehensive context management approach is necessary in the era of
   ubiquitous technologies, and efficient context data collection is one of
   the most fundamental and important processes for realizing comprehensive
   context management. Traditional context data collection approaches are
   based on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) or User Datagram Protocol
   (UDP) over Internet Protocol (IP), which has several disadvantages, such
   as lack of efficient mobility support, security and data transfer
   efficiency. Content-Centric Networking (CCN), on the other hand,
   provides advantages in terms of mobility, security and bandwidth
   efficiency in comparison with IP. In this paper, we introduce our
   user-centric comprehensive context management framework, and propose a
   secure and efficient context data collection and provision approach
   based on the framework using CCN as a network and transport layer. This
   context collection approach provides a flexible security mechanism by
   introducing three levels of security type. It also provides bandwidth
   efficiency by taking advantage of CCN's content caching; performance
   evaluation results show that our approach can reduce bandwidth
   consumption up to 99\% for pull and up to 46\% for push in comparison to
   a UDP/IP-based system. Our approach also provides advantages in
   supporting mobility and leveraging multiple interfaces. Copyright (c)

Title = {{Model-based PSF and MTF estimation and validation from skeletal clinical
   CT images}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{41}},
Number = {{1}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: A method was developed to correct for systematic errors in
   estimating the thickness of thin bones due to image blurring in CT
   images using bone interfaces to estimate the point-spread-function
   (PSF). This study validates the accuracy of the PSFs estimated using
   said method from various clinical CT images featuring cortical bones.
   Methods: Gaussian PSFs, characterized by a different extent in the z
   (scan) direction than in the x and y directions were obtained using our
   method from 11 clinical CT scans of a cadaveric craniofacial skeleton.
   These PSFs were estimated for multiple combinations of scanning
   parameters and reconstruction methods. The actual PSF for each scan
   setting was measured using the slanted-slit technique within the image
   slice plane and the longitudinal axis. The Gaussian PSF and the
   corresponding modulation transfer function (MTF) are compared against
   the actual PSF and MTF for validation.
   Results: The differences (errors) between the actual and estimated
   full-width half-max (FWHM) of the PSFs were 0.09 +/- 0.05 and 0.14 +/-
   0.11 mm for the xy and z axes, respectively. The overall errors in the
   predicted frequencies measured at 75\%, 50\%, 25\%, 10\%, and 5\% MTF
   levels were 0.06 +/- 0.07 and 0.06 +/- 0.04 cycles/mm for the xy and z
   axes, respectively. The accuracy of the estimates was dependent on
   whether they were reconstructed with a standard kernel (Toshiba's FC68,
   mean error of 0.06 +/- 0.05 mm, MTF mean error 0.02 +/- 0.02 cycles/mm)
   or a high resolution bone kernel (Toshiba's FC81, PSF FWHM error 0.12
   +/- 0.03 mm, MTF mean error 0.09 +/- 0.08 cycles/mm).
   Conclusions: The method is accurate in 3D for an image reconstructed
   using a standard reconstruction kernel, which conforms to the Gaussian
   PSF assumption but less accurate when using a high resolution bone
   kernel. The method is a practical and self-contained means of estimating
   the PSF in clinical CT images featuring cortical bones, without the need
   phantoms or any prior knowledge about the scanner-specific parameters.

Abstract = {{In this cross-sectional study, we found that areal bone mineral density
   (aBMD) at the knee and specific tibia bone geometry variables are
   associated with fragility fractures in men and women with chronic spinal
   cord injury (SCI).
   Low aBMD of the hip and knee regions have been associated with fractures
   among individuals with chronic motor complete SCI; however, it is
   unclear whether these variables can be used to identify those at risk of
   fracture. In this cross-sectional study, we examined whether BMD and
   geometry measures are associated with lower extremity fragility
   fractures in individuals with chronic SCI.
   Adults with chronic {[}duration of injury a parts per thousand yenaEuro
   parts per thousand 2 years] traumatic SCI (C1-L1 American Spinal Cord
   Injury Association Impairment Scale A-D) reported post injury lower
   extremity fragility fractures. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)
   was used to measure aBMD of the hip, distal femur, and proximal tibia
   regions, while bone geometry at the tibia was assessed using peripheral
   quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). Logistic regression and
   univariate analyses were used to identify whether clinical
   characteristics or bone geometry variables were associated with
   fractures.
   Seventy individuals with SCI {[}mean age (standard deviation {[}SD]),
   48.8 (11.5); 20 females] reported 19 fragility fractures. Individuals
   without fractures had significantly greater aBMD of the hip and knee
   regions and indices of bone geometry. Every SD decrease in aBMD of the
   distal femur and proximal tibia, trabecular volumetric bone mineral
   density, and polar moment of inertia was associated with fracture
   prevalence after adjusting for motor complete injury (odds ratio ranged
   from 3.2 to 6.1).
   Low knee aBMD and suboptimal bone geometry are significantly associated
   with fractures. Prospective studies are necessary to confirm the bone
   parameters reported to predict fracture risk in individuals with low
   bone mass and chronic SCI.}},

Abstract = {{Virtual reality has been extensively studied for applications in

   commercial products can also be considered for inclusion in a patient's
   rehabilitation program. In this study, the Sony EyeToy (A (R)) and
   PlayStation 2 (A (R)) were used with the AntiGrav (TM) game to evaluate
   the user's head movement actions. The game required lateral head, body,
   and arm movements. Over the course of 9 sessions of game play, average
   and maximum head excursions remained constant. However, the frequency of
   head movement increased over the sessions. The results suggest that the
   video game could be used for postural balance rehabilitation through
   head movements, and their effect on the vestibular system. Future work
   will evaluate how such vestibular exercise, and an increase in head
   movement frequency over training sessions can support postural balance
   improvements.}},

Abstract = {{Objective. To survey the recent literature from the late 1980s to recent
   years in order to assess the relationship between resin degradation,
   catalyzed by biological factors, and clinical failure outcomes such as
   marginal breakdown.
   Methods. The literature shows that degradation occurs in many
   manufacturers' products despite varied vinyl acrylate compositions. The
   authors examine salivary enzyme activity and their ability to degrade
   the polymeric matrix of resin composites and adhesives, as well as oral
   microorganisms that can promote demineralization of the tooth surface at
   the marginal interface. A survey of recent research relating matrix
   metalloproteinase (MMPs) to the degradation of the exposed collagen at
   the dentin adhesive interface is also discussed in the context of
   marginal breakdown.
   Results. The literature provides strong support that together, the above
   factors can breakdown the marginal interface and limit the longevity of
   resin composite restorations. The authors have found that the field's
   current understanding of resin biodegradation in the oral cavity is just
   beginning to grasp the role of bacteria and enzymes in the failure of
   resin-based restorations.
   Significance. Knowledge of these biodegradation processes is pertinent
   to areas where innovative strategies in the chemistry of restorative
   materials are anticipated to enhance the longevity of resin composites.

Abstract = {{Thread-level speculation (TLS) was researched to automatically
   parallelize portions of serial programs for execution, and transactional
   memory (TM) was studied as a promising alternative of lock for parallel
   programming due to its simplicity. Both TLS and TM require similar
   underlying support. In the paper, we present SeTM (sequential
   transactional memory), a hardware enhanced TM system which supports TLS
   at minor extra cost. Signature is an effective way to buffer speculative
   states in TM and TLS. But it cripples TM and TLS performance due to its
   false-positive in terms of conflict detection, especially for
   conflict-intensive TLS. SeTM adopts R/W bits and signature concurrently
   to ameliorate this bad influence. Additionally, SeTM introduces the fast
   rollback mechanism, which provides fast abort recovery for eager
   log-based HTM and TLS. The most important contribution of SeTM is the
   conflict-tolerant mechanism, which tolerates some ambiguous data
   conflicts in TLS. Finally, in order to achieve an efficient execution
   for these un-order transactions, we add an extra ordering mechanism for
   SeTM. With this ordering mechanism, the transactions in TM can also gain
   the performance improvement with the support of conflict-tolerant
   mechanism. Our evaluation major on TM and TLS separately. For the TLS
   applications, six representative benchmarks have been adopted to
   evaluate the above model. Our experimental results show that our scheme
   improves the execution performance of most tested codes at a modest
   hardware cost. For a set of important scientific loops, we report the
   highest speedup of 6.5 with 15 cores. Besides, experimental results also
   show good scalability of SeTM system. For the TM applications, with
   respect to LogTM-SE, the benchmarks from STAMP also gain performance
   improvement signally. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Register-transfer level (RTL) debug has become a resource-intensive
   bottleneck in modern very large scale integration computer-aided design
   flows, consuming as much as 32\% of the total verification effort. This
   paper aims to advance the state-of-the-art in automated RTL debuggers,
   which return all potential bugs in the RTL, called solutions, along with
   corresponding corrections. First, an iterative algorithm is presented to
   compute the dominance relationships between RTL blocks. These
   relationships are leveraged to discover implied solutions with every new
   solution, thus significantly reducing the number of formal engine calls.
   Furthermore, a modern Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solver is tailored to
   detect debugging nonsolutions, sets of RTL blocks guaranteed to be
   bug-free, and to imply other nonsolutions using the precomputed RTL
   dominance relationships. Extensive experiments on industrial designs
   show a three-fold reduction in the number of SAT calls due to solution
   implications, coupled with faster SAT run-times due to nonsolution
   implications, resulting in a 2.63x overall speedup in total SAT solving
   time, demonstrating the robustness and practicality of the proposed
   approach.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a ``distributed high-voltage dc (HVDC) converter{''}
   for offshore wind farms. The proposed converter topology allows series
   interconnection of wind turbines with the need of neither ac transformer
   nor offshore platform at the sending end. Each wind turbine is equipped
   with a 5-MW permanent-magnet synchronous generator and an ac-dc-dc
   converter. The converter topology is a diode rectifier (ac-dc) cascaded
   with a single-switch step-down converter (dc-dc). The dc-dc stage allows
   the current to flow at all times in the dc link while simultaneously
   regulating generator torque. The inverter station, located onshore, is a
   thyristor-based converter that performs dc link current regulation. It
   also regulates the HVDC link voltage through supervisory inverter
   controls. A complete wind farm is simulated using the PSCAD/EMTDC
   software package. The 150-MW wind farm is modelled using six units of 25
   MW with a rated dc link voltage of 125 kV at 1.2 kA. The simulation
   demonstrates the stable operation of the proposed configuration where
   each turbine is able to independently perform peak power tracking.}},

Abstract = {{In this absorption spectroscopy study of CO2 and CO in the near-infrared
   (NIR) region between 6317 and 6335 cm(-1), we focus on the broadening
   effect of H-2 at room temperature (296 K) Absorption spectra were
   collected using a Tunable Diode Laser (TDL) operating in the NIR for
   various gas mixtures filled in a monel gas cell. The experimental
   parameters chosen in this study are highly relevant to
   combustion-related industrial applications where TDL sensors are
   employed to monitor CO2 and CO emissions. In many such applications H-2
   is always present and there is a need to understand the broadening
   effect of H-2 on CO2 and CO to improve the detection quality of such
   sensors. Voigt profile analysis was performed to retrieve the
   experimental parameters. CO2-H-2 broadening coefficients are presented
   for room temperature. From our study on the CO-H-2 broadening effect at
   room temperature, we conclude that within the sensitivity of the
   measurements made, the presence of H-2 has no significant effect in this
   region. The parameters calculated in this study are intended to be an
   addition to spectroscopic databases such as HITRAN. (C) 2013 Published

Abstract = {{The low-temperature oxygen-fuel (LTOF) spray is a modification of high
   velocity oxygen fuel spray. In this process, the high-temperature gas is
   accelerated to supersonic speed through a Laval nozzle followed by a
   straight barrel. By injecting room temperature gas into the mixing
   chamber, the temperature of the gas can be controlled in a range of
   about 1000-2500 K, so that some oxygen and temperature-sensitive
   materials, such as titanium and copper, can avoid oxidation or
   decomposition during the spraying process. The purpose of this paper is
   to establish a 2-D mathematical model to simulate the supersonic gas
   dynamics and particles behavior in LTOF process. The temperature and
   velocity of the flow fields, and the trajectory and heating of in-flight
   particles are predicted for different operating parameters. The model is
   validated by experimental data in the literature. Effects of the mixing
   gas flow rates, particle sizes, and injection conditions on this process
   were investigated as well.}},

Pages = {{547-554}},
Abstract = {{Digital microfluidics (DMF) has emerged as a popular format for
   implementing quantitative immunoassays for diagnostic biomarkers. All
   previous reports of such assays have relied on optical detection; here,
   we introduce the first digital microfluidic immunoassay relying on
   electrochemical detection. In this system, an indium tin oxide (ITO)
   based DMF top plate was modified to include gold sensing electrodes and
   silver counter/pseudoreference electrodes suitable for in-line
   amperometric measurements. A thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
   immunoassay procedure was developed relying on magnetic microparticles
   conjugated with primary antibody (Ab1). Antigen molecules are captured
   followed by capture of a secondary antibody (Ab2) conjugated with
   horseradish peroxidase enzyme (HRP). HRP catalyzes the oxidation of
   3,3', 5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) which can be detected
   amperometrically. The limit of detection of the technique (2.4 mu IU
   mL(-1)) is compatible with clinical applications; moreover, the
   simplicity and the small size of the detector suggest utility in the
   future for portable analysis.}},

Pages = {{577-583}},
Abstract = {{Stored red blood cells (RBCs) show progressive deformability changes
   during blood banking/ storage. Their deformability changes over an 8
   weeks' storage period were measured using a microfluidic device.
   Hydrodynamic focusing controls the orientation and position of
   individual RBCs within the microchannel. High-speed imaging (5000 frames
   s(-1)) captures the dynamic deformation behavior of the cells, and
   together with automated image analysis, enables the characterization of
   over 1000 RBCs within 3 minutes. Multiple parameters including
   deformation index (DI), time constant (shape recovery rate), and RBC
   circularity were quantified. Compared to previous studies on stored RBC
   deformability, our results include a significantly higher number of
   cells (>1000 cells per sample vs. a few to tens of cells per sample)
   and, for the first time, reveal deformation changes of stored RBCs when
   traveling through human-capillary-like microchannels. Contrary to
   existing knowledge, our results demonstrate that the deformation index
   of RBCs under folding does not change significantly over blood storage.
   However, significant differences exist in time constants and circularity
   distribution widths, which can be used to quantify stored RBC quality or
   age.}},

Abstract = {{As an increasing number of infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) cloud
   providers start to provide cloud computing services, they form a
   competition market to compete for users of these services. Due to
   different resource capacities and service workloads, users may observe
   different finishing times for their cloud computing tasks and experience
   different levels of service qualities as a result. To compete for cloud
   users, it is critically important for each cloud service provider to
   select an ``optimal{''} price that best corresponds to their service
   qualities, yet remaining attractive to cloud users. To achieve this
   goal, the underlying rationale and characteristics in this competition
   market need to be better understood. In this paper, we present an
   in-depth game theoretic study of such a competition market with multiple
   competing IaaS cloud providers. We characterize the nature of
   noncooperative competition in an IaaS cloud market, with a goal of
   capturing how each IaaS cloud provider will select its optimal prices to
   compete with the others. Our analyses lead to sufficient conditions for
   the existence of a Nash equilibrium, and we characterize the equilibrium
   analytically in special cases. Based on our analyses, we propose
   iterative algorithms for IaaS cloud providers to compute equilibrium
   prices, which converge quickly in our study.}},

Abstract = {{The central nervous system (CNS) has a limited capacity to spontaneously
   regenerate following traumatic injury or disease, requiring innovative
   strategies to promote tissue and functional repair. Tissue regeneration
   strategies, such as cell and/or drug delivery, have demonstrated
   promising results in experimental animal models, but have been difficult
   to translate clinically. The efficacy of cell therapy, which involves
   stem cell transplantation into the CNS to replace damaged tissue, has
   been limited due to low cell survival and integration upon
   transplantation, while delivery of therapeutic molecules to the CNS
   using conventional methods, such as oral and intravenous administration,
   have been limited by diffusion across the blood-brain/spinal
   cord-barrier. The use of biomaterials to promote graft survival and
   integration as well as localized and sustained delivery of biologics to
   CNS injury sites is actively being pursued. This review will highlight
   recent advances using biomaterials as cell- and drug-delivery vehicles
   for CNS repair.}},

Title = {{Guided pedicle screw insertion: techniques and training}},
Journal = {{SPINE JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{14}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{165-179}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND CONTEXT: In spinal fusion surgery, the accuracy with which
   screws are inserted in the pedicle has a direct effect on the surgical
   outcome. Accurate placement generally involves considerable judgmental
   skills that have been developed through a lengthy training process.
   Because the impact of misaligning one or more pedicle screws can
   directly affect patient safety, a number of navigational and trajectory
   verification approaches have been described and evaluated in the
   literature to provide some degree of guidance to the surgeon.
   PURPOSE: To provide a concise review to justify the need and explore the
   current state of developing navigational or trajectory verification
   techniques for ensuring proper pedicle screw insertion along with
   simulation methods for better educating the surgical trainees.
   STUDY DESIGN: Recent literature review.
   METHODS: To justify the need to develop new methods for optimizing
   pedicle screw paths, we first reviewed some of the recent publications
   relating to the statistical outcomes for different types of navigation
   along with the conventional freehand (unassisted) screw insertion.
   Second, because of the importance of providing improved training in the
   skill of accurate screw insertion, the training aspects of relevant
   techniques are considered. The third part is devoted to the description
   of specific navigational assist methods or trajectory verification
   techniques and these include computer-assisted navigation,
   three-dimensional simulations, and also electric impedance and optical
   and ultrasonic image-guided methods.
   CONCLUSIONS: This article presents an overview of the need and the
   current status of the guidance methods available for improving the
   surgical outcomes in spinal fusion procedures. It also describes
   educational aids that have the potential for reducing the training
   process. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Finding the target sites of RNA-binding proteins}},
Journal = {{WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-RNA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{5}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{111-130}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{RNA-protein interactions differ from DNA-protein interactions because of
   the central role of RNA secondary structure. Some RNA-binding domains
   (RBDs) recognize their target sites mainly by their shape and geometry
   and others are sequence-specific but are sensitive to secondary
   structure context. A number of small- and large-scale experimental
   approaches have been developed to measure RNAs associated in vitro and
   in vivo with RNA-binding proteins (RBPs). Generalizing outside of the
   experimental conditions tested by these assays requires computational
   motif finding. Often RBP motif finding is done by adapting DNA motif
   finding methods; but modeling secondary structure context leads to
   better recovery of RBP-binding preferences. Genome-wide assessment of
   mRNA secondary structure has recently become possible, but these data
   must be combined with computational predictions of secondary structure
   before they add value in predicting in vivo binding. There are two main
   approaches to incorporating structural information into motif models:
   supplementing primary sequence motif models with preferred secondary
   structure contexts (e.g., MEMERIS and RNAcontext) and directly modeling
   secondary structure recognized by the RBP using stochastic context-free
   grammars (e.g., CMfinder and RNApromo). The former better reconstruct
   known binding preferences for sequence-specific RBPs but are not
   suitable for modeling RBPs that recognize shape and geometry of RNAs.
   Future work in RBP motif finding should incorporate interactions between
   multiple RBDs and multiple RBPs in binding to RNA. (C) 2013 John Wiley

Title = {{Stroop Effects in Alzheimer's Disease: Selective Attention Speed of
   Processing, or Color-naming? A Meta-Analysis}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{4}},
Pages = {{923-938}},
Abstract = {{Selective attention, an essential part of daily activity, is often
   impaired in people with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Usually, it is
   measured by the color-word Stroop test. However, there is no universal
   agreement whether performance on the Stroop task changes significantly
   in AD patients; or if so, whether an increase in Stroop effects reflects
   a decrease in selective attention, a slowing in generalized speed of
   processing (SOP), or is the result of degraded color-vision. The current
   study investigated the impact of AD on Stroop performance and its
   potential sources in a meta-analysis and mathematical modeling of 18
   studies, comparing 637 AD patients with 977 healthy age-matched
   participants. We found a significant increase in Stroop effects for AD
   patients, across studies. This AD-related change was associated with a
   slowing in SOP. However, after correcting for a bias in the distribution
   of latencies, SOP could only explain a moderate portion of the total
   variance (25\%). Moreover, we found strong evidence for an AD-related
   increase in the latency difference between naming the font-color and
   reading color-neutral stimuli (r(2) = 0.98). This increase in the
   dimensional imbalance between color-naming and word-reading was found to
   explain a significant portion of the AD-related increase in Stroop
   effects (r(2) = 0.87), hinting on a possible sensory source. In
   conclusion, our analysis highlights the importance of controlling for
   sensory degradation and SOP when testing cognitive performance and,
   specifically, selective attention in AD patients. We also suggest
   possible measures and tools to better test for selective attention in
   AD.}},

Abstract = {{As older adults age, they are more likely to reside in long-term care
   facilities due to the decline in cognitive and/or physical abilities
   that prevent them from living independently. With a rapidly aging
   population there is an increasing demand on long-term care facilities to
   care for older adults. Such facilities need to provide medical services,
   assistance in activities of daily living, and scheduled leisure
   activities to improve health and quality of life. However, as the need
   for long-term care is increasing, the care workforce is faced with
   decreasing numbers of healthcare staff and high turnover rates. Our
   research focuses on the design of socially assistive robots to plan,
   schedule, and facilitate social and cognitive interventions for
   residents in long-term care facilities. In this paper, we investigate

Abstract = {{A monochromatic continuous wave terahertz source with widely tunable
   frequency range and high resolution has been used to measure the water
   absorption spectrum at temperatures up to 500 degrees C. Experiments are
   carried out based on the HITRAN simulation at different humidity levels.
   The whole THz spectroscopy system was validated with a strong absorption
   peak at 0.557 THz (18.38 cm(-1)) that appears at both room temperature
   and high temperature. We also found that, at high temperatures, new
   absorption peaks at 0.667 THz (22.01 cm(-1)) and 0.88 THz (29.04 cm(-1))
   would emerge, and grow as the water concentration goes up. It provides
   the opportunity to measure the high temperature water vapor (e.g. in a
   furnace) using these new peaks while reducing interference from ambient
   air humidity.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce a new way of constructing and decoding
   multipermutation codes. Multipermutations are permutations of a multiset
   that may consist of duplicate entries. We first introduce a new class of
   matrices called multipermutation matrices. We characterize the convex
   hull of multipermutation matrices. Based on this characterization, we
   propose a new class of codes that we term LP-decodable multipermutation
   codes. Then, we derive two LP decoding algorithms. We first formulate an
   LP decoding problem for memoryless channels. We then derive an LP
   algorithm that minimizes the Chebyshev distance. Finally, we show a
   numerical example of our algorithm.}},

Abstract = {{Direct current (DC) transmission is highly regarded for its ability to
   dynamically decouple AC power systems by segmenting them into disjoint
   networks. Such configurations lead to more efficient power transfers and
   better oscillation damping, but necessitate controllers with seemingly
   heavy communication requirements that rely on wide-area measurement
   systems. This paper shows that DC-segmented power systems are
   poset-causal, making them amenable to powerful decentralized control
   techniques that can substantially reduce their communication needs.
   Specifically, optimal decentralized control is attainable with
   communication only between AC subsystems that are directly connected by
   a DC line. The approach explicitly leverages the implied graph structure
   of power systems with AC and DC lines. Numerical results demonstrate
   that the decentralized controller achieves nearly the same performance
   as the optimal centralized controller.}},

Abstract = {{Architectural complexity continues to grow as we consider the large
   design space of multiple cores, cache architectures, networks-on-chip
   (NoC) and memory controllers. Simulators are growing in complexity to
   reflect these system components. However, many full-system simulators
   fail to utilize the underlying hardware resources such as multiple
   cores; consequently, simulation times have grown significantly. Long
   turnaround times limit the range and depth of design space exploration.
   Communication has emerged as a first class design consideration and has
   led to significant research into NoCs. NoC is yet another component of
   the architecture that must be faithfully modeled in simulation. Here, we
   focus on accelerating NoC simulation through the use of sampling
   techniques. We propose NoCLabs and NoCPoint, two sampling methodologies
   utilizing statistical sampling theory and traffic phase behavior,
   respectively. Experimental results show that NoCLabs and NoCPoint
   estimate NoC performance with an average error of 7\% while achieving
   one order of magnitude speedup.}},

Abstract = {{To enable the adoption of optical Networks-on-Chip (NoCs) and allow them
   to scale to large systems, they must be designed to consume less power
   and energy. Therefore, optical NoCs must use a small number of
   wavelengths, avoid excessive insertion loss and reduce the number of
   microring resonators. We propose the Quartern Topology (QuT), a novel
   low-power all-optical NoC. We also propose a deterministic wavelength
   routing algorithm based on Wavelength Division Multiplexing that allows
   us to reduce the number of wavelengths and microring resonators in
   optical routers. The key advantages of QuT network are simplicity and
   lower power consumption. We compare QuT against three alternative
   all-optical NoCs: optical Spidergon, lambda-router and Corona under
   different synthetic traffic patterns. QuT demonstrates good scalability
   with significantly lower power and competitive latency. Our optical
   topology reduces power by 23\%, 86.3\% and 52.7\% compared with 128-node
   optical Spidergon, lambda-router and Corona, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces research that addresses the subjective measure of
   the customer experience regarding the technical quality of an end-to-end
   Telecom service session. We begin by explaining why the quality of
   customer experience is a crucial consideration for Telecom operators
   that necessitates a Service Quality Experience process for tracking
   customer experience. The customer experience is determined by the entire
   life cycle of a service session, so the assessment of quality must now
   consider three service components: Accessibility, Retainability, and
   Integrity. The traditional Mean Opinion Score (MOS) is concerned with
   the ``integrity{''} or degree of impairment in signal quality. We
   propose to extend the concept of MOS to that of a session MOS (sMOS)
   that encompasses Integrity impairments as well as failures in
   accessibility and retainability. We consider how to incorporate
   traditional MOS assessments into sMOS, and we discuss the choice of
   rating scales for sMOS evaluation. We also consider how to use sMOS to
   track the acceptability of a service to customers. Finally we present a
   case study assessing sMOS experimentally for Over-the Top (OTT)
   progressive video streaming. We conclude by sketching a possible path
   for incorporating our findings into future ITU standards.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the downlink ergodic capacity of a network
   multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. The system model includes
   base-stations (BSs) randomly distributed with a fixed density, each
   equipped with M antennas, scheduling K single-antenna users, and forming
   cooperating clusters via perfect backhaul links. Intra-cluster
   interference is eliminated by joint transmission using zero-forcing
   beamforming assuming perfect channel state information (CSI), while
   inter-cluster interference remains. This paper shows that although
   coordinating a large cluster of BSs eliminates strong interferers, the
   coordination gain depends on the network load factor, defined as the
   relative ratio of M and K. In particular, we show that with M = K,
   increasing the coordination cluster size is only beneficial for the
   cluster-edge users, while degrading the ergodic capacity of the users
   located close to the cluster center. In contrast, when M > K, increasing
   the cluster size potentially improves every user's ergodic capacity. In
   the second part of this paper, we use tools from stochastic geometry to
   account for random BS locations in characterizing the performance of
   network MIMO systems. In this setting, we model the BS locations
   according to a homogeneous Poisson point process with a fixed density,
   and propose tractable, yet accurate, distribution functions for the
   signal and inter-cluster interference powers. We then derive an
   efficiently computable expression for the user ergodic capacity as a
   function of the distance between a user and the cluster center.}},

Abstract = {{Base station (BS) locations are usually modelled using one of two
   extremes: at one end is a deterministic, hexagonal, location model;
   while at the other is a random deployment following a Poisson point
   process (PPP). However, real-world networks follow neither extreme; as
   such, in this paper, we focus on a modified perturbed hexagonal lattice
   model that, in terms of regularity, lies in between the PPP and the
   perfect hexagonal lattice models. In our modified perturbed hexagonal
   lattice, the location of all interfering BSs, except for the serving BS
   under consideration, are perturbed. We provide a simple and tight upper
   bound on the average total interference in an interference-limited
   reuse-1 network. The bound is presented in the form of a polynomial in
   the distance from the serving BS and another polynomial in the
   normalized perturbation. The presented formulation is useful in
   obtaining simple analytical expressions for various network parameters
   such as SIR and/or coverage probability. As an added benefit, the
   formulations here quantify the loss in the coverage probability in
   moving from the perfect lattice model to a random BS deployment. We use
   simulations to illustrate the accuracy of the theory developed.}},

Abstract = {{This paper studies the optimization of transmit beamforming and backhaul
   compression strategies for the uplink of cloud radio access networks
   (C-RAN), in which multi-antenna user terminals communicate with a
   cloud-computing based central processor (CP) through multi-antenna
   base-stations (BSs) serving as relay nodes. The BSs perform
   compress-and-forward strategy to quantize the received signals and send
   the quantization bits to the CP via capacity-limited backhaul links for
   decoding. In contrast to the previous works on the uplink C-RAN, which
   mostly focus on the backhaul compression strategies only, this paper
   proposes the joint optimization of the transmit beamformers and the
   quantization noise covariance matrices at the BSs for maximizing the
   benefit brought by the C-RAN architecture. A weighted sum-rate
   maximization problem is formulated under the user power and backhaul
   capacity constraints. A novel weighted minimum-mean-square-error
   successive convex approximation (WMMSESCA) algorithm is developed for
   finding a local optimum solution to the problem. This paper further
   proposes a low-complexity approximation scheme consisting of beamformers
   matching to the strongest channel vectors at the user side along with
   per-antenna scalar quantizers with uniform quantization noise levels
   across the antennas at each BS. This simple separate design strategy is
   derived by exploring the structure of the optimal solution to the
   sum-rate maximization problem under successive interference cancellation
   (SIC) while assuming high signal-to-quantizationnoise ratio (SQNR).
   Simulation results show that with optimized beamforming and backhaul
   compression, C-RAN can significantly improve the overall performance of
   wireless cellular networks. With SIC, the proposed separate design
   performs very close to the optimized joint design in the SQNR regime of
   practical interest.}},

Abstract = {{Current multipath routing solution in data centers relies on ECMP to
   distribute traffic among all equal-cost paths. It is well known that
   ECMP suffers from two deficiencies. ECMP does not differentiate between
   elephant and mice flows, creates head-of-line blocking for mice flows in
   the egress port buffer, and results in long tail latency. Further it
   does not fully utilize available bandwidth due to hash collision among
   elephant flows. We propose TinyFlow, a simple yet effective approach
   that remedies both problems. TinyFlow changes the traffic
   characteristics of data center networks to be amenable to ECMP by
   breaking elephants into mice. In a network with a large number of mice
   flows only, ECMP naturally balances load and performance is improved. We
   conduct NS-3 simulations and show that TinyFlow provides 20\%-40\%
   speedup in both mean and 99-th percentile FCT for mice, and about 40\%
   throughput improvement for elephants.}},

Abstract = {{Hardened adder and carry logic is widely used in commercial FPGAs to
   improve the efficiency of arithmetic functions. There are many design
   choices and complexities associated with such hardening, including
   circuit design, FPGA architectural choices, and the CAD flow. There has
   been very little study, however, on these choices and hence we explore a
   number of possibilities for hard adder design. We also highlight
   optimizations during front-end elaboration that help ameliorate the
   restrictions placed on logic synthesis by hardened arithmetic. We show
   that hard adders and carry chains, when used for simple adders, increase
   performance by a factor of four or more, but on larger benchmark designs
   that contain arithmetic, improve overall performance by roughly 15\%. We
   measure an average area increase of 5\% for architectures with carry
   chains but believe that better logic synthesis should reduce this
   penalty. Interestingly, we show that adding dedicated inter-logic-block
   carry links or fast carry look-ahead hardened adders result in only
   minor delay improvements for complete designs.}},

Abstract = {{We present a new approach for integrating virtualized FPGA-based
   hardware accelerators into commercialscale cloud computing systems, with
   minimal virtualization overhead. Partially reconfigurable regions across
   multiple FPGAs are offered as generic cloud resources through OpenStack
   (opensource cloud software), thereby allowing users to ``boot{''} custom
   designed or predefined network-connected hardware accelerators with the
   same commands they would use to boot a regular Virtual Machine. We
   propose a hardware and software framework to enable this virtualization.
   This is a first attempt at closely fitting FPGAs into existing cloud
   computing models, where resources are virtualized, flexible, and have
   the illusion of infinite scalability. Our system can set up and tear
   down virtual accelerators in approximately 2.6 seconds on average, much
   faster than regular virtual machines. The static virtualization hardware
   on the physical FPGAs causes only a three cycle latency increase and a
   one cycle pipeline stall per packet in accelerators when compared to a
   non-virtualized system. We present a case study analyzing the design and
   performance of an application-level load balancer using a fully
   implemented prototype of our system. Our study shows that FPGA cloud
   compute resources can easily outperform virtual machines, while the
   system's virtualization and abstraction significantly reduces design
   iteration time and design complexity.}},

Abstract = {{Placement of a large FPGA design now commonly requires several hours,
   significantly hindering designer productivity. Furthermore, FPGA
   capacity is growing faster than CPU speed, which will further increase
   placement time unless new approaches are found. Multi-core processors
   are now ubiquitous, however, and some recent processors also have
   hardware support for transactional memory (TM), making parallelism an
   increasingly attractive approach for speeding up placement. We
   investigate methods to parallelize the simulated annealing placement
   algorithm in VPR, which is widely used in FPGA research. We explore both
   algorithmic changes and the use of different parallel programming
   paradigms and hardware, including TM, thread-level speculation (TLS) and
   lock-free techniques. We find that hardware TM enables large speedups
   (8.1x on average), but compromises ``move fairness{''} and leads to an
   unacceptable quality loss. TLS scales poorly, with a maximum 2.2x
   speedup, but preserves quality. A new dependency checking parallel
   strategy achieves the best balance: the deterministic version achieves
   5.9x speedup and no quality loss, while the non-deterministic, lock-free
   version can scale to a 34x speedup.}},

Abstract = {{In a dense WLAN deployment, the interfering wireless access points (APs)
   need to efficiently share the spectrum, and hence, avoid low-performance
   experience of users due to high collision rates and long backoff

   in which APs can self-configure their channel choices to mitigate
   interference and thereby maximize network throughput. Aiming to minimize
   interference sum utility, a channel assignment problem is formulated as
   a non-convex optimization problem and solved using
   difference-of-convex-functions (DC) programming. Subsequently, two
   distributed algorithms are developed in which each AP independently
   adapts its channel selection to the optimal values over time by
   measuring the received interference in different channels. The
   convergence, complexity, and efficiency of the developed algorithms are

Abstract = {{The autonomous deployment of small Access Points (APs), commonly
   referred to as small cells, provides an economically feasible network
   densification solution to increase the capacity of cellular
   communication systems. However, having a small number of users with a
   single operator and typically employing a single Radio Access Technology
   (RAT) results in suboptimal spectrum utilization at small cells. To
   improve the performance and spectrum utilization at small cells, this
   paper presents a Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) framework that provides
   small cells with secondary access to spectrum primarily assigned to
   other RATs and operators. To avoid the shortcomings of spectrum sensing,
   APs broadcast spectrum occupancy information to facilitate secondary
   spectrum access. System-level simulations, performed for a setup of two
   operators employing two RATs, show substantial performance gains when
   implementing the proposed DSA framework.}},

Abstract = {{We use the wave optical approach to optimize the front surface inverted
   pyramidal grating texture on 2 to 400 mu m thick crystalline silicon in
   order to derive the maximum photocurrent density from the cell. We
   identify a ``one size fits all{''} front grating periodicity of 1000 nm
   for c-Si absorbing layer configured with a back surface reflector that
   maximizes the absorption of normally incident AM1.5g solar spectrum
   irrespective of the layer thickness. With the identification of such
   universal inverted pyramidal grating texture, a common texturing process
   can be developed for high-efficiency devices on thick to thin c-si.
   Furthermore, our studies show that the photocurrent decreases by 0.02
   mA/cm(2) with every nanometer increase in the width of the flat region
   (mesa) between inverted pyramids in the optimum texture. The decrease in
   photocurrent due to reflection from the mesas can be recovered with the
   addition of an antireflective coating of optimum thickness of 80 nm and
   refractive index similar to 2.1.}},

   behavior was quantitatively analyzed. A contrast inversion phenomenon
   was observed in high frequency images which highlights image contrast
   from defective regions against a fading background. High frequency LIC

Abstract = {{Recently we studied communication delay in distributed control of
   untimed discrete-event systems based on supervisor localization. We
   proposed a property called delay-robustness: the overall system behavior
   controlled by distributed controllers with communication delay is
   logically equivalent to its delay-free counterpart. In this paper we
   extend our previous work to timed discrete-event systems, in which
   communication delays are counted by a special clock event tick. First,
   we propose a timed channel model and define timed delay-robustness; for

   the delay-robust property does not hold, we introduce bounded
   delay-robustness, and present an algorithm to compute the maximal delay

   Finally, we demonstrate delay-robustness on the example of an underload

Abstract = {{Subject monitoring and tracking is one of the most appealing classes of
   applications for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Numerous inch scale
   nodes can sense, collect and distribute crucial information with low
   deployment cost. For instance, the movement of endangered species in a
   national park can be monitored with a WSN. However, in such applications
   privacy issues can jeopardize the successful deployment of the network.
   An adversary might trace the network traffic over the same paths and
   eventually locate the source in the network. In this paper, we propose a
   source-location privacy scheme that employs randomly selected
   intermediate nodes based on inclination angles. The introduced
   Angle-based Dynamic Routing Scheme (ADRS) is analysed and is compared
   with the Phantom Single-path Routing Scheme (PSRS). Simulation results
   demonstrate that ADRS improves the safety period and the packet latency.}},

Abstract = {{Modern designs are growing in size and complexity, becoming increasingly
   harder to verify. Today, they are architected to include multiple clock
   domains as a measure to reduce power consumption. Verifying them proves
   to be a computationally intensive and challenging task as it requires
   their clocks to be synchronized. To achieve synchronization, existing
   Boolean satisfiability-based methodologies add hardware to combine the
   clock domains before transforming them into their iterative logic array
   representation (ILA). As a consequence, this results in the addition of
   redundant time-frames adding overhead during verification. This paper
   introduces a novel framework to verify designs with multiple clocks
   using Quantified Boolean Formula satisfiability (QBF). We first present
   a formulation that models an ILA representation with symbolic universal
   quantification to achieve synchronization. This is later extended with
   the use of a clock divider to overcome inefficiencies. The net effect is
   the reduction in the number of redundant time-frames. Furthermore, the
   usage of QBF results in significant memory savings when compared to
   traditional methods. Experiments on bounded model checking demonstrate
   memory reductions of 76\% on average with competitive run-time
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{Distributed generators (DGs) are becoming widely deployed in today's
   power grid. These energy sources are typically sustainable and
   cost-effective but are highly variable based on local environmental
   conditions. This variability poses many challenges to the practical
   deployment of DGs in the grid. In this work, a novel distributed power
   dispatch strategy based on bifurcation control that capitalizes upon the
   recent cyber enablement of the grid is proposed to effectively manage
   DGs implemented at the distribution substation level of the power grid.
   This scheme enables every participating DG to locally compute its
   dispatch strategy based on simple cyber signals broadcasted by the
   utility. Results indicate that the DGs are able to rapidly converge to
   the optimal economical power dispatch with significantly less
   concentrated computational effort and communication overhead.}},

Abstract = {{Flocking control has recently been used in smart grid applications to
   stabilize power systems during a transient instability period. Based on
   consensus and cooperation of multi-agent control systems, flocking
   control uses cyber information about the power system to help achieve
   stability after the occurrence of a fault in the power system. Recent
   work showed that such controller can be useful in a smart power grid;
   however, issues of the controller's power usage, stability time, and
   frequency deviation have not been investigated yet. This paper
   investigates the effect of the power generators' inertia on these issues
   in a WECC 3-generator power system. Results of this work show that the
   location of the fault affects the relationship between the generators'
   inertia and the investigated measures.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic routing is considered an attractive solution for many network
   applications such as monitoring and tracking. In dynamic routing the
   path between the source and the destination can change dynamically
   following the network conditions. Next node selection criteria can have
   a great impact on the selection of each path and as a consequence on the
   network performance. Moreover, each network application may have
   different Quality of Service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we
   examine the impact of the next node selection criteria on the network
   performance. Three routing protocols with different approaches along
   with their routing algorithms are presented. To examine the performance
   of each approach a discrete event simulator is used. It is shown that
   the selection criteria should be carefully designed following the QoS
   requirements of the network application. Furthermore, the obtained
   performance results can be used as an indicator of the appropriateness
   of a dynamic protocol for a variety of applications.}},

Abstract = {{Most mammalian cells (e.g., cancer cells and cardiomyocytes) adhere to a
   culturing surface. Compared to robotic injection of suspended cells
   (e.g., embryos and oocytes), fewer attempts were made to automate the
   injection of adherent cells due to their smaller size, highly irregular
   morphology, small thickness (a few micrometers thick), and large
   variations in thickness across cells. This paper presents a recently
   developed robotic system for automated microinjection of adherent cells.
   The system is embedded with several new capabilities: automatically
   locating micropipette tips; robustly detecting the contact of
   micropipette tip with cell culturing surface and directly with cell
   membrane; and precisely compensating for accumulative positioning
   errors. These new capabilities make it practical to perform adherent
   cell microinjection truly via computer mouse clicking in front of a
   computer monitor, on hundreds and thousands of cells per experiment (vs.
   a few to tens of cells as state-of-the-art). System operation speed,
   success rate, and cell viability rate were quantitatively evaluated
   based on robotic microinjection of over 4,000 cells. This paper also
   reports the use of the new robotic system to perform cell-cell
   communication studies using large sample sizes. The gap junction
   function in a cardiac muscle cell line (HL-1 cells), for the first time,
   was quantified with the system.}},

Abstract = {{The Kleihauer-Betke test (KBT) is a widely used method for measuring
   fetal-maternal hemorrhage (FMH) in maternal care. In hospitals, KBT is
   performed by a certified technologist to count a minimum of 2,000 fetal
   and maternal red blood cells (RBCs) on a blood smear. Manual counting is
   inherently inconsistent and subjective. This paper presents a system for
   automated counting and distinguishing fetal and maternal RBCs on
   clinical KB slides. A custom-adapted hardware platform is used for KB
   slide scanning and image capturing. Spatial-color pixel classification
   with spectral clustering is proposed to separate overlapping cells.
   Optimal clustering number and total cell number are obtained through
   maximizing cluster validity index. To accurately identify fetal RBCs
   from maternal RBCs, multiple features including cell size, shape,
   gradient and saturation difference are used in supervised learning to
   generate feature vectors, to tackle cell color, shape and contrast
   variations across clinical KB slides. The results show that the
   automated system is capable of completing the counting of over 60,000
   cells (vs. 2,000 by technologists) within 5 minutes (vs. 15 minutes by
   technologists). The counting results are highly accurate and correlate
   strongly with those from benchmarking flow cytometry measurement.}},

Abstract = {{One major challenge for untethered micro-scale mobile robotics is the
   manipulation of external objects in the robot's three-dimensional (3D)
   work environment. Here, we present a method to use the capillary force
   at a solid-liquid-gas interface to reversibly attach objects to a mobile
   magnetic microrobot. This is accomplished by the addition of a cavity in
   the hydrophobic microrobot, in which an air bubble is captured when the
   microrobot is placed in a water environment. The extension of the air
   bubble from the cavity is adjusted dynamically by controlling the
   pressure of the workspace environment. A peak switching ratio between
   the maximum and minimum gripping forces of 14:1 is shown for controlled
   attachment/detachment experiments, which allows for reliable
   pick-and-place operation. This work introduces an analytical capillary
   adhesion model and demonstrates control of the bubble size for
   pick-and-place gripping. A proof-of-concept demonstration of 3D
   manipulation in a fluidic environment shows the potential of capillary
   gripping for future use in confined environments such as inside
   microfluidic devices for transportation or assembly of hydrophobic
   objects.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper we present the development of a novel multi-user
   human-robot interaction (HRI) system architecture to allow the social
   robot Tangy to autonomously plan, schedule and facilitate multi-user

   activities, the robot is able to interact with a group of users by
   providing both group-based and individualized assistance based on the
   current state of the activity and the needs of the individual users
   engaged in the social interactions. Such planning and scheduling of
   daily activities of a social robot while reasoning about multiple user
   schedules has not yet been addressed in the literature. Herein, the HRI
   multi-user activities we consider are a series of Bingo games. System
   performance experiments presented in the paper validate the use of the
   proposed multiuser system architecture in: 1) planning and scheduling
   daily Bingo games for Tangy to facilitate while considering the
   individual schedules of the users, and 2) determining the appropriate
   behaviors of the robot with respect to individuals and groups of people
   while providing game reminders prior to a Bingo game starting and also

   is studied. We consider a microgrid powered by a conventional generator
   (CG) and multiple renewable generators (RGs) each co-located with one
   distributed storage (DS) unit. An aggregator operates the microgrid and
   aims to minimize the long-term system cost, including all RGs' cost, the
   CG's cost, and the cost for exploiting external energy markets. We
   jointly manage the supply side, demand side, and DS units, taking into
   account the randomness of the system, and incorporating the ramping
   constraint of the CG. A real-time algorithm is proposed, which does not
   require any statistics of the system. We analytically characterize the
   gap between the system cost under our algorithm and the minimum cost,
   demonstrating that our algorithm is asymptotically optimal as the DS
   energy capacity increases and the CG ramping constraint loosens. In
   simulation, we compare the proposed algorithm with a greedy algorithm as
   well as a lower bound on the optimum. Simulation shows that our
   algorithm outperforms the greedy one and its performance can be close to
   the optimum even with small DS units.}},

Abstract = {{A parametric game-theoretic controller is proposed to stabilize power
   systems during and after cyber switching attacks. The attacks are based
   on calculated switchings of external power sources in order to
   destabilize the power system. The controller relies on receiving timely
   information from the cyber component of the smart grid to control the
   output of fast-acting external power sources in order to balance the
   swing equation of the system. In this regard, game-theoretic analysis is
   applied to devise reactive strategies for the controller to drive the
   frequency of the system's generators to stability. The proposed
   controller gives system operators the flexibility to meet constraints on
   external power while achieving an acceptable stability time. Numerical
   results show the usefulness of the proposed controller in stabilizing
   the WECC 3-generator power system during and after a switching attack.}},

Abstract = {{Ecological Interface Design (EID) is usually associated with applying
   Work Domain Analysis and developing customized control tools for
   specific, stable systems governed by causal work domain constraints.
   However, for domains with weaker, intentional, less specific
   constraints, EID based on analysis of cognitive strategies has been
   proposed, and demonstrated using metaphorical iconic forms. EID methods
   to find invariant strategies in intentional work domains are less
   developed. Such methods may be a way to generalize ecological interfaces
   beyond specific instances of complex systems. An example developed for
   an energy efficiency monitoring application is presented and discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Hidden within the relative location of tags in images is a relational
   model that can identify how close two individuals are, or, the affinity
   of a person to an object or a brand. Based on this model we can 1)
   better understand the relationship between users/tags, 2) find photos
   where a user is pictured but not tagged in, and 3) enable searching
   ``inside{''} images by clicking on any location within an image to start
   a search. This paper proposes a method of modeling the relationship
   between objects based on their spatial arrangement in a set of tagged
   images. Based on the relative coordinates of each object tag, we compute
   a joint relativity between each tag pair, generate a social relationship
   graph and propose an efficient image search method using the joint
   Relativity graph. We evaluated our approach with real world data from
   Facebook, showing a direct relationship between the number of tagged
   photos and the amount of information obtained from these photos, and an
   average correlation coefficient of 0.8 between user-generated relativity
   scores and those obtained by our algorithm.}},

   In order to analyze pigmented skin lesions we localize potential moles
   of different sizes utilizing multiple difference of Gaussian filters and
   apply trained Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors to
   eliminate non-mole candidates from the previous stage. After finding
   mole candidates we present information about the symmetry and border
   irregularity of candidate moles. To test real-time performance of our
   system a prototype application on iPhone 4S and iPhone 5S was

   scaling factors for stable teleoperation based on the impedance models
   of master, slave and estimated impedance of the environment. Feasibility
   and accuracy of an online environment impedance estimation method are
   analyzed through simulations and experiments. Then the proposed adaptive

Abstract = {{We consider a coordinated multi-point (COW) uplink cellular network with
   a Poisson point process (PPP) model for the position of BSs. Our model
   assumes cooperation amongst two BSs and the required density is obtained
   under shadowing and Rayleigh fading for different LTE-A path loss
   models. We obtain accurate closed-form approximations for the worst-case
   rate coverage probability within the cooperation region. The
   approximations presented are useful for a rapid assessment of network
   performance and can be utilized in parametric studies for network
   design. Here, they are applied to obtain the required density of BSs to
   achieve a target rate coverage probability. As an added benefit, the
   formulation here quantifies the penalty in moving from a regular BS
   deployment (the grid model) to a random BS deployment (the PPP model).}},

Abstract = {{The main limitation of deploying/updating Received Signal Strength (RSS)
   based indoor localization is the construction of fingerprinted radio
   map, which is quite a hectic and time-consuming process especially when
   the indoor area is enormous and/or dynamic. Different approaches have
   been undertaken to reduce such deployment/update efforts, but the
   performance degrades when the fingerprinting load is reduced below a
   certain level. In this paper, we propose an indoor localization scheme
   that requires as low as 1\% fingerprinting load. This scheme employs
   unsupervised manifold alignment that takes crowd sourced RSS readings
   and localization requests as source data set and the environment's plan
   coordinates as destination data set. The 1\% fingerprinting load is only
   used to perturb the local geometries in the destination data set. Our
   proposed algorithm was shown to achieve less than 5 m mean localization
   error with 1\% fingerprinting load and a limited number of crowd sourced
   readings, when other learning based localization schemes pass the 10 m
   mean error with the same information.}},

Abstract = {{This work systematically explores what limits the operation frequency in
   a typical general purpose, soft processor design on a modern FPGA. The
   analysis mirrors a typical design cycle: It starts from a base
   implementation of a 5-stage pipelined core where correctness,
   modularity, and speed of development are the primary considerations. The
   analysis then proceeds in a series of identify-and-then-revise steps. At
   each step, the analysis identifies the critical path and then
   ``removes{''} it. The result is a list of components and mechanisms that
   restrict the frequency of operation. A designer would have to cleverly
   redesign over these paths in order to improve the processor's operating
   clock frequency. Using the results of this analysis, this work proposes
   various optimizations to improve the efficiency of some of these
   components. The optimizations increase the processor clock frequency
   from 145MHz to 281MHz on Stratix III devices, while overall instruction
   processing throughput increases by 80\%.}},

   case where the signal, during propagation, under goes phase
   perturbations. In this paper we consider waveform design with the
   peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), an issue of practical importance.
   Furthermore, we couple the design of the waveform with an adaptive
   receiver and obtain, simultaneously, the weights in an adaptive adaptive
   matched filter. An example of a clutter and target model is provided to
   show how the optimal waveform design improves the detection performance
   of a random-phase radar compared to traditional waveforms.}},

   While the developed method itself is novel in sleep monitoring, due to

   pave the way for later analysis on monitoring consciousness with 40-Hz

Abstract = {{We introduce Stage-aware Anomaly Detection (SAAD), a low-overhead
   real-time solution for detecting runtime anomalies in storage systems.
   Modern storage server architectures are multithreaded and structured as
   a set of modules, which we call stages. SAAD leverages this to collect
   stage-level log summaries at runtime and to perform statistical analysis
   across stage instances. Stages that generate rare execution flows and/or
   register unusually high duration for regular flows at run-time indicate
   anomalies. SAAD makes two key contributions: i) limits the search space
   for root causes, by pinpointing specific anomalous code stages, and ii)
   reduces compute and storage requirements for log analysis, while
   preserving accuracy, through a novel technique based on log
   summarization. We evaluate SAAD on three distributed storage systems:
   HBase, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and Cassandra. We show
   that, with practically zero overhead, we uncover various anomalies in
   real-time.}},

Abstract = {{We sought to explore the biological mechanisms by which endosseous
   implant surface topography contributes to bone anchorage. To address
   this experimentally, we implanted five groups of custom-made
   commercially pure titanium implants of varying surface topographical
   complexity in rat femora for 9 days; subjected them to mechanical
   testing; and then examined the interfacial bone matrix by electron
   microscopy. The five implant surfaces were prepared by combinations of
   dual acid etching and grit blasting the titanium substrates and, in some
   cases, modifying the created surfaces with the deposition of
   nanocrystals of calcium phosphate, which resulted in 10 samples per
   group. In parallel, we cultured rat bone marrow cells on surrogate
   implants constructed from polymer resin coated with the same calcium
   phosphate nanocrystals, and monitored the deposition of bone
   sialoprotein by transmission electron immunohisto-micrography. We found
   that implant samples modified with sub-micron scale crystals were
   bone-bonding, as described by the interdigitation of a mineralized
   cement line matrix with the underlying implant surface. The in vitro
   assay showed that bone sialoprotein could be deposited in the
   interstices between, and undercuts below, the nanocrystals. In addition,
   when mineralized, the cement line matrix globules occupied micron-sized
   pits in the implant surfaces, and in part obliterated them, creating an
   additional form of anchorage. Our results also showed that collagen,
   elaborated by the osteogenic cells, wrapped around the coarse-micron
   features, and became mineralized in the normal course of bone formation.
   This provided a mechanism by which coarse-micron implant features
   contributed to a functional interface, which we have previously
   described, that is capable of resisting the mechanical loading that
   increases as pen-implant bone matures. Thus, our findings provide
   mechanistic explanations for the biologically-relevant criteria that can
   be employed to assess the importance of implant surface topography at
   different scale-ranges. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Bone loss occurs as a consequence of a variety of diseases as well as
   from traumatic injuries, and often requires therapeutic intervention.
   Strategies for repairing and replacing damaged and/or lost bone tissue
   include the use of biomaterials and medical implant devices with and
   without osteoinductive coatings. The soluble growth factor
   angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) has been found to promote cell adhesion and
   survival in a range of cell types including cardiac myocytes,
   endothelial cells and fibroblasts through an integrin-dependent
   mechanism. Furthermore, the short sequence QHREDGS has been identified
   as the integrin-binding sequence of Ang-1, and as a synthetic peptide it
   has been found to show similar integrin-dependent effects as Ang-1 in
   the aforementioned cell types. Integrins have been implicated in
   osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization, processes critical
   to bone regeneration. By binding integrins on the osteoblast surface,
   QHREDGS could promote cell survival and adhesion, as well as conceivably
   osteoblast differentiation and bone mineralization. Here we immobilized
   QHREDGS onto polyacrylate (PA)coated titanium (Ti) plates and
   polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogels. The osteoblast differentiation
   marker, alkaline phosphatase, peaked in activity 4-12 days earlier on
   the QHREDGS-immobilized PA-coated Ti plates than on the unimmobilized,
   DGQESHR (scrambled)- and RGDS-immobilized surfaces. Significantly more
   bone matrix was deposited on the QHREDGS-immobilized Ti surface than on
   the other surfaces as determined by atomic force microscopy. The
   QHREDGS-immobilized hydrogels also had a significantly higher
   mineral-to-matrix (M/M) ratio determined by Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy. Alizarin Red S and von Kossa staining and quantification,
   and environmental scanning electron microscopy showed that while both
   the QHREDGS- and RGDS-immobilized surfaces had extensive mineralization
   relative to the unimmobilized and DGQESHR-immobilized surfaces, the
   mineralization was more considerable on the QHREDGS- immobilized
   surface, both with and without the induction of osteoblast
   differentiation. Finally, treatment of cell monolayers with soluble
   QHREDGS was demonstrated to upregulate osteogenic gene expression. Taken
   together, these results demonstrate that the QHREDGS peptide is
   osteoinductive, inducing osteoblast differentiation, bone matrix
   deposition and mineralization.}},

   develop alternative sources and methods of replacing tissue damaged by
   cardiovascular diseases. This chapter discusses the design criteria for
   injectable biomaterials used in cardiac tissue engineering and for
   direct in vivo application as well as the biomolecules used to enhance
   these novel therapies. The challenges facing the field and future

Abstract = {{This work outlines the synthesis and characterization of a green epoxy
   resin derived from bark extractives. The resins were prepared at various

   characterize the chemical structures of extractive-based epoxy (E-epoxy)
   monomers. Measurement results indicated successful epoxidation of bark
   extractives after reaction with epichlorohydrin. GPC results revealed
   that the molecular weights and polydispersities of E-epoxy monomers were
   lower than those of lignin epoxy (L-epoxy) monomers. The curing kinetic
   parameters calculated by the Kissinger method and the Model-Free method
   showed that E-epoxy had a lower curing activation energy value than
   petroleum-based epoxy (P-epoxy). E-epoxy displayed tensile strength and
   thermal stability comparable to P-epoxy. The research outcome
   demonstrated there is promise of using bark extractives to synthesize
   epoxy resins replacing toxic bisphenol A.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes a high step-up, transformerless, dc/dc converter
   suitable for applications where high efficiency at low power throughput
   is required. The proposed converter achieves high step-up dc/dc
   conversion through a resonant LC tank and realizes high-efficiency
   operation via the soft-switching enabled by this resonant network. Flat
   efficiency is obtained via discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation
   of the converter. A burst operating mode is proposed for achieving
   increased efficiency operation. Finally, a 100V/800V, 650W prototype is
   implemented to experimentally validate the converter's operation, and
   flat efficiencies are measured over a wide operating range.}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work is to demonstrate a temperature-dependent
   impedance model for high-power lithium-ion polymer cells used in modern
   Electric Vehicles (EV). The impedance model is combined with a
   self-heating thermal model for system simulations, in order to predict
   the impact of different cell types on the overall EV performance, under
   real-world urban and highway drive-cycles. Measurements show that the
   internal resistance is almost doubled when the ambient temperature is
   lowered from 20 degrees C to 5 degrees C. This has a drastic impact on
   the EV's ability to satisfy the load current requirements without
   performance lags, and justfiies the importance of the modelling
   approach. When operating in cold climates, it is observed that the
   Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS) must strike a balance between
   EV range and performance, as the stored energy should be optimally
   distributed between the propulsion and heating systems.}},

Title = {{Sparse Beamforming and User-Centric Clustering for Downlink Cloud Radio
   Access Network}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{2}},
Pages = {{1326-1339}},
Abstract = {{This paper considers a downlink cloud radio access network (C-RAN) in
   which all the base-stations (BSs) are connected to a central computing
   cloud via digital backhaul links with finite capacities. Each user is
   associated with a user-centric cluster of BSs; the central processor
   shares the user's data with the BSs in the cluster, which then
   cooperatively serve the user through joint beamforming. Under this
   setup, this paper investigates the user scheduling, BS clustering, and
   beamforming design problem from a network utility maximization
   perspective. Differing from previous works, this paper explicitly
   considers the per-BS backhaul capacity constraints. We formulate the
   network utility maximization problem for the downlink C-RAN under two
   different models depending on whether the BS clustering for each user is
   dynamic or static over different user scheduling time slots. In the
   former case, the user-centric BS cluster is dynamically optimized for
   each scheduled user along with the beamforming vector in each
   time-frequency slot, whereas in the latter case, the user-centric BS
   cluster is fixed for each user and we jointly optimize the user
   scheduling and the beamforming vector to account for the backhaul
   constraints. In both cases, the nonconvex per-BS backhaul constraints
   are approximated using the reweighted l(1)-norm technique. This
   approximation allows us to reformulate the per-BS backhaul constraints
   into weighted per-BS power constraints and solve the weighted sum rate
   maximization problem through a generalized weighted minimum mean square
   error approach. This paper shows that the proposed dynamic clustering
   algorithm can achieve significant performance gain over existing naive
   clustering schemes. This paper also proposes two heuristic static
   clustering schemes that can already achieve a substantial portion of the
   gain.}},

Title = {{Designing Truthful Spectrum Double Auctions with Local Markets}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MOBILE COMPUTING}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{13}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{75-88}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Market-driven spectrum auctions offer an efficient way to improve
   spectrum utilization by transferring unused or underused spectrum from
   its primary license holder to spectrum-deficient secondary users. Such a
   spectrum market exhibits strong locality in two aspects: 1) that
   spectrum is a local resource and can only be traded to users within the
   license area, and 2) that holders can partition the entire license areas
   and sell any pieces in the market. We design a spectrum double auction
   that incorporates such locality in spectrum markets, while keeping the
   auction economically robust and computationally efficient. Our designs
   are tailored to cases with and without the knowledge of bid
   distributions. Complementary simulation studies show that spectrum
   utilization can be significantly improved when distribution information
   is available. Therefore, an auctioneer can start from one design without
   any a priori information, and then switch to the other alternative after
   accumulating sufficient distribution knowledge. With minor
   modifications, our designs are also effective for a profit-driven
   auctioneer aiming to maximize the auction revenue.}},

   constant step-sizes requires less information aggregation, but only
   reaches an approximation of a Nash equilibrium. We show that by

Abstract = {{Two frequency-domain methods for predicting phonon frequencies and

   methods draw input from molecular dynamics simulations and lattice
   dynamics calculations, but differ in the form of the phonon spectral
   energy density. One phonon spectral energy density expression (referred
   to as 43) can be formally derived from lattice dynamics theory. A
   similar approach in the time domain has been validated {[}Turney et al.
   Phys. Rev. B 79, 224305 (2009)]. The other phonon spectral energy
   denSity expression (referred to as Phi) has been proposed {[}Thomas et
   al., Phys. Rev. B 81, 081411(R) (2010)] but not validated. The
   expressions for Phi and Phi are presented and then applied to predict
   the phonon properties and thermal conductivities of three systems:
   Lennard-Jones argon, Stillinger-Weber silicon, and a carbon nanotube
   modeled using the Reactive Empirical Bond Order potential. (V does not
   capture the total phonon spectral energy density predicted by <13 and
   therefore cannot correctly predict the phonon lifetimes or thermal
   conductivity. Its use in future work is discouraged and we recommend the
   use of cl).}},

Abstract = {{We introduce the microfluidic organoids for drug screening (MODS)
   platform, a digital microfluidic system that is capable of generating
   arrays of individually addressable, free-floating, three-dimensional
   hydrogel-based microtissues (or `organoids'). Here, we focused on liver
   organoids, driven by the need for early-stage screening methods for
   hepatotoxicity that enable a ``fail early, fail cheaply{''} strategy in
   drug discovery. We demonstrate that arrays of hepatic organoids can be
   formed from co-cultures of HepG2 and NIH-3T3 cells embedded in hydrogel
   matrices. The organoids exhibit fibroblast-dependent contractile
   behaviour, and their albumin secretion profiles and cytochrome P450 3A4
   activities are better mimics of in vivo liver tissue than comparable
   two-dimensional cell culture systems. As proof of principle for
   screening, MODS was used to generate and analyze the effects of a
   dilution series of acetaminophen on apoptosis and necrosis. With further
   development, we propose that the MODS platform may be a cost-effective
   tool in a ``fail early, fail cheaply{''} paradigm of drug development.}},

Abstract = {{Prediction of neural activity relating to movement is essential to
   understanding and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases and cybernetic
   interfaces. Here we had shown that it is possible to decode deep brain
   local field potentials (LFPs) related to movements and its laterality,
   left or right sided visually cued movements using Probabilistic Neural
   Network (PNN) classifier. The frequency related components of LFPs were
   extracted using the wavelet packet transform (WPT). Then the signal
   features were computed as the instantaneous power of each band using the
   Hilbert Transform (HT) with defined windows for motor response. Based on
   the extracted feature, PNN classifier was designed and evaluated using
   10-fold cross validation method to identify the robustness for
   predicting movements. The Classification accuracy 82.72 +/- 7.2 \%
   achieved for distinguishing movement condition from the rest. While for
   subsequent discrimination of left and right movement, the accuracy
   reached up to 74.96 +/- 10.5 \%. Considering the classification
   performance (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and the area under the
   Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC) curve), PNN classifier
   successfully achieved better than chance level. The proposed modality
   and computational process may promisingly effective and powerful method
   to open up several possibilities for improving BMI applications,
   diagnosis of chronic neurological disorders and robust monitoring system
   with propitious result.}},

Abstract = {{High-Level-Synthesis (HLS) tools translate a software description of an
   application into custom FPGA logic, increasing designer productivity vs.
   Hardware Description Language (HDL) design flows. Overlays seek to
   further improve productivity by reducing application compile times and
   raising abstraction by enabling the designer to target a
   software-programmable substrate instead of the underlying FPGA. We
   compare the performance, development effort and scalability of two
   C-to-FPGA approaches: our TILT overlay processor and Altera's OpenCL
   HLS. Our application-customized TILT implementations of five
   data-parallel benchmarks have from 41\% to 80\% of the throughput per
   unit of layout area achieved by our best OpenCL HLS designs. The time
   required for initial hardware compilation of these TILT designs and
   configuration of the target application onto the overlay is roughly
   comparable to the compile times of the OpenCL HLS designs: 28 and 103
   minutes on average respectively. However subsequent reconfigurations due
   to changes in the application that do not require re-synthesis of the
   overlay are fast, taking 38 seconds on average. In contrast, OpenCL HLS
   applications require full recompilation after every code change. TILT
   also enables smaller, more area-efficient designs than OpenCL HLS when
   low to moderate throughput is sufficient. For high throughput, the
   larger spatially pipelined designs of OpenCL HLS are preferable.}},

Abstract = {{Implementing systems on FPGA soft-processors, rather than as custom
   hardware, eases and accelerates the development process, but at the cost
   of a great reduction in performance. Orthogonal to limitations in
   parallelism or clock frequency, this reduction in performance primarily
   originates in the intrinsic addressing and flow-control overheads of
   scalar microprocessors, which expend a considerable number of cycles
   interleaving address calculations and branch decisions within the actual
   useful work. We present an improved FPGA soft-processor architecture
   which statically overlaps ``overhead{''} computations and executes them
   in parallel with the ``useful{''} computations, significantly reducing
   the number of processor cycles needed to execute sequential programs,
   while reducing maximum clock frequency to 0.939x of its original value.
   In addition to eliminating almost all overhead computations, the
   proposed soft-processor can operate at 500 MHz on the Altera Stratix IV
   FPGA -0.909x of the absolute maximum rating. Combined, the high speed
   and execution efficiency increase the range of FPGA designs amenable to
   soft-processors rather than custom hardware. We evaluate our cycle count
   improvements with multiple benchmarks, achieving speedups ranging from
   1.07x for control-heavy code, to 1.92x for looping code, never
   performing worse than the original sequential code, and always
   performing better than a totally unrolled loop.}},

   method for a 4 x 4 real matrix. The coordinate rotation digital computer
   (CORDIC) algorithm is adopted and modified to speed up and simplify the
   Givens rotation. To verify the function and evaluate the performance,
   the proposed architectures are validated on a Virtex 5 FPGA development
   platform. Compared to a commercial implementation of vectoring CORDIC,
   an enhanced vectoring CORDIC is presented that uses 37.7\% less hardware
   resources, dissipates 76.8\% less power and provides a 1.8 times
   speed-up while maintaining the same computation accuracy. The novel QR
   systolic array architecture based on the enhanced vectoring CORDIC saves
   5\% in hardware and the throughput is improved by a factor of two with

Abstract = {{We analyze the fundamental performance impact of enforcing a fixed order
   of synchronization operations to achieve weak deterministic execution.
   Our analysis is in three parts, performed on a real system using the
   SPLASH-2 and PARSEC benchmarks. First, we quantify the impact of various
   sources of nondeterminism on execution of data-race-free programs. We
   find that thread synchronization is the prevalent source of
   nondeterminism, sometimes affecting program output. Second, we divorce
   the implementation overhead of a system imposing a specific
   synchronization order from the impact of enforcing this order. We show
   that this fundamental cost of determinism is small (slowdown of 4\% on
   average and 32\% in the worst case) and we identify application
   characteristics responsible for this cost. Finally, we evaluate this
   cost under perturbed execution conditions. We find that demanding
   determinism when threads face such conditions can cause almost 2x
   slowdown.}},

Abstract = {{A compressed air sprayer was used to spray model paint onto two glass
   substrates at the same time. Afterwards, one glass substrate was placed
   on a LED light source and still photographs were taken from the top
   using a DSLR camera with a timer system. The other substrate was put on
   a balance to record weight. Pictures and weight measurements were taken
   at 5 second intervals for 15 minutes. The sprayed film thickness was
   varied. The pictures were analyzed using ImageJ software. Bubble Count
   vs. Time, Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) of Bubbles vs. Time as well as
   Weight vs. Time was plotted. It was seen that the pace of weight loss
   was faster for thinner films The rate of bubble escape also depended on
   film thickness. It took a longer time for thicker films to lose the
   bubbles entrapped in them. In the first 30 seconds, large bubbles
   escaped due to buoyancy forces and afterwards surface tension driven
   flows became dominant. There was also a lot of bubble movement in
   thicker films. The effect of gravity was studied as well. Gravity did
   not affect the bubble escape rate since a downward facing film had the
   same bubble count as an upward facing film confirming that bubble motion
   was not due to buoyancy forces alone. However, the SMD of bubbles in a
   downward facing film was larger than an upward facing film. Buoyancy is
   not a factor in bubble escape from the downward facing film and only
   surface-tension driven flows play a role.}},

Abstract = {{Separating oil from solid particles is of great importance in many
   industrial processes including the extraction of bitumen from oil sands,
   and the remediation of oil spills. The usual approach is to separate the
   oil from the solid by introducing another liquid (e.g. water).
   Separation is often assisted by fluid mixing, and chemical addition. Yet
   while oil-water-particle separation has been well studied from a
   chemical standpoint, little research has taken into account the effect
   of hydrodynamics on separation. In this work, the separation of oil from
   a single oil-coated spherical particle falling through an aqueous
   solution was evaluated as a function of viscosity ratio. Solvents were
   used to modify the viscosity of the oil. The experiments were recorded
   using a high-speed camera and post-processed using the MATLAB
   image-processing toolbox. A CFD model has also been developed to study
   this phenomenon.
   The results indicate that when viscous forces are strong enough, the oil
   film deforms, flows to the back of the sphere, and forms a tail that
   eventually breaks up into a series of droplets due to a capillary wave
   instability. When the viscosity ratio is small (i.e. the oil is less
   viscous than the solution), a thin tail forms quickly, the growth rate
   of the instability is high, and hence the tail breaks very quickly into
   smaller droplets. When the viscosity ratio is high (i.e. the oil is more
   viscous), more time is required for the deformation/separation to
   initiate, and the tail is thicker and breaks more slowly into larger
   droplets. It was observed that when the viscosity ratio is close to 1,
   the rate of separation is increased and maximum. separation is achieved.}},

   the design space. The architecture then configures a system from the
   reduced design space-using a genetic algorithm to minimize the system
   lifetime cost subject to system constraints. The genetic algorithm uses
   a detailed cost model and physics-based PVRO system model which
   determines the ability of the system to meet demand. Determining the
   ability to meet demand is challenging due to variations in water demand
   and solar radiation. Here, the community's historical water demand,
   solar radiation history, and PVRO system physics are used in a Markov
   model to quantify the ability of a system to meet demand or the
   loss-of-water probability (LOWP). Case studies demonstrate the approach
   and the cost-reliability trade-off for community-scale PVRO systems. In
   addition, long duration simulations are used to demonstrate the Markov
   model appropriately captures the uncertainty.}},

Abstract = {{An electrostatic actuator is designed to move a 1 mm mirror 58 mu m out
   of plane at 25 volts. Large out-of-plane displacement is obtained from
   repulsive forces generated on four sets of comb drive fingers attached
   to the mirror plate in the middle. The proposed actuator is a customized
   design of a previous study for low voltage applications. The static
   modeling of the actuator was performed using a coupled-field finite
   element model of the actuator, including mechanical and electrical
   domains. Low voltage operation is achieved by decreasing the finger
   width and the lateral spacing, which increased the generated repulsive
   force at a specified voltage in a unit cell of the actuator. Decreasing
   the lateral spacing also enabled increasing the number of fingers, which
   could increase the repulsive-force, and consequently the torque and the
   rotation angles when the vertical gap between moving and fixed fingers
   is small. However, the redesigned actuator has a lower stiffness
   compared to the previous design. The actuator is optimized for
   auto-focusing applications in cell phone cameras that require voltages
   below 30 Volts for user safety. In the intended auto focusing module,
   the actuators do not carry the lens and auto-focusing is obtained by
   moving the mirror attached to the actuators.}},

Abstract = {{We examined online product reviews as a source of novel affordances.
   Certain affordances may only be discovered through extended use across
   various environments. User generated reviews may thus contain unique
   insights. We analyzed online consumer product reviews from Canadian
   Tire, one of Canada's largest retailers. We determined properties of
   this collection of reviews and commonalities between valuable reviews.
   In addition to typical challenges associated with natural-language
   processing, e.g. word-sense disambiguation, we identify characteristics
   of online consumer reviews that create additional challenges. These
   challenges include the use of `wild English' and sarcasm in online
   reviews.
   We first present criteria to define and more objectively identify novel
   affordances from review content. Next, k-means clustering reveals that a
   combination of syntactical features and high frequency word percentages
   can separate descriptive from non-descriptive review content. Finally,
   we identified cue phrases that may indicate higher likelihood of
   affordance content in a review. Despite existing obstacles, the
   substantial volume of available online product reviews has potential to
   become a valuable source of affordances and feedback for designers and
   retailers alike.}},

Abstract = {{The natural-language approach to identifying biological analogies
   exploits the existing format of much biological knowledge, beyond
   databases created for biomimetic design. However, designers may need to
   select analogies from search results, during which biases may exist
   towards: specific words in descriptions of biological phenomena,
   familiar organisms and scales, and strategies that match preconceived
   solutions.
   Therefore, we conducted two experiments to study the effect of
   abstraction on overcoming these biases and selecting biological
   phenomena based on analogical similarities. Abstraction in our
   experiments involved replacing biological nouns with hypernyms. The
   first experiment asked novice designers to choose between a phenomenon
   suggesting a highly useful strategy for solving a given problem, and
   another suggesting a less-useful strategy, but featuring bias elements.
   The second experiment asked novice designers to evaluate the relevance
   of two biological phenomena that suggest similarly useful strategies to
   solve a given problem.
   Neither experiment demonstrated the anticipated benefits of abstraction.
   Instead, our abstraction led to: 1) novice designers associating
   non-abstracted words to design problems and 2) increased difficulty in
   understanding descriptions of biological phenomena. We recommend
   investigating other ways in which abstraction can be implemented when
   designing similar tools or techniques that aim to support biomimetic
   design and other design-by-analogy work.}},

Abstract = {{We originally studied affordances to design products that encourage
   resource-efficient behavior in users. This paper was motivated by the
   observation that a lack of resources affected the ability of
   impoverished slum residents to perceive affordances. Data gathered from
   a trip to Bangladesh support recent postulations that affordance
   perception depends on user intention and socio-cultural norms, which are
   also influenced by fixation and training. We thus became interested in
   how absence, whether of material, components, or entire products,
   affected the utility of objects. We describe three dimensions of
   absence, one major and two minor. The major dimension is used to express
   the range of physical absence, i.e., of material in a part, of a part in
   a product, and of the entire product. Minor dimensions include the
   extent of user control and the permanence of absence, each of which can
   be used to increase utility in objects. We provide existing examples
   along these dimensions and describe concepts along the major, physical
   dimension of absence. We propose that the affordance of absence can be
   used as an approach to identify novel affordances, and conclude by
   placing it in the context of existing affordance-based design methods.}},

Abstract = {{Hand gesture recognition plays a vital role in developing vision-based
   communication for human-computer interaction. This paper presents a
   novel static hand gesture recognition method using the two dimensional
   Zernike moments (2D ZMs) those are considered as effective features when
   patterns in images possess distortions due to rotation, scaling or
   viewing angle. The key contribution of this paper lies in the fact that
   a discriminative set of ZMs are used to represent features of the hand
   postures as opposed to traditional features obtained from heuristic
   choice of fixed-order moments. The orthogonal nature of the 2D ZMs
   allows the estimation of the discrimination power of the individual
   moments by using the inter-and intraclass variances of the features. The
   nearest neighbor classifier is employed on the discriminative ZMs (DZMs)
   to recognize the hand postures in a computationally efficient way.
   Experimental results on commonly-referred database show that the
   proposed DZM-based method provides recognition accuracies better than
   that provided by the conventional principal component analysis, Fourier
   descriptor or existing ZM-based methods.}},

Abstract = {{Communications systems make heavy use of FPGAs; their programmability
   allows system designers to keep up with emerging protocols and their
   high-speed transceivers enable high bandwidth designs. While FPGAs are
   extensively used for packet parsing, inspection and classification, they
   have seen less use as the switch fabric between network ports. However,
   recent work has proposed embedding a network on-chip (NoC) as a new
   ``hard{''} resource on FPGAs and we show that by properly leveraging
   such a NoC one can create a very efficient yet still highly programmable
   network switch. We compare a NoC-based 16 x 16 network switch for
   10-Gigabit Ethernet traffic to a recent innovative FPGA-based switch
   fabric design. The NoC-based switch not only consumes 5.8x less logic
   area, but also reduces latency by 8.1x. We also show that using the
   FPGA's programmable interconnect to adjust the packet injection points
   into the NoC leads to significant performance improvements. A routing
   algorithm tailored to this application is shown to further improve
   switch performance and scalability. Overall, we show that an FPGA with a
   low-cost hard 64-node mesh NoC with 64-bit links can support a 16 x 16
   switch with up to 948 Gbps in aggregate bandwidth, roughly matching the
   transceiver bandwidth on the latest FPGAs.}},

   fibers studied included hardwood high yield pulp, softwood high yield
   pulp, and bleached kraft softwood pulp fibers. Composite mechanical and
   thermal properties were characterized. The incorporation of pulp fibers
   significantly increased the composite storage moduli and elasticity,
   promoted the cold crystallization and recrystallization of PLA, and
   dramatically improved composite tensile moduli and strengths. The
   highest composite tensile strength achieved was 121 MPa, nearly one fold
   higher than that of the neat PLA. The overall fiber efficiency factors
   for composite tensile strengths derived from the micromechanics models
   were found to be much higher than that of conventional random short

Abstract = {{The interactions of K2CO3 with ash-free coal in N-2 or CO2 atmospheres
   were studied at 700 degrees C by thermogravimetry and in situ X-ray
   diffraction. Upon heating in a N-2 atmosphere, K2CO3 influenced the
   pyrolysis of the ash-free coal by reducing the temperature from 320 to
   240 degrees C at which the maximum rate of devolatilization occurred. At
   650 degrees C, the devolatilization of ash-free coal was finished.
   However, ash-free coal mixed with K2CO3 exhibited a further weight
   decrease due to the release of CO from the carbonate while heating in
   N-2 at 700 degrees C. In this step, the potassium catalyst was reduced
   to a -COK and/or -CK surface complex, which might be the active species
   in the catalytic gasification process. In situ X-ray diffraction
   analysis also suggested that K2CO3 does not exist in inert gas (N-2) and
   gasification (CO2) atmospheres at 700 degrees C. At this temperature,
   the evaporation of potassium is negligible. A faster CO2 gasification
   rate was achieved by holding the sample (ash-free coal mixed with K2CO3)
   for 150 min at 700 degrees C in N-2 prior to switching to the reaction
   gas, compared with no holding time. This result indicates that catalyst
   reduction is necessary for a fast char conversion and also shows that
   the reaction gas (i.e., CO2) itself inhibits the reduction process. (C)

Abstract = {{An integrated approach for the production of biorenewable hydrogen
   through catalytic steam reforming of the water-soluble products obtained
   from autocatalytic hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose is
   presented. Several feedstocks containing 5, 10 and 30 wt\% solid were
   hydrolyzed in a subcritical water medium at a temperature range of
   200-350 degrees C and residence times of 1-30 min without the addition
   of a mineral acid. The optimum operating temperature and residence time
   for the hydrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose were identified. The
   maximum hydrolysis yield slightly decreased by increasing the solid
   loading. After the removal of solid residue, the hydrolysis products
   were injected into a downdraft fixed bed catalytic reactor kept at 800
   degrees C and under atmospheric pressure to convert the biomass-derived
   organic mixture to syngas. A glucose solution, as a model compound of
   the hydrolysis product mixture, was used in the preliminary steam
   reforming experiments to evaluate the activity of different supported
   nickel catalysts. These experiments were conducted at a steam to carbon
   ratio (S/C) of 32, a weight hourly space velocity of 30
   (g(feed)/(g(catalyst) h)) and a supported nickel catalyst comprised of 5
   wt\% active metal. Several support materials were used in this study
   including MgO, alpha-Al2O3, hydrotalcite, H-ZSM5, YSZ, TiO2, and SiO2.
   The screening results indicated that MgO and alpha-Al2O3-supported
   nickel catalysts were highly active and both resulted in a carbon
   conversion of 92\%, and a hydrogen yield of 59 mmol/g(glucose). The
   steam reforming of cellulose and hemicellulose hydrolysis products over
   Ni/MgO resulted in 76\% and 55\% overall carbon conversions, and
   biomass-to-hydrogen yields of 50 and 31 mmol/g(feed), respectively. The
   same processing strategy can be applied for the conversion of other wet
   biomass feedstocks such as algae and activated sludge. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Yttria-stabilized zirconia (YSZ) electrolytes were deposited by
   suspension plasma spraying (SPS) and solution precursor plasma spraying
   (SPPS). The electrolytes were evaluated for permeability,
   microstructure, and electrochemical performance. With SPS, three
   different suspensions were tested to explore the influence of powder
   size distribution and liquid properties. Electrolytes made from
   suspensions of a powder with d(50) = 2.6 mu m were more gas-tight than
   those made from suspensions of a powder with d(50) = 0.6 mu m. A peak
   open circuit voltage of 1.00 V was measured at 750 degrees C with a cell
   with an electrolyte made from a suspension of d(50) = 2.6 mu m powder.
   The use of a flammable suspension liquid was beneficial for improving
   electrolyte conductivity when using lower energy plasmas, but the choice
   of liquid was less important when using higher energy plasmas. With
   SPPS, peak electrolyte conductivities were comparable to the peak
   conductivities of the SPS electrolytes. However, leak rates through the
   SPPS electrolytes were higher than those through the electrolytes made
   from suspensions of d(50) = 2.6 mu m powder. The electrochemical test
   data on SPPS electrolytes are the first reported in the literature. (C)

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF POWER SOURCES}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{822-829}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{It is increasingly recognized that a significant component of apparent
   self-discharge in supercapacitors is, in fact, due to charge
   redistribution. This charge redistribution is due to the limited
   mobility and hence high resistance of ions moving in the smallest pores
   of the carbon electrodes. A simple two-branch equivalent circuit has
   been used to model this charge redistribution and has been applied to an
   ultra-microporous aqueous electrochemical capacitor. The results
   indicate that a substantial fraction of the total capacitance is found
   in the smallest pores and that the resistance to ionic movement is four
   orders of magnitude higher than in the bulk electrolyte. A survey of the
   literature indicates that many commercial capacitors with organic
   electrolyte have similar electrical properties. These properties mean
   that a significant fraction of the overall pore surface and hence
   capacitance of the electrode is not accessible during time frames of
   practical interest and is therefore wasted. A mechanism for the low
   mobility of ions in micropores is proposed. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{This paper presents an analytical design method for the dc collector
   systems of offshore wind farms and proposes an improved topology to
   overcome the limitations of the conventional series-parallel (SP)
   topology. During a severe failure in the SP topology, bypassing the
   faulty units imposes overvoltage on fault-free units and leads to the
   disconnection of the series branch from the collector system. By
   providing auxiliary connection paths, the suggested topology reduces the
   overvoltage of the units and hence maintains fault-free units
   operational following a severe failure. Hence, the efficiency of a wind
   farm increases considerably upon any failure occurrence. To show the
   merits of the suggested topology, the captured power during a failure
   has been calculated and fairly compared with that of the conventional SP
   topology, considering the excess cost of the suggested topology due to
   additional connection paths. To investigate the performances of both
   topologies and their feasibility, a collector system including 12 wind
   turbine generators has been simulated in time domain software
   environment. Then, various failure scenarios have been investigated to
   evaluate the transient behavior of the dc collector system following
   slight and severe failures. The study results reveal the feasibility of
   the proposed topology as a promising structure for future dc collector
   systems.}},

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},

Month = {{DEC 28}},
Abstract = {{Ultraviolet photocarrier radiometry (UV-PCR) was used for the
   characterization of thin-film (nanolayer) intrinsic hydrogenated
   amorphous silicon (i-a-Si:H) on c-Si. The small absorption depth
   (approximately 10 nm at 355 nm laser excitation) leads to strong
   influence of the nanolayer parameters on the propagation and
   recombination of the photocarrier density wave (CDW) within the layer
   and the substrate. A theoretical PCR model including the presence of
   effective interface carrier traps was developed and used to evaluate the
   transport parameters of the substrate c-Si as well as those of the
   i-a-Si: H nanolayer. Unlike conventional optoelectronic characterization
   methods such as photoconductance, photovoltage, and photoluminescence,
   UV-PCR can be applied to more complete quantitative characterization of
   a-Si:H/c-Si heterojunction solar cells, including transport properties
   and defect structures. The quantitative results elucidate the strong
   effect of a front-surface passivating nanolayer on the transport
   properties of the entire structure as the result of effective
   a-Si:H/c-Si interface trap neutralization through occupation. A further
   dramatic improvement of those properties with the addition of a
   back-surface passivating nanolayer is observed and interpreted as the
   result of the interaction of the increased excess bulk CDW with, and
   more complete occupation and neutralization of, effective front
   interface traps. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Title = {{Hand contour detection in wearable camera video using an adaptive
   histogram region of interest}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 19}},
Abstract = {{Background: Monitoring hand function at home is needed to better
   evaluate the effectiveness of rehabilitation interventions. Our
   objective is to develop wearable computer vision systems for hand
   function monitoring. The specific aim of this study is to develop an
   algorithm that can identify hand contours in video from a wearable
   camera that records the user's point of view, without the need for
   markers.
   Methods: The two-step image processing approach for each frame consists
   of: (1) Detecting a hand in the image, and choosing one seed point that
   lies within the hand. This step is based on a priori models of skin
   colour. (2) Identifying the contour of the region containing the seed
   point. This is accomplished by adaptively determining, for each frame,
   the region within a colour histogram that corresponds to hand colours,
   and backprojecting the image using the reduced histogram.
   Results: In four test videos relevant to activities of daily living, the
   hand detector classification accuracy was 88.3\%. The contour detection
   results were compared to manually traced contours in 97 test frames, and
   the median F-score was 0.86.
   Conclusion: This algorithm will form the basis for a wearable
   computer-vision system that can monitor and log the interactions of the
   hand with its environment.}},

Abstract = {{Range-based localisation and tracking methods use the time-of-arrival
   (TOA) between the mobile station and several base stations, but the
   multipath propagation of non-line-of-sight channels complicates the
   estimation and processing. For channel modelling, the Gaussian scatterer
   distribution model has been reported to have a reasonable match between
   its TOA probability density distribution (PDF) and measured TOA data. In
   this study, this TOA PDF is adapted, along with selection from multiple
   motion models of the mobile station, for a new location and tracking
   algorithm. Since the TOA PDF is non-Gaussian and is a non-linear
   function of the position of the mobile, particle filtering is used which
   increases the complexity of the algorithm. The focus is on the tracking
   performance, and this is evaluated by simulation using idealised
   statistical channels, allowing direct comparison between different
   location algorithms. In this context, the presented algorithm is more
   accurate than the benchmarks of extended Kalman filter tracking, and
   positioning using least squares.}},

Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{745-756}},

Abstract = {{A previous approach to robust intensity-modulated radiation therapy
   (IMRT) treatment planning for moving tumors in the lung involves solving
   a single planning problem before the start of treatment and using the
   resulting solution in all of the subsequent treatment sessions. In this
   paper, we develop an adaptive robust optimization approach to IMRT
   treatment planning for lung cancer, where information gathered in prior
   treatment sessions is used to update the uncertainty set and guide the
   reoptimization of the treatment for the next session. Such an approach
   allows for the estimate of the uncertain effect to improve as the
   treatment goes on and represents a generalization of existing robust
   optimization and adaptive radiation therapy methodologies. Our method is
   computationally tractable, as it involves solving a sequence of linear
   optimization problems. We present computational results for a lung
   cancer patient case and show that using our adaptive robust method, it
   is possible to attain an improvement over the traditional robust
   approach in both tumor coverage and organ sparing simultaneously. We
   also prove that under certain conditions our adaptive robust method is
   asymptotically optimal, which provides insight into the performance
   observed in our computational study. The essence of our method - solving
   a sequence of single-stage robust optimization problems, with the
   uncertainty set updated each time - can potentially be applied to other
   problems that involve multi-stage decisions to be made under
   uncertainty. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Humanized monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against HER2 are being engineered
   to treat cancer. We utilized phage-display technology to generate a
   novel anti-HER2 mAb (named 73JIgG) that binds an epitope of HER2
   distinct from that of trastuzumab. Although these mAbs bind to the same
   cell surface receptor, they have different cell distribution profiles.
   After 3 h of incubation, almost 10\% of the total 73JIgG reaches the
   lysosome compared to less than 3\% of trastuzumab. Interestingly, 73JIgG
   disassociates from HER2 whereas trastuzumab remains bound to the
   receptor. Importantly, HER2 distribution is not affected by the antibody
   binding epitope, thus negating this mechanism as the reason for the
   difference in intracellular trafficking of 73JIgG versus trastuzumab.
   Each of trastuzumab and 73JIgG was chemically-modified with either a
   small molecule or polymeric nanoparticle to better understand the
   influence of conjugation on cellular localization. Relative to antibody
   alone, antibody-nanoparticle conjugates resulted in a higher
   concentration of antibodies in the lysosome whereas antibody-small
   molecule conjugates did not affect cell trafficking to the lysosome.
   Given the importance of lysosomal targeting, these results demonstrate
   the importance of understanding the influence of the antibody-conjugate
   on cell trafficking for ultimate optimization of treatment selection.

Abstract = {{Access to robust and information-rich human cardiac tissue models would
   accelerate drug-based strategies for treating heart disease. Despite
   significant effort, the generation of high-fidelity adult-like human
   cardiac tissue analogs remains challenging. We used computational
   modeling of tissue contraction and assembly mechanics in conjunction
   with microfabricated constraints to guide the design of aligned and
   functional 3D human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC)-derived cardiac
   microtissues that we term cardiac microwires (CMWs). Miniaturization of
   the platform circumvented the need for tissue vascularization and
   enabled higher-throughput image-based analysis of CMW drug
   responsiveness. CMW tissue properties could be tuned using
   electromechanical stimuli and cell composition. Specifically,
   controlling self-assembly of 3D tissues in aligned collagen, and pacing
   with point stimulation electrodes, were found to promote cardiac
   maturation-associated gene expression and in vivo-like electrical signal
   propagation. Furthermore, screening a range of hPSC-derived cardiac cell
   ratios identified that 75\% NKX2 Homeobox 5 (NKX2-5)+ cardiomyocytes and
   25\% Cluster of Differentiation 90 OR (CD90)+ nonmyocytes optimized
   tissue remodeling dynamics and yielded enhanced structural and
   functional properties. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the
   optimized platform in a tachycardic model of arrhythmogenesis, an aspect
   of cardiac electrophysiology not previously recapitulated in 3D in vitro
   hPSC-derived cardiac microtissue models. The design criteria identified
   with our CMW platform should accelerate the development of predictive in
   vitro assays of human heart tissue function.}},

Abstract = {{Previous attempts to model elevated-pressure coflow laminar flames have
   been hindered by neglecting the preheating within the burner, caused by
   downward heat transfer to the burner. In the present work, the
   computational domain is extended below the exit plane of the fuel tube
   to account for the flame preheating effect. Conjugate heat transfer
   (CHT) is implemented by the harmonic mean method to model the heat
   transfer between the fluid streams and solid fuel tube. This extension
   of the domain allows for solutions to a high pressure ethane/air data
   set from 2 to 33atm, which is an improvement over previous attempts
   where only pressures below 15atm could be modeled. The extended model
   more accurately predicts centerline soot formation than the truncated
   model due to capturing fuel pyrolysis that occurs below the exit plane
   of the fuel tube. This increased fuel pyrolysis increases the
   contribution by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) condensation to
   computed soot volume fractions. For pressures above 20atm, the extended
   model predicts that PAH condensation is the dominant mechanism on the
   wingsa location where surface growth was thought to be heavily dominant
   regardless of flame characteristics. It is determined that the choice of
   fuel tube wall treatment does significantly affect numerical
   predictions, with the best experimental agreement obtained using a CHT
   model as oppose to an isothermal or adiabatic walls. The extended model
   with CHT is the only model that displays quantitative accuracy and is a
   significant advancement over previous qualitatively accurate models.

Title = {{Surface shear stress and membrane fouling when considering natural water
   matrices}},
Journal = {{DESALINATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{330}},
Pages = {{22-27}},
Month = {{DEC 2}},
Abstract = {{The effect of surface shear stress on membrane fouling during submerged
   hollow fiber ultrafiltration of three different surface waters ( two
   lakes, one river) was investigated. Surface shear stresses that mimicked
   those induced when applying continuous and intermittent coarse bubble
   air sparging, large pulse bubble air sparging, as well as no air
   sparging were considered. The results suggest that fouling was mainly
   due to the accumulation of the biopolymer fraction of the natural
   organic matter present in the raw water. Inducing shear stresses onto
   the membrane surface significantly decreased the rate of membrane
   fouling (relative to no shear stress applied) in all waters tested. Of
   the shear stress conditions studied, that which mimicked large pulse
   bubble sparging had the greatest effect, reducing fouling by up to 80\%
   when compared to conditions with no sparging applied. Conditions that
   mimicked intermittent and continuous coarse bubble fouling reduced the
   rate of fouling by up to 77 and 49\%, respectively. These results
   suggest that the shear stresses induced by sparging can promote back
   transport of soluble organic material from the membrane surface. A
   semi-empirical relationship was developed to estimate the effect of raw
   water characteristics and applied sparging conditions on membrane
   fouling. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   the substrates were characterized by scanning electron microscopy. It
   was shown that the degree of coverage of the aluminum coatings increased
   with porosity of the substrate. In addition, increased reaction time and

Abstract = {{Optical coherence elastography (OCE) provides deformation or material
   properties, mapping of soft tissue. We aim to develop a robust speckle
   tracking OCE technique with improved resolution and accuracy. A digital
   image correlation (DIC)-based OCE technique was developed by combining
   an advanced DIC algorithm with optical coherence tomography (OCT).
   System calibration and measurement error evaluation demonstrated that
   this DIC-based OCE technique had a resolution of similar to 0.6 mu m
   displacement and <0.5\% strain measurement in the axial scan direction.
   The measured displacement ranged from 0.6 to 150 mu m, obtained via
   phantom imaging. The capability of the DIC-based OCE technique, for
   differentiation of stiffness, was evaluated by imaging a candle gel
   phantom with an irregularly shaped stiff inclusion. OCE imaging of a
   chicken breast sample differentiated the fat, membrane, and muscle
   layers. Strain elastograms of an aneurysm sample showed heterogeneity of
   the tissue and clear contrast between the adventitia and media. These
   promising results demonstrated the capability of the DIC-based OCE for
   the characterization of the various components of the tissue sample.
   Further improvement of the system will be conducted to make this OCE
   technique a practical tool for measuring and differentiating material
   properties of soft tissue. (C) The Authors. Published by SPIE under a

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The effectiveness of fiber-reinforced polymers (FRP) in structural
   upgrade has been demonstrated repeatedly in short-term laboratory tests
   and field applications. Consequently, the level of interest in exploring
   the potential applications of FRP in various types of structures and
   environments has increased. One of the potential areas of application of
   FRP is in nuclear power plants (NPP). However, there is very little
   research data available on the durability of FRP subject to an NPP
   environment. This paper reports the results from an experimental program
   aimed to address this knowledge gap. The study involved testing a total
   of 84 specimens consisting of FRP coupons, FRP-FRP single lap-bonded
   specimens, and FRP-bonded concrete prisms for their performance before
   and after exposure to gamma radiation. Both glass and carbon FRPs were
   included in this study. The specimens were tested for FRP tensile,
   FRP-to-FRP bond, and FRP-to-concrete bond properties. Results showed
   that the tensile and bond properties of FRP were not adversely affected
   in any significant manner as a result of the exposure. (C) 2013 American

   Deposition}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{26}},
Number = {{6}},

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Background: Predictable delivery of aerosol medication for a given
   patient and drug-device combination is crucial, both for therapeutic
   effect and to avoid toxicity. The gold standard for measuring pulmonary
   drug deposition (PDD) is gamma scintigraphy. However, these techniques
   expose patients to radiation, are complicated, and are relevant for only
   one patient and drug-device combination, making them less available.
   Alternatively, in vitro experiments have been used as a surrogate to
   estimate in vivo performance, but this is time-consuming and has few
   ``in vitro to in vivo'' correlations for therapeutics delivered by
   inhalation. An alternative method for determining inhaled mass and PDD
   is proposed by deriving and validating a mathematical model, for the
   individual breathing patterns of normal subjects and drug-device
   operating parameters. This model was evaluated for patients with cystic
   fibrosis (CF).
   Methods: This study is comprised of three stages: mathematical model
   derivation, in vitro testing, and in vivo validation. The model was
   derived from an idealized patient's respiration cycle and the
   steady-state operating characteristics of a drug-device combination. The
   model was tested under in vitro dynamic conditions that varied tidal
   volume, inspiration-to-expiration time, and breaths per minute. This
   approach was then extended to incorporate additional physiological
   parameters (dead space, aerodynamic particle size distribution) and
   validated against in vivo nuclear medicine data in predicting PDD in
   both normal subjects and those with CF.
   Results: The model shows strong agreement with in vitro testing. In vivo
   testing with normal subjects yielded good agreement, but less agreement
   for patients with chronic obstructive lung disease and bronchiectasis
   from CF.
   Conclusions: The mathematical model was successful in accommodating a
   wide range of breathing patterns and drug-device combinations.
   Furthermore, the model has demonstrated its effectiveness in predicting
   the amount of aerosol delivered to ``normal'' subjects. However,
   challenges remain in predicting deposition in obstructive lung disease.}},

Abstract = {{A CMOS tunable-wavelength multi-color photogate (CPG) sensor is
   presented. Sensing of a small set of well-separated wavelengths (e.g., >
   50 nm apart) is achieved by tuning the spectral response of the device
   with a bias voltage. The CPG employs the polysilicon gate as an optical
   filter, which eliminates the need for an external color filter. A
   prototype has been fabricated in a standard 0.35 mu m digital CMOS
   technology and demonstrates intensity measurements of blue (450 nm),
   green (520 nm), and red (620 nm) illumination with peak signal-to-noise
   ratios (SNRs) of 34.7 dB, 29.2 dB, and 34.8 dB, respectively. The
   prototype is applied to fluorescence detection of green-emitting quantum
   dots (gQDs) and red-emitting quantum dots (rQDs). It spectrally
   differentiates among multiple emission bands, effectively implementing
   on-chip emission filtering. The prototype demonstrates single-color
   measurements of gQD and rQD concentrations to a detection limit of 24
   nM, and multi-color measurements of solutions containing both colors of
   QDs to a detection limit of 90 nM and 120 nM of gQD and rQD,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we aim to identify the strategies that maximize and
   monotonically increase the density of coding opportunities in instantly
   decodable network coding (IDNC). Using the graph representation of IDNC,
   we first derive an expression for the exact evolution of the edge set
   size after the transmission of any arbitrary coded packet. From the
   derived expression, we show that sending commonly wanted packets for all
   the receivers can maximize the number of coding opportunities. Since
   guaranteeing such property in IDNC is usually impossible, this strategy
   does not guarantee the achievement of our target. Consequently, we
   further investigate the problem by deriving an expression for the
   expected edge set size evolution after ignoring the identities of the
   packets requested by the different receivers and considering only their
   numbers. This expression was then employed to show that serving the
   maximum number of receivers with largest numbers of missing packets and
   erasure probabilities tends to maximize and monotonically increase the
   expected density of coding opportunities. Simulation results justify our
   theoretical findings. Finally, we validate the importance of our work
   through two case studies showing that our strategy outperforms several
   well-known IDNC solutions in optimizing the IDNC completion delay and
   receiver goodput.}},

Abstract = {{This article describes the design and implementation of a novel
   compilation flow that implements circuits in FPGAs from a streaming
   programming language. The streaming language supported is called FPGA
   Brook and is based on the existing Brook language. It allows system
   designers to express applications in a way that exposes parallelism,
   which can be exploited through hardware implementation. FPGA Brook
   supports replication, allowing parts of an application to be implemented
   as multiple hardware units operating in parallel. Hardware units are
   interconnected through FIFO buffers which use the small memory modules
   available in FPGAs. The FPGA Brook automated design flow uses a
   source-to-source compiler, developed as a part of this work, and
   combines it with a commercial behavioral synthesis tool to generate the
   hardware implementation. A suite of benchmark applications was developed
   in FPGA Brook and implemented using our design flow. Experimental
   results indicate that performance of many applications scales well with
   replication. Our benchmark applications also achieve significantly
   better results than corresponding implementations using a commercial
   behavioral synthesis tool. We conclude that using an automated design
   flow for implementation of streaming applications in FPGAs is a
   promising methodology.}},

Abstract = {{Performance of base-isolated buildings subjected to near-fault ground
   motions containing long-period pulses is of increasing concern, because
   these ground motions have the potential to impose large seismic demands
   on structures. A review of previous studies on the performance
   evaluation of base-isolated reinforced concrete (RC) buildings under
   near-fault ground motions shows that these studies lack in the
   consideration of seismic pounding and the use of lower bound and upper
   bound values of isolator properties according to the current state of
   practice. Accordingly, in this study the performance of a typical
   four-story base-isolated RC building is evaluated using a
   three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model, considering bounding
   values of isolator properties, to investigate the influences of (i)
   pulse-like nature of near-fault ground motions and (ii) seismic pounding
   with retaining walls at the base. Two sets of ground motions containing
   14 far-fault non-pulse-like ground motions and 14 near-fault pulse-like
   ground motions, representing the risk-targeted maximum considered
   earthquake (MCER), are used. It is found that the response indicators of
   the building under near-fault motions are significantly larger than
   those under far-fault motions. Analysis results reveal that the building
   response indicators are significantly increased due to seismic pounding.
   Nonetheless, if a bounding analysis is conducted, consideration of
   seismic pounding in the analysis does not have appreciable consequences
   on the prediction of damage to structural elements and drift-sensitive
   nonstructural components, while dramatic increase in floor accelerations
   due to pounding is critical for acceleration-sensitive nonstructural
   components.}},

Abstract = {{The location of active users is an important factor in the performance
   analysis of mobile multicell networks, but it is difficult to quantify
   due to the wide variety of user mobility and session patterns. In this
   work, we study the stationary distribution of users by modeling the
   system as a multi-route queueing network with Poisson inputs. We
   consider arbitrary routing and arbitrary joint probability distributions
   for the channel holding times in each route. Through a
   decomposition-composition approach, we derive a closed-form expression
   for the joint stationary distribution for the number of users in all
   cells. The stationary user distribution (1) is insensitive to the user
   movement patterns, (2) is insensitive to general and dependently
   distributed channel holding times, (3) depends only on the average
   arrival rate and average channel holding time at each cell, and (4) is
   completely characterized by an open network with M/M/infinity queues. We
   use the Dartmouth trace to validate our analysis, which shows that the
   analytical model is accurate when new session arrivals are Poisson and
   remains useful when non-Poisson session arrivals are also included in
   the data set. Our results suggest that accurate calculation of the user
   distribution, and other associated metrics such as the system workload,
   can be achieved with much lower complexity than previously expected.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, 35 young, healthy adults were tested on whether
   speech-like stimuli evoke a unique response in the auditory efferent
   system. To this end, descending cortical influences on medial
   olivocochlear (MOC) activity were indirectly evaluated by studying the
   effects of contralateral suppression on distortion product otoacoustic
   emissions (DPOAEs) under four conditions: (a) in the absence of any
   contralateral noise (Baseline), (b) presence of contralateral broadband
   noise (Noise Baseline), (c) vowel discrimination-in-noise task (VDN) and
   (d) tone discrimination-in-noise (TDN) task. A statistically significant
   release from suppression was evident across all tested DPOAE frequencies
   (1, 1.5 and 2 kHz) only for the VDN task (p < 0: 05), which yielded
   greater release from suppression than the TDN task. These findings
   indicate that during active listening in the presence of noise, the MOC
   activity may be differentially modulated depending on the type of
   stimulus (vowel vs. tone). Specifically, in the presence of background
   noise, vowels may show a greater release from suppression in the cochlea
   than frequency, intensity and duration matched tones.}},

Abstract = {{The secondary phase transformations in a commercial super duplex
   stainless steel were investigated by micro-chemical analyses and high
   resolution scanning probe microscopy. Energy dispersive X-ray and
   electron probe detected ferrite and austenite as well as secondary
   phases in unetched aged duplex stainless steel type 25Cr-7Ni-3Mo. Volta
   potential indicated that nitride and sigma appeared more active than
   ferrite, while secondary austenite and austenite presented a nobler
   potential. Reversal order in nobility is thought to be attributable to
   the potential ranking provided by oxide nature diversity as a result of
   secondary phase surface compositions on steel. After eutectoid
   transformation, secondary austenite was detected by electron probe
   microanalysis, whereas atomic force microscopy distinguished this phase
   from former austenite by image contrast. Magnetic force microscopy
   revealed a ``ghosted{''} effect on the latter microstructure probably
   derived from metal memory reminiscence of mechanical polishing at
   passivity and long range magnetic forces of ferrite phase. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Wavelength-Modulated Differential Laser Photothermal Radiometry
   (WM-DPTR) has been designed for noninvasive glucose measurements in the
   mid-infrared (MIR) range. Glucose measurements in human blood serum in
   the physiological range (20-320 mg/dl) with predicted error <10.3 mg/dl
   demonstrated high sensitivity and accuracy to meet wide clinical
   detection requirements, ranging from hypoglycemia to hyperglycemia. The
   glucose sensitivity and specificity of WM-DPTR stem from the subtraction
   of the simultaneously measured signals from two excitation laser beams
   at wavelengths near the peak and the baseline of the strongest
   interference-free glucose absorption band in the MIR range. It was found
   that the serum glucose sensitivity and measurement precision strongly
   depend on the tunability and stability of the intensity ratio and the
   phase shift of the two laser beams. This level of accuracy was favorably
   compared to other MIR techniques. WM-DPTR has shown excellent potential
   to be developed into a clinically viable noninvasive glucose biosensor.

Abstract = {{Pipe transient signals are hyperbolic in nature where key features of
   the signal repeat periodically and are well suited to the analysis in
   the frequency domain. For this reason, a number of studies have been
   conducted on the use of frequency domain approaches for a variety of
   purposes, from fault detection to the prediction of the unsteady system
   response. Despite the number of papers on the topic over the past
   decades, there are no detailed review of the developments in the
   frequency domain analysis of pipe transient signals. This paper provides
   an assessment and review of the relevant research and provides a
   critical discussion of both the strengths and weaknesses of this
   approach. A method for extracting a system's frequency response function
   using conventional valve closure signals is proposed and the influence
   of various faults, friction and pipe wall viscoelasticity on this
   response function are compared with the corresponding impacts in the
   time domain. This study shows that most changes on the transient trace
   in time manifest as changes to the resonant responses in the frequency
   domain and the resonant responses encapsulate the essence of the system
   behaviour.}},

Abstract = {{Reduction of a mixed iron nickel oxide by hydrogen to produce
   ferronickel alloy was investigated by thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA).
   The iron nickel oxide, which contains 50 wt\% Fe and 10 wt\% Ni mainly
   in the form of hematite (Fe2O3) and nickel ferrite (NiFe2O4), is a
   residue produced from the water leaching of a selectively sulfation
   roasted nickel calcine. Continuous heating tests with a fixed heating
   rate as well as isothermal tests were performed. Results indicate that
   the reduction of the mixed oxide began above 350 degrees C. The
   reduction reactions occurred in a non-topochemical mode at low
   temperatures between 350 degrees C and 600 degrees C with its rate
   controlled by the solid-gas chemical reactions. The reduction rate
   increased with the increase in temperature from 350 degrees C up to 1100
   degrees C. Between 600 degrees C and 1200 degrees C, the rate
   controlling step was the diffusion of reducing gas through the pores of
   the sample bed with an apparent activation energy of 34.1 kJ/mol. Due to
   the melting of the silicate material at 1200 degrees C which
   substantially reduced the sample porosity, the reduction rate decreased.
   Above 1200 degrees C, the reduction rate increased again due to the
   increased diffusion of the reducing gas through the molten sample at
   higher temperatures. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The ability to control the solid-state structure of organic electronic
   materials can have a large effect on the quality of the devices to which
   they are applied. In this paper, we describe the use of pi-pi
   interactions to direct the crystal structure/solid-state arrangement of
   boron subphthalocyanine (BsubPc) derivatives by taking advantage of the
   pi-electron-deficiency (pi-acidity) of the BsubPc molecular fragment.
   First, we outline why BsubPc is a pi-acid by looking at its chemical
   characteristics and the structure of crystals formed with other
   pi-acidic moieties. Then we show how the solid-state arrangement of
   BsubPc can be purposefully altered by adding pi-basic substituents. We
   found that adding a naphthoxy substituent provides an interaction that
   is strong enough to direct BsubPc into a novel solid-state arrangement
   made up of ribbons (or catemers) of molecules linked through pi-stacking
   interactions between the naphthoxy and neighboring BsubPc molecular
   fragments. A similar effect was also seen when the naphthoxy fragment
   was added to the stronger pi-acid perfluoro-BsubPc (F(12)BsubPc).}},

Title = {{Age-related Differences in Tongue-Palate Pressures for Strength and

Abstract = {{The tongue plays a key role in the generation of pressures for
   transporting liquids and foods through the mouth in swallowing. Recent
   studies suggest that there is an age-related decline in tongue strength
   in healthy adults. However, whether age-related changes occur in tongue
   pressures generated for the purpose of swallowing remains unclear. Prior
   literature in this regard does not clearly explore the influence of task
   on apparent age-related differences in tongue pressure amplitudes.
   Furthermore, differences attributable to variations across individuals
   in strength, independent of age, have not clearly been elucidated. In
   this study, our goal was to clarify whether older adults have reduced
   tongue-palate pressures during maximum isometric, saliva swallowing, and
   water swallowing tasks, while controlling for individual variations in
   strength. Data were collected from 40 healthy younger adults (under age
   40) and 38 healthy mature adults (over age 60). As a group, the mature
   participants had significantly lower maximum isometric pressures (MIPs).
   Swallowing pressures differed significantly by task, with higher
   pressures seen in saliva swallows than in water swallows. Age-group
   differences were not seen in swallowing pressures. Consideration of MIP
   as a covariate in the analysis of swallowing pressures revealed
   significant correlations between strength and swallowing pressures in
   the older participant group. Age-group differences were evident only
   when strength was considered in the model, suggesting that apparent
   age-related differences are, in fact, explained by differences in
   strength, which tends to be lower in healthy older adults. Our results
   show no evidence of independent differences in swallowing pressures
   attributable to age.}},

   the time-domain electric and magnetic fields in terms of orthogonal

   technique is validated by modeling several microstrip circuits with
   uncertain physical dimensions and geometry. The computed -parameters are

Abstract = {{An intimate relation is established between non-Foster reactive elements
   and loss-compensated negative-group-delay (NGD) networks. It is shown
   that any possible network configuration containing a class of non-Foster
   elements operates as an NGD network. Likewise, it is demonstrated that a
   loss-compensated NGD network represents a reactive network with a
   non-Foster behavior. Consequently, these two properties can be
   intimately linked together and NGD networks can be utilized to implement
   non-Foster elements, such as negative capacitors and inductors. This
   result introduces another perspective in realizing non-Foster reactive
   elements, leading to new designs that are well behaved and more
   predictable in terms of stability and operation than traditional designs
   using negative impedance inverters and negative impedance converters.
   Based on this concept, loss-compensated NGD networks are proposed for
   realizing high-quality non-Foster reactive elements. Furthermore,
   entirely passive non-Foster elements with a limited quality (Q) factor
   are proposed for which the minimum Q factor and the maximum achievable
   bandwidth are inversely related. It is shown that the design of
   non-Foster reactive elements using NGD networks can lead to the
   realization of standalone unilateral non-Foster reactive elements in a
   certain bandwidth. Examples of such non-Foster reactive elements and
   networks are demonstrated experimentally and shown to be stable.}},

   trichloroethylene (TCE). However, target delivery of iron nanoparticles
   to DNAPL zones in the aquifer remains an elusive feature for NZVI
   technologies. This work discusses three strategies to deliver iron
   nanoparticles to DNAPL zones. To this end, iron oxide nanoparticles
   coated with oleate (OL) ions were used as stable analogs for NZVI. The
   OL-coated iron oxide nanoparticles are rendered lipophilic via (a) the
   addition of CaCl2, (b) acidification, or (c) the addition of a cationic
   surfactant, benzethonium chloride (BC). Mixtures of OL and BC show
   promise as a target delivery strategy due to the high stability of the
   nanoparticles in water, and their preferential partition into TCE in
   batch experiments. Column tests show that while the OL-BC coated iron
   oxide nanoparticles remain largely mobile in TCE-free columns, a large
   fraction of these particles are retained in TCE-contaminated columns,
   confirming the effectiveness of this target delivery strategy. (C) 2013

Title = {{An evaluation of Sherwood-Gilland models for NAPL dissolution and their

Abstract = {{Predicting the longevity of non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) source zones
   has proven to be a difficult modeling problem that has yet to be
   resolved. Research efforts towards understanding NAPL depletion have
   focused on developing empirical models that relate lumped mass transfer
   rates to velocities and organic saturations. These empirical models are
   often unable to predict NAPL dissolution for systems different from
   those used to calibrate them, indicating that system-specific factors
   important for dissolution are not considered. This introduces the need
   for a calibration step before these models can be reliably used to
   predict NAPL dissolution for systems of arbitrary characteristics.
   In this paper, five published Sherwood-Gilland models are evaluated
   using experimental observations from the dissolution of two
   laboratory-scale complex three-dimensional NAPL source zones. It is
   shown that the relative behavior of the five models depends on the
   system and source zone characteristics. Through a theoretical analysis,
   comparing Sherwood-Gilland type models to a process-based, thermodynamic
   dissolution model, it is shown that the coefficients of the
   Sherwood-Gilland models can be related to measurable soil properties.
   The derived dissolution model with soil-dependent coefficients predicts
   concentrations identical to those predicted by the thermodynamic
   dissolution model for cases with negligible hysteresis. This
   correspondence breaks down when hysteresis has a significant impact on
   interfacial areas. In such cases, the derived dissolution model will
   slightly underestimate dissolved concentrations at later times, but is
   more likely to capture system-specific dissolution rates than
   Sherwood-Gilland models. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This article investigates the behavior of the cognitive queueing system

   constraint. The queueing model is investigated under two cognitive
   transmit modes. A variable transmit rate that is equal to the cognitive
   channel's capacity is first revisited, then the case of constant
   transmit rate is considered. Both transmit modes are found to lead to an
   queueing model. The performance measures of the cognitive queue under
   these two modes are investigated and numerically compared. The
   performance measures include the mean transmit rate, mean service time,
   server utilization, mean waiting and transit times of the packets in the
   queue, mean number of waiting and transit packets in the queue, mean
   duration of the server's busy period, and mean number of packets served
   during the server's busy period. The effects of changing the primary
   outage probability constraint and the primary transmit rate on the
   performance measures are investigated as well.}},

Abstract = {{It has been demonstrated that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell
   (BM-MSCs) transplantation has beneficial effects on several central
   nervous system (CNS) debilitating conditions. Growing evidence indicate
   that trophic factors secreted by these cells are the key mechanism by
   which they are acting. These cells are frequently used in combination
   with 3D artificial matrices, for instance hydrogels, in tissue
   engineering-based approaches. However, so far, no study has been
   reported on the influence of such matrices, namely the presence or
   absence of extracellular matrix motifs, on BM-MSCs secretome and its
   effects in neuronal cell populations. In this sense, we herein studied
   the impact of a hydrogel, gellan gum, on the behavior and secretome of
   BM-MSCs, both in its commercial available form (commonly used in tissue
   engineering) and in a fibronectin peptide-modified form. The results
   showed that in the presence of a peptide in the gellan gum hydrogel,
   BM-MSCs presented higher proliferation and metabolic activity than in
   the regular hydrogel. Moreover, the typical spindle shape morphology of
   BM-MSCs was only observed in the modified hydrogel. The effects of the
   secretome of BM-MSCs were also affected by the chemical nature of the
   extracellular matrix. BM-MSCs cultured in the modified hydrogel were
   able to secrete factors that induced higher metabolic viabilities and
   neuronal cell densities, when compared to those of the unmodified
   hydrogel. Thus adding a peptide sequence to the gellan gum had a
   significant effect on the morphology, activity, proliferation and
   secretome of BM-MSCs. These results highlight the importance of
   mimicking the extracellular matrix when BM-MSCs are cultured in
   hydrogels for CNS applications. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Masson

Title = {{Decomposition Methods for Large Scale LP Decoding}},
Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY}},

Abstract = {{When binary linear error-correcting codes are used over symmetric
   channels, a relaxed version of the maximum likelihood decoding problem
   can be stated as a linear program (LP). This LP decoder can be used to
   decode error-correcting codes at bit-error-rates comparable to
   state-of-the-art belief propagation (BP) decoders, but with
   significantly stronger theoretical guarantees. However, LP decoding when
   implemented with standard LP solvers does not easily scale to the block
   lengths of modern error correcting codes. In this paper, we draw on
   decomposition methods from optimization theory, specifically the
   alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), to develop efficient
   distributed algorithms for LP decoding. The key enabling technical
   result is a ``two-slice{''} characterization of the parity polytope, the
   polytope formed by taking the convex hull of all codewords of the single
   parity check code. This new characterization simplifies the
   representation of points in the polytope. Using this simplification, we
   develop an efficient algorithm for Euclidean norm projection onto the
   parity polytope. This projection is required by the ADMM decoder and its
   solution allows us to use LP decoding, with all its theoretical
   guarantees, to decode large-scale error correcting codes efficiently. We
   present numerical results for LDPC codes of lengths more than 1000. The
   waterfall region of LP decoding is seen to initiate at a slightly higher
   SNR than for sum-product BP, however an error floor is not observed for
   LP decoding, which is not the case for BP. Our implementation of LP
   decoding using the ADMM executes as fast as our baseline sum-product BP
   decoder, is fully parallelizable, and can be seen to implement a type of
   message-passing with a particularly simple schedule.}},

Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEAT AND MASS TRANSFER}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{67}},
Pages = {{974-983}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The influence of solid particles on the heat transfer rate of a
   non-isothermal turbulent channel flow is studied using large-eddy
   simulation. An Eulerian-Lagrangian approach is adopted, and the backward
   effects of particles in both the momentum and energy equations are taken
   into account. It is shown that at a constant particle mass loading, the
   heat transfer rate increases proportionally with the particle specific
   heat. For a constant particle specific heat, however, depending on the
   value of the particle specific heat, the heat transfer rate may
   decrease, increase, or stay unchanged with the increase of the mass
   loading. To further clarify this issue, the total Nusselt number is
   split into a turbulence contribution and a particles contribution, and
   the relation of the Nusselt number with the fluid temperature velocity
   correlation and the fluid-particles heat transfer is examined in
   details. In addition, the mean and fluctuating profiles for fluid and
   particles are reported, and the results are validated against the
   available data in the literature. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Predicting objective function weights from patient anatomy in prostate
   IMRT treatment planning}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning
   typically combines multiple criteria into a single objective function by
   taking a weighted sum. The authors propose a statistical model that
   predicts objective function weights from patient anatomy for prostate
   IMRT treatment planning. This study provides a proof of concept for
   geometry-driven weight determination.
   Methods: A previously developed inverse optimization method (IOM) was
   used to generate optimal objective function weights for 24 patients
   using their historical treatment plans (i.e., dose distributions). These
   IOM weights were around 1\% for each of the femoral heads, while bladder
   and rectum weights varied greatly between patients. A regression model
   was developed to predict a patient's rectum weight using the ratio of
   the overlap volume of the rectum and bladder with the planning target
   volume at a 1 cm expansion as the independent variable. The femoral head
   weights were fixed to 1\% each and the bladder weight was calculated as
   one minus the rectum and femoral head weights. The model was validated
   using leave-one-out cross validation. Objective values and dose
   distributions generated through inverse planning using the predicted
   weights were compared to those generated using the original IOM weights,
   as well as an average of the IOM weights across all patients.
   Results: The IOM weight vectors were on average six times closer to the
   predicted weight vectors than to the average weight vector, using l(2)
   distance. Likewise, the bladder and rectum objective values achieved by
   the predicted weights were more similar to the objective values achieved
   by the IOM weights. The difference in objective value performance
   between the predicted and average weights was statistically significant
   according to a one-sided sign test. For all patients, the difference in
   rectum V54.3 Gy, rectum V70.0 Gy, bladder V54.3 Gy, and bladder V70.0 Gy
   values between the dose distributions generated by the predicted weights
   and IOM weights was less than 5 percentage points. Similarly, the
   difference in femoral head V54.3 Gy values between the two dose
   distributions was less than 5 percentage points for all but one patient.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrates a proof of concept that patient
   anatomy can be used to predict appropriate objective function weights
   for treatment planning. In the long term, such geometry-driven weights
   may serve as a starting point for iterative treatment plan design or may
   provide information about the most clinically relevant region of the
   Pareto surface to explore. (C) 2013 American Association of Physicists

Abstract = {{Populations of cells create local environments that lead to emergent
   heterogeneity. This is particularly evident with human pluripotent stem
   cells (hPSCs): microenvironmental heterogeneity limits hPSC cell fate
   control. We developed a high-throughput platform to screen hPSCs in
   configurable microenvironments in which we optimized colony size, cell
   density and other parameters to achieve rapid and robust cell fate
   responses to exogenous cues. We used this platform to perform
   single-cell protein expression profiling, revealing that Oct4 and Sox2
   costaining discriminates pluripotent, neuroectoderm, primitive streak
   and extraembryonic cell fates. We applied this Oct4-Sox2 code to analyze
   dose responses of 27 developmental factors to obtain lineage-specific
   concentration optima and to quantify cell line-specific endogenous
   signaling pathway activation and differentiation bias. We demonstrated
   that short-term responses predict definitive endoderm induction
   efficiency and can be used to rescue differentiation of cell lines
   reticent to cardiac induction. This platform will facilitate
   high-throughput hPSC-based screening and quantification of
   lineage-induction bias.}},

Abstract = {{Profound changes of the vasculature in tumors critically impact drug
   delivery and therapy response. We aimed at developing a procedure to
   monitor morphological and functional parameters of the vasculature in
   subcutaneous xenograft models commonly applied for therapy testing by
   using probe-based confocal laser endomicroscopy.
   By monitoring various normal and diseased tissues, we established an
   experimental and analytical set-up to systematically analyze tracer
   extravasation from the microvasculature. Application of the approach in
   two xenograft models (HCT-116 and SW620) was realized consecutively
   throughout tumor growth.
   The incidence of dilated vessels increased with xenograft size in both
   models while macromolecule extravasation and tracer accumulation in the
   tumor tissue, respectively, was significantly reduced throughout growth.
   The development of dilated/ultradilated vessels correlated with tracer
   extravasation only in the HCT-116 but not the SW620 model. The
   underlying mechanisms are still ambiguous and discussed.
   Our findings clearly indicate that both xenograft type and size matter

Abstract = {{We consider amplify-and-forward multi-antenna relaying between a single
   pair of source and destination under relay per-antenna power
   constraints. We design the optimal relay processing matrix to minimize
   the maximum per-antenna power budget for a received SNR target. With
   given transmit and receive beamformers at the source and destination,
   respectively, we first focus on the equivalent system with
   single-antenna source and destination. Although non-convex, we show that
   the optimization satisfies strong Lagrange duality and can be solved in
   the Lagrangian dual domain. We reveal a prominent structure of this
   problem, by establishing its duality with direct SIMO beamforming system
   with an uncertain noise. This enables us to derive a semi-closed form
   expression for the optimal relay processing matrix that depends on a set
   of dual variables, which can be determined through numerical
   optimization with a significantly reduced problem space. We further show
   that the dual problem has a semi-definite programming form, which
   enables efficient numerical optimization methods to determine the dual
   variables with polynomial complexity. Using this result, the reverse
   problem of SNR maximization under a set of relay per-antenna power
   constraints is then addressed. We then consider the maximum relay
   beamforming achievable rate under different combinations of antenna
   setups at source and destination. In particular, we generalize the
   duality to MIMO relay beamforming vs. direct MIMO beamforming, and
   establish the dual relation of the two systems for different
   multi-antenna setups at source and destination.}},

Abstract = {{Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels in the vasculature, is
   a major research topic in biology with implications in development,
   cancer, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Although much
   knowledge has been acquired over many decades through application of
   various angiogenesis assays, these methods have various drawbacks that
   limit their overall utility. Given the importance of angiogenesis in our
   understanding of numerous biological processes and its potential as a
   therapeutic target in cancer and other diseases, there is need to
   develop useful tools with improved physiological relevance,
   accessibility, robustness, and throughput over existing assays. Recent
   developments in microfluidics have demonstrated enormous potential of
   microscale cell culture systems for biology studies, especially
   angiogenesis. This area is advancing rapidly, and it is important to
   remain up to date with the state of the art in technology and evaluate
   its current and future impact on angiogenesis research. This review
   examines the latest advances in microfluidic angiogenesis systems.
   Design and methodology of microscale systems are discussed, and
   biological insights obtained from the systems are examined. Importantly,
   physiological relevance, accessibility, and data output of microfluidic
   angiogenesis systems are compared with traditional angiogenesis assays,
   and next challenges facing researchers are presented with consideration
   of the potential integration of automated systems.}},

Abstract = {{Efficacy of microwave energy for the extraction of xylan from birch wood
   as an alternative to conventional method of extraction was investigated.
   Effect of irradiation time and microwave power input on the
   solubilization of wood and yield of extracted xylan was studied. The
   maximum yield of xylan obtained at the higher power level was
   significantly lesser compared to the lower power level indicating the
   molecular degradation of the polymer. The highest yield of xylan (60 \%
   of the original xylan) was obtained at the lowest power level studied,
   110 W, for an irradiation time of 10 min. Comparison with conventional
   extraction showed that 10 min of microwave extraction provided a similar
   wood dissolution to that at 90 A degrees C for 1.5 h, but with a higher
   yield of xylan. Characterization of the precipitated xylan indicated
   that the extracted xylan contained 68-88 \% of xylose with the major
   chemical structure consisting of a linear backbone of (1-4)
   beta-d-xylopyransoyl residues. Molecular mass of the extracted xylan
   indicated that the xylan extracted using microwave contained 60-70 \% of
   high molecular weight fraction, and about 30-40 \% of low molecular
   weight fraction, whereas xylan extracted using conventional method
   showed a reverse trend. Molecular mass of non-aggregated xylan was
   reported to be 6,000 Da (in terms of dextran equivalents). Crystallinity
   of wood fibers increased irrespective of the method of extraction
   indicating no degradation of the strength of the fibers occurred during
   the extraction.}},

Abstract = {{This work uses an in situ filter test method to measure the
   size-resolved removal efficiency of indoor-generated ultrafine particles
   (approximately 7-100nm) for six new commercially available filters
   installed in a recirculating heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning
   (HVAC) system in an unoccupied test house. The fibrous HVAC filters were
   previously rated by the manufacturers according to ASHRAE Standard 52.2
   and ranged from shallow (2.5cm) fiberglass panel filters (MERV 4) to
   deep-bed (12.7cm) electrostatically charged synthetic media filters
   (MERV 16). Measured removal efficiency ranged from 0 to 10\% for most
   ultrafine particles (UFP) sizes with the lowest rated filters (MERV 4
   and 6) to 60-80\% for most UFP sizes with the highest rated filter (MERV
   16). The deeper bed filters generally achieved higher removal
   efficiencies than the panel filters, while maintaining a low pressure
   drop and higher airflow rate in the operating HVAC system. Assuming
   constant efficiency, a modeling effort using these measured values for
   new filters and other inputs from real buildings shows that MERV 13-16
   filters could reduce the indoor proportion of outdoor UFPs (in the
   absence of indoor sources) by as much as a factor of 2-3 in a typical
   single-family residence relative to the lowest efficiency filters,
   depending in part on particle size.}},

Abstract = {{Trip assignment is still a modelling and prediction challenge. For
   aggregate analyses, it may suffice to use traditional trip assignment
   approaches. However, investigations of drivers' choices with respect to
   network infrastructure changes require disaggregate and behavioural
   approaches. It is often crucial to investigate the effects of critical
   infrastructure elements in the network on drivers' route choice
   behaviour. The case of Montreal is of particular interest because the
   city, an island, is completely separated from the rest of the region by
   two important rivers. Consequently, drivers have to select one of the
   available bridges to reach their destination. A large-scale travel
   survey conducted in Montreal in 2008 is used for empirical
   investigations. It is a one-day trip diary of approximately 4\% of the
   city's population and includes the bridge chosen in the itinerary for
   car driver trips. An advanced discrete choice model that jointly models
   choice set formation and final choice is then formulated and estimated
   using the observed trips. The empirical model correctly identifies the
   effects of travel time interacting with time of day and destination trip
   purpose. Empirical results show that age, gender and household auto
   ownership explain the variation of scale parameters of route/bridge
   choice. A discussion of the model's performance is provided along with
   further result analysis and perspectives for further work. (c) 2013

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{As high-rise buildings are built taller and more slender, their dynamic
   behavior becomes an increasingly critical design consideration.
   Wind-induced vibrations cause an increase in the lateral wind design
   loads, but more importantly, they can be perceived by building
   occupants, creating levels of discomfort ranging from minor annoyance to
   severe motion sickness. The current techniques to address wind vibration
   perception include stiffening the lateral load-resisting system, adding
   mass to the building, reducing the number of stories, or incorporating a
   vibration absorber at the top of the building; each solution has
   significant economic consequences for builders. Significant distributed
   damage is also expected in tall buildings under severe seismic loading,
   as a result of the ductile seismic design philosophy that is widely used
   for such structures. In this paper, the viscoelastic coupling damper
   (VCD) that was developed at the University of Toronto to increase the
   level of inherent damping of tall coupled shear wall buildings to
   control wind-induced and earthquake-induced dynamic vibrations is
   introduced. Damping is provided by incorporating VCDs in lieu of
   coupling beams in common structural configurations and therefore does
   not occupy any valuable architectural space, while mitigating building
   tenant vibration perception problems and reducing both the wind and
   earthquake responses of the structure. This paper provides an overview
   of this newly proposed system, its development, and its performance
   benefits as well as the overall seismic and wind design philosophy that
   it encompasses. Two tall building case studies incorporating VCDs are
   presented to demonstrate how the system results in more efficient
   designs. In the examples that are presented, the focus is on the wind
   and moderate earthquake responses that often govern the design of such
   tall slender structures while reference is made to other studies where
   the response of the system under severe seismic loading conditions is
   examined in more detail and where results from tests conducted on the
   viscoelastic material and the VCDs in full-scale are presented.

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy (AFM) was employed to
   investigate the forces of interaction between aluminum silicates (mica
   and a synthetic aluminum-silicate) and iron particles, both bare and
   coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) polymer. Experiments were
   conducted in water and salt solutions (100 mM NaCl and 100 mM CaCl2) at
   pH 5.5, in water at pH 4 and 8, and in 10 mg/l humic acid solutions. In
   addition, humic acid sorption onto the synthetic aluminum-silicate was
   probed with a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring
   (QCM-D). Interactions between bare iron particles and aluminum silicate
   were attractive except at pH 8 and in the presence of humic acids in
   which case forces upon approach were repulsive. Interactions between
   bare iron and mica were similar, except that repulsive forces upon
   approach were measured in 100 mM NaCl solutions, possibly due to
   increased hydration of mica compared to aluminum silicate. Interactions
   between CMC coated iron particles and aluminum-silicates were either
   repulsive or at most weakly attractive, likely due to repulsive
   electro-steric forces associated with the CMC. QCM-D results indicated
   that humic acids adsorbed to aluminum silicate, producing electro-steric
   repulsion to coated and uncoated iron. AFM data were successfully
   modeled using extended DLVO theory and a modified Ohshima's model. This
   modeling provided insights into the contributions of various processes
   to the measured interaction forces, highlighting the importance of van
   der Waals and hydration forces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

   demonstrates viability. Controlled experiments, first with a human
   analogue and, subsequently, with a real human, illustrate the workings
   of the proposed framework. A tangible increase in action-recognition
   success rate over other strategies, particularly those with static
   cameras, is noteworthy. The proposed framework is also shown to operate
   in real-time. Further experiments examine the effect of scaling the
   number of obstacles and cameras, sensing-system mobility, and library
   actions on real-time performance.}},

Abstract = {{Composite Ni-Y0.15Zr0.85O1.925 anodes were fabricated by axial-injection
   suspension plasma spraying in open atmosphere conditions. The
   composition of the anode is controllable by adjustment of the plasma gas
   composition, stand-off distance, and suspension feed rate. The total
   porosity is controllable through the addition of carbon black to the
   suspension as a sacrificial pore-forming material as well as by
   adjustment of the suspension feed rate. The size of the NiO particles in
   suspension affects both the composition and total porosity, with larger
   NiO particles leading to increased Ni content and porosity in the
   deposited coatings. The surface roughness increases with a decrease of
   the in-flight droplet momentum, which results from both smaller NiO
   particles in suspension and the addition of low density pore-forming
   materials. A solid oxide fuel cell was fabricated with both electrodes
   and electrolyte fabricated by axial-injection plasma spraying. Peak
   power densities of 0.718 W cm(-2) and 1.13 W cm(-2) at 750 degrees C and

Abstract = {{The effect of process variables on the microstructure and properties of
   transient liquid phase (TLP) bonded IN-738LC superalloy was investigated
   using AMS 4776 filler metal. Continuous centerline eutectic phases,
   characterized as nickel-rich and chromium-rich borides, were observed at
   the joints with incomplete isothermal solidification. The eutectic width
   decreased with the increase of holding time and the increase in initial
   gap size resulted in thicker eutectic width in the samples bonded at the
   same temperature and for equivalent holding times. In contrast to the
   conventional expectation of the increase in the rate of isothermal
   solidification with the increase of temperature, rate decrease was
   observed with the increase of temperature to 1150 degrees C. The
   investigations demonstrated that low isothermal solidification rate was
   not only due to the enrichment of liquid phase with the base alloying
   elements such as Ti but also because of the reduction of solid
   solubility limit of B in the base metal contributed to the reduction of
   isothermal solidification rate. Microhardness and shear strength tests
   were carried out in order to investigate mechanical properties of the
   bonded samples. In the bonding condition in which isothermal
   solidification did not completely occur, eutectic constituent with the
   highest hardness in the bond region was the preferential failure source.
   The results showed that homogenized joints had the highest shear
   strength. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   Off-line digital time-domain simulation studies, in the EMTDC/PSCAD

   Chronic Stroke}},
Journal = {{PHYSIOTHERAPY CANADA}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{65}},

Pages = {{20-28}},
Month = {{WIN}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Motivated by a prior successful randomized controlled trial
   showing that functional electrical stimulation (FES) therapy can restore
   voluntary arm and hand function in people with severe stroke, this study
   was designed to examine neuromuscular changes in the upper limb
   following intensive FES therapy, consisting of task-specific upper-limb
   movements with a combination of preprogrammed FES and manual assisted
   motion. Methods: The patient was a 22-year-old woman who had suffered a
   haemorrhagic stroke 2 years earlier. FES therapy was administered for 1
   hour twice daily for 12 weeks, for a total of 108 treatment sessions.
   Results: While maximal voluntary contraction level of the upper-limb
   muscles did not show significant improvement, the ability to initiate
   and stop the muscle contraction voluntarily was regained in several
   upper-limb muscles (approx. 5\%-15\% of the maximum voluntary
   contraction of the same muscle in the less-affected arm). A reduction in
   arm spasticity was also observed, as indicated by the reduction of
   H-reflex in the wrist flexor muscle (82.1\% to 45.0\% in H-max/M-max)
   and decreased Modified Ashworth Scale scores (from 3 to 2 for the hand
   and 4 to 3 for the arm). Coordination between shoulder and elbow joints
   during the circle-drawing test improved considerably over the course of
   FES therapy: the patient was unable to draw a circle at all at baseline
   but was able to do so proficiently at discharge. Conclusion:
   Improvements in upper-limb function observed in people with severe
   stroke following intensive FES therapy can be attributed to (a) regained
   ability to voluntarily contract muscles of the affected arm, (b) reduced
   spasticity and improved muscle tone in the same muscles, and (c)
   increased range of motion of all joints.}},

Title = {{Tracking the cellulolytic activity of Clostridium thermocellum biofilms}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV 29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Microbial cellulose conversion by Clostridium thermocellum
   27405 occurs predominantly through the activity of substrate-adherent
   bacteria organized in thin, primarily single cell-layered biofilms. The
   importance of cellulosic surface exposure to microbial hydrolysis has
   received little attention despite its implied impact on conversion
   kinetics.
   Results: We showed the spatial heterogeneity of fiber distribution in
   pure cellulosic sheets, which made direct measurements of biofilm
   colonization and surface penetration impossible. Therefore, we utilized
   on-line measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) production in
   continuous-flow reactors, in conjunction with confocal imaging, to
   observe patterns of biofilm invasion and to indirectly estimate
   microbial accessibility to the substrate's surface and the resulting
   limitations on conversion kinetics. A strong positive correlation was
   found between cellulose consumption and CO2 production (R-2 = 0.996) and
   between surface area and maximum biofilm activity (R-2 = 0.981). We
   observed an initial biofilm development rate (0.46 h(-1), 0.34 h(-1) and
   0.33 h(-1)) on Whatman sheets (\#1, \#598 and \#3, respectively) that
   stabilized when the accessible surface was maximally colonized. The
   results suggest that cellulose conversion kinetics is initially subject
   to a microbial limitation period where the substrate is in excess,
   followed by a substrate limitation period where cellular mass, in the
   form of biofilms, is not limiting. Accessible surface area acts as an
   important determinant of the respective lengths of these two distinct
   periods. At end-point fermentation, all sheets were digested
   predominantly under substrate accessibility limitations (e. g., up to
   81\% of total CO2 production for Whatman \#1). Integration of CO2
   production rates over time showed Whatman \#3 underwent the fastest
   conversion efficiency under microbial limitation, suggestive of best
   biofilm penetration, while Whatman \#1 exhibited the least recalcitrance
   and the faster degradation during the substrate limitation period.
   Conclusion: The results showed that the specific biofilm development
   rate of cellulolytic bacteria such as C. thermocellum has a notable
   effect on overall reactor kinetics during the period of microbial
   limitation, when ca. 20\% of cellulose conversion occurs. The study
   further demonstrated the utility of on-line CO2 measurements as a method
   to assess biofilm development and substrate digestibility pertaining to
   microbial solubilization of cellulose, which is relevant when
   considering feedstock pre-treatment options.}},

Abstract = {{Stroke is a leading cause of disability with no effective regenerative
   treatment. One promising strategy for achieving tissue repair involves
   the stimulation of endogenous neural stem/progenitor cells through
   sequential delivery of epidermal growth factor (EGF) followed by
   erythropoietin (EPO). Yet currently available delivery strategies such
   as intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion cause significant tissue
   damage. We designed a novel delivery system that circumvents the blood
   brain barrier and directly releases growth factors to the brain.
   Sequential release of the two growth factors is a key in eliciting
   tissue repair. To control release, we encapsulate pegylated EGF
   (EGF-PEG) in poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles and EPO
   in biphasic microparticles comprised of a PLGA core and a poly(sebacic
   acid) coating. EGF-PEG and EPO polymeric particles are dispersed in a
   hyaluronan methylcellulose (HAMC) hydrogel which spatially confines the
   particles and attenuates the inflammatory response of brain tissue. Our
   composite-mediated, sequential delivery of EGF-PEG and EPO leads to
   tissue repair in a mouse stroke model and minimizes damage compared to
   ICV infusion. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Visible light photocatalysts based on doped crystalline forms of
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) have attracted significant scientific attention
   in recent decades. Amorphous TiO2, despite many merits over crystalline
   phases, has not been studied as thoroughly. In this paper, an in-depth
   analysis of the electronic properties of doped amorphous TiO2 is
   performed using density functional theory with Hubbard's energy
   correction (DFT C U). Monodoping with p-type (N) and n-type (Nb) dopants
   shows appreciable bandgap reduction, but leads to recombination centers
   due to the presence of uncompensated charges. To resolve this issue,
   charge compensation via codoping is attempted. The charge compensated
   codoping not only reduces the bandgap by 0.4 eV but also eliminates the
   bandgap states present in monodoped systems responsible for charge
   carrier recombination. Furthermore, the localized tail states present in
   the aTiO(2) system are eliminated to a large extent which leads to a
   decrease in the charge recombination and an increase in the charge
   migration. Thus, appropriate doping of amorphous TiO2 may lead to an
   alternative route for the development of visible light photocatalysts.}},

Title = {{Effect of one-way clutch on the nonlinear vibration of belt-drive
   systems with a continuous belt model}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF SOUND AND VIBRATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{332}},
Number = {{24}},
Pages = {{6472-6487}},
Month = {{NOV 25}},
Abstract = {{This study focuses on the nonlinear steady-state response of a
   belt-drive system with a one-way clutch. A dynamic model is established
   to describe the rotations of the driving pulley, the driven pulley, and
   the accessory shaft. Moreover, the model considers the transverse
   vibration of the translating belt spans for the first time in belt-drive
   systems coupled with a one-way clutch. The excitation of the belt-drive
   system is derived from periodic fluctuation of the driving pulley. In
   automotive systems, this kind of fluctuation is induced by the engine
   firing harmonic pulsations. The derived coupled discrete-continuous
   nonlinear equations consist of integro-partial-differential equations
   and piece-wise ordinary differential equations. Using the Galerkin
   truncation, a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations is
   obtained from the integro-partial-differential equations. Applying the
   Runge-Kutta time discretization, the time histories of the dynamic
   response are numerically solved for the driven pulley and the accessory
   shaft and the translating belt spans. The resonance areas of the coupled
   belt-drive system are determined using the frequency sweep. The effects
   of the one-way clutch on the belt-drive system are studied by comparing
   the frequency-response curves of the translating belt with and without
   one-way clutch device. Furthermore, the results of 2-term and 4-term
   Galerkin truncation are compared to determine the numerical convergence.
   Moreover, parametric studies are conducted to understand the effects of
   the system parameters on the nonlinear steady-state response. It is
   concluded that one-way clutch not only decreases the resonance amplitude
   of the driven pulley and shaft's rotational vibration, but also reduces
   the resonance region of the belts transverse vibration. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Maf (for multicopy associated filamentation) proteins represent a large
   family of conserved proteins implicated in cell division arrest but
   whose biochemical activity remains unknown. Here, we show that the
   prokaryotic and eukaryotic Maf proteins exhibit nucleotide
   pyrophosphatase activity against 5-methyl-UTP, pseudo-UTP, 5-methyl-CTP,
   and 7-methyl-GTP, which represent the most abundant modified bases in
   all organisms, as well as against canonical nucleotides dTTP, UTP, and
   CTP. Overexpression of the Maf protein YhdE. in E. coli cells increased
   intracellular levels of dTMP and UMP, confirming that dTTP and UTP are
   the in vivo substrates of this protein. Crystal structures and
   site-directed mutagenesis of Maf proteins revealed the determinants of
   their activity and substrate specificity. Thus, pyrophosphatase activity
   of Maf proteins toward canonical and modified nucleotides might provide
   the molecular mechanism for a dual role of these proteins in cell
   division arrest and house cleaning.}},

   metal-dependent endonuclease and 5'-> 3' exonuclease activities against
   single-stranded DNA, as well as ATP-independent DNA unwinding activity
   toward double-stranded DNA. The crystal structure of SSO0001 revealed a
   decameric toroid formed by five dimers with each protomer containing one
   {[}4Fe-4S] cluster and one Mn2+ ion bound in the active site located
   inside the internal tunnel. The conserved RecB motif and four Cys
   residues are important for DNA binding and cleavage activities, whereas
   DNA unwinding depends on several residues located near the {[}4Fe-4S]
   cluster. Our results suggest that Cas4 proteins might contribute to the
   addition of novel CRISPR spacers through the formation of 3'-DNA
   overhangs and to the degradation of foreign DNA.}},

   omnifocus laparoscope is equipped with an array of color video cameras,

Title = {{Diversity of reductive dehalogenase genes from environmental samples and
   enrichment cultures identified with degenerate primer PCR screens}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 19}},
Abstract = {{Reductive dehalogenases are the critical enzymes for anaerobic
   organohalide respiration, a microbial metabolic process that has been
   harnessed for bioremediation efforts to resolve chlorinated solvent
   contamination in groundwater and is implicated in the global halogen
   cycle. Reductive dehalogenase sequence diversity is informative for the
   dechlorination potential of the site or enrichment culture. A suite of
   degenerate PCR primers targeting a comprehensive curated set of
   reductive dehalogenase genes was designed and applied to 12 DNA samples
   extracted from contaminated and pristine sites, as well as six
   enrichment cultures capable of reducing chlorinated compounds to
   non-toxic end-products. The amplified gene products from four
   environmental sites and two enrichment cultures were sequenced using
   Illumina HiSeq, and the reductive dehalogenase complement of each sample
   determined. The results indicate that the diversity of the reductive
   dehalogenase gene family is much deeper than is currently accounted for:
   one-third of the translated proteins have less than 70\% pairwise amino
   acid identity to database sequences. Approximately 60\% of the sequenced
   reductive dehalogenase genes were broadly distributed, being identified
   in four or more samples, and often in previously sequenced genomes as
   well. In contrast, 17\% of the sequenced reductive dehalogenases were
   unique, present in only a single sample and bearing less than 90\%
   pairwise amino acid identity to any previously identified proteins. Many
   of the broadly distributed reductive dehalogenases are uncharacterized
   in terms of their substrate specificity, making these intriguing targets
   for further biochemical experimentation. Finally, comparison of samples
   from a contaminated site and an enrichment culture derived from the same
   site 8 years prior allowed examination of the effect of the enrichment
   process.}},

Abstract = {{Theoretical analyses of charged membranes in aqueous solutions have long
   predicted that the electric double layer surrounding them contributes
   significantly to their mechanical properties. Here we report the first,
   direct experimental measurements of the effect of counterion
   concentration on the bending and area expansion modulus of cationic
   surfactant vesicles. Using the classical technique of micropipet
   aspiration coupled with a modified experimental protocol that is better
   suited for cationic vesicles, we successfully measure the mechanical
   properties of a double-tailed cationic surfactant, diethylesterdimethyl
   ammonium chloride (diC18:1 DEEDMAC) in CaCl2 solutions. It is observed
   that the area expansion modulus of the charged membrane exhibits no
   measurable dependence on the counterion concentration, in accordance
   with existing models of bilayer elasticity. The measured bending
   modulus, however, is found to vary nonmonotonically and exhibits a
   minimum in its variation with counterion concentration. The experimental
   results are interpreted based on theoretical calculations of charged and
   bare membrane mechanics. It is determined that the initial decrease in
   bending modulus with increasing counterion concentration may be
   attributed to a decreasing double layer thickness, while the subsequent
   increase is likely due to an increasing membrane thickness. These
   mechanical moduli measurements qualitatively confirm, for the first
   time, theoretical predictions of a nonmonotonic behavior and the
   opposing effects of ionic strength on the bending rigidity of charged
   bilayers.}},

Abstract = {{A similarity between chemical reactions and self-assembly of
   nanoparticles offers a strategy that can enrich both the synthetic
   chemistry and the nanoscience fields. Synthetic methods should enable
   quantitative control of the structural characteristics of nanoparticle
   ensembles such as their aggregation number or directionality, whereas
   the capability to visualize and analyze emerging nanostructures using
   characterization tools can provide insight into intelligent molecular
   design and mechanisms of chemical reactions. We explored this twofold
   concept for an exemplary system including the polymerization of
   bifunctional nanoparticles in the presence of monofunctional colloidal
   chain stoppers. Using reaction- specific design rules, we synthesized
   chain stoppers with controlled reactivity and achieved quantitative
   fine-tuning of the selfassembled structures. Analysis of the
   nanostructures provided information about polymerization kinetics, side
   reactions, and the distribution of all of the species in the reaction
   system. A quantitative model was developed to account for the
   reactivity, kinetics, and side reactions of nanoparticles, all governed
   by the design of colloidal chain stoppers. This work provided the
   ability to test theoretical models developed for molecular
   polymerization.}},

Abstract = {{Recent computational fluid dynamics (CFD) studies relate abnormal blood
   flow to rupture of cerebral aneurysms. However, it is still debated how
   to model blood flow with sufficient accuracy. Common assumptions made
   include Newtonian behaviour of blood, traction free outlet boundary
   conditions and inlet boundary conditions based on available literature.
   These assumptions are often required since the available patient
   specific data is usually restricted to the geometry of the aneurysm and
   the surrounding vasculature. However, the consequences of these
   assumptions have so far been inadequately addressed.
   This study investigates the effects of 4 different viscosity models, 2
   different inflow conditions and 2 different outflow conditions in 12
   middle cerebral artery aneurysms. The differences are quantified in
   terms of 3 different wall shear stress (WSS) metrics, involving maximal
   WSS, average WSS, and proportion of aneurysm sac area with low WSS. The
   results were compared with common geometrical metrics such as volume,
   aspect ratio, size ratio and parent vessel diameter and classifications
   in terms of sex and aneurysm type.
   The results demonstrate strong correlations between the different
   viscosity models and boundary conditions. The correlation between the
   different WSS metrics range from weak to medium. No strong correlations
   were found between the different WSS metrics and the geometrical metrics
   or classifications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Birefringence tunability is demonstrated in waveguides formed in bulk
   fused silica and in the core of single mode fibers, by femtosecond laser
   writing of stress inducing tracks that are placed with different
   geometries around the core of the waveguides. The femtosecond laser
   generated stress effect was probed by the birefringence induced spectral
   splitting of either Bragg grating waveguides in bulk fused silica or
   weakly modulated, femtosecond laser induced Bragg gratings in optical
   fibers. Birefringence values as low as 4 x 10(-6) and up to 2 x 10(-3)
   were obtained by controlling the fabrication conditions such as the
   laser pulse energy, the writing femtosecond laser polarization, the
   number of overwriting exposures, and the geometry of the induced stress
   tracks. Wave retarders are developed and characterized by a cross
   polarization technique to provide the spectral response of the stress
   induced birefringence, offering the convenient fabrication of short

Abstract = {{Nonlinear registration algorithms provide a way to estimate structural
   (brain) differences based on magnetic resonance images. Their ability to
   align images of different individuals and across modalities has been
   well-researched, but the bounds of their sensitivity with respect to the
   recovery of salient morphological differences between groups are
   unclear. Here we develop a novel approach to simulate deformations on MR
   brain images to evaluate the ability of two registration algorithms to
   extract structural differences corresponding to biologically plausible
   atrophy and expansion. We show that at a neuroanatomical level
   registration accuracy is influenced by the size and compactness of
   structures, but do so differently depending on how much change is
   simulated. The size of structures has a small influence on the recovered
   accuracy. There is a trend for larger structures to be recovered more
   accurately, which becomes only significant as the amount of simulated
   change is large. More compact structures can be recovered more
   accurately regardless of the amount of simulated change. Both tested
   algorithms underestimate the full extent of the simulated atrophy and
   expansion. Finally we show that when multiple comparisons are corrected
   for at a voxelwise level, a very low rate of false positives is
   obtained. More interesting is that true positive rates average around
   40\%, indicating that the simulated changes are not fully recovered.
   Simulation experiments were run using two fundamentally different
   registration algorithms and we identified the same results, suggesting
   that our findings are generalizable across different classes of
   nonlinear registration algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Vibrations and impact loads are common sources of mechanical damage in
   transportation applications; however, their impacts on polymer
   electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) have yet to be fully
   investigated. In this work, the damage propagation in the membrane
   electrode assembly (MEA) is investigated under vibration conditions with
   a focus placed on the interface between the membrane and catalyst layer
   at the cathode. A numerical model based on the cohesive element approach
   is developed, and a parametric study is performed to investigate the
   effects of amplitude and frequency of applied vibrations as well as
   initial delamination length on damage propagation. Non-linear
   relationships were found between the damage propagation and these
   parameters, with the frequency of vibration having the dominant effect
   on damage propagation at larger amplitudes. This work provides insight
   into the importance of considering mechanical damage to the MEA under
   vibration conditions in transportation applications. Copyright (C) 2013,

Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW X}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{3}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV 12}},
Abstract = {{Active electromagnetic cloaking uses an array of elementary sources to
   cancel the scattered fields created by an object. An active interior
   cloak does this by placing the sources along the boundary of the object.
   This process can be thought of as introducing a discontinuity in the
   field to cancel out the scattered field by the object. Here, an
   experimental version of a thin active cloak at microwave frequencies is
   demonstrated for an aluminum cylinder with a radius of 0.56 lambda. The
   cloak consists of a 12-element magnetic-dipole array. By controlling the
   weights of the current on each element of the array, the scattering off
   of the cylinder is reduced in the backward and forward directions. The
   ability to disguise the aluminum cylinder as another object by varying
   the weights of the dipole array is also demonstrated. Finally, potential
   ways of overcoming the constraint of requiring a priori knowledge of the
   incident field leading to camouflaging-type behavior are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Photocarrier radiometry (PCR) has been applied to PbS colloidal quantum
   dot (CQD) thin films for the absolute measurement of emission lifetimes.
   Continuous and discrete models describing lifetime distribution have
   been developed. The former (a yields homogeneous and inhomogeneous Voigt
   lifetime broadening. The latter comprises two models: one is based on
   direct ad hoc fits to PCR amplitude and phase data, reconstructing a
   superposition of multiple independent lifetime line spectra; the other
   is a variational method developed to invert simultaneous integral
   equations in the lifetime distribution function (spectrum) and involves
   similar fits to the PCR in-phase and quadrature signal channels to
   reconstruct the lifetime spectrum. A PCR theory with a rate equation
   model taking into account the lowest 1S-1S exciton state splitting and
   multiphonon-assisted carrier trapping to states outside a PbS QD was
   also developed. For noninteracting (uncoupled) CQDs, longitudinal
   optical (LO) phonon-exciton interactions limit the radiative lifetime
   and luminescence photon flux throughout the entire 100-300 K temperature
   range. For interacting (coupled) CQDs, variational and ad hoc lifetime
   line spectra exhibit similar mechanisms to uncoupled CQDs with the
   important addition of direct exciton-to-exciton transitions in the form
   of efficient transport (hopping, tunneling, or FRET) at all
   temperatures, which result in de-excitation dynamics dominated by
   radiative emission channels.}},

   distribution}},
Journal = {{NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{15}},
Month = {{NOV 7}},
Abstract = {{A novel protocol, measurement-device-independent quantum key
   distribution (MDI-QKD), removes all attacks from the detection system,
   the most vulnerable part in QKD implementations. In this paper, we
   present an analysis for practical aspects of MDI-QKD. To evaluate its
   performance, we study various error sources by developing a general
   system model. We find that MDI-QKD is highly practical and thus can be
   easily implemented with standard optical devices. Moreover, we present a
   simple analytical method with only two (general) decoy states for the
   finite decoy-state analysis. This method can be used directly by
   experimentalists to demonstrate MDI-QKD. By combining the system model
   with the finite decoy-state method, we present a general framework for
   the optimal choice of the intensities of the signal and decoy states.
   Furthermore, we consider a common situation, namely asymmetric MDI-QKD,
   in which the two quantum channels have different transmittances. We
   investigate its properties and discuss how to optimize its performance.
   Our work is of interest not only to experiments demonstrating MDI-QKD
   but also to other non-QKD experiments involving quantum interference.}},

Title = {{Do Aging and Dual-Tasking Impair the Capacity to Store and Retrieve
   Visuospatial Information Needed to Guide Perturbation-Evoked
   Reach-To-Grasp Reactions?}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{A recent study involving young adults showed that rapid
   perturbation-evoked reach-to-grasp balance-recovery reactions can be
   guided successfully with visuospatial-information (VSI) retained in
   memory despite: 1) a reduction in endpoint accuracy due to recall-delay
   (time between visual occlusion and perturbation-onset, PO) and 2)
   slowing of the reaction when performing a concurrent cognitive task
   during the recall-delay interval. The present study aimed to determine
   whether this capacity is compromised by effects of aging. Ten healthy
   older adults were tested with the previous protocol and compared with
   the previously-tested young adults. Reactions to recover balance by
   grasping a small handhold were evoked by unpredictable antero-posterior
   platform-translation (barriers deterred stepping reactions), while using
   liquid-crystal goggles to occlude vision post-PO and for varying
   recall-delay times (0-10s) prior to PO (the handhold was moved
   unpredictably to one of four locations 2s prior to vision-occlusion).
   Subjects also performed a spatial-or non-spatial-memory cognitive task
   during the delay-time in a subset of trials. Results showed that older
   adults had slower reactions than the young across all experimental
   conditions. Both age groups showed similar reduction in medio-lateral
   end-point accuracy when recall-delay was longest (10s), but differed in
   the effect of recall delay on vertical hand elevation. For both age
   groups, engaging in either the non-spatial or spatial-memory task had
   similar (slowing) effects on the arm reactions; however, the older
   adults also showed a dual-task interference effect (poorer
   cognitive-task performance) that was specific to the spatial-memory
   task. This provides new evidence that spatial working memory plays a
   role in the control of perturbation-evoked balance-recovery reactions.
   The delays in completing the reaction that occurred when performing
   either cognitive task suggest that such dual-task situations in daily
   life could increase risk of falling in seniors, particularly when
   combined with the general age-related slowing that was observed across
   all experimental conditions.}},

Title = {{Characterizing metabolic interactions in a clostridial co-culture for
   consolidated bioprocessing}},
Journal = {{BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{NOV 4}},
Abstract = {{Background: Clostridial co-culture containing cellulolytic and
   solventogenic species is a potential consolidated bioprocessing (CBP)
   approach for producing biochemicals and biofuels from cellulosic
   biomass. It has been demonstrated that the rate of cellulose utilization
   in the co-culture of Clostridium acetobutylicum and Clostridium
   cellulolyticum is improved compared to the mono-culture of C.
   cellulolyticum (BL 5:119-124, 1983). However, the metabolic interactions
   in this co-culture are not well understood. To investigate the metabolic
   interactions in this co-culture we dynamically characterized the
   physiology and microbial composition using qPCR.
   Results: The qPCR data suggested a higher growth rate of C.
   cellulolyticum in the co-culture compared to its mono-culture. Our
   results also showed that in contrast to the mono-culture of C.
   cellulolyticum, which did not show any cellulolytic activity under
   conditions similar to those of co-culture, the co-culture did show
   cellulolytic activity even superior to the C. cellulolyticum
   mono-culture at its optimal pH of 7.2. Moreover, experiments indicated
   that the co-culture cellulolytic activity depends on the concentration
   of C. acetobutylicum in the co-culture, as no cellulolytic activity was
   observed at low concentration of C. acetobutylicum, and thus confirming
   the essential role of C. acetobutylicum in improving C. cellulolyticum
   growth in the co-culture. Furthermore, butanol concentration of 350 mg/L
   was detected in the co-culture batch experiments.
   Conclusion: These results suggest the presence of synergism between
   these two species, while C. acetobutylicum metabolic activity
   significantly improves the cellulolytic activity in the co-culture, and
   allows C. cellulolyticum to survive under harsh co-culture conditions,
   which do not allow C. cellulolyticum to grow and metabolize cellulose
   independently. It is likely that C. acetobutylicum improves the
   cellulolytic activity of C. cellulolyticum in the co-culture through
   exchange of metabolites such as pyruvate, enabling it to grow and
   metabolize cellulose under harsh co-culture conditions.}},

Abstract = {{Difficulties in dewatering of biosludge result in economical and
   environmental issues for wastewater treatment plants. Various attempts
   have been made to overcome this problem by achieving some pretreatment
   on biosludge. The main purpose of all pretreatment methods is to modify
   the biosludge characteristics in such a way to boost settling of cells
   and solid particles of sludge, and to ease the release of water
   molecules from extracellular polymeric substances and cells and to
   facilitate flow of water through forming filter cake. The present work
   presents an overview of different properties of sludge and their
   measurement, the main reasons of sludge dewatering difficulty, the
   fundamentals of sludge dewatering and various proposed methods for
   sludge pretreatment. The advantages and drawbacks of different methods
   are described and the dominance of one over the others is discussed
   mostly with respect to energy requirement and environmental impacts.
   Some recommendations have been made for optimal application of each

Journal = {{PLOS GENETICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Oct4 is a widely recognized pluripotency factor as it maintains
   Embryonic Stem (ES) cells in a pluripotent state, and, in vivo, prevents
   the inner cell mass (ICM) in murine embryos from differentiating into
   trophectoderm. However, its function in somatic tissue after this
   developmental stage is not well characterized. Using a
   tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase and floxed alleles of Oct4, we
   investigated the effect of depleting Oct4 in mouse embryos between the
   pre-streak and headfold stages, similar to E6.0-E8.0, when Oct4 is found
   in dynamic patterns throughout the embryonic compartment of the mouse
   egg cylinder. We found that depletion of Oct4 similar to E7.5 resulted
   in a severe phenotype, comprised of craniorachischisis, random heart
   tube orientation, failed turning, defective somitogenesis and posterior
   truncation. Unlike in ES cells, depletion of the pluripotency factors
   Sox2 and Oct4 after E7.0 does not phenocopy, suggesting that similar to
   E7.5 Oct4 is required within a network that is altered relative to the
   pluripotency network. Oct4 is not required in extraembryonic tissue for
   these processes, but is required to maintain cell viability in the
   embryo and normal proliferation within the primitive streak. Impaired
   expansion of the primitive streak occurs coincident with Oct4 depletion
   similar to E7.5 and precedes deficient convergent extension which
   contributes to several aspects of the phenotype.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{This paper presents the development and validation of finite element
   (FE) models to simulate the behavior of a novel composite shear wall
   system consisting of two skins of profiled steel sheeting and an infill
   of concrete under in-plane loadings. This walling system has potential
   to be used as shear elements to resist lateral loads in steel framed
   building. Steel sheet-concrete connections are provided by intermediate
   fasteners along the height and width of the wall to generate composite
   action. The performance of two FE models using ``surface tie
   constrains{''} and ``contact surface{''} to simulate the steel
   sheet-concrete interface behavior is compared. FE model using the
   ``contact surface{''} is found to provide better simulation of the
   behavior of experimental composite walls. The FE model simulated
   stresses, failure mode, buckling patterns in the profiled steel sheet
   and concrete cracking are found comparable with those obtained from
   experiments. The validated models are then utilized to carry out an
   extensive parametric study to understand the influence of material and
   steel-concrete interaction parameters (concrete compressive strength,
   steel strength and interface connector spacing) on the structural
   behavior of composite shear walls. The parametric study provided
   information on the optimum spacing of interface connectors to prevent
   shear buckling of profiled steel sheets before failure. The developed
   finite element models are found to be capable of simulating the behavior
   of composite walls under in-plane loadings with reasonable degree of
   accuracy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Light concentration using hetero-junctions of anisotropic low
   permittivity metamaterials}},
Journal = {{LIGHT-SCIENCE \& APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{2}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Focusing incident power into an area of high concentration is of
   significant interest for various applications. In optics, this has been
   traditionally achieved with lenses where a higher curvature and lens
   permittivity typically result in shorter focal distances (low f/D). In
   this work, we present designs and techniques for collecting, refracting
   and guiding incident light into an area of high power concentration (a
   hot spot) at extremely short distances. Specifically, a flat low-profile
   focusing mechanism is presented using a hetero-junction of anisotropic
   metamaterials (MTMs). The hetero-junction is formed from two cleaved
   finite slabs of low (near zero) permittivity anisotropic MTMs with
   rotated optical axes. The MTMs have near zero longitudinal permittivity
   while matched in the transverse direction. Such MTMs are shown to
   provide a unique ability to bend the transverse magnetic or p-polarized
   light away from the normal and along the interface, contrary to
   conventional dielectrics, and with minimal reflections; hence allowing
   for a low profile design. Realizations in the optical regime are
   presented using periodic bilayers of metal and dielectric. The proposed
   hetero-junction focusing device concentrates the normally incident plane
   wave and/or beam into a corresponding focal region similar to a lens via
   multiple refractions. The hetero-junction is capable of creating a hot
   spot very close to the device, much closer than dielectric lenses and it
   significantly outperforms the size requirements of thick high curvature
   lenses with low f/D ratios. The proposed designs can find applications
   in various scenarios including solar and thermo photovoltaics,
   photodetectors, concentrated photovoltaics, non-imaging optics,
   micro-and nano-Fresnel lenses.}},

Volume = {{20}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Asthma is a common chronic condition. Work-related asthma
   (WRA) has a large socioeconomic impact and is increasing in prevalence
   but remains under-recognized. Although international guidelines
   recommend patient education, no widely available educational tool
   exists.
   OBJECTIVE: To develop a WRA educational website for adults with asthma.
   METHODS: An evidence-based database for website content was developed,
   which applied evidence-based website design principles to create a
   website prototype. This was subsequently tested and serially revised
   according to patient feedback in three moderated phases (one focus group
   and two interview phases), followed by face validation by asthma
   educators.
   RESULTS: Patients (n=10) were 20 to 28 years of age; seven (70\%) were
   female, three (30\%) were in university, two (20\%) were in college and
   five (50\%) were currently employed. Key format preferences included:
   well-spaced, bulleted text; movies (as opposed to animations); photos
   (as opposed to cartoons); an explicit listing of website aims on the
   home page; and an exploding tab structure. Participants disliked
   integrated games and knowledge quizzes. Desired informational content
   included a list of triggers, prevention/control methods, currently
   available tools and resources, a self-test for WRA, real-life scenario
   presentations, compensation information, information for colleagues on
   how to react during an asthma attack and a WRA discussion forum.
   CONCLUSIONS: The website met the perceived needs of young asthmatic
   patients. This resource could be disseminated widely and should be
   tested for its effects on patient behaviour, including job choice,
   workplace irritant/allergen avoidance and/or protective equipment,
   asthma medication use and physician prompting for management of WRA
   symptoms.}},

Abstract = {{This study presents a dc-dc converter based on the Marx generator
   principle of charging capacitors in parallel followed by reconnection in
   series for discharging and for creating higher voltage. The topology
   uses solid-state switches like IGBTs as well as diodes. The concept and
   the operation of converter are described as well as design steps. The
   validity of the design is confirmed using PSCAD/EMTDC software package.
   The topology is compared with the conventional boost where the Marx
   dc-dc converter is shown to be competitive and even advantageous for
   higher dc gain. A cascade configuration is also presented and a 5 kW
   prototype with two stages made of two capacitors per stage is presented
   for experimental validation of the concept.}},

Abstract = {{Multifunctional polymer matrix composites (PMCs) exhibiting increased
   thermal and electrical conductivity can be achieved by adding conductive
   carbon-based fillers in the polymer matrix. Emerging markets for
   thermally and electrically conductive PMCs include heat management
   devices in electronics, light emitting diodes, and/or photovoltaics
   cells as well as bipolar plates in fuel cells. In this study, the
   effects of microsized and nanosized carbon fillers {[}e.g., pitch-based
   carbon fibers (CF), multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWNT), and graphene
   nanoplatelets (GNPs)] on the multifunctional properties of polyphenylene
   sulfide (PPS) matrix composites were investigated. Among the three
   carbon-based fillers, experimental results revealed that GNPs were the
   most effective fillers to promote the PMC's effective thermal
   conductivity (k(eff)). The highest k(eff) of 1.94 W/m K was attained by
   adding 30.0 wt\% (i.e., 22.4 vol\%) of GNPs in the PPS matrix. The
   nano-sized MWNTs and GNPs had lower percolation threshold than the
   micron sized CFs to suppress the composite's electrical impedance.
   However, the coefficient of thermal expansion and the compressive
   elastic modulus of the composites were only slightly improved with the
   filler addition. The different levels of improvement in the composite's
   multifunctional properties can be related to the filler geometry, filler
   size, and the composite's phase morphology. POLYM. ENG. SCI.,

Journal = {{ENERGY AND BUILDINGS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{66}},
Pages = {{648-656}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs) in City of Toronto, Canada,
   contain more than half of the dwellings in the City and are responsible
   for a significant proportion of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
   associated with building energy-use in the residential sector. To
   efficiently reduce the impact of this sector, MURBs with the highest
   energy intensity need to be identified. Accordingly, this study examined
   correlations between building characteristics and energy use. A wide
   range of energy intensities were revealed and it was found that
   typology-specific energy-use trends could not be established. The energy
   intensity variability was attributed to differences in building
   operation and it was suggested that many buildings can realize improved
   energy performance by changing operating procedures. The building
   characteristics exhibiting the strongest correlations with energy use
   were fenestration ratio and boiler efficiency. However, the need for
   more uniform and complete building characteristic and energy use data
   was identified. This study concludes with recommendations to improve the
   quantity and quality of MURB energy-use data and building
   characteristics so that researchers can develop a more accurate and
   complete picture of the MURB energy-use in Toronto. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{In a traditional cellular network the base stations (BSs) are deployed
   regularly according to a pre-determined pattern modeled by hexagons. The
   deployment of a larger number of BSs improves the network performance.
   However, a dense regular deployment of BSs is prohibitively expensive
   and in most cases not feasible. Alternatively the network can grow in an
   organic fashion by the deployment of BSs according to the traffic
   demand. A high traffic demand in a given locality is reflected in a
   higher number of BSs deployed in the area. In this paper, we propose a
   practical framework for the resource allocation of cellular networks
   with an irregular BS deployment pattern. To this end, a network
   clustering technique is proposed which forms clusters of coordinating
   BSs. The coordinated resource allocation among the BSs within each
   cluster is devised to achieve proportional fairness. The performance of
   the proposed framework is evaluated with regular as well as irregular
   deployment of BSs. The results are compared against standard resource
   allocation techniques and show promising results.}},

Abstract = {{A dynamic optimization algorithm is proposed for the joint allocation of

   scheme mandatory in the LTE-Advanced standard. Following the general
   framework of Lyapunov optimization, we decompose the original problem
   into three sub-problems in the forms of convex programming, linear
   programming, and mixed-integer programming. We solve the last
   sub-problem in the Lagrange dual domain, showing that it has zero
   duality gap, and that a primal optimum can be obtained with probability
   one. The proposed algorithm dynamically adapts to traffic and channel
   fluctuations, it accommodates both instantaneous and average power
   constraints, and it obtains arbitrarily near-optimal sum utility of each
   user's average throughput. Simulation results demonstrate that the joint
   optimum can significantly outperform suboptimal alternatives.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Use of lignocellulosic biomass as a second generation feedstock in the
   biofuels industry is a pressing challenge. Among other difficulties in
   using lignocellulosic biomass, one major challenge is the optimal
   utilization of both 6-carbon (glucose) and 5-carbon (xylose) sugars by
   industrial microorganisms. Most industrial microorganisms preferentially
   utilize glucose over xylose owing to the regulatory phenomenon of carbon
   catabolite repression (CCR). Microorganisms that can co-utilize glucose
   and xylose are of considerable interest to the biofuels industry due to
   their ability to simplify the fermentation processes. However,
   elimination of CCR in microorganisms is challenging due to the multiple
   coordinating mechanisms involved. We report a novel algorithm, SIMUP,
   which finds metabolic engineering strategies To force co-utilization of
   two sugars, without Targeting the regulatory pathways of CCR. Mutants of
   Escherichia coli based on SIMUP algorithm showed predicted growth
   phenotypes and co-utilized glucose and xylose; however, consumed the
   sugars slower than the wild-type. Some solutions identified by the
   algorithm were based on stoichiometric imbalance and were no obvious
   from the metabolic network Topology. Furthermore, sequencing studies on
   the genes involved in CCR showed that he mechanism for co-utilization of
   the sugars could be different from previously known mechanisms. (C.)

Abstract = {{As colloidal quantum dot (CQD) optoelectronic devices continue to
   improve, interest grows in the scaled-up and automated synthesis of
   high-quality materials. Unfortunately, all reports of record-performance
   CQD photovoltaics have been based on small-scale batch syntheses. Here
   we report a strategy for flow reactor synthesis of PbS CQDs and prove
   that it leads to solar cells having performance similar to that of
   comparable batch-synthesized nanoparticles. Specifically, we find that,
   only when using a dual-temperature-stage flow reactor synthesis reported
   herein, are the CQDs of sufficient quality to achieve high performance.
   We use a kinetic model to explain and optimize the nucleation and growth
   processes in the reactor. Compared to conventional single-stage
   flow-synthesized CQDs, we achieve superior quality nanocrystals via the
   optimized dual-stage reactor, with high photoluminescence quantum yield
   (50\%) and narrow full width-half-maximum. The dual-stage flow reactor
   approach, with its versatility and rapid screening of multiple
   parameters, combined with its efficient materials utilization, offers an
   attractive path to automated synthesis of CQDs for photovoltaics and,
   more broadly, active optoelectronics.}},

Title = {{Factors affecting catalysis of copper corrosion products in NDMA
   formation from DMA in simulated premise plumbing}},

Volume = {{93}},
Number = {{11}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the effects of corrosion products of copper, a
   metal commonly employed in household plumbing systems, on
   N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) formation from a known NDMA precursor,
   dimethylamine (DMA). Copper-catalyzed NDMA formation increased with
   increasing copper concentrations, DMA concentrations, alkalinity and
   hardness, but decreased with increasing natural organic matter (NOM)
   concentration. pH influenced the speciation of chloramine and the
   interactions of copper with DMA. The transformation of monochloramine
   (NH2Cl) to dichloramine and complexation of copper with DMA were
   involved in elevating the formation of NDMA by copper at pH 7.0. The
   inhibiting effect of NOM on copper catalysis was attributed to the rapid
   consumption of NH2Cl by NOM and/or the competitive complexation of NOM
   with copper to limit the formation of DMA-copper complexes. Hardness
   ions, as represented by Ca2+, also competed with copper for binding

   formation. Common copper corrosion products also participated in these
   reactions but in different ways. Aqueous copper released from malachite
   {[}Cu2CO3(OH)(2)] was shown to promote NDMA formation while NDMA
   formation decreased in the presence of CuO, most likely due to the

Abstract = {{Ultrasound simulators relying on impulse response methods are faithful
   to the mechanisms of image formation from the underlying radio-frequency
   signals, but as a result tend to be relatively slow. At the other
   extreme are fast techniques, often motivated by the development of
   teaching and training simulators, which approximate the image formation
   processes rather than rigorously modeling the underlying physics.
   Previously, we have shown that transmit field distributions from linear
   phased-array transducers can be modeled accurately and efficiently using
   arrays of point sources. This approach is now extended to point
   sources/receivers, which allows for simulation of the transmit/receive
   fields, and thus the physical processes underlying ultrasound image
   formation. Field distributions and fast-time signals are shown to
   compare favorably to those obtained using the impulse response method.
   Doppler spectrogram and B-mode images derived from these signals also
   show excellent agreement with the results obtained using the impulse
   response method, but with a computational savings of nearly two orders
   of magnitude. Because of the inherent simplicity of our Fast and
   Mechanistic Ultrasound Simulation (FAMUS) approach, CPU parallelization
   was readily achieved, and further orders of magnitude speed
   improvements, and thus real-time performance, can be anticipated via
   extension to modern graphics processing units.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: High-resolution vascular imaging has not been achieved in the
   brain due to limitations of current clinical imaging modalities. The
   authors present a method for transcranial ultrasound imaging of single
   micrometer-size bubbles within a tube phantom.
   Methods: Emissions from single bubbles within a tube phantom were mapped
   through an ex vivo human skull using a sparse hemispherical receiver
   array and a passive beamforming algorithm. Noninvasive phase and
   amplitude correction techniques were applied to compensate for the
   aberrating effects of the skull bone. The positions of the individual
   bubbles were estimated beyond the diffraction limit of ultrasound to
   produce a super-resolution image of the tube phantom, which was compared
   with microcomputed tomography (micro-CT).
   Results: The resulting super-resolution ultrasound image is comparable
   to results obtained via the micro-CT for small tissue specimen imaging.
   Conclusions: This method provides superior resolution to deep-tissue
   contrast ultrasound and has the potential to be extended to provide
   complete vascular network imaging in the brain. (C) 2013 American

   quantify the uncertainties in deterministic models of the indoor radio

   uncertainty are considered, including randomness in the material
   properties, building geometry, and the spatial location of transmitting
   and receiving antennas. The polynomial chaos results are confirmed
   against Monte Carlo simulations and experimental measurements. The
   analysis shows the expected variation in the sector-averaged path loss
   can be considerable for relatively small input parameter uncertainties,
   leading to the conclusion that a single simulation run using `nominal

   interfaces. As part of this process, it is necessary to employ an

   permittivity tensor are discontinuous. This contribution proposes a
   second-order domain-splitting procedure that can accomplish this task
   without assuming that the permittivity tensor components are piecewise
   constant or diagonal. As explained, this feature is needed to exploit
   the full geometrical flexibility of structured grid generation. The
   proposed domain-splitting procedure consistently yields a global error
   that is second-order accurate even in extreme cases where the components
   of the permittivity tensor have a change of sign or a sharp jump.}},

Abstract = {{Intracortical microelectrodes play a prominent role in the operation of
   neural interfacing systems. They provide an interface for recording
   neural activities and modulating their behavior through electric
   stimulation. The performance of such systems is thus directly meliorated
   by advances in electrode technology. We present a new architecture for
   intracortical electrodes designed to increase the number of
   recording/stimulation channels for a given set of shank dimensions. The
   architecture was implemented on silicon using microfabrication process
   and fabricated 3-mm-long electrode shanks with six relatively large (110
   mu m x 110 mu m pads in each shank for electrographic signal recording
   to detect important precursors with potential clinical relevance and
   electrical stimulation to correct neural behavior with low-power
   dissipation in an implantable device. Moreover, an electrode mechanical
   design was developed to increase its stiffness and reduce shank
   deflection to improve spatial accuracy during an electrode implantation.
   Furthermore, the pads were post-processed using pulsated low current
   electroplating and reduced their impedances by similar to 30 times
   compared to the traditionally fabricated pads. The paper also presents
   microfabrication process, electrodes characterization, comparison to the
   commercial equivalents, and in vitro and in vivo validations.}},

   mid-IR (7.5-8.5 mu m) light through difference frequency generation
   (DFG) between a 1550 nm pump and 1950 nm signal. This represents the
   longest wavelength generated through DFG in a 2D waveguide mode in a

   across >2 mu m through appropriate tuning of the input pump and signal

Abstract = {{The effect of mechanical refining on the enzymatic digestibility of
   pretreated corn stover (PCS) was investigated. Low severity, dilute
   sulfuric acid PCS was subjected to mechanical refining using a
   bench-scale food processor blender, a PFI mill, a 12-inch laboratory
   disk refiner, and a 25 mm co-rotating twin-screw extruder. Glucose
   yields from enzymatic hydrolysis were improved by 10-15\% after blending
   and disk refining, while PFI refining and twin-screw extrusion showed a
   glucose yield improvement of 16-20\%. A pilot scale refining test using
   a Szego mill was performed and showed approximately 10\% improvements in
   biomass digestibility. This suggests the possibility to scale up a
   mechanical refining technique to obtain similar enzymatic digestibility
   glucose yield enhancement as achieved by PFI milling and extrusion
   technologies. Proposed mechanisms of each mechanical refining technology
   are presented and reasons for improvements in biomass digestibility are
   discussed in this paper. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {{Autonomic network management is an approach to the management of complex
   networks and services that incorporates the detection, diagnosis and
   reconfiguration, as well as optimization, of their performance. A
   control loop is fundamental as it facilitates the capture of the current
   state of the networks and the reconfiguration of network elements
   without human intervention. For new networking architectures such as
   software-defined networking and OpenFlow networks, in which the control
   plane is moved onto a centralized controller, an efficient control loop
   and decision making are more crucial. In this paper, we propose a
   cognitive control loop based on a cognitive model for efficient problem
   resolving and accurate decision making. In contrast to existing control
   loops, the proposed control loop provides reactive, deliberative and
   reflective loops for managing systems based on analysis of current
   status. In order to validate the proposed control loop, we applied it to
   fault management in OpenFlow networks and found that the protection
   mechanism provides fast recovery from single failures in OpenFlow
   networks, but it cannot cover multiple-failure cases. We therefore also
   propose a fast flow setup (FFS) algorithm for our control loop to manage
   multiple-failure scenarios. The proposed control loop adaptively uses
   protection and FFS based on analysis of failure situations. We evaluate
   the proposed control loop and the FFS algorithm by conducting failure
   recovery experiments and comparing its recovery time to those of
   existing methods. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents results from tests on time reinforced concrete

   contained widely spaced steel spirals, while seven were retrofitted with
   lateral fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) wraps. A number of ductility
   parameters related to curvature, displacement, and energy dissipation
   were used to evaluate the effects of FRP confinement. The results showed
   that FRP confinement effectively improved the seismic resistance of
   columns but displayed different characteristics from steel-confined
   columns. While curvature ductility and energy dissipation capacity of a
   section increase with an increase in FRP confinement, the displacement
   ductility does not increase beyond a limit. Lateral confinement also
   significantly enhances flexural strength of columns subjected to high
   axial loads. This is generally neglected by most design codes and may
   cause unsafe shear design. A procedure to evaluate the strength
   enhancement owing to lateral FRP confinement is proposed.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{199}},
Pages = {{15-22}},

Abstract = {{Axisymmetric Drop Shape Analysis (ADSA) has been extensively used for
   surface tension measurement. In essence, ADSA works by matching a
   theoretical profile of the drop to the extracted experimental profile,
   taking surface tension as an adjustable parameter. Of the three main
   building blocks of ADSA, i.e. edge detection, the numerical integration
   of the Laplace equation for generating theoretical curves and the
   optimization procedure, only edge detection (that extracts the drop
   profile line from the drop image) needs extensive study. For the purpose
   of this article, the numerical integration of the Laplace equation for
   generating theoretical curves and the optimization procedure will only
   require a minor effort. It is the aim of this paper to investigate how
   far the surface tension accuracy of drop shape techniques can be pushed
   by fine tuning and optimizing edge detection strategies for a given drop
   image. Two different aspects of edge detection are pursued here:
   sub-pixel resolution and pixel resolution. The effect of two sub-pixel
   resolution strategies, i.e. spline and sigmoid, on the accuracy of
   surface tension measurement is investigated. It is found that the number
   of pixel points in the fitting procedure of the sub-pixel resolution
   techniques is crucial, and its value should be determined based on the
   contrast of the image, i.e. the gray level difference between the drop
   and the background. On the pixel resolution side, two suitable and
   reliable edge detectors, i.e. Canny and SUSAN, are explored, and the
   effect of user-specified parameters of the edge detector on the accuracy
   of surface tension measurement is scrutinized. Based on the contrast of
   the image, an optimum value of the user-specified parameter of the edge
   detector, SUSAN, is suggested. Overall, an accuracy of 0.01 mJ/m(2) is
   achievable for the surface tension determination by careful fine tuning
   of edge detection algorithms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{An experimental investigation was conducted to evaluate the performance
   of various types of glass fibre reinforced polymer (GFRP) reinforcement,
   including bent stirrups and headed bars in concrete structures. Results
   from 11 large beams (400mm x 650mm x 3650 mm) tested in monotonic
   three-point flexure were selected for this paper; some specimens used
   GFRP bent-bar stirrups and some used double-headed straight bar shear
   reinforcement. Based on the results from the tests, specimens reinforced
   with bent-bar stirrups and specimens with headed-bar shear reinforcement
   were found to perform similarly up until the calculated flexural failure
   load. Beyond that, beams reinforced with bent-bar stirrups showed
   significantly more deformability due to confinement of concrete in
   flexural compression. Strains measured in the transverse reinforcement
   were found to exceed the code limitations, in some cases exceeding 200\%
   of the limit prescribed in both CSA S6 and ACI440.1R. It was also found
   that at loads close to the service conditions, the cracking behaviour
   was very similar for the beams reinforced with transverse headed bars
   and bent-bar stirrups. Finally, the concept of hybrid reinforcement
   systems for controlling deflections and cracking was introduced. Results
   from the experiments show promise that these systems can better control
   deflections and cracking at expected service load conditions.}},

Abstract = {{The cost and quality of regulation have been brought to the forefront of
   power system operations by renewable variability. We propose a
   regulation pricing methodology based on an idea of Berger and Schweppe:
   in the same manner that locational marginal prices are derived from the
   dual of economic dispatch, let regulation prices be the dual multipliers
   or costate of an optimal control problem. By specializing to the linear
   quadratic regulator, we formulate a regulation pricing policy, which in
   turn allows us to derive statistically correct payments such as
   imbalance fees. We then construct a Vickrey-Clarke-Grovesmechanismto
   induce selfish agents to honestly report their private valuations and
   costs of regulation. Semidefinite programming descriptions of the
   formulation can be embedded within standard convex economic dispatch
   constraint sets, enabling cooptimization of base load and regulation
   pricing. The approach mechanistically produces prices for any dynamic
   scenario, and can therefore be used to consolidate diverse regulation
   services. We demonstrate this feature by combining traditional frequency
   regulation, area control error, and the California Independent System
   Operator's Flexible Ramping Product in an example.}},

Abstract = {{Sticholysins (Sts) I and II (StI/II) are pore-forming toxins (PFTs)
   produced by the Caribbean Sea anemone Stichodactyla helianthus belonging
   to the actinoporin family, a unique class of eukaryotic PFTs exclusively
   found in sea anemones. The role of lipid phase co-existence in the
   mechanism of the action of membranolytic proteins and peptides is not
   clearly understood. As for actinoporins, it has been proposed that phase
   separation promotes pore forming activity. However little is known about
   the effect of sticholysins on the phase separation of lipids in
   membranes. To gain insight into the mechanism of action of sticholysins,
   we evaluated the effect of these proteins on lipid segregation using
   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and atomic force microscopy
   (AFM). New evidence was obtained reflecting that these proteins reduce
   line tension in the membrane by promoting lipid mixing. In terms of the

Abstract = {{Combination of three-dimensional (3D) IC technology and network on chip
   (NoC) is an effective solution to increase system scalability and also
   alleviate the interconnect problem in large-scale integrated circuits.
   However, because of the increased power density in 3D NoC systems and
   the destructive effect of high temperatures on chip reliability,
   applying thermal management solutions becomes crucial in such circuits.
   In this study, the authors propose a runtime distributed migration
   algorithm based on game theory to balance the heat dissipation among
   processing elements (PEs) in a 3D NoC chip multiprocessor. The objective
   of this algorithm is to minimise the 3D NoC system's peak temperature,
   as well as the overhead imposed on chip performance during migration.
   Owing to the high thermal correlation between adjacent PEs in the same
   stack in 3D NoCs, the authors model this multi-objective problem as a
   cooperative game. The simulation results indicate upto 23 and 27\%
   decrease in peak temperature, for the benchmarks that have the highest
   communication rate and the largest number of tasks, respectively. This
   comes at the price of slight migration overhead in terms of power-delay
   product.}},

   magnitudes of sensor noise. Second, participants in the EID condition
   exhibited more stable control; experiencing fewer and shorter
   oscillations around the target goals. This is the first study to

Abstract = {{This study investigated the melting and crystallization behaviors of
   polylactide (PLA) under highpressure CO2, N-2, and helium (He) using a
   high-pressure differential scanning calorimeter and a wide-angle X-ray
   diffractometer. The results showed that the PIA's melting temperature
   was depressed only when contacted with pressurized CO2 where at high CO2
   pressures the lubricating gas molecules induced more imperfect melt and
   cold crystals during the cooling and heating cycle. PLA's melt
   crystallization was analyzed during both isothermal and nonisothermal
   processes. In contrast to the effect of dissolved CO2 that expedited the
   PLA's crystallization rate, N-2 showed almost a neutral impact on the
   PLA's crystallization kinetics. Because of the lower solubility, N-2 gas
   dissolved in the PLA had a diminutive plasticization effect, and thereby
   it could only counterbalance its negative hydraulic pressure effect.
   Moreover, as the helium pressure increased, the PLA's final
   crystallinity was reduced due to the dominant effect of helium's
   hydraulic pressure. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The problem of designing physical-layer network coding (PNC) schemes via
   nested lattices is considered. Building on the compute-and-forward
   (C\&F) relaying strategy of Nazer and Gastpar, who demonstrated its
   asymptotic gain using information-theoretic tools, an algebraic approach
   is taken to show its potential in practical, nonasymptotic, settings. A
   general framework is developed for studying nested-lattice-based PNC
   schemes-called lattice network coding (LNC) schemes for short-by making
   a direct connection between C\&F and module theory. In particular, a
   generic LNC scheme is presented that makes no assumptions on the
   underlying nested lattice code. C\&F is reinterpreted in this framework,
   and several generalized constructions of LNC schemes are given. The
   generic LNC scheme naturally leads to a linear network coding channel
   over modules, based on which noncoherent network coding can be achieved.
   Next, performance/complexity tradeoffs of LNC schemes are studied, with
   a particular focus on hypercube-shaped LNC schemes. The error
   probability of this class of LNC schemes is largely determined by the
   minimum intercoset distances of the underlying nested lattice code.
   Several illustrative hypercube-shaped LNC schemes are designed based on
   Constructions A and D, showing that nominal coding gains of 3 to 7.5 dB
   can be obtained with reasonable decoding complexity. Finally, the
   possibility of decoding multiple linear combinations is considered and
   related to the shortest independent vectors problem. A notion of
   dominant solutions is developed together with a suitable
   lattice-reduction-based algorithm.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system
   is the most recognized green building certification program in North
   America. In order to be LEED certified, a building must earn a
   sufficient number of points, which are obtained through achieving
   certain credits or design elements. In LEED versions 1 and 2, each
   credit was worth one point. In version 3, the LEED system changed so
   that certain credits were worth more than one point. In this study, we
   develop an inverse optimization approach to examine how building
   designers intrinsically valued design elements in LEED version 2.
   Because of the change in the point system between version 2 and version
   3, we aim to determine whether building designers actually valued each
   credit equally, and if not, whether their valuations matched the values
   in version 3. Due to the large dimensionality of the inverse
   optimization problem, we develop an approximation to improve
   tractability. We apply our method to 306 different LEED-certified
   buildings in the continental United States. We find that building
   designers did not value all credits equally and that other factors such
   as cost, building type, and size, and certification level play a role in
   how the credits are valued. Overall, inverse optimization may provide a
   new method to assess historical data and support the design of future
   versions of LEED.}},

Abstract = {{In this work, the influence of wettability on the fluid-fluid
   interfacial area (a(nw)) in a three-dimensional (3D) self-affine rough
   fracture during non-wetting phase invasion was studied using the lattice
   Boltzmann method (LBM). The capillary pressure (P-c)-saturation
   (S-w)-interfacial area (P-c-S-w-a(nw)) relationship, irreducible water
   saturation, and a(nw) at non-wetting phase breakthrough time and at
   irreducible water saturation were determined for four different contact
   angles. The lower contact angles led to increases in both P-c and a(nw)
   for a given water saturation. The irreducible water saturation increased
   as contact angle decreased and the corresponding a(nw) at irreducible
   saturation also increased as contact angle decreased. Decreasing the
   contact angle with the corresponding increase in non-wetting phase entry
   pressures increased the number of fracture regions in which water became
   surrounded by NAPL and isolated. This consequently increased a(nw) for a
   given water saturation and increased the irreducible water saturation.
   The a(nw)-S-w curves from LBM for different contact angles were compared
   with a thermodynamically based model for the a(nw)-S-w relationship. The
   energy dissipation factors varied with contact angle, and were higher
   than typical values for porous media, indicating predictions of less
   energy dissipation in the fractures modeled than for previously studied
   porous media. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Micropipette aspiration (MA) has been widely used to measure the
   biomechanical properties of cells and biomaterials. To estimate material
   parameters from MA experimental data, analytical half-space models and
   inverse finite element (FE) analyses are typically used. The half-space
   model is easy to implement but cannot account for nonlinear material
   properties and complex geometrical boundary conditions that are inherent
   to MA. Inverse FE approaches can account for geometrical and material
   nonlinearities, but their implementation is resource-intensive and not
   widely available. Here, by making analogy between an analytical uniaxial
   tension model and a FE model of MA, we proposed an easily implementable
   and accurate method to estimate the material parameters of tissues
   tested by MA. We first adopted a strain invariant-based isotropic
   exponential constitutive model and implemented it in both the analytical
   uniaxial tension model and the FE model. The two models were fit to
   experimental data generated by MA of porcine aortic valve tissue (45
   spots on four leaflets) to estimate material parameters. We found no
   significant differences between the effective moduli estimated by the
   two models (), with the effective moduli estimated by the uniaxial
   tension model correlating significantly with those estimated by the FE
   model () with a linear regression slope that was not different than
   unity (). Thus, the analytical uniaxial tension model, which avoids
   solving resource-intensive numerical problems, is as accurate as the FE
   model in estimating the effective modulus of valve tissue tested by MA.}},

Abstract = {{While biological phenomena can serve as meaningful analogies to inspire
   innovative design, previous studies found that designers often use
   descriptions of biological phenomena in non-analogous ways. Two
   experiments were conducted with novice designers to investigate how to
   decrease the non-analogous use of biological phenomena in concept
   generation. Properly applied, a causal relation template, developed
   based on Gentner's framework of analogical reasoning, decreased
   participants' non-analogous concepts. We identified two further
   interventions that reduce the tendency to develop non-analogous
   concepts: (1) one-to-one mapping instructions and (2) mapping the source
   analog to multiple problem-independent scenarios before concept
   generation. Understanding and reducing non-analogous application of
   biological phenomena may enable designers to more fully take advantage
   of biomimetic, or biologically inspired, design. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{A major reason for dental resin composite restoration replacement is
   related to secondary caries promoted by acid production from bacteria
   including Streptococcus mutans (S. mutans). We hypothesized that S.
   mutans has esterase activities that degrade dental resin composites and
   adhesives. Standardized specimens of resin composite (Z250), total-etch
   (Scotchbond Multipurpose, SB), and self-etch (Easybond, EB) adhesives
   were incubated with S. mutans UA159 or uninoculated culture medium
   (control) for up to 30 days. Quantification of the BisGMA-derived
   biodegradation by-product, bishydroxy-propoxy-phenyl-propane (BisHPPP),
   was performed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Surface
   analysis of the specimens was performed by scanning electron microscopy
   (SEM). S. mutans was shown to have esterase activities in levels
   comparable with those found in human saliva. A trend of increasing
   BisHPPP release throughout the incubation period was observed for all
   materials and was more elevated in the presence of bacteria vs. control
   medium for EB and Z250, but not for SB (p < .05). SEM confirmed the
   increased degradation of all materials with S. mutans UA159 vs. control.
   S. mutans has esterase activities at levels that degrade resin
   composites and adhesives; degree of degradation was dependent on the
   material's chemical formulation. This finding suggests that the
   resin-dentin interface could be compromised by oral bacteria that
   contribute to the progression of secondary caries.}},

Abstract = {{Background: In vascularized composite allotransplantation, multiple
   types of tissue are transferred from donor to recipient as a single
   functional unit. This technique has been performed for upper extremity,
   face, and abdominal wall transplants, among many others. Objective: To
   review the existing cases of face and upper extremity vascularized
   composite allotransplantation performed to date and to describe the
   functional outcomes and challenges associated with this new procedure.
   We also review the immune suppression protocols required for these
   procedures.
   Methods: A literature review was performed using PubMed and online
   registries where available to identify patients who have undergone upper
   extremity and face transplant procedures. These were compiled and
   cross-referenced to abstracts, conference presentations, and press
   releases in the media to create a list of procedures performed to date.
   Results: More than seventy patients have undergone upper extremity
   transplantation with very good functional outcomes routinely achieved.
   Twenty-five face transplants were identified that have been completed to
   date and details regarding patient outcome are included. One cases of
   human face allotransplantation with pre- and post-operative images is
   included as an example of what can be achieved with this technique.
   Conclusions: Vascularized composite allotransplantation is an emerging
   field that provides an exciting new avenue for reconstructive procedures
   and achieves functional and cosmetic outcomes not previously possible
   with existing techniques. However, it is not without its challenges and
   considerable work is still required prior to widespread adoption of
   these new reconstructive techniques. (C) 2013 British Association of

Abstract = {{Granite exhibits anisotropy due to pre-existing microcracks under
   tectonic loadings; and the mechanical property anisotropy such as
   flexural/tensile strength is vital to many rock engineering
   applications. In this paper, Barre Granite is studied to understand the
   flexural strength anisotropy under a wide range of loading rates using
   newly proposed semi-circular bend tests. Static tests are conducted with
   a MTS hydraulic servo-control testing machine and dynamic tests with a
   split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system. Six samples groups are
   fabricated with respect to the three principle directions of Barre
   granite. Pulse shaping technique is used in all dynamic SHPB tests to
   facilitate dynamic stress equilibrium. Finite element method is utilized
   to build up equations calculating the flexural tensile strength. For
   samples in the same orientation group, a loading rate dependence of the
   flexural tensile strength is observed. The measured flexural tensile
   strength is higher than the tensile strength measured using Brazilian
   disc method at given loading rate and this scenario has been
   rationalized using a non-local failure theory. The flexural tensile
   strength anisotropy features obvious dependence on the loading rates,
   the higher the loading rate, the less the anisotropy and this phenomenon
   may be explained considering the interaction of the preferentially
   oriented microcracks.}},

Abstract = {{Robotic urban search and rescue (USAR) is a challenging yet promising
   research area which has significant application potentials as has been

   time-critical disaster scenes, recent efforts have been made to equip
   these robots with some level of autonomy. This paper provides a detailed
   overview of developments in the exciting and challenging area of robotic
   control for USAR environments. In particular, we discuss the efforts
   that have been made in the literature towards: 1) developing low-level
   controllers for rescue robot autonomy in traversing uneven terrain and
   stairs, and perception-based simultaneous localization and mapping
   (SLAM) algorithms for developing 3D maps of USAR scenes, 2) task sharing
   of multiple tasks between operator and robot via semi-autonomous

Abstract = {{Efficient and targeted cellular delivery of small interfering RNAs
   (siRNAs) and antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) is a major challenge
   facing oligonucleotide-based therapeutics. The majority of current
   delivery strategies employ either conjugated ligands or oligonucleotide
   encapsulation within delivery vehicles to facilitate cellular uptake.
   Chemical modification of the oligonucleotides (ONs) can improve potency
   and duration of activity, usually as a result of improved nuclease
   resistance. Here we take advantage of innovations in both polymeric
   delivery vehicles and ON stabilization to achieve receptor-mediated
   targeted delivery of siRNAs or AONs for gene silencing. Polymeric
   nanoparticles comprised of poly(lactide-co-2-methyl,
   2-carboxytrimethylene carbonate)-g-polyethylene glycol-furan/azide are
   click-modified with both anti-HER2 antibodies and nucleic acids on the
   exterior PEG corona. Phosphorothioate (PS), 2'F-ANA, and 2'F-RNA
   backbone chemical modifications improve siRNA and AON potency and
   duration of activity. Importantly, delivery of these nucleic acids on
   the exterior of the polymeric immuno-nanoparticles are as efficient in
   gene silencing as lipofectamine transfection without the associated
   potential toxicity of the latter. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{During sessile droplet evaporation, studies with IR thermography and
   shadowgraphs have indicated temperature pulsations. We confirm those
   observations with microthermocouples, but microthermocouples also
   indicate temperature pulsations in the atmosphere of the droplet. The
   pressure in this atmosphere pulsated as well and was correlated with the
   temperature pulsations in the droplet. Also, we find that if a droplet
   evaporates into its own vapor, there are no temperature or pressure
   pulsations. The pulsations occur only if the droplet evaporates into an
   atmosphere with a component having a heat of solution with the droplet
   when it adsorbs absorbs. None of the currently proposed mechanisms for
   the temperature pulsations provide an explanation for the coupling
   between the temperature pulsations in the droplet and the vapor-phase
   pressure pulsations, and for the absence of the pulsations when the
   system is single-component. As a mechanism for the pulsations, we
   propose that when a droplet is exposed to an atmosphere containing a
   component that has a heat of solution with the droplet, energy will be
   released from adsorption absorption. This energy will cause pulsations
   in the evaporation flux, and these pulsations could cause the observed
   temperature and pressure pulsations. We examine this mechanism by
   showing that, if the measured temperature pulsations in a water droplet
   exposed to a methanol atmosphere are used as the input to a theory of
   evaporation kinetics (statistical rate theory), the pressure pulsations
   of the water vapor in the methanol atmosphere are predicted and agree
   with those measured with a quadrupole mass analyzer. When the inputs and
   outputs are reversed in the theory, we find that the temperature
   pulsations in the droplet are correctly predicted from the measured
   water vapor pulsations in the atmosphere.}},

Abstract = {{There is a trend towards reducing bacterial harmfulness in recent years.
   Infection of medical devices and treatment rooms can result in
   significant morbidity and mortality. Having antibacterial surfaces such
   as silver and copper coatings the risk of bacteria growth has been
   decreased, noticeably. In the current study, wire arc spraying technique
   was employed to produce an ultra fine microstructure copper coating on
   stainless steel 316L substrates. This paper examined the microstructure
   and surface micromorphology of copper coatings by scanning electron
   microscope (SEM). The chemical composition was evaluated by X-ray
   diffraction (XRD). The roughness, surface free energy and wettability of
   the surfaces were characterized using surface roughness meter inception,
   dynamic contact angle meter (tensiometer). The antibacterial property of
   copper coatings was analyzed by ATCC 25922 Escherichia coli (gram
   negative) and bacteria ATCC 29213 Staphylococcus aureus (gram positive)
   and then was compared to stainless steel 316L and the commercially
   available copper sheet. The relationship between the contact angle and
   surface free energy (SFE) and antibacterial properties was studied.
   Results indicated that as-sprayed copper coatings showed the best
   bactericidal activities. The material surface characteristics including
   the high surface roughness, the high surface free energy, the low
   contact angle and other characteristics such as ultrafine grain
   structure and the chemical composition play key roles in increasing the
   antibacterial behavior of the surfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All

Pages = {{1971-1984}},

Abstract = {{Substructure hybrid simulation has been actively investigated and
   applied to evaluate the seismic performance of structural systems in
   recent years. The method allows simulation of structures by representing
   critical components with physically tested specimens and the rest of the
   structure with numerical models. However, the number of physical
   specimens is limited by available experimental equipment. Hence, the
   benefit of the hybrid simulation diminishes when only a few components
   in a large system can be realistically represented. The objective of the
   paper is to overcome the limitation through a novel model updating
   method. The model updating is carried out by applying calibrated
   weighting factors at each time step to the alternative numerical models,
   which encompasses the possible variation in the experimental specimen
   properties. The concept is proposed and implemented in the hybrid
   simulation framework, UI-SimCor. Numerical verification is carried out
   using two-DOF systems. The method is also applied to an experimental
   testing, which proves the concept of the proposed model updating method.

Title = {{Model-based analysis of mixed uranium(VI) reduction by biotic and
   abiotic pathways during in situ bioremediation}},
Journal = {{CHEMICAL GEOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{357}},
Pages = {{215-222}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{Given the numerous unknowns and uncertainties in sediment systems,
   understanding of the mechanisms of U(VI) reduction is still at the stage
   of improvement. Recent studies have shown that reductive immobilization
   of U(VI) in the subsurface is not caused by purely biological or purely
   abiotic reactions but rather a group of interconnected abiotic-biotic
   pathways (e. g. via mackinawite and biomass). These new findings
   necessitate an update of the existing mathematical models that make
   simplifications typically involving a single reducing agent (e. g.
   indigenous bacteria) for in situ bioremediation of uranium-contaminated
   groundwater. In this study, a comprehensive model was constructed based
   on new experimental observations, including mixed U(VI) reduction by
   chemical and enzymatic reactions. Thermodynamic analysis was done to
   predict the feasibility of the potential pathways that affect
   mackinawite formation under field conditions. Model simulations indicate
   that low concentrations of the reactant species make the reaction of
   homogeneous Fe(II) oxidation coupled to U(VI) reduction unfavorable in
   the field. Instead, FeS precipitation is an important Fe(II)
   sequestration reaction once sulfate metabolism dominates. The subsequent
   reduction of U(VI) by FeS (mackinawite) contributes to the total U(VI)
   removal under a variety of U(VI) concentrations encountered at field
   sites, which is in accordance with experimental observations. The model
   suggests the potential for both competition and coordination between
   chemical and biological pathways on the cell surface, providing a
   possible explanation as to why U(VI) can be efficiently reduced at
   either low or high sulfate concentration during the process of in situ
   bioremediation. Further increase in the resolution of the model (e. g.
   across multiple scales such as genome-, micron- and pore-sale) is
   necessary for better understanding of the interactions between biotic
   and abiotic pathways. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Collagen biomineralization is a complex process and the controlling
   factors at the molecular level are still not well understood. A
   particularly high level of spatial control over collagen mineralization
   is evident in the anchorage of teeth to the jawbone by the periodontal
   ligament. Here, unmineralized ligament collagen fibrils become
   mineralized at an extremely sharp mineralization front in the root of
   the tooth. A model of collagen biomineralization based on demineralized
   cryosections of mouse molars in the bone socket is presented. When
   exposed to metastable calcium and phosphate-containing solutions,
   mineral re-deposits selectively into the natively mineralized tissues
   with high fidelity, demonstrating that the extracellular matrix retains
   sufficient information to control the rate of mineralization at the
   tissue level. While solutions of simulated bodily fluid produce
   amorphous calcium phosphate within the tissue section, a more highly
   supersaturated solution stabilized with polyaspartic acid produces
   oriented, crystalline calcium phosphate with diffraction patterns
   consistent with hydroxyapatite. The model thus replicates both spatial
   control of mineral deposition, as well as the matrix-mineral
   relationships of natively mineralized collagen fibrils, and can be used
   to elucidate roles of specific biomolecules in the highly controlled
   process of collagen biomineralization. This knowledge will be critical
   in the design of collagen-based scaffolds for tissue engineering of
   hard-soft tissue interfaces.}},

   which C-H bonds in CH4 react on bare Pd clusters, Pd cluster surfaces
   saturated with chemisorbed oxygen (O{*}), and PdO clusters. C-H
   activation routes change from oxidative addition to H-abstraction and
   then to sigma-bond metathesis with increasing O-content, as active sites
   evolve from metal atom pairs ({*}-{*}) to oxygen atom (O{*}-O{*}) pairs
   and ultimately to Pd cation-lattice oxygen pairs (Pd2+-O2-) in PdO. The
   charges in the CH3 and H moieties along the reaction coordinate depend
   on the accessibility and chemical state of the Pd and O centers
   involved. Homolytic C-H dissociation prevails on bare ({*}-{*}) and
   O{*}-covered surfaces (O{*}-O{*}), while C-H bonds cleave
   heterolytically on Pd2+-O2- pairs at PdO surfaces. On bare surfaces, C-H
   bonds cleave via oxidative addition, involving Pd atom insertion into
   the C-H bond with electron backdonation from Pd to C-H antibonding
   states and the formation of tight three-center (H3C center dot center
   dot center dot Pd center dot center dot center dot H)double dagger
   transition states. On O{*}-saturated Pd surfaces, C-H bonds cleave
   homolytically on O{*}-O{*} pairs to form radical-like CH3 species and
   nearly formed O-H bonds at a transition state (O{*}center dot center dot
   center dot CH3 center dot center dot center dot center dot{*}OH)double
   dagger that is looser and higher in enthalpy than on bare Pd surfaces.
   On PdO surfaces, site pairs consisting of exposed Pd2+ and vicinal O2-,
   Pd-ox-O-ox, cleave C-H bonds heterolytically via sigma-bond metathesis,
   with Pd2+ adding to the C-H bond, while O2- abstracts the H-atom to form
   a four-center (H3C delta-center dot center dot center dot Pd-ox center
   dot center dot center dot H delta+center dot center dot center dot
   O-ox)double dagger transition state without detectable Pd-ox reduction.
   The latter is much more stable than transition states on {*}-{*} and
   O{*}-O{*} pairs and give rise to a large increase in CH4 oxidation
   turnover rates at oxygen chemical potentials leading to Pd to PdO
   transitions. These distinct mechanistic pathways for C-H bond
   activation, inferred from theory and experiment, resemble those
   prevalent on organometallic complexes. Metal centers present on surfaces
   as well as in homogeneous complexes act as both nucleophile and
   electrophile in oxidative additions, ligands (e.g., O{*} on surfaces)
   abstract H-atoms via reductive deprotonation of C-H bonds, and
   metal-ligand pairs, with the pair as electrophlle and the metal as
   nucleophile, mediate sigma-bond metathesis pathways.}},

Abstract = {{Epithelial tissues are protective barriers that display a remarkable
   ability to repair wounds. Wound repair is often associated with an
   accumulation of actin and nonmuscle myosin II around the wound, forming
   a purse string. The role of actomyosin networks in generating mechanical
   force during wound repair is not well understood. Here we investigate
   the mechanisms of force generation during wound repair in the epidermis
   of early and late Drosophila embryos. We find that wound closure is
   faster in early embryos, where, in addition to a purse string around the
   wound, actomyosin networks at the medial cortex of the wounded cells
   contribute to rapid wound repair. Laser ablation demonstrates that both
   medial and purse-string actomyosin networks generate contractile force.
   Quantitative analysis of protein localization dynamics during wound
   closure indicates that the rapid contraction of medial actomyosin
   structures during wound repair in early embryos involves disassembly of
   the actomyosin network. By contrast, actomyosin purse strings in late
   embryos contract more slowly in a mechanism that involves network
   condensation. We propose that the combined action of two
   force-generating structures-a medial actomyosin network and an
   actomyosin purse string-contributes to the increased efficiency of wound
   repair in the early embryo.}},

Abstract = {{We introduce an automated digital microfluidic (DMF) platform capable of
   performing immunoassays from sample to analysis with minimal manual
   intervention. This platform features (a) a 90 Pogo pin interface for
   digital microfluidic control, (b) an integrated (and motorized)
   photomultiplier tube for chemiluminescent detection, and (c) a magnetic
   lens assembly which focuses magnetic fields into a narrow region on the
   surface of the DMF device, facilitating up to eight simultaneous digital
   microfluidic magnetic separations. The new platform was used to
   implement a three-level full factorial design of experiments (DOE)
   optimization for thyroid-stimulating hormone immunoassays, varying (1)
   the analyte concentration, (2) the sample incubation time, and (3) the
   sample volume, resulting in an optimized protocol that reduced the
   detection limit and sample incubation time by up to 5-fold and 2-fold,
   respectively, relative to those from previous work. To our knowledge,
   this is the first report of a DOE optimization for immunoassays in a
   microfluidic system of any format. We propose that this new platform
   paves the way for a benchtop tool that is useful for implementing
   immunoassays in near-patient settings, including community hospitals,
   physicians' offices, and small clinical laboratories.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, there are many situations where the quality of a process is
   characterized by a relationship of functional data (or profiles) such as
   time series and image data. Such data have been used for detecting
   out-of-process and quality improvement in many engineering applications
   such as semiconductor manufacturing, automobile manufacturing, and
   nano-machining systems. The functional data contain high dimensionality,
   high feature correlation, non-stationality, and large amount of noise.
   Due to such characteristics, most classic statistical process control
   (SPC) may not perform on-line monitoring satisfactorily on functional
   data. In addition, local shift monitoring with functional data is more
   significant than the detection of global shifting patterns. In this
   paper, wavelet-based exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) test
   statistic with adaptive thresholding method, which extracts several
   significant coefficients from original functional data in the wavelet
   domain and monitors out-of-control events, is proposed. Instead of
   monitoring global shifting, the local shifting in functional data is of
   major significance in our study. Throughout this study, we use a
   spectroscopy in monitoring of plasma etching process from semiconductor
   manufacturing to illustrate the implementation of the proposed approach.
   Experiment studies show that the proposed approach quickly detects
   smaller local shifts compared with the well-known methods. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Solution processed colloidal quantum dot (CQD) solar cells have great
   potential for large area low-cost photovoltaics. However, light
   utilization remains low mainly due to the tradeoff between small carrier
   transport lengths and longer infrared photon absorption lengths. Here,
   we demonstrate a bottom-illuminated periodic nanostructured CQD solar
   cell that enhances broadband absorption without compromising charge
   extraction efficiency of the device. We use finite difference time
   domain (FDTD) simulations to study the nanostructure for implementation
   in a realistic device and then build proof-of-concept nanostructured
   solar cells, which exhibit a broadband absorption enhancement over the
   wavelength range of l 5 600 to 1100 nm, leading to a 31\% improvement in
   overall short-circuit current density compared to a planar device
   containing an approximately equal volume of active material. Remarkably,
   the improved current density is achieved using a light-absorber volume
   less than half that typically used in the best planar devices.}},

Title = {{Xylo- and cello-oligosaccharide oxidation by gluco-oligosaccharide
   oxidase from Sarocladium strictum and variants with reduced substrate
   inhibition}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{Background: The oxidation of carbohydrates from lignocellulose can
   facilitate the synthesis of new biopolymers and biochemicals, and also
   reduce sugar metabolism by lignocellulolytic microorganisms, reserving
   aldonates for fermentation to biofuels. Although oxidoreductases that
   oxidize cellulosic hydrolysates have been well characterized, none have
   been reported to oxidize substituted or branched xylo-oligosaccharides.
   Moreover, this is the first report that identifies amino acid
   substitutions leading to GOOX variants with reduced substrate
   inhibition.
   Results: The recombinant wild type gluco-oligosaccharide oxidase (GOOX)
   from the fungus Sarocladium strictum, along with variants that were
   generated by site-directed mutagenesis, retained the FAD cofactor, and
   showed high activity on cello-oligosaccharide and xylo-oligosaccharides,
   including substituted and branched xylo-oligosaccharides. Mass
   spectrometric analyses confirmed that GOOX introduces one oxygen atom to
   oxidized products, and H-1 NMR and tandem mass spectrometry analysis
   confirmed that oxidation was restricted to the anomeric carbon. The A38V
   mutation, which is close to a predicted divalent ion-binding site in the
   FAD-binding domain of GOOX but 30 angstrom away from the active site,
   significantly increased the k(cat) and catalytic efficiency of the
   enzyme on all oligosaccharides. Eight amino acid substitutions were
   separately introduced to the substrate-binding domain of GOOX-VN (at
   positions Y72, E247, W351, Q353 and Q384). In all cases, the K-m of the
   enzyme variant was higher than that of GOOX, supporting the role of
   corresponding residues in substrate binding. Most notably, W351A
   increased K-m values by up to two orders of magnitude while also
   increasing k(cat) up to 3-fold on cello-and xylo-oligosaccharides and
   showing no substrate inhibition.
   Conclusions: This study provides further evidence that S. strictum GOOX
   has broader substrate specificity than the enzyme name implies, and that
   substrate inhibition can be reduced by removing aromatic side chains in
   the -2 binding subsite. Of the enzyme variants, W351A might be
   particularly advantageous when oxidizing oligosaccharides present at

Abstract = {{Cell-cell contacts are fundamental to multicellular organisms and are
   subject to exquisite levels of control. The carcinoembryonic
   antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) can engage in both
   cis-homophilic (parallel) oligomerization and
   trans-homophilic(anti-parallel) binding. In this study, we establish
   that the CEACAM1 transmembrane domain has a propensity to form
   cis-dimers via the transmembrane-embedded (432)GXXXG(436) motif and that
   this basal state is overcome when activated calmodulin binds to the
   CEACAM1 cytoplasmic domain. Although mutation of the (432)GXXXG(436)
   motif reduced CEACAM1 oligomerization, it did not affect surface
   localization of the receptor or influence CEACAM1-dependent cellular
   invasion by the pathogenic Neisseria. The mutation did, however, have a
   striking effect on CEACAM1-dependent cellular aggregation, increasing
   both the kinetics of cell-cell association and the size of cellular
   aggregates formed. CEACAM1 association with tyrosine kinase c-Src and
   tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and SHP-2 was not affected by the
   (432)GXXXG(436) mutation, consistent with their association with the
   monomeric form of wild type CEACAM1. Collectively, our results establish
   that a dynamic oligomer-to-monomer shift in surface-expressed CEACAM1
   facilitates trans-homophilic binding and downstream effector signaling.}},

Title = {{Disruption of superlattice phonons by interfacial mixing}},
Journal = {{PHYSICAL REVIEW B}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{88}},
Number = {{15}},
Month = {{OCT 11}},
Abstract = {{Molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics calculations are
   used to study the vibrational modes and thermal transport in
   Lennard-Jones superlattices with perfect and mixed interfaces. The
   secondary periodicity of the superlattices leads to a vibrational
   spectrum (i.e., dispersion relation) that is distinct from the bulk
   spectra of the constituent materials. The mode eigenvectors of the
   perfect superlattices are found to be good representations of the
   majority of the modes in the mixed superlattices for up to 20\%
   interfacial mixing, allowing for extraction of phonon frequencies and
   lifetimes. Using the frequencies and lifetimes, the in-plane and
   cross-plane thermal conductivities are predicted using a solution of the
   Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), with agreement found with
   predictions from the Green-Kubo method for the perfect superlattices.
   For the mixed superlattices, the Green-Kubo and BTE predictions agree
   for the cross-plane direction, where thermal conductivity is dominated
   by low-frequency modes whose eigenvectors are not affected by the
   mixing. For the in-plane direction, mid-frequency modes that contribute
   to thermal transport are disrupted by the mixing, leading to an
   underprediction of thermal conductivity by the BTE. The results
   highlight the importance of using a dispersion relation that includes
   the secondary periodicity when predicting phonon properties in perfect
   superlattices and emphasize the challenges of estimating the effects of
   disorder on phonon properties.}},

Abstract = {{Chondroitinase ABC (ChABC) is a promising therapeutic for spinal cord
   injury as it can degrade the glial scar that is detrimental to regrowth
   and repair. However, the sustained delivery of bioactive ChABC is a
   challenge requiring highly invasive methods such as intra-spinal
   injections, insertion of intrathecal catheters, or implantation of
   delivery vehicles directly into the tissue. ChABC is thermally unstable,
   further complicating its delivery. Moreover, there are no commercial
   antibodies available for its detection. To achieve controlled release,
   we designed an affinity-based system that sustained the release of
   bioactive ChABC for at least 7 days. ChABC was recombinantly expressed
   as a fusion protein with Src homology domain 3 (SH3) with an N-terminal
   histidine (HIS) tag and a C-terminal FLAG tag (ChABC-SH3). Protein
   purification was achieved using a nickel affinity column and, for the
   first time, direct quantification of ChABC down to 0.1 nM was attained
   using an in-house HIS/FLAG double tag ELISA. The release of active
   ChABC-SH3 was sustained from a methylcellulose hydrogel covalently
   modified with an SH3 binding peptide. The rate of release was tunable by
   varying either the binding strength of the SH3-protein/SH3-peptide pair
   or the SH3-peptide to SH3-protein ratio. This innovative system has the
   potential to be used as a platform technology for the release and
   detection of other proteins that can be expressed using a similar
   construct. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Enhanced radiation of an invisible array of sources through a
   sub-wavelength metal-strip grating and applications}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 7}},
Abstract = {{We experimentally demonstrate dramatically increased radiation from an
   ``invisible{''} source placed next to a sub-wavelength metal strip
   grating. The invisible source is a novel, highly reactive, array of
   antennas excited by a common feed, which weakly radiates in the
   far-zone. The metal grating used is sub-wavelength and non-resonant,
   which typically attenuates the overall radiation of a nearby source,
   especially in the transverse electric polarization. However, we show
   that such a grating screen with proper dimensions placed next to the
   ``invisible{''} source can in fact significantly enhance the radiated
   field strength, far beyond the free space radiation of this
   ``invisible{''} radiator, by an order of magnitude. This radiation
   enhancement is facilitated through the conversion of evanescent waves of
   the specially designed reactive source into propagating waves, and its
   level is inversely related to the source-grating distance. The physical
   phenomenon is shown in simulations and measurements at microwaves. This
   novel radiation enhancement effect is shown to have potential
   applications in various areas such as proximity sensing, detection, and
   measurement of distance. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{The conjugated polymer
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) is
   subjected to non-adiabatic rapid thermal processing and exhibits an
   increase in conductivity through the film. Electrical measurements on an
   ITO/PEDOT:PSS/Al diode structure display a current-voltage relationship
   that correlates to space charge limited conduction with the presence of
   an exponential trap distribution, which is commonly seen in other
   organic media. With careful application of this current transport theory
   to the obtained experimental results, the root cause of the conductivity
   enhancement can be attributed solely to an increase in the charge
   mobility of carriers in the PEDOT: PSS film. In comparison to an
   untreated PEDOT: PSS film, processing at 200 degrees C for 30 s results
   in a 35\% increase in carrier mobility to 0.0128 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Values
   for other material characteristics of PEDOT: PSS can also be extracted
   from this electrical analysis, and additionally are found to be
   unchanged with processing. Hole concentration, effective density of
   states, and total trap density are found to be 7.4 x 10(14) cm(-3), 1.5

Abstract = {{Temperature-compensated 3D fiber shape sensing is demonstrated with
   femtosecond laser direct-written optical and Bragg grating waveguides
   that were distributed axially and radially inside a single coreless

   Simultaneous interrogation of nine Bragg gratings, distributed along
   three laterally offset waveguides, is presented through a single
   waveguide port at 1 kHz sampling rate to follow the Bragg wavelength
   shifts in real-time and thereby infer shape and temperature profile
   unambiguously along the fiber length. This distributed 3D strain and

Abstract = {{The effect of nucleation and plasticization on the stereocomplex
   formation between poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and poly(D-lactic acid)
   (PDLA) was investigated in blends where PDLA is added as a minor phase
   in a major phase of PLLA. The use of small amounts of PDLA is aimed at
   creating a high melting point stereocomplex phase that in turn can serve
   as nucleating agent for the major phase of PLLA. Blends containing 5\%
   PDLA with talc or organic phosphonate as nucleants and polyethylene
   glycol as plasticizer were prepared via melt-blending. Their
   crystallization behavior was investigated through Differential Scanning
   Calorimetiy (DSC) using various thermal histories. Two peculiar
   stereocomplex melting endotherms were found. The peak temperature and
   enthalpy of these two endotherms were correlated to prior isothermal
   crystallization temperature. The different endotherms were also

Abstract = {{The unseating of decks is one of the most prevalent failure modes of
   bridges after earthquake events, as observed in the 2010 Chile
   Earthquake. Damaged bridges in Chile often had skew angles and were
   supported on elastomeric bearings. Similar bridge construction practices
   with decks supported on elastomeric bearings are also common in the
   central and eastern U.S. (CEUS). The seismic displacement demands on
   skewed bridges are more complicated than those on bridges without skew
   angles due to the coupling of translational modes with the rotational
   mode of vibration. The study presented in this article seeks to
   understand the seismic response of skewed bridge decks supported on
   elastomeric bearings. The scope of the study is limited to one- and
   two-span bridges, which constitute a large portion of bridge inventory
   in the CEUS. The vibration modes of skewed bridge decks are derived in
   closed form and the modes are compared when the gaps between the bridge
   deck and the abutment are open and when one of the gaps is closed due to
   seismic excitation. Nonlinear response history analyses are carried out
   to understand the effects of vertical ground motion, skew angles, aspect
   ratios, and different ground motion types on the seismic displacement
   demand in these cases. Amplification factors that approximate the
   increase in the displacement demand due to the skew angle are proposed.}},

Month = {{OCT 2}},
Abstract = {{Identifying microRNA signatures for the different types and subtypes of
   cancer can result in improved detection, characterization and
   understanding of cancer and move us towards more personalized treatment
   strategies. However, using microRNA's differential expression (tumour
   versus normal) to determine these signatures may lead to inaccurate
   predictions and low interpretability because of the noisy nature of
   miRNA expression data. We present a method for the selection of
   biologically active microRNAs using gene expression data and
   microRNA-to-gene interaction network. Our method is based on a linear
   regression with an elastic net regularization. Our simulations show
   that, with our method, the active miRNAs can be detected with high
   accuracy and our approach is robust to high levels of noise and missing
   information. Furthermore, our results on real datasets for glioblastoma
   and prostate cancer are confirmed by microRNA expression measurements.
   Our method leads to the selection of potentially functionally important
   microRNAs. The associations of some of our identified miRNAs with cancer
   mechanisms are already confirmed in other studies (hypoxia related
   hsa-mir-210 and apoptosis-related hsa-mir-296-5p). We have also
   identified additional miRNAs that were not previously studied in the
   context of cancer but are coherently predicted as active by our method
   and may warrant further investigation. The code is available in Matlab
   and R and can be downloaded on

Abstract = {{A three-dimensional multiphase numerical model was used to simulate the
   infiltration and dissolution of a dense nonaqueous phase liquid (DNAPL)
   release in two experimental flow cells containing different
   heterogeneous and well-characterized permeability fields. DNAPL
   infiltration was modeled using Brooks-Corey-Burdine hysteretic
   constitutive relationships. DNAPL dissolution was simulated using a
   rate-limited mass transfer expression with a velocity-dependent mass
   transfer coefficient and a thermodynamically based calculation of
   DNAPL-water interfacial area. The model did not require calibration of
   any parameters. The model predictions were compared to experimental
   measurements of high-resolution DNAPL saturations and effluent
   concentrations. The predicted concentrations were in close agreement
   with measurements for both domains, indicating that important processes
   were effectively captured by the model. DNAPL saturations greatly
   influenced mass transfer rates through their effect on relative
   permeability and velocity. Areas with low DNAPL saturation were
   associated with low interfacial areas, which resulted in reduced mass
   transfer rates and nonequilibrium dissolution. This was captured by the
   thermodynamic interfacial area model, while a geometric model
   overestimated the interfacial areas and the overall mass transfer. This
   study presents the first validation of the thermodynamic dissolution
   model in three dimensions and for high aqueous phase velocities; such
   conditions are typical for remediation operations, especially in
   heterogeneous aquifers. The demonstrated ability to predict DNAPL
   dissolution, only requiring prior characterization of soil properties
   and DNAPL release conditions, represents a significant improvement
   compared to empirical dissolution models and provides an opportunity to
   delineate the relationship between source zone architecture and the
   remediation potential for complex DNAPL source zones.}},

Title = {{Effects of uni- and multimodal cueing on handrail grasping and

Journal = {{ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{407-414}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: It appears that age-related changes in visual attention
   may impair ability to acquire the visuospatial information needed to
   grasp a handrail effectively in response to sudden loss of balance.
   This, in turn, may increase risk of falling. To counter this problem, we
   developed a proximity-triggered cueing system that provides a visual cue
   (flashing lights) and/or verbal cue ({''}attention use the handrail{''})
   to attract attention to the handrail. This study examined the effect of
   handrail cueing on grasping of the rail and associated gaze behavior in
   a large cohort (n = 160) of independent and ambulatory older adults (age
   64-80).
   Methods: The handrail and cueing system was mounted on a large (2 m x 6
   m) motion platform configured to simulate a real-life environment.
   Subjects performed a daily-life task that required walking to the end of
   the platform, which was triggered to perturb balance by moving suddenly
   when they were adjacent to the rail. To prevent adaptation, each subject
   performed only one trial, and a deception was used to ensure that the
   perturbation was truly unexpected. Each subject was assigned to one of
   four cue conditions: visual, verbal, multimodal (visual-plus-verbal) or
   no cue.
   Results: Verbal cueing attracted overt visual attention to the handrail
   and markedly increased proactive grasping (prior to the onset of the
   balance perturbation) particularly when delivered unimodally. Subjects
   were otherwise much more likely to grasp the rail in reaction to the
   perturbation. A possible trend for visual cueing to improve the accuracy
   of these reactions was offset by adverse effects on reaction speed and
   on frequency of proactive grasping.
   Conclusions: The results support the viability of using unimodal verbal
   cueing to reduce fall risk by increasing proactive handrail use.
   Conversely, they do not strongly support use of visual cueing (either
   alone or in combination with verbal cueing) and suggest that it may even
   have adverse effects. Further study is needed to evaluate effects of
   handrail cueing in a wide range of populations and real-life settings.

Abstract = {{Purpose of reviewThe number of patients listed for lung transplantation
   largely exceeds the number of available transplantable organs because of
   both a shortage of organ donors and a low utilization rate of lungs from
   those donors. Two major innovations in recent years include the use of
   lungs from donations after cardiac death (DCD) and the use of ex-vivo
   lung perfusion (EVLP) to assess and improve injured donor lungs.Recent
   findingsDCD lung transplants now account for about 20\% of lung
   transplants in many centres and outcomes after transplantation have been
   excellent with this source of donation. Clinical experience using EVLP
   has shown the method to be well tolerated and allow for reassessment and
   improvement in function from high-risk donor lungs. When these lungs
   were transplanted, low rates of primary graft dysfunction were achieved
   and long-term survival was comparable with standard transplantation.
   Preclinical studies have shown a great potential of EVLP as a platform
   for the delivery of novel therapies to repair injured donor
   lungs.SummaryA significant increase on the number of available lungs for
   transplantation is expected in the coming years with the wider use of
   DCD lungs and with organ-specific ex-vivo treatment strategies.}},

Abstract = {{Zn and Cl have been found in deposits in municipal solid waste (MSW)
   boilers and industrial boilers. This leads to the general belief that
   ZnCl2 may play a role in corrosion of heat-transfer tubes, owing to its
   low melting temperature and high corrosivity. In this study, the thermal
   stability of the compounds ZnCl2, ZnSO4, and ZnO as well as mixtures of
   ZnCl2, and NaCl/KCl was investigated by means of thermogravimetric
   analysis/differential scanning calorimetry (TGA/DSC). The reactions of
   the Zn compounds with SO2/SO3 and HCl were also investigated. The
   results obtained show that ZnCl2 melts at 320 degrees C. Above 400
   degrees C, ZnCl2 vaporizes and is partly oxidized to ZnO. ZnSO4 is
   stable up to 680 degrees C, at which it decomposes and, subsequently,
   forms ZnO above 900 degrees C. ZnO is stable at a much higher
   temperatures but can be chlorinated to ZnCl2 in the presence of HCl at
   temperatures around 300 degrees C. In the presence of a large amount of
   NaCl/KCl, which is typically the case in actual boilers, ZnCl2 reacts
   with NaCl/KCl to form 2NaCl center dot ZnCl2 and 2KCl center dot ZnCl2,
   respectively. These compounds melt at temperatures lower than NaCl and
   KCl but higher than ZnCl2. The findings show the significance of
   understanding the thermal stability of various zinc compounds, how they
   interact with one another, and whether they react with alkali chlorides
   and other compounds in the deposits to assess the role of Zn in deposit
   formation and corrosion in boilers burning Zn-containing fuels.}},

Abstract = {{Fouling of heat-transfer surfaces by fireside deposits can be of
   significant concern in industrial boilers burning poor-quality fuel. It
   is commonly controlled by sootblowers that blast deposits with
   high-pressure supersonic steam or air jets. However, sootblowing is
   expensive, which motivates efforts to fundamentally understand how
   sootblower jets behave and how they interact with heat-exchanger
   geometries and deposits, to guide efforts to improve and optimize
   sootblower use. Here, we report on the development of a computational
   fluid dynamics (CFD) model to predict the flow behavior of sootblower
   jets, work that began with the customization of a research code but has
   more recently led to an implementation using the commercial CFD software
   ANSYS Fluent, which makes the model more accessible to the wider
   engineering community. CFD model results are compared to experimental
   data that we obtained for jet flow within model tube bank geometries,
   which are representative of superheaters and generating banks in
   industrial boilers. The results quantify the deposit removal
   effectiveness of sootblower jets in the different geometries: the
   centerline rate of decay of the jet peak impact pressure as a function
   of the relative position of the sootblower nozzle and tube geometry, the
   strength of the secondary jets that form when a sootblower jet deflects
   off of a tube, and the force imposed on various tube positions in the
   different configurations.}},

Title = {{Should Alberta upgrade oil sands bitumen? An integrated life cycle
   framework to evaluate energy systems investment tradeoffs}},
Journal = {{ENERGY POLICY}},
Year = {{2013}},

Pages = {{78-87}},

Abstract = {{The inclusion of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions costs in energy systems
   investment decision-making requires the development of a framework that
   accounts for GHG and economic tradeoffs. This paper develops such a
   framework by integrating partial cost-benefit analysis with life cycle
   assessment to explore the question of whether bitumen should be upgraded
   in the Canadian province of Alberta to produce synthetic crude oil
   (SCO), or blended with light hydrocarbons to produce lower-quality
   diluted bitumen (dilbit). The net present value (NPV) of these options
   is calculated from the stakeholder perspectives of the oil sands
   industry, the Alberta public, and a climate-concerned Alberta resident.
   This calculation includes monetized GHG emissions costs stemming from a
   hypothetical economy-wide GHG price, and a sensitivity analysis explores
   the effects of variations in technical and economic conditions on
   stakeholders' preferences. We find that under most plausible sets of
   conditions, industry would prefer the dilution option, while the
   climate-concerned Alberta resident would prefer the upgrading option. In
   contrast, the preferences of the general Alberta public depend on the
   values of key variables (e.g., the SCO-dilbit price differential). Key
   drivers of differences among stakeholders' preferences include different
   perceptions of risks and responsibilities for life cycle GHG emissions.

Abstract = {{We present a compact wireless headset for simultaneous multi-site
   neuromonitoring and neurostimulation in the rodent brain. The system
   comprises flexible-shaft microelectrodes, neural amplifiers,
   neurostimulators, a digital time-division multiplexer (TDM), a
   micro-controller and a ZigBee wireless transceiver. The system is built
   by parallelizing up to four 0.35 mu m CMOS integrated circuits (each
   having 256 neural amplifiers and 64 neurostimulators) to provide a total
   maximum of 1024 neural amplifiers and 256 neurostimulators. Each bipolar
   neural amplifier features 54 dB-72 dB adjustable gain, 1 Hz-5 kHz
   adjustable bandwidth with an input-referred noise of 7.99 mu V-rms and
   dissipates 12.9 mu W. Each current-mode bipolar neurostimulator
   generates programmable arbitrary-waveform biphasic current in the range
   of 20-250 mu A and dissipates 2.6 mu W in the stand-by mode.
   Reconfigurability is provided by stacking a set of dedicated mini-PCBs
   that share a common signaling bus within as small as 22 x 30 x 15
   mm(3)volume. The system features flexible polyimide-based microelectrode
   array design that is not brittle and increases pad packing density. Pad
   nanotexturing by electrodeposition reduces the electrode-tissue
   interface impedance from an average of 2 M Omega to 30 k Omega at 100
   Hz. The rodent headset and the microelectrode array have been
   experimentally validated in vivo in freely moving rats for two months.
   We demonstrate 92.8 percent seizure rate reduction by responsive
   neurostimulation in an acute epilepsy rat model.}},

Abstract = {{A spectral-multiplexed fluorescence contact imaging microsystem for DNA
   analysis is presented. The microsystem integrates a filterless CMOS
   Color PhotoGate (CPG) sensor that exploits the polysilicon gate as an
   optical filter, and therefore does not require an external color filter.
   The CPG is applied to fluorescence-based transduction in a spectrally
   multiplexed format by differentiating among multiple emission bands,
   hence replacing the functionality of a bank of emission filters. A
   microsystem has been quantitatively modeled and prototyped based on the
   CPG fabricated in a standard 0.35 mu m CMOS technology. The multi-color
   imaging capability of the microsystem in analyzing DNA targets has been
   validated in the detection of marker gene sequences for spinal muscular
   atropy disease and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Spectral-multiplexing
   enables the two DNA targets to be simultaneously detected with a
   measured detection limits of 240 nM and 210 nM for the two target
   concentrations at a sample volume of 10 mu L for the green and red
   transduction channels, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Photoacoustic (PA) imaging of biological tissues using laser diodes
   instead of conventional Q-switched pulsed systems provides an attractive
   alternative for biomedical applications. However, the relatively low
   energy of laser diodes operating in the pulsed regime, results in
   generation of very weak acoustic waves, and low signal-to-noise ratio
   (SNR) of the detected signals. This problem can be addressed if optical
   excitation is modulated using custom waveforms and correlation
   processing is employed to increase SNR through signal compression. This
   work investigates the effect of the parameters of the modulation
   waveform on the resulting correlation signal and offers a practical
   means for optimizing PA signal detection. The advantage of coherent
   signal averaging is demonstrated using theoretical analysis and a
   numerical model of PA generation. It was shown that an additional 5-10
   dB of SNR can be gained through waveform engineering by adjusting the
   parameters and profile of optical modulation waveforms. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Laboratory measurements of mode-I fracture toughness of Barre granite
   under a wide range of loading rates were carried out with an MTS machine
   and a split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) system using the notched
   semi-circular bend (NSCB) specimen. The fracture toughness anisotropy
   was found to decrease with the increase of the loading rate. A
   micromechanics model is utilized in this work to understand this
   experimental observation, invoking crack-microcrack interactions. Two
   micromechanics models are constructed based on the microstructural
   investigation of Barre granite samples using the thin-section method. In
   both models, the rock material is assumed to be homogenous and
   isotropic. The main crack (i.e., the pre-crack in the NSCB specimen) and
   the closest microcracks are included in the numerical analysis.
   Numerical results show that stress shielding occurs in the model where
   the two microcracks form an acute angel with the main crack and the
   nominal fracture toughness is bigger than the intrinsic one, while
   stress amplification occurs in the model where the microcrack is
   collinear to the main crack and the nominal fracture toughness is
   smaller than the intrinsic one. Assuming that the intrinsic fracture
   toughness of the rock material has the usual loading rate dependency, we
   are able to reproduce the decreasing trend of the fracture toughness
   anisotropy as observed from experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

   journals are Journal of Chemical and Engineering Data, The Journal of
   Chemical Thermodynamics, Fluid Phase Equilibria, Thermochimica Acta, and
   International Journal of Thermophysics. The history of this unique
   cooperation is outlined, together with an overview of software tools and
   procedures that have been developed and implemented to aid authors,
   editors, and reviewers at all stages of the publication process,
   including experiment planning. Both successes and failures are
   highlighted. The procedures are now well established and are designed to
   yield maximum benefit to all stakeholders (authors, editors, reviewers,
   publishers, readers, data users, etc.) through the establishment of
   procedures and support tools that efficiently serve the specific
   interests of those involved. All specially designed tools and procedures
   are described fully, together with their benefits and examples of
   application. A key feature of the cooperation is the efficient
   validation of experimental data after peer review but before acceptance
   for publication. Nearly 1000 articles per year are considered within the
   scope of this work, with significant problems identified in roughly
   one-third of these. Full statistics for the findings are given, and a
   variety of examples of common problems found are given.}},

Abstract = {{Bone remodeling is achieved through the resorptive activity of
   osteoclasts and the synthetic activity of osteoblast and it continues
   throughout life. Cement lines are formed by osteoblasts and are
   recognized between old and new bone. However, the detailed structure of
   cement lines has still not been clarified. The present study researched
   the ultrastructure of cement lines in a ferret femur using light
   microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning
   electron microscopy (SEM). On LM, many resorption tunnels were
   recognized in cortical bones. Some osteoclasts in Howship's lacunae were
   observed at the top of the resorption tunnel (cutting cone), and
   osteoblasts forming some layers were recognized behind osteoclasts
   (filling cone). The layer of osteoid was observed under osteoblasts, and
   it was slightly eosinophilic on the decalcified specimen. A very thin
   layer of cement lines was recognized between osteoid and old bone, and
   it was slightly basophilic on hematoxylin and eosin (HE). On the
   non-decalcified sections stained with toluidine blue (TB), cement lines
   showed anochromasia in the non-etched specimen, but stained with TB in
   the etched one. On TEM, cement lines were recognized between osteoid and
   old bone, and they were revealed as extracellular matrices of an
   afibrillar layer, with a thickness of about 2 mu m. On BSE analysis,
   cement lines of osteon were observed as 1- 2 mu m white lines.
   Conclusively, the present study indicated that cement lines are
   extracellular matrices of hypercalcified afibrillar layer having 2 mu m
   thickness.}},

   Behavior}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MECHANICAL DESIGN}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{135}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{We developed an affordance-based methodology to support environmentally
   conscious behavior (ECB) that conserves resources such as materials,
   energy, etc. While studying concepts that aim to support ECB, we noted
   that characteristics of products that enable ECB tend to be more
   accurately described as affordances than functions. Therefore, we became
   interested in affordances, and specifically how affordances can be used
   to design products that support ECB. Affordances have been described as
   possible ways of interacting with products, or context-dependent
   relations between artifacts and users. Other researchers have explored
   affordances in lieu of functions as a basis for design, and developed
   detailed deductive methods of discovering affordances in products. We
   abstracted desired affordances from patterns and principles we observed
   to support ECB, and generated concepts based on those affordances. As a
   possible shortcut to identifying and implementing relevant affordances,
   we introduced the affordance-transfer method. This method involves
   altering a product's affordances to add desired features from related
   products. Promising sources of affordances include lead-user and other
   products that support resource conservation. We performed initial
   validation of the affordance-transfer method and observed that it can
   improve the usefulness of the concepts that novice designers generate to
   support ECB.}},

   transport}},
Journal = {{NATURE COMMUNICATIONS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{4}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Nanomaterials are used for numerous biomedical applications, but the
   selection of optimal properties for maximum delivery remains
   challenging. Thus, there is a significant interest in elucidating the
   nano-bio interactions underlying tissue accumulation. To date,
   researchers have relied on cell culture or animal models to study
   nano-bio interactions. However, cell cultures lack the complexity of
   biological tissues and animal models are prohibitively slow and
   expensive. Here we report a tumour-on-a-chip system where incorporation
   of tumour-like spheroids into a microfluidic channel permits real-time
   analysis of nanoparticle (NP) accumulation at physiological flow
   conditions. We show that penetration of NPs into the tissue is limited
   by their diameter and that retention can be improved by receptor
   targeting. NP transport is predominantly diffusion-limited with
   convection improving accumulation mostly at the tissue perimeter. A
   murine tumour model confirms these findings and demonstrates that the
   tumour-on-a-chip can be useful for screening optimal NP designs prior to
   in vivo studies.}},

Title = {{Numerical simulation of acoustic emission in brittle rocks by
   two-dimensional finite-discrete element analysis}},
Journal = {{GEOPHYSICAL JOURNAL INTERNATIONAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{195}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{423-443}},

Abstract = {{Stress waves, known as acoustic emissions (AEs), are released by
   localized inelastic deformation events during the progressive failure of
   brittle rocks. Although several numerical models have been developed to
   simulate the deformation and damage processes of rocks, such as
   non-linear stress-strain behaviour and localization of failure, only a
   limited number have been capable of providing quantitative information
   regarding the associated seismicity. Moreover, the majority of these
   studies have adopted a pseudo-static approach based on elastic strain
   energy dissipation that completely disregards elastodynamic effects.
   This paper describes a new AE modelling technique based on the combined
   finite-discrete element method (FEM/DEM), a numerical tool that
   simulates material failure by explicitly considering fracture nucleation
   and propagation in the modelling domain. Given the explicit time
   integration scheme of the solver, stress wave propagation and the effect
   of radiated seismic energy can be directly captured. Quasi-dynamic
   seismic information is extracted from a FEM/DEM model with a newly
   developed algorithm based on the monitoring of internal variables (e.g.
   relative displacements and kinetic energy) in proximity to propagating
   cracks. The AE of a wing crack propagation model based on this algorithm
   are cross-analysed by traveltime inversion and energy estimation from
   seismic recordings. Results indicate a good correlation of AE initiation
   times and locations, and scaling of energies, independently calculated
   with the two methods. Finally, the modelling technique is validated by
   simulating a laboratory compression test on a granite sample. The
   micromechanical parameters of the heterogeneous model are first
   calibrated to reproduce the macroscopic stress-strain response measured
   during standard laboratory tests. Subsequently, AE frequency-magnitude
   statistics, spatial clustering of source locations and the evolution of
   AE rate are investigated. The distribution of event magnitude tends to
   decay as power law while the spatial distribution of sources exhibits a
   fractal character, in agreement with experimental observations.
   Moreover, the model can capture the decrease of seismic b value
   associated with the macrorupture of the rock sample and the transition
   of AE spatial distribution from diffuse, in the pre-peak stage, to
   strongly localized at the peak and post-peak stages, as reported in a
   number of published laboratory studies. In future studies, the validated
   FEM/DEM-AE modelling technique will be used to obtain further insights
   into the micromechanics of rock failure with potential applications
   ranging from laboratory-scale microcracking to engineering-scale
   processes (e.g. excavations within mines, tunnels and caverns, petroleum
   and geothermal reservoirs) to tectonic earthquakes triggering.}},

Abstract = {{This brief describes the design of a monolithic plastic optical fiber
   (POF) receiver with a pair of 250-by-250 mu m N-well/P-sub
   photodetectors (PDs). A two-stage continuous-time linear equalizer that
   utilizes multiple active shunt-shunt feedback networks has been proposed
   to compensate for the slow-rolling-off high-frequency losses of the PDs.
   A test chip has been implemented in a standard 65-nm CMOS process, and
   it consists of a transimpedance amplifier, a variable-gain amplifier, a
   linear equalizer, a limiting amplifier, and an output buffer. The
   receiver consumes an active chip area of 0.24 mm(2) and a dc power of 46
   mW (excluding auxiliary test circuits and the output buffer) from a 1-V
   power supply. The prototype POF receiver demonstrates a
   non-return-to-zero data rate of 4 Gbit/s with a bit error rate less than
   10(-12), at a peak-to-peak optical input power of -3.2 dBm p-p (average
   input power is kept at -3 dBm).}},

Abstract = {{The phenomenon of white mist in a rapidly filling pipeline containing an
   entrapped air pocket is numerically and experimentally investigated. The
   air-water flow patterns, pressure, and temperature histories are
   synchronously recorded to illustrate their interrelations. The white
   mist phenomenon is particularly observed during fast transients,
   especially during the first compression of the air pocket. Comparisons
   between calculations and experiments indicate that the white mist
   primarily reflects a condensation process. More specifically, the air
   temperature increases because of rapid compression of an entrapped air
   pocket, and the high temperature could cause water to adhere to vapor at
   the pipe surface. For fast transients, the first compression causes a
   near-adiabatic air compression, but heat exchange effects become more
   significant in the subsequent compression and expansion cycles. As the
   initial air length decreases, the maximum pressure first increases and
   then declines, with the most dangerous air length occurring when about
   3.4\% is initially occupied by air. The ratio of the maximum pressure to
   the driving pressure increases approximately linearly with respect to
   the upstream pressure. A local-interpolation elastic-water model is
   developed by considering air-temperature change and its validity is
   confirmed by comparing the model and experimental results.}},

Abstract = {{Few three-dimensional (3-D) models exist to study the cellular aspects
   and molecular regulation of orthodontic tooth movement (OTM). The aim of
   this study was to develop a 3-D in vitro model to study mechanical
   loading of human periodontal ligament (PDL) fibroblasts (hPDLF). hPDLF
   were seeded within collagen gels to form a PDLF analogue.
   Characterisation of the seeded collagen gels revealed that the gels
   supported cell proliferation, viability and the emergence of a possible
   contractile phenotype, replicating the constrained condition of the
   human PDL in vivo. We next developed a 3-D model that incorporated a
   seeded collagen gel interlocked mechanically at two ends to movable end
   plates. The movable end plates allowed for static tensile or compressive
   loading of the hPDLF-seeded collagen gels. Preliminary testings showed
   that this 3-D model mimicked PDL strains similar to those observed
   during OTM. Our 3-D model of OTM therefore offers promise for use as a
   model system in future studies to improve our understanding of the
   effects of OTM on PDLF. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a two-part study with walking conditions involving
   music and television (TV) to investigate their effects on human gait. In
   the first part, we observed seventeen able-bodied adults as they
   participated in three 15-minute walking trials: (1) without music, (2)
   with music and (3) without music again. In the second part, we observed
   fifteen able-bodied adults as they walked on a treadmill for 15 min
   while watching (1) TV with sound (2) TV without sound and (3) TV with
   subtitles but no sound. Gait timing was recorded via bilateral heel
   sensors and center-of-mass accelerations were measured by tri-axial
   accelerometers. Measures of statistical persistence, dynamic stability
   and gait variability were calculated. Our results showed that none of
   the considered gait measures were statistically different when comparing
   music with no-music trials. Therefore, walking to music did not appear
   to affect intrinsic walking dynamics in the able-bodied adult
   population. However, stride interval variability and stride interval
   dynamics were significantly greater in the TV with sound walking
   condition when compared to the TV with subtitles condition. Treadmill
   walking while watching TV with subtitles alters intrinsic gait dynamics
   but potentially offers greater gait stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Using the city of Toronto as a case study, this article examines impacts
   of energy stocks and flexible demand in the urban metabolism on the
   resilience of the city, including discussion of directions for further
   study of the resiliency of the urban metabolism. An important element
   developed is the nominal residence time of the energy stocks. This value
   defines how long an energy stock lasts under typical patterns of energy
   use. The findings suggest that the residence times of many sources of
   energy overcome vulnerability when energy supply shocks last on the
   order of hours or a few days, but that the measure is limited to
   assessing only certain types of commonly used energy sources in
   aggregate terms. Discussion is included on the uncertainty of this
   measure and on the metabolic and resiliency implications of new
   technologies intended to reduce energy use and improve sustainability of
   cities and the use of the urban metabolism as a means of comparison. The
   methodology employed highlights how waste energy could be used to
   increase the resiliency of the city's water supply, but also how the
   study of the urban metabolism would benefit from a more disaggregate
   form in the study of sustainable and resilient cities.}},

Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Recent advances in preclinical radiotherapy systems have
   provided the foundation for scaling many of the elements of clinical
   radiation therapy practice to the dimensions and energy demanded in
   small animal studies. Such systems support the technical capabilities to
   accurately deliver highly complex dose distributions, but methods to
   optimize and deliver such distributions remain in their infancy. This
   study developed an optimization method based on empirically measured
   two-dimensional dose kernel measurements to deliver arbitrary planar
   dose distributions on a recently developed small animal radiotherapy
   platform.
   Methods: A two-dimensional dose kernel was measured with repeated
   radiochromic film measurements for the circular 1 mm diameter fixed
   collimator of the small animal radiotherapy system at 1 cm depth in a
   solid water phantom. This kernel was utilized in a sequential quadratic
   programming optimization framework to determine optimal beam positions
   and weights to deliver an arbitrary desired dose distribution. The
   positions and weights were then translated to a set of stage motions to
   automatically deliver the optimized dose distribution. End-to-end
   efficacy of the framework was quantified through five repeated
   deliveries of two dosimetric challenges: (1) a 5 mm radius bullseye
   distribution, and (2) a ``sock{''} distribution contained within a 9 x
   13 mm bounding box incorporating rectangular, semicircular, and
   exponentially decaying geometric constructs and a rectangular linear
   dose gradient region. These two challenges were designed to gauge
   targeting, geometric, and dosimetric fidelity.
   Results: Optimization of the bullseye and sock distributions required
   2.1 and 5.9 min and utilized 50 and 77 individual beams for delivery,
   respectively. Automated delivery of the resulting optimized
   distributions, validated using radiochromic film measurements, revealed
   an average targeting accuracy of 0.32 mm, and a dosimetric delivery
   error along four line profiles taken through the sock distribution of
   3.9\%. Mean absolute delivery error across the 0-1 Gy linear dose
   gradient over 7.5 mm was 0.01 Gy.
   Conclusions: The work presented here demonstrates the potential for
   complex dose distributions to be planned and automatically delivered
   with millimeter scale heterogeneity at submillimeter accuracy. This
   capability establishes the technical foundation for preclinical
   validation of biologically guided radiotherapy investigations and
   development of unique radiobiological experiments. (c) 2013 American

Abstract = {{Whitening the testing of service-oriented applications can provide
   service consumers confidence on how well an application has been tested.
   However, to protect business interests of service providers and to
   prevent information leakage, the implementation details of services are
   usually invisible to service consumers. This makes it challenging to
   determine the test coverage of a service composition as a whole and
   design test cases effectively. To address this problem, we propose an
   approach to whiten the testing of service compositions based on events
   exposed by services. By deriving event interfaces to explore only
   necessary test coverage information from service implementations, our
   approach allows service consumers to determine test coverage based on
   selected events exposed by services at runtime without releasing the
   service implementation details. We also develop an approach to design
   test cases effectively based on event interfaces concerning both
   effectiveness and information leakage. The experimental results show
   that our approach outperforms existing testing approaches for service
   compositions with up to 49 percent more test coverage and an up to 24
   percent higher fault-detection rate. Moreover, our solution can trade
   off effectiveness, efficiency, and information leakage for test case
   generation.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{46}},
Pages = {{74-84}},

Abstract = {{The quality of an adhesive-adherend combination is often judged by
   whether the failure surface or crack path is cohesive or interfacial.
   The relationship between crack path and test method was examined by
   comparing the performance of individual adhesive-adherend combinations
   (six) in quasi-static fracture, mixed-mode fatigue to the threshold, and
   creep crack growth. In mixed-mode loading, crack paths in creep were
   similar to those in quasi-static fracture even though the crack growth
   rates in creep were much smaller. This was attributed to similar
   crack-tip plastic zone sizes in the toughened epoxy adhesive during
   creep and quasi-static fracture. Both creep and threshold fatigue tests
   produced interfacial failure when the test environment created condensed
   moisture at the crack tip and the loading was mixed-mode. Interfacial
   failure was also evident in room-temperature dry environments in
   mixed-mode fatigue at slow crack growth rates near the threshold, but
   was not seen in either creep or quasi-static fracture under mixed-mode
   loading in dry air. This increased sensitivity of near-threshold,
   mixed-mode fatigue to surface properties was caused by the proximity of
   the crack path to the interface as a result of a smaller plastic zone
   size. Therefore, the interfacial or cohesive failure of an adhesive
   system can be a function of the test being conducted and may not be an
   absolute indicator of joint quality. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Optimization of transient liquid phase (TLP)-bonding variables is
   essential to achieve a joint free from deleterious intermetallic
   constituents and with appropriate mechanical properties. In this study,
   TLP bonding of IN-738LC superalloy was performed using AMS 4777 filler
   metal. The influence of gap size and bonding parameters (temperature and
   time) was investigated on the joint microstructure and its properties.
   In cases where the holding time was insufficient for complete isothermal
   solidification, the residual liquid transformed to non-equilibrium
   eutectic microconstituents consisting of nickel-rich boride,
   chromium-rich boride, and gamma solid solution phases. The eutectic
   width decreased with the increase of holding time and the increase in
   initial gap size resulted in thicker eutectic width in the samples
   bonded at the same temperature and for equivalent holding times. The
   time of complete isothermal solidification decreased with the increase
   in bonding temperature to 1100A degrees C, which was consistent with the
   models based on the diffusion-induced solid/liquid interface motion.
   Microhardness and shear strength tests were used to investigate the
   mechanical properties of the bonds. In the bonding condition in which
   isothermal solidification was not accomplished completely, the eutectic
   constituent with the highest hardness in the bond region was the
   preferential failure source. The results showed that homogenized joints
   had the highest shear strength. (C) The Minerals, Metals \& Materials

Abstract = {{Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by mutations in
   the X-linked gene encoding methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2).
   Spontaneous recurrent discharge episodes are displayed in Rett-related
   seizures as in other types of epilepsies. The aim of this paper is to
   investigate the seizure-like event (SLE) and inter-SLE states in a
   female MeCP2-deficient mouse model of Rett syndrome and compare them to
   those found in other spontaneous recurrent epilepsy models. The study
   was performed on a small population of female MeCP2-deficient mice using
   telemetric local field potential (LFP) recordings over a 24 h period.
   Durations of SLEs and inter-SLEs were extracted using a rule-based
   autornated SLE detection system for both daytime and nighttime, as well
   as high and low power levels of the delta frequency range (0.5-4 Hz) of
   the recorded LFPs. The results suggest SLE occurrences are not
   influenced by circadian rhythms, but had a significantly greater
   association with delta power. Investigating inter-SLE and SLE states by
   fitting duration histograms to the gamma distribution showed that SLE
   initiation and termination were associated with random and deterministic
   mechanisms, respectively. These findings when compared to reported
   studies on epilepsy suggest that Rett-related seizures share many
   similarities with absence epilepsy. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published

Abstract = {{The cement industry and concrete producers are under pressure to reduce
   the carbon footprint and energy demands of cement-based construction
   materials. This study investigates the CO2 uptake of paste mixtures
   designed with general use (GU) Portland cement, ground granulated blast
   furnace slag (GGBFS) and reactive MgO as cement replacement due to
   exposure to an accelerated carbonation curing regime with 99.9\%
   concentration of CO2. The CO2 uptake, carbonation mechanism,
   microstructure and microhardness of cement pastes are examined. Key
   outcomes revealed that: (i) samples exposed to accelerated carbonation
   curing exhibit a denser microstructure and higher microhardness in
   comparison to non-carbonated samples, (ii) irrespective of the presence
   of reactive MgO, CO2 uptake increases with age from 7 to 56 d, (iii) by
   56 d, pastes containing 10\% and 20\% reactive MgO uptake similar
   amounts of CO2 in comparison to mixtures without reactive MgO, and (iv)
   pastes containing 40\% reactive MgO uptake the least amount of CO2
   however, exhibit the greatest microhardness and the lowest porosity. (C)

Abstract = {{This paper studies an uplink multicell joint processing model in which
   the base-stations are connected to a centralized processing server via
   rate-limited digital backhaul links. We propose a simple scheme that
   performs Wyner-Ziv compress-and-forward relaying on a per-base-station
   basis followed by successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the
   central processor. The proposed scheme has a significantly reduced
   complexity as compared to joint decoding, resulting in an easily
   computable achievable rate region. Although suboptimal in general, this
   paper shows that the proposed per-base-station SIC scheme can achieve
   the sum capacity of a class of Wyner cellular model to within a constant
   gap. This paper also establishes that in order to achieve to within a
   constant gap to the maximum SIC rate with infinite backhaul, the
   limited-backhaul system must have backhaul capacities that scale
   logarithmically with the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios (SINRs)
   at the base-stations. Further, this paper studies the optimal backhaul
   rate allocation problem for the per-base-station SIC model with a total
   backhaul capacity constraint, and shows that the sum-rate maximizing
   allocation should also have individual backhaul rates that scale
   logarithmically with the SINR at each base-station. Finally, the
   proposed per-base-station SIC scheme is evaluated in a practical
   multicell network to quantify the performance gain brought by multicell
   processing.}},

Abstract = {{This paper proposes an efficient two-stage channel quantization and
   feedback scheme for the downlink limited-feedback network multiple-input
   multiple-output (MIMO) system. In the first stage, the users report
   their best set of base-station antenna and physical resource block
   combinations, and the base-stations schedule the best user for each
   antenna in each resource block. The scheduled users are then polled in
   the second stage to feedback their quantized channel vectors. This paper
   proposes an analytical framework to show that, under a total feedback
   budget of B bits, the number of bits assigned to the second feedback
   stage should scale as log B, and in quantizing channel vectors from
   different base-stations, each user should allocate feedback bits in
   proportion to the channel magnitudes in dB scale. Under these optimized
   bit allocations, the overall sum rate of the system is shown to scale
   double-logarithmically with B, linearly with the total number of
   antennas, and logarithmically with transmit power, thus achieving both
   multiuser diversity and spatial multiplexing gains under limited
   feedback. Finally, realistic wireless propagation model of an urban
   small-cell deployment is used to show that the proposed scheme can
   approach the performance of a network MIMO system with full channel
   state information with only modest amount of channel feedback.}},

Abstract = {{Functional verification has become one of the most time-consuming tasks
   in the very large scale integration design flow accounting for up to
   57\% of the total project time. The largest component of this task is
   that of design debugging due to its resource-intensive manual nature.
   With the ever growing size of modern designs and their error traces, the
   complexity of the debugging problem poses a great challenge to automated
   debugging techniques. To overcome this challenge, this paper introduces
   a novel path-directed abstraction and refinement algorithm for design
   debugging to manage excessive error trace lengths. A sliding window of
   the error trace is iteratively analyzed in a time-windowing framework,
   which is made possible by the use of the path-directed abstraction. This
   abstraction forms a concise approximation of nonmodeled parts of the
   error trace while simultaneously providing an efficient representation
   for refinement. The result is an algorithm that dramatically reduces the
   memory requirements of debugging while mitigating the incomplete results
   of past techniques. Experimental results on industrial designs with long
   error traces show that the proposed approach can analyze traces that are
   64.6\% longer while simultaneously decreasing peak memory usage compared
   to previous work.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we investigate the problem of optimal content cache
   management for HTTP adaptive bit rate (ABR) streaming over wireless
   networks. Specifically, in the media cloud, each content is transcoded
   into a set of media files with diverse playback rates, and appropriate
   files will be dynamically chosen in response to channel conditions and
   screen forms. Our design objective is to maximize the quality of
   experience (QoE) of an individual content for the end users, under a
   limited storage budget. Deriving a logarithmic QoE model from our
   experimental results, we formulate the individual content cache
   management for HTTP ABR streaming over wireless network as a constrained
   convex optimization problem. We adopt a two-step process to solve the
   snapshot problem. First, using the Lagrange multiplier method, we obtain
   the numerical solution of the set of playback rates for a fixed number
   of cache copies and characterize the optimal solution analytically. Our
   investigation reveals a fundamental phase change in the optimal solution
   as the number of cached files increases. Second, we develop three
   alternative search algorithms to find the optimal number of cached
   files, and compare their scalability under average and worst complexity
   metrics. Our numerical results suggest that, under optimal cache
   schemes, the maximum QoE measurement, i.e., mean-opinion-score (MOS), is
   a concave function of the allowable storage size. Our cache management
   can provide high expected QoE with low complexity, shedding light on the
   design of HTTP ABR streaming services over wireless networks.}},

Abstract = {{The validity of thermodynamics at the nanoscale has been questioned, but
   we demonstrate that it can be applied to determine surface properties of
   a nonporous and of a mesoporous silica from the measured adsorption
   isotherms of three hydrocarbon vapors. These measurements give the total
   amount of vapor adsorbed and liquid formed in the pores as a function of
   pressure. We compare these measurements with the thermodynamic
   predictions when the pressure dependence of the contact angle inside the
   pore is taken into account and determine the values of the surface
   properties by requiring the thermodynamically predicted isotherms to
   have the same pressure dependence as the measurements. We assess the
   procedure by considering the consistency of the property values obtained
   with each of the three vapors, and find the properties differ by only a
   few percent. This consistency indicates that thermodynamics is valid at
   least in pores down to a radius of 1.3 nm. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{An indoor tracking and navigation system based on measurements of
   received signal strength (RSS) in wireless local area network (WLAN) is
   proposed. In the system, the location determination problem is solved by
   first applying a proximity constraint to limit the distance between a
   coarse estimate of the current position and a previous estimate. Then, a
   Compressive Sensing-based (CS-based) positioning scheme, proposed in our
   previous work {[}1], {[}2], is applied to obtain a refined position
   estimate. The refined estimate is used with a map-adaptive Kalman
   filter, which assumes a linear motion between intersections on a map
   that describes the user's path, to obtain a more robust position
   estimate. Experimental results with the system that is implemented on a
   PDA with limited resources (HP iPAQ hx2750 PDA) show that the proposed
   tracking system outperforms the widely used traditional positioning and
   tracking systems. Meanwhile, the tracking system leads to 12.6 percent
   reduction in the mean position error compared to the CS-based stationary
   positioning system when three APs are used. A navigation module that is
   integrated with the tracking system provides users with instructions to
   guide them to predefined destinations. Thirty visually impaired subjects
   from the Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB) were invited
   to further evaluate the performance of the navigation system. Testing
   results suggest that the proposed system can be used to guide visually
   impaired subjects to their desired destinations.}},

Abstract = {{Direct correlation of molecular conformation with local structure is
   critical to studies of protein- and peptide-membrane interactions,
   particularly in the context of membrane-facilitated aggregation, and
   disruption or disordering. Infrared spectroscopy has long been a
   mainstay for determining molecular conformation, following folding
   dynamics, and characterizing reactions. While tremendous advances have
   been made in improving the spectral and temporal resolution of infrared
   spectroscopy, it has only been with the introduction of scanned-probe
   techniques that exploit the raster-scanning tip as either a source,
   scattering tool, or measurement probe that researchers have been able to
   obtain sub-diffraction limit IR spectra. This review will examine the
   history of correlated scanned-probe IR spectroscopies, from their
   inception to their use in studies of molecular aggregates, membrane
   domains, and cellular structures. The challenges and opportunities that
   these platforms present for examining dynamic phenomena will be
   discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: FTIR in

Abstract = {{Micro-finite element (FE) modeling has shown promise in evaluating the
   structural integrity of trabecular bone. Histologic microcrack analyses
   have been compared to FE models of trabecular bone cores to demonstrate
   the potential of this technique. To date this has not been achieved in
   whole bone structures, and comparisons of histologic microcrack and FE
   results have been limited due to challenges in alignment of 2D sections
   with 3D data sets. The goal of this study was to ascertain if image
   registration can facilitate determination of a relationship between
   stresses and strains generated from FE models of whole vertebrae and
   histologically identified microdamage. FE models of three whole
   vertebrae, stained sequentially with calcein and fuchsin, were generated
   with accurate integration of element sets representing the histologic
   sections based on volumetric image registration. Displacement boundary
   conditions were applied to the FE models based on registration of loaded
   and unloaded CT images. Histologically labeled damaged regions were
   found to have significantly higher von Mises stresses and principle
   strains in the FE models, as compared to undamaged regions. This work
   provides a new robust method for generating and histologically
   validating FE models of whole bones that can represent trabecular damage
   resulting from complex physiologic loading. (c) 2013 Orthopaedic

   tank, is identified. The inlet jets are found to flow along the walls of
   the tank and impinge on each other at the top of the tank. This
   impingement point is located more towards the right side of the tank.
   The temperature contours along the length of the tank have a saddle
   shape, with high temperatures towards the edges of the saddle. The

Abstract = {{An experimental study is performed to investigate the evolution of soot
   morphology in an atmospheric pressure laminar coflow diffusion flame of
   a three-component surrogate for Jet A-1. The laser extinction
   measurement method and the rapid thermocouple insertion technique are
   used to obtain soot volume fraction profiles and temperature profiles,
   respectively. Thermophoretic sampling followed by transmission electron
   microscopy and atomic force microscopy is used to study the morphology
   of soot particles at different locations inside the flame. Soot
   formation on the centerline appears to be different from conventional
   models. Liquid-like particles, which are transparent at the wavelength
   of 623 nm, are formed and grow up to a volume equivalent diameter of
   d(p) = 60 nm at temperatures below T = 1500 K. When the temperature
   exceeds 1500 K, transition of the transparent particles to the mature
   agglomerated particles happens immediately, i.e. in less than 12 ms. The
   volume of the liquid-like particles just before the start of their
   transformation to solid is about five times larger than the volume of
   mature primary particles. This significant size difference suggests that
   a large liquid-like particle does not transform into a single primary
   particle. In addition, multiple dark nuclei are observed in the
   liquid-like particles prior to carbonization. The significant size
   discrepancy and the presence of multiple dark nuclei may indicate that
   primary particle formation and agglomeration on the centerline happen
   inside the liquid-like particles. In contrast to the centerline, on
   another streamline with a significantly different temperature history,
   soot particles form from relatively small liquid-like particles. These
   particles have the same size as mature primary particles. Carbonization
   happens early on the streamline. A single dark nucleus grows inside each
   liquid-like particle and primary particles agglomerate after
   carbonization is completed. Most of the currently used computational
   soot models consider a single evolution process for all of the
   streamlines inside the flame which may not be an accurate assumption.
   This study shows that soot evolution processes may be different across
   the flame and are a function of temperature and the concentration of
   specific species inside the flame. (C) 2013 The Combustion Institute.

Abstract = {{The world of biosensors is expanding at a rapid pace with an
   ever-increasing demand for more sensitive miniaturized devices. Acoustic
   wave biosensors are not spared from this trend. In this domain, the
   search for enhanced sensitivity is increasingly oriented toward the
   rational design of new piezoelectric materials with superior properties
   to substitute for prevalent quartz. With respect to surface chemistry,
   construction of the biorecognition element, more often than not,
   requires the use of bifunctional molecules that can spontaneously
   assemble on the substrate and form organic surfaces readily
   biofunctionalizable in a subsequent, ideally single step. In this
   context, we present herein the surface modification of aluminum nitride
   (AlN) with alkyltrichlorosilane cross-linking molecules bearing a
   functionalizable benzenethiosulfonate moiety. This latter feature is
   next demonstrated through the straightforward, preactivation-free
   immobilization of thiolated biotin probes. To date, AlN has only
   received little attention in the field of piezoelectric biosensors
   despite its many attractive properties and the perspective to operate
   devices at ultra-high frequencies (GHz) with unprecedented sensitivity.
   To our knowledge, this work describes one of the first examples of
   direct surface derivatization of AlN with bifunctional trichlorosilane
   molecules. It also constitutes a first step toward the development of
   electrodeless GHz piezoelectric biosensing platforms based on AlN and
   trichlorosilane surface chemistry. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Nanocrystalline Ni and Ni-Fe alloys produced by electrodeposition were
   characterized using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy
   (HR-TEM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The grain sizes for these
   materials spanned a range of about 81-10 nm. HR-TEM analysis on a series
   of images revealed the presence of local strains at both high-angle and
   low-angle grain boundaries and twin boundaries. In addition to this,
   stacking faults and twins of the growth type (growth faults) were
   observed in both the nanocrystalline Ni and Ni-Fe alloys. The growth
   fault density increased with increasing Fe concentration, which is
   consistent with a decrease in the stacking fault energy. The microstrain
   for the samples was determined from XRD pattern analysis based on line
   broadening. A general increasing microstrain trend with decreasing grain
   size was observed and considered to be related to the local strains
   observed at grain boundaries in the HR-TEM image analysis. With respect
   to grain size, the microstrain values for the nanocrystalline Ni-Fe
   samples were noticeably higher than some of the Ni samples. Further XRD
   pattern analysis was performed to determine the growth fault
   probabilities for each of the samples and analyze their influence on the
   microstrain. Increasing Fe was accompanied by an increase in growth
   fault probability, which was consistent with the HR-TEM image analysis.
   In addition to the effect of grain size, there is likely a contributing
   effect on microstrain-induced XRD line broadening due to the presence of
   growth faults.}},

Abstract = {{Abrasive slurry jet micro-machining (ASJM) uses a well-defined jet of
   abrasive slurry to erode features in a solid target. Compared with
   abrasive water jet machining (AWJM), the present ASJM system operates at
   pressures that are roughly two orders of magnitude lower and uses a
   premixed slurry of relatively low concentration. The objective of the
   present study was to gain a better understanding of the mechanics of
   erosion in ASJM by comparing its performance in the micro-machining of
   holes and channels in borosilicate glass with that of abrasive air jet
   micro-machining (AJM), a process that is simpler and relatively well
   understood. A new ASJM system was developed and used to machine blind
   holes and smooth channels of relatively uniform depth that did not
   suffer from the significant waviness previously reported in the
   literature. The effect of particle velocity, particle concentration, jet
   traverse speed and jet impact angle were examined. A direct comparison
   of ASJM and AJM results was possible since novel measurements of the
   crushing strength of the aluminum oxide abrasive particles used in both
   experiments proved to be unaffected by water. Brittle erosion was shown
   to be the dominant material removal mechanism in both ASJM and AJM in
   spite of the significant flow-induced decrease in the local impact
   angles of many of the particles in ASJM. A new model of the rapid
   particle deceleration near the target surface helped explain the much
   smaller erosion rates of ASJM compared with those in AJM. The modeling
   of the erosion process during the micro-machining of channels showed
   that the effect of the local impact angle at the leading edge of the
   advancing jet was much more significant in ASJM than in AJM, primarily
   due to the narrower focus of the jet impact zone in ASJM. The
   differences in the water and air flow fields and associated particle
   trajectories were used to explain the steeper side walls and flatter
   bottoms of the holes and channels machined with unmasked ASJM compared
   to those with masked AJM. The respective structures of the water and air
   jets also explained the much sharper definition of the edges of these
   features using ASJM compared with maskless AJM. The results of the study
   show that ASJM can be used to accurately micro-machine channels and
   holes with a width of 350-500 mu m and an aspect ratio of 0.5-1.3
   without the use of masks. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Tongue-movement ear pressure (TMEP) signals provide an unobtrusive,
   completely non-invasive, wearable and assistive human-machine interface
   (HMI). The HMI concept is based on monitoring volitional bioacoustic
   activity generated through prescribed tongue motions. In this paper, a
   heterogeneous decoding framework is presented, enabling effective
   real-time polychotomous classification between the various tongue
   actions and dichotomous discrimination of unintended bioacoustic
   activity from the volitional signals. Using this customised framework
   and developed software, the real-time performance was evaluated for both
   three (six subjects) and four action (four subjects) discrimination,
   using healthy subjects. Ignoring false negative rejections, the system
   achieved sensitivities of >90\% for three-action discrimination and
   >80\% for four action discrimination, across all tested subjects. The
   interference rejection (IR) capabilities of the framework were also
   fully demonstrated, using challenging offline data sets. This included a
   subset of low frequency interference signals with similar temporal
   characteristics and frequency distributions as the volitional tongue
   activity. The IR subsystem achieved an average specificity of 76.2\%
   during three-action discrimination and 79.9\% during four-action
   discrimination. To highlight the potential of the system for
   substituting or augmenting existing assistive interfaces, a case study
   is presented demonstrating the utility of TMEP signals for hand
   prosthesis control. Full tongue control was evaluated against three
   alternative control strategies, namely natural human-hand manipulation,
   proportional-based control and a hybrid strategy, when performing an
   everyday object manipulation task. In all cases, the task was completed
   with the hybrid strategy performing comparably and even outperforming
   the proportional-based control strategy. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{This study examines the environmental and economic feasibility of
   concrete noise barriers containing photocatalytic cement using a
   life-cycle cost analysis (LCCA). Photocatalytic concrete contains
   titanium dioxide (TiO2) which allows for the oxidation of air pollutants
   to occur on the surface of the building material. Design variables
   studied include the cementing material type (general use (GU) cement,
   ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) used as cement replacement,
   and photocatalytic (PCAT) cement), and the thickness of a photocatalytic
   concrete cover. The LCCA accounts for the CO2 and NOx generated during
   manufacturing and the NOx (NO, NO2) oxidised during the life of barriers
   containing photocatalytic concrete. A key outcome from this study
   revealed that at a 40-year service life, assuming a 6 mg/h/m(2) NOx
   degradation rate, a barrier designed with 100\%GU cement and a 25mm
   photocatalytic concrete cover has an annual cost that is 7\%, 30\%, and
   36\% greater than the 100\%GU, 35\% and 50\%GGBFS barriers without a
   photocatalytic cover, respectively. Results of this analysis also
   indicated that the application of a 25mm photocatalytic concrete cover
   to concrete containing 35 and 50\%GGBFS is more economically feasible
   than 100\%GU concrete, irrespective of the service life and pollution
   degradation rate.}},

Title = {{Does skull shape mediate the relationship between objective features and

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{79}},
Pages = {{234-240}},
Month = {{OCT 1}},
Abstract = {{In our previous work, we described facial features associated with a
   successful recognition of the sex of the face (Mareckova et al., 2011).
   These features were based on landmarks placed on the surface of faces
   reconstructed from magnetic resonance (MR) images; their position was
   therefore influenced by both soft tissue (fat and muscle) and bone
   structure of the skull. Here, we ask whether bone structure has
   dissociable influences on observers' identification of the sex of the
   face. To answer this question, we used a novel method of studying skull
   morphology using MR images and explored the relationship between skull
   features, facial features, and sex recognition in a large sample of
   adolescents (n = 876; including 475 adolescents from our original
   report). To determine whether skull features mediate the relationship
   between facial features and identification accuracy, we performed
   mediation analysis using bootstrapping. In males, skull features
   mediated fully the relationship between facial features and sex
   judgments. In females, the skull mediated this relationship only after
   adjusting facial features for the amount of body fat (estimated with
   bioimpedance). While body fat had a very slight positive influence on
   correct sex judgments about male faces, there was a robust negative
   influence of body fat on the correct sex judgments about female faces.
   Overall, these results suggest that craniofacial bone structure is
   essential for correct sex judgments about a male face. In females, body
   fat influences negatively the accuracy of sex judgments, and
   craniofacial bone structure alone cannot explain the relationship
   between facial features and identification of a face as female. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{This study proposes an adaptive intelligent algorithm for forecasting
   and improving mental workload among operators with respect to HSEE in
   large gas Treatment Company. The algorithm is composed of reliability,
   verification, validation and forecasting mechanisms through robust
   mathematical and statistical methods, Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   and Adaptive Network Based Fuzzy Inference System Algorithm (ANFIS). To
   achieve the objectives of this study, standard questionnaires with
   respect to HSEE are completed by operators. The average results for each
   category of HSEE are used as inputs and mental workload is used as
   output in the algorithm. The efficiency of ANN is examined against ANFIS
   by use of Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results concluded
   that ANN provides better solutions than ANFIS. Therefore, ANN is used to
   forecast and rank operators performance with respect to HSEE and mental
   workload. Normal probability technique is used to identify outlier
   operators. Moreover, operators with inadequate mental workload with
   respect to HSEE are identified. This would help managers to foresee if
   operators are satisfied with their mental workload in the context of
   HSEE. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the intelligent algorithm is
   shown by error analysis in contrast with conventional regression
   approaches. This is the first study that introduces an adaptive
   algorithm for efficient forecasting of mental workload with respect to
   HSEE program in complex systems. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{DC-DC converters, used in bidirectional applications such as
   battery/u-cap hybrid energy-storage systems, usually operate in current
   mode with a wide range of input and output voltages. Conventional
   current-mode control schemes, which requires adaptive slope
   compensation, are not attractive in these applications. In this paper, a
   class of self-oscillating hysteretic current-mode control (HCMC) schemes
   with frequency stabilization are analyzed and compared. Among them, the
   ripple HCMC scheme has the advantages of the inherent access to the
   average inductor current information, and inherent decoupling between
   the voltage and the frequency loops. The modeling and design procedure
   of two frequency regulation methods, namely the phase-locked loop (PLL)
   and delay-locked loop (DLL), are presented and compared in detail. The
   analysis is applicable to a range of inductive converters such as buck,
   boost, and buck-boost. HCMC implemented with a DLL is shown to not only
   offer comparable bandwidth compared to the PLL, but is also more robust
   against system parameter variations. The ripple HCMC controllers with
   PLL and DLL are implemented digitally, and the two schemes are verified
   experimentally on a 1 MHz 1-2.5 V to 5 V bidirectional boost converter
   prototype.}},

   heterointerface}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{114}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{SEP 28}},
Abstract = {{The photostability of the amorphous-crystalline silicon heterointerface
   is investigated. It is revealed that the metastability of hydrogenated
   amorphous silicon (a-Si: H) causes significant light induced changes in
   the heterointerface. Unlike bulk a-Si: H, the photostability of the
   heterointerface is not controlled by the microstructural properties of
   a-Si: H but rather by the initial heterointerface properties. Interfaces
   that initially have low interface defect density show the greatest
   degradation while those that initially have high interface defect
   density actually show light-induced improvement. It is shown that the
   degree of light induced change in the interface defect density is
   linearly proportional to the natural logarithm of the initial interface
   defect density. Further, it is revealed that the kinetics of
   light-induced change in the heterointerface defect density can be faster
   or slower than light-induced changes in bulk a-Si: H films depending on
   the initial properties of the heterointerface. Light soaking
   measurements on heterointerfaces with doped a-Si: H films reveal that
   interface defect density of these structures improves with light
   soaking. It is proposed that this is caused by a combination of the high
   initial interface defect density of samples using doped a-Si: H films
   and reduced generation of defects near the heterointerface due to the
   enhanced field effect provided by the doped films. (C) 2013 AIP

Abstract = {{Certain natural organisms use micro-patterned surface chemistry, or
   ice-nucleating species, to control water condensation and ice nucleation
   for survival under extreme conditions. As an analogy to these biological
   approaches, it is shown that functionalized, hydrophilic polymers and
   particles deposited on the tips of superhydrophobic posts induce precise
   topographical control over water condensation and freezing at the
   micrometer scale. A bottom-up deposition process is used to take
   advantage of the limited contact area of a non-wetting aqueous solution
   on a superhydrophobic surface. Hydrophilic polymer deposition on the
   tips of these geometrical structures allows spatial control over the
   nucleation, growth, and coalescence of micrometer-scale water droplets.
   The hydrophilic tips nucleate water droplets with extremely uniform
   nucleation and growth rates, uniform sizes, an increased stability
   against coalescence, and asymmetric droplet morphologies. Control of
   freezing behavior is also demonstrated via deposition of ice-nucleating
   AgI nanoparticles on the tips of these structures. This combination of
   the hydrophilic polymer and AgI particles on the tips was used to
   achieve templating of ice nucleation at the micrometer scale.
   Preliminary results indicate that control over ice crystal size, spatial
   symmetry, and position might be possible with this method. This type of
   approach can serve as a platform for systematically analyzing
   micrometer-scale condensation and freezing phenomena, and as a model for
   natural systems.}},

Abstract = {{Utilizing ENU mutagenesis, we identified a mutant mouse with elevated
   platelets. Genetic mapping localized the mutation to an interval on
   chromosome 19 that encodes the Jak2 tyrosine kinase. We identified a
   A3056T mutation resulting in a premature stop codon within exon 19 of
   Jak2 (Jak2(K915X)), resulting in a protein truncation and functionally
   inactive enzyme. This novel platelet phenotype was also observed in mice
   bearing a hemizygous targeted disruption of the Jak2 locus (Jak2(+/-)).
   Timed pregnancy experiments revealed that Jak2(K915X/K915X) and
   Jak2(-/-) displayed embryonic lethality; however, Jak2(K915X/K915X)
   embryos were viable an additional two days compared to Jak2(-/-)
   embryos. Our data suggest that perturbing JAK2 activation may have
   unexpected consequences in elevation of platelet number and
   correspondingly, important implications for treatment of hematological
   disorders with constitutive Jak2 activity.}},

Abstract = {{Atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy (AFM) was employed to
   probe the forces of interaction between iron oxide (magnetite) surfaces
   and fresh zero-valent iron particles, either bare or coated with
   carboxymethyl cellulose polymer. Experiments were conducted at different
   pH values (4, 5.5 and 8), ionic strengths (water, 100 mM NaCl and 100 mM
   CaCl2), and in 10 mg/l humic acid solutions (pH 6.75). pH values of 4
   and 5.5 produced attraction between magnetite and iron particles (either
   bare or polymer coated), promoting attachment. Attractive forces between
   uncoated particles and magnetite were also measured in 100 mM NaCl and
   CaCl2 at pH 8. Attachment of uncoated and CMC-coated iron particles was
   unfavorable in water at pH 8 and in humic acid solutions, as the forces
   upon approach were repulsive and, in addition, adhesive forces were on
   average weaker than in the other chemistries. A quartz-crystal
   microbalance with dissipation monitoring was used to probe humic acid
   sorption onto magnetite, and assess its impact on the forces of

Abstract = {{We analyze a novel antenna effect that resonantly enhances the
   photocurrent response of end-contacted P-i-N junction nanowire gratings,
   due to coupling of incident radiation into the grating's
   multiple-scattering electromagnetic modes. Quantitative characterization
   of these resonances was performed by spectral and polarization-resolved
   photocurrent measurements on gratings with N = 500, 200 and 100
   nanowires, aided by electron beam-induced current measurements, and in
   excellent agreement with electromagnetic scattering theory. Despite the
   small scattering cross-section of each nanowire, with triangular
   cross-section (height 8 nm, width 6 nm), the measured quality factor of
   the resonances Q approximate to 10 exceeds that of the empty SiO2 cavity
   without degradation for gratings of as few as 100 nanowires.
   Photoresponse retains sinusoidal polarization anisotropy characteristic
   of single nanowires. We discuss strategies for improving Q and present a
   grating design tailoring resonant field enhancement at red, green or
   blue wavelengths, for three different grating periods of l = 460, 400
   and 320 nm.}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidics (DMF) is an emerging technique for manipulating
   small volumes of liquids. DMF is particularly well suited for analytical
   applications as it allows automated handling of discrete samples, and it
   has been integrated with several inline analysis techniques However,
   examples of the integration of DMF with electroanalytical methods are
   notably scarce, and those that have been reported rely on external
   electrodes that impose limitations on complexity. To combine the full
   capabilities of DMF with voltammetry, we designed a platform featuring a
   three-electrode electrochemical cell integrated in a microfabricated DMF
   device, removing the need for external electrodes and allowing for
   complete droplet control. The performance of the DMF/voltammetry system
   is comparable to that of a commercial screen printed electrode, and the
   new platform was applied to generating a calibration series for
   acetaminophen with a limit of detection of 76 mu M and good precision
   (4\% average RSD), all with minimal human intervention. We propose that
   this platform and variations thereof may be a useful new tool for
   microscale electroanalysis and will be a complementary system to
   existing inline analysis techniques for DMF.}},

Abstract = {{Our study evaluates life cycle energy use and GHG emissions of
   lignocellulosic ethanol and bioelectricity use in U.S. light-duty
   vehicles. The well-to-pump, pump-to-wheel, and vehicle cycle stages are
   modeled. All ethanol (E85) and bioelectricity pathways have similar life
   cycle fossil energy use (similar to 100 MJ/100 vehicle kilometers
   traveled (VKT)) and net GHG emissions (similar to 5 kg CO(2)eq./100
   VKT), considerably lower.(65-85\%) than those of reference gasoline and
   U.S. grid-electricity pathways. E85 use in a, hybrid vehicle and
   bioelectricity use in a fully electric vehicle also have similar life
   cycle biomass and total energy use (similar to 350 and similar to 450
   MJ/100 VKT, respectively); differences in well-to-pump and pump-to-wheel
   efficiencies can largely offset each other. Our energy use and net GHG
   emissions results contrast with findings in literature, which report
   better performance on these metrics for bioelectricity compared to
   ethanol. The primary source of differences in the studies is related to
   our development of pathways with comparable vehicle characteristics.
   Ethanol or vehicle electrification can reduce petroleum use, while
   bioelectricity may displace nonpetroleum energy sources. Regional
   characteristics may create conditions under which either ethanol or
   bioelectricity may be the superior option; however, neither has a clear
   advantage in terms of GHG emissions or energy use.}},

Journal = {{SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{116}},
Pages = {{222-229}},

Abstract = {{Selenate (SeO42-) is a toxic soluble compound and its presence in the
   environment should be minimized. Reduction of selenate ions by elemental
   iron is a promising approach for treating contaminated waters. However,
   uncertainty exists regarding both the favorable conditions required and
   the associated mechanisms. In this study, the kinetics and mechanisms of
   selenate removal using Fe degrees at different pH and aeration rates was
   investigated using quantitative measurement of reactants and products.
   Under acidic anaerobic conditions, selenate was reduced directly by Fe
   degrees. Limited aeration increased removal rates by up to four times
   due to formation of reactive Fe(II)-bearing solid intermediates on the
   iron surface. Further increase in aeration rate decreased removal rates
   but also decreased iron release and acid consumption. Under basic
   conditions, selenate by Fe degrees was negligible under anaerobic
   conditions and low under limited aeration. Selenate removal rates were
   shown to be dependent on Se concentration, on available reducing solid
   surface and on competition with oxygen over electrons. (c) 2013 Elsevier

Title = {{Towards practical time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry
   lignocellulolytic enzyme assays}},
Journal = {{BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Month = {{SEP 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) is
   a surface sensitive mass spectrometry technique with potential strengths
   as a method for detecting enzymatic activity on solid materials. In
   particular, ToF-SIMS has been applied to detect the enzymatic
   degradation of woody lignocellulose. Proof-of-principle experiments
   previously demonstrated the detection of both lignin-degrading and
   cellulose-degrading enzymes on solvent-extracted hardwood and softwood.
   However, these preliminary experiments suffered from low sample
   throughput and were restricted to samples which had been
   solvent-extracted in order to minimize the potential for mass
   interferences between low molecular weight extractive compounds and
   polymeric lignocellulose components.
   Results: The present work introduces a new, higher-throughput method for
   processing powdered wood samples for ToF-SIMS, meanwhile exploring
   likely sources of sample contamination. Multivariate analysis (MVA)
   including Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Multivariate Curve
   Resolution (MCR) was regularly used to check for sample contamination as
   well as to detect extractives and enzyme activity. New data also
   demonstrates successful ToF-SIMS analysis of unextracted samples,
   placing an emphasis on identifying the low-mass secondary ion peaks
   related to extractives, revealing how extractives change previously
   established peak ratios used to describe enzyme activity, and
   elucidating peak intensity patterns for better detection of cellulase
   activity in the presence of extractives. The sensitivity of ToF-SIMS to
   a range of cellulase doses is also shown, along with preliminary
   experiments augmenting the cellulase cocktail with other proteins.
   Conclusions: These new procedures increase the throughput of sample
   preparation for ToF-SIMS analysis of lignocellulose and expand the
   applications of the method to include unextracted lignocellulose. These
   are important steps towards the practical use of ToF-SIMS as a tool to
   screen for changes in plant composition, whether the transformation of
   the lignocellulose is achieved through enzyme application, plant
   mutagenesis, or other treatments.}},

   index resolution. Both sensors were optimized using a genetic algorithm
   to acquire their best performance for bulk sensing applications. The
   experimental results show that the PWR sensor has a refractive index
   resolution of 5 x 10(-7) RIU which is 6 times smaller than that of the
   optimized SPR sensor. The TE polarization in the PWR sensor has a
   resolution of 1.4 x 10(-6) RIU which is smaller than the SPR sensor. The
   polarization diversity in the PWR sensor is another advantage which can
   be used to improve the measurement reliability. (C) 2013 Optical Society

Abstract = {{Dynamic contrast-enhanced computed tomography (DCE-CT) is an imaging
   tool that aids in evaluating functional characteristics of tissue at
   different stages of disease management: diagnostic, radiation treatment
   planning, treatment effectiveness, and monitoring. Clinical validation
   of DCE-derived perfusion parameters remains an outstanding problem to
   address prior to perfusion imaging becoming a widespread standard as a
   non-invasive quantitative measurement tool. One approach to this
   validation process has been the development of quality assurance
   phantoms in order to facilitate controlled perfusion ex vivo. However,
   most of these systems fail to establish and accurately replicate
   physiologically relevant capillary permeability and exchange
   performance. The current work presents the first step in the development
   of a prospective suite of physics-based perfusion simulations based on
   coupled fluid flow and particle transport phenomena with the goal of
   enhancing the understanding of clinical contrast agent kinetics.
   Existing knowledge about a controllable, two-compartmental fluid
   exchange phantom was used to validate the computational fluid dynamics
   (CFD) simulation model presented herein. The sensitivity of CFD-derived
   contrast uptake curves to contrast injection parameters, including
   injection duration and flow rate, were quantified and found to be within
   10\% accuracy. The CFD model was employed to evaluate two commonly used
   clinical kinetic algorithms used to derive perfusion parameters: Fick's
   principle and the modified Tofts model. Neither kinetic model was able
   to capture the true transport phenomena it aimed to represent but if the
   overall contrast concentration after injection remained identical, then
   successive DCE-CT evaluations could be compared and could indeed reflect
   differences in regional tissue flow. This study sets the groundwork for
   future explorations in phantom development and pharmacokinetic
   modelling, as well as the development of novel contrast agents for DCE
   imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Electron-deficient pi-conjugated polymers are important for organic
   electronics, yet the ability to polymerize electron-deficient monomers
   in a controlled manner is challenging. Here we show that Ni(II)diimine
   catalysts are well suited for the controlled polymerization of
   electron-deficient heterocycles. The relative stability of the
   calculated catalyst monomer (or catalyst-chain end) complex directly
   influences the polymerization. When the complex is predicted to be most
   stable (139.2 kJ/mol), these catalysts display rapid reaction kinetics,
   leading to relatively low polydispersities (similar to 1.5) chain
   lengths that are controlled by monomer:catalyst ratio, controlled
   monomer consumption up to 60\% conversion, linear chain length growth up
   to 40\% conversion, and `living' chain ends that can be readily extended
   by adding more monomer. These are desirable features that highlight the
   importance of catalyst design for the synthesis of new conjugated
   polymers.}},

Abstract = {{This article examines how catastrophe events affect risk analysis from a
   financial perspective. Data from different industries such as Advanced
   Sustainable Performance Indices, gold, energy, real estate, and
   insurance were collected and analyzed. The performance of these funds
   was compared by using various financial ratios. Then we tested the stock
   selecting and market timing abilities. We also assessed whether a
   particular catastrophe event has affected stock prices by analysis of
   two event studies, the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States and
   the collapse through bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers. We examined how an
   asset portfolio performs under catastrophic events and under the
   situation of adding Advanced Sustainable Performance Indices into an
   investor's portfolio basket. We found that the 9/11 terrorist attacks
   affected the Dow Jones Real Estate Index's prices a lot. Lehman
   Brothers' bankruptcyfiling had a positive impact on the CBOE Gold Index,
   and had a large impact on the Fidelity US Bond Index. The ASPI Index in
   our optimization problem gave us better diversification. From our
   analysis, we conclude that portfolio diversification is a good way to
   hedge against catastrophic risk.}},

Abstract = {{Micro-grid operation mode, which is the combination of a power grid and
   distributed generation, is the main way for saving investment, reducing
   energy consumption, and improving a power system's reliability and
   flexibility, but it has many risks in the process of implementation. In
   this article, the micro-grid generation structure of a wind farm was
   established, a processing flow chart of an intelligent management system
   was drawn, and a risk management model of a micro-grid wind farm was
   built from the angle of cost risk, including construction of cost risk
   and operation cost risk models. The construction cost risk model,
   grid-connected operation, and isolate-operation cost risk model of a
   micro-grid wind farm were set up by using a mathematical model that
   consisted of an objective function and constraint conditions. The
   accuracy of the model was verified through empirical analysis. This
   provides a reference and mirror for solving grid-connected wind energy
   problems and gives an important basis for wind energy risk
   policy-making, and for avoiding the risks in the process of planning,
   design, and operation management of a wind farm.}},

Journal = {{ACS NANO}},

Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{9}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Colloidal quantum dot (COD) solids are attractive materials for
   photovoltaic devices due to their low-cost solution-phase processing,
   high absorption cross sections, and their band gap tunability via the
   quantum size effect. Recent advances in COD solar cell performance have
   relied on new surface passivation strategies. Specifically, cadmium
   cation passivation of surface chalcogen sites in PbS CQDs has been shown
   to contribute to lowered trap state densities and improved photovoltaic
   performance. Here we deploy a generalized solution-phase passivation
   strategy as a means to improving COD surface management. We connect the
   effects of the choice of metal cation on solution-phase surface
   passivation, film-phase trap density of states, minority carrier
   mobility, and photovoltaic power conversion efficiency. We show that
   trap passivation and midgap density of states determine photovoltaic
   device performance and are strongly influenced by the choice of metal
   cation. Supported by density functional theory simulations, we propose a
   model for the role of cations, a picture wherein metals offering the
   shallowest electron affinities and the greatest adaptability in surface
   bonding configurations eliminate both deep and shallow traps effectively
   even in submonolayer amounts. This work illustrates the importance of
   materials choice in designing a flexible passivation strategy for
   optimum COD device performance.}},

Abstract = {{Rapid and direct genetic analysis of low numbers of bacteria using
   chip-based sensors is limited by the slow diffusion of mRNA molecules.
   Long incubation times are required in dilute solutions in order to
   collect a sufficient number of molecules at the sensor surface to
   generate a detectable signal. To overcome this barrier here we present
   an integrated device that leverages electrochemistry-driven lysis less
   than 50 mu m away from electrochemical nucleic acid sensors to overcome
   this barrier. Released intracellular mRNA can diffuse the short distance
   to the sensors within minutes, enabling rapid and sensitive detection.
   We validate this strategy through direct lysis and detection of E. coli
   mRNA at concentrations as low as 0.4 CFU/mu L in 2 min, a clinically
   relevant combination of speed and sensitivity for a sample-to-answer
   molecular analysis approach.}},

Abstract = {{Transgenic mice have been previously used to assess nerve regeneration
   following peripheral nerve injury. However, mouse models are limited by
   their small caliber nerves, short nerve lengths, and their inability to
   fully participate during behavioral assessments. The transgenic Thy1GFP
   rat is a novel transgenic rat model designed to assess regeneration
   following peripheral nerve injury. However, return of functional and
   behavioral recovery following nerve injury has not yet been evaluated in
   these rats. In this study, we ask whether differences in anatomy,
   recovery of locomotion, myological, and histomorphological measures
   exist between transgenic Thy1GFP rats when compared to wild type (WT)
   Sprague Dawley rats following unilateral sciatic nerve injury. We found
   that both motor and sensory neuronal architecture, overground and
   skilled locomotion, muscle force, motor unit number estimation (MUNE)
   and wet muscle weights, and histomorphometric assessments are similar
   between both genetic phenotypes. Overall, these data support the use of
   the transgenic Thy1-GFP rat in experiments assessing functional and

Abstract = {{In this paper, we revisit the problem of multiparty conferencing from a
   practical perspective, and to rethink the design space involved in this
   problem. We believe that an emphasis on low end-to-end delays between
   any two parties in the conference is a must, and the source sending rate
   in a session should adapt to bandwidth availability and congestion. We
   present Celerity, a multi-party conferencing solution specifically
   designed to achieve our objectives. It is entirely Peer-to-Peer (P2P),
   and as such eliminating the cost of maintaining centrally administered
   servers. It is designed to deliver video with low end-to-end delays, at
   quality levels commensurate with available network resources over
   arbitrary network topologies where bottlenecks can be anywhere in the
   network. This is in contrast to commonly assumed P2P scenarios where
   bandwidth bottlenecks reside only at the edge of the network. The
   highlight in our design is a distributed and adaptive rate control
   protocol, that can discover and adapt to arbitrary topologies and
   network conditions quickly, converging to efficient link rate
   allocations allowed by the underlying network. In accordance with
   adaptive link rate control, source video encoding rates are also
   dynamically controlled to optimize video quality in arbitrary and
   unpredictable network conditions. We have implemented Celerity in a
   prototype system, and demonstrate its superior performance over existing
   solutions in a local experimental testbed and over the Internet.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we explore the design space and practice of a new
   peer-to-peer (P2P) storage cloud, which is capable of replicating,
   refreshing and on-demand streaming of cinematic-quality video streams,
   in a decentralized fashion using local storage spaces of end users. We
   identify key design challenges and tradeoffs in such a P2P storage
   cloud, and how these are addressed by making informed design choices in
   a step-by-step fashion. Following our design choices, we have
   implemented a real-world Video-on-Demand (VoD) system with over 100,000
   lines of code, called Novasky, which features new coding-aware peer
   storage replacement and server push-to-peer strategies, in order to
   maintain media availability and to balance the system-wide supply-demand
   relationship in the P2P storage cloud. Since September 2009, it has been
   deployed in the Tsinghua University campus network, attracting 10,000
   users during our measurement studies from February to July 2010, and
   providing over 1,000 cinematic-quality video streams with bit rates of 1
   - 2 Mbps. Based on real-world traces collected over 6 months, we show
   that Novasky can achieve rapid startups within 4 - 9 seconds and
   extremely short seek latencies within 3 seconds, while maintaining
   reasonable operational overhead and server bandwidth costs. Our general
   understanding on the design tradeoffs of P2P storage cloud and practical
   experiences with Novasky may bring valuable guidelines to future designs
   of production-quality P2P storage cloud systems.}},

Abstract = {{Chaotic non-linear dynamics approach is now the most powerful tool for
   scientists to deal with complexities in real cases; and artificial
   neural networks and neuro-fuzzy models are widely used for their
   capabilities in non-linear modelling of chaotic systems. Chaos,
   uncertain behaviours, demanding fluctuation, complexity of the traffic
   flow situations and the problems with those methods, however, caused the
   forecasting traffic flow values to lack robustness and precision. In
   this study, the traffic flow forecasting is analysed by emotional
   concepts and multi-agent systems (MASs) points of view as a new method.
   Its architecture is based on a temporal difference (TD) Q-learning with
   a neuro-fuzzy structure. The performance of TD Q-learning method is
   improved by emotional learning. The concept of emotional TD Q-learning
   method is discussed for the first time in this study. The forecasting
   algorithm which uses the Q-learning algorithm is capable of finding the
   optimal forecasting approach as the one obtained by the reinforcement
   learning. In addition, in order to study in a more practical situation,
   the neuro-fuzzy behaviours can be modelled by MAS. The real traffic flow
   signals used for fitting the proposed methods are obtained from
   interstate I-494 in Minnesota City in USA and the E17 motorway

Abstract = {{This paper presents a study of fracture in nickel using multiscale
   modeling. A comparison of six concurrent multiscale methods was
   performed in their application to a common problem using a common
   framework in order to evaluate each method relative to each other. Each
   method was compared in both a quasi-static case of crack tip deformation
   as well as a dynamic case in the study of crack growth. Each method was
   compared to the fully atomistic model with similarities and differences
   between the methods noted and reasons for these provided. The results
   showed a distinct difference between direct and handshake coupling
   methods. In general, for the quasi-static case, the direct coupling
   methods took longer to run compared to the handshake coupling methods
   but had less error with respect to displacement and energy. In the
   dynamic case, the handshake methods took longer to run, but had reduced
   error most notably when wave dissipation at the atomistic/continuum
   region was an issue. Comparing each method under common conditions
   showed that many similarities exist between each method that may be
   hidden by their original formulation. The comparison also showed the
   dependency on the application as well as the simulation techniques used
   in determining the performance of each method.}},

Abstract = {{It is generally accepted that a custom hardware implementation of a set
   of computations will provide superior speed and energy efficiency
   relative to a software implementation. However, the cost and difficulty
   of hardware design is often prohibitive, and consequently, a software
   approach is used for most applications. In this article, we introduce a
   new high-level synthesis tool called LegUp that allows software
   techniques to be used for hardware design. LegUp accepts a standard C
   program as input and automatically compiles the program to a hybrid
   architecture containing an FPGA-based MIPS soft processor and custom
   hardware accelerators that communicate through a standard bus interface.
   In the hybrid processor/accelerator architecture, program segments that
   are unsuitable for hardware implementation can execute in software on
   the processor. LegUp can synthesize most of the C language to hardware,
   including fixed-sized multidimensional arrays, structs, global
   variables, and pointer arithmetic. Results show that the tool produces
   hardware solutions of comparable quality to a commercial high-level
   synthesis tool. We also give results demonstrating the ability of the
   tool to explore the hardware/software codesign space by varying the
   amount of a program that runs in software versus hardware. LegUp, along
   with a set of benchmark C programs, is open source and freely
   downloadable, providing a powerful platform that can be leveraged for
   new research on a wide range of high-level synthesis topics.}},

Abstract = {{To evaluate measures to prevent alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete

   cement concrete cracked at 5 years and low-alkali cement cracked after
   12 years. The high-alkali cement Wwas replaced with various amounts of
   SCMs. Two concretes, containing 50\% ground-granulated blast-furnace
   slag (GGBFS) and a ternary blend of 25\% slag plus 3.8\% silica fume
   interground with a high-alkali portland cement, have neither expanded

Abstract = {{In this paper, the coordinated charging control problem for plug-in
   electric vehicles (PEVs) with vehicle-to-grid functionality is
   formulated and investigated at the residential transformer level. A
   two-stage charging control (TSCC) strategy is proposed to shift the
   transformer load while achieving good charging performance for all PEVs
   connected to the grid. The proposed TSCC consists of an aggregator
   optimizer and a power distributor designed in two stages with different
   control functions. During the first stage, based on the dynamic
   aggregator concept, the optimal charging power for all PEVs in the
   aggregator is derived using the Pontryagin's minimum principle. During
   the second stage, a power distribution law is developed to allocate the
   aggregated power from the first stage using the fuzzy logic control
   approach. The TSCC framework considers the stochastic characteristics
   and nonlinear battery dynamics of practical vehicle charging scenarios,
   and therefore, is feasible for practical implementation. Finally,
   simulation results are presented to validate the control performance of
   the TSCC.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the relation between message delivery delay and
   reliability for the communication between a vehicle and a road side unit
   (RSU). We focus on sparse vehicular sensor networks (VSNs), where timely
   message delivery and reliable transmission are of significant
   importance. We present a mathematical framework for the message delivery
   delay distribution for a two-lane road, where vehicles in one direction
   act as message carriers for the ones in the other direction and have the
   freedom to leave the road from randomly distributed road junctions with
   a certain probability. Packet generator vehicles store the original
   packets till meeting an RSU while sending multiple copies of each packet
   to packet carrier vehicles. Our analysis offers an analytical tool for
   an intelligent transportation system (ITS) service provider to determine
   the minimum RSU density required to cover a road for meeting a
   probabilistic requirement of the message delay. Extensive computer
   simulation results show the accuracy of our analysis and clearly
   indicate the relation of packet delay and the number of packet replicas.}},

Abstract = {{The constraints imposed by the laser safety (maximum permissible

   thermal-wave signals in tissues significantly limit the photothermally
   active depth in most biological specimens to a level which is normally
   insufficient for practical applications (a few mm below the skin
   surface). A theoretical approach for improvement of the signal-to-noise
   ratio (SNR), minimizing the static (dc) component of the photothermal
   (PT) signal and making use of the PT radiometric nonlinearity has been
   introduced. At low frequencies fixed-pulse-width chirps of large peak
   power were found to be superior to all other equal energy modalities,
   with an SNR improvement by up to two orders of magnitude. Compared to
   radar peak delay and amplitude, the long-delayed radar output amplitude
   is found to be more sensitive to subsurface conditions. Two-dimensional
   spatial plots of this parameter depicting the back-surface conditions of
   bones with and without fat tissue overlayers are presented. Pulsed-chirp
   radar thermography has been demonstrated to monitor the degree of
   demineralization in goat rib bone with a substantial SNR and spatial

Abstract = {{We treat selected test cases in the third world wide failure exercise by
   the approach described as synergistic damage mechanics. This approach
   utilizes micromechanics and continuum damage mechanics to predict the
   overall mechanical response of composite laminates with ply cracking in
   multiple orientations. The material constants needed in the continuum
   damage mechanic formulation are calculated from stiffness property
   changes incurred in a reference laminate. For other laminate
   configurations, the stiffness changes are derived using a relative
   constraint parameter which is calculated from the constraint on the
   opening displacement of ply cracks within the given cracked laminate
   evaluated numerically by a finite element analysis of appropriately
   constructed representative unit cell. The number density of ply cracks
   (cracks per unit length normal to the crack planes) under quasi-static
   loading is calculated by an energy-based approach. Finally, the
   stress-strain response of a laminate is determined by combining
   stiffness property changes and evolution of crack number density.}},

Abstract = {{Dynamic failure of brittle materials is a fundamental physical problem
   that has significantly impacts to many science and engineering
   disciplines. As the first and the most important step towards the full
   understanding of this problem, one has to observe dynamic damage
   accumulation in brittle solids. In this work, we proposed a methodology
   to do that and demonstrated it by studying the dynamic compressive
   damage evolution of a granitic rock loaded with a modified split
   Hopkinson pressure bar system. To ensure consistency of the experimental
   results, we used cylindrical rock samples fabricated from the same rock
   core and subjected them to identical incident loading pulse. Using a
   special soft recovery technique, we stopped the dynamic loading on the
   samples at different strain levels, ranging from 0.3\% to 1.4\%.
   Therefore, we were able to recover intact samples loaded all the way to
   the post-peak deformation stage. The recovered samples were subsequently
   examined with X-ray micro-CT scanning machine. Three dimensional
   microcrack network induced by the dynamic loading was observed and the
   evolution of microcracks as a function of the dynamic loading strain was
   obtained. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.}},

Abstract = {{Likelihood-based algorithms for the classification of linear digital
   modulations are systematically investigated for a multiple receive
   antennas configuration. Existing modulation classification (MC)
   algorithms are first extended to the case of multiple receive antennas
   and then a critical problem is identified that the overall performance
   of the multiple antenna systems is dominated by the worst channel
   estimate of a particular antenna. To address the performance degradation
   issue, we propose a new MC algorithm by optimally combining the log
   likelihood functions (LLFs). Furthermore, to analyze the upper-bound
   performance of the existing and the proposed MC algorithms, the exact
   Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) expressions of non-data-aided joint
   estimates of amplitude, phase, and noise variance are derived for
   general rectangular quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). Numerical
   results demonstrate the accuracy of the CRLB expressions and verify that
   the results reported in the literature for quadrature phase-shift keying
   (QPSK) and 16-QAM are special cases of our derived expressions. Also, it
   is demonstrated that the probability of correct classification of the
   new algorithm approaches the theoretical bounds and a substantial
   performance improvement is achieved compared to the existing MC
   algorithm.}},

Title = {{Multiagent Reinforcement Learning for Integrated Network of Adaptive
   Traffic Signal Controllers (MARLIN-ATSC): Methodology and Large-Scale

Abstract = {{Population is steadily increasing worldwide, resulting in intractable
   traffic congestion in dense urban areas. Adaptive traffic signal control
   (ATSC) has shown strong potential to effectively alleviate urban traffic
   congestion by adjusting signal timing plans in real time in response to
   traffic fluctuations to achieve desirable objectives (e.g., minimize
   delay). Efficient and robust ATSC can be designed using a multiagent
   reinforcement learning (MARL) approach in which each controller (agent)
   is responsible for the control of traffic lights around a single traffic
   junction. Applying MARL approaches to the ATSC problem is associated
   with a few challenges as agents typically react to changes in the
   environment at the individual level, but the overall behavior of all
   agents may not be optimal. This paper presents the development and
   evaluation of a novel system of multiagent reinforcement learning for
   integrated network of adaptive traffic signal controllers (MARLIN-ATSC).
   MARLIN-ATSC offers two possible modes: 1) independent mode, where each
   intersection controller works independently of other agents; and 2)
   integrated mode, where each controller coordinates signal control
   actions with neighboring intersections. MARLIN-ATSC is tested on a
   large-scale simulated network of 59 intersections in the lower downtown
   core of the City of Toronto, ON, Canada, for the morning rush hour. The
   results show unprecedented reduction in the average intersection delay
   ranging from 27\% in mode 1 to 39\% in mode 2 at the network level and
   travel-time savings of 15\% in mode 1 and 26\% in mode 2, along the
   busiest routes in Downtown Toronto.}},

Abstract = {{The joint source-channel coding (JSCC) problem for
   soft-decision-demodulated time-correlated fading channels is
   investigated without the use of channel coding and interleaving. For the
   purpose of system design, the recently introduced nonbinary noise
   discrete channel with queue-based (QB) noise (NBNDC-QB) is adopted. This
   analytically tractable Markovian model has been shown to represent
   effectively correlated fading channels that are hard to handle
   analytically. Optimal sequence maximum a posteriori (MAP) detection of a
   discrete Markov source sent over the NBNDC-QB is first studied. When the
   Markov source is binary and symmetric, a necessary and sufficient
   condition under which the MAP decoder is reduced to a simple
   instantaneous symbol-by-symbol decoder is established. Two robust lossy
   source coding schemes with a low encoding delay are next proposed for
   the NBNDC-QB. The first scheme consists of a scalar quantizer (SQ), a
   proper index assignment, and a sequence MAP decoder designed to harness
   the redundancy left in the indexes of the quantizer and the
   soft-decision output and the noise correlation of the channel. The
   second scheme is a classical noise-resilient vector quantizer known as
   the channel-optimized vector quantizer (COVQ). It is demonstrated that
   both systems can successfully exploit the memory and soft-decision
   information of the channel. Signal-to-distortion-ratio (SDR) gains of
   more than 1.7 dB are obtained over hard-decision demodulation by using
   only two bits for soft decision. Furthermore, gains as high as 4.4 dB
   can be achieved for a strongly correlated channel, in comparison with
   systems designed for the ideally interleaved (memoryless) channel.
   Finally, it is numerically observed that, for low coding rates, the
   NBNDC-QB model can accurately approximate discrete fading channels
   (DFCs) in terms of SDR performance.}},

Title = {{Automated treatment planning for a dedicated multi-source intra-cranial
   radiosurgery treatment unit accounting for overlapping structures and
   dose homogeneity}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL PHYSICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{40}},
Number = {{9}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: The purpose of this work is to advance the two-step approach
   for Gamma Knife (R) Perfexion (TM) (PFX) optimization to account for
   dose homogeneity and overlap between the planning target volume (PTV)
   and organs-at-risk (OARs).
   Methods: In the first step, a geometry-based algorithm is used to
   quickly select isocentre locations while explicitly accounting for
   PTV-OARs overlaps. In this approach, the PTV is divided into sub-volumes
   based on the PTV-OARs overlaps and the distance of voxels to the
   overlaps. Only a few isocentres are selected in the overlap volume, and
   a higher number of isocentres are carefully selected among voxels that
   are immediately close to the overlap volume. In the second step, a
   convex optimization is solved to find the optimal combination of
   collimator sizes and their radiation duration for each isocentre
   location.
   Results: This two-step approach is tested on seven clinical cases
   (comprising 11 targets) for which the authors assess coverage, OARs
   dose, and homogeneity index and relate these parameters to the overlap
   fraction for each case. In terms of coverage, the mean V-99 for the
   gross target volume (GTV) was 99.8\% while the V-95 for the PTV averaged
   at 94.6\%, thus satisfying the clinical objectives of 99\% for GTV and
   95\% for PTV, respectively. The mean relative dose to the brainstem was
   87.7\% of the prescription dose (with maximum 108\%), while on average,
   11.3\% of the PTV overlapped with the brainstem. The mean beam-on time
   per fraction per dose was 8.6 min with calibration dose rate of 3.5
   Gy/min, and the computational time averaged at 205 min. Compared with
   previous work involving single-fraction radiosurgery, the resulting
   plans were more homogeneous with average homogeneity index of 1.18
   compared to 1.47.
   Conclusions: PFX treatment plans with homogeneous dose distribution can
   be achieved by inverse planning using geometric isocentre selection and
   mathematical modeling and optimization techniques. The quality of the
   obtained treatment plans are clinically satisfactory while the
   homogeneity index is improved compared to conventional PFX plans. (C)

Abstract = {{Objectives. We constructed age- and gender-specific norms for healthy
   adults on a large number of speech and voice measures using standardized
   recording procedures.
   Study design. Participants were 159 younger (mean = 19.1 years, standard
   deviation {[}SD] = 1.4) and 133 older (mean = 72.0 years, SD = 4.8)
   healthy native English male and female speakers who did not currently
   smoke and had typical hearing for their age group.
   Methods. Participants phonated the vowel {[}a] under various
   instructions and read an abbreviated version of the Rainbow Passage.
   Voice measures based on the productions of {[}a] included fundamental
   frequency (F-0), jitter, shimmer, harmonics-to-noise ratio,
   noise-to-harmonics ratio, maximum phonation time, minimum phonation
   intensity, maximum pitch, and the Dysphonia Severity Index (DSI). Mean
   speaking fundamental frequency (SF0), SF0 standard deviation (SF0SD),
   and signal intensity were measured from the reading passage.
   Results. Noteworthy age-related differences were found for males and
   females. Older females had a lower F-0 and SF0 and smaller SF0SD than
   younger females, but younger and older males did not differ. Shimmer
   increased with age for males, but neither jitter nor shimmer increased
   with age for females, whereas noise measures were similar for both ages.
   Younger and older males had a similar DSI, whereas older females had a
   higher DSI than younger females.
   Conclusions. This study provides a unique database containing a wide
   variety of voice measures collected from a large sample of adults in
   good health using standardized recording procedures. Males and females
   differed on the type and extent of age-related vocal changes, but
   overall age-related differences were limited.}},

   milliwatt-level, low-noise signal sources at submillimeter-wave
   frequencies. The fundamental frequency Colpitts VCO covers a 12\% tuning
   range between 218 and 246 GHz (the highest for SiGe HBTs) with up to
   -3.6-dBm output power and 0.8\% efficiency. The 300-GHz signal source,
   consisting of a Colpitts-Clapp VCO followed by a buffer amplifier and a
   doubler, shows -1.7-dBm output power around 290 GHz, -101-dBc/Hz phase
   noise at 10-MHz offset, 7.5\% tuning range, and 0.4\% efficiency.
   Finally, the push-push Colpitts-Clapp VCO exhibits the highest operation
   frequency, from 309 to 325 GHz, but with reduced efficiency of only
   0.07\% and 5\% tuning range. It was concluded that the differential
   cascode buffer placed between the VCO and doubler was instrumental in
   achieving the best phase noise and output power with good efficiency and
   without compromising tuning range.}},

Abstract = {{We present a cost-efficient and rapid prototyping technique for
   polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) microfluidic devices using a
   polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based hot embossing process. Compared to
   conventional hot embossing methods, this technique uses PDMS molds with
   enhanced thermo-mechanical properties. To improve the replication
   performance, increases in both PDMS stiffness and hardness were achieved
   through several processing and curing means. First, the amount of curing
   agent was increased from 1/10 to 1/5 with respect to the amount of
   prepolymer. Second, the cured PDMS was thermally aged either over three
   days at 85 degrees C or for 30 min at 250 degrees C. Those combined
   steps led to increases in stiffness and hardness of up to 150\% and
   32\%, respectively, as compared to standard PDMS molds. Using these
   enhanced molds, structures with features of the order of 100 mu m in
   PMMA are successfully embossed using a standard laboratory press at 150
   degrees C. The PDMS molds and process produce identical structures
   through multiple embossing cycles (>= 10) without any mold damage or
   deterioration. A Y-shaped microfluidic mixer was fabricated with this
   technique. The successful demonstration of this enhanced PDMS-based hot
   embossing technique introduces a new approach for the rapid prototyping
   of polymer-based microfluidic devices at low-cost.}},

Journal = {{POWDER TECHNOLOGY}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{245}},
Pages = {{189-198}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Biomass, in particular wood and wood residues, is of increasing
   importance as an energy source, in particular for direct combustion to
   produce electricity. Size reduction is a key step in biomass
   applications, and is generally energy intensive, such as when wood
   residues are pulverised to sizes below 1000 mu m for suspension firing.
   Wood residues may be pelletized for easier handling and transportation,
   and pelletized wood waste is frequently used as secondary fuel in coal
   fired furnaces, thus its grinding characteristics are of interest. For
   this study, Energex (TM) pelletized wood waste consisting of coniferous
   bark and wood was ground to fine sizes with a Szego Mill, a type of ring
   roller mill, at material rates up to about 500 kg/h on a dry basis in a
   pilot (22-cm diameter) mill, and 2000 kg/h in a commercial-scale (46-cm
   diameter) mill. Energy-product particle size relationships were
   determined, e.g., the specific energy E was of the order of 20 kWh/t
   oven-dry wood (ODW) for x(80) (80 wt.\% passing mesh size) = 1000 mu m.
   The specific energy required for the pelletized wood waste is an order
   of magnitude higher than for brittle materials such as quartz, coal,
   limestone and gypsum, but roughly one-quarter of that for newsprint, a
   fibrous material. Mathematical relationships were derived from first
   principles for the mill power P and mu(r), the coefficient of friction
   for rolling resistance of the rollers through the particle bed.
   Experiments show that as a first approximation, the resistance to roller
   motion, and hence mill power and specific energy, is independent of the
   type of material that is ground. For dry grinding of pelletized wood
   waste, moist aspen chips, air-dry sawdust, wheat, gypsum and limestone
   at 1000 rpm in the pilot-size mill, E = 3.14 x 10(3) (MR)(-0.764), where
   MR is the material rate, from which rolling resistance and mill power
   are roughly proportional to material rate to the exponent one-quarter.
   Mill power at constant material rate varied roughly with mill speed
   squared. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Pore-scale simulation of microbial growth using a genome-scale metabolic
   model: Implications for Darcy-scale reactive transport}},
Journal = {{ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Pages = {{256-270}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Recent advances in microbiology have enabled the quantitative simulation
   of microbial metabolism and growth based on genome-scale
   characterization of metabolic pathways and fluxes. We have incorporated
   a genome-scale metabolic model of the iron-reducing bacteria Geobacter
   sulfurreducens into a pore-scale simulation of microbial growth based on
   coupling of iron reduction to oxidation of a soluble electron donor
   (acetate). In our model, fluid flow and solute transport is governed by
   a combination of the Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion-reaction
   equations. Microbial growth occurs only on the surface of soil grains
   where solid-phase mineral iron oxides are available. Mass fluxes of
   chemical species associated with microbial growth are described by the
   genome-scale microbial model, implemented using a constraint-based
   metabolic model, and provide the Robin-type boundary condition for the
   advection-diffusion equation at soil grain surfaces.
   Conventional models of microbially-mediated subsurface reactions use a
   lumped reaction model that does not consider individual microbial
   reaction pathways, and describe reactions rates using
   empirically-derived rate formulations such as the Monod-type kinetics.
   We have used our pore-scale model to explore the relationship between
   genome-scale metabolic models and Monod-type formulations, and to assess
   the manifestation of pore-scale variability (microenvironments) in terms
   of apparent Darcy-scale microbial reaction rates. The genome-scale model
   predicted lower biomass yield, and different stoichiometry for iron
   consumption, in comparison to prior Monod formulations based on
   energetics considerations. We were able to fit an equivalent Monod
   model, by modifying the reaction stoichiometry and biomass yield
   coefficient, that could effectively match results of the genome-scale
   simulation of microbial behaviors under excess nutrient conditions, but
   predictions of the fitted Monod model deviated from those of the
   genome-scale model under conditions in which one or more nutrients were
   limiting.
   The fitted Monod kinetic model was also applied at the Darcy scale; that
   is, to simulate average reaction processes at the scale of the entire
   pore-scale model domain. As we expected, even under excess nutrient
   conditions for which the Monod and genome-scale models predicted equal
   reaction rates at the pore scale, the Monod model over-predicted the
   rates of biomass growth and iron and acetate utilization when applied at
   the Darcy scale. This discrepancy is caused by an inherent assumption of
   perfect mixing over the Darcy-scale domain, which is clearly violated in
   the pore-scale models. These results help to explain the need to modify
   the flux constraint parameters in order to match observations in
   previous applications of the genome-scale model at larger scales. These
   results also motivate further investigation of quantitative multi-scale
   relationships between fundamental behavior at the pore scale (where
   genome-scale models are appropriately applied) and observed behavior at
   larger scales (where predictions of reactive transport phenomena are
   needed). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{We study supervisor localization for real-time discrete-event systems
   (DES) in the Brandin-Wonham framework of timed supervisory control. We
   view a real-time DES as comprised of asynchronous agents which are
   coupled through imposed logical and temporal specifications; the essence
   of supervisor localization is the decomposition of monolithic (global)
   control action into local control strategies for these individual
   agents. This study extends our previous work on supervisor localization
   for untimed DES, in that monolithic timed control action typically
   includes not only disabling action as in the untimed case, but also
   ``clock preempting{''} action which enforces prescribed temporal
   behavior. The latter action is executed by a class of special events,
   called ``forcible{''} events; accordingly, we localize monolithic
   preemptive action with respect to these events. We demonstrate the new
   features of timed supervisor localization with a manufacturing cell case
   study and discuss a distributed control implementation. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{The paper studies the problem of making Getz's bicycle model traverse a
   strictly convex Jordan curve with bounded roll angle and bounded speed.
   The approach to solving this problem is based on the virtual holonomic
   constraint (VHC) method. Specifically, a VHC is enforced making the roll
   angle of the bicycle become a function of the bicycle's position along
   the curve. It is shown that the VHC can be automatically generated as a
   periodic solution of a scalar periodic differential equation, which we
   call virtual constraint generator. Finally, it is shown that if the
   curve is sufficiently long as compared to the height of the bicycle's
   center of mass and its wheel base, then the enforcement of a suitable
   VHC makes the bicycle traverse the curve with a steady-state speed
   profile which is periodic and independent of initial conditions. An
   outcome of this work is a proof that the constrained dynamics of a
   Lagrangian control system subject to a VHC are generally not Lagrangian.

Abstract = {{Wind turbines can, in principle, be operated to smooth wind power
   fluctuations by allowing wider variations in turbine speed and generator
   torque to store and release energy. This ability must be constrained by
   turbine speed and generator torque limits. To present, work in the
   literature is conceptual and does not indicate what extent of smoothing
   is possible before component limits are reached, nor does it quantify
   sensitivity to variations in the input wind speed. This paper introduces
   a method for quantifying how much wind variation a wind turbine can
   absorb in variable speed mode while still being guaranteed to operate
   within its component limits. One can apply this method to obtain the
   dependence of maximum tolerable wind disturbance on the smoothing time
   constant, and thus make design decisions. This paper shows that the
   analysis of torque speed intersections, as standardly applied in
   electric machine theory, is of limited use for studying power smoothing.
   The new conclusions and design choices made available by the proposed
   method are illustrated with a series of computation examples. The method
   is shown to agree asymptotically with two limiting cases that can be
   calculated based on torque-intersection analysis. The method is based on
   new theory for computing invariance kernels for nonlinear planar
   systems, and can be adapted to assess the robustness of other control

Abstract = {{Hydrophobins are small fungal proteins that are amphiphilic and have a
   strong tendency to assemble at interfaces. By taking advantage of this
   property, hydrophobins have been used for a number of applications: as
   affinity tags in protein purification, for protein immobilization, such
   as in foam stabilizers, and as dispersion agents for insoluble drug
   molecules. Here, we used site-directed mutagenesis to gain an
   understanding of the molecular basis of their properties. We especially
   focused on the role of charged amino acids in the structure of
   hydrophobins. For this purpose, fusion proteins consisting of
   Trichoderma reesei hydrophobin I (HFBI) and the green fluorescent
   protein (GFP) that contained various combinations of substitutions of
   charged amino acids (D30, K32, D40, D43, R45, K50) in the HFBI structure
   were produced. The effects of the introduced mutations on binding,
   oligomerization, and partitioning were characterized in an aqueous
   two-phase system. It was found that some substitutions caused better
   surface binding and reduced oligomerization, while some showed the
   opposite effects. However, all mutations decreased partitioning in
   surfactant systems, indicating that the different functions are not
   directly correlated and that partitioning is dependent on finely tuned
   properties of hydrophobins. This work shows that not all functions in
   self-assembly are connected in a predictable way and that a simple
   surfactant model for hydrophobin function is insufficient.}},

Abstract = {{The growth of industrial applications of artificial intelligence has
   raised the need for design tools to aid in the conception and
   implementation of such complex systems. The design of automated planning
   systems faces several engineering challenges including the proper
   modeling of the domain knowledge: the creation of a model that
   represents the problem to be solved, the world that surrounds the
   system, and the ways the system can interact with and change the world
   in order to solve the problem. Knowledge modeling in AI planning is a
   hard task that involves acquiring the system requirements and making
   design decisions that can determine the behavior and performance of the
   resulting system. In this paper we investigate how knowledge acquired
   during a post-design phase of modeling can be used to improve the
   prospective model. A post-design framework is introduced which combines
   a knowledge engineering tool and a virtual prototyping environment for
   the analysis and simulation of plans. This framework demonstrates that
   post-design analysis supports the discovery of missing requirements and
   can guide the model refinement cycle. We present three case studies
   using benchmark domains and eight state-of-the-art planners. Our results
   demonstrate that significant improvements in plan quality and an
   increase in planning speed of up to three orders of magnitude can be
   achieved through a careful post-design process. We argue that such a
   process is critical for the deployment of AI planning technology in
   real-world engineering applications. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Activity of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase APH(3')-Ia leads to
   resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics in pathogenic Gram-negative
   bacteria, and contributes to the clinical obsolescence of this class of
   antibiotics. One strategy to rescue compromised antibiotics such as
   aminoglycosides is targeting the enzymes that confer resistance with
   small molecules. We demonstrated previously that ePK (eukaryotic protein
   kinase) inhibitors could inhibit APH enzymes, owing to the structural
   similarity between these two enzyme families. However, limited
   structural information of enzyme inhibitor complexes hindered
   interpretation of the results. In addition, cross-reactivity of
   compounds between APHs and ePKs represents an obstacle to their use as
   aminoglycoside adjuvants to rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity.
   In the present study, we structurally and functionally characterize
   inhibition of APH(3')-Ia by three diverse chemical scaffolds,
   anthrapyrazolone, 4-anilinoquinazoline and PP (pyrazolopyrimidine), and
   reveal distinctions in the binding mode of anthrapyrazolone and PP
   compounds to APH(3')-Ia compared with ePKs. Using this observation, we
   identify PP derivatives that select against ePKs, attenuate APH(3')-Ia
   activity and rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity against a
   resistant Escherichia coli strain. The structures described in the
   present paper and the inhibition studies provide an important
   opportunity for structure-based design of compounds to target
   aminoglycoside phosphotransferases for inhibition, potentially
   overcoming this form of antibiotic resistance.}},

Abstract = {{The self-centering energy dissipative (SCED) brace is a new steel
   bracing member that provides both damping to the structure and a
   re-centering capability. The goal of this study was to confirm the
   behavior of SCED braces within complete structural systems and to
   confirm the ability to model these systems with both a state-of-the-art
   computer model as well as a simplified model that would be useful to
   practicing engineers. To these ends, a three-story SCED-braced frame was
   designed and constructed for testing on a shake table. Two concurrent
   computer models of the entire frame were constructed: one using the
   opensees nonlinear dynamic modeling software, and a simplified model
   using the commercial structural analysis software sap2000. The frame
   specimen was subjected to 12 significant earthquakes without any
   adjustment or modification between the tests. The SCED braces prevented
   residual drifts in the frame, as designed, and did not show any
   significant degradation due to wear. Both numerical models were able to
   predict the drifts, story shears, and column forces well. Peak story
   accelerations were overestimated in the models; this effect was found to
   be caused by the absence of transitions at stiffness changes in the
   hysteretic model of the braces. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley \& Sons,

Abstract = {{The field of energy textiles is growing but continues to face two main
   challenges: (1) flexible energy storage does not yet exist in a form
   that is directly comparable with everyday fabrics including their feel,

   as part of a garment, it must be fabricated in a systematic manner
   allowing for multiple components of e-textiles to be integrated
   simultaneously. To help address these issues, we have developed textile
   supercapacitors based on knitted carbon fibers and activated carbon ink.
   We show capacitances as high as 0.51 F cm(-2) per device at 10 mV s(-1),
   which is directly comparable with those of standard activated carbon
   film electrodes tested under the same conditions. We also demonstrate
   the performance of the device when bent at 90 degrees, 135 degrees, 180
   degrees and when stretched. This is the first report on knitting as a
   fabrication technique for integrated energy storage devices.}},

Abstract = {{Multicopper oxidases can act on a broad spectrum of phenolic and
   non-phenolic compounds. These enzymes include laccases, which are widely
   distributed in plants and fungi, and were more recently identified in
   bacteria. Here, we present the results of biochemical and mutational
   studies of small laccase (SLAC), a multicopper oxidase from Streptomyces
   coelicolor (SCO6712). In addition to typical laccase substrates, SLAC
   was tested using phenolic compounds that exhibit antioxidant activity.
   SLAC showed oxidase activity against 12 of 23 substrates tested,
   including caffeic acid, ferulic acid, resveratrol, quercetin, morin,
   kaempferol and myricetin. The kinetic parameters of SLAC were determined
   for 2,2'azino- bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid),
   2,6-dimethoxyphenol, quercetin, morin and myricetin, and maximum
   reaction rates were observed with myricetin, where kcat and Km values at
   60 degrees C were 8.1 (+/- 0.8) s-1 and 0.9 (+/- 0.3) mM respectively.
   SLAC had a broad pH optimum for activity (between pH 4 and 8) and
   temperature optimum at 60-70 degrees C. It demonstrated remarkable
   thermostability with a half-life of over 10 h at 80 degrees C and over 7
   h at 90 degrees C. Site-directed mutagenesis revealed 17 amino acid
   residues important for SLAC activity including the 10 His residues
   involved in copper coordination. Most notably, the Y229A and Y230A
   mutant proteins showed over 10-fold increase in activity compared with
   the wildtype SLAC, which was correlated to higher copper incorporation,
   while kinetic analyses with S929A predicts localization of this residue
   near the metaposition of aromatic substrates.}},

Abstract = {{Post-mortem studies have demonstrated alterations in superficial white
   matter (SWM) in schizophrenia patients. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   can be used to assess SWM in vivo, and compare SWM fractional anisotropy
   (FA) in schizophrenia patients vs healthy controls. The assessment of
   SWM in vivo also provides an opportunity to identify novel neural
   correlates of cognitive performance, and potential cognitive impairment
   in schizophrenia patients. Forty-four patients with schizophrenia and 44
   matched healthy controls underwent neuroimaging and cognitive protocols.
   Using an SWM mask and tract-based spatial statistics, differences in
   SWM-FA were examined between groups. SWM-FA clusters different between
   groups were then used to predict cognitive performance with multiple
   linear regression. The relative contribution of SWM fiber subtypes (deep
   white matter extensions vs U-fibers and intraregional fibers) from
   significantly different clusters was examined. Compared to controls,
   patients with schizophrenia had reduced FA in five SWM clusters: the
   largest a left posterior parieto-occipital cluster, followed by four
   clusters in the left frontal lobe. SWM-FA in the frontal lobe clusters
   predicted attention, working memory, and processing speed performance in
   healthy controls, but not in patients with schizophrenia. The majority
   of streamlines tracked from these clusters were restricted to U-fibers
   and intraregional fibers, rather than deep white matter extensions. Our
   analyses revealed prominent SWM disruption in patients with
   schizophrenia compared to controls. SWM-cognition relationships shown in
   healthy individuals were disrupted in patients with schizophrenia. SWM
   may be an important neurobiological substrate of cognitive performance
   and a novel cortical treatment target for cognitive deficits in
   schizophrenia patients.}},

Abstract = {{This study shows the development of new polymeric open-cell foams from
   polypropylene (PP) and polylactide (PLA) resins with a focus on sound
   absorption properties and modeling of these foams. The objective is to
   develop new environmentally friendly foams to replace the existing
   non-recyclable Polyurethane foams are currently used for sound
   insulation in industry. Through this research, open-cell foams of about
   90\% porosity were fabricated from PP and PLA. These resins were
   selected since PP is a recyclable thermoplastic polymer, and PLA is a
   bio-based thermoplastic polymer made from renewable resources.
   Polyurethane (PU) foam which is currently used for sound absorption and
   noise control in industry was compared to the fabricated PP and PLA
   foams. As the first attempt to fabricate environmentally friendly
   acoustic foams, the resulting foam structures show improved properties
   as compared to the existing materials. The average absorption of PP and
   PLA foams fabricated is in the range of 0.42-0.55 which is comparable or
   even higher than the average absorption of PU foam. To better understand
   the effect of structural and material properties on sound absorption and
   further improve the acoustic performance of bio-based foams, an
   analytical model based on Johnson-Champoux-Allard model was used to
   numerically simulate the acoustic performance of foams under study.

Abstract = {{Principal component analysis (PCA)-based neural network (NNet) models of
   HfO2 thin films are used to study the process of efficient model
   selection and develop an improved model by using multivariate functional
   data such as X-ray diffraction data (XRD). The accumulation capacitance
   and the hysteresis index input parameters, both characteristic of HfO2
   dielectric films, were selected for the inclusion in the model by
   analyzing the process conditions. Standardized XRD were used to analyze
   the characteristic variations for different process conditions; the
   responses and the electrical properties were predicted by NNet modeling
   using crystallinity-based measurement data. A Bayesian information
   criterion (BIC) was used to compare the model efficiency and to select
   an improved model for response prediction. Two conclusions summarize the
   results of the research documented in this paper: (i) physical or
   material properties can be predicted by the PCA-based NNet model using
   large-dimension data, and (ii) BIC can be used for the selection and
   evaluation of predictive models in semiconductor manufacturing

   Intrinsic Multifunctional Nanovesicles}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2013}},

Abstract = {{We recently developed porphysomes as intrinsically multifunctional
   nanovesicles. A photosensitizer, pyropheophorbide a, was conjugated to a
   phospholipid and then self-assembled to liposome-like spherical
   vesicles. Due to the extremely high density of porphyrin in the
   porphyrin-lipid bilayer, porphysomes generated large extinction
   coefficients, structure-dependent fluorescence self-quenching, and
   excellent photothermal efficacy. In our formulation, porphysomes were
   synthesized using high pressure extrusion, and displayed a mean particle
   size around 120 nm. Twenty-four hr post-intravenous injection of
   porphysomes, the local temperature of the tumor increased from 30
   degrees C to 62 degrees C rapidly upon one minute exposure of 750 mW
   (1.18 W/cm(2)), 671 nm laser irradiation. Following the complete thermal
   ablation of the tumor, eschars formed and healed within 2 weeks, while
   in the control groups the tumors continued to grow and all reached the
   defined end point within 3 weeks. These data show how porphysomes can be
   used as potent photothermal therapy (PTT) agents.}},

Abstract = {{Transient pressure associated with a rapidly filling pipeline containing
   two entrapped air pockets is investigated experimentally and
   numerically. A multiple-air-pocket elastic-water model considering
   multiple moving boundaries of water columns is developed by neglecting
   inertia and head loss of a short water column near air-water interfaces.
   The proposed model is validated by experimental data. Results show that
   when two air pockets in length are much different, the maximum pressure
   always arises in the smaller air pocket regardless of the blocking
   column's length. The case of the upstream air pocket with a similar
   length to the downstream is the most complicated and dangerous because
   (1)the maximum pressure may alternately arise in two air pockets as the
   blocking column increases, and (2)interaction of two air pockets could
   cause a huge pressure surge, which is likely much higher than with only
   one air pocket. The existing single-air-pocket model cannot effectively
   simulate pressure surge of the two air pockets.}},

Abstract = {{The ability of the human body to naturally recover from coronary heart
   disease is limited because cardiac cells are terminally differentiated,
   have low proliferation rates, and low turn-over rates. Cardiovascular
   tissue engineering offers the potential for production of cardiac tissue
   ex vivo, but is currently limited by several challenges: (i) Tissue
   engineering constructs require pure populations of seed cells, (ii)
   Fabrication of 3-D geometrical structures with features of the same
   length scales that exist in native tissue is non-trivial, and (iii)
   Cells require stimulation from the appropriate biological, electrical
   and mechanical factors. In this review, we summarize the current state
   of microfluidic techniques for enrichment of subpopulations of cells
   required for cardiovascular tissue engineering, which offer unique
   advantages over traditional plating and FACS/MACS-based enrichment. We
   then summarize modern techniques for producing tissue engineering
   scaffolds that mimic native cardiac tissue. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All

Title = {{Magnetic and interface microstructure contribution to bulk specific heat

Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{The bulk specific heat of fully dense nanocrystalline Ni-P
   electrodeposits with essentially constant P content (about 4 at\%) and
   varying average grain sizes from 6.9 to 28.9 nm was investigated using
   modulated differential scanning calorimetry. In the lower temperature
   range from room temperature to 120 A degrees C, at which the
   as-deposited sample microstructure was thermally stable, the bulk
   specific heat varied only within similar to 2 \% despite the substantial
   variation of interface volume fractions from 0.11 to 0.39 for this
   series of samples. Moreover, the measured bulk specific heat values of
   the Ni-P samples were all located within the reported specific heat
   value range for conventional polycrystalline Ni. Evidently, the
   contribution due to grain size-related interface excess free volume is
   negligible and the bulk specific heat for the materials can be
   characterized as a structure-insensitive property. In the elevated
   temperature range from 150 A degrees C to the Curie temperature of 357 A
   degrees C, the magnetic contribution to the specific heat was
   significantly influenced by the chemical environment of P in the Ni-P
   samples. When P atoms were in the form of supersaturated solution in the
   nickel matrix, a complete suppression of the characteristic lambda peak
   of the magnetic contribution in the specific heat curves was observed
   for all materials. The lambda peak re-appeared in the specific heat
   curve after the Ni-P sample underwent a transformation to a two-phase
   microstructure consisting of Ni and Ni3P grains. It can be concluded
   that at a given P content, paramagnetic phosphorus atoms in the form of
   solutes are more effective in reducing the magnetic contributions to the
   specific heat than the form of paramagnetic Ni3P second-phase particles
   for the nanocrystalline Ni-P alloy.}},

Abstract = {{Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been shown to ablate tumors within
   vertebral bone and yield short-term improvements in vertebral
   architecture and biomechanical strength, in particular when combined
   with bisphosphonate (BP) treatment. Longer-term outcomes of PDT combined
   with current treatments for skeletal metastases are essential to
   understand its therapeutic potential. The objective of this study is to
   evaluate the response of vertebrae to PDT after a longer (6-week) time
   period, alone and combined with previous BP or radiation treatment (RT).
   Sixty-three female rnu/rnu rats were randomized to six treatment groups:
   untreated control, BP-only, RT-only, PDT-only, combined BP+PDT and
   combined RT+PDT. L2 vertebrae were structurally analyzed through mu
   CT-based analysis, axial compressive load-to-failure testing and
   histological analysis of morphology, osteoid formation and osteoclast
   activity. Combined BP+PDT treatment yielded the largest improvements in
   bone architecture with combined RT+PDT treatment yielding similar
   findings, but of a lesser magnitude. Mechanically, ultimate force and
   stress were correlated to stereological parameters that demonstrated a
   positive structural effect from combinatory treatment. Increased osteoid
   formation was observed in both combination therapies without any
   significant differences in osteoclast activity. Overall, multimodality
   treatment demonstrated a sustained positive effect on vertebral
   structural integrity, motivating PDT as a minimally-invasive adjuvant
   treatment for spinal metastases. (c) 2012 Orthopaedic Research Society

Abstract = {{The fluence map optimization (FMO) problem is a core problem in
   intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) treatment planning.
   Although it has been studied extensively for site-specific treatment
   planning, few studies have examined efficient computational methods for
   solving it for intensity modulated total marrow irradiation (IM-TMI)
   planning; few studies have also looked at exploiting prior beamlet
   information to solve the FMO problem in a beam orientation optimization
   context. In this study, we consider different types of line search
   strategies and different types of warm-start techniques to improve the
   speed with which the FMO problem for IM-TMI is solved and the quality of
   the end solution. We also consider a parallelism-enhanced algorithm to
   solve the FMO problem for IM-TMI treatment planning with a large number
   of beams (36 equispaced beams at each of 11 isocenters, for a total of
   396 beams). We show that the backtracking line search strategy with step
   reduction exhibits the best performance and that using either of the two
   types of warm-start techniques which we consider leads to significant
   improvements in both solution time and quality. We also provide results
   for the aforementioned 396-beam plan and show that 30-beam solutions
   obtained using beam orientation optimization attain a comparable level
   of quality as this larger solution. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{This article considers a repair shop that fixes failed components from
   different k-out-of-n:G systems. It is assumed that each system consists
   of the same type of component; to increase availability, a certain
   number of critical components are stocked as spare parts. A shared
   inventory that serves all systems and/or reserved inventories for each
   system are allowed; this is called a hybrid model. Additionally, two
   alternative dispatching rules for the repaired component are considered.
   The destination for a repaired component can be chosen either on a
   first-come first-served basis or by following a static priority rule.
   The analysis gives the steady-state system size distribution of the two
   alternative models at the repair shop. Numerical examples are performed
   that minimize the spare parts held while subjecting the availability of
   each system to exceed a targeted value. It is shown that a hybrid
   priority policy is better than a hybrid first-come first-served policy,
   unless the availabilities of systems are close.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose the new one- and three-dimensional models for
   the description of hysteretic phenomena in shape memory alloys (SMAs).
   These thermodynamic models are non-isothermal and allow to account for
   the thermo-mechanical material properties of both austenite and
   martensite phases based on the local phase value of the order parameter.
   They are based on the Ginzburg-Landau free energy and the phase field
   theory. The core of the models is a phase evolution governed by the time
   dependent Ginzburg-Landau (TDGL) equation and the conservation balance
   laws with nonlinear coupling between stress, strain and the phase order
   parameter. The models account for the gradient energy and have been
   tested in the study of material properties evolution under harmonic
   stress loading for all important practical cases. The representative
   numerical simulations have been carried out here without the gradient
   energy term. The developed models account for the phase dependent
   properties based on the compliance tensor as a function of the order
   parameter and stress. We also compared the results obtained with these
   models and observed differences in homogeneous and inhomogeneous
   situations due to the change in compliance. In this way, the description
   of quasiplastic and pseudoelastic behaviors in SMA specimens is improved
   and becomes in an agreement with existing experiments. (C) 2013 Elsevier

Abstract = {{This paper introduces a hardware-efficient digital controller integrated
   circuit (IC) for single- and two-phase dc-dc converters that recovers
   from load transients with virtually minimum possible output voltage
   deviation. In steady state, the IC behaves as a conventional
   voltage-mode pulsewidth modulation controller. During load changes, it
   enters transient suppression mode that utilizes a simple algorithm,
   requiring no knowledge of the converter parameters and virtually no
   processing power, to seamlessly recover back to the steady state without
   exposing components to a high-current stress. To further minimize the
   area and power consumption of the IC, an asynchronous track-and-hold
   analog-to-digital converter (ADC) is developed. The ADC utilizes only
   one preamplifier and four comparators having approximately ten times
   smaller silicon area and power consumption than a comparable windowed
   flash ADC. To compensate effects of converter losses and system delays
   on the controller operation, the IC also incorporates duty ratio
   correction logic and dual-extreme point-based detection. The entire IC
   is implemented in a CMOS 0.18-mu m process on a 0.26-mm(2) silicon area,
   which is comparable to the state-of-the-art analog solutions. The
   functionality of the controller is tested with both single- and
   two-phase commercial 12-1.8 V, 500-kHz 60/120-W buck converter power
   stages. The results demonstrate seamless transition to the steady state
   with virtually minimum output voltage deviation. For the experimental
   system, this deviation is about four times smaller than that of a fast
   PID compensator having a one-tenth of the switching frequency bandwidth.}},

Title = {{BayMiR: inferring evidence for endogenous miRNA-induced gene repression
   from mRNA expression profiles}},
Journal = {{BMC GENOMICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{AUG 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: Popular miRNA target prediction techniques use sequence
   features to determine the functional miRNA target sites. These
   techniques commonly ignore the cellular conditions in which miRNAs
   interact with their targets in vivo. Gene expression data are rich
   resources that can complement sequence features to take into account the
   context dependency of miRNAs.
   Results: We introduce BayMiR, a new computational method, that predicts
   the functionality of potential miRNA target sites using the activity
   level of the miRNAs inferred from genome-wide mRNA expression profiles.
   We also found that mRNA expression variation can be used as another
   predictor of functional miRNA targets. We benchmarked BayMiR, the
   expression variation, Cometa, and the TargetScan ``context scores{''} on
   two tasks: predicting independently validated miRNA targets and
   predicting the decrease in mRNA abundance in miRNA overexpression
   assays. BayMiR performed better than all other methods in both
   benchmarks and, surprisingly, the variation index performed better than
   Cometa and some individual determinants of the TargetScan context
   scores. Furthermore, BayMiR predicted miRNA target sets are more
   consistently annotated with GO and KEGG terms than similar sized random
   subsets of genes with conserved miRNA seed regions. BayMiR gives higher
   scores to target sites residing near the poly(A) tail which strongly
   favors mRNA degradation using poly(A) shortening. Our work also suggests
   that modeling multiplicative interactions among miRNAs is important to
   predict endogenous mRNA targets.
   Conclusions: We develop a new computational method for predicting the
   target mRNAs of miRNAs. BayMiR applies a large number of mRNA expression
   profiles and successfully identifies the mRNA targets and miRNA
   activities without using miRNA expression data. The BayMiR package is
   publicly available and can be readily applied to any mRNA expression
   data sets.}},

Title = {{QHREDGS Enhances Tube Formation, Metabolism and Survival of Endothelial
   Cells in Collagen-Chitosan Hydrogels}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG 27}},
Abstract = {{Cell survival in complex, vascularized tissues, has been implicated as a
   major bottleneck in advancement of therapies based on cardiac tissue
   engineering. This limitation motivates the search for small, inexpensive
   molecules that would simultaneously be cardio-protective and
   vasculogenic. Here, we present peptide sequence QHREDGS, based upon the
   fibrinogen-like domain of angiopoietin-1, as a prime candidate molecule.
   We demonstrated previously that QHREDGS improved cardiomyocyte
   metabolism and mitigated serum starved apoptosis. In this paper we
   further demonstrate the potency of QHREDGS in its ability to enhance
   endothelial cell survival, metabolism and tube formation. When
   endothelial cells were exposed to the soluble form of QHREDGS,
   improvements in endothelial cell barrier functionality, nitric oxide
   production and cell metabolism (ATP levels) in serum starved conditions
   were found. The functionality of the peptide was then examined when
   conjugated to collagen-chitosan hydrogel, a potential carrier for in
   vivo application. The presence of the peptide in the hydrogel mitigated
   paclitaxel induced apoptosis of endothelial cells in a dose dependent
   manner. Furthermore, the peptide modified hydrogels stimulated tube-like
   structure formation of encapsulated endothelial cells. When integrin
   alpha v beta 3 or alpha 5 beta 1were antibody blocked during cell
   encapsulation in peptide modified hydrogels, tube formation was
   abolished. Therefore, the dual protective nature of the novel peptide
   QHREDGS may position this peptide as an appealing augmentation for
   collagen-chitosan hydrogels that could be used for biomaterial delivered
   cell therapies in the settings of myocardial infarction.}},

Volume = {{88}},

Month = {{AUG 19}},
Abstract = {{Space platforms such as the Space Shuttle and International Space
   Station have been considered an ideal environment for production of
   protein and semiconductor crystals of superior quality due to the
   negligible gravity-induced convection. Although it was believed that
   under microgravity environment diffusive mass transport would dominate
   the growth of the crystals, some related experiments have not shown
   satisfactory results possibly due to the movement of the growing
   crystals in fluid cells caused by small vibrations present in the space
   platforms called g-jitter. In ground-based experiments, there have been
   clear observations of attraction and repulsion of a solid particle with
   respect to a nearby wall of the fluid cell due to small vibrations. The
   present work is a numerical investigation on the physical mechanisms
   responsible for the repulsion force, which has been predicted to
   increase with the cell vibration frequency and amplitude, as well as the
   fluid viscosity. Moreover, the simulations have revealed that the
   repulsion force occurs mostly due to the increased pressure in the
   narrow gap between the particle and the nearest wall.}},

Title = {{Dynamic Simulation and Metabolome Analysis of Long-Term Erythrocyte
   Storage in Adenine-Guanosine Solution}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{8}},

Month = {{AUG 16}},
Abstract = {{Although intraerythrocytic ATP and 2,3-bisphophoglycerate (2,3-BPG) are
   known as direct indicators of the viability of preserved red blood cells
   and the efficiency of post-transfusion oxygen delivery, no current blood
   storage method in practical use has succeeded in maintaining both these
   metabolites at high levels for long periods. In this study, we
   constructed a mathematical kinetic model of comprehensive metabolism in
   red blood cells stored in a recently developed blood storage solution
   containing adenine and guanosine, which can maintain both ATP and
   2,3-BPG. The predicted dynamics of metabolic intermediates in
   glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and purine salvage pathway
   were consistent with time-series metabolome data measured with capillary
   electrophoresis time-of-flight mass spectrometry over 5 weeks of
   storage. From the analysis of the simulation model, the metabolic roles
   and fates of the 2 major additives were illustrated: (1) adenine could
   enlarge the adenylate pool, which maintains constant ATP levels
   throughout the storage period and leads to production of metabolic
   waste, including hypoxanthine; (2) adenine also induces the consumption
   of ribose phosphates, which results in 2,3-BPG reduction, while (3)
   guanosine is converted to ribose phosphates, which can boost the
   activity of upper glycolysis and result in the efficient production of
   ATP and 2,3-BPG. This is the first attempt to clarify the underlying
   metabolic mechanism for maintaining levels of both ATP and 2,3-BPG in
   stored red blood cells with in silico analysis, as well as to analyze
   the trade-off and the interlock phenomena between the benefits and
   possible side effects of the storage-solution additives.}},

Journal = {{CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{230}},
Pages = {{80-92}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{This study evaluates the effect of ammonia gas addition on synthesis
   environment and surface chemistry of single-walled carbon nanotubes
   (SWCNTs) produced by induction thermal plasma system (ITP). The
   experiments were carried out based on the opposed-flow injection of
   ammonia into the LIP reactor used for mass production of SWCNTs
   containing soot. The influence of in situ ammonia injection on the SWCNT
   final products was closely examined by Raman spectroscopy at three
   wavelengths, coupled thermogravimetry-infrared spectroscopy (TG-FTIR)
   and solid-phase infrared spectroscopy. The results clearly indicated the
   surface modification of SWCNTs where the metallic tubes had a greater
   tendency than the semiconducting tubes to react with ammonia at high
   temperature. To better understand the reaction system and predict the
   concentration profile of the intermediates and the product species from
   thermal decomposition of ammonia in the ITP reactor, a numerical
   simulation was developed including both the detailed kinetic of ammonia
   decomposition and turbulent mixing in the reaction system. By comparing
   the experimental and simulation results, a two-step reaction mechanism
   is suggested for this in situ SWCNTs chemistry in which the reaction of
   atomic hydrogen and amidogen radicals with SWCNTs, is followed by the
   ammonia chemisorption. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{454}},
Number = {{1}},
Pages = {{157-166}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Several members of the C-C MCP (meta-cleavage product) hydrolase family
   demonstrate an unusual ability to hydrolyse esters as well as the MCPs
   (including those from mono- and bi-cyclic aromatics). Although the
   molecular mechanisms responsible for such substrate promiscuity are
   starting to emerge, the full understanding of these complex enzymes is
   far from complete. In the present paper, we describe six distinct
   alpha/beta hydrolases identified through genomic approaches, four of
   which demonstrate the unprecedented characteristic of activity towards a
   broad spectrum of substrates, including p-nitrophenyl, halogenated,
   fatty acyl, aryl, glycerol, cinnamoyl and carbohydrate esters, lactones,
   2-hydroxy-6-oxo-6-phenylhexa-2,4-dienoate and
   2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoate. Using structural analysis and
   site-directed mutagenesis we have identified the three residues
   (Ser(32), Val(130) and Trp(144)) that determine the unusual substrate
   specificity of one of these proteins, CCSP0084. The results may open up
   new research avenues into comparative catalytic models, structural and
   mechanistic studies, and biotechnological applications of MCP
   hydrolases.}},

Title = {{Towards a multimodal brain-computer interface: Combining fNIRS and fTCD
   measurements to enable higher classification accuracy}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{77}},
Pages = {{186-194}},
Month = {{AUG 15}},
Abstract = {{Previous brain-computer interface (BCI) research has largely focused on
   single neuroimaging modalities such as near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)
   or transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD). However, multimodal
   brain-computer interfaces, which combine signals from different brain
   modalities, have been suggested as a potential means of improving the
   accuracy of BCI systems. In this paper, we compare the classification
   accuracies attainable using NIRS signals alone, TCD signals alone, and a
   combination of NIRS and TCD signals. Nine able-bodied subjects (mean age
   = 25.7) were recruited and simultaneous measurements were made with NIRS
   and TCD instruments while participants were prompted to perform a verbal
   fluency task or to remain at rest, within the context of a
   block-stimulus paradigm. Using Linear Discriminant Analysis, the verbal
   fluency task was classified at mean accuracies of 76.1 +/- 9.9\%, 79.4
   +/- 10.3\%, and 86.5 +/- 6.0\% using NIRS, TCD, and NIRS-TCD systems
   respectively. In five of nine participants, classification accuracies
   with the NIRS-TCD system were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than with
   NIRS or TCD systems alone. Our results suggest that multimodal
   neuroimaging may be a promising method of improving the accuracy of
   future brain-computer interfaces. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Evaluation of an intelligent wheelchair system for older adults with
   cognitive impairments}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{AUG 7}},
Abstract = {{Background: Older adults are the most prevalent wheelchair users in
   Canada. Yet, cognitive impairments may prevent an older adult from being
   allowed to use a powered wheelchair due to safety and usability
   concerns. To address this issue, an add-on Intelligent Wheelchair System
   (IWS) was developed to help older adults with cognitive impairments
   drive a powered wheelchair safely and effectively. When attached to a
   powered wheelchair, the IWS adds a vision-based anti-collision feature
   that prevents the wheelchair from hitting obstacles and a navigation
   assistance feature that plays audio prompts to help users manoeuvre
   around obstacles.
   Methods: A two stage evaluation was conducted to test the efficacy of
   the IWS. Stage One: Environment of Use - the IWS's anti-collision and
   navigation features were evaluated against objects found in a long-term
   care facility. Six different collision scenarios (wall, walker, cane, no
   object, moving and stationary person) and three different navigation
   scenarios (object on left, object on right, and no object) were
   performed. Signal detection theory was used to categorize the response
   of the system in each scenario. Stage Two: User Trials - single-subject
   research design was used to evaluate the impact of the IWS on older
   adults with cognitive impairment. Participants were asked to drive a
   powered wheelchair through a structured obstacle course in two phases:
   1) with the IWS and 2) without the IWS. Measurements of safety and
   usability were taken and compared between the two phases. Visual
   analysis and phase averages were used to analyze the single-subject
   data.
   Results: Stage One: The IWS performed correctly for all environmental
   anti-collision and navigation scenarios. Stage Two: Two participants
   completed the trials. The IWS was able to limit the number of collisions
   that occurred with a powered wheelchair and lower the perceived workload
   for driving a powered wheelchair. However, the objective performance
   (time to complete course) of users navigating their environment did not
   improve with the IWS.
   Conclusions: This study shows the efficacy of the IWS in performing with
   a potential environment of use, and benefiting members of its desired
   user population to increase safety and lower perceived demands of
   powered wheelchair driving.}},

   in the asymptotic limit and 60 dB loss (286 km standard fiber) in the
   finite-key case with state-of-the-art detectors. Our general model can
   also be applied to other non-QKD experiments involving entanglement and

Abstract = {{In this study, in situ polymer-fibrillar blends of polypropylene
   (PP)/polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) are prepared. Dynamic oscillatory
   shear experiments confirm that the PTFE elongates into fibrils during
   blending and forms a physical network of entanglements in the melt which
   results in gel-like properties. Uniaxial extensional flow experiments
   show strain-induced hardening behaviour. CO2 solvency in the PP/PTFE
   fibrillar blend is enhanced due to the CO2-philic character of PTFE.
   Remarkably, adding only 0.3 wt\% of PTFE is sufficient to markedly
   enhance the CO2 sorption capacity of the matrix. Continuous foam
   extrusion of the in situ fibrillar blend reveals a three orders of
   magnitude increase in bubble density, a ten-fold increase in volume
   expansion ratio, and a marked broadening of the foaming window with
   respect to neat PP. These improvements are attributed to the
   simultaneous enhancement in CO2 solvency and strain-hardening behaviour
   of the melt in the in situ fibrillar blend. Crown Copyright (c) 2013

Journal = {{MATERIALS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{6}},
Number = {{8}},
Pages = {{3469-3481}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Accumulative Roll-Bonding (ARB) is one of the more recently developed
   techniques capable of producing bulk ultra-fine grained (ufg) metals.
   There are still many aspects of the behavior of ufg metals that lacks an
   in-depth understanding, such as a generalized view of the factors that
   govern the cyclic deformation mechanism(s). This study aims to advance
   the understanding of the cyclic deformation behavior of ufg metals
   through the systematic investigation of ARB processed aluminum upon
   cyclic loading. It was found that the cyclic softening response often
   reported for ufg metals is largely influenced by the microstructure
   stability as the cyclic softening response is facilitated by grain
   coarsening which becomes inhibited with highly stable microstructure. On
   one hand, shear bands resembling braids of dislocations trespassing
   multiple grains have been observed to operate for the accommodation of
   the imposed cyclic strain in cases where grain coarsening is largely
   restricted. On the other hand, it was found that the microstructure
   stability can be overcome at higher applied cyclic plastic strain
   levels, leading to grain coarsening and thus a cyclic softening
   response. The findings in this study have further confirmed that the
   cyclic softening behavior found in many ufg metals, which may be
   detrimental in practical applications, can be inhibited by improvements
   in the microstructure stability.}},

Abstract = {{The goal of this study was to investigate clinically relevant
   biomechanical conditions relating to the setup and alignment of
   knee-ankle-foot orthoses and the influence of these conditions on knee
   extension moments and orthotic stance control during gait. Knee moments
   were collected using an instrumented gait laboratory and concurrently a
   load transducer embedded at the knee-ankle-foot orthosis knee joint of
   four individuals with poliomyelitis. We found that knee extension
   Moments were not typically produced in late stance-phase of gait. Adding
   a dorsiflexion stop at the orthotic ankle significantly decreased the
   knee flexion moments in late stance-phase, while slightly flexing the
   knee in stance-phase had a variable effect. The findings suggest that
   where users of orthoses have problems initiating swing-phase flexion
   with stance control orthoses, an ankle dorsiflexion stop may be used to
   enhance function. Furthermore, the use of stance control knee joints
   that lock while under flexion may contribute to more inconsistent
   unlocking of the stance control orthosis during gait.}},

Abstract = {{Heart failure after a myocardial infarction continues to be a leading
   killer in the Western world. Currently, there are no therapies that
   effectively prevent or reverse the cardiac damage and negative left
   ventricular remodeling process that follows a myocardial infarction.
   Because the heart has limited regenerative capacity, there has been
   considerable effort to develop new therapies that could repair and
   regenerate the myocardium. Although cell transplantation alone was
   initially studied, more recently, tissue engineering strategies using
   biomaterial scaffolds have been explored. In this review, we cover the
   different approaches to engineering the myocardium, including cardiac
   patches, which are in vitro-engineered constructs of functional
   myocardium, and injectable scaffolds, which can either encourage
   endogenous repair and regeneration or act as vehicles to support the
   delivery of cells and other therapeutics. (C) 2013 Mayo Foundation for

Journal = {{OPTICAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Fiber optic strain sensors have significantly evolved and have reached
   their market maturity during the last decade. Their widely recognized
   advantages are high precision, long-term stability, and durability. In
   addition to these benefits, fiber optic (FO) techniques allow for
   affordable instrumentation of large areas of civil structures and
   infrastructure enabling global large-scale monitoring based on
   long-gauge sensors, and integrity monitoring based on distributed
   sensors. The FO techniques that enable these two approaches are based on
   fiber Bragg-gratings and Brillouin optical time-domain analysis. The aim
   of this paper is to present both FO techniques and both structural
   assessment approaches, and to validate them through large-scale
   applications. Although many other currently applied methods fail to
   detect the damage in real, on-site conditions, the presented approaches
   were proven to be suitable for damage detection and characterization,
   i.e., damage localization and, to certain extent, quantification. This
   is illustrated by two applications presented in detail in this paper:
   the first on a post-tensioned concrete bridge and the second on
   segmented concrete pipeline. (C) 2013 Society of Photo-Optical

Abstract = {{This article explores the investment implications of moving to
   low-carbon, climate-resilient infrastructure. It begins with analysis of
   gross fixed capital formation and decarbonisation trends to examine past
   performance of OECD countries in reducing GHG emissions from 1997 to
   2007. Many OECD countries made progress in decoupling GHG emissions from
   infrastructure investment in residential buildings, and to a lesser
   extent from power and industry, but increased efforts are required,
   especially in the transportation sector. The analysis highlights the
   need to accelerate the pace and scale of change to reverse GHG emission
   trends to bring into reach ambitious climate policy goals. It then
   assesses future global infrastructure needs under low-carbon and
   business-as-usual (BAU) global warming scenarios, and the incremental
   costs of going ``low-carbon{''} are estimated to be small relative to
   the magnitude of the BAU infrastructure investment needs. Global
   infrastructure needs for 2015-2020, including buildings and
   transportation vehicles, are approximately 6.7 trillion USD/year under
   BAU. Incremental costs of low-carbon infrastructure are of the order 70
   to +450 billion USD/year. Achieving climate resilient infrastructure may
   add costs, but there is potentially synergistic overlap with low-carbon
   attributes. Although estimates are incomplete, the technical and
   financial inter-dependency between infrastructure systems suggests the
   potential to generate infrastructure investment to support a ``virtuous
   cycle{''} of low-carbon growth. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{Dynamic topographical pattern classification of multichannel prefrontal
   NIRS signals}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEURAL ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{10}},
Number = {{4}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective. Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) is an optical imaging
   technique that has recently been considered for brain-computer interface
   (BCI) applications. To date, NIRS-BCI studies have primarily made use of
   temporal features of brain activity, derived from the time-course of
   optical signals measured from discrete locations, to differentiate
   mental states. However, functional brain imaging studies have indicated
   that the spatial distribution of haemodynamic activity is also rich in
   information. Thus, the progression of a response over both time and
   space may be valuable to brain state classification. In this paper, we
   investigate the implication of including spatiotemporal features in the
   single-trial classification of haemodynamic events for a two-class
   problem by exploiting this information from dynamic NIR topograms.
   Approach. The value of spatiotemporal information was explored through a
   comparative analysis of four different classification schemes performed
   on multichannel NIRS data collected from the prefrontal cortex during a
   mental arithmetic activation task and rest. Employing a linear
   discriminant classifier, data were analysed using spatiotemporal
   features, temporal features, and a collective pool of spatiotemporal and
   temporal features. We also considered a majority vote combination of
   three classifiers; each established using one of the above feature sets.
   Lastly, two separate task durations (20 and 10 s) were considered for
   feature extraction. Main results. With features from the longer task
   interval, the highest overall classification accuracy was achieved using
   the majority voting classifier (76.1 +/- 8.4\%), which was greater than
   the accuracy obtained using temporal features alone (73.5 +/- 8.5\%)
   (F-3,F-144 = 7.04, p = 0.0002). While results from the shorter task
   duration were lower overall, the classifier employing only
   spatiotemporal features (with an average accuracy of 67.9 +/- 9.3\%)
   achieved a higher average accuracy than the rate obtained using only
   temporal features (64.4 +/- 8.4\%) (F-3,F-144 = 18.58, p < 10(-4)).
   Significance. Collectively, these results suggest that spatiotemporal
   information can be of value in the analysis of functional NIRS data, and
   improved classification rates may be obtained in future NIRS-BCI
   applications with the inclusion of this information.}},
