Title = {{A digital microfluidic method for multiplexed cell-based apoptosis
   assays}},

Abstract = {{Digital microfluidics (DMF), a fluid-handling technique in which
   picolitre-microlitre droplets are manipulated electrostatically on an
   array of electrodes, has recently become popular for applications in
   chemistry and biology. DMF devices are reconfigurable, have no moving
   parts, and are compatible with conventional high-throughput screening
   infrastructure (e. g., multiwell plate readers). For these and other
   reasons, digital microfluidics has been touted as being a potentially
   useful new tool for applications in multiplexed screening. Here, we
   introduce the first digital microfluidic platform used to implement
   parallel-scale cell-based assays. A fluorogenic apoptosis assay for
   caspase-3 activity was chosen as a model system because of the
   popularity of apoptosis as a target for anti-cancer drug discovery
   research. Dose-response profiles of caspase-3 activity as a function of
   staurosporine concentration were generated using both the digital
   microfluidic method and conventional techniques (i.e., pipetting,
   aspiration, and 96-well plates.) As expected, the digital microfluidic
   method had a 33-fold reduction in reagent consumption relative to the
   conventional technique. Although both types of methods used the same
   detector (a benchtop multiwell plate reader), the data generated by the
   digital microfluidic method had lower detection limits and greater
   dynamic range because apoptotic cells were much less likely to
   de-laminate when exposed to droplet manipulation by DMF relative to
   pipetting/aspiration in multiwell plates. We propose that the techniques
   described here represent an important milestone in the development of
   digital microfluidics as a useful tool for parallel cell-based screening
   and other applications.}},

Abstract = {{Size-selective precipitation was used to successfully separate

   effect range of 1 S nm. This enabled the measurement of the absolute
   quantum yield and lifetime of photoluminescence of allylbenzene-capped
   silicon nanocrystals as a function of size. The absolute quantum yield
   and lifetime are found to monotonically decrease with decreasing
   nanocrystal size, which implies that nonradiative vibrational and
   surface defect effects overwhelm spatial confinement effects that favor
   radiative relaxation. Visible emission absolute quantum yields as high
   as 43\% speak well for the development of ``green{''} silicon
   nanocrystal color-tunable light emitting diodes that can potentially
   match the performance of their toxic heavy metal chalcogenide

Abstract = {{Nanoparticles are promising drug delivery systems whose selection and
   optimization can be gainfully conducted by theoretical methods. This
   review is targeted to experimentalists who are interested in enhancing
   their time and cost efficiency through the incorporation of theoretical
   approaches. This review thus begins with a brief overview of theoretical
   approaches available to the development of contemporary drug delivery
   systems. Approaches include solubility parameters, Flory-Huggins theory,
   analytical predictions of partition coefficients, and molecular
   simulations. These methods are then compared as they relate to the
   optimization of drug-material pairs using important performance-related
   parameters including the size of the delivery particles, their surface
   properties, and the compatibility of the materials with the drug to be
   sequestered. Next, this review explores contemporary efforts to optimize
   a selection of existing nanoparticle platforms, including nanoemulsions,
   linear and star-shaped block co-polymer micelles, and dendrimers. The
   review concludes with an outlook on the challenges remaining in the
   successful application of these theoretical methods to the development
   of new drug formulations.
   From the Clinical Editor: This paper is a comprehensive review of the
   many approaches available to assist the optimization of nanoparticle
   drug delivery vehicles, including a detailed discussion of
   methodological applicability, a survey of contemporary efforts to
   optimize a selection of frequently used nanoparticle subtypes. (C) 2012

Journal = {{NATURE MATERIALS}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Transition-metal oxides improve power conversion efficiencies in organic
   photovoltaics and are used as low-resistance contacts in organic
   light-emitting diodes and organic thin-film transistors. What makes
   metal oxides useful in these technologies is the fact that their
   chemical and electronic properties can be tuned to enable charge
   exchange with a wide variety of organic molecules. Although it is known
   that charge exchange relies on the alignment of donor and acceptor
   energy levels, the mechanism for level alignment remains under debate.
   Here, we conclusively establish the principle of energy alignment
   between oxides and molecules. We observe a universal energy-alignment
   trend for a set of transition-metal oxides-representing a broad
   diversity in electronic properties-with several organic semiconductors.
   The trend demonstrates that, despite the variance in their electronic
   properties, oxide energy alignment is governed by one driving force:
   electron-chemical-potential equilibration. Using a combination of simple
   thermodynamics, electrostatics and Fermi statistics we derive a
   mathematical relation that describes the alignment.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a joint trivariate discrete-continuous-continuous
   model for commuters' mode choice, work start time and work duration. The
   model is designed to capture correlations among random components
   influencing these decisions. For empirical investigation, the model is
   estimated using a data set collected in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA)
   in 2001. Considering the fact that work duration involves medium- to
   long-term decision making compared to short-term activity scheduling
   decisions, work duration is considered endogenous to work start time
   decisions. The empirical model reveals many behavioral details of
   commuters' mode choice, work start time and duration decisions. The
   primary objective of the model is to predict workers' work schedules
   according to mode choice, which is considered a skeletal activity
   schedule in activity-based travel demand models. However, the empirical
   model reveals many behavioral details of workers' mode choices and work
   scheduling. Independent application of the model for travel demand
   management policy evaluations is also promising, as it provides better
   value in terms of travel time estimates. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {{Integrating parking behaviour in activity-based travel demand modelling:

Abstract = {{Traditionally, the parking choice/option is considered to be an
   important factor in only in the mode choice component of a four-stage
   travel demand modelling system. However, travel demand modelling has
   been undergoing a paradigm shift from the traditional trip-based
   approach to an activity-based approach. The activity-based approach is
   intended to capture the influences of different policy variables at
   various stages of activity-travel decision making processes. Parking is
   a key policy variable that captures land use and transportation
   interactions in urban areas. It is important that the influences of
   parking choice on activity scheduling behaviour be identified fully.
   This paper investigates this issue using a sample data set collected in
   Montreal, Canada. Parking type choice and activity scheduling decision
   (start time choice) are modelled jointly in order to identify the
   effects of parking type choice on activity scheduling behaviour.
   Empirical investigation gives strong evidence that parking type choice
   influences activity scheduling process. The empirical findings of this
   investigation challenge the validity of the traditional conception which
   considers parking choice as exogenous variable only in the mode choice
   component of travel demand models. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   concentration is mainly attributed to the formation of Friedel's salt,
   C(3)A center dot CaCl(2)center dot 10H(2)O. When pastes originally
   exposed to high chloride concentrations are subsequently exposed to
   chloride-free solution, a portion of the bound chloride is released, but
   a significant portion remains irreversibly bound. There is some evidence
   that Friedel's salt may partially convert to Kuzel's salt, C(3)A center
   dot(0.5CaCl(2))(0.5CaSO(4))center dot 12H(2)O, under these conditions.
   The binding relationships were best described by the Freundlich isotherm
   and binding coefficients are given for all the binders tested. (C) 2011

Abstract = {{A polyaxial (true-triaxial) stress-loading system, developed originally
   for determining all nine components of P- and S-wave velocities and
   attenuation and fluid permeability for 50.8 mm-side cubic rock specimens
   tested to failure, has been modified to permit the measurement of
   acoustic emission events associated with the failure process. Results
   are reported for Crosland Hill sandstone tested to failure under loading
   conditions leading to the formation of sets of aligned microcracks,
   achieved by maintaining the minor principal stress at a low value while
   increasing the two other principal stresses until failure of the rock.
   An ultrasonic survey associated with the test has been employed to map
   the transversely-isotropic velocity structure created by through-going
   parallel fractures resulting from the sets of aligned microcracks. This
   velocity structure has then been employed to locate acoustic emission
   events recorded during the test by four acoustic emission sensors
   located in each of the six specimen loading platens. A selection of
   acoustic emission events associated with one of the fractures has been
   processed for moment tensor analysis information, in order to determine
   the source type and orientation of microcracking as the fracture grows.
   The mechanisms indicate tensile behaviour during initial fracture
   propagation. Shear failure, however, appears to dominate as the fracture
   finally approaches the opposite face of the cubic specimen. The work
   presented here has, in part, led to the development of new rock testing
   systems and geophysical monitoring and processing technologies that will
   enable laboratory study of rock behaviour under conditions better
   resembling those experienced in situ.}},

Abstract = {{The trend of current brain computer interfaces (BCI) seek to establish
   bi-directional communication with the brain, for instance, recovering
   motor functions by externally controlling devices and directly
   stimulating the brain. This will greatly assist paralyzed individuals
   through bypassing the damaged brain region. The key process of this
   communication interface is to decode movements from neural signals and
   encode information into neural activity. The majority of decoding or
   pattern classification studies have focused on cortical areas for BCIs,
   but deep brain structures have also been involved in motor control. The
   subthalamic nucleus (STN) in the basal ganglia is involved in the
   preparation, execution and imagining of movements, and may be an
   alternative source for driving BCIs. This study therefore aimed to
   classify patterns of deep brain local field potentials (LFPs) related to
   execution of visually cued movements. LFPs were recorded bilaterally
   from the STN through deep brain stimulation electrodes implanted in
   patients with Parkinson's disease. The frequency dependent components of
   the LFPs were extracted using the wavelet packet transform. In each
   frequency component, signal features were extracted using an alternative
   approach called neural synchronization by analyzing Granger causality
   between the STN. Based on these extracted features, a new feature
   selection strategy, namely weighted sequential feature selection (WSFS)
   was developed to efficiently select the optimal feature subset. A
   support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented alongside this
   novel feature extraction and selection strategy, and evaluated using a
   cross-validation procedure. Using this optimised feature subset, average
   correct pattern classification accuracy of movement (left or right)
   reached 76.0 +/- 3.1\%. The results obtained in this study are
   encouraging and suggest that the neural activity in the deep neural
   circuit (basal ganglia) can be used for controlling BCIs.}},

Abstract = {{This paper introduces novel functional electrical stimulation (FES)
   system architecture. Compared to the existing state of the art solutions
   {[}1]-{[}15], the presented FES system drastically increases variety of
   stimulation pulses, results in a less painful therapy and has
   significantly lower power consumption. Furthermore, the FES system
   inherently provides zero net charge of stimulated tissue eliminating the
   need for a dedicated discharging circuit. The key element of the FES is
   a novel power stage merging a flyback and switch- capacitor (SC)
   converters. The flyback steps up battery voltage and provides galvanic
   isolation. The following SC stage produces zero net charge high slew-
   rate pulses reducing pain sensation. The control of the output current
   pulses is performed through integrated digital voltage- programmed
   current mode control.
   The new FES system was tested with able bodied individuals. The results
   show that it produces pulses with a 10 ns rise time, which compared to
   other known solutions, result in the same muscle force output for 30+\%
   less stimulation energy. The results also show that the presented FES
   system requires 60\% less energy compared to other known systems
   allowing longer battery life in portable applications.}},

Abstract = {{Synchronous generators (SGs) are the major contributors in maintaining
   the stability of power systems. As SGs are displaced by
   electronically-coupled distributed energy resources (DERs), the dynamic
   behaviour of these new generation technologies will become critical in
   ensuring grid stability. One method of ensuring continued provision of
   voltage and frequency regulation is to have these new devices emulate
   the response of traditional SGs. Achieving the desired emulation
   behaviour requires fast, robust control of DERs to track the rapid
   changes in current injections that arise when SGs are subjecting to
   changing grid conditions. Hence, this paper focuses on the feasibility
   of controlling a voltage source converter to emulate the behaviour of a
   SG during both steady-state and transient periods. Two types of
   hysteresis current controllers (HCCs)-standard and space vector
   based-are considered for tracking the current injections of a virtual SG
   in real-time. Through simulation, it is demonstrated that both HCCs
   provide robust, fast tracking that enables the desired emulation, but
   they exhibit a wide range of variations in switching frequencies. Hence,
   this paper proposes a dead-time control method and demonstrates that the
   switching frequencies can be limited while maintaining the quality of
   voltages and currents that are compatible to the IEEE 1547 standard.}},

Abstract = {{This paper presents a low-cost dc-dc distributed power-management
   architecture for a low-profile concentrating-photovoltaic (CPV) system.
   The proposed scheme uses inverting buck-boost converters connected
   across neighboring series-connected CPV cells to achieve a
   virtual-parallel connection and thus improve the tolerance of the
   overall system to parameter variations. Since the converters process the
   difference between corresponding cell currents and the string current,
   they have reduced power-handling and efficiency requirements. Current
   cascading is identified as the main challenge with this architecture.
   Statistical simulations are used to investigate the current
   distributions in the converters, and power benefits are analyzed using
   measured data from a six-cell CPV system. Experimental results from
   four-and three-cell systems using digitally controlled converters
   demonstrate clear power benefits in the presence of tracker misalignment
   and short-circuit current mismatches.}},

   behavior results in chaotic limit cycle behavior causing higher than
   expected in-band phase noise and strong spurious tones. This behavior is
   dependent on the initial phase difference between the output and
   reference clock which makes the DPLL performance inconsistent and
   unpredictable. To alleviate this problem, a noise shaped offset is added
   to the phase error, in the digital domain to keep the TDC active and
   away from the dead-zone. The proposed solution is verified by extensive
   simulation and using a DPLL prototype in a 0.13 mu m CMOS process.}},

Abstract = {{Non-generating resources (NGRs) such as energy storage and demand
   response can absorb intermittency from the steadily rising number of
   wind and solar installations. While there is clear advantage in drawing
   reserves jointly from NGRs and conventional power sources, there are
   marked differences between the two, which necessitate new market formats
   specifically tailored to the characteristics of NGRs. Salient
   differences from traditional ancillary markets include reduced output
   duration and faster start-up requirements.
   In line with the numerous game theoretic analyses of competition in
   primary generation markets, we analyze strategic behavior between NGRs
   providing fast regulation in reserve markets. We apply a two-stage
   framework in which firms first declare capacities and then engage in
   price bidding; the latter stage is commonly known as Bertrand-Edgeworth
   competition. We obtain new theoretical results pertaining to equilibrium
   uniqueness when the demand, in this case energy, is random. By applying
   the model to energy storage competition, we obtain direct comparisons
   between two representative market formats based on capacity and energy
   payments. We find that energy payments may lead to slightly more
   predictable NGR capacity commitment and reduced regulation energy prices}},

Abstract = {{We study a two-terminal secret-key generation problem over a two-way,
   approximately reciprocal, block-fading channel. The channel gains
   between the legitimate terminals are not revealed to any terminal,
   whereas the channel gains of the eavesdropper are revealed perfectly to
   the eavesdropper. We study a separation based scheme that involves a
   training phase followed by a communication phase within each block. The
   training phase generates correlated estimates of the channel state
   sequence between the two terminals, whereas the communication phase
   generates correlated source sequences between the two terminals. A
   portion of the secret-key is generated from the correlated channel state
   sequences by creating omniscience between the legitimate terminals and
   the remainder of the secret-key is generated from the correlated source
   sequences. An upper bound on the secret-key capacity is also established
   by reducing the setup to a coherent channel by providing genie-aided
   side information to the receivers. We observe that the diffrence between
   the upper and lower bound decreases as 1/T in the high
   signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. Numerical results indicate that the
   proposed scheme achieves significant gains over the commonly used
   training-only schemes even for moderate SNR.}},

Title = {{EVOLVING A RUBRIC FOR USE IN ASSESSING ENGINEERING GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES
   IN A STUDENT SENIOR RESEARCH THESIS}},

Abstract = {{This paper describes the process of developing and utilizing a rubric
   for graduate attributes assessment in a large senior research thesis
   course in a multidisciplinary engineering program. Each year, nearly 200
   students work with over 100 supervisors from across several academic
   departments at the university on the thesis, which is designed to
   provide students with opportunity to conduct, document, and experience
   engineering related research as an undergraduate student.
   Recently, changes to the Canadian Engineering Accreditation
   requirements, following the example set by the ABET, have called for the
   measurement of 12 graduate attributes in the engineering curriculum.
   Given that thesis is a requirement for all senior students in the
   program, and that it serves as a capstone experience, capitalizing on
   students' earlier work in engineering communication and experimentation,
   it stands as an ideal place in which to measure students' skills in
   these areas at graduation.
   However, the variability of these projects presents significant
   challenges for common rubric development and by implication, our ability
   to retrieve reliable data on student performance in these
   categories/attributes. This variability also brings unique challenges to
   the development of a single rubric that is 1) flexible enough to apply
   to a variety of engineering thesis projects, 2) reflective of the
   learning objectives of the thesis course, and also 3) appropriate for
   use in gathering reliable data about students' graduate attributes.
   This paper describes the development of the rubric, and the inherent
   challenges in designing a valid and reliable tool that provides
   flexibility to a diverse group of projects and supervisors, and serves
   the needs of the graduate attribute reporting. Despite these tensions,
   the results provided by this process provide insight about the rubric
   design, supervisors' assessment strategies and the students' strengths
   and weaknesses within the two graduate attributes, providing valuable
   information to feed back into the curriculum and thesis experience. The
   process of assessing graduate attributes within a curricular context
   also highlights the opportunity in allowing major curricular components
   to help define the learning outcomes associated with the graduate
   attributes, rather than relying only on a top-down process, focused on
   centrally-developed learning outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{This paper explores the impacts of gamification on students'
   investigations in a reverse engineering activity. The activity, which
   occurs in the first month of a freshman design and communication
   cornerstone course, challenges students to develop an understanding of
   how design decisions are made and the trade-offs involved in realizing a
   work of engineering design. In the most recent iteration of the
   activity, we created a game whereby students were awarded achievement
   levels for (1) practicing safety, (2) developing an understanding of key
   design decisions (construed as Design for X {[}DfX]), and (3) making
   inferences for logical argumentation in discussion with instructors.
   Although the reverse engineering activity did not directly include
   significant rewards, we employed gamification to challenge students to
   achieve a broader set of tasks and to achieve these tasks in deeper and
   more nuanced ways. Our preliminary analysis of the gamification of the
   exercise investigates the teaching team experience, in particular the
   nature of their interactions with the students, the students' perception
   of the quality of the experience, and the students' results in the form
   of an oral presentation of their device teardown. This simple approach
   enhanced the students' collaboration, their ability to handle rebuttals
   and make solid arguments based on physical evidence, and their
   understanding of the significance of DfX.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, there has been a tremendous increase in the number
   of biomedical engineering/bioengineering (BME/BE) programs offering
   lecture courses in tissue engineering (TE), yet very few offer a lab
   component or separate lab course. Given that engineering is an applied
   field, the benefits of hands-on lab experience are clear. A new textbook
   entitled A Laboratory Course in Tissue Engineering will be published by
   Taylor Francis and CRC Press in summer 2012. The lab manual is
   appropriate for upper-division undergraduates or graduate students
   without prior hands-on TE experience, the content and structure are
   intended to facilitate development of new TE lab courses, and an
   instructor's manual is available. The experiments within the book are
   based on both classic TE experiments and modern TE techniques and
   emphasize the importance of engineering analysis, mathematical modeling,
   and statistical design of experiments. All of the experiments have been
   extensively tested and refined to improve the likelihood of successful
   data collection. Seven representative labs were formally assessed during
   the fall 2011 academic quarter at the University of California, San
   Diego. Results from an anonymous survey conducted at the end of the
   quarter indicate that learning outcomes were achieved and that students
   found the experiments both enjoyable and challenging. A Laboratory
   Course in Tissue Engineering provides a convenient source of
   instructional materials and, to our knowledge, will be the first
   commercially available lab manual for TE instruction.}},

Abstract = {{This paper evaluates the process and outcomes of converting a library
   orientation tutorial into a game in a cornerstone design and
   communication class in the Engineering Science program at the University
   of Toronto. The purpose of the tutorial is to help students meet many of
   the Information Literacy Standards for Science and
   Engineering/Technology, as well as introduce them to important resources
   in their field. A hands-on tutorial session aims to move 300 students
   (100 per session) from a reliance on brute force and shallow approaches
   towards refining their techniques for information discovery and
   evaluation - working smarter not harder. The idea of making a game aimed
   to create incentives for learning, to allow for self-paced learning, and
   to introduce students to the professional body of knowledge they will
   need as professional engineers.
   The idea of gamifying activities for students offers a new approach to
   teaching that we evaluate in terms of outcomes, and in comparison with
   the previous pre-game version of the activity. Our evaluation of the
   activity considers the design of effective achievement levels and
   learning areas, logistical concerns of large numbers of students in a
   library, and achievement of learning outcomes. Overall student were more
   motivated and attained library search strategies; moreover, we have seen
   improved learning transfer to subsequent course activities. For these
   reasons, we find that gamification offers motivation in the educational
   setting that activates the competitive nature of engineering students,
   while enabling faster development of skills than prior methods.}},

Abstract = {{We present, for the first time an in vivo implementation of dynamic
   light scattering (DLS) adapted to optical coherence tomography (OCT).
   Human bladder carcinoma tumors were grown in dorsal skin-fold window
   chambers fitted to male nude mice and imaged at a rate of 200 Hz using
   OCT. Maps of speckle decorrelation times (DT) were generated for regions
   of skin from individual mice as well as for regions containing tumor
   tissue before and after treatment with chemotherapy. Variations in DT
   were found between individual mice exhibiting different skin anatomy
   (primarily due to deterioration from the window chamber implantation). A
   significant difference in DT was also observed between tumor regions and
   surrounding normal tissue. Finally, maps of DT generated for tumor
   tissue treated with chemotherapy indicated a drop in DT at 24 and 48
   hours after treatment. These preliminary results suggest the feasibility
   of using DLS-OCT to measure intracellular motion as an endogenous
   contrast mechanism in vivo.}},

Abstract = {{Checkpointing support allows program execution to roll-back to an
   earlier program point, discarding any modifications made since that
   point. Existing software-based checkpointing methods are mainly
   libraries that snapshot all of working-memory, and hence have
   prohibitive overhead for many potential applications. In this paper we
   present a lightweight, fine-grain checkpointing framework implemented
   entirely in software through compiler transformations and optimizations.
   A programmer can specify arbitrary checkpoint regions via a simple API,
   and the compiler automatically transforms the code to implement the
   checkpoint at the granularity of individual stores, optimizing to remove
   redundancy. We explore two application areas for this support. First, we
   investigate its application to debugging, in particular by providing the
   ability to rewind to an arbitrarily-placed point in a buggy program's
   execution. A study using BugBench applications shows that our
   compiler-based approach is more than 100x less overhead than
   full-process checkpointing. Second, we demonstrate that compiler-based
   checkpointing support can be leveraged to free the programmer from
   manually implementing and maintaining software rollback mechanisms when
   coding a back-tracking algorithm, with runtime overhead of only 15\%
   compared to the manual implementation.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter presents a general decision theoretic model of interactions
   between users and cognitive assistive technologies for various tasks of
   importance to the elderly population. The model is a partially
   observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose goal is to work in
   conjunction with a user towards the completion of a given activity or
   task. This requires the model to monitor and assist the user, to
   maintain indicators of overall user health, and to adapt to changes. The
   key strengths of the POMDP model are that it is able to deal with
   uncertainty, it is easy to specify, it can be applied to different tasks
   with little modification, and it is able to learn and adapt to changing
   tasks and situations. This chapter describes the model, gives a general
   learning method which enables the model to be learned from partially
   labeled data, and shows how the model can be applied within our research
   program on technologies for wellness. In particular, we show how the
   model is used in four tasks: assisted handwashing, stroke
   rehabilitation, health and safety monitoring, and wheelchair mobility.
   The first two have been fully implemented and tested, and results are
   summarized. The second two are meant to demonstrate how the POMDP can be
   applied across a wide variety of domains, but do not have specific
   implementations or results. The chapter gives an overview of ongoing
   work into each of these areas, and discusses future directions.}},

Abstract = {{It is a challenging and fundamental problem to construct the underlying
   overlay network to support efficient and scalable information
   distribution in topic-based publish/subscribe systems. Existing overlay
   design algorithms aim to minimize the node fan-out while building
   topic-connected overlays, in which all nodes interested in the same
   topic are organized in a directly connected dissemination sub-overlay.
   However, most state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from high computational
   complexity, such as O(vertical bar V vertical bar(4)vertical bar T
   vertical bar), where V is the node set and T is the topic set.
   We devise a general indexing data structure that provides a
   significantly faster implementation, with O(vertical bar V vertical
   bar(4)vertical bar T vertical bar) running time, for different
   state-of-the-art algorithms. The generality of the indexing data
   structure is due to the fact that it enables edge lookup by both node
   degree and edge contribution, a central metric in all existing
   algorithms. When tested on typical pub/sub workloads, the speedup
   observed was by a factor of over 1 000, thereby rendering the algorithms
   more suitable for practical use. For example, under a typically Zipf
   distributed pub/sub workload, with 1 000 nodes and 100 topics, our new
   implementation completes in 3.823 seconds, while the previous
   alternative takes over 555 minutes.}},

Abstract = {{The metabolic behavior of cancer cells is adapted to meet their
   proliferative needs, with notable changes such as enhanced lactate
   secretion and glucose uptake rates. In this work, we use the Ensemble
   Modeling (EM) framework to gain insight and predict potential drug
   targets for tumor cells. EM generates a set of models which span the
   space of kinetic parameters that are constrained by thermodynamics.
   Perturbation data based on known targets are used to screen the entire
   ensemble of models to obtain a sub-set, which is increasingly
   predictive. EM allows for incorporation of regulatory information and
   captures the behavior of enzymatic reactions at the molecular level by
   representing reactions in the elementary reaction form. In this study, a
   metabolic network consisting of 58 reactions is considered and accounts
   for glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, lipid metabolism, amino
   acid metabolism, and includes allosteric regulation of key enzymes.
   Experimentally measured intracellular and extracellular metabolite
   concentrations are used for developing the ensemble of models along with
   information on established drug targets. The resulting models predicted
   transaldolase (TALA) and succinyl-CoA ligase (SUCOAS1m) to cause a
   significant reduction in growth rate when repressed, relative to
   currently known drug targets. Furthermore, the results suggest that the
   synergistic repression of transaldolase and glycine
   hydroxymethyltransferase (GHMT2r) will lead to a threefold decrease in
   growth rate compared to the repression of single enzyme targets.}},

Abstract = {{This chapter discusses the feasibility of using the Electrocardiogram
   (ECG) for human identification. ECG falls under the umbrella of medical
   biometrics, i.e., physiological signals that are typically used for
   disease diagnosis, but also carry subject discriminative information. As
   opposed to traditional static biometric modalities like the iris, the
   fingerprint or the face, ECG is a time dependent signal affected both by
   physical and emotional activities. Therefore, one of the challenges that
   are studied in this work is the design of permanent and, at the same
   time discriminative features, which are robust to heart rate changes.
   A feature extraction methodology based on the autocorrelation of ECG
   recordings is presented and evaluated on a public database. In addition,
   the advantages of using the standard 12 lead ECG system in the
   recognition process are discussed, and various fusion strategies are
   presented. Experimental results indicate increased recognition accuracy
   for the fused case (100\% for 14 subjects).
   Furthermore, this chapter advocates ECG biometrics as a natural choice
   for handling medical information. Given the medical origin of the signal
   and the fact that in a clinical setting this measurement is collected
   irrespective of the recognition task, an ECG based biometric signature
   can be used to manage the patient's information. A body area network
   (BAN) is described as the application environment, while the findings
   can be generalized for a wide range of clinical settings.}},

   technologies are non-contact, requiring no devices to be attached to the
   user. We present two major categories of access: corporeal access
   whereby the user interacts with his or her environment using gross
   movements of the limbs, trunk or head; and orofacial access where the
   user connects to the environment via gestures of the mouth. After
   introducing the fundamentals of each type of access technology, we
   provide clinical illustrations of how these technologies have been
   applied in the home or community setting. The chapter concludes with a
   discussion of the merits and limitations of computer vision-based access

Abstract = {{Dynamic fracture plays a vital role in various geophysical processes and
   engineering applications involving rocks (e.g., earthquakes, rock
   cutting, blasting rock bursts). Accurate measurements of dynamic rock
   fracture parameters such as fracture initiation toughness, fracture
   energy, fracture propagation toughness, and fracture velocity are
   prerequisite for understanding mechanisms of fracture and are also
   beneficial for rock engineering applications. This paper describes two
   methods to simultaneously measure key dynamic Mode-I fracture parameters
   in Split Hopkinson Pressure Bar (SHPB) testing: 1) the Notched
   Semi-Circular Bend (NSCB) method and 2) the Cracked Chevron Notch
   Brazilian Disc (CCNBD) method. The pulse shaping technique has been
   employed to achieve force equilibrium on both ends of the samples and
   thus guarantee a quasi-static stress state in each sample. A strain
   gauge is mounted on the sample surface near the notch tip to detect the
   fracture-induced strain release and a Laser Gap Gauge (LGG) is developed
   to monitor the Crack Surface Opening Displacement (CSOD) of the
   specimen. The initiation toughness is obtained from the peak load given
   dynamic force equilibrium, and the fracture energy, the propagation
   toughness and the fracture velocity can be estimated with the aid of the
   LGG. The feasibility of both methodologies (SCB and CCNBD) is
   demonstrated with the SHPB experiments on Laurentian granite.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a medical imaging technique used in
   radiology to visualize the detailed internal structure and body soft
   tissues in complete 3D image. MRI performs best when optimal imaging
   parameters such as contrast, signal to noise ratio (SNR), spatial
   resolution and total scan time are utilized. However, due to a variety
   of imaging parameters that differ with the manufacturer, a calibration
   medium that allows the control of these parameters is necessary.
   Therefore, a phantom that behaves similar to human soft tissue is
   developed to replace a real human. Polymer gel is novel material that
   has great potential in the medical imaging. Since very few have focused
   on examining the behavior of polymer lesions, the motivation of this
   study is to develop a polymer gel phantom, especially for liver, with
   embedded lesions. Both the phantom and lesions should be capable of
   reflecting T-1 and T-2 relaxation values through various
   characterization processes.
   In this paper, phantom and lesion particles were fabricated with
   carrageenan as a gelling agent by physical aggregation. Agar was used as
   supplementary gelling agent and T-2 modifier and Gd-DTPA as T-1
   modifier. The polymer gel samples were fabricated by varying the
   concentrations of the gelling agent, and T-1 and T-2 modifiers. The
   lesion particles were obtained by extracting molten polymer gel solution
   in chilled oil bath to obtain spherical shape. The polymer gel
   properties including density, elastic modulus, dielectric constant and
   optical properties were measured to compare with human tissue values for
   long period of time.}},

   differences between the formulations of combined continuum-interface
   techniques and those of discrete-based approaches are outlined. It is
   shown that mathematically, for the case of an edge-to-edge contact,
   penalty enforcement of contact constraints in discrete element methods
   is identical to the finite element method with interface elements.
   Finally, guidelines for choosing between continuum and discontinuous

Title = {{Strategies for ocular siRNA delivery: Potential and limitations of
   non-viral nanocarriers}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING}},

Abstract = {{Controlling gene expression via small interfering RNA (siRNA) has opened
   the doors to a plethora of therapeutic possibilities, with many
   currently in the pipelines of drug development for various ocular
   diseases. Despite the potential of siRNA technologies, barriers to
   intracellular delivery significantly limit their clinical efficacy.
   However, recent progress in the field of drug delivery strongly suggests
   that targeted manipulation of gene expression via siRNA delivered
   through nanocarriers can have an enormous impact on improving
   therapeutic outcomes for ophthalmic applications. Particularly,
   synthetic nanocarriers have demonstrated their suitability as a
   customizable multifunctional platform for the targeted intracellular
   delivery of siRNA and other hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs in ocular
   applications. We predict that synthetic nanocarriers will simultaneously
   increase drug bioavailability, while reducing side effects and the need
   for repeated intraocular injections. This review will discuss the recent
   advances in ocular siRNA delivery via non-viral nanocarriers and the
   potential and limitations of various strategies for the development of a
   `universal' siRNA delivery system for clinical applications.}},

Abstract = {{Novel nanoporous structures have been formed by electrochemical
   dealloying of ternary precursors (i.e., Ag-Au-Pt with a platinum content
   of ca. 1, 2 and 4 at.\% and 77 at.\% of silver) in acidic media.
   Dealloying is a common corrosion process in which the less-noble element
   is selectively dissolved from the metallic solid solution, leaving
   behind a nanoporous sponge composed almost entirely of the more noble
   alloy constituents. The presence of Pt, even in such a small
   concentrations, reduces the feature size of the nano-structure(< 7 nm),
   minimizes coarsening of the porosity and helps preserve the structural
   integrity of the structure. Furthermore, these structures show greater
   catalytic activity for methanol electrooxidation reaction in alkaline
   solutions, if compared with the nanoporous structure formed from Ag-Au
   alloy (77 at.\% of silver). This enhancement is exemplified by a broad
   and high anodic peak during the positive scan and two secondary
   oxidation peaks in the subsequent reverse scan.}},

Abstract = {{In this research, we intend to introduce multifunctionality into epoxy
   adhesives through the homogeneous dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).
   Specifically, we are interested in improving the mechanical properties
   and electrical conductivity of the adhesive. The increased electrical
   conductivity would facilitate the use of the embedded nanofillers for
   sensing in situ local damage, thus allowing the quantitative in-flight
   self-health monitoring of structural adhesive bonds (SABs). In this
   presentation, we will outline the progress made so far and the
   challenges we are facing. Specifically, we will address the first phase
   in which the authors have developed numerical models to study the
   behavior of CNTs, nano reinforced interfaces and the tailoring of
   mechanical and electrical properties.}},

Abstract = {{In the past decade, formal tools have increased functional verification
   efficiency by exhaustively searching for hard to find bugs. Often the
   counter-examples returned are not due to design bugs but due to missing
   constraints that are needed to model the surrounding environment. These
   types of false positives have become a great concern in the industry
   today. To address this issue, input constraints are typically added by
   the engineer to restrict the input space a formal tool is allowed to
   explore. These constraints are difficult to generate as they are usually
   implicit in the documentation or implementation of adjacent design
   blocks. As a consequence, this process reduces the efficiency of formal
   methodologies because missing input constraints must be determined
   before deep design bugs can actually be detected.
   In this work, we present an algorithm to automatically generate missing
   input constraints given a failing counter-example. The process begins by
   building a filtering function that models the failing behaviors from the
   counter-example. Next, using this function a list of fixed cycle
   properties are generated and filtered to return a set of candidate input
   constraints for use in debugging. Preliminary experimental results show
   that the generated properties provide a strong intuition as to what
   input constraints may be missing.}},

Abstract = {{Direct injection natural gas (DING) engines offer the advantages of high
   thermal efficiency and high power output compared to spark ignition
   natural gas engines. Injected natural gas requires some form of ignition
   assist in order to ignite in the time available in a diesel engine
   combustion chamber. A glow plug - a heated surface - is one form of
   ignition assist.
   Simple experiments show that the thickness of the heat penetration layer
   of a glow plug is very small (approximate to 10(-5) m) within the time
   scale of the ignition preparation period (1-2 ms). Meanwhile, the
   theoretical analyses reveal that only a very thin layer of the
   surrounding gases (in micrometer scale) can be heated to high
   temperature to achieve spontaneous ignition. A discretized glow plug
   model and virtual gas sub-layer model have been developed for CFD
   modeling of glow plug ignition and combustion for DING diesel engines.
   In this paper, CFD modeling results are presented. The results were
   obtained using a KIVA3 code modified to include the above mentioned new
   developed models. Natural gas ignition over a bare glow plug was
   simulated. The results were validated against experiments. Simulation of
   natural gas ignition over a shielded glow plug was also carried out and
   the results illustrate the necessity of using a shield.
   This paper shows the success of the discretized glow plug model working
   together with the virtual gas sub-layer model for modeling glow plug
   assisted natural gas direct injection engines. The modeling can aid in
   the design of injection and ignition systems for glow plug assisted DING
   engines.}},

   The equations of motion are derived by means of the Hamilton principle

   the axial load, the magnitude and location of the mass-spring-mass
   system on the lowest five natural frequencies and mode shapes. The
   results indicate that the fundamental mode is independent of the tension

Abstract = {{Vibration-based energy harvesting using piezoelectric materials has
   gained considerable attention over the past decade. Currently, most
   piezoelectric energy harvesters (PEHs) are single resonance frequency
   based. The performance of a single-resonance PEH is often limited to
   only one resonance frequency. This paper discusses the possibility of
   improving the performance of a bimorph PEH by tuning the PEH using a
   spring-mass system attached to the bimorph's free. end. Through adding
   the spring-mass system, the PEH's resonance frequency can be tuned to
   match the ambient vibration frequency, and its voltage/power-generating
   capability can be improved. An electromechanical model of the PEH is
   derived based on the Lagrange multiplier method. The model is then used
   in a harmonic base excitation case study, and the coupled
   electromechanical outputs are discussed. Simulation results show that
   the spring-mass attachment can create two resonant frequencies, making
   the PEH capable of working efficiently at two different frequencies in a
   low-frequency level. It is also shown that by properly selecting the
   spring stiffness and the mass, the voltage and power output of the PEH
   can be greatly increased as compared to a single bimorph without the
   spring-mass system.}},

Abstract = {{The cyclic deformation behavior of two phase metastable beta
   Ti-5A1-5V-5Mo-3Cr alloy was systematically investigated under the
   pull-push low cycle fatigue (LCF) tests with a total strain control
   testing mode at room temperature. The beta-alpha bimodal microstructure
   demonstrated the micromechanical heterogeneity upon strain cycling,
   leading to special macroscopic behavior, i.e. early cyclic hardening at
   low strain amplitude; cyclic softening when the strain amplitude was
   high; and initial hardening followed by softening in the intermediate
   strain range. The role of primary alpha(p) particles is found to be
   particularly important in accommodating the cyclic plastic strain. The
   participation of the transformed beta phase including the lenticular
   alpha(s) precipitates embedded in the beta matrix was detected at high
   strain amplitude. The activation of slip activities in a, mainly gave
   rise to initially moderate hardening response. Dislocation annihilation
   upon cycling both in the alpha(p)/beta and alpha(s)/beta interfaces on
   the side of alpha(p) and alpha(s) particles was found to be the main
   reason for the softening behavior.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, the cyclic deformation behavior of the
   beta-annealed metastable Ti-5A1-5V-5Mo-3Cr alloy in pure compressive
   fatigue tests is thoroughly investigated. The material illustrates the
   initial cyclic softening followed by saturation irrespective of the
   employed stress levels. The progressive observation of
   surface-microstructure evolution reveals typical planar slip behavior
   and early formation of strain localization-induced microcracks. Upon
   cycling, the annihilation, i.e. reduced dislocation density and
   simplified dislocation configurations, as well as the detwinning and
   changed twin boundary structures have been well illustrated by the
   transmission electron microscopy (TEM) investigation. These activities
   in combination with the omega-penetration process are considered to
   introduce the initial softening behaviour; and the dislocation flip-flop
   is attributed to the following cyclic saturation response. In
   consideration of the stacking fault energy (SFE), the
   free-electron-to-atom (e/a) ratio, and the as received microstructure,
   the strain localized planar slip behavior is discussed. The shearing
   process of nano-scaled omega precipitates is related to the strain
   localization phenomenon as well.}},

   V-P measured along the sigma(2) and sigma(3) directions both show an
   initial 10\% increase up to the failure point followed by a 2 and 5\%

Abstract = {{Laser scanning, whether airborne or terrestrial is being used nowadays
   for wide spectrum of applications. In addition, many advances have been
   introduced to the laser scanning technology in the last decade; thus
   resulting into increased performance in terms of the point density,
   scanner range, and expected point accuracy. On the other hand, users are
   encountering scenarios where the integration of various laser datasets
   becomes essential in order to avoid data gaps (e.g., missing building
   roofs in the terrestrial scans, or missing structure facades in the
   airborne case). This problem is usually solved seamlessly through a
   classical transformation when the average point accuracy is relatively
   homogeneous over a given dataset. However, this is not usually the case;
   in this work, we propose a workflow for the optimal registration of
   multisource point clouds using weighted conformal transformation. First,
   the individual scans are filtered and the local point attributes are
   populated through a data characterization step. Then, an ICPP-based
   weighted registration algorithm is performed over the entire datasets
   until convergence. Finally, our heterogeneous segmentation procedure is
   performed in a simultaneous fashion to ensure exploiting the full
   potential of a dataset. The performance of this algorithm in terms of
   correctness, automation level, and other factors is evaluated using real
   datasets with significant variations in point densities and accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Digital Building Model is an important component in many applications
   such as city modelling, natural disaster planning, and aftermath
   evaluation. The importance of accurate and up-to-date building models
   has been discussed by many researchers, and many different approaches
   for efficient building model generation have been proposed. They can be
   categorised according to the data source used, the data processing
   strategy, and the amount of human interaction. In terms of data source,
   due to the limitations of using single source data, integration of
   multi-senor data is desired since it preserves the advantages of the
   involved datasets. Aerial imagery and LiDAR data are among the commonly
   combined sources to obtain 3D building models with good vertical
   accuracy from laser scanning and good planimetric accuracy from aerial
   images. The most used data processing strategies are data-driven and
   model-driven ones. Theoretically one can model any shape of buildings
   using data-driven approaches but practically it leaves the question of
   how to impose constraints and set the rules during the generation
   process. Due to the complexity of the implementation of the data-driven
   approaches, model-based approaches draw the attention of the
   researchers. However, the major drawback of model-based approaches is
   that the establishment of representative models involves a manual
   process that requires human intervention. Therefore, the objective of
   this research work is to automatically generate building models using
   the Minimum Bounding Rectangle algorithm and sequentially adjusting them
   to combine the advantages of image and LiDAR datasets.}},

Abstract = {{A lot of research on nanomaterials has been carried out in recent years.
   However, there is still a lack of nanostructures that have a combination

   flower-like morphology which exhibits both superior electron transport
   and high surface area. Intrigued by the unique properties of Fe2O3 at
   the nanoscale and its abundance in nature, we have demonstrated a facile
   template-free solution based synthesis of hybrid alpha-Fe2O3 comprising
   nanopetals nucleating radially from a 3D core. Due to its simplicity,
   the synthesis process can be easily reproduced and scaled up. We carried
   out in-depth studies on gas sensing and dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC)
   device characterization so as to gain an understanding of how surface
   area and transport properties are affected by variation in morphology.
   The hybrid alpha-Fe2O3 nanostructures are studied as potential

Abstract = {{Structural systems, including space-frames, cable stayed roof systems
   and bridges, with elements that intersect at non-orthogonal angles
   necessitating rotated and complex connection geometries, have become
   commonplace. Non-orthogonal plate-to-circular hollow section (CHS)
   connections with branch members rotated about their own axis (skewed)
   have been absent in international literature and design guidelines. A
   numerical finite element parametric study is presented on the behaviour
   of skewed X-type plate-to-CHS connections loaded under branch plate
   tension. A total of 91 connections with wide-ranging values of geometric
   properties were modelled and analysed using commercially available
   finite element software. The numerical finite element analysis indicated
   a smooth sigmoidal (S-shaped) transition between longitudinal and
   transverse orthogonal extremes. A non-linear interpolation function was
   developed, for application between longitudinal and transverse design
   recommendations, that adequately predicts skewed connection behaviour
   over a wide range of geometric connection configurations. A partial
   design strength function for skewed X-type plate-to-CHS, which builds on
   existing design recommendations for non-skewed plate connections, is
   hence proposed with lower bound reduction (resistance) factors. (C) 2011

   to a Neural Network. The input to the first hybrid model is complemented
   by historical values of other explanatory variables. The second hybrid
   model takes as inputs both series of the simulated data and explanatory
   variables. The forecasts obtained by each of those hybrid models have
   been compared with those of EGARCH model in terms of closeness to the
   realized volatility. The computational results demonstrate that the
   second hybrid model provides better volatility forecasts. (C) 2011
